PEIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.
THE third of the series of private meetings for members and
associates only, was held at 20 Hanover Square, W., on Monday,
December 8th, at 8.30 p.m.—the President, Sir Oliver Lodge, in
the chair. A paper, contributed under the pseudonym of Edward
G-recnu-ood, on " Some Recent Hypnotic Experiments," was read
by Mr. Podmore. It will be published in the forthcoming
number of the Proceedings, and is therefore not epitomised here
At the conclusion of the paper, the President said that he was
sure that those who had had the advantage of listening to " Mr.
Greenwood's " report would agree with him in regarding it as a
valuable contribution to psychology ; and that a special interest
attached to the experiments, because the subject of them was a
man of intelligence and refinement.
He had been struck by the fact that the operator's suggestions
appear to have affected not the subject's sensory perceptions so
much as his will ; for instance, when given soap and told that it
A2
4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 190S.
tasted like chocolate, he seemed to be aware that it was soap, but
to be willing to agree that it tasted like chocolate. In fact, it
was a kind of exaggerated complaisance, an extremity of good
nature, which was produced in this instance ; but it would be too
rapid induction to conclude that different subjects would be
affected in the same way.
DR. LLOYD TUCKEY expressed his appreciation of " Mr. Green
wood's" excellent paper which presented several novel features.
In the well-known series of experiments carried out by Professor
Heidenhain on his brother and others the subjects were pro
foundly hypnotised and memory was abolished, or greatly
impaired; whereas "Mr. Greenwood's" subject seems to have
retained a normal memory. Being highly educated and in
telligent he was able to describe clearly the mental and bodily
sensations produced by suggestions. The experiments bore out
Bernheiin's theory that hypnotism did but increase susceptibility
to suggestion. ' Suggestibility ' is a varying quality dependent
upon individual idiosyncrasy. In some people it is very apparent
without hypnotism, as Bernheim found in his experiments on
patients in the hospital at Nancy. He was able to impress the
reality of scenes which he described on many patients so strongly
that they were prepared to swear to having seen them before a
magistrate. He attributed much false witness in law courts to
this excessive suggestibility. On the other hand, Forel and other
observers have found that people with a fixed idea often refuse to
part with it even when deeply hypnotised.
As to the power of hypnotic suggestion to make a person
commit a crime or moral offence, that again depended upon the
subject's receptivity of an idea. The man of high principle and
training would successfully resist evil suggestions, whilst the weak
or naturally vicious would readily yield to them. Resistance to
suggestion can sometimes be overcome by such an insidious
device as that practised by Bernheim, who made a patient steal a
neighbour's watch, though she at first refused, by assuring her
that it was veally her own property and had been stolen from
her. Dr. Tuckey thought it better to face the possible dangers
of hypnotism than to deny their existence.
MR. ADOLPHE SMITH, discussing the question of whether
subjects could be induced to commit criminal acts or not, agreed
with Dr. Tuckey that this would chiefly depend upon the
., 1903.] Private Meeting for Members and Associates. o
character of the person experimented on. You could probably
induce a criminal to commit crimes, but he did not believe that
hypnotism could destroy the honesty of an honest man. It
could do no more than increase natural tendencies in either
direction.
SIR LAWRENCE JONES observed that if a theory that Mr.
Podmore had tentatively advanced in his recent book were true,
visual and auditory hallucinations must be as common as black
berries. Yet here they found an exceptionally impressionable
subject readily susceptible to hallucinations of the senses of taste
and smell, yet wholly refractory to suggested hallucinations of the
senses of sight and hearing. He went on to describe a collective
hallucination of the sense of smell, which had been shared by a
large portion of a mixed public audience.
MR. PODMORE said that he did not think that the practical aspects
of the paper had received sufficient notice. We had numerous
records of prolonged and successful experiments with persons fully
entranced ; but he could scarcely recall another instance of a
course of experiments of the kind in question. It seemed not
improbable that this semi-hypnoid condition, when the subject,
though apparently normal, was yet profoundly amenable to
hypnotic suggestion, might be quite common ; for it is obvious
that, except with alert and intelligent subjects, its existence
might readily be overlooked. A state of this kind offered a
most fruitful field for investigation, and was not attended with
any of the inconveniences or drawbacks incident to experiments
in deep hypnotic trance. He was not, however, quite able to
accept " Mr. Greenwood's " conclusions as to the possibility of
inducing in this state the performance of crimes. " Mr. Green
wood's " conclusions were based on the subject's analysis of his
own mental condition ; and it was clear, from other parts of the
paper, that such an analysis could not be relied upon. The only
satisfactory way to test how far a criminal suggestion could
be carried would be to let it be carried out not under laboratory
conditions, but in real life. Unfortunately, the police stood in
the way of scientific investigation in this direction.
THE PRESIDENT drew attention to the ingenious method em
ployed by " Mr. Greenwood " in order to circumvent the moral
scruples and to gain the acquiescence of his subject, namely,
that of inducing, by suggestion, a mood in keeping with and
6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1903.
appropriate to the suggested act. After all, this was quite in
accord with everyday experience. We were led by our mood to
do things at a children's party which we should never dream of
doing, for instance, at meetings of the Society.
The success of a well-known experiment, already referred to
that evening by a previous speaker, in which a subject was
given arsenic and ordered to put it in someone's food, after
having been told that it was sugar, he could not regard as
indicative of the effectiveness of criminal suggestions, because it
may be supposed that the subject consented to the suggestion
only because he believed that the arsenic was sugar. The
experiment showed that a hypnotised subject could readily be
tricked into committing what Mr. Piddington would call a modal
crime, but then so might people not under hypnotic influence.
An improved form of the experiment would be to use sugar,
and to let the subject understand that it was arsenic ; though,
should the suggestion be duly carried out, even then it would be
improper to draw the conclusion that outside a laboratory
criminal suggestions may be accepted by a hypnotised subject,
because it was impossible to decide how far, in the case of
experiments, the subject does not retain, somewhere at the back
of his mind, an inkling that the whole thing is merely a kind of
game. The best test would consist in employing real arsenic,
only taking care to prevent its being actually swallowed : though
this last mental reserve would again partially detract from the
value of the experiment. There seemed little doubt but that
acts to which the subject was prone, or from which he was not
in his normal state fundamentally averse, might be precipitated
by suggestion : and therein lay a danger.
Sir L. Jones had cited an interesting case of collective olfactory
hallucination, which would be well worth having at first hand ;
but it must be borne in mind that the sense of smell is the
lowest, the least intellectual of the senses, and it did not follow
that the higher senses of sight and hearing could be similarly
affected. The burden of proof would rest with the assertor
of highly-developed forms of collective hallucination ; and the
proof will be valuable when forthcoming.
The meeting then adjourned.
JAN., 1903.] S.P.R. and Psychic Research Company.
THE S.P.R AND THE PSYCHIC RESEARCH COMPANY.
WE have already in the Journal disowned all connection with
the Psychic Research Company ; and we should have thought
that the character of this trading Company was sufficiently
obvious from the advertisements which it issues, and from the
literature which it offers for sale.
The officials of the Society, however, continue to receive letters
from various members, associates, and others, misled apparently
by the similarity of the titles, to enquire if there is any con
nection between the Society and the Company.
We therefore emphatically repeat our former disclaimer, and
we beg that members and associates, whenever they find it
suggested or stated that the Society for Psychical Research is in
any way connected with the Psychic Research Company, will
make a point of dispelling the misapprehension.
We also take this opportunity to state that a body calling
itself " The Newcastle Society for Psychical Research " is not a
local branch of, nor in any way allied to the Society for Psychical
Research.

William Crookes. Sir William Crookes' work in psychical
research is sympathetically and intelligently reviewed and forms
the central topic of the paper, only brief allusion being made to
his attainments as a physicist.

AN EXPERIENCE WITH A DIRECT SLATE-WRITING
MEDIUM.
THE following contribution is from a member of the Society,
well known to us, who withholds both his name and the exact
date of his sitting, because he finds that if he signs his name
to an unfavourable report he is often in consequence deprived
of opportunities for further investigation.
On an afternoon of November, 1902, I called on "Palma" (Mr.
Grant), the Canadian direct slate-writing medium, at 281 Regent Street.
On my arrival I was shown by him into a small back room on the first
floor. At the end of the room there was a small table placed against a
window, the table was covered by a tablecloth, and on it rested a paper
weight, a large slate, a pile of small slates, and another pile of six small
slates of the same size. This last pile, which for convenience of
narration I will call my slates, was on the side of the table close to the
chair on which I was requested to sit. " Palma " handed me a piece of
stiff white paper 4 inches long by 3 inches wide, and desired me to
write thereon the full name of a person known to me who had departed
this life, to address him or her as dear friend, sister, father, etc., as the
case might be ; then to write a series of questions, and to sign myself by
the familiar or pet name by which I was known to the departed friend.
The medium then left the room, and, during his absence, I proceeded to
write the questions according to instructions, folded the paper into two
parts, and on the medium's return I handed it to him. This paper,
which he folded into four parts, he then placed under the paper-weight
JAN., 1903.] Experience with a Direct Slate-Writing Medium. 9
which lay on the table. A wet sponge and a rag were then given to
me, and I was asked to see that my slates had no writing on them, and
to carefully clean and wipe them. While I was doing this the medium
took the large slate from the table, retired to the other side of the room
opposite to where I sat, and proceeded to make a calculation on the
large slate regarding (as he informed me) my horoscope ; for which
purpose he asked the date of my birth.
On my having finished cleaning and wiping my six slates I placed
them in a pile on the table. " Palma " came to the table, put the large
slate close to mine, and then cleaned and wiped my slates himself.
After this he transferred the large slate to the top of the other pile of
small slates which were at the further end of the table. The medium
subsequently drew his chair close to mine, took the piece of paper
on which I had written the questions from under the paper-weight, and
desired me to put it in my pocket. He then held my right hand in one
of his, \vent under control of the spirit to whom I had addressed my
questions, answered them correctly, and referred to matters mentioned
in my letter to the deceased friend. The control then left, and
"Palma" let go my hand. After this the medium took up my six
slates and divided them into two piles of three each. On the top slate
of one of the piles he placed a small piece of slate pencil, together with
a piece of paper on which were some daubs of different coloured paints,
covered the pile on which rested the slate pencil and coloured paper
with the other three slates, and then asked me to take the paper with
the questions from my pocket and place it under the top slate.
My slates were then held, all together, at one end by me, and at the
other end by " Palma.'' In a short time the sound of writing was
heard, during which process the medium was convulsively agitated.
On the three top slates being removed, there on the fourth slate
appeared a message from my departed friend, written in slate pencil,
and covering the whole of one side of the slate, answering my questions
and addressing me in the familiar name by which I was known, and
signed with his name in full. On the slate, above the message, was
a painting of flowers in various colours.
The above is an account of the incidents of my seance with " Palma "
as they apparently occurred.
What really took place was as follows. When the medium returned
to the room, after I had finished writing my questions, he came provided
with a piece of blank, stiff, white paper, folded in four parts, concealed
in his hand, of the same size as the one he had handed to me.
On my giving him my piece he folded it into four parts to
10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1903.
correspond with the concealed one; he then proceeded to palm mine
and to substitute for it the blank one (this is a pass well known to
conjurors, and is easier to perform with thick stiff paper than with
thin). The blank piece he placed under the paper-weight, and retained
mine concealed in the palm of his right hand.
" Palma " then lifted the large slate from the table together with a
small slate which lay concealed under it and upon which the coloured
flowers had already been painted ; he retired to the other side of the
room where, under cover of the large slate and under pretence of
calculating my horoscope, he opened my paper, read my questions and
wrote the answers on the concealed small slate, copying, at the same
time, my familiar name and the full name of my deceased friend.
While he was thus employed I pretended to be busily engaged in
cleaning and wiping my six slates, but in reality I was secretly mark
ing each of them with a preparation I had brought with me which
could not be rubbed off. When the medium had finished his pretended
calculations he placed the large slate, with the concealed prepared
small -slate under it, on the table by the side of my slates. (The
writing on the small slate would then be on the under surface).
Under pretext of cleaning and wiping my slates, with which he
fumbled a good deal, he substituted one of them for the concealed
prepared slate, then made a pile of six slates consisting of five of
mine and the prepared one, and this last he took care should be at
the bottom of the pile with the writing on the under surface. After
this he removed the large slate from the surface of the table to the
top of the other pile of small slates which were farther away, thus
taking away from my vicinity, under cover of the large slate, the one
of my slates which had been substituted for the prepared one. The
medium then drew his chair close to mine, took the blank folded paper
from under the paper-weight, palmed it and substituted my own paper
which he handed to me with the request that I should place it in
my pocket.
The speech that followed, the medium meanwhile holding my right
hand, purported, of course, to come from the alleged control, but really
corresponded to the patter of a conjuror which is intended to divert
attention from the sequence of his movements. As the medium had
already read my questions, under cover of the large slate, when he
pretended to calculate my horoscope, the alleged control was naturally
able to answer them correctly and to refer to matters mentioned in my
letter. When " Palma " let go my hand he took up the three top
slates, placed the slate pencil and piece of paper with the daubs of
JAN., 1903.] Experience with a Direct Slatr-Writiiu/ Medium. 11
paint on the upper slate of this pile, then took the remaining three
slates, in one pile also, and placed them on the first pile, and finally
reversed the whole of the six slates. (After this movement the
prepared slate with the writing on the under surface, which had been
the bottom slate, would be then the fourth slate from the top and
would have the writing on the upper surface). I took the piece of
paper inscribed with my questions from my pocket and placed it,
as requested, under the top slate of the newly arranged pile of six
slates. I then held the slates at one end and the medium held them
at the other. The sound of writing which was then heard was
produced by "Palma" scratching the under slate with one of his
finger nails. During the process he was convulsively agitated, in order
that the movement of the muscles in his hand should not be detected.
The three top slates were removed and the writing was disclosed.
The writing on the slate does not resemble, in the least, that of my
deceased friend, but does resemble the medium's writing. A very
marked peculiarity in Palma's writing (a specimen of which is in my
possession) also appears in the writing on the slate.
At the end of the stance I examined the six slates; I found that
five of them were still wet and had my secret mark. The one with
the writing was perfectly dry and had not my mark, in fact was a
substituted slate which had not formed part of my original six slates.

MR. BROWNING ON D. D. HOME.
THE following letters appeared in The Times Literary Supplement
for November 28th, 1902 :
BROWNING ON SPIRITUALISM.
To THK EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,—The reviewer of Mr. Podmore's Modern Spiritualism, after
citing contradictory evidence on the question whether Mr. Browning
" caught Home out in a vulgar fraud," asks, " What can we make
of such evidence ? "
I happen to possess evidence which, at least, leaves no doubt of
the opinion Mr. Browning formed after witnessing one of Home's
performances. Its interest is added to by the contrast it offers to
the opinion of Mrs. Browning arrived at on the same occasion.
In July, 1855, my wife, to whom I was not then married, spent
an evening with me at the house where Home was then staying,
12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1903.
1—. ,
to which we were taken by friends who were firm believers in the
"manifestations" there. As a result I had not the smallest doubt
that the " spirit hands " which we saw were material and a fraud.
My wife formed a similar opinion, but knowing that others thought
differently, and that Mrs. Browning had lately been there, she wrote
to her, sending as an introduction an old letter from Miss Mitford,
and received an answer, a copy of which, and of the spontaneous
expression of his opinion added by Mr. Browning, I subjoin.
I give the whole of Mrs. Browning's letter, but the first and last
paragraphs in it, though possessing an interest of their own, do
not bear on the particular question.
Your obedient servant,
Brighton, Nov. 16. F. MERRIFIELD.
COPY OF LETTER FROM MRS. BROWNING.
"Dear Madam,—I hope you will pardon my delay in replying to
your letter, and attribute it to the right cause ; my time being
much occupied during our brief visit to London. You address me
in a name which could not do otherwise than move me to an
answer, even if the tone of your application had not made me willing
to be open with you on your own account.
" I went with my husband to witness the so-called spiritual mani
festations at Ealing. I enclose to you in his handwriting an account
of the impressions he received. Mine, I must frankly say, were
entirely different.
" The class of phenomena in question appears to me too numerous
not to be recognized as facts. I believe them to occur often under
circumstances which exclude the possibility of imposture. That
there is sometimes imposture is natural and necessary—for wherever
there is a truth there will be a counterfeit of the truth. But if
you ask me (as you do) whether I would rank the phenomena
witnessed at Ealing among the counterfeits, I sincerely answer
that I may be much mistaken, of course, but for my own part, and
in my own conscience, I find no reason for considering the medium
in question responsible for anything seen or heard on that occasion.
" Having said so much I am anxious to guard myself against mis
understanding. I consider that the idea of looking for theological
teaching, or any other sort of teaching, to these supposed spirits
would be absolutely disastrous. Also that the seeking for inter
course with any particular spirit would be apt to end in either
disappointment or delusion. In the present undeveloped state of
JAN., 1903.) Mr. Browning on D. D. Home. 13
the subject, with the tendency to personation on the part of the
(so-called) spirits, and the difficulties on ours as well as theirs, the
manifestations are apt to be so low, and our apprehensions so unsteady,
that we could hope to see our faces as well in a shivered looking-glass
as catch a clear view of a desired truth or lost friend by these
means. What we do see is a shadow on the window, a sign of
something moving without—the proof of, and beginning of, access
from a spiritual world—of which we shall presently learn more
perhaps, and I, for one, believe we shall. You may be unaware
that many persons who are called 'believers' in these things believe
simply in the physical facts, attribute them to physical causes,
and dismiss the spiritual theory as neither necessary nor tenable.
"This is not my view, however.
" I enclose back to you the letter of my dear friend, knowing
well the value of such a memorial. And with a most thankful
sense for the sympathy which you have given to myself personally,
"I remain very faithfully yours,
"ELIZABETH BARRKTT BROWNING.
"London, Wednesday."
FROM MR. BROWNING.
"Mr. Browning presents his compliments to Miss de Gaudrion,
and feels it his duty to say a word for himself in reply to her note
—though he has to overcome a real repugnance at recurring to
the subject of it.
" Mr. Browning did, in company with his wife, witness Mr. Hume's
(sic) performances at Baling on the night Miss de Gaudrion alludes
to, and he is hardly able to account for the fact that there can be
another opinion than his own on the matter—that being that the
whole display of 'hands,' 'spirit utterances,' etc., were a cheat
and imposture. Mr. Browning believes in the sincerity and good
faith of the family, and regrets proportionably that benevolent
and worthy people should be subjected to the consequences of those
admirable qualities of benevolence and worth when unaccompanied
by a grain of worldly wisdom—or, indeed, divine wisdom—either
of which would dispose of all this melancholy stuff in a minute. Mr.
Browning has, however, abundant experience that the best and rarest
of natures may begin by the proper mistrust of the more ordinary
results of reasoning when employed in such investigations as these,
go on to an abnegation of the regular tests of truth and rationality
in favour of these particular experiments, and end in a voluntary
1$ Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1903.
prostration of the whole intelligence before what is assumed to
transcend all intelligence. Once arrived at this point, no trick is
too gross—absurdities are referred to 'low spirits,' falsehoods to
' personating spirits '—and the one terribly apparent spirit, the
Father of Lies, has it all his own way. Mr. Browning had some
difficulty iu keeping from an offensive expression of his feelings at
the 'a; he has since seen Mr. Hume and relieved himself. Mr.
Browning recommends leaving the business to its natural termina
tion, and will console himself for any pain to the dupes by supposing
that their eventual profit in improved intelligence would be no
otherwise procurable.
"13 Dorset Street, Baker Street, Aug. 30, 1855."
A further letter from Mr. Barrett Browning was printed in The,
Times Literary Supplement 1'or December 5th, 1902, as follows :
To THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,—It is with reluctance that I ask your permission to make the
following remarks on the letters from my father and mother which have
been communicated to you by Mr. Merrifield.
Mr. Hume, who subsequently changed his name to Home, was
detected "in a vulgar fraud," for I have heard my father repeatedly
describe how he caught hold of his foot under the table. I also know
that when Mr. Hume called at our house he was turned out of it.
What, however, I am more desirous of stating is that towards the end
of her life my mother's views on " spiritual manifestations " were much
modified. This change was brought about, in a great measure, by the
discovery that she had been duped by a friend in whom she had blind
faith. The pain of the disillusion was great, but her eyes were opened,
and she saw clearly.
I am, sir, your obedient servant,
E. BARRETT BROWNING.
La Torre all' Antella, Florence. Dec. 1.
In connection with these letters we are allowed to state that Mr.
Merrifield was the writer of the account printed in the Journal,
Vol. IV., pp. 120-1, which gives a full description (written in
1889) of one of the Ealing sittings of 1855, and of the apparent
trickery observed. Mr. Merrifield writes :
24 Vernon Terrace, Brighton.
December 9, 1902.
I think there are none now living to whom the association of my
personality with the authorship of the account in the Journal of July,
JAN., 1903.] Mr. Browning on D. D. Home. 15
1889, could give pain, so I see no reason for withholding my name if it
is desired. But if it is published I should like this reason given.
With regard to the above correspondence, it is satisfactory that
the authorship of the hitherto anonymous account of a sitting with
D. D. Home which appeared in the Journal for July, 1889 (pp.
120-121), should now be divulged. Although Mr. Merrih'eld
did not write his account until 34 years after the sitting in ques
tion took place, and although for that reason it cannot rank so
highly as would a contemporaneously written report, still it merits
careful consideration, for it bears the impress of a careful
observer, who does not content himself with a mere ex cathedra
or emotional denunciation, but gives detailed reasons for the want
of faith that is in him. For a precisely contrary reason the
letters of Mr. and Mrs. Browning, although of interest as relating
to the same series of sittings as that to which Mr. Merrifield's
sitting belonged (a further reference to the same series will be
found in Mr. Podmore's Modern Spiritualism, Vol. II., pp. 233-
236) do not, in our opinion, throw any fresh lighten the problem
of Home's mediumship. We do not mean by this to suggest that
Mr. or Mrs. Browning were wanting in straightforwardness or
perspicuity because their private correspondence of 1855 does
not furnish such an exposure, or defence, or detailed record of
Home's phenomena, as our modern standard of evidence in such
matters demands ; we merely wish to urge that their letters make
no substantial contribution to the existing data.
Mr. Browning refers to no specific act of trickery : nor does
Mrs. Browning seem to have been called upon to meet on Home's
behalf any specific charge of fraud.
Mr. Browning's letter, no less than Mr. Sludge the Medium (in
spite of the prodigious introspective power therein displayed),
strikes us as tinged with the animus of the man of sensitive
temperament, whose disgust with the vulgarity of spiritualistic
phenomena precludes him from forming a calm estimate of their
authenticity ; and it may be permissible to surmise that, in Mr.
Browning's case, this animus may have been intensified by an
anxiety to save others, whose mental welfare was very precious to
him, from the ill-effects of precipitate credulity.
As for Mr. Barrett Browning's statement that he has heard his
' father repeatedly describe how he caught hold of his [i.e. Home's]
feet under the table,' it is worth nothing as evidence so long as
16 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1903.
the circumstances of the seizure are not described. Mr. Eobert
Browning might have caught hold of D. D. Home's foot many a
time, or pulled his leg, or even his nose, without fixing any, at
least moral, stigma on the medium, and without being justified in
deducing ' ex pcde Hcrcvlcm.' Furthermore, it is strange that
when Mr. Browning explained to Mr. Myers (v. Journal, Vol. IV.,
p. 102) " the circumstances which mainly led to that opinion of
Home which was expressed in Mr. Sludge the Medium" no
mention was apparently made of any seizure of the medium's
foot. Mr. Browning was ' powerfully impressed' by some un
recorded second-hand evidence about Home having been found
experimenting with phosphorus on the production of " spirit-
lights." Had any reference been made by Mr. Browning to his
having seized Home's foot under compromising circumstances Mr.
Myers could hardly have failed to have reported it, and to have
accorded due weight to Mr. Browning's first-hand evidence. If
Mr. Barrett Browning had recorded for the first time 47 years
after the event some recollection of his father's favourable to
Home's claims, we should have soon heard talk of ' mythopaeic
memory,' and we should in any case have been bound to reject
the evidence as worthless. And the same standard must apply to
the letters published in the Times. We hold no brief for D. D.
Home, but we think it right to guard against undue weight
being attached to them.
KEMINISCENCE OF A LONG-FOKGOTTEN LANGUAGE
DR. MEKCIER, in his remarks on this subject, quoted in the
October Journal, trots out the familiar case of the Hebrew-
talking maid-servant. It may be well to recall on what
evidence the case rests. Coleridge says in his Biographia
Litcra?-ia, I. 117, "It occurred in a Roman Catholic town in
Germany a year or two before my arrival in Gottingen " [in
January, 1799]. He goes on to say that an uneducated
young woman was heard by the monks and priests of the
neighbourhood to talk Latin, Greek and Hebrew with a very
distinct enunciation. A young physician took up the case,
and on the strength of his report many eminent psychologists
JA>-., 1903.] Reminiscence of a Long-Forgotten Language. 17
and physiologists visited the town. Sheets full of her ravings
were taken down and found to be intelligible, if disconnected,
utterances in the languages named above. Further inquiry
showed that the girl had seventeen years previously entered
the service of a Protestant pastor, who was in the habit of
declaiming aloud from his favourite books within earshot of
the kitchen. Among his books were found Latin, Greek
and Hebrew authors, in which many of the passages taken
down at the bedside of the young woman were traced and
identified.
It does not appear that Coleridge ever met the young
physician or any of the distinguished men of science who
investigated the case. He seems to have based his narrative
on the gossip of Gottingen some years after the event. It
is a highly suspicious circumstance that no report either of
the young physician or of the eminent personages who visited
the town has come down to us. Both the young physician,
the eminent personages, the town, the pastor, and the girl
herself are anonymous.
The story told by Coleridge may or may not be true.
For us it is at lest third-hand, and may be fourth or fifth-
hand. If the academic psychologist thinks that he is entitled
to quote his leading cases on no better evidence he has much
to learn from Psychical Eesearch.
It may not be uninstructive in this connection to glance at a
case reported in the papers this summer on the authority of a
correspondent of the Paris-Nouvelles. I take the facts from the
Revue des Etudes Psychiques. A sister at the orphanage of Grezes
was reported, in the newspapers of June 14th, to have spoken to
perfection Greek, Eussian, German, English, etc. She is even
stated to have spoken Carib with a bishop in partibus.
The Revue des Etudes Psychiques (July, 1902) quotes,
however, the following testimonies from the Paris papers.
The Mother Superior said to a correspondent of the Journal :
" It is untrue that she speaks languages unknown to her." Dr.
Seguret, her medical attendant, told a correspondent of the
Franfais that the sister had replied to a question in Carib
by a single word, which meant 'good day.' This he had at
first-hand, not having been present himself. As an explanation
he suggested the very probable theory that the bishop in question
18 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1903.
was expecting this answer, and that there was at most a case
of thought transference.
The writer of the original article professed to have collected
his information on the spot and on the best authority. If
his statements under these circumstances are so wide of the
truth it is not difficult to form an estimate of the value of
Coleridge's contribution to science.

Spiritualism, which dates from the "Rochester Rappings" of 1848, is in
substance a criticism of the belief and of the foundation on which it rests.
The belief in spirit intercourse is traced back, on the one hand, through
Mesmerism and Animal Magnetism, to Alchemy ; on the other, through
Poltergeists and •' electric " girls, to Witchcraft and the Hysterical
" possessions" of the Middle Ages. The author shows how the belief in
America, the land of its birth, was incubated in the trance revelations of
Andrew Jackson Davis : how it spread with epidemic rapidity through the
American continent, and reached Europe in 1853. Its history in this country
in given at length, and the book concludes with a detailed criticism of the
chief items of evidence relied on by modem Spiritualists and the marvellous
feats of Eusapia Paladino, the slate writing of Eglinton, the experiments
made by Zolluer with Slade, and by Sir W. Crookes and others with D. D.
Home.
The author's conclusions are mainly negative, but in the clairvoyant
revelations of Mrs. Piper he finds something still unexplained.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL TO THE MEMBERS AND
ASSOCIATES OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL
RESEARCH FOR THE YEAR 1902.
WITH a view to laying before the Society a somewhat fuller
account than was contained in the statement made to the
Annual Meeting, the Council report as follows of the work
done during the year 1902:
Some important changes were effected during the year. At
the end of March Mr. E. T. Bennett retired from the post of
Assistant Secretary, which he had held for twenty years. The
Council desire to express their appreciation of his long and
faithful services. Mr. N. W. Thomas was appointed as Organis
ing Secretary, and at the end of March the rooms of the
Society were removed from Buckingham Street to more con
venient quarters at 20 Hanover Square, London, W.
With regard to the balance-sheet for the year, appended
below, a few points may be noted. The most Satisfactory
feature in it is the amount of the annual subscriptions, which
show an increase of £153 over those of 1901. In the latter
year (in which the amount was larger than ever before), there
had been an increase of £73 over the year before, so that the
main source of income of the Society has been rising during
these years, whereas during the four previous years it had
been falling.
Further special subscriptions and donations were received
in response to the appeal issued by the Council in 1901, and
there was besides a special donation of £750, which formed
the nucleus of the Endowment Fund announced below.
The sales of publications brought in £54 more than in
1901, and £25 10s. was realised on the sale of crystals.
On the other hand, the expenses of the year have been in
some respects unusually heavy. The expenses connected with
the removal to the new rooms (including furniture) amounted
to £196. Two items of ordinary expenditure have also been
increased, namely, rent and salaries (the latter item is especially
large this year, because nearly £100 of the salaries of 1901
MAR., 1903.] Report of Council to Members and Associates. 39
is included). That, in spite of these extra expenses, the
balance at the end of the year is even larger than usual is
mainly owing to the accidental circumstance that the bills
falling due to be paid during 1902 for the printing of
Proceedings amounted to considerably less than usual.
The number of elections during the year was unusually
large; 21 new Members were elected and 6 Associates became
Members; 87 new Associates were elected, besides 12 who,
having ceased to belong, have now resumed their connection
with the Society. Against this has to be set the loss of 5
Members and 51 Associates from various causes; besides a
large number of names struck off the list of persons who had
been lost sight of, or who had for some time ceased to sub
scribe. The actual number of Members at the present date
(February, 1903) is 235, and of Associates 5871; including
36 Honorary Members and 26 Honorary Associates. The
number of Members and Associates of the American Branch
is 524.
Since the removal to Hanover Square the Library has been
reorganised and made more accessible. A complete slip cata
logue has been prepared, and nearly 1000 pamphlets and
magazine articles arranged and catalogued. A number of
periodical publications have been bound, and the current
numbers of the periodicals taken (a list of which was given
in the Journal for January) are placed on the table, and are
there available for Members and Associates, who, it is hoped,
will profit by the increased facilities and make more use of
the Library. It is open every day from 11 to 5.
The MSS. of printed and published cases have been more
completely sorted and arranged, and the whole of the un-
printed material will shortly be classified and indexed. Most
of this, however, is of little value, as the valuable cases, unless
too private, are generally printed in the Journal or Proceedings.
A register is kept of cases sent in, and the MSS. of these,
as well as of cases already printed, will continue to be stored
at the Rooms.
A considerable number of cases were, as usual, investigated
during the year, partly by the officials of the Society, partly
1 The apparent falling off in the numbers is due to greater strictness having
been exercised in sinking off the names of defaulting members from the register.
40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAK., 1903.
by Members and Associates, some of whom spent much time
and trouble in giving assistance in this work. A few of
these cases have already appeared in the Journal. The
Organising Secretary also visited three " haunted houses " in
the course of the year. In two cases nothing calling for
investigation was observed ; in the third raps were heard,
for which no physical cause was discovered, but there was
no evidence of intelligent agency. Mr. Thomas also made a
personal investigation into a case of the alleged passage of
matter through matter at Berlin. His report of this appeared
in the Journal for April, 1902.
In accordance with a decision reached in 1901, the number
of General Meetings of the Society has been reduced to three
per annum, and a series of private meetings, open to Mem
bers and Associates only, has been initiated. The attendance
of Members and Associates has been considerably larger than
in previous years ; the attendance of visitors at the General
Meetings has also been large, but since the accommodation
is limited, it has been necessary, in the interests of Members
and Associates, to restrict the number of invitations to
visitors.
Three general and three private Meetings were held during
the year. The following papers were presented :
* Jan. 29th, PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS by SIR OLIVER LODGE, F.E.S.
* May 30th, MALAY SPIRITUALISM; by MR, W. W. SKEAT.
June 20th, AUTOMATIC ROMANCE; by Miss M. BRAMSTON.
Oct. 17th, SOME RECENT EXPERIMENTS IN AUTOMATIC WRITING;
by MRS. A. W. VERRALL.
*Nov. 14th, HUMAN SENTIMENT WITH REGARD TO A FUTURE
LIFE ; by MR. F. C. S. SCHILLER.
Dec. 8th, SOME EXPERIMENTS IN HYPNOTISM ; by MR. EDWARD
GREENWOOD (pseudonym).
"These were General Meetings.
Experiments in thought-transference were carried on at
intervals throughout the year at the Rooms. The results,
while not entirely disappointing, were not decisive enough to
justify publication, at least at present. The Council wish to
thank the ladies who kindly acted as percipients in these
MAR., 1903.] Report of Council to Members and Associates. 41
experiments. They would be glad to hear of others who
would be willing to take part as percipients—especially those
who have some capacity for automatic writing or crystal
gazing. A certain number of sittings for physical phenomena
have been held at the Rooms by members of the Council and
others, at which a specially constructed stance table, kindly
presented by Colonel G. Le M. Taylor, was used.
The Rooms are available for experiments after 5 p.m.
Application for the use of them should be made to the
Organising Secretary.
The Council wish to urge the desirability of a greater
amount of co-operation between members generally, and appeal
for their more active aid. Those who have no opportunity
for experimental work may be able by systematic enquiry,
even among a restricted circle of acquaintances, to discover
spontaneous phenomena of interest. A useful field of work
is in the careful collection of well-evidenced cases of veridical
hallucinations or other impressions (especially those coinciding
with a death unknown to the percipient), and facts of much
value may be brought to light by systematic effort.
For suggestions as to the kinds of work that may be done
and methods of doing it, members may be referred to the
circular printed in the Journal for June, 1901, pp. 86-92.
Further copies of this circular may be obtained on application.
The Council would also recommend the formation of small
local groups for experiment and discussion. To facilitate this,
a list of members residing in a given area can be obtained
from the Organising Secretary.
Finally the Council would urge on members the importance
of making the work of the Society more generally known
and of securing the adhesion of new members. The recent
changes referred to above have resulted in a considerable
increase in ordinary expenditure, to meet which, as well as
to provide for the expansion of the Society's work, a continued
increase of membership is required.

ENDOWMENT FUND FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.
THE scheme for endowing a Research Scholarship in Psychical
Science announced by Sir Oliver Lodge in his Presidential
Address on January 30th is now complete, the Trust Deed
having been signed and sealed. The Trustees under the Deed
are Mr. J. G. Piddington, Sir Oliver Lodge, Mr. S. C. Scott,
Mr. F. Podmore and Mr. H. A. Smith. The fund of the trust
now amounts to £2000, and it is anticipated that it will
be increased by subscriptions and contributions by legacy or
otherwise. Both the original sum and further contributions to
it are to be invested by the Trustees at their discretion in
any stocks, funds or securities authorised by law for the invest
ment of trust funds.
The income arising from the investments will for twenty-one
years be accumulated and added to the capital, and from time
to time, as it amounts to the sum of £100, will be invested.
If after twenty-one years the trust funds do not amount to
£8000, the income will be treated as part of the ordinary
revenue of the Society.
As soon as the trust funds amount to £8000, the Council
is empowered to found a Research Scholarship, which will be
open to persons of either sex and of any nationality. Elections
to the Scholarship will be made by the Council. Every
election will be for one year only, but any holder of the
Scholarship will be eligible for re-election, and it will not
be obligatory on the Council to fill the Scholarship.
So much of the income of the Trust Fund as the Council
may from time to time direct will be paid to the then
Scholar. Any part of the income that is not required for
the purposes of the Scholarship may be applied in making
special grants for investigations made or other work done
on the Society's behalf, or be otherwise dealt with as part
of the ordinary revenue of the Society.
The chief aim of the promoters of the Fund was that
careful and prolonged experiments might be conducted by some
competent person who could give all his time to the work
without being interrupted by other business, and other work not
strictly experimental might sometimes be undertaken. Accord
MWR-, 19O3.1 Endowment Fund for Psychical Research. 45
ingly every person elected to the Scholarship will be obliged
during the tenure thereof to devote the whole or such part of
his time as the Council may require to the purposes of the
Society and to investigations on its behalf. He will be ex
pected to act generally under the direction of the Council and
to report to them from time to time. The copyright of all
reports or other writings made by him in relation to the
Society's work will be the absolute property of the Society.
Any travelling expenses incurred under the direction of the
Council and in the Society's behalf may be paid by the
Society.
The Society may at any time apply any part of the capital
of the Trust Funds that the Council may think fit towards
the establishment and fitting up of a Psychical Laboratory.
The power of appointing new Trustees will be vested in the
Council, which will also have the power generally to determine
any questions or matters of doubt arising in the execution of
the Trust. Seven clear days' notice must be given to each
member of the Council of any resolution either to vary or
revoke the conditions of the Trust or to authorise any dealing
with the capital of the Trust funds, and any such resolution,
to be valid, will require to be passed by a majority of two-
thirds of the Council then present and voting, and confirmed
by a like majority at the next meeting. The other powers
conferred on the Council by the Trust Deed may be exercised
by a resolution carried by a simple majority.
OBITUAKY.
MR. A. N. AKSAKOFF.
(June 8th, 1832—January 17th, 1903.)
"VERY few are those of whom one can say that throughout
their life they remained faithful to one idea, pursued one
aim and devoted to its realisation the whole of their energy.
Mr. Aksakoff was one of the number. From the moment
when he finished his education at the Imperial Lyceum up
to the day when, in declining age, three or four years ago,
his physical strength—though not, at first at least, his mental
46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAS., 1903.
I
vigour—was broken, he did not relinquish the task with
which he ' had identified his life and which ultimately culminated
in an attempt at a scientific demonstration of human survival.
An accidental acquaintance with Swedenborg's work on
Heaven and Hell was instrumental in showing Mr. Aksakoff"
the way from which he never again departed. Swedenborg's
doctrine made on him a lasting impression. He next began
to study A. J. Uavis's works and found in them what
seemed to him a striking confirmation of some of Swedenborg's
teachings. To the study—and translation into German and
Eussian—of both these writers Mr. Aksakoff devoted several
years. He next turned his attention to Animal Magnetism ;
but it was not till 1871 that he became personally acquainted
with " mediumistic " phenomena through the late D. D. Home.
Professor A. Boutleroff, the well-known chemist and a relation
of Mr. Aksakoff's by marriage, took part in the stances, and
was soon joined by another savant, Professor N. Wagner,
all three becoming convinced of the genuineness of the
" manifestations." As a consequence of these sittings with
D. D. Home and afterwards with Bredif, a French medium,
Professor Wagner published in the Vestnik Europy (European
Messenger) a letter proclaiming his belief in the phenomena,
which created quite a sensation.
In 1874 Mr. Aksakoff founded at Leipsic the monthly
review Psychische Studien, of which he remained Editor till
1899. In 1875, the well-known chemist, Professor Mende-
leeff, suggested that a scientific commission should be officially
appointed to investigate " the Physical Phenomena of Spiri
tualism." Mr. Aksakoff went expressly to England to
fetch mediums for the Commission—Eussian ones being
apparently inaccessible. He brought to St. Petersburg at
his own expense the Petty brothers, of Newcastle, and Mrs.
Marshall, who appeared before the Commission as " Mrs.
Clayer." The Petty mediums failed completely, whilst " Mrs.
Clayer's " phenomena left the Commission incredulous, and
the experiments soon came to an end, Mr. Aksakoff being
of opinion that the impartiality of the investigators was
not on a par with their learning.
In 1878 Mr. Aksakoff conducted a prolonged series of
experiments with the notorious " Dr." Slade, who had come
MAB., 1903.] Obituary. 47
to St. Petersburg fresh from the Zollner stances ; but the
results were chiefly negative.
In 1881 Mr. Pribitkoff, a retired officer of the Russian
Navy and now an Honorary Associate of the Society for
Psychical Research, founded a weekly paper called the Eebus,
which, little by little and labouring under many difficulties,
became the recognised organ of Russian " Spiritists " and
even—to some extent—Psychical Researchers. Great was the
aid which Mr. Aksakoff afforded from the beginning to the
new journal, both from the literary and the financial point
of view.
In 1883 Mr. Aksakoff conducted—always in St. Peters
burg—a series of experiments with Mrs. Jencken, nte Fox,
which were satisfactory to him personally, and in 1886
with Eglinton. In 1892 he took the initiative of the Milan
stances with Eusapia.
In 1885 the German philosopher Eduard von Hartmaun
published his work on Spiritism, to which Mr. Aksakoff
undertook to reply, his great work Animism and Spiritism
being the result. Surely this book is too well known to need
a word of comment or commendation on my part ! Suffice it
to say that it has become a classic for all students of the
subject.
It is more than difficult to give in this brief sketch an
adequate idea of all that Mr. Aksakoff did—both in Russia
and in Germany—in connection with Psychical Research,
and his name will always be remembered as that of one
of the greatest pioneers of this new science. As one who
knew the deceased for upwards of twelve years I may avail
myself of this opportunity to mention that he sympathised
with the work of the English Society for Psychical Research
thoroughly, and had the highest possible opinion of the
merits of such workers as the late F. W. H. Myers, Sir
Oliver Lodge, the late Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick and others.
Even the campaign—if I may be permitted to use this
term—led in 1886 and 1887 against Eglinton's slate-writing
did not repel him as it did, for instance, W. Stainton Moses.
In his review of Animism and Spintism, published in
1890 (Proceedings S.P.R, Vol. VI., p. 670) the late Mr.
Myers said he thought the list of cases, as quoted by Mr:
48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAB., 1903.
Aksakoff, " might well undergo revision." In answer to this
contention Mr. Aksakoff always maintained that he could
not vouch for every incident in particular; he was only
responsible, he said, for the class or type. Opinions may
naturally differ on this point ; but whatever may be thought
of some of Mr. Aksakoff's critical methods, all will agree
as to his learning, his lack of fanaticism—so favourably con
trasting him with many other Spiritist writers—and his
extraordinary perseverance. In collecting evidence for cases
of a supernormal character he spared no pains. In 1894
he went to Helsingfors on purpose to investigate a case of alleged
partial " dematerialisation " of the medium's body at a se'ance
of Mrs. d'Esperance's—a whole book being the result. Here
I will take the liberty to state that in my opinion the
case was not worth all the trouble Mr. Aksakoff took in
connection with it. (It should be borne in mind that he
was on particularly friendly terms with Mrs. d'Esperance and
entertained the highest regard for her " mediumship.") Mr.
Aksakoff was instrumental in saving from oblivion many
remarkable cases. Two such cases (Poltergeists) printed in
his remarkable work The Precursors of Spiritism (St. Peters
burg, 1895) were reviewed by Dr. Leaf in Proceedings S.P.R.,
Vol. XII., p. 319.
As an experimenter it is noteworthy that Mr. Aksakoff
succeeded in exposing several among the best known pro
fessional mediums. And judging by what he used to relate,
I do not think that most of his own experiments reached a
particularly high level of success. His seances with Slade
in 1878 were a source of great disappointment to him,
and the same may be said of some sittings he had with
Mrs. A. E. Fay some eleven years later. He told me him
self that his belief in " slate-writing " was based not so much
on what he had seen as on what he had read. In 1886
he conducted with Eglinton, in London, a series of photo
graphic experiments for the express purpose of disproving von
Hartmann's theory. Some years later in conversation with
me he stated that some of the results he then obtained
now seemed to him suspicious, though still believing in the
genuineness of others ; and in answer to a question from
me as to the part played by the " spirits " in this admixture
MAK., 1903.] Obituary. 49
of possible fraud and (supposed) truth—he rather vehemently
expressed as to the moral standard of the " spirits " ideas
which I was astonished to hear from him. Still he believed
in the mediumship of both Eglinton and Slade ; and his
experiments with Williams, Home, Bre"dif, Mrs. Jencken and
Eusapia—to mention no other mediums 1—gave him satis
faction.
Personally he was one of the kindliest and most sympa
thetic of men. His generosity was great and his modesty
and discretion still greater ; in this he had much of the
true grand seigneur. His services to the cause will as little
be forgotten as his memory is likely to pass away from
the recollection of those who were privileged to know him.

FAITH-HEALING.
IN the following case, though the malady was not cured by
the faith of the patient, there seems evidence that his life was
prolonged by it. The case was sent to us by the Rev. Aug.
Glardon, who wrote :
TOUR DK PEILZ, VAUD, October 12th, 1900.
This morning I went and paid a visit to a carpenter, Henry
Cornaz by name, whom I had heard to be dangerously ill with
cancer. I found him very ill indeed with a cancerous tumour in
the mouth, cheek, and nose. Our best surgeons in Lausanne told
him that it was too late for attempting an operation, and that
no remedy would avail anything.
I found him quite cheerful. He is a very good man, a kind
of mystic ; and he told me that he was sure of recovering.
" One night last week," he said, " while sleeping I heard a voice
saying : ' Be of good cheer, thou shalt recover, and still be my
witness in this and in other lands.' I awoke, full of joy ; and
having gone again to sleep, I heard the voice a second time repeat
ing the same words. Hence my confidence."
Supposing he were to recover his health, I would send you certi-
1 Some readers may be astonished not to find the late Sambor's name
mentioned in this connection. It should be mentioned that this medium did
not appear on the scene till Mr. Aksakoff's health was too much broken to-
conduct anything like a series of regular experiments.
50 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAB., 1903.
ficates of our medical men testifying both to his incurable disease
and to his having been restored to health. . . .
But I must add that, for me, I have not the slightest human
hope for him. He is about fifty years old, and the disease has
brought him down fearfully. AUG. GLARDON.
On January 13th, 1901, Mr. Glardon wrote again:
I believe [the dream occurred] about a week before my letter of
October 12th, after that the three medical men seen by Cornaz had
agreed in declaring that the disease could not be cured, and that
it was too late for an operation.
I have since been talking with one of them, Dr. E. Ceresole (son
of the late President of the Swiss Confederation). He confirmed
their verdict, and agreed to give me, when and if needed, a written
statement about Cornaz's case and a certificate of cure. He still
thinks that a cure is not possible, however, in which case his note
would not be needed.
Now, I want you to know that since the middle of November
•Cornaz has been gradually improving, although still far from being
recovered. After a few weeks in bed, with haemorrhages in the
nose and mouth, he got stronger, was enabled to rise, and finally
to go out He does now sometimes take long walks, has less
•difficulty in speaking, his face is less swollen, and the cancerous
excrescences in his mouth and nose have diminished in size.
His faith in the vision has sometimes wavered ; just now he is
very hopeful, although the doctors refuse to give him remedies,
which they deem useless. Dr. Ceresole thinks that his faith or auto
suggestion may be the cause—is probably the cause—of the improve
ment, only he adds that the improvement will be temporary.
... I shall write again on the subject, sooner or later according
to circumstances. If Cornaz were to die in his prime he would
be missed greatly in our religious circles and societies, in which he
is much liked. AUG. GLARDON.
In answer to our request for a medical history of the case
up to that date, Mr. Glardon kindly obtained for us the follow
ing statement contained in a letter from Dr. Ceresole :
VEVEY, 26 Janvier, 1901.
Je vous prie de bien vouloir m'excuser de n'avoir pas
re'pondu plus t6t a votre lettre. Je vous fais tres volontiers
la declaration que Monsieur H. Cornaz est atteint d'une affection
•tout a fait incurable ; je souhaite de tout mon coeur pour ce brave
MAK., 1903.] Faith-Healing. 51
homme que cette affirmation soit de'mentie par 1'avenir et que la
faillibilite de la science m4dicale soit une fois de plus d^montre'e.
Je ne me sens par contre pas en situation de declarer que 1'^tat
de M. Cornaz, que j'ai vu il y a une dizaine de jours, se soit
ame'liore depuis 1'automne. Au contraire la tumeur dont est atteint
M. C. a envahi les narines, inlilt IT davantage la face et se deVeloppe
aussi dans la cavitr buccole.
L'olat gem;ral reste assez bon et le sera, tant que 1'alimentation sera
encore possible. L'am^lioration que M. Cornaz croit avoir constated me
pai aft. done £tre la consequence d'une auto-suggestion, bien frequente
chez les malades. Je voudrais qu'il en fut autrement, mais je crains
bien que 1'avenir ne me donne raison. DR. E. CERESOLE.
Mr. Glardon adds (January 28th, 1901):
I forward Dr. Ceresole's note. As you will perceive, he has not
the slightest hope of an ultimate recovery. And the improvement
in Cornaz's condition is more apparent than real ; not even that.
Dr. Ceresole affirms that the tumour has expanded.
Well, Cornaz himself says that he feels much better.
I went to see him this morning, and only found his wife ; and,
in answer to my inquiries, she said :
" My husband is certainly better. The ' thing ' in the mouth has
diminished; he can eat with less difficulty, and feels much stronger.
He has just gone out for a walk, notwithstanding the wind and rain."
"Then," said I, "he still believes in a recovery?"
" Most certainly, although ready to submit to the will of God.
But, as you know, he had twice the same vision in one night, and
believes that the prediction will be realised."
Such is just now the state of things. Cornaz, whom I have met
a few days ago, looks a good deal better, and I have myself ascer
tained, de visit, that if the nostrils have been invaded, the tumour
in the mouth is two-thirds smaller. Formerly Cornaz had to keep
his mouth open, now he can and does keep it shut. He could hardly
speak, now he does speak and make himself understood easily. . . .
On March 14th, 1901, Mr. Glardon wrote: "Henry Cornaz
keeps improving wonderfully. He says so, and he looks so."
We received no more news of the case until September of
last year, when Mr. Glardon wrote :
September 9th, 1902.
My friend, the carpenter Henri Cornaz, died and was buried a
week ago, after a protracted illness and long sufferings.
52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1903.
You remember what I told you of his conviction, based on a
dream, that his illness would not prove fatal. During about six
months he remained steady in his faith ; the disease had gone back
wonderfully, he seemed in a fair way of recovery, and already the
medical men were wondering and almost shaken in their mind about
their own dark prognostics.
However, during last winter a change for the worse took place.
Cornaz began to waver in his belief; and during the last four
months of his life he gradually prepared himself to die. . . .
AUG. GLARDON.
We asked Mr. Glardon if he could obtain any further state
ments about the case from medical men who were acquainted
with it, but he replied :
I am sorry to say that I cannot give you the medical history of this
Cornaz case. Dr. Ceresole has settled in Alexandria (Egypt), and
since his departure, a few days after I sent you his account of the
case, our poor friend has applied to one quack after the other, in
compliance, I believe, with the wishes of his family. . . .
As for the improvement itself, no one around Cornaz could doubt
it, because it was very apparent, and that appearance lasted many
months. No one could certify about it better than his wife, but I
would not dream of asking her a written statement for the benefit
of the S.P.R. You have no idea how much our people are averse
to having anything to do with such things, both in the lower and
in the higher classes. AUG. GLARDON.
From an account in the Feuille de Temperance (Lausanne)
of November llth, 1902, sent to us later by Mr. Glardon, it
appears that Henri Cornaz had been a victim of the drink
habit from the age of about 19 to 37, and had consequently
brought his wife and family into great poverty. He signed
the pledge in 1882, in consequence of the representations of
a doctor as to the sufferings he was bringing on his children.
From that time he never relapsed, but became an ardent
advocate of temperance and a leading member of the Society
of the Groix-Bleue. He also more than recovered the position
which he had lost in his business.
The newspaper gives a brief account of his illness, stating
that it made much slower progress and for a long time was
much less painful than the physicians had expected. No
reference is made to the dream predicting his recovery.

MODERN SPIRITUALISM :
A HISTORY AND A CRITICISM.
BY FRANK PODMOHE.
•2 ro/*. 325 + 3^6 panes. •_'!,•. ml.
The book, whilst in form a history of the movement known as Modern
Spiritualism, which dates from the "Rochester Lappings" of 1848, is in
substance a criticism of the belief and of the foundation on which it rests.
The belief in spirit intercourse is traced back, on the one hand, through
Mesmerism and Animal Magnetism, to Alchemy ; on the other, through
Poltergeists and "electric" girls, to Witchcraft and the Hysterical
" possessions" of the Middle Ages. The author shows how the belief in
America, the land of its birth, was incubated in the trance revelations of
Andrew Jackson Davis: how it spread with epidemic rapidity through the
American continent, and reached Europe in 18f>3. Its history in this country
is given at length, and the book concludes with a detailed criticism of the
chief items of evidence relied on by modern Spiritualists and the marvt-llous
feats of Kusapia Paladino, the slate writing of Kglii ton, the experiments
made by Zollner with Slade, and by Sir W. ( rookes and others with D. D.
Home.
The author's conclusions are mainly negative, but in the clairvoyant
revelations of Mrs. Piper he fimls something still unexplained.

THE DIVINING EOD.
SINCE the publication of Professor Barrett's last Report on the
Divining Eod in Proceedings, Vol. xv., p. 130 et seq., a mass
of additional evidence has been received by him, some of
which will, we hope, be laid before the Society in future.
He sends us meanwhile the following account, which is of
more than usual interest, as coming from an educated man
who accidentally discovered that he had the power of dowsing,
and has been very successful in the practice of it.
The account comes from Major Wedderburn Maxwell, of
Glenlair, N.B., the first part being contained in a letter ad
dressed to his brother, Mr. H. Wedderburn, of Balliol College,
Oxford, which was obtained for us by the kindness of Mr.
Andrew Lang.
Glenlair, Dalbeattie, N.B., 2lst January, 1903.
I knew nothing about water-finding until Mr. Houston came
here—at my request—on Wednesday, 9th July, 1902—to show me
how he found water, and to try and find a fresh supply for Charteris,
the joiner, who had set the sanitary inspector at me, as his land
lord, as the water supply at Bankend had run short on account of
the great drouth last spring. Mr. Houston came over from Bar-
whillanty, and brought six twigs of different trees cut out of a
hedge, and a twisted wire. In showing me, in my study, how the
twigs and wire worked on metal, he discovered that I also had the
same power as himself. We went outside after lunch and found
water near the house in several places, both where it was known
to exist, and where it was not known to exist. We then drove
over to Bankend, and again tried for water, and we got a splendid
spring of first-class water at the bottom of Mr. Charteris's garden.
Mr. Houston stated that the water could be got at 5 feet from the
surface. A well was dug, and I measured it. It is 6 feet deep,
and the water was standing 14 inches below the surface level of
the ground. Charteris says the water is first-class drinking water.
We also traced the source of this water in a zig-zag direction from
above where the well was sunk.
When it was known through the district that I also had the
same power with a twig or wire as Mr. Houston, John Cunning
ham asked me to go over to Tarbreoch to try and find water near
the farm house, as their water supply had failed, and he had a
1903. The Divining Rod. 87
scheme of getting water from a distance, which would be a costly
one to carry out. I went over to Tarbreoch with the twisted wire
I had got from Mr. Houston, and I tried in the field just above
the farm house for water. Very soon the wire began to work, and
twisted straight down in my hand, indicating a strong supply of
water not far off. I told Cunningham to mark the spot, and dig
there. Cunningham turned over a sheep trough to mark the spot,
and we then went and tried other places round the farm steading. I
found good supplies of water in five or six places, which were
marked. John Cunningham got a man from Kirkpatrick-Durham to
•dig, and set him to work at the spot marked by the upturned
sheep trough. When the workman had dug down 17 feet, he
came on a very plentiful supply of water, which has now risen to
within 4 or 5 feet of the surface.
As water was not known to exist when I indicated this spot
to John Cunningham (it was on the brow of a slope in a green
grass field), I fail to understand how this can be ascribed to
"conscious knavery, or to a more or less unconscious delusion."
I had no idea till the wire began to be drawn in my hands towards
the spot, and then to twist violently and go straight down, that
there was water ; but now I can, from practice, blindfolded, and
pushed from behind by any one, go about till the wire tells me
water is near, and then I can find the spot by attraction. I've
done this blindfolded in several places—Shoeburyness, Ashbourne,
Hartlip, Llandrindod Wells, etc. The wires also can tell me that
water is running under a house when you are standing one and
sometimes two storeys above the ground.
I can find water with forked twigs of the following wood :
Willow, hazel, common ash, weeping ash, mountain ash (rowan),
whitethorn, blackthorn, holly, laburnum, laurel, and apple. I dare
say there are many other kinds of wood that would do as well, that
I have not tried yet, and it appears to me that almost any forked
twig that is full of sap will do for the purpose of a divining rod.
I never had any interest in water-finding till the sanitary inspec
tor started on me with the threat of setting the County Council
At me to get a water supply for Charteris at Bankend, and though
I stormed pretty freely at the time, it has turned out a wind that
blew me some good, for now I can find water where it exists, and
I find I can add materially to the present water supply to this
house from springs close to the cistern at Paddock Hall, at present
.untapped.
88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNB, 1903.
I have found some people who have the power much stronger
than I have. One man of 82, whom I met at Llandrindod Wells,
had this power quite as thoroughly as it lies in myself. My son,
Johnny, aged eight on 20th July, 1902, has the power, but none
of the rest of the children have it so far. Dorothy can't get either
a twig or a wire to work, and she was ten years old on 20th
August last.
I have taken hold of people by one hand and made them hold
the wires or twigs in their left hand and held the other end in my
right hand, and the wires or twigs will work and twist despite
what any one does or wishes to do to prevent it.
It is quite a simple matter to take a dozen pairs of gloves be
longing to twelve different people, lay them at intervals apart,
having taken one glove out of any pair, and then blindfolded to
go—guided by some one—over every pair till the wire comes over
the fellow of the glove you hold in your hand, when the wire will
at once twist and go down to the mate of the glove in your
hand.
There is no doubt that after using these twigs or wires trying
to find water, etc., one gets very much exhausted. I have been
taken blindfolded over pipes and taps of water where water was
—and was known to be by people to test me—and I could not pos
sibly see these taps or pipes—and the wire has always worked
accurately. I've also made sceptics hold one end of the wire or
twig, while I held their right hand in my left, and the other end
of the wire or twig in my right hand to complete the circle, and
the wire or twig will work despite all tbe sceptic can do to
prevent it.
The only place I have ever known the wires or twigs refuse to
work was at Norton Hill, Runcorn, Cheshire, where the atmosphere is
full of chemicals from the Chemical Works at Widnes, in Cheshire,
and where the upper limbs of all the big trees are destroyed, and
the grass is blackened with the chemical soot from the Widnea
Works for miles around. ... I have gone out of a room and
found a sovereign hidden in the room in my absence, and being
blindfolded before I was brought into the room—also a hidden
glove, while holding the other glove of the pair in my hand.
When I hold the wires and am in the vicinity of water, or coal,
or metals, one feels the magnetic current strong. I saw the bark
twisted off a forked willow held by Tait, the late gardener here,
when he tried over a place where I had found water with the wires

before him. I've seen two twigs I cut break with a snap in the
hands of Colonel Paget, to whom I gave them when at Llandrindod
Wells last year, and my bauds have been made quite sore by the
wires and twigs twisting in them over water.
JAS. WKDDKRBURN MAXWELL.
With regard to his experience of water-finding, Major Max
well writes later to Professor Barrett :
March 13HA, 1903.
When I was asked by John Cunningham to go to Tarbreoch to
see if there was any water near the farm, I went there ignorant
of any geological knowledge or hydro-geological knowledge ; I trusted
entirely to the wires in my hands acting to show me indications
of water. The field where the water was indicated was green
all over with grass, and there were no indications of surface water
to be seen, such as the grass growing with greater luxuriance in
one spot than in another. My sole reason for stating that a good
supply of water would be found at the spot where the well was
dug, and the water found, was the strong force which the rod
suddenly exhibited by twisting in my hands in spite of my trying
to prevent it.
Writing again on May 23rd, 1903, Major Maxwell informs
us that he has had three more places dug for water where
the divining wires indicated its existence to him and that
water was found in each case.
The following extracts from letters from Major Maxwell
to Sir Oliver Lodge give further particulars of the finding of
objects through the divining rod,—evidently by means of muscle-
reading, as in the so-called " willing game,"—and of experiments
designed to test what conditions, if any, interfere with the
motion of the rod.
The glove experiment I have to-day shown to my sister, who
blindfolded me in one room, and took me into the next where she
had placed two pairs of my gloves, and one glove of her own—
giving me the fellow to hold in my hand with the wires, and
I satisfied her of the accuracy of the wires in finding the
fellow to the glove in my hand which belonged to her, while
the wires did not act when she took me over my own two
pairs of gloves—placed in separate parts of the room.
It is just as easy to find a gold watch hidden in a room—
90 Journal of Society fw Psychical Research. JUNK, 1903,
when brought blindfolded into the room, holding a piece of gold
in one hand in which the end of the wire is held—as it is to
find a glove when one holds its fellow in one hand. These ex
periments I have tried successfully—but one must not try them
where water or metal pipes exist under the floor or surface, as
the wire will work to the water or metal pipe as well.
You ask "whether the interposition of gloves makes any difference."
It makes no difference whatever. I find that when I put on a
pair of kid or dog-skin gloves, the wires work just the same as
in my naked hands.
I take the divining rod and search for water ; suddenly I feel
a sensation from the wire that I am near water, or metal, or
coal. I go in the direction indicated by the divining rod till it
suddenly goes straight down vertically in my hands ; I then turn
my back on this spot and walk slowly from it, till the wire
or divining rod ceases to act at all.
This is the way that water diviners can estimate the depth
below the surface of the water, or metal, and, with some, it is
one foot deep for every yard measured from the spot indicated by
the divining rod [as one where] water exists to where the rod ceases
to attract or work. I have not had an opportunity of testing
accurately for myself this means of calculating the depth of water.
If one is not in good health, the divining rod does not work
with the same power as when one is well and fit. I have found
this to be the case myself.
Let me tell you another experiment I tried last year. I
cut a divining rod off a wych elm, and then whittled off the
twigs and leaves before using this rod. I then tried it over a
sulphur spring, when it worked perfectly. Then I tried for a place
where no water existed and where this twig would not work on
anything else. On finding this place I took the leaves and twigs,
which I had whittled off the wych elm rod and put them in
a heap, and went off about fifteen or sixteen yards and took the
wych elm rod in my hands and approached the spot where the
leaves and twigs were lying. As soon as I got within about a
yard of the leaves and twigs, the rod in my hand indicated their
presence and went down vertically at once. This is on the same
principle as finding one glove with the divining rod and its fellow
glove in your hand, or finding a gold watch or a sovereign with
a piece of gold and the divining rod in your hand. The other day
I was blindfolded here (at Bath) on a landing outside a drawing
JOKE, 1903. The Divining Rod. 91
room. A lady had a piece of coal in her lap and sat in one of
the chairs in the drawing room. I was then led into the room
and brought over where she was sitting. The wire immediately
twisted in my hand and went down vertically. I was then led
about in the room blind-folded and in the meanwhile this lady
had slipped into another chair and then I was led up to where
she was sitting and the wire immediately went down again.
The handkerchief was then removed and below the wire was the
coal in the lady's lap !
I have just tried a " divining rod " made of copper wire over
a small decanter of whisky. The decanter had the stopper (of cut
glass) in it. I slipped a pair of woollen mittens over the shafts
of the wire so that my naked skin did not touch the wire. The
wire acted at once and went straight down on the top of the
decanter. This shows that wool will not prevent the wire work
ing. Of course you can't prevent a wire working with the woollen
mittens round the shafts so easily as with the naked hand.
Continuing my letter re interposition of gloves, etc., between the
naked hand and the divining wires, I tried the following experiment.
Taking two sets of divining wires made of ordinary galvanised iron
wire, I whipped them together with string so that the naked hand
did not touch the wires, and then tried to see if it made any
difference to the wires working. It made no difference whatever.
I then put on a pair of gloves and held the wires where the
strings had been whipped round them and the wires just worked
the same as ever.
I don't know whether you have ever heard that the position of
the roots of a tree under ground can be ascertained by means
of these divining wires—but this also can be done. First go
round the tree at a distance from the bole and see that there
is no water running under it. Then take a leaf, or end of a
twig, off one of the branches of the tree and hold it with the
divining rod and again walk round the tree and the rod will
indicate where the roots exist.
I showed the following experiment this afternoon to Colonel
and Mrs. R n H n and Mr. C e, of S r. I took
four primroses out of a bowl and laid them on the table separately.
I passed the divining rod over them and it took no notice of
the primroses. I then picked up one of the primroses and held
it in my baud with the divining rod and passed the rod over
each of the other three primroses, when the divining rod immediately
92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1903.
went down over each separate primrose. Then I took two snowdrops
out of the bowl and placed them between the primroses. I again
passed the rod holding a primrose in my hand over the three primroses
and the two snowdrops. The divining rod would not move when
over the snowdrops, but went down as before over each primrose.
I then put down the primrose in my hand on the table and
took another snowdrop out of the bowl and holding it in my
hand passed the divining rod over the four primroses and two
snowdrops on the table. The rod worked at once when over the
snowdrops, but would not move when over the primroses.
These experiments bear out, in a very striking manner,
various conclusions arrived at by Professor Barrett in his
reports on the subject. That the rod should work equally
well and in a similar manner with so great a variety of
objects,—water, metals, coal, tree-roots, flowers, articles of
wearing apparel,—etc., shows almost conclusively that it cannot
depend on any physical influence or material attraction of
one object for another, since it is hardly conceivable that,
say, a primrose should affect the rod or not according to
whether another primrose is or is not held in the hand with
the rod. On the other hand, all the results of Major Max
well's experiments can be easily and simply explained by
Professor Barrett's theory that the rod is worked by mental
action,—that is, by the ideas, subconscious or conscious, of
the operator, causing an unconscious and involuntary action
of his muscles, and perhaps revealing themselves only by this
means, as the subliminal ideas of the crystal gazer are revealed
by his crystal visions.
In both cases these ideas may be veridical, as when the
rod turns over actual underground water, the existence of
which was unknown to the operator, or when the crystal-
vision represents actual events occurring at a distance ; or
the ideas may be merely subjective in origin, as when the
rod turns in the absence of water, or the crystal-vision
reproduces the conscious thoughts of the seer. The mere fact
of the rod turning does not, of course, prove the presence
of water, or of whatever object is being sought for, as some
dowsers are apt to think, any more than the fact of a vision
being seen in the crystal proves that its counterpart exists
in the world.
JUNK, 1903. The Divining Rod. 93
The turning of Major Maxwell's rods over flowers, etc.,
seems to be due to expectancy—perhaps unconscious in the
first instance—on his part, arising from his theory that the
action is one of attraction of like objects for like. That this
is the most probable explanation is shown by the fact that
the effect failed to be produced when he was neither aware
of the real circumstances nor in contact with a person
who knew of them, as in a case which he describes as
follows :
March 1th, 1903.
Last night my wife placed seven cards of one pack face down
wards on a table. One of these cards was the ace of spades. The
seven cards had been shuffled so that neither my wife nor our
governess nor I knew which was the ace of spades. Taking the
ace of spades of another pack in my hand, with a wire, I passed
the wire over each of the seven cards that were face downwards.
The wire acted equally on each of the seven cards.
It is always difficult for the automatist to believe that his
automatic actions are performed by his own muscles, since
the sensations accompanying them are different from those
accompanying voluntary conscious muscular action. He may
often, in fact, have the sensation of resisting what he is actu
ally accomplishing, and this sensation may not be altogether
an imaginary one. That is, he may be consciously trying to
do one thing (to resist the motion of the rod) while he is
unconsciously trying harder to do something else (to move it),
and in that case he would probably be aware only of the
sensations accompanying the conscious effort.
These questions are fully discussed by Professor Barrett.
He brings forward in his first Keport ample evidence to
show that the movement of the rod is due to unconscious
muscular action, and further that it depends on the fixed,
but often subconscious ideas of the dowser (see especially
Proceedings, Vol. xill., pp. 243-248). He returns to the
subject in his second Report, and here he quotes an inter
esting observation by Dr. Purser as to the movements by
which the rod is turned, as seen in the case of an amateur
dowser, Mr. J. H. Jones (see Proceedings, Vol. xv., p. 288).
Dr. Purser observed that the movements consisted in a
9-i Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JCNK, 1903.
rotation of the fore-arms, or one of them, and a flexion of
the inner fingers, and Professor Barrett continues :
The breaking of the forked twig can only be accomplished by a
rigid grasp of one of the forks, and a rotation of the twig by the
hand holding the other fork. This is probably what occurs—the
skill and strength required to do this, without much visible motion
of the hand, being as much beyond the conscious effort of the
dowser as the feats of a somnambulist or hypnotised person are
beyond the power of the same person in his normal state ; and the
physiological explanation is probably much the same in the two
cases, namely, an automatic concentration and discharge of most
of the available nervous energy of the individual into one narrow
channel. Only a trained anatomist is competent to give an opinion
on this question, for he knows which muscles to observe, whilst the
startling effects of auto-suggestion are well known to physiologists.
Another problem connected with the motion of the rod
which has been noticed by Major Maxwell and other dowsers
is the curious fact that when the dowser holds the wrist or
hand of a person with whom alone the rod will not turn, it
often begins to move. Numerous instances of this are given
in Professor Barrett's reports, and he observes of them (op.
cit. p. 293):
There can, therefore, be no doubt about this curious fact, which
seems to occur most conspicuously only with notable dowsers such
as Bleton and the late J. Mullins. What is the explanation of it ?
I expect it will be found not in the transmission of any voluntary
or involuntary motion from the sensitive to the insensitive person
but in the transmission of a suggestion to the latter. If so, any
mode of impressing such a suggestion would do as well if it be
emphatic and indirect. The charming away of warts, of which we
have such striking and well authenticated instances, is a case where
any kind of indirect suggestion will do if it be strongly impressed
on the recipient.
This view seems to be confirmed by the following observa
tion of Major Maxwell's :
I find now that one does not even require to hold a person's
hand for the wires to work. By touching part of their clothes or
holding a part of their dress in one's- hand, the wire works as
soon as the circuit is complete.
1903. Automatic Drawings of Mrs. Watts. 95
THE AUTOMATIC DRAWINGS OF MRS. WATTS.
THOSE members who were present at the meeting of the
Society on March 13th will remember the striking series of
automatic drawings by Mrs. Alaric Watts (Anna Mary
Howitt) exhibited by Mr. Douglas Murray, of which there
was not time at the meeting to give an account.
The most authentic account of the development of Mrs.
Watts' power and of the process by which the drawings
were produced is to be found in two articles by herself and
her husband published in Light for April 13th and April
27th, 1889 (Vol. ix., p. 176 and p. 203), of which the
following is a brief summary.
It must be premised that Mrs. Watts—living at a time
when almost nothing was known of the subject of auto
matism :—was herself convinced that both the visions she
saw and the drawings she made were to be attributed to
spiritual agency. It does not appear, however, that they ever
represented in an unmistakable manner any real event or
fact unknown to her—the subjects being mostly religious, or
symbolic figures representing faith, charity, etc.—and generally
surrounded with or forming part of highly decorative designs.
She states that after practising automatic writing for
some time and then trying to check it, the power changed
from the writing of letters and words into the delineation
of forms. The first stage consisted in seeing " visions "—
which do not appear to have been at all fully externalised,
bat were probably of the nature of hypnagogic hallucinations,
seen sometimes with closed eyes, and often on waking
suddenly. The visions represented human figures in out
lines of white or grey upon a darker background, upon
which they stood out as if sculptured in relief. The ex
planation of each figure or group was given in white or
grey lines of writing inscribed above or below them or on
scrolls held in their hands or on their shields, swords or
garments, or on a label proceeding from their lips. Three
visions are specially described : one was of the New Jerusalem
represented as a majestic woman clothed in wonderful
1 Her description was written in 1875, and she states that it was then
more than 20 years since her power had first developed.
96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1903.
draperies, studded with jewels, and wearing many crowns
and a singular breastplate ; another was of an expiring Titan,
representing the end of the world ; the third was of the Last
Judgment, a strong celestial woman hurling down into the
abyss a Titanic man who fell smitten by the Word of
Truth which proceeded from her mouth.
Mrs. Watts goes on to describe her endeavours to ignore
and escape from the thought of these visions by occupying
herself with other things, especially in drawing studies of
flowers, etc., in which it appears that she was an adept.
She was, in fact, an accomplished artist in general. One
•day while sketching some irises she paused to talk to a
friend with her hand resting on a sheet of paper. Soon
she felt the pencil move as if of itself and begin to draw.
It drew a small initial letter with a female head attached.
She then remembered that the names of three artists—Fra
Angelico, Raphael and Blake—used often to appear in her
automatic writing ; and sometimes while she was painting
in a normal manner, these names would be written in paint
on her palette, and the writing had said that the spirits of
these and other painters would come to assist in the art of
the future. As she was thinking of this the pencil drew
the interlinked initials, A.R.B.
After this incident she made systematic attempts to develop
the power of drawing automatically,—regarding it as a kind
of exercise through which religious and philosophical truths were
conveyed symbolically to her mind. Every day for about an
hour she sat alone in a retired part of her friend's garden with
pencil and paper, and waited to see what would come. The
first drawings produced were crude and childish—resembling
groups of figures from the earliest Byzantine, German and
Italian artists, often accompanied with writing and sometimes
like a sort of missal-page of Byzantine type. These show a
good deal of imagination, though—as continued to be the case
throughout—the same forms and figures or types of figure con
stantly recur. As far as execution went, they were at first
much inferior to her normal drawings, but gradually improved
up to a very high standard of artistic excellence.
She found for some time that the design would constantly
change and develop during the process of drawing, so as to
JUNK, 1903. Automatic Drawings of Mrs. Watts. 97
produce an unfinished and complicated effect, as if several
designs were mixed together in one picture ; till she hit on
the plan of tracing off whatever part of the outline seemed
complete, and starting next time from that point instead
of beginning afresh. In many cases automatic writing was
associated with the drawing, the writings being explanatory
of the drawings. She also painted automatically, having the
colours prepared on her palette, and letting her hand be-
" guided " to select them in turn.
Like most automatists, she found that the power varied
a good deal at different times and under different circum
stances — some conditions, such as bad weather or the
interruption of certain visitors, appearing especially adverse—
or again the power might cease, as if simply exhausted and
for no other apparent reason.
In the later years of her life it became more and more
precarious and liable to be interrupted by adverse conditions
and with less and less strong apparent impulse to manifest
itself. Mrs. Watts then occupied herself chiefly in writing
on the religious and philosophical aspects of spiritualism, and
the faculty of internal visualisation became more highly
developed, seeming to a great extent to take the place of
the faculty of automatic drawing. Mr. Myers has shown
how closely akin are the two forms of automatism—sensory
and motor—and we often find the same person able, e.g., to
see visions in crystals (which it seems very likely that Mrs.
Watts might have done if she had tried the experiment)-
and to write automatically.
CASES OF SUBLIMINAL MEMOEY IN DEEAMS.
(I.) THE case which follows is the personal experience of an
Associate and frequent contributor to the Journal, who prefers on
this occasion to remain anonymous, for reasons which will, we
think, be obvious.
The full names and addresses of the persons concerned are
known to us.
Miss M writes under the date of May 12th, 1902:
I was staying from the 20th of last March until Tuesday the
1st of April, at a place where I have been frequently and for
98 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JOSE, 1903.
many years, called by my official inspections, and with which,
therefore, I am well acquainted. My recent stay there included
two Sundays, Palm Sunday, the 23rd, and Easter Sunday, the 30th
of March, on both of which days I went to services at the Parish
Church as usual. On the night of Monday, the 31st, I had a
ridiculous dream. I thought I was standing among a row of others
in a front pew, next to a lady who was my governess when a
child, and whom I have not seen for some years, nor has anything
recalled her specially to my mind.
My governess was behaving in a very unsuitable manner, for she
continued to talk and laugh aloud, in spite of my efforts to stop her.
Thereupon, the Vicar, who was standing in the reading desk immedi
ately in front of us, stepped out of it in a very angry and rude
manner, and came up to me, apparently with the intention of push
ing or striking me ; but I looked him up and down with such severity
that he contented himself with touching me with one finger. He
then turned his attentions to my governess, and slapped her vigorously
with a black glove which he held in his hand. Next day, Tuesday,
the 1st of April, I was discussing the Easter services with a lady
who has been for many years a resident in the place, and I told
her of my absurd dream. She then said how curious it was that
the Vicar should persist in wearing gloves in church, and told me
that he always, at every service without exception, wore a glove on
one hand, carrying the other ; it had been a subject of annoyance
to his congregation ever since he had been there.
Now, it may seem strange that I had never myself noticed
this, often as I have been to the church. But I am not in the
habit of looking at the clergyman in church, and at this place I
generally sit quite at the further end. I cannot remember, even
now, ever having seen the gloves, or heard any one speaking of
them, and I was altogether surprised at hearing that the clergyman
wore them. I suppose I must have seen them unconsciously, and
that my sub-conscious knowledge came out in my dream.
The lady to whom Miss M narrated her dream,
writes on May 13th, 1902, as follows:
I remember Miss M telling me on Tuesday, the 1st of
April, of her dream the night before. I told her of the Vicar's
habit of wearing gloves as she has described, and she told me that
she had never noticed his doing so. It was quite a surprise to her.
I have read her statement, which is quite correct.
JOKE, 1903. Cases of Subliminal Memory in Dreams. 99
(II.) The following is another case which may probably be
referred to subliminal memory of an incident that passed
unnoticed by the supraliminal self ; that is, the servant
herself may in an absent-minded fit have put the cream jug
in or near the place where she afterwards found it ; if so,
her complete forgetfulness of the place suggests that she had
never been supraliminally aware of it at all.
The account comes from an Associate of the Society, and
was written, it will be observed, immediately after the
event. Miss Marten writes :
78, VANBRUGH PARK, BLACKHEATH, S.E., Jan. 7th, 1903.
I send yon an account of an incident which has just taken
place in my household.
I have a silver cream jug which I value very much, as it
belonged to my great-grandmother ; on Christmas Day it was
missing. It had been used the Sunday before, and the housemaid in
whose charge it was thought she had put it away as usual in a
closet at the top of the house. She and her fellow - servant
hunted for it without success. I have had one servant five years,
the other more than one ; they are both perfectly honest and
respectable.
This morning the housemaid came in excited to my friend,
Fraulein Miiller, saying she had found the jug. She told me after
wards the same story which she told Fraulein Miiller, that she
dreamed in the night some one told her it was on a certain box.
This box, a black portmanteau, stands on the landing with others,
near the closet where the silver is kept. The dream made such an
impression on her that she went to look, and on moving the boxes
found the jug fallen down by this special black portmanteau.
I enclose Fraulein Miiller's account and the servant's as it was
taken down from her dictation. A. R. MARTEN.
Miss Miiller gives the following statement :
Jan. 1th, 1903.
Miss Marten has asked me to put down the following account :
This morning, when I was sitting in the dining-room, I heard some
body coming running downstairs, the door opened and Lizzie rushed
in, beaming all over her face, high up in her hand carrying the jug.
" Here it is, I found it, and just there where I was told to find
it. I dreamt of it." And then she told of a box, and room, and
dream, all so quickly, and all the time laughing between the
116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1903.
occasion (against the two other occasions noted by Mr. B.),
" also in the winter," when the figure appeared outside the
front door, and in describing the experience says, " she looked
so hard," " we looked very hard at one another," " she was
a young woman, very lovely, about 18 to 20 years of age."
Apparently the two appearances outside the front door have
become merged into one composite memory ; but it may
be noted that whereas in the earlier record it was specifically
denied that the face was seen on any one of the three
occasions, Mrs. P. thinks 17 years later that she saw the
face of the apparition once at least.1 This, however, is but a
very slight addition to the essential part of the narrative.
Against it may be set as examples of the minimising ten
dency, T.'s denial in 1902 of the story of the shadow of an
old man in his bedroom, and the less dramatic version given
in 1902 by Mrs. C. of the behaviour of a dog. In 1885
the " dog rushed downstairs pluckily enough, but only to
return immediately in a state of the most abject terror."
In 1902, "Rex barked very much, but would not leave the
bed, and the large dog we could not move at all, he just
lay [under the bed], and nothing would make him come
out."
'On the other hand, the almost contemporaneous second-hand account of
Mr. B. insists on the marked likeness of the apparition to the seer, a detail
which is entirely absent from Mrs. P.'s own narrative, and which seems to
have been read into the experience by Mr. B. himself.

MODERN SPIRITUALISM :
A HISTORY AND A CRITICISM.
BT FRANK PODMORE.
2 vols. 325 + 386 pages. 21«. net.
The book, whilst in form a history of the movement known as Modern
Spiritualism, which dates from the "Rochester Rappings" of 1848, is iu
substance a criticism of the belief and of the foundation on which it rests.
The belief in spirit intercourse is traced back, on the one hand, through
Mesmerism and Animal Magnetism, to Alchemy ; on the other, through
Poltergeists and " electric " girls, to Witchcraft and the Hysterical
" possessions " of the Middle Ages. The author shows how the belief in
America, the land of its birth, was incubated in the trance revelations of
Andrew Jackson Davis : how it spread with epidemic rapidity through the
American continent, and reached Europe in 1853. Its history in this country-
is given at length, and the book concludes with a detailed criticism of the
chief items of evidence relied on by modern Spiritualists and the marvellous
feats of Eusapia Paladino, the slate writing of Egliuton, the experiments
made by Zollner with Slade, and by Sir W. Crookes and others with D. D.
Home.
The author's conclusions are mainly negative, but in the clairvoyant
revelations of Mrs. Piper he finds something still unexplained.

CASES.
G. 273. Dream.
THE following is a case of the finding of a corpse through
information given in a dream. We have printed several
cases of this type—some of them much stronger evidentially
than this one—but we print this because we were able to
have it very thoroughly investigated within a fortnight of
its occurrence, so that the information we have about it is
unusually complete and reliable. Our attention was first
drawn to the case through a newspaper cutting, probably
dated April 18th, 1903, as follows:
Two men lost their lives in the Severn at Bewdley on March
22, and it was not until Wednesday that the first body—that
of Stephen Price—was found. At the inquest yesterday afternoon
at Stourport, Thomas Butler, who found the body, said it was
owing to a dream the night before that he visited the spot where
he found the body. It was six miles from the scene of the
fatality. A verdict of " Accidentally drowned " was returned, the
coroner remarking on the curious circumstance of the dream.
Lieutenant-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor, who undertook
the investigation, writes as follows :
April 25th, 1903.
Starting with the above information, and on consulting a map,
I found that Kidderminster was the nearest town in which I might
hope to find a local newspaper giving further information about
the case.
I went to Kidderminster yesterday morning, and found that
three local papers are published in that town, namely, The Shuttle,
The News, and The Times. They all rely, as far as the above case
is concerned, on the same source of information (a reporter on the
staff of the News, I believe), and seemingly simply copy the one
from the other.
I looked over the back numbers of the News, and found the
following information : [The first cutting sent by Colonel Taylor,
dated March 26th, 1903, gives an account of the drowning of the
two men on Sunday evening, March 22nd, Price having fallen into
the river by accident, and Edgington, a relief signalman on the
OCT., 1903. Cases. 119
Great Western Railway, having gone in to rescue him. Both
bodies were carried away and disappeared. The other cuttings
report the finding of Price's body, and the inquest.]
I then went to the office of the Shuttle, from which I obtained
the following two cuttings :
[From The Kidderminster Shuttle, April 18th.]
" On Sunday evening, March 22nd, Stephen Price, an under-
coachman at The Heath, Wribbenhall, whose parents reside at Love
Lane, Stonrbridge, and a young married man, Henry Edgington,
a signalman at the Bewdley Railway Station, were drowned in the
river Severn at Bewdley. The river was in flood at the time. The
sad affair occurred in the darkness of the evening, and all attempts
to recover the bodies were fruitless. A reward was offered for the
finding of each body. Diligent search was made along the course
of the stream, but nothing was found until Wednesday, when it
was stated in Stourport that the body of a man had been seen in
the river just below the Lincombe weir. The body was got out of
the water, removed to the Stourport mortuary, and in the after
noon was identified by Mrs. Millward, of Wribbenhall, as that of
Stephen Price. The coroner was informed of the circumstances,
and an inquest on the body was held at Stourport this (Friday)
afternoon."
[From The Kidderminster Shuttle, April 25th.]
" As briefly stated in the Shuttle last week, an inquest was held
on Friday afternoon at the Town Hall, Stourport, before Mr.
Hughes, coroner for the district, on the body of Stephen Price,
aged 17 years, of Wribbenhall, groom to Mr. Edward Smith, J.P.,
of The Heath, Wribbenhall, who was drowned in the river Severn
at Bewdley on Sunday evening, March 22nd, and whose body was
found on Wednesday morning just below Lincombe Weir, Stourport.
" Mrs. Millward, of Wribbenhall, said the deceased had lodged
at her house for some time. He was employed at The Heath,
Wribbenhall, the residence of Mr. Edward Smith, J.P. He was a
very quiet and steady young man. She saw him last alone on the
Sunday evening, March 22nd, when he returned from The Heath.
He said, ' I am too late for church to-night,' and went into the
garden. He was in good spirits. She heard the next morning that
he had fallen into the river, and had seen the body at Stourport
mortuary on Wednesday afternoon.
" Mrs. Preece, of Severn-side North, Bewdley, said she had seen
the young man as an attendant at Mr. Smith's class. On the
120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1903.
Sunday evening she was standing at the door of the entry
leading to her cottage when she saw Price walking along the quay
very near the edge of the river. He was singing a church hymn.
He was alone, and quite suddenly he disappeared. The river was
bank high at the time. She heard a splash of water, and thought
that the young man had fallen in. She saw a man coming along
the quay, and she told him that a young man had just fallen into
the river. The man ran to the public-house, and in a moment a
number of men were on the quay. The current was very strong,
and carried the body under one of the large boats. She saw Price
when in the water throw up his hands, and then he totally dis
appeared. An attempt was made to find the body, but it was
fruitless. Price was near the landing steps when he fell into the
water.
"Thomas Butler, of Bell-row, Stourport, labourer, said on Wed
nesday morning he went towards Shrawley Wood. On the previous
evening he dreamt that he saw the body of a man on the top side
of the Lincombe Weir. He went for a walk with a man, and told
him that he had had the dream. They went round Shrawley
Wood and returned by Hampstall Hotel, and when just below
Lincombe Weir he saw the body of a man in the water in the
weir cutting. He got a boat and called to John Oakley, clerk at
the Lincombe Lock, who said that a policeman was at the lock-
house. Witness rowed the boat across the river, picked up P.O.
Monks, and took him to the spot where the body was. They put
the body into the boat, and it was conveyed to the mortuary.
"The Coroner—Are you in the habit of having these realistic
dreams ?
" Witness—No, sir.
" The Coroner—You might be a useful man if you were.
" Witness—Very likely, sir.
" P.C. Meaks, stationed on Hartlebury Common, also gave evidence
of the recovery of the body. He thought that the body was held
in the upright position in which it was found by the large rocks
in the weir. He had been to the Lincombe Lock daily since the
two men were missing from Bewdley, and had made inquiries.
There were a few scars about the body, which had no doubt been
occasioned by the body rolling over the weir rocks. In the clothing
he found a hymn book and a card.
" The Coroner said the dream which Butler said he had on the
Tuesday evening was a very remarkable thing. The young man
OCT., 1903. Cases. 121
seemed to have been a well-conducted and well-behaved person,
and it was evident that he had nothing on his mind which would
lead him to get into the water.
"The jury at once returned a verdict of 'Accidentally drowned.'"
After lunch I went to Stourport and walking down to the river
hired a boat and a man to row me down to Lincombe Weir. The
man from whom I hired the boat, speaking of the case (about
which everybody seems to be interested), told me that Butler had
been down river about a job with timber and on his way home
with some young man differed with him about the way they should
return, Butler insisting on following the river because he had
dreamed that one of the bodies, for which a reward of one pound
was offered, was somewhere near Lincombe Weir. He also told me
that there was a man at the Weir named King who most likely
knew -where Butler was to be found, and who had been a river-
man all his life.
On arrival at the Weir I found Frederick King, the man referred
to, who showed me the place where the body was found, a place
which in his opinion, he said, was a most unlikely place for it to be.
He described how the body [was found,] close to, or caught by a
bush (which I saw) protruding out of the water, buried up to the
knees in the sand and leaning over so that one hand was also
buried—something like this, I fancy [sketch enclosed].
In reply to questions from me he said that if he was looking
for a corpse in the river between Bewdley and the Weir, there
were three places he might expect to find it in addition to the
slack water above the Weir. He also told me that "The Lord
Nelson" at Stourport was Butler's "house of call," and that it was
kept by Ward. George Eichards was the man with Butler
when he found the body which he (King) assisted to get out
of the water, and that Butler's address was Bell's BuildingSi
Stourport.
A is where the body was found [about 200 yards below the weir
in sketch enclosed] and B is, as far as I could make out, where
Butler dreamed it was [viz. about 100 yards above the weir].
On my return to Stourport I soon found the " Lord Nelson," and
on speaking to Ward about Butler's dream he told me the same
story I had heard several times before. I asked if Butler had
related his dream before finding the body. " Oh, yes," he answered,
"he told me and several people in the morning before he found it,
and declared his intention of looking about Lincombe on account
122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1903.
of it." Asked to relate as nearly as possible what the story was,
he said : " Butler told us he had had a dream in the night that he
saw a body caught in a bush below Lincombe Weir and felt sure it
was one of them two drowned at Bewdley." Mr. Ward kindly
said he would find Butler if I came back at 6 o'clock.
At 6 o'clock I again found myself at the " Lord Nelson " where
I saw Mrs. and Miss Ward, each of whom assured me that she had
heard [Butler] relate his dream before he found Price, but, more
accurate than Mr. Ward, said that it was above the Weir that
Butler dreamed he saw the man.
In a few minutes Mr. Ward appeared and told me Butler was ill,
but he would show me where he lived.
I saw Butler in his house (he is down with influenza) ; he stated
to me that last Wednesday week (the 15th inst.) he dreamed that
he saw a corpse hung up by a bush topside of Lincombe Weir—
it was "standing like" in the water, he did not know who it was,
but next morning thought it must be one of " they who was
drowned up river." He said he told several people what he had
dreamed and that he intended to look for the body. " On Thurs
day morning I went down river with George Richards about a
barking job, and as we were returning George was for going home
by the road, but I said, No—we will go by the river, I want to
find that fellow that was drowned. When we came to a place a bit
below the Weir then I saw it under a bush standing in the water ;
we got King and a policeman to help us get it out of the water
and into a boat."
I asked, " In your dream did you see a bush and a body standing
out of the water ? " " Yes, but not in the position I actually
found it." " Did you know Price ? " " No, but I went to find one
of them."
Though I forgot to ask if the body was found on that side of
the river that Butler dreamed it to be, I gathered that it was so.
LE M. TAYLOR.
Colonel Taylor adds:
April 29/A, 1903.
I was told that Lincombe Lock was six miles more or less from
Bewdley.
The Weir was of course a likely place to find the bodies, one of
four, I think he said, between Bewdley and Lincombe where the
river-man King would expect to find them.
Butler is just a labourer who takes up any job he can get, and
OCT., 1903. Cases. 123
has frequently worked in the river, mostly salmon-fishing, below the
Lock.
Butler and George Richards went down river by road, and
would have returned by road only that Butler insisted on returning
by river bank.
P. 275. Dream.
The following premonitory dream is typical of a class of
dreams which is probably not uncommon. The case is un
usually well authenticated, since the dream was recorded before
its fulfilment, and the record still exists. But it will be seen
that there is little or nothing in it to suggest a genuine power
of precognition,—that is, of any foresight of the future beyond
ordinary human powers of inference or guessing.
We first noticed the case in a paragraph in the Pall Mall
Gazette of April 7th, 1903, under the heading "A famous
Gentleman Jockey.—The Career of Mr. Thomas Pickernell,"
—from which we extract the following :
In December, 1870, Mr. Pickernell received a letter from Lord
Poulett in which the nobleman asked him to ride The Lamb in
the Grand National. His lordship informed him that the previous
night he twice dreamed that he saw the race run. The first time
The Lamb was last, and the second time had won by four lengths,
and Mr. Pickernell rode him. "Mr. Thomas," as he was generally
called, duly rode The Lamb at Liverpool, and the horse won by
four lengths.
An Associate of the Society, Mr. Benjamin Davies, of Bir
mingham, kindly undertook to investigate the case, and reported
to us as follows :
May 23rd, 1903.
Mr. Thomas Pickernell who rode the "Lamb" in the Liverpool
race in 1871 lives at present at 16 Valentine Rd., King's Heath.
I interviewed Mr. Pickernell at his residence on the 15th of May
last concerning Lord Poulett's dream. Mr. Pickernell at once
became interested when I mentioned the subject, and it was evident
that he had always regarded the premonitory dream coupled with
the winning of the race as a remarkable event. Mr. Pickernell very
kindly offered every assistance, saying that Lord Poulett's letter
was in his possession. He reached from a shelf a scrap book con
taining [a] few letters and many press notices concerning his own
124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1908.
performances on the race-course. Into this book Poulett's letter
had been gummed. Mr. Pickernell read me the letter, and on a
subsequent occasion (18th of May) I copied it. The following is a
copy of the letter:
"Private. • Army and Navy Club, London, S.W.
Thursday Night, Dec. \5th [1870].
My dear Tommy,
Let me know for certain if you can ride for
me for Liverpool—on The Lamb. I dreamt twice last night I saw
the race run. The first dream he was last and finished amongst
the carriages. The second dream, I should think an hour afterwards,
I saw the Liverpool run. He won by four lengths, and you rode
him, and I stood above the winning post at the turn. I saw the
cerise and blue sleeves and you as plain as I write this.
Now let me know as soon as you can, and say nothing to
anyone. Yours sincerely,
POULETT."
The letter has been slightly damaged, having got by accident
into the .hands of a five-year-old girl, who tore it. The letter, owing
to this, cannot be removed from the book, but Mr. Pickernell has
kindly offered the loan of the book should that become necessary.
Meanwhile I have seen the letter, and here certify that the above
is a correct copy.
Along with the letter in the scrap-book, there was a newspaper
cutting giving the result of the race. Neither the name of the paper
or its date, however, had been recorded. I therefore looked up in the
Birmingham Public Library the newspapers of 1871, and found that
the cutting was taken from The Times (London) of March 22nd, 1871.
The description there of the last phase of the race is as follows :
" Pearl Diver always lay in the middle of his horses, but never
went to the front; while the little grey pony, always about a third
or fourth, took the lead when fairly in the straight, and Rufus being
disposed of, had only to shake off Dispatch to go in a very clever
winner by two lengths."
The little " grey pony " is The Lamb. The Lamb therefore won
by two lengths according to The Times, not by four lengths as given
in the enclosed cutting from the Pall Mall Gazette, and as dreamt
by Lord Poulett. But Mr. Pickernell thinks it was really by four
lengths. This, however, is merely an impression, depending solely
on memory. Mr. Pickernell tells me that, regarded from a sporting
point of view, it matters little whether it was by two or by four
OCT., 1903. Cases. 125
lengths he won, and that other papers might have possibly stated
four lengths. The Times, however, was the only paper available at
the Library. I looked up the pages of the Birmingham Gazette, but
found the copy for the particular date required missing.
I looked up The Times also with regard to the position The Lamb
held in the estimation of sporting men, which could be obtained
from the betting and from the running previous to the race.
The betting was 6 to 1 and 5 to 1 and thereabouts against The
Lamb.
The following quotation taken from a description of the Liver
pool Spring Meeting shows the high position The Lamb held :
" Of course, there were the usual shades of opinion, but there
was a pretty general unanimity as to the great improvement made
in The Doctor, the wonderful fitness of The Lamb. . . . The Lamb,
considered by Lord Poulett to be 21 Ib. a better horse than he was
in 1868, after being a good deal knocked about in the market, became
a very strong favourite in the course of last week, and disputed the
lead with Pearl Diver." (The Times, March 21, 1871.)
Mr. Pickernell tells me that the entry for The Lamb had not
been made at the time of the dream. B. DAVIES.
The sporting news in the Times for the last few days before
the race shows that The Lamb was steadily advancing in the
public favour. The Times of March 16th, 1871, says:
"For the Grand National, Pearl Diver proved in great
demand. . . . The Colonel, after being supported for a little
at 15—2, receded to 8—1. . . . The Lamb, who had made
a marked advance at the Clubs in the morning, found friends
at 9—1, about £100."
On that day, out of thirteen horses, the first three favourites
were Pearl Diver (11—2 against), The Colonel (8—1 against),
and The Lamb (9—1 against).
The Times of March 20th reports that The Lamb had
advanced to the second place among sixteen horses, the betting
being then 11—2 against Pearl Diver, 13—2 against The
Lamb, and 15—2 against The Colonel, and it was remarked
that The Lamb's supporters " appeared to be very confident."
In the Times of March 22nd The Lamb has the second
place among twenty-one horses, the betting being 4—1 against
Pearl Diver, 5—1 against The Lamb, and 8—1 against The
Colonel.

L. 1132. Crystal Vision.
The following apparently telepathic case of crystal vision
was kindly obtained for us by Miss Emily Ford of Adel
Grange, Leeds. The account was enclosed in a letter from Miss
Ford to Sir Oliver Lodge, dated September 6th, 1903, and is
as follows :—
One afternoon, during the absence of ray brother in Normandy,
I was asked to look in a ring containing a semi-transparent Persian
stone of dark green colour. I was to think of my brother and see
if any picture in the stone would reveal his whereabouts. After a
few moments of gazing with no result, I was going to hand the
ring back, when quite suddenly I distinctly saw a lovely little
sea-piece. A lighthouse stood at the end of a ridge of rocks
which were shewing well above the blue water, it being clearly
low tide. A little fishing vessel with dark reddish-brown sails was
further out to sea to the left of the lighthouse. I was astonished
to see it all so plainly, but thinking my brother was at Eouen,
could find no connexion with him. However on his return two
days later I told him of my experiment, when he said that he had,
at that identical time, been looking at exactly the view I described
from his hotel window at Cherbourg. It had struck him as being
so pretty, that he called the friend with whom he was travelling
to admire it with him. I thereupon made a rough sort of sketch
of what I had seen and shewed it to this friend without telling him
the reason. He at once recognised it also. This happened about
August 18th, 1898, at Alton in Hampshire. I may add that I
have never myself visited Cherbourg either before or after this
incident. ADELA F. SUMNKR.
To this account are added the signatures of Miss Sumner's
brother, Mr. F. H. Sumner, of All Saints Vicarage, Alton,
Hants, and the friend who was with him at the time, Mr.
Richard B. Knight, of Chawton, Alton, Hants, both stating
that they witnessed the view mentioned.
In reply to further questions, Miss Sumner writes :—
All Saints Vicarage, Alton, Hants, September 9tk, 1903.
My brother (F. H. Sumner) says it was about 6.30 p.m. when he
saw the view. His friend (Rich. B. Knight) thought by signing
his name that he did substantiate the whole story. I am afraid
I cannot ask him to write any more ; he is away travelling at
present. A. F. SUMNER.
OCT., 1903. Cases. 127
It is probable that many persons, if they tried the experi
ment with some perseverance, might succeed in getting
occasional telepathic impressions through crystal vision, and
we are always glad to receive accounts of such from our
members or any other persons. To make the accounts of
high evidential value, it is of course necessary that the vision
should have been written down in detail, with the date, and
authenticated by a witness, before it was known whether it
corresponded to any real events or not, and that the record
should be forthcoming afterwards.
We must again urge on our readers the desirability of
making experiments in this way, so that the results may be
available for scientific purposes.
CASE OF SUBJECTIVE HALLUCINATION.
FROM time to time we have printed in the Journal cases
illustrating the superior powers of observation or of memory
possessed by the subliminal self. The following case seems
to illustrate another mental process which is generally more
or less subliminal,—namely, the formation of mental images
through association of ideas ;—the hallucination evoked being
apparently traceable to the association in the percipient's mind
of the person seen with a name sub-consciously perceived on a
door.
The percipient was an Associate of the Society who wishes
his initials only to be used here. On the afternoon of April
29th, 1902, he was present at some thought-transference ex
periments held at the rooms of the Society at 20 Hanover
Square, W., and wrote to Mr. Piddington the same evening as
follows :
On leaving you this afternoon, and in passing one of the landings,
I thought I saw Dr. N of Hospital. He seemed to be
standing still, as if in thought, and carried a bag.
As I passed down the staircase, I wondered what he was doing
at 20 Hanover Square, and looked at the name-board in the Hall.
I there saw the name of the Society. Dr. N is one of
the senior physicians at Hospital.
To [the best of] my recollection I have not noticed before that
1 28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1903.
the Society was in your building, and on returning here I
looked up your last Eeport [i.e. the S.P.R. Journal] to see whether
there was anything there which could have guided my mind un
consciously. I find the names of several other tenants connected
with the medical profession, but none such as the Society,
which might have suggested sub-consciously Dr. N .
However, I have written him a letter, of which I send you a
copy, and will show you his reply, if there is any interest to you.
G. M.
The copy is as follows :
Dear Dr. N ,
Will you kindly 'tell me whether you were at 20 Hanover Square
this afternoon at 4.35 or thereabouts1)
I will tell you my reason for asking when I receive your reply.
Apologising for troubling you, I am, dear Dr. N ,
Yours very faithfully,
G. M.
Dr. N replied on April 2 9 :
Dear Mr. M ,
No, I have not been to 20 Hanover Square for some time—a
week or more.
Yours truly,
E. N. [assumed initials].
On April 30th, 1902, Mr. G M again wrote to
Dr. N as follows :
... I will now tell you the reason of my inquiry, but please
don't think my mind is unhinged.
I had been engaged in some thought-transference experiments at
the Rooms of the Society for Psychical Research yesterday afternoon,
when on coming down the staircase I saw, or thought I saw, you
standing quite still, in an attitude of thought, with a bag [in your
hands]. My first impression was one of surprise at seeing you there,
as I had no idea that the Society had rooms there, and as
you seemed to disappear almost immediately, I wondered whether
I had seen you, or was the victim of imagination. I therefore looked
at the name-board in the hall, and found the name of the
Society.
I therefore ventured to write you to clear up my doubts as to
whether you were there or not.
OCT., 1903. Case of Subjective Hallucination. 129
The incident left a very curious impression on my mind, and this
has increased since I have received your letter . . .
Dr. N replied as follows on April 30th, 1902:
Dear Mr. M ,
Thanks for your letter of explanation. As a fact, I drove through
Hanover Square in the afternoon on my way to Hospital,
but at the time you named I was in the midst of a difficult operation
in the hospital, so that the " thought " transference experiment was
erroneous.1
R N .
Mr. G M had an interview with Dr. N on
May 10th, 1902, and on May 12th sent the following answers
to some questions asked by Mr. Piddington, together with a
letter, given below, dated May 12th:
Q. On what landing did you see the figure?
A. I did not remember at the time, but on my next visit to 20
Hanover Square, I saw that it must have been the first floor, as 1
was coming down the stone staircase.
Q. Why, if you thought it was Dr. N , did you not speak to
him 1
A. No time.
Q. Do you think the figure you saw was that of a real man
whom you mistook for Dr. N 1 If not, why not 1
A. It is difficult to describe, but at first I must have thought
the figure real, as I said to myself " Dr. N ! " and wondered
what he was doing there.
Q. What happened to the figure 1 e.g. Did it suddenly dissolve ?
or did you lose sight of it 1 or did it precede you downstairs J or
did it go into a room ''.
A. It was an instantaneous vision. It did not dissolve gradually,
but was gone almost as soon as I saw it.
Q. Did you pass the figure •
A. No.
Q. When you have met Dr. N before, has he usually been
carrying a bag?
A. Dr. N attended [a very near relative] in her fatal illness,
'This reference to an experiment was, of coarse, due to a misapprehension, the
hallucination having no connection with any experiment.
130 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1908.
and on the occasion of his first visit brought a bag. I have not
seen him with a bag on any other occasion.
Q. Did you know that Dr. N was a member of the
Society 1 or was your assumption that he naturally would be so
strong as to amount to a practical certainty ?
A. No ; but when I saw the name on the board in the hall, after
seeing the hallucination on the staircase, I thought it almost a
practical certainty that he was a member, and I therefore began to
think it must have been Dr. N in reality after all, and that I
had missed seeing where he went to.
Q. Have you ever had any similar experience?
A. No.
Q. Is Dr. N intimately known to you ?
A. Yes.
... I am beginning to think that I must have unconsciously
seen the name of the Society on the door J as I came downstairs,
and visualized, so to speak, Dr. N as [he was] when I first saw
him at [the deathbed of a very near relative]. I do not know
whether .you think that a possible explanation, but dates do not
seem to fit any other hypothesis. . . .
Another possible explanation of the hallucination was sug
gested by Mr. Piddington in a letter to Mr. M as follows :
May 2nd, 1902.
. . . You had, I believe, attended some thought-transference ex
periments before those held on April 29. Dr. N says he had
not been to 20 Hanover Square for "some time—a week or more."
Is it possible that your former visit to 20 Hanover Square coincided
with Dr. N 's last visit? You can probably discover the date
of your former visit or visits (it must anyhow be in the notes of
the thought-transference experiments), and you might try to learn
from Dr. N the precise date of his last visit previous to April
29. ... Supposing that you both appear to have been at 20
Hanover Square on the same day and about the same time, it
could be supposed that you did see him, though not consciously ;
and that when you were walking down the stairs on April 29 your
hitherto sub-conscious perception of Dr. N was vividly revived
by the surroundings, and became consciously externalised as a
hallucination.
1 The rooms of the Society are on the first floor, and the name is painted
prominently on one of the doors there.
OCT., 1903. Obituary. 131
On enquiry, however, it turned out that Dr. N had
been at 20 Hanover Square on April 21st, but not on the
following day, which was the date of Mr. M 's first
visit to the S.P.E. rooms.
OBITUARY.
DR. R. OSGOOD MASON.
IN the sudden death, early in May, of Dr. Rufus Osgood
Mason, the American Branch of the S.P.R. has lost one
of its most valued members. As is well known to readers
of our Proceedings and Journals, Dr. Mason's interest in all
psychical subjects was keen and sincere. His two books,
Telepathy and (he Subliminal Self and Hypnotism and Suggestion
(reviewed in Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 610, and Vol. XVII.,
p. 265) are models of impartiality and clarity of style; and
the former of these, at any rate, might well form a useful
" primer " (if the term be allowable) of psychical research.
Dr. Mason occasionally contributed to our Journal, and wrote
many articles at various times on the subjects of hypnotism
and suggestion—especially in their therapeutic aspect—double
personality, etc., for some of the leading scientific and
medical journals in America. Shortly before his death, he
also wrote two long reviews of Myers' Human Personality
for the New York Times (Literary Supplement). For a busy
practising physician this evidences no little interest in a
matter so obscure and unprofitable. Some of Dr. Mason's
experiments in hypnotism, however, actually antedated those
of the famous Charcot, and he was evidently a serious student
of psychical phenomena even prior to the foundation of the
S.P.R.
To those of us who had the pleasure of knowing Dr. Mason
personally, his loss represents not only that of a sincere
worker, and an enthusiastic, yet critical, student ; but also
that of a loving spirit, a charming personality, and a true
friend. HEREWARD CARRINGTON

NOTE ON THE ALLEGED PREDICTION
OF THE SERVIAN MURDERS.
IMMEDIATELY after the assassination of the King and Queen of
Servia in the middle of last June, statements appeared in several
newspapers that the event had been predicted about three months
beforehand by a medium, Mrs. Burchell, at a se'ance held under
the auspices of Mr. W. T. Stead, the Editor of The Review of
Reviews. Mr. Stead brought the case to our notice and kindly
offered us information about it, stating, however, that he was
" not very sanguine as to any results following," and that " no
notes were taken at the time."
The main facts asserted were that in March last Mrs. Burchell
predicted a violent death for a king, while holding in her hand
an envelope containing a piece of paper with the signature of
King Alexander of Servia. On this occurrence being reported
to the Servian Minister in London (who was, as he afterwards
informed us, already very anxious about the state of affairs in
Servia), he made a note of it in his diary, and wrote to urge his
Royal Master to be careful.
Our preliminary enquiries concerning this at first sight inter
esting case, however, revealed fundamental defects in the evidence,
when considered critically, so that it became our opinion that
there was no primd facie case for thorough investigation, and
the enquiry was therefore discontinued. This course seemed
amply justified by a consideration of the evidence for the case,
as presented by Mr. Stead in the July Review of Reviews.
Mr. Stead, however, attacks the officers of the Society in the
August number of his magazine for dropping the investigation.
In the September number of the Review of Reviews Sir Oliver
Lodge defends the attitude of the Society on general grounds,
and in Light, of September 19th, Mr. Piddington discusses in
detail Mr. Stead's evidence for the prediction. To these
articles we refer any members who may be interested in the
subject.

HYPNOTISM :
ITS HISTOKY, PRACTICE, AND THEORY.
BY J. MILNE BRAMWELL, M.B., C.M.
8»o. 478 page*. 18.*. ntt.
The chief aim of this monograph is to draw the attention of medical men
to the therapeutic value of Hypnotism. The author gives the results of
twelve years of his own practice and research, with personal observations
of the work ilone in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and
Belgium.
The historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively
little known work of the English pioneers, Elliotson, Esdaile, and Braid,
while the final chapter of references contains much information which has
not hitherto been published in accessible form.
The methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and
instructions given in regard to the management of the hypnotic state, with
details as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis Hypnotic theories are
described and discussed, and special prominence is given to Mr. Myers's
theory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the
problems of hypnotism.

OBITUARY.
THE REV. MAXWELL H. CLOSE.
WE have recently lost through death at the ripe age of 81,
one of the most learned members of our Society, who was from
its foundation a generous supporter and warm friend. The
name of the Rev. Maxwell Close was probably unknown except
to a very small circle of our members, but those who had the
privilege of his friendship knew him to be a man of singular
intellectual power, whose knowledge of many subjects was as
profound as it was wide, and withal a man of such unassum
ing modesty that he shrank from any recognition of the
services he rendered to science, so that some of his most
original work was published under an assumed name. And
not only was his learning great, his sympathies were equally
wide and his charities innumerable ; 1 have sometimes been
his almoner, but he never allowed the recipient to know from
whom the bequest had come.
The Maxwell Closes are a well-known Irish family, and
the Rev. Maxwell Close, except for a few years' clerical work
in England, lived all his life and died in Dublin. The range
of his learning may be surmised from the fact that he won
Divinity honours after graduating at Trinity College, Dublin,
was a considerable classical and Hebrew scholar, was versed
in the Irish language, the strange script of which he wrote
with great beauty, and took an active and generous part in
the Celtic revival. But his chief interest and studies were in
mathematics and science ; his valuable contributions to geology
led to his being elected President of the Geological Society of
Ireland. He was one of the highest authorities on the ancient
glaciation of Ireland ; he published original papers on astronomy,
and wrote a brief treatise on this subject, entitled " Chapters
on Astronomy by Claudius Kennedy " ; whilst under the name
of Laurence O'Toole he issued a remarkably able tractate on
" Force," in which he broke a lance with some of the leaders
of science ! Owing to the fact that these publications are
known only to a few, they have not received the attention
they deserve from scientific men ; their pages are full of
original thought and marked with that learning and historical
Nov., 1903. Obituary. 135
knowledge which distinguished Maxwell Close. So much was
his opinion and criticism valued that he was constantly asked to
read the proof sheets and revise the works of eminent writers
on various scientific subjects ; this labour he freely undertook
and carried out with unwearied care. But the great work of
the latter part of his life was at the Royal Irish Academy,
where he held the post of Hon. Treasurer for many years, and
daily devoted himself to the business of the Academy.
His interest in Psychical Research was profound and he
followed its development with the deepest interest. It is no
little testimony to the soundness of the work done by our
Society that a man of such erudition and critical judgment as
Maxwell Close accepted even advanced views on Psychical
subjects, and had the highest opinion of the importance of
our work and its supreme value in the evolution of human
thought. W. F. B.
CASES.
G. 274. Apparition.
IN the following case, a person who had recently died was
believed to have been seen by an acquaintance who was
unaware of her death. It is impossible to prove that it
was not a case of misrecognition, but the details tend to show
that this explanation is at least improbable. The case was sent
to us by Mr. Ernest G. Henham, who writes :
BEKESBOURNE, WALLINGFORD, BERKS., June Mi, [1903.]
After a good deal of deliberation I have resolved to send you the
following experience :
I was a student at St. Edward's School, Oxford, from autumn
1881 to Easter 1890, and during that long period Miss S. [full
name given] (the well-known philanthropist) was constantly at the
school, being a great friend of the then Warden (the Rev. A. B.
Simeon, well known in Oxford High Church circles). Of course I
saw Miss S. constantly, often several times in one week. She was
for many years perhaps the best-known figure in Oxford.
I was abroad from 1890 to Christmas 1894. In July, 1899, I
came to live here, and in November of that year bicycled from
here to Oxford to visit my old school, not having entered Oxford
since Easter 1890. As I approached the Martyrs' Memorial I saw
136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1903.
Miss S. She passed a very little way ahead of me, across the
road, towards the Ashmolean, with her usual brisk and active style,
the inevitable basket upon her arm. I don't suppose I had given
the good lady a thought during the past nine years or so, but I
was very pleased to see her there, having seen no other familiar
face during my ride through Oxford. I know I was surprised to
see her looking so well and strong and active despite her years,
and I slowed up, feeling a strong desire to speak to her, but on
reaching the pavement where Beaumont Street begins, I lost sight
of her in the crowd.
That incident of meeting with Miss S. always stood out very
strongly in my memory (which is an exceptionally powerful one),
but I thought little of it until about a month ago her life came
into my hands (published by John Murray, 1902). While turning
over the pages something seemed to say to me, " It was her spirit
you saw that day." Immediately I looked up the date of her death
and found she had passed over on Friday, the 5th (or perhaps it
was the 6th—I have not got the book now) of October, 1899. It
was at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 15th November, that I saw her in
Oxford, more than a mouth later.
I must own I took no particular interest in Miss S., and really
had no wish to see her, incarnate or otherwise. I need scarcely
add I did not at the time know she was dead, and I certainly was
not thinking of her, even remotely. . . .
ERNEST G. HENHAM.
In reply to inquiries, Mr. Henham gave us the following
further details :
BEKESBOURNE, WALLINGFORD, BERKS., June l&th, [1903.]
I have your letter of yesterday's date relating to mine of June 9th,
in which I recounted to you my experience of seeing the apparition
of Miss S. in Oxford on November 15th, 1899. In regard to the
questions contained in your letter I beg to reply as follows :
There was no possible doubt about the identity—if I may so use
the word in this connection. I have such a strong memory that if
I only pass a person on the street, I remember the face if I see
it again. Besides, Miss S., once seen, could never be mistaken for
any one else. Any one in Oxford would tell you that. I was very
close to her and saw her face. I remember noticing that it was
very white, also that she took no notice of any one—nor of the
traffic—and was walking faster than I had ever known her to do.
It was not like her to disregard passers-by. She was dressed as I
Nov., i9oa Cases. 137
had always seen her and carrying her customary basket. There
may be many old ladies like Miss S. in temperament, but I have
seen none at all resembling her in appearance. It was she beyond
all question. I may mention that I have rather peculiar eyesight,
more powerful I suppose than is ordinary, because it enables me to
see in the dark,—not with absolute clearness, of course, but I am
able to distinguish outlines. I have always boasted of possessing
"night eyes."
I regret to say it is impossible for me to produce witnesses.
Naturally I had no cause for astonishment at meeting with Miss S.,
not knowing her to be dead. I remember mentioning to an aunt
with whom I live, in an off-hand manner, that I had seen the good
old lady, but my aunt is an old woman who remembers nothing.
About the date there is absolutely no doubt. I knew that the day
was Wednesday, but could not remember whether it was the end
of October or beginning of November. Fortunately my aunt keeps
a diary, and often puts down my little expeditions, and it was from
her diary that I discovered the day was November 15, and as I
remember reaching my destination (Summertown) about 3.15, it
must roughly have been 3 when I saw Miss S.
However, I can prove the date in another way. It is a weari
some journey from here to Oxford by train, and though I have
often been to Oxford I have always bicycled. I came to live here
in July, 1899, and being a horseman I had then a hatred for bicycles.
But after a time I saw that to a dweller in the country a machine
was indispensable, and being unable to keep a horse I resolved on
getting a bicycle. So one day I went to 'Reading, bought a machine,
and paid cash for it. Fortunately I have still the receipt, and it
is dated October 3rd. Miss S. died on the 5th (or 6th) of October.
I did not begin to learn to ride until several days after I bought
the bicycle. I was certainly on the machine when I saw the appari
tion. Therefore, even if the date of November loth had not been
recorded, here you have conclusive evidence that I could not have
visited Oxford until after Miss S.'s death. . . .
ERNEST G. HKNHAM.
We have verified the date of Miss S.'s death, which was
October 6th, 1899. With regard to her personal appearance,
Mr. E. N. Bennett writes :
I knew Miss S. personally. She was a woman of strongly
marked individuality and strongly marked features,—a familiar figure
in Oxford and not easy to mistake.
138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1903.
L. 1133. Dream.
In January, 1903, Mr. A. H. Atkins of 3 Clarendon Park,
Torquay, sent us an account of several apparently telepathic
experiences that had occurred in his own family, among which
was the following :—
When my daughter returned from Switzerland she was accom
panied by a schoolfellow who was going to a situation at London
as governess. On reaching England they parted and never met
again. Once only my daughter heard of her that she was married.
Now, my daughter who lives in Birmingham still, struck up a very
warm friendship with another schoolfellow and they correspond
regularly.
Towards the end of last year [i.e. 1902] she dreamt that she saw
the girl who came to England with her and her husband. They
appeared well and in very good circumstances. By the next post
came a letter from her Swiss friend saying that Alice Birman
(now Mrs. Smith) and her husband had called on her without any
warning. They were very well off and had a sudden whim to go
on the Continent, followed by another to call on her old friend.
My daughter at once wrote for a description of Mr. Smith, and it
corresponded singularly with the visionary gentleman. In the dream
he was fair, with a gentle air, and shorter than his wife, and had
a slight, fair moustache, and also told my daughter they were
going to an exhibition. In reality he was the same, only clean
shaven, and they were going that day to show a dog at an
exhibition.
I may add that my daughter sent me the description of the
dream Mr. Smith before she received that of the real one, and
before she opened [the] first letter was convinced it would say some
thing about [the incidents of her dream].
On May 5th, 1903, Mr. Atkins sent us the following letter
from his daughter, to whom he had transmitted a series of
questions at our request.
29 Gower Street, Aston, Monday evening.
Dear Father,
Re the enclosed papers I herewith give you a signed
description of the whole matter, and luckily I have found the letter
from Sophie which I received the morning of my dream. . . .
Of course I have not my letter asking for a description of Mr.
Smith, but I enclose Sophie's comment thereupon.
Nov., 1903. Cases. 139
I did not mention my dream to any one before reading the
letter, but I told Mrs. Edwards at our office of the remarkable
coincidence.
I put in my letter to Sophie detailing my dream " Mr. Smith of
my dream was an inch or two shorter than Alice [his wife], fair
moustache and skin, gentlemanly and quiet behaviour." There is no
corroborative evidence, unless I described him to you whilst waiting
Sophie's reply.
I did not in any way connect my dream of Mr. and Mrs. Smith
with Sophie.
I had never seen or heard anything of Mr. Smith except that
Alice Birman had married a Mr. Smith.
With the above letter were enclosed
(1) A letter dated October 27th, 1902, in which Miss
Edith Atkins first mentioned her dream to her
parents.
(2) A letter dated January 13th, 1903, addressed by Miss
Atkins to her parents after the receipt of a letter from
Mile. Sophie Niederhauser, her Swiss friend.
(3) Copy of an extract from the letter received by Miss
Atkins the morning after her dream from Miss Sophie
Niederhauser, of Aarau, Switzerland, and dated 23rd
October, 1902.
(4) Copy of an extract from a letter addressed by Miss
Niederhauser to Miss Atkins in reply to her enquiries
for a personal description of Mr. Smith. The letter is
dated merely "Nov. 1902."
These are printed below. Miss Niederhauser's letters were in
French, but are here translated.
(1) October 27th, 1902.
. . . Talking about dreams, Sophie's letter adds one to the very
curious list of coincidences in this respect, to wit :—I had not
thought or heard anything of Alice Birman or Smith as she is now
since her marriage ; I only knew she was married to a man named
Smith about two years ago. Well, Friday night I dreamt I met
her with her husband, and she seemed to be in a flourishing
condition, both exceedingly well dressed ; they were staying at a
hotel in the place where we met them, where it was I don't know,
and they were going to some exhibition or other. I remarked to
Ma in my dream, she being with me, "Alice seems to have done

well, she has just the same ideas as before." There endeth my
dream ; I woke up, dressed, and went downstairs Saturday morning,
where I found a letter from Sophie awaiting me, and almost at the
outset of her letter she informs me that Alice and her husband
called on them suddenly last Saturday week. They are very well
to do, and keep three servants, and were just having a little trip
on the Continent, having made up their minds quite suddenly to
do so ; they were staying at a hotel in Aarau, and also Alice is
exhibiting one of her dogs in a dog show in London this week.
While reading this epistle it seemed to me that I was reading
something I already knew quite well. Rather a remarkable coinci
dence, that ! I am going to give Sophie a description of her
husband as I saw him in the dream, and I quite expect it will
tally with that of the real man.
(2) January IZth, 1903.
. . . Alice Birman Smith's husband corresponded with my dream
in that he is very fair, with delicate features and a gentle
demeanour and smaller than Alice ; only in my dream he was only
slightly smaller than Alice, whereas he would appear to be a good
deal smaller, and Sophie says he is clean-shaved, and I dreamt he
had a fair moustache. Of course, if I were to see the man I could
tell in an instant if he resembled my dream, and at all events,
considering I had not the slightest idea of what he was like, my
dream was fairly accurate, and besides that the incidents resembled
very much the way that Sophie saw Alice ; to wit, they were
staying at a hotel, called on Sophie quite unexpectedly, both
together, and were going to an exhibition to show a dog; the only
difference in my dream was that I met them in the road ; all the
other particulars were correct. What strikes me as more wonderful,
though, was the feeling when I read Sophie's letter that I already
knew what she was telling me, a feeling perfectly clear and strong;
that I think is the strongest proof of brain communication, far
more important than the exact accuracy of the details.
(3) Letter from Miss Sophie Niederhauser, October 23rd, 1902.
On Sunday I had visitors from England—can you guess whom ?
Alice Birman—now Mrs. Smith—with her husband. They came
here quite unexpectedly and as we have only one bed for visitors,
they were obliged to go to the hotel. They took tea with us at
four o'clock but dined at the hotel. They came at ten o'clock on
Nov., 1903. Cases. 141
Saturday evening and went away at nine on Monday morning.
For a long time I had heard nothing of Alice.
Alice has three servants in her household—a cook, a housemaid,
and a nurse. Mr. Smith does not speak German ; he is an agree
able man, so gentle and amiable. They seem to live like children,
happy and affectionate. They had decided to come to Switzerland
suddenly, one evening. Mr. Smith brought home the tickets and
they set off the same night. Alice's child is ten weeks old ; he is
called O. F. Alice is just as she always was ; she is quite different
from our other friends. She went on to Zurich, Lucerne, Bale, and
Paris, from whence she is going home this morning. On Friday
morning she is to go to a dog show in London with one of her
three dogs. I have her photograph in which she has on one side
her baby, a beautiful child, and on the other a very fine dog. She
seemed a little older than before. . . . The visit was over so quickly
that I almost feel as if I had dreamt it.
(4) Second letter from Miss Sophie Niederhauser, November, 1 902.
It is certainly very curious that you dreamt of Alice before
getting my letter. Alice's husband is smaller than she,—about as
tall as your brother, I think,—and he is very fair, with delicate
features, and no moustache ; has good manners, and a rather fair
complexion.
APPARENT PREMONITIONS.
WHETHER or not genuine premonitions, in the strict sense of
the word, ever occur, is still uncertain ; but we certainly
meet occasionally with sporadic phenomena simulating this
character, which it is difficult to ascribe to anything but
chance coincidence. Two instances of this type are given
below.
I.
In "M.A.P." for June 6th, 1903, it was related that
Captain Robert Marshall had dreamt beforehand that " Sir
Hugo" was the winner of the 1892 Derby, and had backed
his dream, although " Sir Hugo " was a rank outsider. In con
sequence of this statement we wrote to Captain Marshall on
June 24th, 1903, asking the following questions, to which
his replies are appended :
142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1903.
(1) Did you speak of your dream to any one before the race?
and if so to whom 1 Ans. To several brother officers and others,
Major Bruce, Captain Fedden, etc.
(2) Have you ever before or since dreamt about a horse-race ?
Ans. No.
(3) Was the dream in question a particularly vivid or impressive
one ') Ans. Yes.
(4) Have you on any other occasion acted on a dream 1 Ans. No.
(5) Did you act on this dream because you thought it would
come true, or in a half joking spirit ? Ans. Because I felt a curious
certainty about it.
(6) Have you ever had any other dream that has proved
" veridical " 1 Ans. No.
(7) Had you any special interest in 'this Derby, and had you
any reason to suppose that Sir Hugo was a better horse than
might have been inferred from the state of the betting? Ans. No.
I did not even know such a horse was entered.
(8) Did you (if this is not too impertinent a question) back your
dream fancy for such an amount as you would not have cared to
have lost? Ans. Yes. R. MARSHALL.
In the sporting news of the Times for June 1st, 1892,
the betting on the Derby on the previous day (May 31st)
is given. Eleven horses were entered, and of these " Sir
Hugo" came 10th on the list, the betting being 50 to 1
against him. It was stated that
. . . Nothing occurred which could be construed as having the
slightest bearing on the Derby, unless it was the victory of Lord
Bradford's " Cuttlestone," who has been the trial horse of Sir Hugo.
... El Diablo and Sir Hugo are reported to be much fitter than
when they ran for the Two Thousand a month ago.
The Times, June 2nd, 1892, gives the following in its
leading article :
We had yesterday a beautiful Derby Day, and an eventful
Derby. . . . The race was won by an outsider. . . . No one knew
who was to win . . . and " bar one " it was anybody's race. . . .
A few, a very few, supported Sir Hugo, whose good looks were
as much in his favour as his public record was against him. Three
times at least had this handsome creature been well beaten ; in the
Champagne Stakes, in the Middle Park Plate, and in the Two
Thousand. ... On the other hand Lord Bradford is a sportsman
Nov., 1903. Apparent Premonition. 143
who cannot for a moment be suspected of allowing his horse to run
below his merits, and if the horse is to win, it must be either
because he was fairly improved or because the Derby course will
suit him better than the Two Thousand course.
When it came to the race, Kueil, said to be the best of the
French horses, was so unfortunate as to start very badly, and his
chance was early extinguished. The struggle resolved itself into
one between Sir Hugo and La Fleche, in which the horse had the
advantage throughout, winning with comparative ease by nearly a
length. The result was not surprise ; it was amazement. The
rankest outsider since the days of Hermit or Caractacus had won ;
and what was more, he was a horse who had been thrice beaten,
easily beaten, by his now defeated opponents. The public was so
nonplussed— and had perhaps lost so many bets—that it would not
even cheer, though Lord Bradford is a popular owner, who till now
has been unfortunate.
The " Sporting Intelligence " of the same paper says :
. . . Nothing was more admired, as far as shape and make go,
than Sir Hugo, but so he had been in the Birdcage previous to
the Two Thousand, and those who had most to say in his favour
were bound to admit that he could have no earthly chance on
paper, seeing that he had been decisively beaten by several of the
horses he had to meet. . . .
In the betting of the same date, "Sir Hugo" comes 10th in
the list out of thirteen horses, the betting being 40 to 1
against him ; in the " place betting " it had fallen to 5 to 1
against him. It seems thus clear that his chance of winning
appeared very remote.
We then wrote to Captain C. A. Fedden, to whom Captain
Marshall had referred us for corroboration, and he replied as
follows :
DRILL HALL, HALIFAX, 22«d July, 1903.
... I have pleasure in attaching overleaf my remembrance of
Captain Robert Marshall's dream concerning the winner of the
Derby in 1891 or 1892. I have no means at hand of fixing the
year nearer, but it was the year that " Sir Hugo " won the race,
starting at the outside price of 40 or 50 to 1. I backed it at, I
think, 50—1 a few days before the race.
CLEMENT A. FEDDEN,
Capt. , West Biding Regiment.
144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1903.
In the year 1891 or 1892, I cannot say which, but it was the
year in which "Sir Hugo" won the Derby, I was stationed at
Halifax Barracks; Captain Robert Marshall of my regiment was
stationed there also.
A few days before the Derby was to be run, Captain Marshall
came in to breakfast in the mess, and said he had dreamt the
winner of the Derby, that he had seen the race run, and had heard
the crowd shouting the horse's name.
On being asked the horse's name, he said he could not remember,
but would know it, if he heard it.
We accordingly read out the names of the horses mentioned in
the betting from a newspaper, but he said the name was not there.
The next day we looked in the paper again, and read out amongst
other names of horses that of " Sir Hugo," which was not
mentioned in the issue of the previous day.1
Immediately the name "Sir Hugo" was mentioned, Captain
Marshall said, "That is the horse, that is the one I saw win in my
dream, I shall back it. I heard the crowd shouting out, ' Hugo
Victor,' 'Hugo Victor.'"
Captain Marshall backed "Sir Hugo" to win, and persuaded me
to do the same, so positive was he, though I was very sceptical.
It is a matter of history that "Sir Hugo" won.
Captain Marshall informed me that before going to sleep on the
night in which his dream occurred, he was reading a book by
Victor Hugo. c A FEDDEN,
Capt., West Riding Regiment.
We sent this account to Captain Marshall, who wrote :
The above, with the exception noted, is correct. It may also be
of interest to state that on the day of the race, Captain Fedden
and I left barracks together shortly after 3 p.m. On leaving the
barrack gate, I saw, half a mile off, one of the town buses. I
stopped at once, and said to Captain F., " You see the driver of that
bus? He will tell us that Sir Hugo has won the Derby." When
the bus came along side of us, I stopped. The driver pulled up,
and said, " Have you heard the winner of the Derby, sir ? " I
replied, "No." He then said, "Sir Hugo." The driver knew us
1 To this statement, Captain Marshall adds the following note : "I remem
bered the name ' Hugo ' perfectly, but did not know if a horse of that name
existed. I think, therefore, the lines [from "On being asked" to this point]
are inaccurate."
Nov., 1903. Apparent Premonition. 145
as officers of the garrison, and naturally supposed we would be
glad to hear the result of the race. But my conviction that he
would tell us was so strong, that I think I may say I knew he
would. R. MARSHALL.
Captain Marshall adds :
BERKELEY HOUSE, BERKELEY SQUARE, W., 5th Aug., 1903.
I return Captain Fedden's statements with my comments thereon.
There appears to me really nothing in the whole story except
coincidence of suggestion. The Derby is impending. I read a book
by Victor Hugo in bed. My last half-waking thoughts are possibly
of the race, jumbled with thoughts of the author whose work I
had been reading. Result : I dream of a race, and hear shouts of
Hugo ! Victor ! And who shall number the similar dreams that do
not end so happily for the unfortunate dreamer who backs his
phantom horse. . . .
II.
The second case is related by Mr. A. B. Gough, a friend
of Mr. N. W. Thomas, who tells us that he heard the story
at the time. Mr. Gough writes :
May llth, 1902.
On the evening of Wednesday, the 7th of May, 1902, I went to
the Schiller Theater at Kiel, and saw the premiere of Karl Bleibtreu's
historical drama, Zorndorf. The action takes place in a house in
the village during the battle, and an almost incessant cannonade is
heard. The red glare of burning houses is visible through the
window. A messenger describes an explosion which took place
during the battle.
Afterwards I went to a bodega with K and H , and drank
a glass of sherry, another of vermouth, and another of port, which
made me rather talkative, but I was perfectly sober. I went to
bed about 1.30, and soon fell asleep.
I dreamt I was in my bedroom at home at Redhill. It was
night. I looked out of the window and saw a red glare, accom
panied by a terrific noise, as of a stupendous explosion. I had a
very vivid impression that an appalling disaster had occurred, and
that a whole town, or perhaps several, had been annihilated. I
imagined that a piece of the earth's crust had been blown out, or
in, and that in some way it was due to human carelessness. Almost
immediately after the explosion I saw newspaper boys running up the
146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1903.
road with special editions. 1 woke, and found myself trembling,
and very excited. It was either dawn or daylight, I forget which.
I dozed off, and saw an open newspaper with enormous headlines,
but do not remember what the words were. My idea now was
that Brighton (where I spent a day in the Easter vacation) was
destroyed. I also thought I was in the garden at home with a box
full of loose dynamite, and that my brother placed it in the cellar,
whereat I protested.
I don't think in the first dream there was any thought of
dynamite, and certainly not of a battle, though, no doubt, the
impression made by the glare of the burning houses in the play
suggested part of the dream. The dynamite in the cellar was also
due to the passage in the play, where some one blames the
Russians for their recklessness in blowing up the ammunition which
was stored in a cellar. (I didn't quite catch the drift of this story,
which was spoken very fast.)
I think I was half awake when I imagined Brighton to be the
scene of the disaster.
It was nearly 11 a.m. before I rose, but I had been more or less
awake for about an hour. I was rather sleepy in the morning,
but had no headache.
The eruption of Mt. Pelee, which overwhelmed St. Pierre, took
place between 7 and 8 a.m. on the 8th, which would be about
12—1 mid-day by Berlin time, i.e. at least 3 or 4 hours after the
<lream. A. B. GOUGH.
P.S.—May 14</i. Magnetic disturbances were noted at the Kiel
Observatory both on Wednesday and Thursday. It is thought these
may be connected with the eruption.
The dream was one of the most vivid I have ever had.
Nov. 26lh, 1902.
I thought the foregoing account might possibly interest you,
although I don't suppose there is anything more in it than a coin
cidence. It shows, at any rate, how important it is in such cases
to state the circumstances under which the experience took place.
I have heard since, I believe, that the most violent disturbance
preceded the fatal outbreak by some hours.
In both these cases it is to be noted that the coincidence is
not so much between the dream and the future event as between
the train of circumstances leading up to the dream and the future
event. It was an accidental coincidence that Captain Marshall
Nov., 1903. Mrs. Verrall's Automatic Writing. 147
was reading a book by Victor Hugo shortly before " Sir Hugo "
was victor, and that Mr. Gough heard theatrical cannonading
at about the time of the eruption of Mount Petee ; but the
dreams were clearly connected with the previous impressions of
the dreamers, rather than with the external events that followed.
UNIDENTIFIED NAMES IN MRS. VEKRALL'S
AUTOMATIC WRITING.
IN the course of her automatic writing Mrs. Verrall has found
that a certain number of names occur to which at present she
has no clue. These names may, of course, be merely subliminal
reminiscences of names which she has read or heard. But since
we sometimes find after careful researches that automatic utter
ances at first sight trivial and meaningless turn out to have some
significance, it seems worth while to print these names with their
context in the Journal, on the chance that some reader may be
able to show a connection of any of them with external facts.
Mrs. Verrall writes with regard to them : " I have not put down
a few names which seem to be attempts at something that has
not come out, but I have included all the unknown names which
seem as if they were meant to be identified." They are as
follows :
List of unidentified names occurring in script between March, 1901,
and September, 1903.
(1) 'Frendsham or Frettisham Park, perhaps Frodsham, a place
where something once happened to me.' (Signature) Alec. K.
'At Frodsham there is an old house gabled in a garden.'
'Frodsham and a river in the winter—it was frozen. Alec Keith—
to the friend of another.'
'Frodsham. The house was in a park—water belongs somehow—I
think it was a skating accident. The message came through
Alec.'
(2) ' Rodney, Roland, Ronald, or some name like that. Wilmington
seems the name of the church spire that I see beyond.'
(3) Ralph Nevile, two centuries ago or more. Apparently this R.N.,
'a scholar not a soldier,' died immediately after dining with
the king, and was buried with no inscription upon his tomb.
148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1903.
(4) Dover or Dovercourt. 'There is a woman there. Emmie is the
name. I want a message given to Emmie and the boy Frank.
It is from Harry on the sea to-night. Tell her from me, Harry
thinks of her.'
(5) 'Nesta and Trenerry, this is a new point—not known to you.
The message will be understood by others.'
(In same script as above:)
'Great Crosby is a name that was wanted—and Marston, Everard
Marston I think. Some one will help you with that name.'
(6) 'Maupertuis and Sarrasin, these are names in a book together,
a yellow book with clear good print early printed—some one has
just read it in a library.'
(7) Romenzana ; and perhaps connected with it Clemens.
(8) 'Ask at Smithfield for the name—You do not know. Portals
or Portalis.'
(9) A cross with a green wreath upon it ; 'In honour A. J. C. in
ripis Douern.'
'Crosik or Croisic ought to help you to the cross and wreath.'
Any reader who has any suggestion to make as to the identity
of these names is requested to write to Mrs. Verrall, 5 Selwyn
Gardens, Cambridge.
NOTE ON THE BEVERLEY FARMHOUSE CASE.
REPORTS have appeared in several newspapers during the last
few months as to occurrences at Kaikes Farm, Beverley, York
shire, where, it was said, loaves of bread were constantly
diminishing in a mysterious manner.
We have for some time been engaged in enquiries into this
case, which we find is probably to be explained by ordinary
causes, and we propose to print the particulars in the Journal
as soon as our information is complete.

HYPNOTISM :
ITS HISTORY, PRACTICE, AND THEORY.
BY J. MILNE BRAMWELL, M.B., C.M.
800. 478 pages. 18.s. net.
The chief aim of this monograph is to draw the attention of medical men
to- the therapeutic value of Hypnotism. The author gives the results of
twelve years of his own practice and research, with personal observations
of the work done in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and
Belgium.
The historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively
little known work of the English pioneers, Elliotson, Esdaile, and Braid,
while the final chapter of references contains much information which has
not hitherto been published in accessible form.
The methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and
instructions given in regard to the management of the hypnotic state, with
details as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis. Hypnotic theories are
described and discussed, and special prominence is given to Mr. Myers's
theory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the
problems of hypnotism.

MEETINGS OF THE COUNCIL
THE 61st Meeting of the Council was held at 20 Hanover
Square, W., on Wednesday, July 29th, 1903, at 5.15 P.M.; Mr.
H. Arthur Smith in the Chair. There were also present : Mr.
W. W. Baggally, Mr. J. G. Piddington, Dr. C. Lloyd Tuckey and
Miss Alice Johnson, Secretary.
One new Member and seven new Associates were elected.
The election of six new Associates of the American Branch
was recorded. The names and addresses are given above.
Other formal business was transacted.
The 62nd Meeting of the Council was held in the same place
on Monday, November 2nd, 1903, at 3 P.M.; Professor W. F.
Barrett in the Chair. There were also present : Mr. W. W.
Baggally, the Hon. E. Feilding, Mr. F. N. Hales, Mr. J. G.
Piddington, Mr. F. Podmore, Mrs. Sidgwick, Mr. H. A. Smith,
Sir. A. K. Stepheuson, Lieut.-Colonel Taylor, Dr. C. L. Tuckey,
Mrs. Verrall, and Miss Alice Johnson, Secretary.
Eight new Members and eighteen new Associates were elected.
The election of one new Member and fourteen new Associates
of the American Branch was recorded. The names and addresses
are given above.
The monthly account for July, August, and September was
presented and read. The Treasurer observed that this was the
first time in the history of the Society that payment of a
Parochial Rate had been demanded. An appeal had been made
against it, and a certificate had now been obtained from the
Registrar of Friendly Societies that this Society is entitled to
the benefit of the Act 6 and 7 Viet. Cap. 36, which exempts
from County, Borough, Parochial and other Local Rates lands
and Buildings occupied by scientific or literary Societies.

• The Committee appointed on June 18th, 190.':!, to select an
Assistant Secretary reported that four candidates had applied
for the post, and that they had unanimously agreed to appoint
one of these, namely, Miss V. Larminie, who had worked as an
assistant in the office since October, 1902.
Jt was decided that the next Meeting of the Society should
be a Private Meeting for Members and Associates only, and
should be held on Monday, December 7th, 1903, when Mr.
Piddington would read a paper on " Types of Phenomena
exhibited in Mrs. Thompson's Trances."
GENERAL MEETING.
THE 121st General Meeting of the Society was held in the
large Hall at 20 Hanover Square, W., on Monday, November 2nd,
at 5 P.M. ; Sir William Crookes, F.K.S., in the Chair.
A paper on " Further Experiments on Dowsing, and some
Considerations thereon," illustrated by magic lantern slides, was
read by Professor W. F. P,arrett, F.R.S. It is hoped that the
paper will be published in the Proceedings, forming the third
Report on the so-called Dowsing Faculty. The following
memoranda, though not an abstract of the present, paper, give
in a compendious form the general conclusions arrived at by
Professor Barrett :
The investigations on which I have been engaged for several
years past have led me to the following conclusions, the evidence
for which is contained in the papers I have already published,
and in the paper to be read to-day :
1. A certain number of persons—say, one or two in every
score—have a marked idiosyncrasy, which manifests itself in
slight involuntary and unconscious muscular movements, usually
of the arms and hands. Doubtless all persons exhibit this to
a less degree.
2. These movements may be cultivated by repetition, by
expectant attention, and by inhibiting the conscious and voluntary
control of those particular muscles.
3. They are best revealed («) by the oscillations of the so-
called pendulc-explorateur, a ring or ball suspended from a thread
held between the thumb and finger ; and (b) by the motion of
DKC., 1903. General Meeting. 153
the so-called tlivininy or dowsing-rod, usually but not always
a forked twig, the branching ends being held one in each hand,
so that the whole is in somewhat unstable equilibrium.
4. These instruments, along with other less portable devices,
such as planchette, may be called autoscopes, as they reveal minute
automatic movements of the muscles.
5. Motor automatism, as this phenomenon is termed, is a reflex
action excited by some stimulus, derived either (i.) from a
dormant idea, or a sub-conscious suggestion, in the automatist's
own mind ; or (ii.) from a sub-conscious impression produced on
the automatist by an external object, or by an external mind.
The former create auto-suggestive, or auto-genous movements of
the autoscope ; the latter are hetero-siu/gestive movements.
6. Abundant evidence has been obtained, showing that the
sudden twisting of the dowsing rod may arise from both (i.) and
(ii.) Hence to infer, a priori, that the motion of the rod is due
to a particular stimulus, arising from the presence of underground
water, is absurd. Albeit this false inference is usually drawn by
professional dowsers, who thus sometimes lead the credulous into
very costly mistakes.
7. Underground water and metallic ores are often indicated
by surface signs, imperceptible to the ordinary observer, but
which become known to the experienced dowser. Such indica
tions, even when not consciously perceived, may create a sub
conscious impression on the dowser that will excite the automatic
motion of his rod (see 5, ii.). A plausible explanation of the
success achieved by some dowsers may thus be given.
8. But there are numerous cases where this explanation
completely breaks down, and yet the dowser, often an un
observant, ignorant man, has succeeded where the most skilful
observers have failed. Mere chance coincidence,—lucky hits,—
can also be shown to be wholly inadequate to account for these
successes.
9. Xor can we explain them by some electrical or other
known physical agency, or radio-active emanation, proceeding
from underground water or ores and detected by the dowser.
For dowsers are not peculiarly sensitive to such influences, and,
moreover, they have been successful in many other objects of
search besides water and ores. The true explanation is probably
154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DBC., 1903.
to be found in something new to science, which may be stated
as follows :
10. Amongst those who exhibit motor-automatism, a certain
proportion have a sub-conscious, supernormal perceptive faculty.
Any particular object sought for—it seems immaterial what that
object may be—excites an impression on the automatist when
he approaches it, though the object is usually out of sight, and
may be far beneath the surface of the ground.
11. This impression in most cases remains entirely sub
conscious, and is only revealed by its exciting the reflex that
moves the dowsing rod, or other portable autoscope ; not in
frequently, however, it reaches the level of an obscure sensation
or emotional disturbance, and in some cases it actually rises to
u conscious perception of the object sought for. In these latter
cases motor automatism may be absent.
12. A good dowser is, therefore, one who possesses this
supernormal perceptive power and instinctively allows it to be
operative when dowsing. Like other instinctive acts arising from
some unexplained perceptive faculty—such as the " homing " of
pigeons and of certain animals—the intrusion of reason or of
any conscious volition on the part of the dowser is prejudicial
or fatal to the end in view.
13. Hence for 250 years it has been noticed that children,
or simple country folk—children of Nature—whose minds are
free from preconceived ideas or reasoning, form the best dowsers,
being less liable to auto-suggestion.
14. When the normal self-consciousness is more or less in
abeyance, or when it is completely submerged, as in the
hypnotic state, we should expect to find this supernormal
perceptive power more apparent.
15. Inasmuch as something akin to an emotional disturbance
(see 11) is excited in the percipient by the discovery of the
object of his search, we should expect to find corresponding
changes in the circulation of his blood or in its arterial pressure.
Modern sensitive methods of detecting and registering these
changes might thus supersede the dowsing rod, and would in
any case form an interesting investigation for experimental
psychologists.
At the conclusion of the paper a discussion followed.
DEC., 1903. General Meeting. 155
LORD FARRER said that he had attended ou this occasion to
listen and not to speak, but that at the request of the Chairman
he would say a few words upon his own experience of dowsing.
He had been led to the study of the subject by an experiment
he had made with an old man in Sussex, who had taken to
dowsing, and although his own attitude had originally been one
of " philosophic doubt," the results of that experiment had cer
tainly been very curious. He had also experimented with the
Divining Rod himself, and had found, much to his horror at
the moment, that it moved in his own hands. He was not
quite convinced, however, that some physical cause might not
ultimately be found to account for the faculty. The best dowsers
that he had come across did not use rods, but divined through
sensations in their hands, and he thought this might well be a
subject for experiment by physiologists. Every one who had
travelled in uncivilised parts of the world was aware that horses,
when far from water, often possessed the power of tracking it.
Might not this power, in fact, be due to a lost sense—a sense
that had perhaps been common when its possession was more
necessary than at present, and which might have been lost
through disuse ? Another interesting point to note was with
regard to the sort of water found, which was not merely under
ground ivater, but an underground stream ; it appeared that it
must be moving water, and it was conceivable that the motion
might have some obscure effect on the human body.
MR. ANDHKW LANG said that personally he found the theory
of unconscious muscular action an unsatisfactory explanation of
the phenomena of dowsing, and certainly it was not a voluntary
action on the dowser's part that moved his rod. He had himself
experimented with a dowsing rod, and found that it moved in
his hands, entirely against his own will. He was, of course,
perfectly conscious of what he was doing, and did not for a
moment suppose that the stick was being pushed about by a
spirit. It was difficult to make those for whom the rod would
not work realise the feeling it produced. The power of find
ing water might, as Lord Farrer observed, be a primitive sense,
but the Australian blacks, many of whom inhabited almost water
less regions, did not, as far as was known, use divining rods,
though they could generally find whatever water existed—pro
bably as the result of long experience in searching for it.
156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1903.
DR. WYLD quoted a case of the failure of the water supply in
a large shooting in Buckinghamshire. The family had eventually
been compelled to try a dowser, who came down from Yorkshire,
and whom he (Dr. Wyld) had accompanied and observed closely
whilst he walked about the place. He carried the usual rod,
which he held by the two arms of the Y, and pointed with it
in front of him. At one point the tip of the rod bent at right
angles to the stem, so energetically that the rod broke. He was
practically certain that this had not been done by the man's
own muscular action.
MR. H. A. SMITH inquired how the breaking of the rod, which
undoubtedly takes place in some cases, could be accounted for
by unconscious muscular action.
MR. M. CRACKANTIIORPE asked whether it would not be
possible to invent some kind of electrical apparatus which
would be sensitive to underground streams.
MR. W. W. BAGGALLY asked whether it was likely that there
was any analogy between the action of the divining rod in rela
tion to underground water and an electrical apparatus which
has lately been invented for discovering minerals underground.
MR. F. 0. CONSTABLE proposed experimenting by means of an
underground pipe, through which water could be made to flow
or not at will.
SIR WILLIAM CROOKES said, in reply to Mr. Crackanthorpe's
question, that he had for many years been trying to find some
physical method of testing or measuring supernormal suscepti
bilities or capacities, but that so far he had entirely failed.
PROFESSOR BARRETT, replying to the various questions that
had been raised, said that the breaking of the rod which some
times occurred was probably due to one end being automatically
twisted by the dowser with one hand, whilst the other end was
held firmly in the other hand. With regard to the recently
invented apparatus for discovering underground metallic lodes by
their electrical conductivity, he believed that this had been used
successfully in some cases ; with underground water the con
ditions were different. Nevertheless, he had suggested that
method some years ago in a published paper as a method worth
trying. Experiments with underground water pipes had been
tried many times by different experimenters, as was recorded
in his own reports ; the dowser sometimes succeeded and some
DEC., 1903. General Meeting. 157
times failed in discovering whether any water was flowing through
the pipe or not ; but when he succeeded, it might conceivably be
explained by telepathy from the person who was managing the
intermittent flow. In the cases the speaker had cited in this and
preceding papers telepathy was, of course, excluded by the very
nature of the experiments, since no one knew whether water was
present or not, otherwise a dowser would not have been called in,
and it was this feature that made them at once so interesting
and so important. He had also, he said, tested dowsers in
order to ascertain whether they were specially sensitive to
electric influence or to the various sources of radio-activity, such
as the emanations from radium salts, etc., but had failed to dis
cover any susceptibilities of this kind. Further, he was con
vinced that no known perceptive power could explain this
alleged dowsing faculty ; hence the conclusion at which he had
arrived. Much more experimental evidence would, however, be
required before the explanation he had ventured to suggest would
be generally accepted by science.
CASE.
L. ll.°>4. Crystal vision.
THE following case was kindly obtained for us by an Associate
of the Society, the Kev. A. H. E. Lee, of 3 Cambrian Terrace,
Holbeck Moor, Leeds. The full names and addresses of the
witnesses were given to us, with a request not to print them.
It will be seen that the experience was of the nature of a
crystal vision, though the vision was seen in a glass of water.
The percipient, Mrs. H., writes :
LEEDS, May 26th, 1902.
On the night of April 16th I retired to bed feeling unusually
depressed, placing a glass of water on the table for drinking during
the night. My husband was on night duty at the time on the
L.N.W. line. I awoke with a start about three o'clock in the
morning, and feeling thirsty, reached out of bed for the water ;
when about to partake of it, I saw, to my surprise, a moving
picture in the glass, comprising waggons, and in the rear a guard
van ; as I looked they all appeared to smash into each other, and
I noticed the van in particular was the most damaged. My husband
158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1903.
came home about two hours later and told me that he passed the
scene of the accident, and that the guard was seriously injured. I
regard the above as something more than a mere coincidence.
Mr. H. writes :
I am a Goods Inspector on the L.N.W. Railway, and was
travelling with a goods train to Manchester on the night of April
16th, 1902, and, after passing Ashton at 3.10 a.m. on the 17th, I
passed the scene of an accident, which had occurred to our Leeds
to London express goods train on the Micklehurst New Line, near
Staley and Millbrook Station. It was distinctly visible to me and
the goods guard I was travelling with, as the breakdown gang
was out and large fires burning. On my returning from Man
chester, I passed over the scene of the accident, and saw the
waggons and guard's van, the latter being very badly damaged ;
that was about 7.50 a.m. April Nth. On my reaching home, my
wife told me of the vision she had seen.
The following are questions addressed by Mr. Lee to
Mrs. H., with her answers appended, received by us on June
30th, 1902:
(1) Why were you depressed ? Did you connect your depression
with your husband 1
sins. I was depressed on account of the child's illness, and
worried owing to my husband's absence from home at such a time ;
upon seeing the vision, I at once thought of my husband and
wondered if he was safe.
(2) Did you see the time, or how did you know ?
Ans. At that time I lifted the clock off the mantel and placed
it on the table, where I could see it without rising.
(3) Do you generally have water at your side ?
Ans. Every night, as the little girl generally asks for water
during the night.
(4) Was the room lighted, or how did you see the picture 1
Ans. The gas was left burning, turned low, and there was a
bright fire, as owing to the sickness it was always kept in.
(5) Did the whole train seem to smash up ?
Ans. When I saw the picture, there appeared to be a few
waggons and a guard's van ; they all seemed to smash into each
other.
(6) What time did your husband come home 1
Ans. About nine o'clock in the morning.
DEC., 1903. Case. 159
(7) Had you connected the vision with him, and felt anxious on
that account 1
Ans. Yes.
(8) Did he tell you first, or you him t
Aiis. I told him first, and to my surprise he knew of the
accident.
(9) Do you often have similar experiences and warnings 1
Ans. Very often, especially before sickness.
(10) Have you ever heard of crystal-gazing?
Ans. Yes, but I have never looked through one.
In answer to further questions from us, Mr. H. wrote on
August IHth, 1902 :
In answer to your letter of 16th ulto., I have been unavoidably
busy or would have replied sooner.
(1) I was about a quarter of a mile from the scene of the
accident when I passed at 3 a.m., and saw the men working on
the line, there being great fires burning and numerous lanterns,
but could not distinguish anything else distinctly.
(2) The accident occurred at about 10 p.m.
(3) I passed the scene a second time at 7.50 the next morning,
and saw the break van and one or two waggons whioh had been
in the collision, and all very much broken up.
Thus it appears that at the time when Mrs. H. saw the
vision, her husband had only seen that there was an accident,
the details of which were indistinguishable to him, and it was
not until about five hours later that he actually witnessed
the details, which corresponded fairly closely to Mrs. H.'s
vision. His connection with railway affairs would be likely
to make his recollection of the times especially accurate ;
so that at first sight there might seem to be some difficulty
in explaining the case by telepathy from him to his wife.
We have to consider, however, that t>he mere knowledge that
an accident had taken place would inevitably call up in the
mind—especially of a railway man—some impression of the
details of the scene, which would be more or less in
accordance with the facts ; and it is not clear that Mrs. H.'s
vision accorded with them more closely than would such an
impression. Thus the details of her vision might well have
been derived from the impression produced in his mind on
first passing the scene.
160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1903.
UNPREJUDICED TESTIMONY.
A CORRESPONDENT has sent us the following example of wide
divergences in the evidence of two eye-witnesses of the same
event—an event in which they were apparently only interested
as spectators, having no theory to support about it.
The accounts are taken from the Daily Chronicle of Novem
ber fith, 190o, and relate to the recent murders of Armenians
at Peckham, Account (A) is as follows :
(1) Yesterday ... a party of eight Huntschakisti ventured out
of doors from their headquarters practically for the first time since
their comrade was slain at Nunhead-grove. . . . The assassin, after
returning from his preliminary tour of inspection, loitered about on the
footpath for some time. Then he disappeared only, as it was after
wards shown, to take shelter in the open right-of-way of No. 45,
where he was tolerably safe from observation. About the time the
assassin took up his station, the eight members of the Huntchakisti
party had started on their homeward journey. The narrow dimen
sions of the footpath did not permit of their walking abreast, so
they split up into three groups. In the foremost group were two
delegates from Russia. They were nearly forty yards in advance of
the second group, which consisted of Aram Grigorian, aged twenty-
five, Tigran Izmirian, thirty-two, and a third Huntschakist named
Karapitian. The remainder of the party sauntered slowly along
some hundred yards in the rear of the second group. It was the
members of this second group that were attacked by the hiding
assassin. Grigorian was walking on the side nearest the right-of-
way, and as far as can at present be ascertained, Karapitian was in
the middle, while Izmirian was nearest the gutter. The first group
passed the murderer's hiding place safely. Why the assassin did not
fire upon them is not quite clear, unless it be that it was the mem
bers of the second group and none other he wished to assassinate.
(2) As Grigorian and his comrades passed the right-of-way which
gives access to No. 43, the murderer took a couple of steps forward,
which brought him from the shelter of the fence on to the footway.
His victims were then some six paces in front of him. They were
walking abreast, and had not observed the murderer's stealthy
spring.
(3) Suddenly, producing a bright, new-looking nickel-plated six-
chambered revolver from his pocket, he levelled the weapon and fired
point blank at Grigorian, who was nearest to him.
DRC., 1903. Unprejudiced Testimony. 1CI
(4) There was a sharp crack as the pistol went ofl', and next
moment, the first victim, who had both hands thrust deep in his
coat pockets, pitched forward upon his face, where he lay lifeless
with a bullet through his brain.
(5) The murderer's shooting was extremely rapid. Almost before
the dead man's companions had recovered from their surprise he
had fired two shots at Karapitian, who was walking in the middle.
Both shots missed, singularly enough. Karapitian, who was unarmed
and unable to meet the assassin on equal terms, sprang away and
succeeded in escaping.
(6) The luckless Izmirian was not so fortunate. Upon him tilt-
murderer now turned the still smoking weapon. He fired but one
shot at him. This took effect in the back of the head, about
the base of the skull, and proved instantly fatal. In falling.
Izmirian turned half round and lay beside his dead comrade, the
feet of both men facing the gutter. When the murderer had finished
his last victim he turned and attempted to escape.
(7) The first group of delegates hearing the shooting, turned round
and witnessed the murder of their comrades. For a moment they
were spellbound with horror. Then one of their number named
Taslurian rushed back, hoping to grapple with the assassin. With
him went M. Karapitian, who luckily escaped the assassin's bullets
when he opened fire in the first instance. But before the two men
could reach the scene of the tragedy the murderer had turned and
was fleeing for his life. But his flight was speedily cut short and
his life brought to an abrupt termination by his own hand. The
tragedy was witnessed by at least half-a-dozen persons, exclusive of
the Armenians themselves.
(8) One of the spectators acted with commendable promptitude.
This was a young man named John Jarvis, who happened to be in
the yard of No. 43 Peckham-rye, and within a few yards of the
fence where the murderer had been in hiding. Jarvis jumped over
the fence of No. 43 on to the footpath when he heard the sounds
of the shooting.
(9) Yet so quick had the assassin acted that the two men were
already dead, and the murderer was fleeing when Jarvis reached the
scene. Jarvis made a rush at him, and both cannoned. The
impact was disastrous to the assassin, for it brought him to the
ground.
(10) Jarvis sprang upon him, grasping the revolver which he still
gripped in his right hand. He had no sooner gained possession of
162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., luos.
the weapon than the murderer, who by this time had assumed a
sitting position, slipped his left hand into his left side trousers
pocket and produced a second, and practically similar weapon.
(11) In less time than it takes to relate, he had placed the muzzle
of the weapon close behind his right ear and had blown out his
brains.
(12) A police constable who arrived upon the scene at this junc
ture took the revolver from the hands of the murderer. It was
found to be a six-chambered weapon, nickel-plated, and was loaded
in five chambers. . ,
ACCOUNT B.
Story of an Eye-Witness.
An eye-witness of the tragedy, who was standing close to the
murdered men when they were attacked, has given a vivid descrip
tion of the scene to one of our representatives :
(I)1 I was standing on the Triangle about twenty minutes past
three (he said), when three men came along, and my mate said,
"Look! there are three of these foreigners." I said, "Yes; I know
them ; I saw them at the inquest on Sagouni." My mate went
away, and the three foreigners came strolling slowly along, walking
in the direction of their club at 85 Peckham-rye. They got in front
of me, and, as I was curious about them, I followed close behind.
I noticed that they were looking anxiously about them, peering into
omnibuses and cabs, as if they were watching for some one.
(2) I kept about half-a-dozen yards behind them, and just as they
crossed Phillip Road a man jostled me, accidentally I think, and as
if he had stumbled on the kerb.
(3) I said something about being more careful, but he took no
notice, and just at that moment I saw him draw a revolver. He
shot the middle man of the three behind the ear.
(4) The wounded man fell in a heap on the roadway, and his two
companions wheeled round and faced the assailant.
(5) The assassin let his revolver go at another of the men, the
one nearest him, but missed him, (6) and I then quite clearly saw
him put his hand into one of his pockets and draw out a second
revolver, which he discharged at the third man. This man also fell
in a heap, and the murderer at once made as if to go up Phillip
Road, but mistook the turning and ran into Sam Earl's yard. Any
one who did not know the neighbourhood well would mistake that
DEC., 1903. Unprejudiced Testimony. 163
for a thoroughfare, as the houses at the end of it are about fifty
yards from the entrance.
(9) As the murderer turned into the yard he stumbled and fell,
and, while lying on the ground, (10) he fired a second shot at the
man whom he had already missed.
(11) Again he missed him, and then, seeing a lot of people running
towards him, he raised his revolver and shot himself as he lay on
the ground.
(12) The man who had been fired at twice and missed came up
at that moment, and took the murderer's revolver out of his hand.
These accounts have been divided into numbered items for
convenience of comparison. It may be noticed that :
(1) Account (A) mentions eight Huntschakisti ; (B) gives
only three, having apparently failed to notice the first and last
group. This, however, is hardly an actual discrepancy, but
seems to be simply an omission—a failure of observation.
(2) Account (A) describes the assassin as emerging from the
inner side of the pathway. In (B) he seems to come from the
outer side, as he appeared to the witness to stumble on the kerb.
(3) Account (A) says he shot the man who was nearest to
him of the three ; (B) says he shot the middle man of the three.
(4) Account (B) says the two others then wheeled round
and faced him. (A) is not quite explicit on this point, but
from the description in (5) of Karapitian running away, and
in (6) of Izmirian half turning round as he fell after being
shot, it appears that neither of the two turned round to face
the murderer.
(5) Account (A) states that the second man who was shot
at was the middle one ; two shots were tired ; (B) describes one
shot at the nearest man.
(6) Account (A) states that the next shot, made with the
same revolver, was fired at the third man, Izmirian, proving
instantly fatal ; (B) says, " I quite clearly saw him put his
hand into one of his pockets and draw out a second revolver,
which he discharged at the third man," and then describes his
running away.
(7) Account (A) says that the first group of Huntschakisti
hearing the shooting, turned round, and one of them, with the
third man Karapitian, who had escaped the bullets, ran back
to secure the assassin. This is entirely omitted in 13.
164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1903.
(8) Account (A) gives the exploit of John Jarvis, who also
attempted to catch the murderer. This too is omitted in B.
(9) Account (A) states that Jarvis, rushing at the murderer,
brought him to the ground; (B) says that as he turned into
the yard, he stumbled and fell.
(10) Account (A) says that Jarvis took away his first re
volver, and he then, sitting on the ground, produced a second
revolver from his pocket. This second revolver is stated in
(B) to have been brought out at an earlier stage (see B. 6.),
and to have been used in firing at Karapitian. Account (B)
also says that at this point he fired a second shot at Karapitiau.
(11) Account (A) says that on taking the second revolver
out of his pocket, he immediately turned it on himself. (B)
says that this was only done after missing Karapitiau a second
time, and describes the pursuit of the murderer as only be
ginning just before he shot himself.
(12) Account (A) says that a police constable who arrived
immediately after the suicide, took the revolver from the hands
of the murderer ; (B) says that Karapitian came up at this
moment and took the revolver from him.
One or other of these accounts then, if not both, must be
grossly inaccurate in detail ; yet both were apparently given
by eye-witnesses, and certainly within a few hours of the
event, and probably in all good faith.
A very frequent complaint alleged against our Society is that
reports of such occurrences as spiritualistic seances are treated
with undue scepticism ; but a study of reports of events of
almost any kind will show how ditticult it is to give accurate
descriptions, and consequently how necessary it is to exercise
caution in regard to them. In the present case, the occur
rence took place in broad daylight : the spectators had not
had their senses confused and their imaginations stimulated
by a long wait in darkness ; there was nothing that
they were especially expecting or desiring to see, and no one to
suggest to them what was happening or likely to happen. We
do not perhaps often find such striking discrepancies in
reports of seances ; but in considering how far the witnesses
agree in the latter case, it is important to observe whether or
not they have compared notes before reporting, and so brought
into agreement recollections which were at first discordant.

HYPNOTISM :
ITS HISTORY, PRACTICE, AND THEORY.
BY J. MILNE BRAMWELL, M.B., C.M.
8«o. 478 par/in. IS*, net.
The chief aim of this monograph is to draw the attention of medical men
to the therapeutic value of Hypnotism. The author gives the results of
twelve years of his own practice and research, with personal observations
(pf the work done in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and
Belgium.
The historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively
little known work of the English pioneers, Elliotaon, Esdaile, and Braid,
while the final chapter of references contains much information which has
not hitherto been published in accessible form.
The methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and
instructions given in regard to the management of the hypnotic state, with
details as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis. Hypnotic theories are
described and discussed, and special prominence is given to Mr. Myers's
theory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the
problems of hypnotism.

MEETING OF THE COUNCIL
THE 63rd Meeting of the Council was held at 20 Hanover
Square, W., on Monday, December 7th, 1903, at 2.45 P.M.; the
President in the Chair. There were also present : Mr. W. W.

It was agreed that the Annual General Meeting of
Members of the Society should be held on January 29th,
1904, at 4.30 P.M., immediately before the Council meeting
on the same day, and that the next General Meeting of the
Society should be held on the evening of the same day,
at 8.30.
PRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.
THE sixth of the series of Private Meetings for Members and
Associates only was held in the Large Hall at 20 Hanover
Square, London, W., on Monday, December 7th, 1903, at
4.15 P.M.; the President, Sir Oliver Lodge, in the chair.
MR. J. G. PIDDINGTON read some extracts from his paper
on " The Types of Phenomena displayed in Mrs. Thompson's
Trance," which will appear immediately in the Proceedings,
and is therefore not summarised here.
THE PRESIDENT remarked that one of the most interesting
types of phenomena was the occasional coincidences between
the trance experiences of Mrs. Thompson and those of other
mediums at a distance from her, e.g. when " Nelly " (Mrs.
Thompson's control) said she had visited " Miss Rawson " (who
was then in the South of France) on the day on which Mr.
1 68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1904.
Myers had recorded that " Miss Eawson " had been possessed
by a soi-disant Mrs. Thompson.
MR. THURSTAN said that he was acquainted with many
instances of predictions made by Mrs. Thompson which had
been fulfilled.
MR. THOMPSON said that " Nelly " had made a good many
predictions relating to trivial matters, some of which had been
fulfilled, and some not ; but as he had not kept complete
records of all the predictions, he did not feel himself justified
in proffering them as evidence, the more so as he was unable
to state what proportion had been fulfilled.
MR. Hu.ME-RoTHERY thought the suspicious side of trance
communications deserved great attention. For instance, Pro
fessor Hyslop's sittings with Mrs. Piper would have had much
evidential value for personal identity but for two things.
When the control professed to be quite clear, much non-
evidential matter was given fluently ; but as soon as an attempt
was made to give evidential matter, hesitation ensued. This
latter would appear to need no more clearness of intellect
than the former, but did need a knowledge of the facts.
Again, many details were given as to a relation of Professor
Hyslop ; these were found to apply not to him but to a man of
the same name—quite unrelated—who had lived in the same
county and whose name figured in a local history. These
points raised a strong presumption against the communications
coming from the sources alleged. The speaker knew of a case
where, after various communicators had alleged their presence
and evidential matter had been given, the sitter charged
the control with personation in consequence of a false answer.
After a spirited defence, the charge being still persisted in,
the control stated that it had personated all the alleged
communicators.
THE PRESIDENT said he quite agreed with the last speaker
as to the necessity for caution in the treatment of all alleged
communications, and the difficulty both of disentangling the
evidential from the non-evidential matter, and of finding the
true interpretation even of the evidential matter. It was
these difficulties which had so long stood in the way of any
elucidation of the problems involved and which enforced on
us still an attitude of suspended judgment. Had the subject
JAN., 1904. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 169
been an easy one, it would have been assimilated by the human
race long ago. In particular it was highly desirable that no
one should either be perturbed, or should act against his judg
ment, on account of predictions or any other class of communi
cations received in this way.
PROFESSOR SIMON NEWCOMB OX " THE GEORGIA
MAGNET."
THE following letter from Sir Oliver Lodge appeared in the
Literary Supplement of "The Times" of November 27th, 1903,
under the heading, " The Late Mr. Myers and Credulity."
To THE EDITOR OF "THE TIMES."
SIR,—I observe that the concluding portion of a book entitled
" Reminiscences of an Astronomer," by Professor Simon Newcomb,
has led many reviewers to draw the natural inference that the late
F. W. H. Myers and the Society for Psychical Research were misled
into supposing that the ingenious mechanical tricks of a person called
by her exploiters " the little Georgia Magnet," some years ago were
attributable to supernormal power; and that they are publishing
this inference as if it were true.
Will you allow me, therefore, in justice to the memory of my
friend, to assert that it is simply false, and that the Society reported
against anything but simple mechanics in that case from the first 1
Yours faithfully,
OLIVER LODGE.
THE UNIVERSITY, BIRMINGHAM, Nov. 24.
A full account of the performances of Mrs. Abbott, known
as the " Little Georgia Magnet," is to be found in Mr. Myers's
paper on " Resolute Credulity," in the Proceedings S.P.R., Vol.
XL, pp. 219-225, published in 1895. Mrs. Abbott used to
give public exhibitions, showing feats of strength of a re
markable and at first sight inexplicable kind. These had been
described in an article by Dr. Henri Goudard in the Jan.-
Feb., 1895, number of the Annales des Sciences Psychiquts,
and consisted of such feats as the following : " The
operator stands on one foot holding a billiard cue, while a
tall, strong man is then asked to push her backwards by
steady pressure on the cue, and fails." " She presents her
elbows to a person standing behind her, and requests to be
170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1904.
lifted by them. Sometimes she can thus be lifted, sometimes
she cannot," thus showing an apparent alteration in weight.
" The apparent difficulty of being lifted is transmitted to another
person." " Five or six persons are sitting or sprawling on a
chair, which the operator then momentarily raises or jerks for
an instant from the floor." The mechanism of these and
similar feats were explained by Sir Oliver Lodge in a state
ment which Mr. Myers quotes. Sir Oliver Lodge visited Mrs.
Abbott's exhibition more than once, and also had a private
interview with her, and tried experiments with other people of
suitable size. He concluded that the feats were ingeniously
chosen to suit a short person, and that Mrs. Abbott, though
small and frail in appearance, was probably muscular, at any
rate in the arms. He had previously given a similar and
entirely normal explanation of the case at a meeting of the
Society held on December 4th, 1891, and reported in the
Journal, Vol. V., pp. 167-169.
In his article, Mr. Myers quotes also (from the Rdii)io-
Philosophical Journal) an account of Mrs. Abbott's perform
ances by the Kev. Solon Laner, and refers to a report by Dr.
Hodgson and another by Professor J. H. Hyslop, who himself
succeeded in repeating almost all Mrs. Abbott's tricks.
Sir Oliver Lodge did not consider that there was anything
in her performance of a deliberately fraudulent kind, but simply
regarded it as an exhibition of well-chosen feats of strength
and skill, with no more deception than a conjuror may legiti
mately practise. It appears, however, that when Dr. Hodgson
saw her in Boston in 1889, the exhibition was, he thought,
more definitely spiritualistic, and therefore, under the circum
stances, more definitely fraudulent than it became later,—when
she trusted perhaps rather to the interpretations of inexpert
observers than to any explicit statements to produce the im
pression that her performances were in some way supernormal.
There is thus no possible excuse for suggesting that the
Society at any time took this view of her, and any person who
is unacquainted with Mr. Myers's attitude towards fraudulent
phenomena in general is recommended to read the article on
" Eesolute Credulity " above referred to, as well as the references
in his book to similar topics (see, e.g.. Human Personality, Vol.
II., pp. 206 and 501-503).
JAN., 1904. The " Wasting Loaves" at Raikes Farm. 171
THE "WASTING LOAVES" AT RAIKES FAKM,
BEVERLEY.
.DURING the past autumn accounts under the above, or a like,
heading have appeared in several newspapers. Thus the Daily
Express for August 24th, 1903, says:—
Mr. and Mrs. Webster of Raikes Farm have for three months
been perturbed by a strange fate which has befallen their supply
of bread. Morning after morning they came down to find the
loaves they left in the bread-pan, some diminished in size, others
with crusts taken off, some more with holes through them, and yet
no signs of crumbs or of mice or of human handling.
Other accounts are given in the same paper for August 81st,
and October 13th and 15th, 1903. The Miller for September
7th, 1903, contains a report by ex-Police-constable R. Berridge,
of Bishop Burton, who was employed by the Websters to stay
in the house, and take sole charge of the dairy. This report,
dated August 15th, 1903, is as follows:—
I, Richard Berridge, ex-Police-constable, residing at Bishop Burton,
do hereby state that on August 11, 1903, I was employed by Mr.
Webster, of Kaikes Farm, to take charge of the dairy, with a view of
trying to find out who it was that was wasting bread, as the waste
has been going on since the first week in March. On the llth inst.
I went to Raikes Farm, taking with me two loaves of bread which
I bought at Beverley the previous night. I placed them in the
dairy, and they appeared to keep all right, but I may say there
was some bread in another part of the house which was wasting
away. On the 13th inst. I cut the top off one of the loaves which
I had taken up with me, and to my surprise there was a hole
through the centre of the loaf to the bottom, and the hole got
larger and larger. No. 2 loaf which I took with me wasted in
the dairy. On the 12th inst. I placed five new loaves of bread,
which were baked in the house, in the dairy in a pancheon, and it
appeared to keep all right till the following day. It was all right
at 10 a.m., but when I examined it at 12 noon, to my surprise,
the top of one loaf the whole length had disappeared, and the other
loaves were wasting, some more than others. Now I have had
this bread locked up with my own lock which I bought, and I have
placed bread in secret places in the house known only to myself,
and still it wasted away, and, strange to say, although there is so
172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., i»o».
much bread wasted, there are no crumbs left in the pancheon. I
am at a loss to know the reason of this bread wasting, but of one
thing I am convinced, no human hands are doing it, and I must
leave the mystery to be solved by an abler person than myself.—
(Signed) R. BERRIDGB.
Eaikes Farm is in the village of Bishop Burton on the York
shire Wolds a little to the west of Beverley. Mr. Webster (who
has now left) was then the hind, or bailiff, who occupied and
worked the farm under the tenant ; and his household consisted
of himself, his wife, wife's mother, seven children, and ten farm
hands. We asked Mr. E. Westlake to look into the matter,
and he went to the Express office and saw their reporter, Mr.
Quiim, who had just returned from the farm and who gave
him an account of the investigation which he had carried out
with the help of Mr. Pearman, the Vicar of Bishop Burton.
Mr. Westlake's notes of this account were subsequently sub
mitted to Mr. Quinn, who writes, December 10th, 1903:—
" Save in the .one or two instances in which I have made
corrections, your notes, so far as they go, are quite accurate."
The notes revised by Mr. Quinn are as follows :—
[Information received on October 20th, 1903, from Mr. D. J. Quinn,
reporter, Daily Express Office, Tudor Street, E.G.].
I went to Kaikes Farm during the week ending October 17th,
1903. Mr. and Mrs. Webster gave me every information. One
night, Mr. Pearman, myself, and Mr. Webster sat up all night with
the bread, but nothing happened. In the morning the bread was
taken to the kitchen for breakfast, and a few minutes later Mrs.
Webster came running out with a loaf, from the bottom of which
a piece had been torn off. We asked who had been in the kitchen,
and Mr. and Mrs. Webster replied, only themselves and their
daughter (aged between 18 and 19), who aids in the housework.
Bread placed in a locked cupboard in the dining-room was un
touched. The door of the cupboard was then unlocked.
During the afternoon, when I had gone out to the village, Mr.
Pearman said he was tired and would take a nap. tie looked at
the bread in the cupboard, which was all right. He went into the
parlour, drew down the blind, lay down on a couch, and drew a
cloak over his face, but did not go to sleep. The parlour door
was open, andi was opposite to the door of the dining room on the
other side of the passage.
JAN., 1904. The " Wasting Loaves" at Haikex Farm. 173
Mr. Peannan then heard Mrs. Webster come into the dining
room and walk round the table clearing away the things ; he could
hear she did not go to the cupboard.
Afterwards he heard the eldest daughter enter the dining room
and go to the cupboard and place something in it (sounded like
knives or spoons). She stayed there about a minute and a half.
She then left the room. Mr. Pearman at once got up and went to
the cupboard, and found that a piece had been torn off the loaf.
When I returned, Mr. Pearman told me the above, and we thought,
in view of the trouble the matter was causing to Mr. and Mrs.
Webster, that we ought to represent to them that the circumstances
pointed to the possibility of their daughter being concerned in it.
They, however, repudiated this suggestion altogether, and said it was
worse than the previous mystery.
In regard to the experiments made previous to my arrival, I
found that the larder is divided by a wooden partition and door
(which could be locked) made of vertical bars or strips of wood. I
found I could thrust my hands between the bars to some distance
above the wrists, and that when a loaf was placed on a shelf near
the partition, I could hold it with one hand and tear off a piece
with the other. I drew the girl's attention to this, and asked her
to try, but she declined, saying, "Oh, sir, I should not like to!"
Her arms were thinner than mine. Bread placed on the shelves too
far from the partition to be reached in this way had not been
touched.
The girl was the first up in the morning, and Mr. Webster in the
experiments he had made had allowed her access to the bread equally
with himself, and she may very well have been the first to handle
it. The Websters apparently never thought of suspecting her, and I
think that all the experiments where the bread had " wasted " have
been vitiated by this circumstance.
I had not heard of the experiment with the "poisoned loaf,"
which was not touched when the others were, as described by Mr.
Webster in the Express of August 24th, but he would no doubt
have told his daughter which it was.
Mr. Westlake adds :—
I questioned Mr. Quinn in regard to the loaf described by P.O.
Berridge, where he says he cut the top off one of the loaves, and
was surprised to find a hole through the centre. Mr. Quinn said
that he did not think that this implied (as I thought it did) that
the hole had no external aperture ; and that probably the loaf was
174 Journal of Society jjor Psychical Research. JAN., 1904.
in the same condition as the one he had seen brought from the
kitchen (described above) in which the hole originated from the
bottom ; and that Berridge might have cut his loaf without noticing
that there was a hole in the bottom.
Mr. Quinn's description of the larder, which is the place
described as the dairy by Mr. Berridge, shows that the pre
cautions taken by the latter to guard it were probably in
adequate. We wrote to Mr. Berridge, asking whether he had
witnessed anything which he was sure could not have been
done by a member of the family, but no reply has been
received.
Mr. Quinn's report of his observations was sent to the
Daily Ejyrcss, but was not published by them.
We ought to add that Mr. Pearman has not explicitly
admitted the accuracy of Mr. Quinn's account, given above,
which we sent to him asking for his corroboration. His
letters, however, implied that he shared Mr. Quinn's general
view of the case. In reply to a second letter, asking for a
statement of the facts, he wrote :—•
BISHOP BURTON, BEVERLEY, YORKSHIRE, Dec. 8th, 1903.
DEAR SIR,
If you will send for a Be.terky Guardian, published on
Saturday last in Beverley, you will perhaps be satisfied that there
is nothing of use to your Society in the Raikes mystery.
The farm is in this parish. The Websters have left ; but as a
clergyman I refuse to tell you the facts, beyond assuring you the
supernatural has had nothing to do with the bread disappearing.
Yours faithfully, W. A. PEARMAN.
We find that the Beverley Guardian for December 5th,
190:5, has the following:—
This is the first occasion upon which a single word of the so-called
mystery of the disappearing bread at Raikes Farm, Bishop Burton,
has appeared in our columns, while other newspapers, far and near,
have " written it up " over and over again. The reason for us having
adopted this course is that we have known for some months that
the " mystery " was really no mystery at all, but that the cause of
the disappearance was known to the tenant of the farm (Mr. R. Fisher,
of Leconfield) and others, and that it would end when a change of
bailiffs came to be made. This is now fully borne out by the fact
that since the new bailiff, Mr. Walker, entered into occupation of
JAN., 1904. The " Wasting Loaves " at Raikes Farm. 175
the premises a fortnight ago, no bread whatever has disappeared or
been affected in any way.
Mr. Quinn writes, December 10th, 1903 :—
I am not surprised that Mr. Pearman should refuse to assist you.
He urged me to let the matter drop, and, without telling me of it,
went so far as to telegraph to the Editor to the same effect, assert
ing "that the matter was too dangerous" to risk its publication.
Thus it was that the solution of the " mystery " did not appear in
the Express, though the North Mail (Newcastle) published my account
just as I wired it.
This account, which Mr. Westlake did not see till after he
had written out his notes of Mr. Quinn's statement to him on
December 20th, appears as follows in the North Mail for
October 17th, 1903:—
The mystery of the dwindling bread of Raikes Farm, Beverley,
entered upon a new phase yesterday. It had reached a point when,
in the interests of a father and a mother driven to the verge of
distraction, a serious attempt should be made to elucidate it.
A story had gained currency which promised to earn for Raikes
Farm an honoured place in the history of the haunted homes of
England. It was that of a starving beggar who, many years ago, was
said to have been found dead in an adjoining wood after being refused
assistance at the farm, who was now exacting from Webster a belated
revenge for the uncharitableness of a former occupant.
In these circumstances the North Mail representative, with the
full concurrence of the parties immediately concerned, undertook,
with the assistance of the Rev. W. Pearman, Vicar of Bishop
Burton, to lay the ghost. Having procured a number of loaves in
the village, the Vicar and Webster spent Thursday night in a close
watch upon the bread, which, with two loaves of the Websters, five
in all, was distributed in the dairy and adjoining rooms. Portions of
a fourth loaf were, unknown to the Websters, placed in the kitchen.
Webster, with the hospitality characteristic of Yorkshiremen, in
sisted upon keeping his guests company in their long vigil. Fatigued
with his hard day's work, however, he was induced to stretch him
self on a sofa, where he slumbered fitfully. Only the rain without
and the loud ticking of a trio of clocks within disturbed the mid
night calm.
One strained one's ears in vain for a note of music or a footfall
on the stairs or floor above, but the ghost did not walk.
176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1904.
A careful inspection of the loaves at dawn showed them to have
been untouched, not a crumb was missing.
" But they will go," persisted the Websters, " watch them for a
day or two." The watch was maintained more or less closely
throughout the day with results that left no doubt in the watchers'
minds that the dwindling of the Websters' loaves for the past seven
months was not the work of the starving beggar's ghost.
At 6.30 the first manifestation of wasting appeared in the kitchen
on the end of a loaf which a few minutes before had been handed
to Mrs. Webster intact for use on the breakfast table.
The second and third manifestations appeared in the afternoon—
one on a loaf purposely placed within arm's reach inside the railings
of the dairy, the other on a loaf placed on a shelf of a cupboard in
the dining room, the doors of which were left unlocked.
Bread locked away beyond arm's reach remained intact. No one
was actually seen to touch the loaves, but there was a strong
suspicion that it was not Webster nor his wife. They acted most
straightforwardly and hospitably throughout, and it is perhaps to
their credit as parents that they resented any suspicion being cast
upon their daughter.
The daughter, a quiet girl of perhaps seventeen or eighteen years
of age, is a hard worker, and her parents know of no reason,
mentally or physically, why such strange behaviour should be
attributed to her. As for the noises said to have been heard in
the house, it is not improbable that they, too, are capable of a
rational explanation.
The tenant, Mr. Robert Fisher, a well-known breeder, wrote
to Mr. Westlake in confidence his opinion of the matter on
Oct. 24th. In a subsequent letter he says :—
LKCONFIKLD, BEVERLEY, December 8th, 1903.
Since the Websters left the farm there has been no more bread
mystery; they have taken the ghosts, microbes, etc., with them.
Bread has been put in exactly the same place by the new people,
and up to date nothing interferes with it (or no person). ... I still
hold to my former opinion that in the first [instance] it was a case
of hysteria, since the press and the public have made such a fuss
about it ; I think they (the Websters) had other motives, seeing that
hundreds of people have visited the farm and given useful tips and
paid fees to see the wonderful bread. . . .

JAN., 1904. Case. 177
CASE
L. L135. Dream.
The following case was sent to us by an Associate of the
Society, Mr. F. C. Constable, of Wick Court, near Bristol, on
April 2nd, 1903. The first letter was written to Mr.
Constable's cook, Miss Julia Cox, by her sister, Mrs. Hope,
as follows :
49 MAYBRICK ROAD,
[Postmark, "BATH, 10 p.m., April 1.03."]
MY DEAR SISTER,—I am sending you the copy from the Bible
which I hope will be all right. I hope you will not mind my not
coming down, but if this is not satisfactory let me know and I
will come and bring the Bible with me. I shall come down after
Easter without fail if all is well. It was very strange, but I
dreamt Monday night [apparently the night of March 30th] that
you came here and wanted the Bible, as you thought you would
take greater care of it than I. I had told Bob about my dream
before I had your letter. . . . [Signed] F. HOPE.
In answer to Mr. Constable's request for corroboration,
Mr. Hope wrote to him :
49 MAYBRICK ROAD, OLDFIKLD PARK.
[Postmark, "BATH,"] April 6 [1903].
DEAR SIR,—In answer to your request with reference to my wife's
dream, I hereby state that my wife had gone to the theatre with
a friend. On going to the front door I looked behind as I some
times do, to see if there were any letters. I found one from my
wife's sister, Julia. As we had received one from her only a day
or two before, I thought something must be the matter, so I opened
it and found it was a request from her for particulars of her birth
entry in a family Bible. I hunted about and found it in a box of
old books that had come from the old home. When my wife came
in she saw the Bible, and said as soon as she got inside the door,
"What have you got that old Bible for? I was dreaming about it
last night. I dreamed that Julia wanted it to get her birth entry
from it." I had not had even a chance to speak to her before she
got that out, nor had she seen the letter, because I had put it
behind the tea-box on the mantel-shelf where we usually put our
letters after reading them.
17H Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAV., 1904.
I was so much struck with the remarkable coincidence that I told
my fellow-workmen about it in the morning.
[Signed] R. H. HOPK.
P.S.—I forgot to say that Julia's letter got destroyed by accident.
R. H. H.
Mr. Constable writes, enclosing this letter:
WICK COURT, NEAR BRISTOL, 1th April, 1903.
... I think (from what I hear, not what I know) that Mr.
Hope's statement is accurate, and his wife's not so accurate— if, as I
think, there is contradiction. But these letters show how utterly
untrustworthy human memory is in detail. But memory as to gen
eral truth I would suggest is trustworthy. For instance, in this
<:ase something did occur which struck those concerned as exceptional.
F. C. CONSTABLK.
The following statement was written by Mrs. Constable,
from Miss Cox's dictation, and signed as correct by the latter :
WICK COURT, NEAR BRISTOL.
I went to Bath on a Saturday and returned on a Tuesday in
March. I do not remember the exact day. I did not know then
that I should want the register of my birth, and did not talk about
the entry in the Bible at all.
I have read what is stated here and it is quite true.
JULIA Cox.
Mrs. Constable adds :
10th April, 1903.
From notes in my possession I know that Miss Cox (my cook)
went to Bath on Saturday, March 14th, and returned on the follow
ing Tuesday, March 17th, 1903.
LOUISA CONSTABLE.
Mr. Constable writes, enclosing the above, and explaining
the circumstances further :
April 10th, 1903.
Julia Cox invested through me some money in an annuity. I
thought she had better get at once an acknowledgment from the
office that her birth was rightly declared and so, after her visit
to Bath on the 14th March, told her to get a copy of the entry
in the Bible.
JAN., 1904. CW. 179
Mr. Constable writes later :
April ISlh, 1903.
Mrs. Hope is here to spend the day with Julia Cox. She has
just now told me :—
" I dreamt on the Monday night Julia came to me for the Bible.
She said she wanted a copy of her register. What amazed me
was she said she could take better care of the Bible than I could.
On Tuesday I went to the theatre and when I came back about
half-past ten there was my husband and the Bible on the table. I
told him of my dream and he said he had a letter from Julia
asking for her register. It was very funny. Oh, yes ! It seemed
just a dream."
Her statement that it was "just a dream" was in answer to
my question. I thought the impression might have been stronger
than an ordinary dream.
To a further question Mrs. Hope adds:—"I have had dreams
before of little matters that have come true, but none so real as
that one."
F. C. CONSTABI.K.
AN UNFULFILLED VISION.
PSYCHICAL researchers would be the last persons to deny the
occurrence of veridical dreams and visions. The Journal of the
Society is frequently supplied with well-authenticated instances,
and one is perhaps a little inclined to over-estimate the pro
portion realisations bear to failures. The following case is
therefore of interest, and is typical of a great number of un
fulfilled presentiments which are forgotten and unrecorded.
Mrs. G. is entirely devoted to her only son, and he recipro
cates her affection. When the war broke out in South Africa,
he volunteered for service, and came in for a great deal of hard
fighting and privation. Mrs. G-. was recovering from a severe
illness, and, to spare her feelings, he pretended he was going
to America, and enlisted under an assumed name. Mrs. G.
wrote to me as an old friend of her son's on April 18th, 1900,
and I give the following extract from her letter. She had
heard nothing of her son for four months, except a hurried
note, purporting to be sent from New York, until a few days
before she wrote to me—April 13th—when she learnt that
180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1004.
he was fighting in South Africa. So on the date of the vision
she supposed him to be in British Columbia.
"I dozed off for u few minutes on the 13th of March, in
the afternoon, and saw my son gliding rapidly towards me, an
expression of beautiful ideal youth, with brightest eye, all
beyond the brightness of this world, and clad in long black
garment, double-breasted, with something white floating behind
his head. The impact caused my -chair seemingly to topple
over, and the shock awakened me."
Young Mr. G. returned safe and sound in 1901, and I asked
him if anything particular had occurred on March 13th. He
assures me that nothing unusual took place, though he was
suffering from dysentery, and was one of the force which
occupied Bloernfontein on that day. He tells me his mother
has had presentiments about him on former occasions, and that
once, at least, when an accident occurred to him at school,
the facts corresponded with the vision.
I should add that some knowledge of our literature proved
very useful in this case, for it enabled me to comfort the poor
lady by assuring her that the chances were in favour of the
vision being only the outcome of illness and over-wrought
nerves, though at the same time one was sympathetic and
interested.

HYPNOTISM :
ITS HISTORY, PRACTICE, AND THEORY.
BY J. MILNE BRAMWELL, M.B., C.M.
8»o. 478 page*. ISx. net.
The chief aim of this monograph is to draw the attention of medical men
to the therapeutic value of Hypnotism. The author gives the results of
twelve years of his own practice and research, with personal observations
of the work done in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and
Belgium.
The historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively-
little known work of the English pioneers, Elliotson, Esdaile, and Braid,
while the final chapter of references contains much information which has
not hitherto been published in accessible form.
The methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and
instructions given in regard to the management of the hypnotic state, with
details as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis. Hypnotic theories are
described and discussed, and special prominence is given to Mr. Myers's
theory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the
problems of hypnotism.

GENERAL MEETING.
THE 122nd General Meeting of the Society was held in the
Large Hall at 20 Hanover Square, W., on Friday, January 29th,
1904, at 8.30 p.m.; Sir Oliver Lodge in the chair.
The Chairman, after announcing that Professor W. F.
Barrett, F.R.S., had that afternoon been elected President of
the Society for the year 1904, read some extracts from the
Report of the Council for the year 1903, which is printed
in full below.
PROFESSOR BARRETT then delivered a Presidential Address,
of which we only give a brief summary here, as it will shortly
be published in the Proceedings. After referring to the progress
made by the Society since its foundation in 1882, the President
spoke of the Endowment Fund for Psychical Research, which
was now a little over £6000 in amount, and to which he
invited further contributions, for the purpose of appointing paid
workers to supplement the experimentation and research now
carried on almost exclusively by volunteers. Two problems,
which needed the co-operation of many workers, urgently
required further investigation ; these were telepathy and motor
automatism. In regard to telepathy we need to know whether,
in some degree, it is a faculty common to the race, whether
it extends to the life of other animals besides man, etc. We
202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., ISKM.
were as far as ever from understanding the process by which
one mind can influence another at a distance, though it seemed
probable that it was through some sub-conscious stratum of
our personality. The percipient's impression may then be elicited
by means of motor automatism, in one form or another, and by
investigation of the various forms of automatism we may finally
discover a method by which success in telepathic experiments
can be commanded. The subjects of Hypnotism and Spiritualistic
phenomena were then discussed, and the question of a medium
or intermediary was shown to have its analogue in physical
science, the nexus between the seen and unseen, whether in
physical or psychical phenomena, being always a specialised
substance or organism. Further, it seemed highly probable that
a medium was necessary on both sides, here in our present
environment as well as in the unseen environment. The trun
cated personality which appears to be presented in the trance
communications of Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Thompson was con
sidered in conclusion.
Shortly after the delivery of his Presidential Address, Professor
Barrett received the following letter, which we have great
pleasure in printing here :—
"THE HERMITAGE, GDILDFORD, February 4<A, 1904.
"After listening to your eloquent address at the [last]
Meeting of the Society, I felt much tempted to introduce
myself to you. . . . You appealed to members of the
Society in your address to each do something to promote
its interests, and though I am comparatively a poor man, I
am prepared to give £50 towards the fund being collected
to endow a scholarship, provided 19 others, Members or
Associates, will do as much. That is, I will at once pay
over £50 to this fund on learning that 19 others have
given £50, thus completing the £1000; my offer to hold
good for the year 1904. I will at once pay over the £50 to
you, if you please, to hold till the end of this year ; when if
the offer has not succeeded, the money must be returned to me.
" MORRIS HUDSON."
Professor Barrett adds :—
" I beg to draw the attention of our members to the above
letter and generous offer of Mr. Morris Hudson. It is a matter
MAE., 1904. General Meeting. 203
of urgent importance that the Besearch Fund should as soon as
possible be raised to £8000, the sum which the Council have
decided is the minimum required. I am quite sure that many
of our members, who cannot give their personal help in our
enquiries, would be willing to contribute towards the Research
Fund if they but once realised the urgency of the need for
further workers. So far we cannot boast of much assistance
to the Fund from the general body of our members. Two
members have made anonymous donations amounting to £1000,
Mrs. Hickman (who is not a member) has contributed 50
guineas, Mr. Best, before he joined the Society, 5 guineas and
the Rev. W. S. Grignon, a member, 1 guinea. That completes the
list. We have taken from the general funds of the Society
£1000, and the legacy bequeathed to us by the Hon. Alexander
Aksakof comes to about £4000 ; the total of the Fund amounts
therefore at present (including interest) to about £6,200. I
ought perhaps to apologise for thus pressing Mr. Hudson's letter
on the attention of our members ; for when the Fund was started
the Council purposely refrained from issuing a general appeal.
But when an individual member now comes forward on his own
initiative, I feel bound not only to endorse his proposal but to
call on others to follow his lead. I hope that any one who
cannot afford a contribution of £50 will not be deterred from
sending a smaller sum. Donations should be sent to the Hon.
Treasurer, Mr. H. Arthur Smith, 7 Queen's Mansions, Brook
Green, London, W., or to myself, addressed 6 De Vesci Terrace,
Kingstown, Co. Dublin.
"W. F. BARRETT."
REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1903.
ONE of the most important events of the year has been the
consolidation of the Endowment Fund for Psychical Research,
the Trust Deed l of which was sealed and engrossed in January.
It will be remembered that the Fund was started towards the
end of 1902 by a gift of £750 from a Member of the
Society. This year another Member has contributed £250 ;
Mr. Aksakoff, who died on Jan. 17th, 1903, generously left
'Full particulars of the provisions of the Trust Deed were given in the
Journal for March, 1903.

206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1904.
to the Society a bequest amounting in English money, after
the payment of duty,1 to £3805 3s. Id., and in order to
bring this sum up to £4000, £194 16s. lid. was drawn
from the ordinary income of the Society, another £1000
having previously, in accordance with a resolution of Council,
been transferred to the Endowment Fund from the invested
funds of the Society. With a few other gifts, reported in the
Journal at the time, and accumulated interest, the Fund
amounted at the end of 1903 to about £6200.
The Treasurer's report shows how the money is invested.
This is an encouraging start, but the Fund still falls far short
of the necessary minimum of £8000, and until this minimum
sum is attained we have to do without the much-needed
services of a Research Scholar.
One of the chief obstacles to advance in the work of the
Society is that it has to be carried on mainly by unpaid
workers, who can devote only their leisure time to it.
Hitherto the expenses—often very considerable—of any work
beyond what may be called the official business of the Society,
including the publication of Proceedings, etc., have been de
frayed almost entirely by the munificence of a few of our
original Members. Shortly after the death of Mr. Myers the
Council issued an appeal to the members for further and more
general help in carrying on the ordinary work. This was
responded to generously by a few persons, with the result that
the Society is now housed in more central and convenient
quarters, with greater facilities for experimentation, etc., and
has been able to add to its paid staff. The increase in
number of members, however, and especially the fact that
almost all the correspondence of the Society (answers to
enquiries, etc.)—is now conducted through the office instead
of, as used to be the case, through a few of the leading
members, has thrown so much additional labour on the paid
staff that experimentation and research still depend chiefly on
the few—the very few—unpaid workers who take a genuine
interest in the subject. It would be a great advantage to
have in addition even one competent student who could devote
the whole of his time and energy to it.
1 Negotiations are in progress by which it is hoped that part at least of this
iluty may be recovered from the Russian Government.
MAR., 1904. Report of the Council. 207
With regard to the current accounts for the year, a few
points may be noted :
The amoxmt received in subscriptions—our most important
source of income—is slightly higher than last year ; on the
other hand, the sale of publications has been decidedly less in
America, and somewhat less in England. This is an item
which naturally varies greatly from year to year, partly
depending on the very variable amount published during the
twelvemonth. This year a comparatively small amount has
been published, so that the bill for printing is less than
usual. An item which appears for the first—and we hope
the last—time this year is £9 Os. 3d. for Rates. The Society
has now obtained a certificate exempting it, as a scientific
Society, from the payment of rates. The balance in hand at
the end of the year is larger than usual, amounting to £578,
but much of this will shortly be absorbed in heavy printing
and other expenses already incurred.
There has been a considerable increase in membership during
the year. At the beginning of 1903, the numbers were as
follows: Ordinary Members 194, Honorary and Corresponding
Members, 33 ; Total, 227 ; Ordinary Associates, 543, Honorary
Associates, 22 ; Total, 565. During the year, 29 new Mem
bers were elected and 2 Associates became Members, and one
Honorary Associate was made a Corresponding Member ; on
the other hand, the loss in number of Members through
various causes was 18, leaving a net increase of 14 Mem
bers. 82 new Associates were elected and 4 Members became
Associates ; the loss in number of Associates through various
causes was 60 (including 3 Honorary Associates), leaving a
net increase of 26 Associates. The total increase of member
ship during the year is thus 40, and the total number of
Members and Associates of all classes is now 832. During the
year the American Branch has also increased from 511 to 536.
In March Mr. N. W. Thomas resigned the post of Organ
ising Secretary, and Miss Alice Johnson was appointed
Secretary, while retaining her previous post of Editor of the
Proceedings and Journal. In October Miss Larminie, who had
been Assistant for a year, was made Assistant Secretary, and
a Junior Assistant has since been appointed.
The Library is now being re-arranged by Mr. E. Westlake,
208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1904.
the books being classified under different subjects. It will be
supplemented by the purchase of a certain number of standard
books which at present it does not contain, and a complete
classified catalogue will shortly be printed which is intended
to form a sort of bibliography of psychical research. This
will give some information to students as to what books exist
on different subjects, and will also facilitate reference to the
general literature.
The necessary task of preparing a single elaborate and
exhaustive Index to the innumerable topics and cases con
tained in the Proceedings, Journals, American Proceedings, and
Phantasms of the Living, is nearing completion. Miss C.
Burke has been engaged on the work during the last two
or three years, and the Index is now being printed. It will
be prefaced by a complete list of contents of the Proceedings.
As it is felt that this Index will only be of use and interest
to a limited number of members, it will not form part of
the series of periodical publications issued free to members
and associates, but will be on sale to them at terms to be
announced later.
The satisfactory increase of attendance of members and
associates at meetings, noted last year, has been fully main
tained. Three General and three Private Meetings (for
Members and Associates only) were held during the year ;
the dates and the papers read were as follows:
'January 30th. "Presidential Address" by SIR OLIVER LODGE,
F.RS.
March 13th. "A Case of Secondary Personality" by PRO
FESSOR J. H. HYSLOP.
April 20th. "A Further Account of Experiments in Auto
matic Writing" by MRS. A. W. VERRALL.
*June 18th. "Some Eeviews and Comments on Mr. Myers'
Human Personality " by MR. ANDREW LANG,
DR. WALTER LEAF, and SIR OLIVER LODGE.
*November 2nd. " Further Experiments in Dowsing and some
Considerations thereon " by PROFESSOR W.
F. BARRETT, F.RS.
December 7th. " Types of Phenomena exhibited in Mrs. Thomp
son's Trances" by MR. J. G. PIDDINGTON.
* Those marked with an asterisk were General Meetings.
, 1904. Report of the Council. 209
Though it was not one of the Society's publications, we
may refer to the appearance this year of an important work on
Hypnotism by one of our most distinguished members, Dr. J.
Milne Bramwell. The book being written primarily for medical
men deals chiefly with the therapeutic side of Hypnotism, but
it contains also a valuable history and discussion of hypnotic
theories, as well as a very full bibliography, and treats
further of the psychological aspect, on which Dr. Bramwell's
own work, and especially his classical experiments on the
hypnotic appreciation of time, have thrown much light.
A satisfactory symptom of the advance of our studies in
the general estimation is to be found in the marked change
of tone in the public, and especially in the press, towards the
subject as compared with that of only a few years ago.
Psychical phenomena are now constantly discussed even in.
daily papers, the General Meetings of the Society are reported,
and its work is spoken of almost always with friendliness, if
not with respect. Newspaper reporters often come to the
rooms,—sometimes no doubt with frivolous questions, or merely
in search of sensations, but occasionally with a little knowledge
of, or at least an intelligent interest in, the subject. If our
Society has done nothing else, it can at least claim the merit
of having raised the standard of the magazine ghost story.
" Ghost stories " are becoming a favourite topic in the papers,,
and it may be noted that they are generally recent stories.
The majority of them, as our enquiries have shown again and
again, are worthless, if not fictitious ; but among the cases
printed in the Journal during 1903 three were brought to
our notice through newspaper paragraphs, and, on investigation,
seemed to reach a sufficiently high evidential standard to make
them worth printing, besides a fourth case, that of an alleged
premonitory dream, in which investigation showed the accuracy
of the newspaper statements, though neither the dreamer nor
ourselves regarded the evidence as pointing to more than a
chance coincidence. A fifth newspaper case which has
stood the brunt of enquiry is also about to appear in the
Journal for February, 1904.
With regard to dubious cases, two have attracted special
notice this year:—the alleged prediction of the Servian murders
and the diminishing loaves of Beverley Farm. A brief note on
210 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1904.
the former case was printed in the Journal, and a full analysis
of the evidence by Mr. Piddington, showing its fundamental
defects, was published in Light. A report of the Beverley case
appears in the Journal for January, 1904.
While good cases from any reputable informant are welcome,
we ought not to have to depend so largely as we do on
outside sources, and the Council must express their disappoint
ment at receiving so small an amount of material from the
members of the Society. No doubt all have not equal oppor
tunities of contributing; but among the 1362 English, foreign,
and American members, there must be many who meet now
and then with phenomena capable of being recorded and in
vestigated. The records may or may not be worth printing,
but they are almost always worth making ; and the officers
of the Society are always glad to receive them, and are
prepared to help investigators as far as possible.
Besides the investigation of spontaneous cases, a certain
amount of experimental work has been carried on at the
Rooms. In the summer a series of sittings was held with a
medium who practised " clairvoyance " professionally and was
said to be developing physical phenomena in private. The
medium and her husband, who accompanied her to all sittings
after the first (when nothing occurred), gave detailed accounts
of various phenomena, such as " direct writing," etc., occurring
in their own house, and brought specimens of the writing.
Both the accounts and the specimens were suggestive of
trickery ; and when the medium, with her own consent, was
searched before' one of the sittings, half a dozen trick
playing cards were found in her pocket, corresponding exactly
to what would have been required to produce one of the per
formances she had described. A careful cross-examination
proved later that she had brought these cards with her
deliberately. At the sittings, one phenomenon only occurred,—
the appearance of a bunch of cherries under the medium's
chair,—and under conditions which she herself and her husband
admitted at the time to be quite inconclusive. She attempted
also to obtain clairvoyant impressions with regard to the sitters,
but with no success.
In the autumn, arrangements had been made for sittings
with a well known professional trance medium. These unfortu

nately fell through, as she was unable to attend, owing to the
illness of one of her relatives.
Experiments in thought-transference were conducted at
intervals during the autumn with some members of the
Society. Unfortunately the success 'obtained was not above
chance, though there seemed some slight indications of improve
ment as the experiments went on, and it is hoped that the
experimenters will persevere with them.
Another series was arranged on a novel principle, as follows :
Six experimenters were involved, all in different places, five
being agents and one the percipient, and none knowing who
the others were. One experiment was tried every day, each
experimenter acting as percipient for a week and agent the
rest of the time. A central organiser, Colonel Taylor, arranged
the parts to be played by each, informed the agents daily on
what they were to concentrate their thoughts, and received
daily from the percipient a record of his impressions. After
six weeks, the whole record was tabulated. The objects chosen
for transference were the numbers from 10 to 99, selected by
lot every day by Colonel Taylor, so that the amount of success
attributable to chance might be calculated. The total success
obtained was not beyond what chance might have produced,
though with one percipient, out of six experiments, one digit
was guessed correctly in three cases.
Members are urged to repeat these or similar experiments.
The evidence for thought-transference must necessarily be more
convincing when the experimenters are at a distance from one
another, and there is no proof that success is more difficult
under those conditions ; it has been obtained thus before, and
no doubt may be obtained again, if trials are made by a
sufficiently large number of persons. At the same time, if
enough care is taken as to the conditions, experiments with
agent and percipient in the same room may also be very
valuable. The Eooms of the Society can occasionally be used
after office hours for purposes of experiment by members or
associates. Application should be made to the Secretary.
Last year was marked by the appearance of Professor William
James's brilliant and suggestive work on The Varieties oj
Religious Experience, in which the far-reaching importance to
psychology of Mr. Myers's conception of the subliminal self
212 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1904.
was for the first time recognised by a psychologist of acknow
ledged pre-eminence. This year will be still more memorable
in the history of psychical research as the date of publication
of Mr. Myers's own book, Human Personality. Not only had
the book an immediate success, far beyond the most sanguine
expectations, and certainly far beyond the calculations of the
publishers, but it has created a deep and widely spread
interest in the subject which seems likely to be permanent.
It is undoubtedly in great part to its appearance that the
alteration of tone in the press and the public already referred to
is due, and the change has affected not the newspaper reader
alone, but the most serious and intelligent part of the reading
community.
The Council feel that it is more than ever incumbent on
the Society to live up to the opportunity thus created for it.
What has hampered advance in the past is the sustained
indifference of the great mass of members ; what will aid advance
in the future is individual effort on the part of all who have
opportunities. It is not enough to throw out suggestions for
some one else to do something,—a course which appears to
commend itself to a good many of our members.
A great part of the work that has to be done consists
of uninteresting details, and is unlikely to reflect any kvdos
on the workers. To take a single instance : a large amount
of time has been spent this year, and for nearly twenty years
past, by the Hon. Treasurer on routine work. If this work
were to stop, the business affairs of the Society would soon
be in hopeless confusion : as long as it goes on, they retain
an order which effectively shrouds both them and the Treasurer
from the public view.
Further, as in all scientific work, it may be necessary to
go on a long time without producing results of any obvious
interest or value. Much of our work must still be tentative
and still preliminary ; but looking back on what has been
accomplished since the foundation of the Society in 1882,
we have every reason to hope for the future.

HYPNOTISM :
ITS HISTOEY, PRACTICE, AND THEORY.
BY J. MILNE BRAMWELL, M.B., C.M.
Sue. 478pa;/e*. 18*. net.
The chief aim of this monograph is to draw the attention of medical men
to the therapeutic value of Hypnotism. The author gives the results of
twelve years of his own practice and research, with personal observations
of the work done in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and
Belgium.
The historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively
little known work of the English pioneers, Elliotson, Esdaile, and Braid,
•while the final chapter of references contains much information which has
not hitherto been published in accessible form.
The methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and
instructions given in regard to the management of the hypnotic state, with
details as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis. Hypnotic theories are
described and discussed, and special prominence is given to Mr. Myers's
theory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the
problems of hypnotism.

GHOST STORIES OF 100 YEARS AGO: A WARNING
TO "GHOSTS" AND TO PSYCHICAL RESEARCHERS
OF THE PRESENT DAY.
BY SIR AUGUSTUS K. STEPHENSON, K.C.B., K.C.
IN the Times newspaper of the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th
of January of the present year are given "extracts" from the
Times of 1804 for the corresponding dates.
From the Editorial observations it would appear that certain
other newspapers had accused the Times of having fabricated or
resuscitated an old story of 1 0 years previous—of having
" conjured up a Ghost without a head and stationed its haunts
in St. James's Park."
The Times thereupon printed the two following " declarations "
made and signed by two private soldiers of the Coldstream Guards,
before Officers of the Regiment.
The following is a copy of a declaration made and signed before
an Officer :
" I do solemnly declare, that, whilst on guard at the Recruit
house, on or about the 3rd instant, about half past one o'clock
in the morning, I perceived the figure of a woman, without a
head, rise from the earth, at the distance of about three feet
before me. I was so alarmed at the circumstance, that I had not
power to speak to it, which was my wish to have done ; but I
•distinctly observed that the figure was dressed in a red striped
gown with red spots between each stripe, and that part of the
dress and figure appeared to me to be enveloped in a cloud.
" In about the space of two seconds, whilst my eyes were fixed
on the object, it vanished from my sight. I was perfectly sober
and collected at the time, and, being in great trepidation, called
to the next sentinel, who met me about half way, and to whom
I communicated the strange sight I had seen.
(Signed) " GEORGE JONES,
"of Lieutenant-Colonel TAYLOR'S Company of
" Coldstream Guards.
"Westminster, Jan. 15, 1804."
To the declaration of JONES we have to add another, connected
with the subject, and which is equally genuine:—
" I do hereby declare, that, whilst on guard behind the Armoury-
house (to the best of my recollection about three weeks ago), I
APRIL, 1904. Ohost Stories of One Hundred Years Ago. 215
heard, at twelve o'clock at night, a tremendous noise, which pro
ceeded from the window of an uninhabited house, near to the
spot where I was upon duty. At the same time, I heard a voice
cry out, 'Bring me a light! bring me a light!' The last sentence
was uttered in so feeble and so changeable tone of voice, that I
concluded some person was ill, and consequently offered them my
assistance to procure a light. I could, however, obtain no answer
to my proposal, although I repeated it several times, and as often
heard the voice use the same terms. I endeavoured to see the
person who called out, but in vain. On a sudden the violent
noise was renewed, which appeared to me to resemble sashes of
windows lifted hastily up and down, but then they were moved
in such quick succession, and at different parts of the house nearly
at the same time, that it seemed impossible to me that one person
could accomplish the whole business. I heard several of the regi
ment say they have heard similar noises and proceedings, but I
have never heard the cause accounted for.
(Signed) " RICHARD DONKIN,
"12th Company of Coldstream Guards
"Whitehall, Jan. 15, 1804."
The Times then adds :
After furnishing the above documents, we shall hardly be again
accused of having framed the account in Friday's Paper, from a
circumstance which occurred ten years ago.
It may be convenient here, for the sake of reference, to note
the three stories referred to in the above declarations and in
a report of proceedings at Bow Street given below as :
. (1) The St. James's Park Ghost.
(2) The uninhabited or "haunted" house in which voices
and noises were heard.
(3) The Hammersmith Ghost.
(1) and (2) were disposed of, so far as we now know, by the
following paragraphs in the Times of 16th and 17th January,
1804.
The Ghost in St. James's Park, we understand, originated in an
application of the PhantHsmagoria, by two unlucky Westminster
Scholars, who having got possession of an empty house on the
side of the Bird-cage walk, were enabled to produce the appear
ance which so greatly alarmed the sentinels on duty in the im
216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1904.
mediate vicinity of the spot, and has given such an extraordinary
subject to the curiosity of the public.
The house referred to in (2) must have been one in Spring
Gardens, on the site of which the new Admiralty Buildings now
stand, and the " Westminster Scholars " may have been respon
sible for the voices and noises.
The Times of January 17th, 1804, has the following:
PARK GHOST.
PUBLIC-OFFICE, BOW STREET.
Yesterday George Jones, of Lieut.-Colonel Taylor's Company of
Coldstream Guards, whose declaration respecting the Park Ghost
we yesterday published, was brought before Sir Richard Ford, to
be interrogated respecting the sight he was supposed to have seen.
Previous to his examination, Mr. Stafford, the Chief Clerk, endeavoured
to find out whether his imagination had received any impressions
from reading any dismal st»ry, or if he had, at the time the phantom
appeared to him, suffered the story of the Hammersmith Ghost
to dwell on his mind, in order, if possible, to ascertain if he had
been misled by his fancies. To these questions he answered in
the negative. On being asked respecting the strange object he had
seen, he solemnly declared that he was ready at any time to make
oath to what he had stated, and that he firmly believed he had
seen a ghost. He detailed everything in Court as near as possible
to what we yesterday inserted under his own signature.
It may be here observed that it does not appear on what
charge, if any, George Jones was "brought before" the magistrate
at Bow Street ; any military offence, such as sleeping on guard,
would have been dealt with by his regimental officers ; possibly
some charge was made against the " unlucky Westminster
Scholars"; but however that may be, we may consider (1) and
(2) as disposed of, and confine our attention to (3) "The
Hammersmith Ghost," the reference to which by the Chief
Clerk at Bow Street can be explained by the records contained
in two volumes of the Annual Register for the year 1804,
from which may be gathered the following particulars :
There appears to have been some change in the editorship
of the Annual Register for 1803-4, which may explain the
APRIL, 190*. Ghost Stories of One Hundred Yearn Ago. 217
existence of two volumes of the Register for that year, one of
which contains a very condensed report of a trial at the Old
Bailey on the loth of January of that year of one Francis
Smith for murder of one Millward, and the other a detailed
report of a Coroner's Inquisition on Millward's body, with a
fuller report of Smith's trial, which latter report, however,
omits altogether a most material circumstance connected with
the result of that trial, as recorded in the other volume.
Keferring to these three reports, the following may be taken
as a summary of the circumstances connected with No. 3, the
Hammersmith Ghost of 1804.
For some five weeks previous to January, 1804, the in
habitants of Hammersmith, (then a suburban village of scattered
houses, connected by dark unfrequented lanes, bounded in places
by high hedges), had been alarmed by the frequent appearances
of " a Ghost," described as dressed sometimes entirely in white,
sometimes in the skin of a cow or other wild beast. One witness
at the trial of Smith said he and a fellow servant had met the
Ghost one night in the churchyard, that he touched it and felt
something soft, but whatever it was, it disappeared. Another
witness had met and given chase to the Ghost, who only
escaped by throwing away the sheet in which he was en
veloped, and so outrunning his pursuer, who however got near
enough to say that this Ghost was a tall man wearing a
dark coat with shiny metal buttons. It also appeared that
two clergymen had each offered a reward of five guineas for the
capture of the Ghost, and that several persons had gone ghost
hunting armed with guns, etc., but without success ; until on
the 3rd January, 1804, a certain Mr. Francis Smith, an excise
officer, went out for the declared purpose of looking for the
Ghost, carrying a fowling piece loaded with shot, and having
taken the precaution to arrange with " a watchman," who carried
a pistol, that if they two met in the dark, they should challenge
each other. Smith did meet a figure in white, in a dark lane
with high hedges, and was heard by a witness who gave evidence
at his trial to say, " Damn you, who are you ? speak or I'll
shoot ! " Smith's own account as given to the jury at his trial
was that the figure gave no answer but "came on." Smith there
upon fired, and at such close quarters that he practically nearly
blew the Ghost's head off, blackening its face with gunpowder.
218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1904.
The Ghost fell to the ground, and Smith immediately went for
assistance, and was no doubt terribly distressed, and insisted
on giving himself up to the Police. The Ghost (on this occasion)
turned out to be one Millward, a respectable bricklayer, with
whom Smith was slightly acquainted, but there was no sug
gestion of any ill-will between them. Millward on the night
in question was wearing a white jacket with white trousers
down to his heels ; he had previously been mistaken for the
Ghost and had been warned about his dress. It is not clear
whether he was on this particular night masquerading as the
Ghost, and from the evidence of his relatives, and the description
of the Ghost as seen by another witness, he certainly was not
the only Ghost, for he was not the tall man with dark coat
and shiny buttons enveloped in a sheet, and it is not clear
whether there were more Hammersmith Ghosts than one, besides
the original genuine Ghost, if he ever existed.
Under these circumstances, the coroner, while expressing
sympathy with Smith's and Millward's families, very properly
directed the jury to return a verdict of wilful murder against
Smith, so that the circumstances might be further investigated.
This the Coroner's jury did and Smith was tried a few days
afterwards at the Old Bailey on the Coroner's inquisition,
before the Lord Chief Baron Macdonald.
Smith was assisted by Counsel, who at that time were not
allowed to address the jury, but who called and examined
witnesses on Smith's behalf. The witnesses gave Smith an
excellent character for humanity and respectability, and Smith
himself addressed the jury admitting all the tacts, and expressing
the greatest sorrow for the fatal result. The Lord Chief Baron
in a most careful charge explained the law to the jury, telling
them that there was no justification in anything urged by
Smith, that the facts did not admit of a verdict of manslaughter,
and that their duty was to find Smith guilty of wilful murder.
The jury, however, after long consideration, returned a verdict
of manslaughter.
The Lord Chief Baron refused to receive the verdict, and
after conferring with the two other judges, Lawrence and Kooke,
and the .Recorder, who all three expressed themselves as in
entire agreement with the law as laid down by the L. C. B., told
the jury to reconsider their verdict, which must be either not
APRIL, 19M. Ghost Stories of One Hundred Years Ago. 219
guilty or guilty of murder. The jury then returned a verdict
of wilful murder.
The Lord Chief Baron thereupon passed sentence of death
in the usual form, to be carried into execution on the following
Monday. And there the report in one of the volumes of the
Annual Register ends !
In the other volume it is, however, stated that a reprieve
was obtained that very night, and the sentence commuted into
one of a year's imprisonment in Newgate.
I have also found a note of the trial of Smith at the Old
Bailey, which purports to be from an MS. report of Mr. Justice
Bayley. (There were no Old Bailey official reports in those
days, as there are now.) This shows that the case is good law,
as it is accepted as such, and referred to in the text-books. The
passage occurs in Vol. I. of Russell on Crimes under the heading
"Murder," Book III., Section V., 3rd Edition, p. 546, with a
marginal note, " Killing a person who is committing a mis
demeanour," and is as follows :
It is no excuse for killing a man that he was out at night as a
Ghost dressed in white for the purpose of alarming the neighbour
hood, even though he could not otherwise be taken. The
neighbourhood of Hammersmith had been alarmed by what was
supposed to be a Ghost; the prisoner went out with a loaded gun
to take the Ghost ; and upon meeting with a person dressed in white,
immediately shot him. Macdonald, C.B., Rooke and Lawrence,
J.J., were clear this was murder, as the person who appeared as a
Ghost was guilty only of a misdemeanour ; and no one might kill
him, though he could not otherwise be taken. The jury, however,
brought in a verdict of manslaughter; but the Court said that they
could not receive that verdict ; and told the jury that, if they
believed the evidence, they must find the prisoner guilty of murder ;
and if they did not believe the evidence, they should acquit the
prisoner. The jury then found the prisoner guilty, and sentence
was pronounced ; but the prisoner was afterwards reprieved. ^Reg. v.

The following observations will occur to psychical researchers,
whether amateurs or members of the S.P.R., and to all who
take an intelligent interest in the objects of the Society.
If you wish—following the example of the " unlucky West
minster Scholars"—to hoax or frighten other people without
220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1904.
danger to your own self, remember that your joke may have
serious consequences to others, as theirs might have had, and
possibly had, to the soldiers in the Park Ghost case.
If you wish to play the Ghost in propria persond, like the
unfortunate Mr. Millward, if you are challenged by a psychical
researcher, answer your challenger ; for your own sake as well
as for his, don't " come on," but throw away your disguise and
run away, as the tall man in the black coat with shiny
buttons did in the Hammersmith Ghost case.
If you are a keen psychical researcher, like Mr. Francis
Smith, don't pursue your researches with a loaded gun, or other
deadly weapon ; if you have the good fortune to fall in with a
ghost who does not answer your challenge but " comes on "—
don't shoot him, but wait till he comes near enough, and then
knock him down, if you think you feel equal to so doing ; if
not, run away yourself. It is very unlikely, ghost or no ghost,
that he will run after you—and you will be able to tell the
story in your own way the next day, and compare your ex
perience with other researchers.
And, lastly—and this is the most important moral to be
drawn from these narratives if you take an intelligent interest
in the objects of. the S.P.R. and the ascertainment of truth—
if you have the good fortune to see a ghost, or to experience
a hallucination or illusion for which you cannot find any
reasonable explanation, or if you know a friend who has had
any such experience, don't write to tfie newspapers, but com
municate confidentially in the first instance with one of the
Honorary Secretaries, or with the Secretary to the S.P.R., 20

DR. A. A. LI^BEAULT.
BY the death of the venerable Dr. Liobeault the S.P.R. loses a
distinguished and valued Corresponding Member. He died at
Nancy, on February 18th, 1904, in his 81st year, after a pro
longed illness. Auguste Ambroise Lit-beault was born at Favieres
(Meurthe), in 1823, and studied medicine at the University of
Strasburg, where he took his M.D. degree in 1850. He started
practice in the small town of Pont-Saint-Vincent, and lived there
for some years the ordinary life of a hard working country
doctor. At College he had become interested in the psychical
side of medicine, and he soon began to use hypnotism in his
practice. In 1864 he removed into Nancy and the house in
which he lived for the remainder of his life. There he
opened a dispensary for the free treatment of the poor, and
in this he worked for many years, appreciated by a large
clientele drawn from the poor of the district, but ignored and
misrepresented by the medical profession. In 1866 he pub
lished his first book, Le Sommeil et les Hats analogues, con-
sidtris surtout au point de vue de faction du moral sur le
physique, a work which shows great power of observation and
research, but for which there was no demand.
It was not until 1882 that the attention of Dr. Bernheim,
professor of medicine in the University, was directed to
Lidbeault through some remarkable cures, and he became an
attendant and pupil at the unpretentious Clinique in the Rue
de Bellevue.
After a short period of scepticism Bernheim became an
enthusiastic adherent, and began to use hypnotism on a large
scale in the wards of the Nancy general hospital. His
position enabled him to compel attention, and he was joined in
his researches by Beaunis, professor of physiology, and Liegeois,
professor of law—a remarkable trinity of talent, which was
222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1904.
the foundation of what is termed the Nancy School of Sugges
tion. Liebeault thus had the good fortune to see his character
vindicated and his theories widely accepted. His modest dis
pensary was visited by medical investigators from all parts of
the world, and many of his pupils have established successful
cliniques in the cities of Europe and America.
His enthusiasm, geniality, and kindness of heart won the
hearts of all who knew him, and in 1890, when he retired from
practice on a modest competence, he was the recipient of a
remarkably cosmopolitan testimonial, subscribed to by about
fifty medical pupils and admirers from all parts of the world.
The presentation was made at a banquet at Nancy, presided
over by the late Professor Dumontpallier, of the Hotel Dieu,
Paris, and was the occasion of much eloquence.
Dr. Milne Bramwell has shown in the Proceedings of the
S.P.R. and elsewhere that James Braid not only evolved
hypnotism, the name and method, from the discredited theories
of mesmerism, but also understood and practised suggestion,
especially in his later years ; but the English surgeon left no
followers, and when he died in I860 psycho-therapy, so far
as the medical profession was concerned, may be said to have
become extinct. It is to the genius of Lidbeault as well as
to his enthusiasm and singleness of heart that we owe the
full recognition of the part played by suggestion, verbal or
otherwise, in psychical research, as well as in the cure of
disease.
Probably the very retirement and obscurity in which he
lived tended to the final triumph of his theories, for he was
thus enabled to work quietly, and to accumulate the store of
facts and experience which at last convinced inquirers. His
theory, shortly expressed, is that disease depends upon mis
direction of nervous energy, there being sometimes a super
fluity in certain organs which may lead, e.g., to neuralgia or
epilepsy ; and at other times a deficiency which may produce, e.g.,
paralysis or neurasthenia. Hypnotism, by means of suggestion
acting on the highest brain centres, enables the physician to
concentrate the attention on the affected part, and bring about
redistribution of energy and consequent restitutio ad integrum.
Dr. Liebeault had no children, but his widow and adopted
daughter survive him. CHAS. LLOYD TUCKEY, M.D.

CASES.
P. 276. Dream.
The following case was obtained for us by the Rev. A. T. Fryer.
We are requested not to print the names of the persons con
cerned, all of which were given to us in full. The first account
of the case was contained in a letter addressed to Mr. Fryer,
as follows :—
Dectmlier \0th, 1903.
DEAR MR. FRYER,—I believe the following will interest you :—
A young lady lives with us who is a Kindergarten Teacher.
She is the intimate friend and companion of her head-mistress, who
was engaged to be married next Christmas.
She often went for walks and outings with the affianced couple.
Both were dear to her. He was Art Master at the Pupil Teachers'
Centre, . One morning about three weeks ago our young lady
came down to breakfast in a very excited and gloomy state, ami said
that she had been terribly upset by an awful but very vivid dream.
She had dreamt that the Art Master had been suddenly taken
ill, and that the Head- Mistress had gone to nurse him, but that in
spite of every effort they had failed to save his life.
I said " Pooh, pooh, dreams go by the contrary, it refers to the
wedding."
She said, " It has upset me very much ; it seemed so real." That
day she asked her friend how her fianc£ was, who answered that
he was splendid. " Because," said she, " I dreamt last night he
was very ill."
"Oh," replied her friend, "he was as strong as a lion last night
anyhow."
During the day she remarked, " I shall be glad to see him to-night,
your dream has made me somewhat anxious."
She met him and found that he had contracted a slight cold. The
slight cold lasted a fortnight and then developed into pneumonia.
His fiancee went to nurse him. Every effort was made to save him,
but he was buried at churchyard yesterday. . . .
Mr. Fryer sent a series of questions to his informant, the
Rev. J. G., to be answered by himself and the dreamer, and
the questions and answers are next given, with the exception
of those relating to the names of the witnesses :—
Q. Are there any circumstances which will serve to fix the exact
date of dream, and hour '
224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1904.
Ans. This question has caused us some difficulty. So far we
have discovered that the dream took place on the night following
the report of two burglaries at Newport. If this is important, I
will endeavour to get you the date.
The dream took place about the middle of the night.
Q. Was any written note made by the dreamer at the time ; in
diary or elsewhere 1
Ans. No.
Q. Will the dreamer write out her dream in, as nearly as possible,
the words used to you and to the head mistress?
Ans. Mrs. J. G. told me she had a had night, and I told her
I had had a very strange dre;im and could not sleep afterwards as
it preyed on my mind. I dreamt that Mr. D was very ill, and
Miss N and I were nursing him ; he looked very thin and
haggard, and he was stout and robust in appearance, and he was
so patient, but was very feverish. We nursed him between us, and
I did most of the running about, while she did not leave him. I
dreamt that he died, and that he appeared very like a doctor friend
of mine in Liverpool. In my dream a horrid feeling crept over me
at the idea of the undertaker coming, and this woke me up. I told
the Rev. and Mrs. J. G. the whole of my dream as above, but only
told Miss N a part of the dream, as follows : " I had a horrid
dream about Mr. D last night." She replied, "What was it?"
I said, "It was strange, too, because I had not been thinking or talking
about him beforehand. I dreamt he was very ill and you and I were
nursing him. I could see him and the room quite vividly, and he
looked so thin but feverish, and we had very soft slippers on and
made as little noise as possible." She said, "I (shall be anxious to
see him, although he was perfectly well last night." Then I laughed
and said, "Dreams go by opposites." We then dropped the con
versation. My part of the fulfilment re nursing. When he was ill
I used to fetch medicine, fruit, fish, etc., for Miss N to take
to him. On one occasion I had agreed to meet a certain train with
fruit, etc. for Miss N to take to (the place where he lived).
Miss N had gone by an earlier train, so 1 took them by train
myself. Upon arriving at the house' Miss N met me and was
so pleased I had come. She showed me into the drawing room.
Although I am not superstitious, the first thing I noticed was the
abundance of peacocks' feathers in the room. I said, "Those things
are supposed to be very unlucky." She laughed and said, " Well, he
hasn't had any luck since he put them up." I did not see him, and
APRIL, 1904. Cases. 225
never for one moment thought that he was dangerously ill. It was
that night that he passed away. (Signed) E. M.
Q Has the dreamer ever had a similar experience?
Ans No.
Q. Or any of her relatives ?
Ans. Not that I know of ...
Q. Is the head-mistress quite certain that the Art Master had
made no reference to his health on the evening previous to the dream T
Ans. Yes, quite.
Q Date of death ?
Ans. December 4th, 1903.
Q. Date of list interview with the Art Master previous to the
dream 1
Ans. November 20th, 1903.
Q. When did the dreamer relate her conversation with the head
mistress to you ]
Anx. The day after the dream.
Q. Had the dreamer ever had any suspicion of the Art Master's
real condition of health 1
Ans. No, not the least, he always looked and was considered
very strong.
Q. Did any friends of the Art Master know of or suspect hia-
" cold " on the night of the dream 1
Ans. No.
Q. If the master was so well as the head-mistress thought, on-
the evening previous to the dream, when did he contract the cold
which she says he had the day following 1
Ans. He contracted a slight cold November 21st, at Mr.
Chamberlain's meeting.
Mr. Fryer then wrote to the Head-Mistress, Miss N ,
asking for her corroboration, and received the following reply :
December 22nd, 1903.
I ... regret that I can recollect very little concerning Miss M.'s
dream, as far as the date and time of day when she related some
account of it to me.
As far as I remember it was either three or four weeks before my
friend's death. I believe three weeks ; and he died on the 4th inst.
Miss M came to me during morning school, asking me was
he well, for she had been dreaming that he was very ill, and that
she and I nursed him. She also said that, though he appeared to.
226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1904.
be really seriously ill, and extremely weak, he was wonderfully
patient, and as good-humoured as when in good health. Miss
M withheld the latter portion of her dream, fearing to distress
me, and I did not learn until afterwards that she also dreamed
that she saw him die. . . . My sister tells me that on the
day before she received the sad news grandpa told her that he
dreamt he saw a letter, and distinctly read news of a friend's death.
He is an old gentleman of 81 years, and nearly blind. He said
he could not make out who the friend was. I may add that he
was not aware of my engagement to Mr. D , neither did he
know that I was in trouble of any kind. His dream does not
appear to have given him any idea that the dream-letter had any
connection with me.
May I quote another curious experience, which may, or may not,
be connected with the same chain of events 1
In the early part of this last October I saw an apparition of my
mother. At the time I was not sleeping, but was most wide awake,
sitting up in bed studying, and my room well lighted with electric
light. My attention was arrested by what I thought was a reflec
tion, but on looking closely to my left I saw a remarkably distinct
figure of my mother. I cannot account for the expeiience in any
way. I am not given to dreaming, and have never had such an
experience before, or since. The strangest part of the occurrence
seemed to me to be the fact that I was not in the least disturbed
or frightened. I wondered at it, and decided to abandon my books
for the night and settle to sleep. The time of the appearance must
have been shortly after midnight. My mother died nine years ago,
on October llth, and I had not been thinking of her at the time.
I was, in fact, too busy to be thinking of anything outside my
work. . . .
Mr. Fryer writes :
2 NEWPORT ROAD, CARDIFF, January 27th, 1904.
I went to Newport on Monday last and saw Miss N . She is
quite positive about the fact of the dream having been told her before
she knew that Mr. D had [been] taken ill. Miss M is now
in N. Wales, but she has sent me her signature to her account.
There is no doubt about the fact of the burglaries, and consequent
talk about them before the Chamberlain meeting. . . .
In answer to further enquiries about the exact date of
Miss M.'s dream, Mr. J. G. wrote to Mr. Fryer as follows :—
APRIL, 1904. Cases. 227
January 2&lh, 1904.
I obtained information at the Newport Police Station that the
burglaries in question took place on the night of November 17th,
1903. This is later than we thought. It is difficult to fix the exact
sequence of events unless a record is kept. I fully thought that
the dream took place about a fortnight before Mr. Chamberlain's
meeting. I called at the Argus office to obtain a copy of the Argus
which contained an account of the burglaries, for the date of the
dream must be fixed from the account in the Argus.
They will supply me to-morrow with copies of the 17th, 18th,
and 1'Jth of November. I will forward you the necessary copy.
The dream took place on the night after the burglary news in
the Argus; Mr. Chamberlain's meeting, Nov. 21st.
Mr. Fryer afterwards obtained for us a copy of the Argus
for Wednesday, November 18th, 1903. In this a burglary
is reported to have taken place at Newport on the previous
Sunday night, and another one early on the Tuesday evening.
It seems to be the latter occasion that Mr. J. G. referred
to. The same paper announces that Mr. Chamberlain will
address a meeting at the Tredegar Hall, Newport, on Satur
day, November 21st, at 3.30 p.m. If, therefore, Mr. G.'s
recollection is correct as to Miss M.'s dream having happened
on the Wednesday night, and having been told to him on the
Thursday morning, this confirms the statement that her dream
was related before there was any suspicion of Mr. D.'s illness,
since, in fact, the illness apparently resulted from a cold caught
at the meeting of November 21st.
Finally Mr. Fryer sent us a letter from the clergyman who
officiated at Mr. D.'s funeral, stating that the latter had caught
a cold which developed into influenza, followed by acute
pneumonia, and that he died on December 4th.
L. 1137. Dream.
The following case of a coincidental dream was sent to us
by an Associate of the Society, Mr. Wilfred Hall, of Priors
Terrace, Tynemouth, Northumberland, in a letter dated January
4th, 1904, in which he informed us that the accounts were
furnished to him by a friend of his who was acquainted with
the ladies concerned. The first account is written by the
dreamer, Miss M. Kobson.
228 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1904.
On Monday, September 28th, Miss Elliott casually said to me
that she intended going to Sunderland on the following Saturday,
to see a friend.
That night I had a vivid dream : Miss Elliot came to me to show
a letter which she had received from her Sunderland friend, asking
her to postpone her visit, as bad news—some family trouble—necessi
tated her immediate departure.
I was much surprised when on the next day I told this dream
to hear that a letter in actually the same words had been that
morning received by Miss Elliott.
I may add I do not profess to attach any importance to dreams,
and it is quite an unusual thing for me to relate one.
M. EOBSON.
E. M. ELLIOTT.
Miss Elliott corroborates as follows :—
GATKSHKAD, November 25th, 1903.
Some time ago I mentioned to Miss Robson that I had to go to
Sunderlaiid on a certain day to see a friend.
On the morning of. the day on which I had arranged to go, I
received a post-card asking me to postpone my visit, as my friend
had had some very bad news about a sister living at some distance.
This news was totally unexpected, and was a great shock to me,
as I know all the family well.
When I saw Miss Robson an hour or so afterwards, almost her
first words to me were : " Oh, I had such a strange and vivid dream
last night." and then she proceeded to tell me her dream, which
was in all respects what had really happened, even to the wording
of the post-card.
I may say Miss Robson knows my friend Miss Smith, but has
never met her sister. E. M. ELLIOTT.
In reply to questions, Mr. Hall writes to us on January
22nd, 1904:—
The name and address of the friend of Miss Robson and Miss
Elliott is Dr. Louis Kornitzer, Holly Cottage, Monkseaton, Nor
thumberland.
At the time of forwarding the communication Miss Robson's address
was Miss M. Robson, 3 Richmond Terrace, Felling-on-Tyne, and Miss
Elliott's was Miss E. M. Elliott, 35 Peterboro Street, Gateshead.
Miss Smith is a real, and not an assumed name. Miss Smith's
address is Miss E. Smith, Albion House, Sunderland.
Miss Robson states that she has not had any similar experiences.
I may say that none of the persons referred to have any objection
to their names and addresses appearing in the Journal, if you would
like to publish same. WILFRED HALL.

HYPNOTISM :
ITS HISTORY, PRACTICE, AND THEORY.
BY J. MILNE BRAMWELL, M.B., C.M.
Svo. 478 pages. IBs. net.
The chief aim of this monograph is to draw the attention of medical men
to the therapeutic value of Hypnotism. The author gives the results of
twelve years of his own practice and research, with personal observations
of the work done in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and
Belgium.
The historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively
little known work of the English pioneers, Elliotson, Esdaile, and Braid,
while the final chapter of references contains much information which has
not hitherto been published in accessible form.
The methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and
instructions given in regard to the management of the hypnotic state, witti
details as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis. Hypnotic theories are
described and discussed, and special prominence is given to Mr. Myers's
theory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the
problems of hypnotism.

GENERAL MEETING.
THE 123rd General Meeting of the Society was held in the
large hall at 20 Hanover Square, W., on Monday, March 21st,
1904, at 8.30 p.m.; the President, Professor W. F. Barrett,
in the chair.
DR. ALBERT WILSON read a paper on " A Case of Multiple
Personality," of which the following is an abstract :
The object of this paper is to demonstrate that the Mind or
Character, the " Ego," which is the sum total of our personality
and individuality, is composed of several minor " egos," good
and bad. The minor " egos " being subject to the laws of health,
heredity, and environment, must vary, and this opens up the
great question of the day as to individual responsibility.
We must first try to obtain a broad, general idea of the
structure of the nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system
accompanies every blood vessel, regulating the blood supply.
When it allows the vessels to dilate, this produces blushing or
congestion and inflammation. When it causes the vessels to
contract, the result is pallor, chilblains, numb or ' dead ' fingers,
sick-headache, etc., according to the part affected. If the same
processes take place in the delicate brain structure, we find con
gestive headache, delirium, or mania from dilatation ; while from
spasm of the arteries, shutting off the blood supply, we get
paralysis of different functions, such as speech, sight or walking,
etc. The surface of the brain is mapped out into functional
areas for sight, smell, taste, hearing, and motor and sensory
232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1904.
functions, and the microscope reveals to us that this surface
or cortex is divided into five layers of cells.
Dr. S. A. Watson (by whose courtesy I refer to what is
not yet generally known) has discovered that the deeper
layers are the most ancient and more fully represented in
the lower animals. They are concerned with the voluntary
instincts for protection, production and preservation. The outer,
more superficial layer we call the pyramidal layer ; and it is
the seat of the higher intellectual faculties. Consequently it
is more highly developed in man, being deeper and thicker than
in the lower animals. The additional thickness is always on
the external surface, as slates are the latest stage in the growth
of a building.
If the pyramidal layer is diseased, mental deterioration and
insanity result. If'weakened by poisons, as alcohol, or bad air,
or if badly nourished, then perverted or defective mental action
is observed. Thus, in a person suffering from chronic alcoholism
I found the outer part of the pyramidal layer destroyed, which
fully accounted for her irresponsibility.
So that when this layer is damaged the individual is at once
placed on a lower platform, and may in severe cases approach
the animal type.
The patient to be described, here named Mary Barnes, I call
A in her normal state. B is the abnormal condition, but as there
were several abnormal conditions, I call them B 1 to B 10.
She was taken ill at the age of 12£ with influenza,
followed by meningitis. I watched her closely for about
4 years, and at intervals since. She was a well-behaved, intelli
gent child, and of good heredity.
The first trace of a new personality occurred at about the
sixth week of illness, when she was subject to attacks of
catalepsy. She then changed both in facial expression and
in manner, and became childish, clipping her words. She was
quite ignorant of the meaning of words, and had to be re
educated in the names of simple objects. She also reversed
colours, and wrote backwards ; not " mirror writing," but com
mencing at the tail of each word. She was usually paralysed
in the legs. She said she had* no name, but was " a thing."
I called this substage B 2, and B 2 was a frequent visitor
for two or three years.
MAT, 1904. General Meeting. 233
B 1 was a condition of acute delirium, like mania, with
intense fear and thirst, craving for oranges. The exhaustion
was very great. Once she was thought to be dead, being
possibly in a trance. The attack occurred first in the third
week of her illness, and six or seven times since. They came
and left with equal suddenness, and the alarming exhaustion
would equally disappear when another substage occurred.
This was probably an acute brain congestion.
B 3 had fits of temper. She was childish, but more
educated than B 2. She came for weeks at a time. Her
health was good, but she was liable to toothache. I once
removed a tooth from her under chloroform, and her father then,
by coaxing and calling her by name, brought back the normal
A. A knew nothing of the pain or the operation. The late
Dr. Althaus witnessed this most remarkable condition. It
illustrates the opposite of that stage of hypnotism in which
pain is lulled or not felt.
As B 3 she visited the seaside, but was frightened at first,
and said she had never seen the sea before. As A she had
constantly seen the sea and bathed.
B 4 was deaf and dumb, and only came two or three
times.
B 5 said she was only three days old, and was absolutely
ignorant of any event previous to the last three days. This
might be accounted for as a vaso-motor spasm shutting off
the bulk of her conscious existence.
B 6 was like B 2, but less childish and more intelligent.
She learned French, and was the only personality that under
stood French. She was a constant visitor, and finally, after A
disappeared, continues to this day.
B 7 was the opposite of B 5, for she had an abnormally
clear memory of the events of her infancy, not incompar
able to what occurs in the second childhood of senile decay.
She remembered when 2J years of age going on a tram to
see her father in a hospital. She also remembered an illness
which her mother suffered from when she (Mary Barnes) was
under 2 years of age.
B 8 was a state of confusion, perhaps a post-epileptic state.
B 9 showed different types of the lower animal instincts—
a tendency to kleptomania and violence.
234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1904.
In these stages one can see the superactivity of the lower
layers of the brain, cortex. There is exaggeration of the animal
instincts, with a loss of functional activity of the higher
intelligence.
B 10 came rather gradually, and lasted ahout three months.
She resembled a complete imbecile, with a vacant expressionless
face and dilated pupils. She was deaf, and quite blind. Her
mind was an absolute blank, and she was also paralysed in
the legs. The dilated pupil suggested brain anaemia or over-
action of the sympathetic with spasm of the blood vessels.
But her psychic visual area was apparently active, for she
drew beautifully, even though blind, whereas neither in the
normal, nor yet in any other abnormal state, could she draw.
One may therefore infer that this was some ancestral relic,
as Laycock called it, or latent mental talent called into action.
She was guided in drawing only by touch, as I proved by
holding a book between her eyes and the paper. Mr. Tweedy
kindly examined her eyes and found them normal. She would
also copy by touch, feeling written words with the left
forefinger. During these periods she returned once or twice
quite suddenly to the normal A, when all unfavourable symptoms
disappeared immediately.
At times she was so helpless that she could not steer a
cup or spoon to her mouth. She might drop the food over
her shoulder. The only way she could manage was to feel
along her arm and face till she reached her mouth. Her
parents could only communicate with her by touching her
with the tray or the food.
She has now settled down into the B 6 stage, and the
normal " A " has apparently gone entirely. She is like an
ordinary person of healthy mind, but delicate and with loss
of memory of all events previous to this B 6 personality, though
quite able to take her proper place in life.
Probably there was some slight damage to the brain, caused
by the influenza toxin, with resulting neurasthenia.
The chief points of interest in this case are :
(1) The ignorance of A with regard to B, and vice versa, and
the ignorance of the varying personalities of each other.
(2) The continuity of each substage. Thus B 3 left
once in December, returning in June, and then could
MAT, 1904. General Meeting. . . 235
not understand the flowers and long evenings., as to
her it was still December.
(3) The facility with which one personality was " switched
off" and another switched on, without apparent rhyme
or reason.
I do not regard it as a case of somnambulism, but would
suggest that just as the surface of the brain is mapped out into
functional areas, so the brain as a whole may be composed of
districts, each district representing a personality or small ego,
some good and some bad.
The moral is that we should try to encourage the good
personalities. If a bad personality present itself before us, we
cannot perhaps resist it in the sense of destroying it, for it
recurs ; but we may be able to replace it by " switching on "
a good personality. But if from any cause we lose control of
the " switch," then we become irresponsible and at the mercy
of the personality, which may be a bad one. The changes in
personality may be brought about through spasms in the
.various cerebral arteries,, causing a diminution in the supply of
blood to different areas.
When we apply the evidence of such cases as the one just
described to our daily experience, does it not affect .the question
of individual responsibility ? Bad air, unwholesome food, and
disease work havoc among the children of the poor. Worst
of all are the effects of drink through the parents. Thus
many a child is wrecked on the threshold of his existence.
His destined personality may be destroyed in infancy, and he
grows up in an abnormal personality of a lower grade. What
is our duty in dealing with him ?
Dr. K. Jones has called attention to the increasing physical
degeneration of our race. This case has some bearing on his
subject. Though not a degenerate, it illustrates how the in
stability of the normal Ego may destroy the original and true
personality, leaving other types good or bad. The whole sub
ject requires more extended investigation.
DR. K. JONES said that he had seen the case described, and
had been much struck with the accurate record and careful
notes made by Dr. Wilson, whose theory must, he thought, be
accepted for the present until some more satisfactory one was
brought forward.
236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, IJXM.
MK. A. F. SHAND suggested that the different stages might
be regarded as moods in which one or other emotion was
predominant rather than as distinct personalities. Thus in one
stage the emotion of fear and in another that of anger seemed
to absorb the whole consciousness. The subject, however, gave
herself different names in different stages as if she regarded
herself as different persons. He also thought that if Dr.
Wilson's theory that the changes were brought about by the
cutting off of the blood supply from various regions of the
brain was correct, it would have to be explained why there
was no atrophy of the brain substance in those regions which
were deprived of blood.
DR. LLOYD TUCKEY said that he had come across five or six
cases of dual or multiple personality ; the most recent was that
of an Oxford undergraduate, who disappeared from home and
after ten days sent a telegram from Malta asking for money
to bring him back. He remembered coming to himself in the
act of knocking a man down at Tunis ; probably the excite
ment had brought him round. Dr. Tuckey had seen Dr.
Wilson's case some years ago, and had tried to hypnotise the
girl without success.
THE HON. E. FEILDING asked if " Mary Barnes's " apparently
abnormal sense of sight was dependent on touch or if psychic
vision was present.
THE PRESIDENT referred to the case (published in the Pro
ceedings, Vol. IV., p. 230) of the son of a clergyman who was
subject for a time to attacks of secondary personality, during
which he did not know his own parents, but imagined they
were living in India; he lost the mathematical knowledge he
possessed, acquiring on the other hand a great increase in his
musical capacity. With regard to the extraordinary hyper-
Eeathesia of touch in Mary Barnes's case, he had met with the
same phenomenon in the case of a blind and deaf woman
(Mrs. Croad) whom he had visited at Bristol some years
ago, and who, at the time of his visit, could only be com
municated with through writing on her cheek. She knitted
in coloured wools, working coloured patterns, and said she
could distinguish the colours by touch. She could also
perceive pictures by touch when concealed by an intervening
screen. Apparently she could feel on a surface roughnesses
MAT, 1904. General Meeting. 237
which were only discernible to ordinary eyes through a
microscope.
DR. WILSON in reply to Mr. Shand's questions said the
subject did not originate the names by which she was called
in her different stages—they were suggested by her parents.
The brain-cells of the inactive regions of the brain would not
atrophy on his theory, as according to this the blood supply
to those regions was not entirely cut off, but only greatly
diminished. He thought it probable, however, that the super
ficial " embryonic " cells were somewhat damaged, since the
subject's memory was much impaired. There was no permanent
paralysis, but he imagined that there was a spasm of some of the
cerebral arteries, which only allowed enough blood to circulate
to keep the areas alive, but not active. The subject's present
condition was a fairly satisfactory one ; she had learnt type
writing, was now a lady's companion, and much valued in that
capacity. During her illness the doctors who tried to hypno
tise her had not been able to do so, but she occasionally
showed susceptibility to suggestion ; e.g. she could sometimes be
made to walk after being paralysed, but that might be because
the personality happened to be changing just then. In answer
to Mr. Feilding's question, as to her apparent power in the
abnormal state of seeing through a screen or by touch, he
thought that a heightened power of touch called up mental
pictures in her mind and so produced definite visual im
pressions.
TELEPATHIC EXPERIMENTS WITH DR. RICHARDSON.
IN the issues of Liyht of December 14th, 1901, and January
llth, 1902, there appeared accounts of certain experiments
in telepathy with Dr. R. F. Richardson of Nottingham, in which
successful results were claimed, and on July 17th, 1903,
there was published in the Daily Express, under startling
headlines, a report of experiments in " Long-distance Telepathy "
between London and Nottingham, the proceedings at the London
end taking place at the office of the Review of Reviews, under
the control of a committee summoned by Mr. W. T. Stead.
Mr. Stead has since, through the medium of an American news
paper, stated that these experiments have convinced him of the
reality of long-distance telepathy.
238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, i9w.
Dr. Richardson, having recently invited the S. P. R. to hold
some experiments with him, a Committee consisting of Miss
Alice Johnson, Mr. W. W. Baggally, Lt.-Col. Le Mesurier
Taylor, and the Hon. E. Feilding, assembled on February 18th
last to meet Dr. Richardson and two " sensitives," Mr. and
Mrs. S., who came up from Nottingham for the purpose. It
was decided that no long-distance tests should be attempted,
as experiments between two rooms in the same house were
more easily controllable, and if successful would be of almost
equal interest. Dr. Richardson claims to be able, by means of
a sudden gesture of his arm, accompanied by an effort of the
will, to convey an impulse or thrill to a distant sensitive.
By means of a code, based on the number of such thrills, an
intelligent message may be sent, as by the Morse system. He
claims that if the two -rooms are connected by an electric bell,
of which the sounder is in the room with the Committee, the
sensitive in the other room will be able to notify, by means
of the bell, the sending of a thrill from the Committee room.
Further, that by application of the code, the sensitive will be
able to determine which, out of a choice of various numbers,
words, or objects, has been selected by the Committee. Dr.
Richardson had prepared a programme of his experiments, to
which the Committee agreed to adhere. This programme com
prised the following experiments :
(1) "Vibratory test," wherein the sensitive would notify
by means of a bell the instant at which a thrill had been
sent, provided that such thrill should be sent at a moment
indicated by one of the Committee within a certain limit of
time from the commencement of the experiment, the limit
being for the first experiment one minute, for the second two
minutes, and for the third three minutes.
(2) "Time test," similar to the above, the sensitive indicating
by the bell a particular time at which the bell should ring,
chosen in advance by the Committee.
(3) " Number test," wherein the choice of one out of five
numbers offered to the Committee for selection would be indi
cated. These numbers were 579, 555, 666, 777, and 888, being
numbers in which Dr. Richardson stated he had always practised.
(4) " Metal test," in which the sensitive would state which
out of three coins, copper, silver, and gold, had been chosen.
MAT, 1904. Telepathic Experiments ivith Dr. Richardson. 239
(5) " Coin Valuation test," in which a selection of one out
of seven coins of various denominations would be notified.
Dr. Eichardson stated that success was almost invariable, and
that the truth of his claims would be demonstrated beyond any
question. The experiments were made variously with Dr. Eichard
son, Mr. S., and Mrs. S., acting in turn as agent and percipient.
In view of the small measure of success obtained, the following
is probably a sufficiently full account of the proceedings :
(1) Time test, (a) Time chosen, 6.23. No ring till 6.27,
when test was abandoned. Eesult, failure.
(6) Time chosen, 6.33J. Bell rings at 6.35£.
Eesult, 2 mins. too late.
(2) Number test. Number chosen by lot out of five alterna
tives, 579. Answer, 579. Eesult, correct. It will
be noticed that in this test the probability against
success was 4 to 1.
(3) Metal test, (a) Metal chosen, out of three alternatives,
gold. Answer, copper. Eesult, failure.
(b) Metal chosen, copper. Answer, silver.
Eesult, failure. Here the chances
against success were only 2 to 1.
(4) Vibratory test (see description above).
(a) Limit allowed, one minute. Eesult, bell rings
15" after signal.
(b) Limit allowed, two minutes. Eesult, bell rings
55" after signal.
(c) Limit allowed, three minutes. Eesult, bell rings 30"
too soon, i.e. before the signal was given at all.
(5) Time test, (a) Bell rings before any time chosen at all.
(b) Misunderstanding ; no certain result.
(c) Time chosen, 7.5. Mrs. S., who is acting
as agent, sends thrill. No answer. Dr.
E. then says he will try. Eesult, answer
comes 1 5" afterwards.
(6) Number test. Number chosen by lot, out of 5 alterna
tives, 555. Answer, 666. Eesult, failure.
(7) Metal test. Metal chosen, out of 3 alternatives, gold.
Answer, gold. Eesult, correct.
240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1904
(8) Vibratory test, (a) Limit allowed, one minute. Answer.
30" after signal.
(V) Limit allowed, two minutes. Answer,
10" after signal.
(c) Limit allowed, three minutes. An
swer, immediate.
(9) Time test. Time chosen, 7.57J. Answer, 1 minute
afterwards.
(10) Number test, (a) Number chosen by lot, out of 7
alternatives (viz. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), 3. Answer,
4. Result, failure.
(6) Number chosen, 9. Answer, 7.
Eesult, failure. Here the chances
against success are 6 to 1.
(11) Metal test, (a) Metal chosen, out of 3 alternatives,
copper. Answer, Gold. Eesult, failure.
(&) Metal chosen, copper. Answer, gold.
Eesult, failure.
(c) Metal chosen, gold. Answer, gold.
Eesult, correct.
(12) Coin Valuation test, (a) Coin chosen, out of 7 alterna
tives, a shilling. Answer, silver, half-a-crown.
Eesult, partly correct.
(6) Coin chosen, a florin. Answer,
gold. Eesult, failure. The
chances against complete suc
cess (i.e. both metal and coin)
are again 6 to 1.
(13) Dr. Eichardson then went into the adjoining room
saying that he would be able telepathically to
announce as soon as one of the Committee had taken
up one of the coins left on the table. The Com
mittee deliberately did nothing, in order to test the
effect of expectation. Two trials were made, but on
each occasion he notified that a coin had been taken
up. Eesult, two failures.
It will be seen that the above experiments do not show
successful results in a higher proportion than might be expected
according to the laws of chance.
MAT, 1904. Telepathic Experiments tvi.th Dr. Richardson. 241
It is true that in a certain number of cases in the vibratory
test the bell rang almost coincidentally with the giving of the
signal. It also sometimes rang before it and sometimes a
considerable time after. When it rang too late, it was explained
that the message sometimes takes a certain time to go through.
When it rang before, it was explained that the percipients were
too nervous or had misunderstood the directions. And when
it rang coincidentally, success was claimed.
In view of the unsatisfactory results of the experiments,
Dr. Eichardson offered to repeat them the following week, and,
in deference to the Committee's criticism that from such a
miscellaneous character of tests, in which the chances of success
always varied, no certain conclusions could easily be arrived
at, he agreed to confine himself to attempting to transmit a
series of numbers, from 3 to 23 inclusive. The numbers
were placed in a bowl, and one was drawn at random by a
member of the Committee. After each experiment the number
used was put back into the bowl, all the numbers were
shuffled, and again one was drawn at random from the bowl,
and so on. The chances against success would thus in each
experiment be 19 to 1. On February 25th, a Committee
consisting of Mr. J. G. Piddington, Miss Johnson, Mr. Baggally,
and the Hon. E. Feilding, accordingly assembled to meet Dr.
Eichardson and Mr. and Mrs. S. The following is the result
of the experiments :
No. chosen. Percipient's reply. No. chosen. Percipient's reply.

11 4 10 11
16 15 10 6
17 4 11 14
•f*
i.e., out of a series of 10 experiments, there was no success.
Dr. Eichardson stated that the failure of the experiments on
the first occasion was probably due to the nervousness of his
assistants,—a nervousness which indeed was very perceptible,—
and on the second occasion, to the novelty of the experiment,
which he had not previously practised. It must be pointed
out, however, that if the vibratory sensations experienced by
the percipients have any objective existence outside their own
imaginations, they should, by means of the code, be applicable
242 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1904.
to the transmission of numbers as well as of other things.
So far as these experiments justify them in coming to a
conclusion, the Committee are of opinion that Dr. Eichardsou's
claims are not substantiated.
There is not the slightest suspicion of any attempt at fraud
or collusion either on the part of Dr. Eichardson, or of the
two sensitives. Dr. Eichardson, however, exhibited a singular
illogicality of reasoning, and while it may be that the experi
ments held with the Committee were unusually unsuccessful,
they are of opinion that the true explanation of his claims
will be found in chance coincidences, combined with the
insufficient attention paid by him to the frequently imaginative
character of sensations felt by percipients (which, as the Com
mittee found, could easily be produced in them by expectation)
and the absence of a consistent and methodical way of con
ducting his experiments.
The Committee express their thanks to Dr. Eichardson and to
Mr. and Mrs. S. for the time and trouble they have expended in
affording the Society an opportunity of experimenting with them.

I was present only during the greater part of the first evening
of the experiments above described ; the impression left on my
mind by what I then observed was, that there were some slight
indications of impulses having been transmitted from agent to
percipient ; but taking the nature of the report of the second

that my impression was a wrong one.—LE M. T.
PEOFESSOE NEWCOMB ON "THE GEOEGIA MAGNET."
A COPY of the January Journal, containing an article on the
references in Professor Simon Newcomb's Reminiscences of an
Astronomer to the performances of the " little Georgia Magnet,"
having been sent by Dr. Hodgson to Professor Newcomb, he
MAT, 1904. Professor Newcomb on " The Georgia Magnet." 243
wrote in reply the following letter, which Dr. Hodgson sends
us:—
WASHINGTON, February 1, 1904.
DEAR MR. HODGSON,
I am much obliged to you for the pamphlets you
send me, containing a letter from Sir Oliver Lodge to the effect
that a passage in my Reminiscences of an Astronomer has led to the
"natural inference that the late F. W H. Myers and the Society
for Psychical Research were misled into supposing that the ingenious
mechanical tricks of a person called by her exploiters 'the little
Georgia Magnet,' some years ago were attributable to supernormal
power; and that they are publishing this inference as if it were
true."
By what logical process such an inference can be drawn is beyond
my power to conceive. The account which I give of my experience
with Miss Lula Hurst in 1884 has no mention of nor allusion to
either Mr. Myers or the Society of Psychical Kesearch, unless you
regard my fixing the date as shortly after Professor Fitzgerald's
visit to this country to constitute such an allusion. Even psychical
research is not mentioned in the account, except to exclude it by
the remark "a wonder as great as anything recorded in the annals
of psychical research or spiritualism, etc.," my meaning being that
here was something which, lying quite outside the realm of psychical
research or spiritualism, being purely mechanical, was as wonderful
as if it had been within that realm. The only gentlemen to whom
I alluded as being in any way misled or interested in the matter
were some Washington scientific men who, being invited to see the
performance, thought it something very wonderful.
Whether the Mrs. Abbott, whose performances in England came
off several years later, and of whom I hear now for the first time,
was Miss Lula Hurst, 1 have no means of knowing. There were
certainly great resemblances between the two performances. But
as I remember Miss Hurst, she was tall, broad-shouldered and muscular,
while Mrs. Abbott is described as short, small and frail in appearance.
Moreover, a newspaper paragraph, which has appeared some time in the
interval, stated that Miss Hurst had lost her supposed wonderful powers.
To recapitulate : how an account of a single performance in
Washington City, before even the American Society for Psychical
Research was organised, and when the British Society was almost
unknown among us, without any allusion to either Society, or bringing
in the names of any one connected with the British Society, except
in the way that I have mentioned, could have led to the inference
that I was reflecting on Mr. Myers of the British Society, etc., etc.,
is beyond my comprehension.
Will you kindly send this letter to the Society with authority to
make any use of it that will correct the impression in question.

PROPOSED MEMORIAL TO DR. LIEBEAULT.
THE last number of the Journal contained a brief notice of the
life and work of the great French doctor to whom—more perhaps
than to any other man—the revival of Hypnotism in the last
25 years is due. In the Eevue de VHypnotisme for March,
Dr. Berillon announces that at the suggestion of Dr. van
Renterghem -of Amsterdam, a subscription list has been ' opened
with the view of founding some memorial to Dr. Lie"beault in
the town of Nancy, where all his professional life was spent.
In the April number of the Revue, a number of press notices
about Dr. Liebeault are quoted, and the first list of subscriptions
is published, headed with contributions of 100 francs each
from the Societe d'Hypnologie et de Psychologic de Paris, M.
Bichon, Dr. van Renterghem, Dr. Lloyd Tuckey, and Dr. Berillon,
together with many smaller sums from medical men, psychologists,
and students.
We think that some among our own members who are
specially interested in hypnotism may be glad to contribute to
the memorial. Subscriptions should be sent to DR. E. BERILLOX,
editor of the Revue de I'Hypnotisms, 4 Rue Castellane, Paris.
ENDOWMENT FUND FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.
The following donations, in addition to those already
announced in the Journal, have been received or promised :
The Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, M.P., - £100.
Mrs. Wilkins, - - £1.
We need hardly say that we value highly Mr. Balfour's
endorsement of the objects of this Fund ; and we hope that
the generosity of the Prime Minister, whom we have the
honour of numbering among our former Presidents, will be
imitated by other members of the Society ; and that thereby
the success of Mr. Morris Hudson's scheme for raising within
the year £1000 towards the completion of the Endowment
Fund may be assured.

HYPNOTISM :
ITS HISTORY, PRACTICE, AND THEORY.
Br J. MILNE BRAMWELL, M.B., C.M.
SDO. 47'8 pages. 18*. net.
The chief aim of this monograph is to draw the attention of medical men
to the therapeutic value of Hypnotism. The author gives the results of
twelve years of his own practice and research, with personal observations
of the work done in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and
Belgium.
The historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively
little known work of the English pioneers, Elliotsou, Esdaile, and Braid,
while the final chapter of references contains much information which has
not hitherto been-published in accessible form.
The methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and
instructions given in regard to the management of the hypnotic state, with
details as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis. Hypnotic theories are
described and discussed, and special prominence is given to Mr. Myers's
theory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the
problems of hypnotism.

PPJVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND
ASSOCIATES.
THE seventh of the series of private meetings for Members
and Associates only was held in the large Hall at 20
Hanover Square, London, W., on Monday, May 9th, 1904,
at 4.15 p.m.; the President, Professor W. F. Barrett, in the
chair.
MRS. A. W. VERRALL read a paper on " Experiments in
Motor Automatism," of which the following is an abstract :
Table tilting was the method employed in the experiments
described, which took place during August and September,
1903. A complete record of the sittings was made at the
time by Mrs. Verrall, who was present. In all the sixteen
sittings Miss H. de G. Verrall acted as automatist ; in eleven
sittings the other automatist was the Rev. M. A. Bayfield, a
248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, I<KM.
member of the S.l'.K. The table used was a small but
heavy oak table on four legs ; the usual code was adopted,
and the tilts were obtained by the table rising on two legs
and bringing the other two down on the floor, the hands of
both sitters resting upon the table.
The answers to questions and sentences spontaneously pro
duced were very various, and largely consisted of long
consecutive sentences in English, Latin and Greek, prose and
verse, claiming to be quotations unknown to the sitters, and
capable of verification. These three languages were known
to both sitters. English and Latin were used indifferently
as a medium of communication between " the table " and the
sitters, the transition from one to the other being unex
pected and inexplicable, but serving to prevent the sitters
from following what was tilted as easily as if one language
had been regularly used. On one occasion what purported
to be Finnish was given, with a translation, this language
being unknown to all the persons present; but when Spanish
was asked for, that being known to one of the sitters, mere
rubbish was obtained, and no translation offered.
On the first occasion, and only then, was there any
attempt at personification on the part of the table. Asked
who had given some names and addresses, which were the
first words obtained, it said " I," and gave its name as
" Wilhelm." It carried out the suggestion of the name by
a remark later on in German ; the names and addresses
originally given turned out to be incorrect, and this was the
last of " Wilhelm." No further personification was made.
At the next sitting " the table," after saying that it was
not the subliminal consciousness of either sitter nor a dis
embodied spirit, claimed to be the " sub. of both " ; on a later
occasion, after saying that it did not know how it received
impressions, it added : " Thoughts fly, that is how I know ;
I am the recipient of world films."
From experiments made and observations recorded, it was
clear that though Miss Verrall was an important factor in all
the sittings, she was by no means the sole factor; the results
were affected by the personality of the other sitter ; e.g.
references were made to things in the mind of the other
sitter, and not known to Miss Verrall, and tricks of spelling
JCNE, 1904. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 249
of the second sitter were reproduced. On one occasion the
table seemed to present in a confused fashion a thought that
had been in the mind of one of the tilters just before the
tilting, though it did not reproduce it directly ; but generally
speaking no connexion could be traced between the thoughts
of the tilters and the results obtained.
In the whole series of sixteen sittings five instances of
apparent telepathy occurred, information being given which
was known to some other person in the room or house, but
not to the tilters ; and there were two instances where
statements subsequently found to be correct were made, con
veying information unknown to any one in the neighbourhood,
and therefore seeming to be explicable rather by clairvoyance
than by telepathy. These instances were described in detail,
the most interesting being as follows : After undertaking to
give a quotation unknown to both tilters and capable of sub
sequent verification, and then selecting the language (Greek)
and the author (Pausanias), the table reproduced a Greek
sentence of twenty-three words, followed without break by the
words in English " end going." The meaning of the supposed
extract is : " Strangers are rioting in all the mountains, for
they deserve punishment. Socrates says that strangers could
not enter into the city after the sun had set." The sentence
falls into two parts, the language and phraseology of the first
part being that of the Epic, while that of the latter part is
the ordinary idiom of prose, the difference of style being em
phasised by the use of different forms for the word " strangers "
(xeinoi and .rcnoi), which occurs in both parts of the sentence.
In reply to questions, the table gave as the exact reference
Pausanias, book vi., chap. 17; but on investigation it
appeared, as was expected from acquaintance with Pausauias,
that nothing like the passage in question was contained in
Pausanias, vi., 17.
The next day the table gave the name of the author of
the quotation as Heliodorus, and again, later on, it repeated
that Heliodorus was the author, and corrected the reference
from vi., 17 to vi., 12. A copy of Heliodoms, obtained on
a librarian's order from the University library, was consulted,
and it appeared that book vi., chap. 12, contains the account
of the arrival of a young man and a maiden outside a town
250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, ISKH.
about sunset. They speak to an old woman there, and after
a time, on proposing to enter the town, are told that as
strangers they cannot enter at that hour, and accordingly
they have to wait to go into the city till the next morning.
The resemblance between the incident described in Heliodorus,
vi., 12, and the latter half of the sentence given by the
table is undeniable, and the incident seems too definite for
the resemblance to be ascribed to accident. Heliodorus, a
late writer, is not necessarily known to students of the
classics, and neither of the tilters is believed to have read
his novel. It is certain that Miss Verrall had no opportu
nity of doing so, and Mr. Bayfield, if he ever saw the passage,
must have done so by accident some thirty years ago. The
recovery from his memory of the substance, but not the
words, of the incident, with the exact reference, would seem
not easily paralleled as an instance of revived memory. No
theory to explain this curious incident is suggested. Not
the least puzzling part of it is the appearance of the long
Greek statement falling naturally into two parts, and the
subsequent verification of the latter half only ; no efforts were
able to obtain any clue to the rest of the sentence.
On the whole, the experience of this series of sittings led
the sitters to the conclusion that better results were obtained
from encouraging the " table " to tilt out sentences with as
little questioning on the part of the sitters as possible ; the
" table " was ready enough to answer questions, but the
answers were more fluent than correct.
At the close of the paper tea was served, after which
there was a discussion.
Miss GRIGNON, referring to the passage quoted from
Heliodorus, which was thought to be unknown to either of the
sitters, asked whether it was not possible that this might be
quoted in some book on some totally different subject, where
one of the sitters might have come across it.
MR. FEILDING inquired as to the type of quotation given
spontaneously, and also whether the original matter given was
of any literary interest.
SIR LAWRENCE JONES asked whether the sitters had received
any personal messages, or whether they had been given names
or soubriquets by the table.
JUNK, 1904. Private Meeting for Members and Axnociatef<. 251
MRS. VEKKALL, in reply, said that—
(1) With regard to the passage from Heliodorus, they had
not been able to discover any passages in other books quoted
from Heliodorus except a reference to a scene of incanta
tion, which followed soon after the passage quoted by the table,
but it was, of course, impossible to say that none existed.
(2) The quotations given were in Latin, English, or Greek.
There were some lines of Latin verse, but the original matter
was not beyond what might have been produced, she thought,
by the sitters themselves.
(3) The table had given no personal messages, and the
sitters had not been given names or soubriquets.
In reply to further questions, MRS. YERRALL said that the
method used had been that of spelling out the alphabet,
the right letters being indicated by the cessation of the move
ment. The letters were not always spoken aloud, and on one
occasion, when, not having her hands on the table, she had
repeated them to herself, a long Latin sentence had been
correctly given. The sitters had not, on any of these occa
sions, obtained movements without contact, though the move
ments of the table were often more violent than they would
have • expected to produce themselves. It tilted occasionally
with extreme rapidity, and sometimes seemed to be trying to
get into the sitters' laps. No physical phenomena had been
obtained, though the table had expressed its ability to pro
duce them. On one occasion, having said that it would
move a pencil on another table some little distance away, it
produced the desired result by moving violently and hitting
Mrs. Verrall's foot (she being on this occasion one of the tillers),
which caused her to knock against the table on which the
pencil lay, and start it rolling, whereupon the table declared
its attempt to be a success.
Much of the matter given was nonsensical, and sometimes
names and addresses were given which were entirely incorrect,
and known to be so at the time.
The intelligence of the table did not seem to correspond with
the intelligence of the sitters, and in replying to questions
asked it often answered what was actually said rather than
what was meant.
THE PRESIDENT, commenting on the paper, said that he
252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1904.
thought it had an added value in the admirable method of in
vestigation followed by Mrs. Verrall. It was open to all Members
of the Society to carry out experiments on similar lines, and he
would urge them to do so, and to record their results, as
every genuine record of this kind might turn out to be of
value. Mrs. Verrall's paper seemed to illustrate the import
ance of leaving the production of these phenomena to the
subliminal self, instead of trying to interfere with or control
them through the conscious self. Finally he would urge on
experimenters not to be alarmed at the results obtained, nor
to set them down either to electricity or the devil—two
not uncommon methods of explaining such phenomena, neither
of which, he need hardly say, would be found able to account
for the facts observed.
CORRECTION.
WE are sometimes accused of over great caution in our treat
ment of the reports of apparently supernormal phenomena
that reach us, of an excessive and unnecessary desire to
obtain corroboration of the statements of obviously respectable
persons, and of abstaining from the publication of cases as
long as there is any reasonable probability of obtaining more
evidence. It is true that publication is sometimes postponed
for several months—occasionally even for two or three years—
on account of the time spent in getting answers to our en
quiries about cases. But that these precautions are generally
desirable is shown by the following instance, in which they
were partially relaxed.
In the Journal for February, 1904, p. 187, was printed
an account of an apparition seen by Mr. J. Osborne. The
account itself was uncorroborated, but there was unusually
strong evidence of the writer's bona fides, as vouched for by
the County Magistrate who contributed the case, and a
Member of our Council who interviewed the percipient.
We have since had further opportunities of investigating
the account, which is now shown to be partially incorrect,
the accident with which the apparition was supposed to be
associated having happened many years earlier than the per
cipient stated, and not in the place described by him.
We feel bound to print this correction, though we have
JUNE, 1904. Correction. 253
no doubt that Mr. Osborne, in giving his account, stated
what he fully believed at the time to be true. It appears
that, with every intention of being accurate, he made the
common mistake of exaggerating in recollection the degree of
coincidence between his experience and the event with which
he believed it to be related.
Mr. Osborne himself wrote to us on February 8th, 1904,
as follows :—
In reply to yours of the 4th I beg to say that, as near as I can
fix, the date you ask for [i.e. the date when he saw the apparition]
is the end of March or beginning of April, 1895.
The accident must have happened just before, as the woman I
was staying with knew the man from my description of him, and
then suddenly remembered that he had been killed.
I did not trouble to make any enquiry, but for a good time after
felt considerably unnerved. JAMES OSBORNE.
P.S.—I knew nothing at all of the affair; was just there for a
few days on business, a perfect stranger, knowing no one whatever.
We had at first understood the letters of Mr. K. (from
whom we obtained the case) to imply that he himself had
an independent knowledge of the accident, but he afterwards
told us that this was not so, and gave us the name of the
woman with whom Mr. Osborne lodged on the occasion.
One of our members, Mr. T. H. Davis, then kindly under
took to visit this woman and reported to us on February 21st,
1904, as follows:
I visited Wolverton on Friday, 19th inst
From the directions I gathered that Mrs. Merritt would be living
somewhere between Wolverton station and Newport Pagnell ; 1
therefore made that district the locality for my first enquiries, but
without success. I was unable to find any one of that name who
had lived there within the memory of any of those of whom I
made enquiry. I decided upon staying the night, and pursuing my
enquiries in the other direction on the following day.
Wolverton is a railway town ; its chief and practically only in
dustry is that of railway carriage building for the L. & N. W.
Eailway Company. I therefore made enquiry among men connected
with the carriage works, and ultimately succeeded in tracing Mrs.
Merritt. Mrs. Merritt's address is 578 Young Street, Wolverton ; has
lived in the same house over 20 years, and in and about Wolverton over
254 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, ISKM.
40 years. Young Street is in Wolverton, and on the Wolverton side
of the station, Newport Pagnell being in the opposite direction. It is
within five minutes' walk of the station, but stands back from the main
road at right angles some 200 yards, the market house intervening.
Mrs. Merritt appears a good witness, an intelligent woman some
where about 60 years of age, rather under than over. She remembers
Mr. Osborne perfectly, volunteering the information that he was a
painter from Oxford ; he lodged with her for (probably) two or three
weeks, some years ago, but unable to say exact year. Mrs. Merritt
knows nothing whatever of the story; she made no such remark to
Mr. Osborne, neither did she ever hear of any such accident, and
had one occurred she would be sure to have heard of it. She
has heard a story to the effect that very many years ago a
man named Eichard Ratclifl'e, a farmer, was killed by a horse in a
hay-field, and that people used to say his ghost had been seen near
the locality, some miles away from Wolverton.
(I could obtain no other corroboration of this story.)
Some months after Mr. Osborne had lived with her he came again :
this would, she thinks, be either in October or November of the same
year, and as she, Mrs. Merritt, could not accommodate him on that
occasion, she sent him across the street to a neighbour, Mrs. Newbold.
Mr. Osborne had gone to Wolverton to do some work at the
station in connection with the "Sunlight soap" advertisements.
I called upon Mrs. Newbold at No. 631 Young Street. Mrs. New-
bold is somewhat older than Mrs. Merritt, but a woman of intel
ligence and clear faculties ; she also remembered Mr. Osborne
perfectly, and, like Mrs. Merritt, volunteered the information that
he was a painter from Oxford.
Mr. Osborne, who was accompanied by his son, a youth named
Ronald, lodged with Mrs. Newbold one night—it is some years
since, she cannot say how many, perhaps eight years or so ; he had
some painting work to do at the station, something to do with
" Sunlight soap." She knows nothing whatever of the story, neither
did she ever hear of any such accident having occurred.
Mrs. Newbold has lived in Wolverton 39 years, 27 of which have
been passed in her present house.
Young Street appears to be one of many similar streets of small
houses built by the L. & N. W. Railway Company for the accom
modation of their workmen and their families.
I made enquiries of several people in Wolverton, but none had
ever heard of the supposed accident. T. H. DAVIS.

Writing a few days later, Mr. Davis adds :
... I think it possible the case is explicable somewhat on the
lines you indicate [i.e. on the hypothesis of some illusion of memory].
Memory has, in my opinion, also played Mr. Osborne false in regard
to the locale of the hallucination, unless before proceeding straight
to his lodgings from the station, as implied in his account, he took
a walk in the opposite direction.
And, probably, again in respect to the time, i.e. there would
appear to be some confusion as to whether it occurred on the
occasion of his first prolonged visit to \Volverton, or that of his
second and much shorter one ; if the latter, then on that occasion
Mrs. Newbold would be his landlady. . . .
Mr. Davis afterwards wrote to Mr. Osborne, asking for
an interview, in the hope of being able to clear up the dis
crepancies in the various accounts, but Mr. Osborne refused
to see him or to give any further information in the affair.

ON THE TYPES OF PHENOMENA DISPLAYED IN MRS. THOMPSON'S
TRANCE.
To the Editor of the
JOURNAL OF THK SOCIETY FOK PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.
NEW YORK, February 12th, 1904.
Mr. Piddington's paper on the " Types of Phenomena displayed
in Mrs. Thompson's Trance" has been one of unusual interest to
me for such facts as help to throw light upon the complications
of the problem with which psychic research has to deal. But it
has one serious defect for the scientific psychologist, and this is
the absence of detailed record of matter that is not supernormal.
The critical student really obtains no adequate conception of non
sensical matter at the sittings in such accounts as are published.
It is well to have the paper that Mr. Piddington has written.
This should not be omitted, but I think the Report would have
been infinitely better if we had been given a much more detailed
record of the sittings. I do not believe that we shall ever get
at the foundations of this problem until this is done. After all
256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUSK, i!K)4.
the evidence of the supernormal that has been published, it is
exceedingly important to have with it the mass of irrelevant and
nonsensical matter that is found associated with this supernormal. I
am of the opinion that many of the perplexities which Mr. Piddington
had to encounter in his study of the case would appear less
troublesome, if the psychologist could have had a stenographic
account of absolutely all that was said and done. Sometimes the
nonsense is more valuable to the psychologist than the sense and
the supernormal. I have generally found this to be the case.
We shall never understand the place of secondary personality and
subliminal action until we get these details.
Too many inquirers have lost the true scientific interest in
secondary personality in the presence of a hope of supernormal
phenomena, when the whole history of our work shows that the
majority of its results has been associated with much chaff, and
that the chaff shows the conditions in which we have to conduct
our investigations. This is so true that I have about come to
the conclusion that I shall pay very little attention to any dis
cussions that are not accompanied by detailed records. The
complications of subconscious action, mental and neural, are so
great and are so associated with the glimpses of the supernormal
that we get now and then, that we need to know them in order
to protect both ourselves and the public from illusion as to meaning
of the supernormal itself.
The illustration of this need will be found in what Mr. Pidding
ton says regarding the phenomena that have suggested to him his
frequent comparison of Mrs. Thompson's trance with Mrs. Piper's.
Mr. Piddington has observed both the resemblances and the
differences between the two, but he has not remarked the true
significance of the differences. The general conception of the
" trance " has prevented the discovery of that meaning. So far
as I can see, Mr. Piddington seems to assume that the " trance "
in each case is of the same type and the differences are in the
contents of what is said and recorded. These differences of subject
matter have been noted, and they consist of evident interpenetra-
tion of normal and abnormal mental processes and material. Mr.
Piddington has often remarked the intromission into the " trance "
utterances of Mrs. Thompson of facts known to her normal or
supraliminal consciousness, a phenomenon quite well known in
secondary personality. Now it is the bearing of this fact on the
real nature of the " trance " that ought to have been observed,
and all that occurred in connection with events ought to have
JUNE, 190-4. Comespondeiice. 257
been recorded and published. Here is the point where all the
nonsense ought to have been remarked and cherished as a precious
jewel. Here is where the whole difference between the cases of
Mrs. Thompson and Mrs. Piper is to be found. It is apparent
to me that Mrs. Thompson's "trance" is often, perhaps mainly,
identical with Mrs. Piper's " subliminal I," as denominated by Dr.
Hodgson, and that it is in any case fundamentally different from
that of the Piper record. It is not easy to determine the point
where " subliminal I " passes into " subliminal II," or rice rerta,
but the characteristic difference between them is the fact that the
matter "communicated" in "subliminal II" is of the automatic
type and represents the casual admission of thoughts and " messages "
on the " other side." " Subliminal I " represents Mrs. Piper in
the mental attitude of an observer of events on the "other
side " with the retention more or less of her own individuality,
and the occasional intromission of secondary personality elements
of her normal experience or even of a sensory impression at the
time, as I remember once she asked, as she came out of the
trance, if we heard that whistle, a postman's whistle having just
blown. But " subliminal I " represents the transitional stage of
the trance through secondary personality, and usually just far
enough away to escape sensory consciousness of the ordinary kind
and individuality enough to escape the automatic condition and
rapport with the transcendental world, so to speak.
Now it seems to me that Mrs. Thompson's "trance" fluctuates
between two conditions, one intermediate between the normal and
Mrs. Piper's "subliminal I," and the other between Mrs. Piper's
"subliminal I" and "subliminal II," the latter representing the
occasional access of an automatic condition to the influences in
volving supernormal knowledge. Here is where it would have been
most important to have had a full record of what was said and
done by Mrs. Thompson. It is true that we have a detailed
record of the case published in the Proceedings (Vol. XVII.), but
Mr. Piddington has in the present paper of his called attention
to the fact that certain portions of that record were omitted,
because they would "have interrupted and confused the main
narrative." But I must contend that their omission only confuses
the psychologist in getting a correct conception of what actually
went on at the time, and though it may not be necessary to the
" main narrative " materially to have omitted what has now been
rescued, the omission suggests that at least one important resemblance
to the Piper sittings was not noticed at the time, or at least not
258 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1904.
clearly made known. This resemblance is in the fact of irrelevant
" messages," in so far as the sitter is concerned at the time, but
still relevant to some previous sitter. This has been very common
in the Piper record, especially in the Phinuit days. This omission,
now redeemed by Mr. Piddington's act of penitence, suggests that
much may have been omitted that would throw light on the
problem of the " trance " in the case. Whether this is the case
or not is not made clear in either Report on Mrs. Thompson.
It may have been impossible under the circumstances to have
taken the desired record. I am not contending here that it was
inexcusable, or that the matter was evidently there for record,
but only that we have no evidence that the real problem was
sufficiently appreciated to keep on the look out for the facts which
I should like to have known, and the disposition to suppress parts
of the record not bearing upon the " main narrative " rather shows
a tendency to neglect what I must regard as one of the most
important parts of the whole question. What I would like to
know is the actual nonsense that was uttered at various times.
I know the difficulties in getting this when we cannot have a
rapid stenographer present, as we have to note first the facts
possibly bearing upon the supernormal, and this was recognised in
the first Report on the case (Vol. XVII., p. 88). But whatever
the difficulties of making the record what it should be, there is
no harm in calling attention to a defect in it and to the great
importance now of paying careful attention to the nonsense of
such cases, especially as this nonsense will be the key to the
nature of the trance and will show the psychological processes
involved in the study of mediumistic phenomena. I feel confident
that, if they had been remarked in this instance, we should under
stand Mrs. Thompson's case much better and be able to present
a tolerable theory why the subject matter of the "communications"
is so different from the peculiar character of Mrs. Piper's " messages."
There is all through Mrs. Thompson's case evidence of greater
difficulty in getting access to the kind of supernormal information
shown in Mrs. Piper's later trances under the Imperator regime.
I have never had the importance of nonsensical " messages " so
emphasised as I feel them in this case. The Smead Case which
I have been investigating makes this contention clear. Its chief value
lies in its non-evidential matter and its borderland character, more
removed from the normal consciousness than Mrs. Thompson and
with less access to supernormal information than Mrs. Thompson,
or at least to evidentially supernormal knowledge.
JUNK, 1904. Correspondence, 259
I think the various phases and phenomena of secondary personality
are going to be, in the future of psychical research, quite as im
portant as, perhaps more important than, the fact of the supernormal.
If this be true, everything that abnormal psychology can supply us
with must be observed with care equal to that applied to other
phenomena. If the cases are those of automatic writing, we must
be careful to note every mechanical feature of the process and all
pauses, scrawls, and motor phenomena accessible to observation and
such as are discoverable only by the sphygmograph and other instru
ments. I have now under my observation a case of subliminal
action which varies somewhat with the normal and the anaemic
condition of the hand. When that shows a normal circulation of
the blood the writing is one thing, and when it is anaemic the
writing is often another, though the variations are not wholly
dependent upon this feature of the case. But what we know of
physiology throws light upon the difficulties of the problem, and
that is now our main task in our understanding of the super
normal. The psychological nature of the " messages " will show
what our difficulties are in the influence of secondary personality
and its limitations in the access to what transcends it. In the
study of this we must know everything that occurs, and especially
the nonsense. Nothing but the most detailed record will supply
our wants, and general discussion and narration of supernormal
incidents will avail nothing to clear up our difficulties in such
cases. What was wanted in the case of Mrs. Thompson was the
publication of the details in the original Report, and then such
discussion as we now have from Mr. Piddington, and if that
detailed record had been more complete than it apparently is, so
much the better for science, especially on the fundamental question
of the nature of the "trance" and its- comparison with that of
Mrs. Piper, and I must say that this is now one of our most
important tasks. JAMES H. HYSLOP.
I have to thank Professor Hyslop for sending me, in the first
instance, his letter intended for the Journal, and I avail myself of
the opportunity thus afforded to append my reply.
Professor Hyslop's whole criticism is, I think, founded on a mis
conception of the object which I had in view in writing my paper,
and his adverse comments are due to his assuming that I was attacking
certain psychological problems which interest him, but which for the
immediate purposes of my paper I did not allow to interest me. I
deliberately confined myself, as Professor Hyslop will see if he will
260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1904.
refer to pp. 111-112, to an attempt to classify the phenomena iu
order to test their consistency, and I deliberately refrained from
discussing the source of the communications, and only incidentally
did I discuss the ' evidential ' value of certain of the incidents
narrated. Whatever view may be taken of Mrs. Thompson's trance
utterances, it is not open to question that they approximate more
nearly to the evidential standard of Mrs. Piper's than those of almost
any other medium. If, then, Dr. Hodgson is right in suspecting the
genuineness of Mrs. Thompson's trance, grave doubt must fall on
Mrs. Piper's. Hence it seemed to me important to debate this single
question : Are Mrs. Thompson's phenomena spontaneous or spurious ?
And this, I thought, might be done by trying to test them by classi
fication, and by excluding other issues.
With regard to other points raised by Professor Hyslop, I would
remark that :—
(1) The critical student would obtain from my paper a more
than adequate conception of the proportion of nonsensical
matter contained in Mrs. Thompson's trance utterances.
(2) Except where noted, the records are practically verbatim ;
by which I mean that only the most trifling words or
repetitions of phrases may here and there have been lost.
(3) Far from assuming that "the trance in each case [i.e. of
Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Thompson] is of the same type and
the differences are in the contents of what is said and
recorded," I assume, if not the precise contrary, at least
something not far removed from it. (v. p. 105.)
(4) I entirely dissent from Professor Hyslop's opinion that a
full verbatim report of " nonsense " is either essential or
desirable. In my view a selection of nonsense suffices.
Where evidence of supernormal faculty is sought, I, of
course, agree that a verbatim record and report is essential.
(5) Professor Hyslop has credited me with an "act of peni
tence " of which I am not guilty—I mean, which I have
not performed.
(6) I am probably quite as much interested in, and quite as
sensible of the value of, the " nonsense " in trance-utterances
as Professor Hyslop ; but before seeking to extract psycho
logical lessons from the nonsense, I prefer first to satisfy
myself that the trance-phenomena are not spurious. I
agree with Professor Hyslop in disbelieving that "we shall
ever get at the foundations of this problem " unless the
nonsense as well as the sense receives careful study. But
I was not trying to "get at the foundations of this problem."
Perhaps 500 or 5000 years hence the time may be ripe
for making an effort to get at these foundations.

HYPNOTISM :
ITS HISTORY, PRACTICE, AND THEORY.
BY J. MILNE BRAMWELL, M.B., C.M.
8ix>. 478 pages. 18s. net.
The chief aim of this monograph is to draw the attention of medical men
to the therapeutic value of Hypnotism. The author gives the results of
twelve years of his own practice and research, with personal observations
of the work done in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and
Belgium.
The historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively
little known work of the English pioneers, Elliotsou, Esdaile, and Braid,
while the final chapter of references contains much information which has
not hitherto been published in accessible form.
The methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and
instructions given in regard to the management of the hypnotic state, with
details as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis. Hypnotic theories are
described and discussed, and special prominence is given to Mr. Myers's
theory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the
problems of hypnotism.

PRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND

THE eighth of the series of Private Meetings for Members and

London, W., on Friday, June 24th, at 8.30 p.m.; Mr. F.
Podmore in the chair.
MR. ERNEST DUXBAR read a paper on " The Light thrown on
Psychological Processes by the Action of Drugs." He pointed
out the necessity for conducting experiments of this kind with
the utmost care. A knowledge of the conditions at the com
mencement of the experiment was essential, and a careful
analysis of the stages of the experiment was equally necessary.
The problem is to find out whether the changes in con
sciousness are radical and complete, or whether there is not
some element of an unchangeable nature to be found both in
the normal and in the abnormal condition. The simplest effect
of all substances of this kind is the feeling that there is some
difference between the relationship the individual then bears to
his environment and his normal relationship to it.
Under alcohol, for instance, the individual is perfectly con
scious of this difference. There is undoubtedly a depression of
sensation commencing with touch sensations, then affecting
hearing, then smell and taste, and, lastly, sight.
The first change is found in a slight loss of appreciation of
the significance of these sensations ; finally there is a depression
of the senses themselves. The curious fact that keeps em
phasising itself in all experiments of a similar nature is that,
up to the time the individual loses all touch with his environ
ment, the intelligence appears to grasp the meaning of the situa
tion so well that, in the early stages at least, every effort is made
to gain control again. An experiment with ether was instanced
to show that, even after effects of a profound nature had been
264 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1004.
induced, the individual was still sufficiently sensible to reason
logically, and to grasp the entire significance of the situation.
It was pointed out that the changes in the feelings of the
person taking these substances had a physical parallel, and that
there were many physiological facts to indicate that in some
respects the psychical condition was closely connected with
physical changes in the cerebrum.
An exception to this was, however, indicated by the
apparent supremacy of the intelligence, which persists up to
a very extreme stage of narcotisation. Another significant
fact was that even after a long anaesthesia, in which profound
physical changes must have been produced, the patient could
take up the thread of his intelligence just where he had left
off, and when the effects of the anaesthetic had passed
off, the integrity of the intelligence remained unaltered.
The effects of Indian hemp were next referred to, and a
description by Dr. Marshall, of Cambridge, was quoted in full
from Clifford Allbutt's System of Medicine. Mr. Dunbar
referred to his own experience with this drug, which
corresponded more or less exactly with that of Dr. Marshall.
The alteration of the time-sense was the most prominent
feature of Cannabis Indica intoxication, due apparently to a
temporary paresis of memory.
The loss of the sense of personal identity was quoted as
another striking symptom in this condition, and could be
logically explained in the same way as the other effect.
Even the tendency towards unmeaning laughter might be
similarly explained, for, as Sully points out in his Psychology,
the appreciation of the humorous lies in a wilful neglect of
some part of the mental picture,—an apparent contradiction,
arising from the fact that the individual refuses to exercise
his memory to grasp the entire situation. Under Indian
hemp this memory-paresis is inevitable, and hence, for a time
at least, all things appear ludicrous and ridiculous.
Mr. Dunbar went on to describe the effects of ether, and
pointed out that Sir William Ramsay's experience, an account
of which had been read before the Society ten years ago,1
was similar to that of several who had tried the drug. The
action up to a certain stage closely resembled that of alcohol.
1 See Proceedings S.P.R. Vol. IX., p. 236.
JCT.Y, 1904. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 265
After the first effects of ether have passed off1, there cornea a
time of profound intellectual stimulation, during which the mind
reasons with an astonishing rapidity, choosing, in some individuals,
transcendental lines, and, as the intoxication progresses, appearing
to solve, once and for all, the mystery of the universe.
As against this experience, chloroform produces in many
individuals a very different effect, there being far less stimulation
and a much more rapid subsequent depression.
Substances resembling chloroform in this respect are—
Benzene, ethyl bromide, ethyl iodide, carbon bisulphide, carbon
tetrachloride, and amylene. A noteworthy fact in connection
with these substances is that, without exception, they are all
excellent solvents of fat, and considering the prevalence of fat
and such like substances in the nervous system, there might
conceivably be a connection between this chemical action and
their effect on the nervous system.
In closing, Mr. Dunbar pointed out how exceedingly difficult
it was to draw conclusions from experiments with drugs. The
majority of people had a healthy repugnance to dosing themselves
with substances of this kind, even for scientific purposes, but he
thought that a careful and systematic study of the effects of drugs
on different individuals should of necessity yield positive results.
THE CHAIRMAN remarked that the paper would, he thought,
have been welcomed by Mr. Myers, since the view taken
by Mr. Dunbar in regard to the unimpaired state of the in
dividual's intelligence under experiments of this nature was an
interesting illustration of some of Mr. Myers's own theories.
The intellect of the patient, according to Mr. Dunbar's view,
remained unaffected, looking on, as it were, at the conflict
of the senses. This theory was apparently borne out by the
fact that the more intelligent the person experimented upon,
the more difficult it seemed to bring him under the influence
of the drug. He quoted as a possible instance the story
told in the Symposium, of how at a certain feast Socrates
alone remained unaffected, after all the other guests had
succumbed to the effects of the wine they had drunk, and
continued all night discoursing of philosophy. He thought we
should, however, be cautious in our interpretation of the
effects seemingly produced by drugs. There was always
the possibility of these effects being due to expectancy, though
266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, UKM.
Mr. Dunbar's own experiences were not apparently open to
this objection, as he had not read beforehand the accounts
with which his personal experiments coincided. It was also
possible that the results might depend partly on the tempera
ment of the experimenter. For example, when reading some
years ago an account given by Herbert Spencer of his experi
ences under chloroform, Mr. Podmore had remarked that the
effects apparently produced by the drug were in accordance
with Spencer's own philosophical theories. Sir W. Eamsay's
and Sir H. Davy's accounts both coincided with Mr. Ihmbar's,
but in a number of experiments made by Sir H. Davy on
twenty other persons, the anaesthetic had produced merely
pleasurable sensations, with a marked inclination to laughter.
MR. J. G. PIDDINGTON read an account of Oliver Wendell
Holmes' sensations whilst under the influence of ether, which
in some respects coincided with Sir H. Davy's. It was not
stated, however, whether Dr. Holmes had read the latter's
account beforehand.
.Referring to the sense of precognition sometimes experienced
by persons under the influence of anaesthetics, Mr. Piddingtou
observed that he had himself once had this feeling after
taking chloroform and ether, and on hearing, during the process
of awakening, a remark made by the doctor, had said to him
two or three times, in an excited and insistent manner, that he
had known beforehand exactly what he, the doctor, had been going
to say. He thought, however, that it was not at all necessary
to assume a real precognitive faculty in order to explain this
phenomenon, as it might have been only a disturbance—pro
duced by the drug—of the perception of time-relation which made
him think that his impression had preceded the doctor's remark,
whereas it had probably followed it.
Sm LAWRENCE JONES, referring to a case published in the
Proceedings (Vol. VIII., p. 194) of apparent clairvoyance during
a state of unconsciousness from exhaustion, inquired if any cases
of a similar nature had been observed in persons under the
influence of chloroform, etc.
MR. Fox PITT stated that in his experience the effects of
benzene were not similar to those produced by chloroform or
ether. There was a certain fascination in inhaling benzene,
and it seemed somehow to intensify the sense of existence,
JULI, 1904. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 267
but the actual effects upon himself had been exceedingly un
pleasant. All kinds of difficulties, worries, and unpleasantness
had seemed to be crowded together in his mind, and all power
of overcoming or avoiding them seemed to be removed. Ether
and chloroform, on the other hand, tended rather to give the
impression of solving such difficulties.
DR. KINGSTON, in relating his own experiences, said that he
had found the loss of time sensation very marked—e.g. he had
found himself wondering whether certain events had taken place
a clay ago or only a few minutes before. He had also had
a curious feeling of expansion, as though he had been blown
out into something like a balloon, with all his sensations diffused
through it, except for a few lines of thrilling vitality, which had
given him the impression of having several souls. When he felt
himself becoming unconscious he had made efforts to keep awake,
which produced the sensation of hauling himself up from some
immense depth, with a great shock every time he came to
the surface. Each time he went down again he seemed to sink
deeper, until when the effort to rise became too great, he let
himself go, and thereupon lost consciousness.
MR. PIDDINGTON suggested that the possible effects produced
by expectancy might be tested in the case of benzene by
assuring the patient to whom it was to be administered
that he would find its effects exceedingly pleasant—that being
precisely the contrary of what Mr. Fox Pitt and Mr. Dunbar had
found to be the case with this drug.
MR. DUNBAR, replying to questions raised by these speakers,
said he fully agreed with Mr. Podmore that the effects produced
by many of these drugs would in all probability vary with
the temperament of the individual, but that in those cases
in which a drug produced the same effect on many indi
viduals, the personal equation could perhaps be neglected.
With regard to Herbert Spencer's statement that under
chloroform he experienced a depression of the higher faculties
in order, the highest going first and the lowest last, Mr.
Dunbar thought this experience largely imaginary. If it was
a fact, then it was a contradiction in terms, for what would
the faculty which appreciated the entire process be ? The
faculty which could follow the changes in mentation must
surely be the highest process of mentation.
2G8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JCLT, 1904.
In reply to Sir Lawrence Jones, Mr. Dunbar spoke of the
great difficulty of obtaining reliable instances of clairvoyance in
this connection ; he said it was a fairly common thing for patients
to state that they were conscious of the steps of an operation,
but that never within his experience had there been anything
approaching to accuracy in their accounts. It did not, how
ever, seem improbable that clairvoyance could occur in these
conditions, because once the consciousness of the individual
is detached from his environment, we have a state full of
strange possibilities. Mr. Dunbar agreed with Mr. Fox Pitt
in his statement that benzene produced sensations of an
eminently disagreeable nature, but said he had not mentioned
it, as he had not observed the effect in any one else.
The sole value of these experiences lay in their univer
sality, and only in so far as an experience was general could
it be regarded as bearing on general psychological laws.
G. F. WATTS, K.A.
(HONORARY MEMBER or THE S.P.R.)
[The following lines were written by Mr. Myers shortly
after visiting Mr. Watts some years ago, and may now not
inaptly be cited in memory of our late Honorary Member.—
EDITOR.]
If it be true that there is a spiritual world, wherein, even
while still on earth, we veritably are living; if it be true that
with man's growing knowledge his conviction of that unseen
environment must for ever deepen;—then types of character must
needs arise responsive to that great revelation ; there must be
saints of a universal religion, who without thought of sect or
dogma shall answer to the welcoming Infinite with simplicity
and calm. No man, perhaps, has fulfilled this type more per
fectly than the great painter who must soon, from a life's work
on earth which none of his generation has equalled, pass to
continue with all readiness his task elsewhere.
When last I saw Mr. Watts, in great old age, among the
symbolic pictures of his later years, he seemed to me to have
become himself a sacred symbol ; and I should scarcely have
wondered, as I gazed on him, if he had vanished into air. His
JULT, 1904. G. F. Watts, R.A. 269
look, his words were simple ; he stood as it were unconcernedly
in both worlds, the one as present to him as the other.
"Naturally I have cared to work at these ideas; I have never
cajed very much for anything else .... I felt that this was
so; and I have all my life tried to express it."
It has fallen to me to speak with one other man .only
who seemed to me as close to things divine. The mighty
mind of Tennyson " heaved with the heaving deep " ; to the
childlike intuition of Watts the great secret was, as the
French phrase goes, simple commc bonjonr. For such a man
what we call death is reduced to a mere formality ; and by
an opening of inner vision the immanent becomes the manifest
heaven. F. W. H. M.
CASE.
L. 1138. Simultaneous Dreams.
THE following case of dream impressions coinciding with a
fatal accident that occurred to the brother of the dreamers
was sent to us by the kindness of Miss K. Raleigh, of
Beechwood, Loudwater, Bucks, a lady well known to the
Editor.
The accounts were enclosed in a letter from Miss Ealeigh,
dated April 28th, 1904, and were, she says, written by the
witnesses independently of each other. They gave their full
names and addresses, but wished initials only to be printed.
Miss M. L. B. wrote as follows :
In compliance to the request of Miss K. Raleigh I have written
thus.
On the evening of November 18th, 1903, I, M. L. B., retired
about half-past nine o'clock and fell asleep. I had a most peculiar
vision or dream. I thought I was walking through streets in a
strange place ; it was artificially lighted ; there were a number of
people walking to and fro on either side of the streets. I heard
a peculiar noise, and turned partly round to see what was the
cause of it. A vehicle was coming rushing across the top of the
street ; I was a few paces down ; it looked something like a train,
but not a train, it was running on metals ; something was coming
down where I had crossed ; there was an awful crash as if my (so-
called) train had run upon something, and in a moment something
heavy fell with a sickening thud on the pavement, at my feet.
270 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JCLT, 1904.
I tried to cry out, but could not. In a moment a crowd had
collected, and several people picked up the body which had fallen
at my feet. I could see it was a man. I could not see the face,
only a large gash on the back of the head, and near the lips, from which
the blood was flowing. As the drops fell they splashed into a
puddle of blood on the ground and sprinkled on to me. Some one
said, " Take him away." I tried to cry out, " What shall I do 1 " and
awoke trembling and perspiring, and crying bitterly.
I could not think where I was, [but] found I was in bed, and had
been dreaming, as I supposed. I lay quite still for fear of disturbing
my sister. In a short time my sister lit a match and looked at
her watch, and said, " It is past eleven o'clock." I did not tell her of
my dream, as I did not wish her to worry. I thought it strange
for her to get a light and tell me the time. I was fearfully
worried for some days.
On the Monday morning following, I had another dream. I
dreamed my brother, H. B., (I had not seen since the previous
January, or even heard from him) was lying ill in a strange room,
and a man was putting him in an ambulance. I thought he said,
"Take my sister away, I am not fit to be where she is." He
looked so strange, I awoke again in great agitation.
On the same evening a young friend, Miss P., came to call, and
my sister left us alone. After she had gone I said, "R., have you
heard if my nephew, or any one belonging to me, has met
with an accident, and they will not tell me, as I have had such
strange dreams and feel I don't know what to do with myself.
I feel haunted. I have not felt like this since just before Mother
dierl." I told my dreams and cried very much. She said, "Don't
fret," and assured me she had heard nothing concerning any one
belonging to me. I still felt miserable.
On the 26th of November we received the news that our brother,
H., was lying ill in F Infirmary, in a precarious condition; on
the 27th we received the news that he was dead, died the previous
day after the letter was posted to us. On the paper enclosed you
will find all the main information we received regarding our brother's
accident and death. If you compare the dates you will find the
accident happened at the time I was dreaming about it. I had
better state here I have never seen an electric tramcar. What I
have written here is perfectly true.
I have not seen my brother either living or dead since a year
last January, as I was much too ill to go to his funeral.
JOLT, 1904. Case. 271
The other sister, Miss H. M. B., wrote :
November 18th, 1903, I went to bed at 10 p.m. and was going to sleep
when a loud crashing sound roused me, and the voice of my brother
followed saying, " Oh Duck, I am done for." I covered my eyes
and said, "Oh H., is it your face that is hurt?" He said "No."
The horror of it was extremely depressing. It was about 11.15 and
I could get no sleep through the night, it worried me so. I had
not seen my brother since the previous January, and he had not
written to me since. Duck was his pet name for me.
Miss P., the friend referred to in the first account, wrote :
On the 23rd of November, 1903, I, R. P., went to to see
my friend Miss M. B. On the 23rd of November my friend told
me of her distressing dream that she had dreamed on the 18th of
November, 1903; it seemed as if she could not forget it, she said
that it seemed to worry her so. The time that my friend told
me about her dream was between the hours of seven and eight
o'clock in the evening, and my friend said it was some one had
met with an accident, and the face was hurt, but [she] could not see
who it was, and my friend said that it looked like a train, and
yet not so, as it had no engine on, and my friend has never seen
an electric car at all, and she could not forget her dream ; and then
on the 26th of November my friend had news about her brother's
accident. R. P.
Miss H. M. B. wrote later :
I did not mention my dream to any one until after my brother's
accident. ... He died on November 26th, 1903, and then my
sister told me about her dream, and I said, how very strange [it
was] we should each have such a strange experience and at the
same time ; I then told her all about it.
It thus happens that no further corroboration was obtainable
of Miss H. M. B.'s experience ; but the statement in her sister's
account that she lit a match, looked at her watch, and told
her what time it was, affords some indirect evidence in con
firmation of her own.
The following paragraph describing the accident is taken
from Lloytfs Weekly News, of November 29th, 1903.
ELECTRIC TRAMCAR FATALITY.
At F. yesterday Mr. D held an inquiry on H. B., 47, a horse
dealer, of . Mr. H. W. T , an official at the Bank of
272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1904.
England, living at , stated that at a quarter to eleven on the
night of Wednesday week [November 18th] he was on an electric
tramcar going westward. They had just restarted from the Pack
Horse when the deceased drove out of the Devonshire Road into
the High Road right across the track of the car. He did not appear
to see the car. The car was pulled up at once, but it caught the
trap and overturned it, and deceased was thrown out and struck
his head on the kerb. It was an unavoidable accident. It appeared
that the deceased was surgically attended at the Hospital, and
then removed home. On Monday [November 23rd] he was admitted
to the infirmary, where he died from the effects of concussion and
laceration of the brain and fracture of the skull. The jury returned
a verdict of "Accidental death."
Miss Raleigh writes :
[May 3rd, 1904.]
To the best of my belief Miss H. M. B. and Miss M. B.
are truthful, accurate, and careful in their statements. I have
always found them so, and they have worked for me for about
two years. They related their dreams to me about a fortnight
after the death of their brother, but in less detail than in their
written account. The main features in the written account corre
spond with what they told me.
Miss M. B. told me that she has had various similar
experiences.
KATHERINE ANN RALEIGH.
TESTS OF PERSONAL IDENTITY.
IN Mr. Myers's Human Personality, Vol. II., p. 499, a suggestion
is made that sealed letters should be deposited at the Rooms
of the Society with a view to their being kept until after the
death of the writers, when an attempt would be made to obtain
information of their contents through a medium, and so provide
some evidence of individual survival. The contents should of
course be previously unknown to any one, except the writer,
who should arrange that information of his death should be com
municated to the Society.
Since the publication of Mr. Myers's book, a number of such
letters have been received and are now stored at our Rooms.
In many cases, however, a difficulty may arise in judging when
JULT, 190-1. Test* of Personal Identity. 273
it is desirable to open the envelope, as supposing a message
purporting to come from the writer is received, it may not be
clear whether or not it is supposed to relate to the contents
of the envelope.
To obviate this difficulty, Colonel Taylor has recently suggested
a plan which we should like to recommend to persons who
are trying to obtain evidence in this way. It is that the
writer should prepare, say, three envelopes, the writing inside
each being the answer to a question written on the outside.
The answer should, of course, be thoroughly well wrapped up
inside the envelope, which should be sealed, and the question
should, obviously, be of such a kind that it would be almost
impossible to answer it by a mere guess. The question and
answer should relate to some very definite fact, known
only to the person who is hoping to communicate it after
wards, and it should be a fact of so much interest to
himself that he might reasonably be expected to remember it
afterwards, if he kept any recollection at all of his previous
life.
If there appeared to be some distinct evidence during a
sitting that the medium was being controlled by or in com
munication with the writer, one of the envelopes might be
presented and an attempt made to get a definite answer to
the question outside it. The answer should then be carefully
recorded, after which it should be handed to some responsible
person, who would then open the envelope.
CASE OF THE CURE OF WARTS
BY " CHARMING."
Cases of the cure of warts by " charming " have appeared
in the Journal from time to time ; see especially those recorded
by Mr. C. P. Coghill (Vol. VIII. p. 7, January, 1897, and
Vol. IX. p. 100, July 1899), and by Miss M. H. Mason (Vol.
VIII. p. 226, April 1898, and Vol. IX. p. 223, April
1900). The following case is unique in our records in that
the cure was apparently performed at a distance, the man who
performed it never having met the patient. This shows
that (as most probably happens in cures performed close at
hand) the effect must have been produced by suggestion and
274 Journal of Society for Psychical, Research. JULY, 19<M.
expectancy,—unless, indeed, the cure took place in the ordi
nary course of nature, the possibility of which must always
be kept in view.
We were first informed of the case by the kindness of
Mrs. Spencer Graves, who wrote to us as follows :
LITTLE MISSENDEN ABBEY, GREAT MISSENDEN,
BUCKS, 29th January, 1904.
. . . My story of the warts is this. A friend had a little girl aged
10 with both hands covered with warts and two on her lip. She was
expressing her distress at this when a mutual friend of hers and mine
said, " You will laugh at me, but an old man in our village cured one
on my hand when I was a girl by charming. He won't say what he
does, and does not require to know anything about the person except
the number of warts." The mother laughingly asked her to tell "Old
Tom," and on the child counting, there were 50. I forgot all about the
incident till about two months after, when my friend was staying with
me, and I suddenly said, " How about D 's warts 1 " She answered,
" They have nearly disappeared ; I expect when I return they will have
quite gone." On her return home she wrote me there was no sign of
one. The old man asks no payment, but is very pleased with any
present. He is well known in the country round as a doctor for horses,
is a herbalist, and a shoemaker, over 80. I have not verified all this
as to time, place, etc., but this is the main outline.
BEATRICE GRAVES.
We wrote to Mrs. Spencer Graves asking for first-hand accounts
from her friend and the mother of the child, and she replied :
LITTLE MISSENDEN ABBEY, GREAT MISSENDEN,
BUCKS, March Uth, 1904.
I regret having been so long in responding to your enquiries about
the -wart cure, but I could not get the two accounts written by the two
ladies ; they kept forgetting about it. However, now I enclose them,
and think it is a very interesting case, knowing all concerned so inti
mately. You will see the child and the old man never met nor com
municated with each other, only through others. One was in Wales,
the other [in] Norfolk. . . .
The accounts enclosed were as follows :
Harry Allen, horse clipper and vet., age over 80, has lived all his
life at Attleboro', in Norfolk. Tall, stout, clean shaven, and had a
round, merry face (very wrinkled with age now).
JULY, 190-4. Cure of Warts by Charming. 275
He was told about the wart charm when a boy of eight ; some old
man told him, and he must not tell the secret to any one else, or he
could not charm the warts away. His wife and son do not know what
he does. Some time back I had a wart on my finger, and stopped him
in the road and asked if he could cure it. He looked at the place, and
simply said, " Only one, lady ? that'll be all right, that will go," and in
a short time it did, and has not returned. I have heard about many
children he has cured in the village. In the case of the little girl with
the 50 on one hand, 15 on the other, and one on lip, he did not see
her. I first asked him if he could do anything in it. He said,
" You get the lady just to write the number down on a slip of paper."
I think I told him the child lived in Wales, and a girl. I took
him the letter, and tore out the piece for him with the number; he
asked me to give it him so as not to forget. He seemed very much
astonished at the number he had to deal with, and said, " I must
get to work at once." He did not say how long it would take for
the charm to work—"may be a fortnight or more, as it's a big
lot."
The old mau is quite a well-known character in the place, and
has been very clever with horses ; believes in old-fashioned remedies,
I think. . . IDA K. SALTEH.
BROOMFIELD HALL, MOLD,
FLINTSHIRE, March 12th, 1904.
I have been asked to send you an account of how my daughter's
warts were cured.
When she was about seven a very large one came on one hand
and two smaller ones on the other, and remained for about two
years, when the large one came off—the result, we thought, of her
constant playing in sea water. When she was nine we noticed
they were increasing, and they became most unsightly, particularly
on one hand. We tried many remedies, with no result whatever.
The strong acids applied by a doctor appeared rather to increase
them, and I then heard through a friend of an old man in Norfolk
who could charm them. He merely asked for the numbers, which
I sent. Fifty on one hand, seventeen on the other, were, I think,
the numbers, and one on her face below her lips. I was away from
home at the time, and her governess counted them, and I wrote
to my friend giving the number. There was no result for a fort
night, and then some of them become rather painful, and they
constantly bled, without apparently any reason. These symptoms
276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1904.
continued for about a fortnight or three weeks, when we noticed
they were getting smaller, and very gradually they disappeared
until they had absolutely gone, leaving no scar at all. It was
about two months or a little longer before they all disappeared,
and there has been no return up to now, nearly a year after. I
don't think the child thought very much about it, though she
knew that the man was trying to cure her, and, childlike, felt no
difficulty in believing he could. Of course, while they were painful
she must have thought of them, otherwise they didn't seem to
trouble her at all, as she never seemed to realise the unsightliness
of them, so that there seemed no conscious effort on the child's
part to corroborate the old man's efforts, for the success of which I
am utterly at a loss to account.
CONSTANCE SUMMERS.
We then wrote to enquire whether the large wart that
appeared at the age of seven was the only one that had
gone away of itself, or whether any of the others Lad simi
larly come off; also when the "cure" had begun, and when
the last wart had disappeared. Mrs. Summers replied as
follows :
April Glh, [1904].
... I am afraid I cannot give you the exact date myself, but
I think the old man was told of them early in May, and they had
all gone by the end of July. Dorothy at the time was just ten
years old. The smaller warts she had when she was seven had
never gone, and the only one that ever went was the one large one on
a finger, which came off whole one day, while the others gradually
disappeared. I only mentioned that one, because the way in which
it went was so different. We attributed it to the action of the
sea-water, whether rightly or not I cannot say.

BY J. MILNE BRAMWELL, M.B., C.M.
8»o. 4~8payes. 1&*. net.
The chief aim of this monograph is to draw the attention of medical men
to the therapeutic value of Hypnotism. The author gives the results of
twelve years of his own practice and research, with personal observations
of the work done in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and
Belgium.
The historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively
little known work of the English pioneers, Elliotaon, Esdaile, and Braid,
while the final chapter of references contains much information which has
not hitherto been published in accessible form.
The methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and
instructions given in regard to the management of the hypnotic state, with
details as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis. Hypnotic theories are
described and discussed, and special prominence is given to Mr. Myers's
theory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the
problems of hypnotism.

CASE.
L. 1139 Dream.
THE following case of apparent telepathy from an animal
was first published in The Times for July 21st, 1904, from
which we quote Mr. Eider Haggard's account of it :
DITCHINGHA&I, July Kith.
Perhaps you will think with me that the following circumstances
are worthy of record, if only for their scientific interest. It is
principally because of this interest that, as such stories should 'not
be told anonymously, after some hesitation I have made up my
mind to publish them over my own name, although I am well aware
that by so doing I may expose myself to a certain amount of ridi
cule and disbelief.
On the night of Saturday, July 9, I went to bed about 12.30,
and suffered from what I took to be a nightmare. I was awakened
by my wife's voice calling to me from her own bed upon the other
aide of the room. As I awoke, the nightmare itself, which had been
long and vivid, faded from my brain. All I could remember of it
was a sense of awful oppression and of desperate and terrified
struggling for life such as the act of drowning would probably
involve. But between the time that I heard my wife's voice and the
time that my consciousness answered to it, or so it seemed to me, I
had another dream. I dreamed that a black retriever dog, a most
amiable and intelligent beast named Bob, which was the property
of my eldest daughter, was lying on its side among brushwood, or
rough growth of some sort, by water. My own personality in some
mysterious way seemed to me to be arising from the body of the
dog, which I knew quite surely to be Bob and no other, so much
so that my head was against its head, which was lifted up at an
unnatural angle. In my vision the dog was trying to speak to me
in words, and, failing, transmitted to my mind in an undefined
fashion the knowledge that it was dying. Then everything vanished,
and I woke to hear my wife asking me why on earth I was making
those horrible and weird noises. I replied that I had had a night
mare about a fearful struggle, and that I had dreamed that old Bob
was in a dreadful way, and was trying to talk to me and to tell
me about it. Finally, seeing that it was still quite dark, I asked
what the time was. She said she did not know, and shortly after
wards I went to sleep again and was disturbed no more.
On the Sunday morning Mrs. Rider Haggard told the tale at
OCT., 1904. Case. 279
breakfast, and I repeated my story in a few words. This I need
not do here, as the annexed statements set out what occurred quite
clearly.
Thinking that the whole thing was nothing more than a disagree
able dream, I made no enquiries about the dog and never learned
even that it was missing until that Sunday night, when my little
girl, who was in the habit of feeding it, told me so. At breakfast
time, I may add, nobody knew that it was gone, as it had been seen
late on the previous evening. Then I remembered my dream, and
the following day enquiries were set on foot.
To be brief, on the morning of Thursday, the 14th, my servant,
Charles Bedingfield, and I discovered the body of the dog floating
in the Waveney against a weir about a mile and a quarter away.
The two certificates of the veterinary surgeon, Mr. Mullane, are
enclosed herewith. They sufficiently describe its condition.
On Friday, the 15th, I was going into Bungay to offer a reward
for the discovery of the persons who were supposed to have destroyed
the dog in the fashion suggested in Mr. Mullane's first certificate,
when at the level crossing on the Bungay road I was hailed by two
platelayers, who are named respectively George Arterton and Harry
Alger. These men informed me that the dog had been killed by a
train, and took me on a trolly down to a certain open-work bridge
which crosses the water between Ditchingham and Bungay, where
they showed me evidences of its death. This is the sum of their
evidence :
It appears that about 7 o'clock upon the Monday morning, very
shortly after the first train had passed, in the course of his duties
Harry Alger was on the bridge, where he found a dog's collar torn
off and broken by the engine (since produced and positively identi
fied as that worn by Bob), coagulated blood, and bits of flesh, of
which remnants he cleaned the rails. On search also I personally
found portions of black hair from the coat of a dog. On the Monday
afternoon and subsequently his mate saw the body of the dog floating
in the water beneath the bridge, whence it drifted down to the
weir, it having risen with the natural expansion of gases, such as, in
this hot weather, might be expected to occur within about 40 hours
of death. It would seem that the animal must have been killed
by an excursion train that left Ditchingham at 10.25 on Saturday
night, returning empty from Harleston a little after 11. This was
the last train which ran that night. No trains run on Sunday, and
it is practically certain that it cannot have been killed on the
280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1904.
Monday morning, for then the blood would have been still fluid.
Also men who were working around when the 6.30 train passed
must have seen the dog on the line (they were questioned by Alger
at the time and had seen nothing), and the engine-driver in broad
daylight would also have witnessed and made a report of the accident,
of which in a dark night he would probably know nothing. Further,
if it was living, the dog would almost certainly have come home
during Sunday, and its body would not have risen so quickly from
the bottom of the river, or presented the appearance it did on
Thursday morning. From traces left upon the piers of the bridge
it appears that the animal was knocked or carried along some yards
by the train and fell into the brink of the water where reeds grow.
Here, if it were still living,—and, although the veterinary thinks
that death was practically instantaneous, its life may perhaps have
lingered for a few minutes,—it must have suffocated and sunk,
undergoing, I imagine, much the same sensations as I did in my
dream, and in very similar surroundings to those that I saw therein
—namely, amongst a scrubby growth at the edge of water.
Both in a judicial and a private capacity I have been accustomed
all my life to the investigation of evidence, and, if we may put
aside our familiar friend "the long arm of coincidence," which in
this case would surely be strained to dislocation, I confess that that
available upon this matter forces me to the following conclusions :
The dog Bob, between whom and myself there existed a mutual
attachment, either at the moment of his death, if his existence can
conceivably have been prolonged till after 1 in the morning, or, as
seems more probable, about three hours after that event, did succeed
in calling my attention to its actual or recent plight by placing
whatever portion of my being is capable of receiving such impulses
when enchained by sleep, into its own terrible position. That sub
sequently, as that chain of sleep was being broken by the voice of
my wife calling me back to a normal condition of our human ex
istence, with some last desparing effort, while that indefinable part
of me was being slowly withdrawn from it (it will be remembered
that in my dream I seemed to rise from the dog), it spoke to me,
first trying to make use of my own tongue, and, failing therein, by
some subtle means of communication whereof I have no knowledge
telling me that it was dying, for I saw no blood or wounds which
would suggest this to my mind.
I recognise, further, that, if its dissolution took place at the
moment when I dreamt, this communication must have been a
OCT., 1904. Case. 281
form of that telepathy which is now very generally acknowledged
to occur between human beings from time to time and under
special circumstances, but which I have never heard of as occurring
between a human being and one of the lower animals. If, on the
other hand, that dissolution happened, as I believe, over three hours
previously—what am I to say ? Then it would seem that it must
have been some non-bodily but surviving part of the life or of the
spirit of the dog which, so soon as my deep sleep gave it an
opportunity, reproduced those things in my mind, as they had
*lready occurred, I presume, to advise me of the manner of its end
or to bid me farewell.
There is a third possibility which I will quote, although the
«vidence seems to me to be overwhelmingly against it, and, for the
reasons already given, it is inherently most improbable—namely,
that the dog was really killed about half-past 6 on the Monday
morning, in which case my dream was nothing but a shadow of its
forthcoming fate.
Personally, however, I do not for a moment believe this to have
been the case, especially as the veterinary's certificate states that
the animal's body must have been " over three days " in the water
at the time of its discovery.
On the remarkable issues opened up by this occurrence I cannot
venture to speak further than to say that,—although it is dangerous
to generalise from a particular instance, however striking and well
supported by evidence, which is so rarely obtainable in such
obscure cases,—it does seem to suggest that there is a more intimate
ghostly connection between all members of the animal world,
including man, than has hitherto been believed, at any rate by
Western peoples ; that they may be, in short, all of them different
manifestations of some central, informing life, though inhabiting the
universe in such various shapes. The matter, however, is one for
the consideration of learned people who have made a study of these
mysterious questions. I will only add that I ask you to publish
the annexed documents with this letter, as they constitute the
written testimony at present available to the accuracy of what I state.
Further, I may say that I shall welcome any investigation by
competent persons.
H. RIDER HAGGARD.
The veterinary surgeon who examined the body of the dog
wrote to Mr. Rider Haggard as follows :
282 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1904.
BUNGAY, July 14th, 1904.
DEAR SIR,—In pursuance of your instructions I have inspected
the dog found in the water at the Falcon Bridge, Bungay.
It was in a very decomposed and tympanitic condition.
In answer to your inquiries,
(1) I believe it is your dog Bob, which I have frequently
attended and which was at my house for one week under treatment.
(2) Cause of death.
Fracture of skull in three places, the skull being smashed almost
to a pulp by some heavy, blunt instrument. The wounds are not
caused by gun shot.
(3) The body must have been in the water over three days, and
very probably the dog was killed on the night of July 9th (Satur
day), after which it was missing.
Both forelegs were fractured just below the knees. I should say
this was done by a large trap, probably an otter trap, as the
injuries are too severe and high up the legs to be caused by a
rabbit trap. It seems probable that the dog went to the water to
drink and stood upon the table of the trap, his body being after-
wards thrown into the river. P. J. MULLANE, M.R.C.V.S.
Mr. Mullane wrote later :—
BUNGAY, .My 15th, 1904.
To H. Rider Haggard, Esq.,—Having heard the story of the
destruction of the dog "Bob" by a train on Saturday night, I am
of opinion that his injuries are compatible with that method of
death. The guard of the engine might have shattered his head
and the wheels of the engine severed the bones of the fore legs.
P. J. MULLANK, M.R.C.V.S.
Mrs. Haggard wrote :—
DITCHINGHAM HOUSE, BUNGAY, July 15th, 1904.
On the night [of] July 9th I was awakened by most distressing
sounds proceeding from my husband, resembling the moans of an
animal, no distinct words. After listening for a few moments, I
woke him up, whereupon he said that he had had a nightmare, in
which he was engaged in some struggle connected with our retriever
dog "Bob," and that "Bob" was trying to talk to him and
explain that he wanted help. It was quite dark at the time, so I
conclude it must have been about 2 a.m.
M. L. HAGGARD.
OCT., 19W. Case. 283
Miss Haggard wrote :—
July 14th, 1904.
On Sunday morning, July 10th, my father mentioned at the
breakfast table that he had had a horrid nightmare about my black
retriever dog "Bob."
He said that he dreamt the dog was dying in a wood and
trying to make some communication to him. My mother corro
borated this statement, saying he had made such a noise that he
had even awakened her, and she aroused him as he seemed so
disturbed.
Of course we all laughed at it at the time, for we did not know
then that anything had happened to the dog, for I had seen him
myself at 8 o'clock on the preceding evening.
ANGELA KIDER HAGGARD.
Miss L. E. Haggard wrote :—
July 14th, 1904.
On the evening of Sunday, July 10th, I, who am in the habit
of feeding the dogs, told Daddy that " Bob " had not come to his
breakfast or his supper that day, so I thought he must be lost.
Daddy had said at breakfast on Sunday that he had dreamt
that " Bob " was dying in a wood, and that he, Daddy, was trying
to extract something from " Bob," and that "Bob " was trying to
speak. LILIAS R. HAGGARD.
A lady relative who lives at Ditchingham House wrote :—
July 14th, 1904.
On Sunday morning at breakfast Louie [Mrs. Eider Haggard]
said "Rider" [Mr. Eider Haggard] "had a nightmare last night,
and made such noises that he woke me up, and I had to wake him."
When Eider came down we talked about his nightmare, and he
said with a laugh, "Yes, it was old 'Bob,' he was being killed,
and he was calling out to me to save him." L. E. HILDYARD.
Mr. Haggard's secretary wrote :—
DITCHINGHAM HOUSE, July 15th, 1904.
At breakfast on Sunday, the 10th, Mrs. Haggard laughingly com
plained of having been disturbed in the night by the noise Mr.
Haggard made in his sleep, so much so that she had been obliged
to wake him up. Mr. Haggard explained that he had had a night
mare, in which he had been struggling violently, and also dreamt
that he had been trying to understand something that the dog
"Bob," who was dying, was saying to him. IDA HECTOR.

The above letters were published in The Times with Mr.
Eider Haggard's account. In reply to our request to be
allowed to see the original documents, Mr. Haggard kindly lent
them to us for comparison with the printed copies and also
sent us the originals of three other statements relating to the
case, which we print here.
(1) From Mr. Mullane.
BTJNGAY, July 15th, 1904.
To H. RIDER HAGGARD, ESQ.
DEAR SIR,—It is my opinion, from the condition of the dog's
head, that he was killed instantaneously by a very violent blow over
the skull. P. J. MULLANK.
(2) from H. Alger.
I was at my business on the line between Bungay and Ditching-
ham at 7 o'clock on the morning of Monday, the llth July, when
only one train had passed about 6.30, and found the broken collar
of a dog lying there, which I produce, and had to scrape off the
dried blood and some bits of flesh from the line. I asked several
people who were working about and were there when the 6.30 train
passed, including Mr. Runnicles and Mr. Riches, if they had seen
a dog on the bridge, as one had been killed there. They said that
they had not.
If the engine-driver had seen a dog run over, he would have
reported it. Under all the circumstances, I think that the dog must
have been killed by the late excursion train on Saturday night
which left Ditchingham for Harleston at 10.25. From the way in
which the flesh was carried, it was evidently killed by a train going
towards Bungay.1
The marks of blood upon the piles showed where the dog had
fallen from the bridge into the reeds. These reeds grow in deepish
water.
I did not myself see the dog in the water; my mate, Arterton,
saw the body of the dog after it had risen to the surface.
It was I who cut the collar as you see it now. I did so that
it might be sewn together and used again for some other dog.

(3) From C. Bedingfield.
DITCHINGHAM, My 14M, 1904.
My master and I found the dog in the Waveney near the Falcon
Bridge on the morning of July 14th. It is the retriever dog, Bob,
•which I have known ever since it has been at Ditchingham House.
[Signed] C. BEDINGFIELD,
(Groom at Ditchingham House).
In reply to further questions as to the possibility of the dog
having been killed on the Monday morning instead of Saturday
night, Mr. Haggard wrote to us :
DITCHINGHAM HOUSE, NORFOLK,
July 23rd, 1904.
I believe that I am right in saying that if the dog had been killed
on the Monday morning, it certainly would not have floated by the
Monday midday or afternoon when it was seen by Arterton.
No, I think the water is too deep for the body to have been seen
lying at the bottom and been mistaken for a floating dog. Further,
Harry Alger, when he found the traces of the accident, looked in
the water on the Monday morning and could find no dog. It must
therefore have risen to the surface between the Monday morning
and Monday afternoon, as I believe it would naturally do, had it
met its end on the Saturday night. In short, I am absolutely con
vinced that when I had my dream the dog had been dead for at
least three hours. Further, this appears to be evident : the injuries
to the dog's head were such that death must have been instantaneous ;
and even though life lingered in the tissues, as a doctor to whom I
was talking this morning told me it might do for a little while,
from the moment that engine struck the dog's head, it must have
been utterly incapable of thought or volition as we understand it—
that is, its brain was destroyed; it was physically dead. It seems
to result therefore that in order to produce the long subsequent
impressions upon myself, it must have been spiritually aliee. In
short, even supposing that I received those impressions at the moment
of the death of the dog and stored them up for future use, or that
those impressions were flying about in the air like a wheeling hawk
waiting for an opportunity to settle on my head, they must still
have been emitted by the personality of an animal that was already
dead, doubly dead from fatal injury followed instantly by drowning.
I seem therefore to come to this conclusion. Either the whole
286 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1904.
thing is a mere coincidence and just means nothing more than
indigestion and a nightmare, or it was the spirit of the dog on its
passage to its own place or into another form, that moved my spirit,
thereby causing this revelation, for it seems to be nothing less. . . .
H. RIDER HAGGARD.
From an interview in The Daily Chronicle of July 22nd,
1904, to which Mr. Haggard referred us, saying that it was
" fairly accurate," we extract the following :
Bob, although he belonged to my daughter, who bought him three
years ago, was a great friend of mine, but I cannot say that my
soul was bound up in him.
He was a very intelligent animal, and generally accompanied me
in my walks about the farm, and almost invariably came to say
good morning to me. He was rather rheumatic, as he was getting
into years—seven perhaps—but that did not prevent him going after
rabbits, generally in company with Bustle, my spaniel.
Another letter from Mr. Haggard appeared in The Times of
August 9th, 1904, discussing the issues involved, and giving
further details of the probable mode and circumstances of the
dog's death, as follows :
... I am satisfied that the dog was destroyed about 10.27 on
the night of July 9th. It had, I think, been rabbit-hunting or
following some other canine attraction, and being hot and tired, lay
down upon a sleeper of the open bridge above the cool water, and
resting its head upon its paws, placed them on the rail, thus lifting
them a few inches above the ground. This was its invariable custom
when a turf edging or anything of the sort was available. Thus it
went to sleep. But whether asleep or awake, the blow which it
received from the wheel guard of the engine must, I presume, if it
did not cause instant death, at any rate have utterly destroyed its
mind-powers, unless dogs can think with some portion of their
organism other than the brain, of which in this instance the case
was utterly smashed. . . .
[As to the suggestion that the telepathic information may have
come from a human being who witnessed the death of the dog:]
My answer is that no human being would have been wandering
about on a dark night in a place so dangerous as an open timber-
work railway bridge over a river. I am convinced that the only
creature which can have seen the dog's death was another smaller
dog which may or may not have been with it at the time. . . .
OCT., 1904. Case. 287
As to the question whether he had had any other experi
ences of the kind, and in regard to some of the peculiar
psychological features of this case, Mr. Haggard writes to us
later :
... I never remember any other telepathic dream. From time
to time I have had uneasy dreads which have proved baseless, but
the only tangible mysterious event which I can recall was a fore
knowledge of future sorrow, which some months later proved itself
to be fearfully accurate.
. . . Was the nightmare or first dream the whole story of what
happened 1 I am inclined to think so from what I remember of it
and the animal noises that I made (see my wife's evidence). To
what can be attributed the hallucination that I seemed to rise from
the body of the dog ? This was one of the most curious parts of
the manifestation—like the separation of soul and body, as one
might imagine it. Another curious point was the fashion in which,
abandoning its attempt to talk (I thought because it was too slow)
as I departed from it, the dog seemed to flash the intelligence of
its dying state upon my mind. In an instant I knew all about it,
—through the intelligence, not through the senses.
This case is one of very unusual interest from several
points of view. It is, therefore, specially satisfactory to have
it so well authenticated, and Mr. Rider Haggard deserves the
gratitude of psychical researchers for having collected all the
available evidence so promptly and completely, and put it at
the disposal of the scientific world.
We have already published a few other cases of apparent tele
pathy from animals, e.g. one where a lady (Mrs. Bagot) staying
at Mentone saw her dog running across the room at about the
time when it was dying at her home in Norfolk (see Proceedings,
Vol. XIV. p. 285), and another in which a lady and her
husband were wakened by hearing her dog running about her
bedroom when it was actually in a distant part of the house,
and in danger of being accidentally strangled (see Journal,
Vol. IV. p. 289). On the assumption that these were genuine
instances of telepathy, the impulse, in both cases, might have
originated in the mind of the person in charge of the dog ;
whereas in Mr. Haggard's case, no human being seems to have
been aware of the condition of the dog.
288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1904.
On the other hand, we have had several instances of
telepathic hallucinations of animals which are clearly to be
referred to the minds of human beings, e.g. when a gentleman
sees a dog enter the room at the time that his daughter is read
ing a description of just such a dog (see Journal, Vol. VII.
p. 243). It is obvious, indeed, that telepathic hallucinations,
like dreams, may take the form of any animate or inanimate
object, as we find both in experimental cases, and in crystal
visions. Subjective hallucinations similarly may take any form,
though it appears from the Report on the Census of Hallucina
tions (see Proceedings, Vol. X. pp. 43, 127) that hallucinations
of animals are comparatively rare among persons in a normal
state of health. (For instances of these, including a collective
hallucination of a cat, see op. tit. pp. 127, 156, 305.) We
find again that veridical hallucinations of living or dying
persons occasionally include figures of animals (see, e.g. Pro
ceedings, Vol. V. p. 469 ; Journal, Vol. VI. p. 129; Phantasms
of the Living, Vol. II. p. 97). These seem to be mere
adjuncts to the central telepathic element of the vision, and
(as argued in Phantasms of the Living), are no doubt—like
the clothes in which human apparitions generally appear to be
clad—due to the working up of the percept by the action
of the percipient's own mind.
In Mr. Haggard's and Mrs. Bagot's cases, on the other
hand, the vision represented the animal alone, and if
veridical at all, referred obviously to the animal itself.
These two cases are, undoubtedly, analogous to the cases of
apparitions of dying persons, of which we have so many well-
authenticated examples ; but as long as there are so few of
the former type, they cannot be treated as of equal weight
with the latter.
Several other interpretations besides that of a mental im
pulse from the supposed animal agent are possible. It might
be supposed that the vision was not really telepathic, but
clairvoyant,—that is due simply to the supernormal powers
of the percipient. Cases are on record of distant events
having been perceived in which no one known to the percipient
was concerned, e.g. visions of accidents to trains or ships ; but
there is practically no evidence of clairvoyance of events
unknown to any one.
OCT., 1904. Caxe. 289
In this case, Mr. Haggard lays stress on the fact that, as
far as can be ascertained, no human being could have known
of the condition of his dog at the time of his dream ; and
this certainly supports the theory of telepathy from the dog.
It is noteworthy that there were many details in the vision,
besides the central fact of the dog's death, which seemed to
correspond closely to the actual events ; while Mr. Haggard's
description of his apparent absorption at the time in the
personality of the dog affords a curious parallel to the " per
sonations " and " dramatisations " of sensitives.
There is also very strong evidence that the dog had been
dead for several hours before the dream ; and Mr. Haggard argues
that, if so, the telepathic impulse probably came from its
surviving spirit. Considering, however, the enormous difficulties
in the way of proving human survival, the evidence for which
is far more abundant, this conclusion must be regarded as
extremely dubious. In Phantasms of the Living a number of
cases were published of apparitions seen a few hours after the
death of the1 person represented ; but as these seemed to form
part of a natural group including apparitions seen a few hours
before the death, and others more precisely coinciding with it,
they were all treated as cases of the same central type, the
essential feature in all being the death or approaching death
of the agent. It was argued that when the apparition was
seen shortly after the death, the telepathic impulse might well
have been transmitted at the time of death and have remained
latent in the percipient's mind until some appropriate moment
of quiescence allowed it to emerge into his supraliminal con
sciousness. We find this latency occasionally in cases of
experimental telepathy ; it often happens that some trifling
object perceived half consciously or sub-consciously in the day
re-appears prominently in a dream at night ; while in ordinary
life there is always a certain interval, varying considerably in
different cases, between the reception of a sense impression
and its development into a fully blown mental perception.-
Taking all these facts into consideration, it has always been
maintained in our Society's publications that evidence derived
from apparitions seen shortly after death is quite insufficient
to establish survival, and our readers are aware of how many
difficulties arise even in the interpretation of cases of apparent
290 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 19M,
continued mental activity or telepathy from the dead at a
considerable period after death. It must obviously be still more
difficult to obtain satisfactory evidence in the case of animals.
Again, if we admit the possibility of telepathy from animals,
this opens the door to a still larger number of possible sources
•of telepathic information. Thus there may have been several
other animals besides the little dog " Bustle " who knew of the
fate of the retriever " Bob," and we cannot exclude the
possibility of telepathy from them to Mr. Haggard.
No complete theory, in short, can be built up on any one
case, however well-established. The only way of advancing
our knowledge of the subject is for other witnesses to follow
the example of Mr. Haggard in thoroughly sifting and com
pletely recording immediately after their occurrence, all cases
•that fall within their own experience.
ME. MERRIFIELD'S SITTING WITH D. D. HOME.
IN the Journal for May, 1903, we printed an account by Mr.
Merrifield of a sitting held with D. D. Home in 1855, the
acccount having been written within a few weeks of the
sitting.
Mr. Merrifield now sends us a further note on the sitting,
•which we gladly print, since, in an enquiry of this kind, it
is desirable to spare no pains to arrive at the most accurate
representation of the facts that is possible.
24 VERNON TERRACE,
BRIGHTON, 17th July, 1904.
Home's "Spirit-hand."
My attention has been drawn to an article in the CarnhiU
.Magazine of April last,—" Historical Mysteries. IV. : The strange
•case of Daniel Dunglas Home," where Mr. Andrew Lang refers to
•the means I had of observation when I saw the " spirit-hand "
produced by Home.
This has led me to make further research as to the amount of
light available on the occasion, and I am now able to give precise
information on the subject, and in a way that any one can verify
.for himself.
OCT., 1904. Mr. Merrifidd's Sitting with D. D. Home. 291
All I could say before as to date was that what I described
happened in July, 1855. It was obvious that if I could learn
on what day in that year the moon set not far from 10 o'clock
at night, I could fix the date in July within a day or two, and
then any one could find for himself how much light would have
been available.
Through the kindness of a friend, to whom I mentioned this,
and who has found and looked into an old diary, I learn that
new moon occurred in July, 1855, on the 14th of that month.
There was supper after the display of the "spirit-hand," and as
we were not very late home that night, the setting of the moon
which preceded the display could not have been long after ten
o'clock. On referring to Whitaker's Almanack for 1904, I find
that the day in July, 1855, on which the moon, then nearing
her first quarter, must have set soon after ten o'clock was about
the 18th July, certainly not later.
Referring to Whitaker again, it will be seen that there is no
real night until after the 20th July ; which means that until
after that date a faint trace of daylight still lingers in the north
at midnight. It follows that at and for some time after ten
o'clock a fairly luminous sky would be seen through a window,
especially if facing in a westerly or north-westerly direction, and
an object such as the form of "a child's hand with a long
wide sleeve attached to it" intervening between an observer and
the window could well be discerned. (My recollection is that the
window did face in that direction, and indeed had it been other
wise, and that no direct moonlight was coming into the room,
it would hardly have seemed necessary to wait until the moon had
set.)
Mr. Lang speaks of " such light as filters in when the moon has
set on a clear night,"—an expression which seems to me not quite
apposite to the situation in which I saw the object. My whole
description referred to outline only ; in my description as quoted
by him I used no words but such as were applicable to thisj
"outline," "form," "long," "wide." If any one is not satisfied
that the light under the circumstances stated was sufficient to see
what I described, let him test it for himself. I have just done
so, and there is no possible doubt about it. The light is ample
for that purpose. F. MKRRIFIELD.

ENDOWMENT FUND FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.
OUR readers will remember that this Fund was started towards
the end of 1902 for the purpose of endowing a Research
Scholarship in Psychical Science and assisting generally in
the furtherance of the subject. The Council then decided
that the sum of £8000 was the minimum required before
the Scholarship could be founded, and at the end of 1903
the Fund amounted to about £6200.
A special effort is being made to raise another £1000 in
the course of the present year ; Mr. Morris Hudson having
offered to give £50 at the end of the year if by that time
other members shall have given or promised contributions
amounting in all to that sum.

HYPNOTISM :
ITS HISTORY, PRACTICE, AND THEORY.
BY J. MILNE BRAMWELL, M.B., C.M.
8»o. 478 pages. 18». net.
The chief aim of this monograph is to draw the attention of medical men
to the therapeutic value of Hypnotism. The author gives the results of
twelve years of his own practice and research, with personal observations
of the work done in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and
Belgium.
The historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively
little known work of the English pioneers, Elliotson, Esdaile, and Braid,
•while the final chapter of references contains much information which has
not hitherto been published in accessible form.
The methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and
instructions given iii regard to the management of the hypnotic state, with
details as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis. Hypnotic theories are
described and discussed, and special prominence is given to Mr. Myers's
theory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the
problems of hypnotism.

PRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND
ASSOCIATES.
The ninth of the series of Private Meetings for Members
and Associates only was held in the large hall at 20 Hanover
Square, London, W., on Friday, October 21st, at 3.30 p.m.;
the President, Professor Barrett, in the chair.
THE PRESIDENT announced the receipt of a contribution of
£10 to the Endowment Fund from Miss Zula M. Woodhull.
THE HON. EVEKAED FEILDING read some notes on certain cases
recently received. The first of these was a series of experiments
in automatic writing, carried out by Mrs. Verrall and Mrs.
Bradgate at the suggestion of Mr. Baggally, of which it is hoped
that a full report will appear later. Mrs. Verrall and Mrs.
Nov., 1904. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 297
Bradgate arranged to sit on the same day and at the same
hour, once a week, to try for automatic writing, each in her
own house,—Mrs. Verrall at Cambridge and Mrs. Bradgate in
London,—the object being to try whether any correspondences
beyond what could be attributed to chance, or any indication
of an intelligence external to the minds of the two automatists,
would appear in their writings. Eleven sittings were held.
Much of the writing, as always happens, was non-evidential,
but the cumulative effect of repeated instances in which Mrs.
Bradgate's script gave correct statements as to what Mrs.
Verrall or members of her family were doing or thinking about
at the time, or as to some trivial detail in her immediate
surroundings, suggested some kind of telepathic communication
between the minds of the writei'S. On one occasion, Mrs. Verrall
had written a Greek phrase which immediately and inevitably
suggested to her Plato's " Auto agathon " (though she did not
write these words) while on the same occasion the name
" Agatha " had appeared in a detached manner in Mrs. Brad-
gate's script. This might possibly be held to indicate that
some external intelligence was acting simultaneously on the
minds of the two writers.
A short discussion followed the reading of this case.
SIR OLIVER LODGE said that he considered the experiments
to be of great interest and value. In commenting on the
more important coincidences—or, as he thought they should
rather be termed, concordances or correspondences—he said
that the " Agatha " incident seemed to him a remarkable one.
Mrs. Verrall having obtained a Greek line which suggested
" Agathon " to her, and Mrs. Bradgate, at a sitting held con
temporaneously, having obtained the name " Agatha," it would
be interesting to know which of the two writers had got
the idea first.
MRS. VERRALL explained that it was only on reading through
her script, after she had finished it, but before she knew any
thing of what Mrs. Bradgate had written, that the idea of the
" Auto agathon " came to her. The incident therefore could
not be explained as a telepathic transmission of what was
consciously in her mind at the time of the sitting, during
which she was not conscious even of what she was writing ;
but it must of course be assumed that her subliminal con
298 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1904.
sciousness was aware, at least, of the Greek phrase she wrote,
and possibly also had already associated with it the idea of
the "Auto agathon."
In answer to other questions, Mrs. Verrall explained
further that the statements counted as correct in Mrs.
Bradgate's script referred to contemporary incidents, not to
things that had happened at any remote date, so that the
probability of their being correct by chance was much lessened.
The communications did not purport to come from any
particular " communicator."
MR. FEILDING then proceeded to give accounts (1) of a
" haunted house," in which several apparitions were seen by
many different witnesses ; (2) of some hypnotic experiments of
his own with a boy who was an apprentice in the merchant
service. This boy, whom he called Jack Eoyston, was accus
tomed to go into trances, during which he was " controlled " by
what purported to be the spirits of various eminent artists.
Under the supposed influence of these controls, he used to
sketch, blindfolded, outlines and designs for pictures, some of
which had been worked up into finished pictures by an artist
friend of his. The artist himself worked in a semi-automatic
manner, by the direction of the boy's " controls," and often did
not know what was intended to be represented by many of the
details in the pictures till they were explained to him afterwards.
Two of the pictures thus produced were exhibited at the end
of the meeting. They are for sale, and are now to be seen in
the rooms of the Society.
OBITUARY.
SIR AUGUSTUS K. STEPHENSON, K.C., K.C.B.
THE Society has sustained a severe -loss in the recent death
of one of its most distinguished and generous supporters. Sir
Augustus Keppel Stephenson, K.C., K.C.B., who for many years
has taken an active interest in our work, and diligently
co-operated therein, enjoyed a long and distinguished legal
career. Born in 1827, he was a graduate of Caius College,
Cambridge, in 1849; and became a student at Lincoln's Inn in
1846, at the unusually early age of 19 years. With a prudence
not always regarded in recent times, however, he did not hurry
Nov., 1904. Obituary. 299
into forensic practice, and it was six years later before he was
called to the Bar. He attained to considerable practice, par
ticularly in commercial and criminal cases, and so far commended
himself to the notice of the Government of the day as to
receive, in 1875, the appointment of Solicitor to the Treasury.
He had already been for some years Recorder of Bedford.
From 1884 to 1894 he was the director of public prosecu
tions, receiving the distinction of Queen's Counsel in 1890,
and that of K.C.B. in 1885. Of acute intellect, and the most
genial of manners, Sir Augustus endeared himself to all who
were privileged with his acquaintance. He frequently cham
pioned in the press the cause of Psychical Research, and one
of his latest business transactions was to make a special con
tribution to our funds. We are the poorer, intellectually and
financially, by his decease, but the Council will always hold
in grateful remembrance the pleasure and the assistance which
it has received from his labours. He rightly appreciated the
primary importance, in the present stage of our investigations,
of a ceaseless accumulation and sifting of facts, and his critical
acumen in the estimation of their relative value was always
helpful and welcome. He joined the Society as a Member
in 1892, and for the last nine years has been an active member
of the Council.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE INDIAN ROPE-CLIMBING
TRICK.
THE Indian rope-climbing trick is one that is often referred
to, but of which first-hand accounts seem to be extremely
rare,—perhaps because the trick itself is very rarely practised,
so that it has been doubted whether it is ever performed
at all. Dr. Hodgson writes (Journal, Vol. V. p. 85) that the
story is, in one form or another, very old, and that when he
was in India he made many enquiries about it, but " failed to
meet any person who had witnessed anything that might have
served as a foundation for the story." Again, he states in his
article on Indian Magic and the Testimony of Conjurers (Pro
ceedings, Vol. IX. p. 363): "The performances of all the
jugglers whom I saw were unquestionably conjuring tricks,
300 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1904.
and I sought in vain for an eye-witness, European or native,
of the famous rope-exploit of which we have heard so much
in travellers' tales. About three years ago a story spread
that this supposed trick was explicable by ' hypnotism.' It
was alleged that certain travellers had proved this by means
of a kodak. The kodak showed no such scenes,—rope taut
as though fixed to an inevitable point in the air, disappearing
boy, man following with a knife,—bloody limbs and trunk, and
head falling,—reintegration of the boy's organism, etc. This
story turned out, by the confession of its author, to be a
' yarn,' as was obvious to myself when it first appeared,^
not only from the indications of the drawings given with the
story, but because the famous ' mango ' or tree-growing trick
was explained in the same way, viz., by hypnotic suggestion ;
whereas I was well aware that the latter was a simple con
juring trick, every detail of which was known to me."
We were informed, however, a short time ago by one of
our members, Mr. F. W. Hayes, that he knew a gentleman
who had witnessed the rope trick, and would be willing to
give us an account of it. Mr. Baggally therefore called on
him and obtained from him the following statement :
March 19th, 1904.
I, Sebastian Thomas Burchett, of No. 31 Westcroft Square,
Ravenscourt Park, witnessed the Indian rope-climbing trick at
Umballa in 1900 or 1901. I do not recollect the exact date.
A crowd of natives witnessed it at the same time. There were
also present many English soldiers belonging to the 4th Royal
Irish Dragoons, the Somerset Light Infantry, and the 2nd West
Surreys.
I cannot give the names of any European witnesses who were
present on this occasion. Corporal Bidie, of the 4th Royal Irish
Dragoons, D Squadron, now stationed at Muttra, Bengal Presi
dency, informed me that he had witnessed the same kind of
performance, but whether with the same conjurer I do not know.
I could not say at what time the performance took place. If I
remember rightly it was in the morning, at about 11 o'clock. The
day was a fine one.
A few minor tricks, with birds and a cage, • were done by the
conjurer before he performed the rope-climbing trick. The audi
Nov., 1904. Account of tlie Indian Rope-Climbing Trick. 301
ence stood in a circle round an open space, in the centre of which
the conjurer stood. There were no trees near.
The rope was in a coil on the ground. The conjurer took one
end and raised it hand over hand ; it appeared to ascend to a
height of about 15 to 20 feet.
The raised portion of the rope remained erect, while the other
portion lay in a coil on the ground. The conjurer then got hold
of a small boy, and said something to him in Hindustani. The boy
then began to climb the rope, hand over hand, with legs twisted
round the rope in the ordinary way of climbing. When he got to
the top the boy disappeared, but I could not tell the exact
moment of disappearance. One seemed to be gradually aware
that he had disappeared, but not able to fix the exact moment of
disappearance. The conjurer then commenced to harangue the
crowd and to ask where the boy was. The boy then appeared in
the open space, but I do not remember whether he descended the
rope or came from the outside of the crowd.
After the performance I spoke to several soldiers of the 4th
Royal Irish Dragoon Guards, who told me that they had witnessed
the disappearance of the boy.
(Signed) SEBASTIAN THOMAS BUKCHETT.
Witness, W. W. BAGGALLY.
The above statement was signed in my presence by Mr. S. T.
Burchett, in the house of Mr. F. W. Hayes, No. 12 Westcroft
Square. The latter gentleman being present at the same time.
Mr. S. T. Burchett is a gentleman about 24 years of age. He
gave me the impression of being absolutely truthful. As this is
one of those rare cases of an Englishman who has personally wit
nessed the Indian rope-climbing trick, it is to be regretted that he
was unable to give the names of other Europeans who witnessed
this performance at the same time.
W. W. BAGGALLY.
Mr. Hayes then wrote to Mr. Baggally :
12 WESTCROFT SQUARE, W., March 20, 1904.
After our conversation with Mr. Burchett last night, I made a
fresh search for my rough notes of the account he gave me (imme
diately after his arrival in London from India) of the rope-climbing
performance he had witnessed, and to-day I found them.
As I mislaid these notes' before I could make a clean copy, and
302 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1904.
as Mr. Burchett was not easily available to get his account again,
I had no opportunity of getting a signed account, and therefore
send you an exact copy of my rough notes of his statement, which
I am quite positive represent what was at the time a vivid, precise,
and unhesitating recollection of his experience a few weeks pre
viously.
F. W. HAYES.
The following was the account enclosed in Mr. Hayes's letter.
It was afterwards submitted to Mr. Burchett, and signed by
him as correct :
12 WESTCROFT SQUARE, W.,
Mar. 20th, 1904.
Copy of statement taken down verbatim from Mr. S. T. Burchett,
Jan. 7, 1902, by me, F. W. Hayes.
"About 11 a.m. one hot morning in the first week of November,
1901, while I was at Umballa, a native conjurer [came] to the
camp, accompanied by a boy, and offered to give a performance.
The man carried a bag containing a few small articles used in his
feats, and the boy bore on his head a basket. After saying he
would commence with the rope trick, the man took up his station
with the boy in the open ground before the bungalow. About 30
Europeans, including myself, stood round him, forming a complete
circle not more than 4 yards in diameter. About 30 natives
stood outside to look on.
"The conjurer took from his basket a rope about an inch thick,
and probably 8 yards long, which he coiled on the ground. From
his bag he produced a monkey's skull, painted red, and held it
out in his right hand, while he addressed to it the words [in Hindo-
stanee, omitted to be taken down]. This form of conjuration was
repeated with every succeeding trick. He then squatted down on
his heels, took hold of the end of the rope, and holding it upright,
passed it upwards with a hand-under-hand movement as if he were
lifting a straight rod out of the earth.
"The rope went up in the air rigidly until the end was about
20 feet from the ground. The conjuror now stopped, said another
charm, and stood up, leaving the rope in the air, and the unused
portion still coiled on the ground. He then held his hand just over
the boy's head, and signed to him to climb the rope, which he
did, hand-over-hand. I have no recollection of whether he used
feet or not.
Nov., 1904. Account of the Indian Rope-Climbing Trick. 303
"About a foot from the top of the rope the boy stopped, and a
second or two afterwards vanished absolutely. The man called
out, and we heard the boy's voice replying from up in the air.
Then, just as suddenly as he had disappeared, the boy became
visible again, and climbed down to the ground. The rope sank
after him, and we examined it again.
"From what was said amongst the European spectators while this
performance was going on, and from what transpired in subsequent
discussions, I am satisfied that all of us saw the same things
occur, and saw them at the same respective stages.
"SEBASTIAN T. BURCHETT."
Mr. Baggally then sent the following questions to Mr.
Burchett :
(1) How was the boy dressed when he climbed the rope?
(2) Did the boy proceed to undress when he got to the top 1
(3) Did he throw his clothes down ?
(4) Did the conjurer throw anything up into the air when the boy
was at the top 1
(5) Did the conjurer light a fire and make a smoke ?
Mr. Burchett replied as follows :
March 21th, 1904.
(1) The boy was dressed, as far as I remember, with just a
loose cloth round the middle; the cloth is just wrapped round,
then passed between the legs, and tucked in [at] the waist.
(2) Not in this instance, though the undressing is a usual detail
of the performance.
(3) No.
(4) No.
(5) No fire or smoke.
I understand from other people who have witnessed the trick in
various places, that sometimes the juggler himself climbs up the
rope after the boy, and also disappears. Then the limbs of the boy
are thrown down one by one ; first, a leg, then an arm, and so on.
This variation I have never seen myself, so cannot vouch for it.
With regard to any further details I cannot bring any to mind.
I saw Mr. Hayes last night, and he read over to me my original
statement, taken down almost immediately after my arrival in
England, which was Dec. 23rd, 1901. The date on which Mr.
Hayes interviewed [me] was Jan. 7th, 1902.
304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1904.
There is, I see, a discrepancy in the two narratives with regard to
•one detail, i.e. the reappearance of the boy. I have evidently got
the details, or at least that particular one, somewhat mixed up
with the basket trick, which I witnessed twice.
I therefore take this opportunity of stating that the boy
reappeared and descended, the rope appearing to come down with
him.
Mr. Hayes' narrative is a very good one, and I am prepared
to sign it.
S. T. BURCHETT.
In spite of the evident care taken to report the incident
correctly, it will be observed that there are several discrepancies
between Mr. Burchett's earlier and his later accounts, the
principal ones being the following:
(1) The first (i.e. earlier) account states that the conjurer
came to the camp, accompanied by a boy : the second, that
after doing some preliminary tricks, he "got hold of a small
boy," as if the boy had no previous connection with him.
(2) In the first account, the conjurer began with the rope
trick ; in the second he did " a few minor tricks " first.
(3) In the first account the boy went up the rope hand
over hand, and, says Mr. Burchett, " I have no recollection of
whether he used feet or not." In the second account he says,
" The boy then began to climb the rope hand over hand, with
legs twisted round the rope in the ordinary way of climbing."
(4) In the first account, after the boy had disappeared, " the
man called out, and we heard the boy replying from up in
the air." In the second account this incident is omitted
altogether.
(5) The first account says, "Just as suddenly as he had
disappeared the boy became visible again, and climbed down
to the ground. The rope sank after him." The second account
says, " The boy then appeared in the open space, but I do
not remember whether he descended the rope, or came from
the outside of the crowd."
The comparison illustrates once more the unreliability of
memory with regard to such incidents as these. It is true
that the first account is considerably more detailed than the
second, and the narrative has lost rather than gained in its
remarkable features by lapse of time ; the most important
Nov., 1904. Account of the Indian Rope-Climbing Trick. 305-
detail which has been added in the second version relating to
the action of the boy's legs in climbing. Forgetfulness how
ever, quite as much as the mythopceic tendency, may result
in misleading impressions.
We cannot tell whether the things forgotten at the later
stage in this case—viz., that the boy came with the conjurer,
and that they heard his voice replying from up in the air,—
have or have not any bearing on the explanation of the
mystery, as we do not know how the trick was performed ;
but it is obvious that one of the main obstacles to explana
tion is the great difficulty of getting a really complete and
accurate account of what happened.
The trick as described seems on the face of it to contain
two principal elements ; (a) the rope standing upright in the
air, and becoming sufficiently rigid to support the weight of
the boy as he climbed up ; (6) the disappearance of the boy.
With regard to (a), it is perhaps not inconceivable that a
trick rope might be constructed, with a jointed core of some
rigid material, so arranged that the joints would become rigid
when placed in a particular position ; but this is, of course, a
mere hypothesis.
With regard to (6), it is difficult to explain the disappear
ance of the boy as anything but a negative hallucination,
similar to those that can be imposed on susceptible hypnotic
subjects, when a person or object is made to appear invisible
to them. Slight and momentary occurrences of this kind are
not uncommon in ordinary life ; e.g. it has probably happened
to most of us to be unable to find some object that we wish
to use and then to re-discover it under our eyes in the precise
place where we have been looking for it. What seems to
happen in such cases is not a momentary distraction of atten
tion from the object, but a momentary incapacity to interpret
the sense impressions derived from it. In the case of the
negative hallucinations of hypnotic subjects, this incapacity is
imposed on them deliberately by the verbal suggestion of'
the hypnotist, and there is of course no difficulty in imposing
it on several subjects at once.
In the case of the rope trick, it would be absurd to suppose
that the spectators were hypnotised, and though there is plenty
of evidence for the production by suggestion alone, without
306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1904.
hypnosis, of many of the effects that can be produced by
hypnotism—curative and other—there is not much evidence
for the production by this means of negative hallucinations.
It is, however, an important part of the equipment of the
ordinary conjurer to be able to guide the perceptions of the
spectators, so that they see certain things and not others,
according to what he wishes. And it is not impossible that
oriental conjurers have attained to a much greater skill in
this way than Europeans ; though it must again be remem
bered that this is only a hypothesis.
To illustrate it, we print here a letter addressed to Mr.
E. Gurney in 1887 by a Japanese gentleman, who was then
resident at Oxford. The letter is as follows:
DEAR SIR, July Uth, 1887.
In reply to your letter, I venture to relate the
following account of a scene which I witnessed when I was in my
own country last :
It was many years ago, when I was residing at Osaka, that I
was invited to attend a certain juggling-trick entertainment at a
relative's. The performer who was engaged on that occasion was
said to be one of the best jugglers in the empire. He had then
ceased to perform in public, but occasionally came to private houses
as a favour. There were about twenty present, who were either
our relations or intimate friends of ours. The juggler, after per
forming many wonderful tricks, called upon us to observe attentively
all the people in the room, and where they were sitting. Then he
said, "I am about to produce a certain disappearance. But before
1 can fulfil this intention I must ask you to observe a few rules
which I now venture to mention : Firstly, no one must move from
his seat while this performance lasts ; secondly, you are not to
converse or communicate with your neighbour, or, in other words,
you are not to utter a single word ; and lastly, you must not touch
your neighbour." We of course agreed to his proposal. Then he
sat opposite to us with his eyes closed, pretending to sleep. There
ensued a perfect silence, during which even the dropping of a pin
might be heard all over the room. We, many of us, naturally
thought that he was going to disappear, so we watched him closely.
But to our disappointment, he was still on his seat, when at last
he opened his eyes drowsily. He then looked round the audience
with a disappointed expression, and sighed ; but not a word was
Nov., 190*. Account of the Indian Rope-Climbing Trick. 307
uttered. Every one in the room looked terrified and awestruck,
while the performer glared at us with his wild eyes in a way
which made us almost shiver. Suddenly the silence was broken :
"I understand not," exclaimed the juggler, "why you cannot
keep your promise. I asked you to remain in your seats while
this performance was going on ! What do I see now ? Many
seats are empty ! " The audience, who had hitherto been watching
the performer, at once turned their attention to themselves,
not imagining that any one had left the room. Strange indeed !
There were many empty seats which had been occupied a minute
before. Could this mystery be performed by this fellow-mortal 1
Was it a mesmeric glamour thrown over our minds and senses ?
But where had they gone to ? An explanation is impossible.
We sat there watching those empty seats with utter amazement.
Then followed another dead silence ; whereupon the juggler stood
up and spoke as follows : " Ladies and gentlemen, I think this
perhaps is the trick I intended to show you. You have tried hard
to keep your promises, but you are overpowered by me." After a
few minutes' pause, he requested us to shut our eyes for a second
or two, in order, he said, that the lost or disappeared souls might
return without hesitation. To this we also agreed, and when his
signal was given we found all the seats were filled again as before.
We enquired of those who had disappeared, or seemed to be not
there, asking where they had gone, and when they had returned.
They answered that they had been there all the time, and had
themselves seen the empty seats of others. And this was confirmed
by those who had been sitting next to the persons who had dis
appeared. Thus everybody in the room saw different persons
disappear. . . . ISNETA MORI.
With regard to the writer of this letter, Mr. E. N. Bennett
writes to us:
HERTFORD COLLEGE, OXFORD,
October 3rd, 1904.
. . . [This is what I have] discovered from the proprietor of the
" Old Parsonage," Banbury Road, Oxford, as to the Japanese Isneta
Mori. [He] was there, as you say, in 1887, and was then a young
man of, say, 21, so that "many years ago," "when I was in my own
country " would bring one back to a very early age—at least early
for first class evidential powers ! As far as I can learn, he was a
young man of pleasant address and was regarded as thoroughly
308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1904.
honest and straightforward. The proprietor informs me that he
subsequently heard on fairly good authority that Isneta Mori had
met with a violent death—he used the word " assassinated." That
is practically all I have gathered as to this Japanese who was in
Oxford for about one year only.
With regard to the age of the narrator at the time he
witnessed the performance, it would seem from the context
that the phrase " many years ago " is used loosely and pro
bably does not mean more than a few years ago,—especially
in conjunction with the preceding words " when I was in my
own country last." If he had been a child at the time, he
would probably have mentioned it ; but it does not seem
possible now to obtain any further confirmation of the story,
so that we can only print it as it stands.

HYPNOTISM :
ITS HISTORY, PRACTICE, AND THEORY.
BY J. MILNE BRAMWELL, M.B., C.M.
Svo. 4~& pages. IS*, net.
The chief aim of this monograph is t» draw the attention of medical men
to the therapeutic value of Hypnotism. The author gives the results of
twelve years of his own practice and re.-earch, with personal observations
of the work done in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and
Belgium.
The historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively
little known work of the English pioneers, Elliotson, Esdaile, and Braid,
while the final chapter of references contains much information which has
not hitherto been published in accessible form.
The methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and
instructions given in regard to the management of the hypnotic state, with
details as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis. Hypnotic theories are
described and discussed, and- special prominence is given to Mr. Mvers's
theory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the
problems of hypnotism.

A CASE OF AUTOMATIC INTELLIGENCE.
BY SIR OLIVER LODGE.
THE following is an interesting case of subliminal or automatic
intelligence apparently greater than the normal intelligence of the
sitter at the time. One of its features of interest is that the
witness is exceptionally competent. The account was handed to
me at a recent meeting of the Society by the Eev. William
Eoberts, of 76 Kensington Gardens Square, and it was written
by an old student of my own at Bedford College in the seventies
—one of the ablest students there—Miss C. M. Pole, daughter of
the late Dr. Pole, F.B.S., the well-known Engineer, Musician, and
authority on Whist. Miss Pole is now Mrs. Garrett Smith,
living at Magdeburg, and writes as follows :—
In the early part of 1885 I was staying at in the house of
Mrs. Q., and I and her daughter, Miss Q., B.A. Lond., used to
amuse ourselves in writing with a Planchette. We had several
Planchettes (I think four), but we could only get response from
one of them, which belonged to Miss Q. In the house with us
were some eight or nine others, . . . but for no other pair would
the Planchette act, The same one had formerly given good results
with Miss Q. and another friend, but I have never written with
a Planchette before or since. We got all sorts of nonsense out of
it, sometimes long doggerel rhymes with several verses. Sometimes
310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1904.
we asked for prophecies, but I do not remember ever getting one
which came true, and my impression is that generally when we asked
for a prophecy the thing went off in a straight line—running off the
table if we did not take our hands off. It often did this, refusing to
write at all, and towards the end of my stay there I believe it was
always so ; we could get no answer from it. I believe we often asked
Planchette who the guiding spirit was ; but I only once remember
getting a definite connected answer. Then it wrote that his name was
"Jim," and that he had been a Senior Wrangler. After other
questions we asked it to write the equation to its own curve
[in other words, to express mathematically the outline of the heart-
shaped board]. Planchette wrote something like this quite distinctly—
(The curl backwards, always denoted that the answer was finished.)
We repeated the question several times, but each time the answer was
the same, sometimes more, sometimes less distinct. We interpreted
it as r — —~— Miss Q. had never done any work in Polar co
ordinates at all and did not know how to use them. I had about a
year previously done some elementary work with them when working
for the B.Sc. Exam., London University, and I knew just enough to
be able to draw the curve represented by the equation. In my first
try I made a mistake and believed the curve to be quite a different
one, but afterwards I drew the following, a double never-ending spiral :
DEC., 1904. A Case of Automatic Intelligence. 311
We checked our result by taking the equation to the Mathematical
Master at the Boys' College, who drew the same curve for us, but we
did not tell him where we got the equation from. I cannot say
whether the Planchette we used was really exactly the shape of the
outside curve ; I should rather fancy that with the heart shape the
resemblance ended. I am quite sure that I had never seen the curve
before, and therefore the production of the equation could not have
been an act of unconscious memory on my part. Also I most certainly
did not know enough mathematics to know how to form an equation
which would represent such a curve, or to know even of what type the
equation must be. But I had come across snch equations and drawn
the curves represented by them—for instance, afterwards I found in
my note-book the spiral rd = —, and the cardioid r = a(l +cos &). We
had used no text-book, and in the full notes of the lectures I had
attended, these were the two curves I found most similar to Plan-
chette's. If my brain produced the equation written by Planchette, it
must have been that I unconsciously formed an equation like some I
had seen before, which by a curious coincidence chanced to represent
a heart-shaped curve.
I know that we were both quite unconscious of any influence we
may have exercised on the Planchette.
CECILIA GARRETT SMITH.
MAGDEBURG, November, 1903.
Mr. Roberts wrote to Miss Q., sending her this account, and
asking for her recollections of the incident, and she replies as
follows (asking us not to publish her full name and address).
March 12th, 1904.
The planchette is not now in existence or I would make a sketch
of it for you, but I remember distinctly that (1) there was a cusp
at the dimple of the heart, and (2) that the curve at the other end
crossed the axis so that there was only one tangent at the point,
and that one was perpendicular to the axis.
The rest of Mrs. Garrett Smith's account is substantially what I
remember except in a few details.
(1) I am described as not having done any work in Polar Co
ordinates and Miss Pole as having done only elementary work in
them. This was not the case—I had taken my degree in Mathe
matics then, and used them freely, and so I think had Miss Pole.
What I had not learnt to do was to trace curves from their
312 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1904.
equations, and it was for this reason that I could not test planchette's
answer. (2) I did not remember that Miss Pole had attempted to
trace the curve. . . .
I (0. L.) made inquiries about Miss Q., and found that she
was well known to friends of mine, and was a serious and
responsible and trustworthy person, so I wrote some further
questions to her, and received the following reply :—
March 23rd, 1904.
... As far as Miss Pole and I were concerned, it was quite bona-
fidS, and was not open to any suspicion of practical joking or
setting traps for each other. It is true that when we wrote planchette,
it was never with any serious motive, such as with the object of
testing the unconscious mind, or for any scientific purpose, but
merely for the fun of the thing. We used to ask it to prophesy
future events, and to make up poetry, and all purely for amusement,
after the manner of schoolgirls. Nevertheless, all that was written
was quite in good faith.
The equation written did not come within the mathematical
knowledge I then possessed, which was limited to the mathematics
necessary for the London B.A. Pass Degree. I knew of course that
every curve could be represented by an equation, and I was familiar
with polar co-ordinates in which the equation was written. But the
only equations I could then identify were those of the conic sections.
Miss Pole had read some elementary Differential, and knew more
than I did, but my impression is that her knowledge was not
sufficient to enable her to trace curves.
Certainly neither of us perceived from the appearance of the
equation that the reply was the correct one, but that I think would
have been too much to expect, even if our knowledge had been
much higher than it was.
I did not know sufficient at that time to attempt to plot the
curve. I believe Miss Pole did attempt it, but if so, her attempts
were unsuccessful. We were not satisfied that the equation did
represent a curve like the outline of the planchette till we had
asked our mathematical master to trace it for us. (This was done
without telling him any of the facts of the case.)
I do not remember that we ever closely compared the curve he
drew in tracing the equation with the actual planchette in question.
We did not take the matter very seriously, and were quite content
when we saw that the solution was at all events approximately true.
DEC., 1904. A Case of Automatic Intelligence. 313
On now tracing the curve represented by the equation, I am
inclined to think that it very closely resembles the shape of the
actual planchette used, from my memory of it. (The planchette is
no longer in existence.) . . .
Concerning these statements, it is, as Mrs. Garrett Smith says,
unfortunate that the actual shape of the Planchette board was
not recorded ; so that there is no means now of ascertaining in
what way the curve met the horizontal axis, whether there ought
to be a cusp at the dimple of the heart, and especially whether
the longer branches of the curve are continuous, or, as in the sketch
she first made, intersect the axis at about 45°. If the sketch is
correct in this particular,1 the equation given is not; for the curve
represented by the equation would cross the axis normally. The
equation which would naturally occur to any one is the cardioid
r = a(l -(-cos 0); but it is quite likely, as Mrs. Garrett Smith
says, that although as a student she was undoubtedly aware of
this curve, she might not, some years afterward, be able to repro
duce it on demand.
The equation written by Planchette is not a familiar one
and certainly would not be likely to occur to her, nor would
it have occurred to me ; it may possibly represent the actual
outline of the board better than a cardioid or than some other
of the equations which are written below, but it does not appear
to represent the rough sketch exceptionally well.
I asked my brother, Alfred Lodge, Professor of Pure Mathe
matics at the Eoyal Indian Engineering College, Coopers Hill, to
suggest an equation that fitted the sketch, and he suggested
r = a#2, and r= 2(10*/ir— 1), both of which seem to me better to
represent the sketch than either a cardioid or the Planchette
equation. He also suggested a series, expanding r in powers of 0,
which comes to very much the same thing as the Planchette equation.
Hence I think it may be said,—giving it the benefit of some
doubt as to the actual shape of the board, on the ground that
when Miss Pole drew the curve her recollection is that it agreed
moderately well with the real outline,—that the equation written
by Planchette is not unworthy of a mathematician, and I should
agree with Mrs. Garrett Smith in considering it distinctly beyond
her normal power of rapid suggestion under the circumstances.
1 Mrs. Garrett Smith explained later that her rough sketch was incorrect in this
point, the loiiger branches of the curve beiug continuous, and the diagram given
above is corrected accordingly.
314 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 19M.
When I asked my brother to suggest a curve to correspond
to a heart-shaped board, I sent him nothing but the outline of
Mrs. Garrett Smith's sketch, and did not tell him any of the
circumstances. Afterwards I supplied him with the information
and he wrote again as follows :—
" It is a pity the exact shape of the Planchette was not traced.
Perhaps all planchettes are the same shape ? The cardioid
r = a (1 -f cos 0) is better in a sense than r = a . as the latter
u
goes through the origin and twirls away for ever, whereas the
cardioid stops there in a cusp. But IF the exact shape of the
planchette were known it might be that —^— fits it better
than a (1 + cos 0).
I may say that the f £>A^ angle at A put me off such a
solution as —g-, although it had gone through my mind that a
(7
series of powers of 6 would be useful to try. I tried getting the
cusp when $•= 0, letting the angle at A take care of itself.
A. L."
[The above case is perhaps the only one among our records in
which automatic writing has shown an extension of faculty
beyond the ordinary powers of the automatist in this particular
direction. It is comparatively common to find in automatic
phenomena the faculties of memory and observation heightened,
and with them the capacity of putting two and two together and
drawing inferences. But this is not quite the same thing as
concrete reasoning of a technical kind. The latter is comparable
rather to the performances of " calculating boys " or the solving
of problems in dreams, of which a striking case was given in an
article by Dr. Eomaine Newbold in Proceedings, Vol. XII., pp.
11-13. Some of Mr. Gurney's hypnotic subjects used to work
sums with a planchette in response to post-hypnotic suggestions
—rather more quickly, but apparently not more correctly than
they could have done in their normal state. (See Proceedings,
Vol. IV., pp. 304-6 and Vol. V., pp. 3-9). But these experi
ments were directed chiefly to showing the capacity of the
subliminal self to carry on a piece of reasoning while the supra-
liminal consciousness was fully occupied with some other train of
DKC., 1904. A Case of Automatic Intelligence. 315
thought;—e.g. when a subject correctly multiplied 12s. 3fd. by
8, repeating aloud " God save the Queen " meanwhile, with every
other word left out. On the other hand, in Dr. Bramwell's
experiments on the hypnotic appreciation of time (Proceedings,
Vol. XII., pp. 179-193) one at least of his subjects was able not
only to remember figures better but to calculate more correctly
with some stratum of her subliminal consciousness, than with
her normal consciousness. Mr. Gurney's and Dr. Bramwell's
cases, however, relate only to questions of simple arithmetical
calculations. EDITOR.]
CASES.
L. 1140. Motor Impulse.
The following case has been received from a correspondent
in New Zealand. As she has requested us not to give the
names of the persons concerned, (all of which have been
communicated to us privately), assumed names are substituted
for the real ones throughout the narrative, and we call the
narrator Miss Butler. She writes as follows :
March 30th, 1904.
Six years ago I was living with my father and a sister and
brother on a farm, 5 miles from the nearest township and about 60
miles from Wellington. My friend, Miss Wilson, was living here
in Wellington with her mother, and Miss Wilson and I kept up a
regular correspondence. One morning I awoke very early and felt
a strong desire to write a story. I sat up in bed and began at
once. I finished it at about noon, and when my sister asked me
to read it aloud to her, I said I could not, as the idea was so
painful, and that I had put Mrs. Wilson in as one of the characters
and that she died of cancer. I felt very depressed. Of course, as
far as any of us knew, Mrs. Wilson was quite well and we had
never associated this disease with her. Nevertheless I wished I
had not written the story. This happened on a Sunday, and on
the next day I received a long letter from Miss Wilson telling me
that her mother had been operated on successfully on the preced
ing day (Sunday) at noon for cancer. She explained that she and
her mother had known of the necessity for the operation for 10
days before, and that she had written me a letter telling me of it
as soon as she knew, but that her mother bad persuaded her to
316 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1904.
destroy the letter, because of our living so far from the post and
telegraph office, and because our mails were so irregular. Mrs.
Wilson was a thoughtful woman and knew that we would be very
nervous, and had no means of communicating quickly with them. Miss
Wilson therefore had written just as regularly as usual, but had given
us no idea that anything was amiss. A fortnight later Mrs. Wilson died.
Most of my intimate friends know of this incident, and up till
quite recently I possessed the manuscript. My sister and my brother
knew I had written it, before we had even heard Mrs. Wilson was ill.
To the whole of the narrative, another extract from which
is given below, the following note is attached :
March 30th, 1904.
We have read the paper written by my sister for the S. P. K.
and wish to say that the occurrences took place in the order in
which she has described them. M. BUTLEU (sister).
M. WILSON.
Miss Wilson writes further :
June 29tt, 1904.
I read your letter to Miss Butler, and am going to give you as
clearly as I can an account of my mother's illness and death, both
of which are still so vivid in my mind that they might have
occurred just the other day.
On July the 3rd, 1897, I came home in the evening from having
given my music lessons, and my mother told me that she had seen
Dr. A . I had asked her to see him on account of her having
complained of something being the matter with her foot. I don't
remember what it was, but nothing serious. She had put off doing
this for some time, and I afterwards found that her reason for
doing this was because she feared that she had cancer, as she
had noticed a peculiar lump in her breast, and she dreaded
the doctor confirming her fears. It seems that she had noticed it
some months previously, but as we had a lady suffering from the
same complaint staying with us at the time, she (my mother) had
not said anything about it even to me, and as she suffered no pain
whatever, but was apparently in her usual good health, I suppose
she hoped it was her imagination, and that the lump perhaps would
disappear. At any rate, neither I nor any one else had the least
idea that anything was the matter with her. Well, when Dr.
A came that day she summoned up courage to ask him about
it, and he was very horrified and distressed to find that she was
right. He said there must be an operation as soon as possible.
DBC., 1904. Cases. 317
Two other doctors, Dr. C and Dr. F , were called in con
sultation, and they all three agreed that there was no reason to
suppose that the operation would be anything but successful.
Directly I knew about it I naturally wanted to let my friend—a
friend of over twenty-five years—know about it, and ray mother,
knowing I would write at once and tell her, begged me not to do
so until it was over, for she said she knew what a dreadful shock
it would be to her, and also that living away in the country,—out
of reach of telegrams, and where the mails were not regular or
always easy to get,—both she and her sister and brother would have
such an anxious time. I therefore did not mention the fact or
even hint in any of my letters that there was anything wrong, but
just wrote as usual. On Sunday morning, July 19th, 1897, my
mother was operated on for cancer, and when this was over I wrote
to my friend and told her everything. I knew it would be a great
shock to her, for when she had seen my mother last—in May I
think it was—she was, for all we knew, perfectly well and just as
bright as ever she had been. For the fortnight following the
operation everything went on in the most satisfactory way possible.
There were no relapses of any kind, but on the afternoon of
Monday, August 3rd, there seemed to be a sudden collapse, and at
about twelve o'clock that night she died. I telegraphed to Miss
Butler, and she came to me at once. I do not remember if Miss
Butler wrote and told me during the fortnight following the
operation, or whether she told me after my mother's death, that
on the morning of July 19th she had waked up very early and
told her sister that she felt she wanted to write a little story,
that the plot was a most unpleasant one, but that she felt she
must write it down, and then perhaps she would get it off her
mind. Her sister, Miss M. Butler, said that she would get the break
fast while Miss Butler wrote the story. When it was finished, she
said she would like either to read it or tell it to Miss M. I do
not know which she did, but at any rate one of the chief characters
in the story was my mother, and the story was being written on the
exact day and at the exact time of the operation, and Miss Butler
knew nothing from me as far as we knew, nor could she have
heard from any one else, for we told no one that everything was
not as usual. On the Monday morning she had my letter telling her my
reasons for having kept from her the knowledge of what was impending.
I know for a fact that the story was written on that morning,
and I have no doubt that her sister,—who is in the country, but
318 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC.,
who, I believe, is writing to you by this mail,—will tell you the
same. M. WILSON.
P.S.—This letter was written without any consultation with or
appeal to either Miss Butler or any one else, and is just what I
remember of the case.
A number of letters of condolence received by Miss Wilson
after the death of her mother were also sent to us. These
confirm independently the date of the death, and several of
them refer to the extreme suddenness of the illness. Miss
Butler's sister writes further:
July I3lh, 1904.
... I am sorry I cannot give you any further details of her
writing about Mrs. Wilson's cancer just before she had heard that
Mrs. Wilson was suffering from it; and as I have already corrobo
rated my sister's statement of the case, perhaps that is all you
require.
In the remainder of Miss Butler's narrative, she describes
several other experiences,—some apparently subjective halluci
nations or impressions, and some apparently premonitory visions
relating to the death of her father, then aged about 86. She
also describes a course of self-suggestion, from which her
health greatly benefitted, as follows:
Shortly after Mrs. Wilson's death I came to live with Miss
Wilson, and a little over two years ago the Vicar of our Church
lent us a book—"Psychic Phenomena"—by -Hudson. We found it
very interesting, and attempted some thought-reading experiments
with cards. We failed, and gradually the author's ideas faded from
our minds.
All my life I have suffered from indigestion, sick headaches,
relaxed throats, etc. I had got into the habit of taking two or
three pills every night, and my diet was painfully restricted. I
was afraid to eat anything but the plainest food, and my weight
(I am 5 ft. 6 ins. about) was 8 stone.
Itbegan to worry more than usual over this state of things, and
then the idea came to me that I might give Hudson's theory a trial.
I had no faith—at least I was not conscious of any—but I told
myself it would not hurt me to give it a three months' trial, and
that if I failed I would be no worse off. So I began.
For, say, three weeks I saw and felt no improvement in my
health that I could feel justified in putting down to mental sug
DEC., 1904. Cases. 319
gestion, but after that, I began to realise that my sore throats did
somehow seem less frequent. My headaches were more persistent,
but still they came less often, and finally I realised that I could eat
practically anything, as long as I made a point of eating practically
anything ! I began this course eighteen months ago about, and for
a year or a little more I have not taken any medicine. I am much
fatter, and in fact am a different woman. My method as regards
self-suggestion is as follows: Three or four times during the day I
walked up and down in the privacy of my own room, repeating aloud
a formula which I seldom varied, in which moral, mental and physical
traits which I felt the need of were insisted on. I did not believe
in the efficacy of this treatment one bit,—I just made myself do
it,—but I felt most of the time that it was extremely ridiculous, and
I had an uneasy inward feeling that it might end in my going insane.
I used also to lie down every morning an hour before one o'clock
dinner and repeat the suggestions again. I always lay on my back
and gazed at the ceiling.
Ever since I was a child—I am now 47—I have been liable at
intervals, and seemingly unconnected with my health, to a sort
of nervous terror, generally at night, but also coming on at any
time during the day. These attacks are less frequent than they
used to be, and I have learned latterly to control them. That is to
say, though they come, I am not overcome by them. Within the
last eighteen months I have gained, by [the methods of mental sug
gestion just described], a strange control over them which is difficult
to explain, but which is as if—while on the surface my nerves and
heart and sensations are all throbbing with fear—there is a perfectly
quiet and calm spot underneath it all. I tma like a pool of water,
all of which was lashed about, and now I am more like the sea,
which is only lashed on the top. I am not attempting to be
poetical. . . .
It must be observed, however, that some of the obviously
subjective hallucinations above referred to occurred during the
process of self-suggestion ; also Miss Butler describes two
occasions on which she suffered a severe attack of nervous
unreasoning terror after attempting the experiment of in
fluencing a person at a distance according to the method
prescribed by Hudson.
With regard to the improvement in her health (of which
she was not able to send us any evidence from a medical man,
since she had bad no medical treatment for it) her sister writes :
320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1904.
July 13th, 1904.
... I can only say that the alteration in her health is wonderful ; she
never suffers from nervous headache, indigestion, or sore-throat now,
though she was seldom free from one or other of them before. She
is able to eat everything, no matter how rich, and nothing disagrees
with her as it did when she was dieting herself.
Miss Wilson also writes on the same subject in the letter
quoted from above, as follows :
As to Miss Butler's health. All I can say is that what she
wrote to you is absolutely true. She has, ever since I have known
her, taken medicine constantly; in fact, as far as I can remember,
she has taken it every night, and always increasing the doses. A
year after my mother died she came to live with me for good, so I
was a personal witness to the increase of these doses. Then we
began to be very interested in reading of telepathy, hypnotism, sug
gestion, etc., and she determined that she would try suggestion to
cure herself of the habit of having to take medicine at all. She
went into all the details of this, I think, in her letter to you, and I
can only verify her statement, both with regard to that complaint
and also what she said about her food. When first she came to me,
she could not eat this and she could not eat that without having a
sick headache, or something of the sort. Now she eats anything she
fancies, and never has to wonder what will be the results. This, I
believe, she accomplished by saying to herself that there was no
reason why she should not be able to eat such and such a thing,
for she was perfectly healthy, and it would not disagree with her,
and it didn't. I cannot remember when she last had a headache,
and her sore throats, which used to be very frequent and also very
severe, she has disposed of in the same way, and she never now
has to take medicine. She has gained considerably in weight since
practising this suggestion, and is quite a different woman to when
she first came to live with me. M. WILSON.
L. 1141. Collective Auditory.
The first account of this case was sent to us by an
Honorary Associate, Mr. J. F. Young, of Llanelly, South Wales,
and the evidence was completed by the efforts of the llev. A.
T. Fryer, of Cardiff. The account sent by Mr. Young was as follows:
LLANISHEN, CARDIFF, October 22nd, 1904.
The following narrative was communicated to me by Mrs. Page
of Caerphilly, a lady whose intelligence and high character render the
Die., 1904. Cases. 321
account, I venture to think, of special value. Mrs. Page is the inven
tor of a valuable ointment. A young man living in the district had
been in the habit of using this ointment for his chest. He, however,
was consumptive, and though he had great faith in the efficacy of
the ointment, it was evident it could be of no material use, and, indeed,
despite his doctor's care, he grew worse and worse. On the early
morning of the 21st December, 1903, about 3 o'clock a.m., Mrs. Page
was in bed, when she was awakened by steps coming up the stairs,
followed by sharp knocking at her bedroom door. This was also
heard by relatives sleeping in an adjoining room. She jumped up,
went to the door and out into the passage, but there was no one there.
In the course of the day she learnt that the young man had died at
the very time she heard the above. He was most eager to see Mrs.
Page, and had implicit faith in her remedy up to the last. This is the
real statement of fact, but Mrs. Page will gladly answer any ques
tion that may be put to her on the subject. I may add that she
is a strong woman mentally and physically, possessed- of abundance
of common-sense, and not in the least superstitious.
ARTHUR MEE,
(Assistant Editor Western Mail).
The above is perfectly true.
Nov. 5th, 1904. GKORGIANA PAGE.
Mr. Fryer, having kindly undertaken to inquire into the case,
wrote first to Mrs. Page, and received the following reply :
CAERPHILLY, Nov. 4lh, 1904.
. . . When I heard the three hard knocks at my bedroom door, it never
struck me that Daniel Morgan was dead, until I saw his sister-in-law
open my gate at 9 o'clock [the] same morning, when I turned quite
cold. Two of my daughters are from home until Monday, otherwise
they would write by this post for you. GEORGIANA PAGE.
Mr. Fryer then sent a series of questions to the widow of
the dead man. These are printed here with her replies :
Q. What was Mr. Morgan's full name and age ?
A. Daniel Morgan, age 42.
Q. At what time exactly did he die 1
A. 3 o'clock a.m., December 21st, 1903.
Q. What did he say about Mrs. Page before death ?
A. "Send for Mrs. Page for her to see me," this he asked con
stantly. She was so good and kind to him, and helped him to get
nourishment, and gave him as much ointment as he wanted. She
behaved like a lady for months.
322 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Die., 1904.
Q. How long before his death had he seen Mrs. Page? Either
at Caerphilly or Bedwas ?
A. Three weeks and at Caerphilly.
Q. Who took the message to Mrs. Page that Mr. Morgan was
dead, and at what time of day '.'
A. My sister ; at nine a.m.
Nov. 5th, 1904. ELIZA MORGAN.
Mr. Fryer also had an interview with Mrs. Page about the
case and was very favourably impressed by her as a witness.
She told him of another apparently veridical experience con
nected with the death of a relative ; but this had occurred
over twenty years ago, and no evidence of it seems to be
now obtainable. With regard to the case now in question,
Mrs. Page wrote further to Mr. Fryer :
CAERPHILLY, GLAM., Nov. 12th, 1904.
Three of my daughters heard the footsteps coming up the stairs
and going straight to my bedroom door, and knocking three times.
The eldest only .ventured out to see who was there, after hearing
me call. I got up, opened my door and could see no one, and
Miss Page remarked that it was a funny thing, and said " We will
hear of some friend's death after this, mother." We never gave
Mr. Morgan's death a thought until his sister-in-law came at nine
o'clock to tell us. Then we said in a moment it was his ghost.
GEORGIANA PAGE.
From the information contained in this letter, Mr. Fryer
wrote the two following statements, which were then signed
by Mrs. Page's daughters :
We, the undersigned, daughters of Mrs. Page, heard the footsteps
as of some one coming upstairs and then a knocking, three times,
at our mother's door. The time we ascertained was 3 a.m.
(Signed) HENRIETTA ADA PAGE.

Nov. nth, 1904. CHRISTINE PAGE.
I heard the footsteps as of some one coming upstairs and then
knocks, three times, at my mother's door. I went out to see who
was there, saw no one. I said to my mother " We shall hear of
some friend's death after this." The time I ascertained was 3
o'clock a.m., 21st December, 1903.

L. 1142. Impression.
The following case of possible telepathy from a dog was also sent
to us by Mr. J. F. Young, of New Road, Llanelly, South Wales.
NEW ROAD, LLANELLY, Nov. \Wi, 1904.
I own a rough terrier, about 5 years old, which I have brought
up from a pup. I have always been a great lover of animals, dogs
especially. This dog returns my affection so much that I never go
anywhere, not even leave the room, but he must follow me. He is
death on rats, and the scullery being visited occasionally by these
rodents, I have a comfortable bed for Fido to sleep on. In this room
there is a fire-place with an oven suitable for baking, and a boiler for
washing, with a flue running back into the chimney (as sketch) [not
reproduced here]. It was my custom to take him to his bed the last
thing before retiring for the night. I had undressed and was
about getting into bed, when an unaccountable feeling came over
me of impending danger. I could think of nothing possible but
Fire, and the impression was so strong that I yielded to it and
actually dressed again, and went downstairs and examined each
room to satisfy myself that all was right. When I got to the scul
lery I missed Fido, and thinking he had slipped by me unobserved
to go upstairs, I immediately began to call him, but getting no
response, I called to my sister-in-law to know if she had heard him,
and getting an answer in the negative, I began to feel excited, and
rushed back to the scullery again, and called repeatedly, but not a
sound could be heard. What to do I did not know. It then
occurred to me that if anything will get him to respond it will be
the sentence, " Come for a walk, Fido," which always gave him
delight. As soon as I had repeated this sentence, I heard a faint
cry, muffled as if distant ; calling again, the cry of a dog in dis
tress came plainly. I eventually traced it to the flue at * [a point
marked in the sketch], where the flue uniting the boiler with chim
ney runs. For the moment I could not think how I could get
him out; moments were precious, life was in danger. I took a
pickaxe and soon tore down a portion of the wall, when with some
difficulty I drew him out half-dead, panting, vomiting, tongue and
body black with soot ; my pet would soon have been dead, and as
the boiler is only used occasionally, I should never have known
what had become of him. Hearing the noise my sister-in-law came
to the scene. We found a rat-hole in the fireplace which led to
the flue. Fido had evidently chased the rat into the flue and could
not turn or retreat. . . . This occurred a few months ago and
was reported at the time in our local paper, but I never thought of
sending it to you until I read the Rider Haggard story.
J. F. YOUNG.
Mr. Young's sister-in-law writes :
The above is a correct account of the incident. E. BENNETT.
324 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1904.
Mr. Young tells us that his sister-in-law was the only person
besides himself in the house at the time and therefore the
only other possible witness. In reply to questions as to
the possibility of his having heard any sounds made by
the dog before he went downstairs, he writes :
November 19th, 1904.
. . . Re Dog. As suggested by you I will give you a few
more particulars relating to this. I think you will at once see
the utter impossibility of any sounds reaching me, unless they had
been very loud, and even then my sister-in-law, who sleeps nearer
the dog than I do, would have noticed it. In fact she enquired
as I was crossing the landing to go down, where I was going;
when I replied that "I felt as if something was going to happen,
and feared it might be fire." I may here remark that as I passed
from room to room, I began to accuse myself for being so silly
as to imagine any danger. However, I went on looking for some
thing, not having the slightest idea of what to expect. From that
time, until I read Rider Haggard's dream, I put it down to an
intelligence outside myself that had prompted me to go down.
The telepathic theory now takes its place, especially taking into
consideration the devotion of the dog, for, if possible, he will not
allow me out of his sight, and in my absence is quite a different dog. . . .
In reply to query (1), Yes. I took him, as I always do, to
his bed the last thing [before going] the round of the rooms and
doors to see that all is safe. I (2) also enclose a sketch, in section,
which will give you an idea as to our positions. (3) I never
heard any sounds, and neither could I get any after repeated
whistling and calling, until I called him to go for a walk, and that
was so faint I could not at first localise it. You will observe
the position of the dog was actually the furthest [from me] that
could be in the house. ... J. F. YOUNG.
In this letter and a later one, Mr. Young enclosed rough plans
of his house, showing his bedroom at the front, and on the
opposite side of the house from the scullery, which is at the
back. The bedroom is on the first floor and the scullery
in the basement, the ground floor intervening between them.
There were also three doors, all shut and locked, between
the interiors of the two rooms, namely, the doors of the rooms
themselves and a third door at the top of the lowest flight
of stairs leading down to the basement. Under these circum
stances, it is very difficult to suppose that Mr. Young could
have heard any sounds from the dog imprisoned in the .flue.

HYPNOTISM :
ITS HISTORY, PRACTICE, AND THEORY.
BT J. MILNE BRAMWELL, M.B., C.M.
8»o. 478 pages. 18s. net.
The chief aim of this monograph is to draw the attention of medical men
to the therapeutic value of Hypnotism. The author gives the results of
twelve years of his own practice and research, with personal observations
of the work done in France, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, and
Belgium.
The historical part of the book is specially devoted to the comparatively
little known work of the English pioneers, Elliotson, Esdaile, and Braid,
•while the final chapter of references contains much information which has
not hitherto been published in accessible form.
The methods of inducing Hypnotism are exhaustively dealt with and
instructions given in regard to the management of the hypnotic state, with
details as to the causes of susceptibility to hypnosis. Hypnotic theories are
described and discussed, and special prominence is given to Mr. Myers's
theory of the subliminal consciousness and the light thrown by it on the
problems of hypnotism.
