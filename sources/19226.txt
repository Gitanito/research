yeah great question about crop circles
and by the way just hold Colin Andrews
and your thoughts and prayers I got an
email late last night that he is in
critical condition as at Yale University
Hospital with the type of heart
condition and he is in really critical
condition he&#39;s the premier crop circle
researcher he&#39;s a really good friend
since 92 91 so you know I was shocked to
hear this last night but I would say
that you know the majority of crop
circles at this point are hoaxed however
the ones that have been authentic are
really amazing the problem is sifting
out the noise from the sound it&#39;s just
like UFOs you know what part of its
man-made and disinformation and hoaxed
and what part of it is real but my own
sense of it is that it&#39;s certainly a way
that they&#39;re trying to visually convey
almost archetype knowledge of symbols
and shapes and if you will sacred
geometry through a very visual medium
transdimensional II and the way I think
they&#39;re created because we interviewed
Colin Andrews and I interviewed a farmer
believer is not his name was mr. bull
it&#39;s like you can&#39;t make that up either
at near Alton barns and he had been out
on his farm in day time and there had
been a crop circle that had formed and
then he was there when this energy field
just came out of the sky and it was like
a dark it was like a mobile black hole
and it came down and all of a sudden
everything started swirling and moving
and bending down around it and what I
figured out by studying the real crop
circles and you know the see City logo
is a crop circle that we communicated
visually to the ETS that they put into a
field in 1992 and that whole story is
fascinating
but what I figured out is that they what
they&#39;re doing is that they&#39;re augmenting
or increasing the gravitational field
over a certain area over with a template
if you will like a cut as like a
blueprint electromagnetic blueprint that
thing goes and lays this down very
quickly now the ones that are hoaxes are
just smush now but these are very
fascinating and the and so if you can
imagine creating a counter-rotating
electromagnetic field that causes
levitation which is what anti-gravity is
in a certain resonant frequency using
crystalline materials and nano
crystalline materials we know exactly
how this works but then reverse that
you&#39;re increasing the gravitational
field so you can have an object way out
in space and it kind of targets an area
very specifically and can create this
energy field that then pulls the crop
down instead of lifting it up but in a
very specific pattern it goes very
quickly and that&#39;s how we figured out
how they&#39;re making it how they&#39;re making
the authentic crop circles yes yes I&#39;ve
heard of them we&#39;ve corresponded and
we&#39;ve asked for you know evidence of
proof of principle operation and never
gotten anything so we&#39;re still waiting
to see if they have anything it&#39;s easy
to make a claim our requirement as you
know for these energy technologies is
transparent conveyance of them to us
with transparent testing but more
importantly third party creation of the
effect which is to send up on known of
science if it&#39;s not reproducible that&#39;s
not science it has to be reproducible
and so that&#39;s what we&#39;ve asked for but
we haven&#39;t gotten anything in response
yet so yes sir you spoke about how
difficult it would be for a craft to
down without getting shut down there&#39;s
so many things in place that Sena didn&#39;t
show up somebody&#39;s there right away
these are questions yeah oh yes so he&#39;s
asking about you know this whole issue
of when you&#39;re you know setting up a
ce-5 or wanting to invite ETS to come
into an area well you know what kind of
things might interfere and the problem
is is that in the last sixty years we&#39;ve
gone from or 70 years since Roswell
we&#39;ve gone from fairly primitive
electromagnetic targeting to very
sophisticated ones that are based
space-based and on and on aircraft and
these have been used now we were at
Mount Shasta a few years ago when we
were doing ce-5 and there was this
really not fully materialized craft it
was like a sphere of pure white energy
light visible everyone saw the 30 people
30 40 people and it was floating towards
us out of Mount Shasta about 12,000 feet
elevation and we were at about 7,000 so
probably about 5,000 AGL above ground
level and it was coming towards us and
there was a very high altitude it seemed
like it was a 747 especially equipped
and a burst of energy came out of this
aircraft and at that instant this
partially in this dimension craft
vanished and this energy field it was
invisible but came in about 200 yards in
front of us into the woods and crashed
through the woods ripping the tree limbs
off in the trees and actually impacted
the earth and went boom and in mobile
owned it for 15 seconds shook the earth
and I thought all of we were expecting
to see a mushroom cloud nothing it was
just an inner a directed-energy weapon
and I that was one of the few times
where I was really scared for my group
and I thought my god were all
get killed and everyone there saw this
and that that&#39;s when you know a few
things like that happened and that&#39;s why
one of our protocols has always let the
ETS know don&#39;t do anything too risky
because we don&#39;t want you or us to get
caught in the crossfire this is why we
initially started these these briefings
with the military to ask that we have
them deconflict their operations with
ours but they didn&#39;t listen because the
operations that want to interfere now
why would that happen
they don&#39;t want ce-5 events to go so far
that it results in a massive open
dispositive event that can&#39;t be
ambiguous and that&#39;s why it tends to be
quick strange now can that change yes
perhaps with people who&#39;ve asked me why
don&#39;t you go to the Amazon or ice I
don&#39;t think it matters because this
weapons systems I&#39;ve been briefed on our
geospatial there can be moved and there
can be on what it look like satellites
though or aircraft that can be anywhere
in the world so I don&#39;t I think that
it&#39;s that&#39;s why as the head of this I
mean there are thousands of people doing
the c-5 initiative I always tell people
the biggest liability is if I&#39;m there so
do it without me because they can&#39;t they
don&#39;t have enough assets to keep track
of thousands of teams but they can keep
track of where I am
so but when this happened it made me
realize that they had some new things
that were quite amazing but luckily this
particular ET object wasn&#39;t fully in
this dimension it&#39;s almost like a plasma
energy that was floating towards us from
way up in Mount Shasta came out of the
mountain and we have to actually some
great videotapes of those objects coming
out of the Mount but this one was
actually coming towards us when this
object fired and so that&#39;s why I always
ask the ETS you know come but don&#39;t do
anything that is too risky for you or us
do it only if it&#39;s safe and appropriate
for this time in place and you know
I don&#39;t think that this is a huge
problem for local contact teams that
have four or five people scattered
around because I mean this group is
large but it&#39;s not omniscient and
omnipresent but when I&#39;m doing something
and it&#39;s obviously been announced and
we&#39;re there with a whole group of
trainees it&#39;s certainly going to be
monitored so that&#39;s why I tell people
that it&#39;s great as a training event we
have amazing sightings and events happen
but I mean the good news is I&#39;m there
the bad news is I&#39;m there
I mean being quite honest with you yes
sir and how would you the contacts that
you have the communications that you
have how would you characterize them do
they break down into do you communicate
about the same things or the same
general things each time or is it just
all over the place he&#39;s asking you know
how the communications kind of break
down into different types of
communications and information it
actually is different with every group
and every time we go out there&#39;s
something new that happens I&#39;ve never
seen and I&#39;ve been doing this for 25
years so if you read the book
extraterrestrial contact at rent account
down transformation what you&#39;ll see in
that book is that there are literally
thousands of different phenomenon that
happen and have happened over the years
and it runs the gamut to fully
materialized objects that appear right
over us and people getting remote viewed
information consciously - we were
sitting one time out in Orange County
and sitting right in front of all of us
I was doing just a weekend thing there
was a voice that bloated start talking
right in front of us in thin air either
a consistent
it depends on the group and there is the
message obviously is that they&#39;re very
happy we&#39;re doing this and it&#39;s always a
welcoming sort of a feeling but
sometimes there is very specific
information and they it just depends on
the setting when this et I called Bisou
who appeared at Joshua Tree the one that
looks like this
luminous figure floating outside the
circle it was a very specific welcome
from a group of people now the way that
priest was preceded was that we were in
our circle up in the Joshua Tree
National Park and we were at a break and
I&#39;d walked out east of the circle out
into the desert and I was with a group
of people on my team and suddenly there
was like a sphere that fully
materialized right beside me and walked
with me and I said oh they&#39;re here so we
went back to the group to get people
back together they&#39;re all scattered is
3040 people in the desert and it&#39;s pitch
black
then all of a sudden we hear a group of
four or five ETS talking and they&#39;re
outside the circle to the southeast and
we could hear mostly it sounded like
female voices except for one heard of
male voice and by the way almost
everyone heard this and well I have
these really good night-vision
binoculars like generations advanced and
there was nothing there were you these
you heard these people talking so I
turned everyone I said we need to get
back together in coherence and sit down
and I asked someone to take a picture so
Raven a member of my team was just
holding her breath but she didn&#39;t have a
tripod and took a picture three or four
second exposure and in it is this being
floating right outside our circle turned
and waving is not photoshopped that is
the single most important picture in the
history of the UFO subject because it
was a ce-5 diplomatic initiative that
ended up having photographic proof of it
our contact team
so it&#39;s been roundly missed by most
people it is the single most important
piece of evidence in the last hundred
years that I know of so anyway it was
beautiful and then we went into this
meditative state there were all kinds of
information that we started getting all
our electronic we have these
magnetometers magnetic field meters and
radar detectors and other high-tech
stuff all started talking and it went on
for about two hours it was amazing and
so figuring out what they&#39;re actually
communicating is an art of it someone
say is a telepathic I said oh it&#39;s
sensing so you go into a deep state and
you can actually get specific
information about where they&#39;re from why
they&#39;re there but it have it&#39;s very
different each time you know we&#39;re gonna
be up in Joshua Tree in a couple weeks
and then in the Rocky Mountains in June
and we may do something in Portugal you
know this fall and some other things
this summer I don&#39;t know but I&#39;d like to
go to Portugal and do it we&#39;ll see we&#39;re
looking for a good place to do it
but yeah it&#39;s a beautiful experience and
what I tell people is that you know it&#39;s
almost universally the word they&#39;re
wanting to do sort of a cultural
exchange they&#39;re wanting to see how you
are and then a lot of times they will
show you visually their planet or their
houses or their culture it&#39;s it&#39;s really
quite beautiful people who have never
had experiences like that will have
these breakthrough events and it just
blows their minds the other thing is
that sound can also be seen at a certain
resonant frequency so one time we were
up at Mount Shasta a different time and
we were sitting in the National Forest
and there was a tone that came out of it
was a multi-directional tone that just
emerged out of the air and everyone we
were in our meditative state and
everyone saw what looked like a gunmetal
gray or pearl ash gray sphere that moved
through the circle like a string of
pearls just so the sound created the
form which is very Vedic if you
understand the Vedas name-and-form sound
and form and
that was definitely et and it was
astonishing because almost everyone
sitting there heard and saw in their
visual image the same object move
through beautiful
