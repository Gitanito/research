It felt like my stomach had exploded. The next thing I knew when I woke up, I was in an ambulance. I was rushed into surgery. While I was in recovery, my parents said everything went OK. As I sat up a little to talk to them, everything burst wide open again. I was rushed into emergency surgery again. 

As I was being operated on, I remember looking down at the surgeons working on me. I tried to tell my parents everything was OK. After a few seconds or minutes, I felt a warm, glowing light; it felt so warm and so good. I met a person who said she would take care of me. I asked, 'Who are you?' Her reply was, 'I am your grandmother's mother.' I had never met this person. After a few seconds or minutes, I told her I was starting to get cold. Her reply was, 'You will need to go back now.' I did not want to go back. She said, 'You must; it is not time yet.'  

The next thing I remember was waking up in the recovery room with my parents.

    Experience Description 7426  					</p>  					I had burst my appendix and was rushed to a hospital; the surgery went fine. As I was recovering, I felt a sharp pain in my stomach.  Apparently, the sutures in my stomach failed and burst open. I was in emergency surgery when my experience began.  

I distinctly remember floating over my body because I could look down and see the doctors working on me. I also remember going to the waiting room to try to tell my parents everything would be okay.  At this point, I felt a feeling of warmth and great contentment.  The warmer I became, the closer I was drawn to a glowing white warm light. I was very young at this time. 

As I floated higher and higher, I was met by an elderly woman whom I had never seen before. She told me she was here to take care of me. I asked, 'Who are you?' Her reply was, 'I am your grandmother's mother and I was sent to take care of you.'  We spoke for a while.  The warmth I had been feeling started to become cool. I said, 'It is getting colder.' She said 'That is a sign you are not ready to come yet, you must go back.' I felt like I did not want to go back and tried fighting the return. She said, 'You must return. I will see you later; I will always be waiting to take care of you.' 

That is all I remember until I woke in in my hospital bed.
