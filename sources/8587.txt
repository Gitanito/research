Please consider  participating in the first Internet based study organized within the gay  community.&nbsp;  There are many important lessons to be learned from  understanding Near Death Experience (NDE).

'A  lucid experience associated with perceived consciousness apart from the body  occurring at the time of actual or threatened death'.

With  your advance permission (from the Internet form) we would be happy to E-mail  back your submission, with all questions on the Internet form and your  responses.&nbsp;  You may then share your  experience submission in written form with anyone you wish.&nbsp;   We regret there can be no other compensation for participation in this  study.&nbsp;  Results of this study will  be periodically published (anonymously) to this web site (a non-profit web  site).&nbsp;  Thank you in advance  for your willingness to participate in this important study!
