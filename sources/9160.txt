  					 After gall-bladder surgery, I was in poor shape. I remained half-conscious after a heart attack that occurred while I was in the recovery room. I made a breath-taking dive into a tunnel. I saw motionless people. I saw old colleagues (deceased for many years), making signs as if to say, “Come along with us”. I saw my parents (deceased since 1979), making signs, inviting me to follow them. I also saw my mother-in-law making signs in order to stop me from following the others that were making these signs. I was still diving faster and faster and deeper and deeper toward a bluish-white light that was attracting me.


For how long? No idea. At one point, I thought I was flying. Under me: a bed with a form, instruments, and people with yellow faces that were dressed in green. All around the bed were devices to which the form on the bed was linked. I was hearing voices and wanted to answer but not a sound would came out of my mouth. And the dive was continuing, always toward this light.


At one point, I was seeing people between the light and me: my wife, my two daughters and their husbands, and in the middle of them, surrounded by a soft light I was seeing my granddaughter (who is two years old). She was moving her head and saying, “No Grandfather”. After that, everything dissolved into the light.
