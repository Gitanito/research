            		Experience Description:   

I was in a rubber dingy, my mother was pulling me. I was with a friend. The friend had a life jacket on. I did not. The dingy tipped in the middle of the lake.

I remember looking down at myself going in the water. A bright light surrounded me. I was watching myself drown from somewhere high above. I could see my arms flailing, air bubbles come out of my mouth, I saw the vivid color of my swimsuit, and I was watching all of this, feeling quite dispassionate. I was not afraid, curious, sad, or anything. Dispassionate described it best.

The next thing I knew my mother had grabbed me around the waist and she managed to get me to the surface. As far as I can recall there weren't any ill after effects.
