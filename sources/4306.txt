    Summary: &nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Public Circle, The.
 A Record of Facts in Spiritual Intercourse.
 1855-1856  Monthly
 New York, NY.  Publisher: R.W. Heurtley.  Editor: Michael A. Curran.  Succeeded by: The Principle (?)
 1/1, March 1855-February 1856(?)  $1.00 a year.

This probably lasted into the fall of 1856, and is variously described as a journal or a pamphlet.  The Spiritual Telegraph for December 20, 1856, in noticing the new The Principle, says: “We suppose it is designed to take the place of the Public Circle . . . ."  The advertisement for the journal in the Christian Spiritualist in September 1855 says it was to contain “a record of facts in Spiritual Intercourse, chiefly derived from Circles held by J.B. Conklin, Medium.”  The journal’s purpose was stated to be to bring in sufficient income “to provide means whereby [Conklin] may give the greater part of his time to FREE PUBLIC CIRCLES for the benefit of the needy and afflicted.” Stanford University.
