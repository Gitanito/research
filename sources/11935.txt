  		              		Experience Description   

    I had taken a new job in Michigan. I was  living in an apartment Monday through Friday and returning home to Indiana on the weekends. We were planning on moving the family during the school break the next month in January.

   One night at the apartment, I was having chest pains and went to the emergency room at the local hospital. The nurse hooked me up to an EKG machine and had me sit on a gurney while she explained what was happening on the monitor. As we were watching, the line on the monitor  flat-lined. As I fell back on the bed, I remember that it was painless. 

   I felt very relaxed and peaceful. Everything was black and I had the feeling of being in a tunnel. Way off, in the distance at the end of the tunnel, I could see a bright light. 

  Before I reached the light,  I  regained consciousness  to see  half dozen Doctors and Nurses hovering over me. One of them was pounding on my chest and another was holding zappers over me. The next day, I asked the Doctor how long I had gone without a heart beat. He said, 'About a minute.'
