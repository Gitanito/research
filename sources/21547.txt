PSYCHIC EVOLUTION
OR some years now the idea that the human race is on the
Fverge, even in the midst, of a great change, has been gaining
popular currency. This theory is by no means limited to politi
cal prophets and workers for an international order. Nearly every
branch of thought has its version of the world of tomorrow. While
sober scientists are predicting that specialized progress will revolu
tionize still further our present ways of life, there are scores of exotic
cults which anticipate more miraculous alterations in the future, and
are now attempting to gather supporters for their particular program
of social reform. It is as though the whole world were in labor,
utterly confused as to the meaning of the physical and moral suffer
ing of all humanity, and longing, with the intensity born of despera
tion, to believe that, somehow, the millennium is not far off.
The scientiﬁc and other serious literature of the age is full of de
scriptions of this unrest, but little or no explanation is offered—at
least, no explanation that is at all adequate to the great psychological
upheaval before us. The fact of change is readily acknowledged,
but its meaning remains obscure. It is for this reason that the ancient
Theosophical view of human evolution is here presented.
N0 special claim to authority is made for the doctrines that will
be offered in explanation of the emotional turmoil we are experienc
ing. Theosophy is not made public as a “revelation,” nor is mere
“belief” in these teachings solicited. It claims consideration on the
ground of inherent reasonableness, and its clear application to the
facts as they may be observed by anyone. If it be taken only as a
“working hypothesis,” much can be gained from an impartial study
of Theosophical teaching, and consistent judgment and comparison
of these doctrines with all other views of life is sure to result in a
just appreciation of the great contribution of the Teachers of The
osophy to the modern world.
Naturally, little more than “intimations” of the scope of the The
osophical philosophy can be presented in the compass of these few
pages. However, should the suggestions here provided arouse the
inquirer to pursue his studies further, he will ﬁnd in the basic texts
of the philosophy a ﬁeld of research that will challenge his highest
faculties and reward even the most extravagant hopes.

2 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
The great scientiﬁc discovery of the nineteenth century was the
Law of Evolution. It was not a really “new” idea, but one well
known to the Teachers of antiquity, of both India and Greece, and
rather than discovered, was “revived” in a new form. Few
men of the West are aware that the original of this modern doctrine
may be found in so ancient a scripture as the Laws of Manu. There
is,
however,
a
vitally important difference between ancient and mod
ern theories of evolution.
As everyone knows, the Darwinian Theory, which may be taken
to represent the scientiﬁc view of evolution, was developed to explain
the many changes
in
form which various species of plants and ani
mals have undergone through millions of years
in
the past. Darwin
studied the changes and evolution
in
bodies, as though no other kind
of progress were possible, and all the scientists who have since added
facts and theories to our understanding of evolution followed his
example. The result has been that we think of evolution as simply
a
physical process,
in
which the powers developed are physical,
wholly
a
product of the growth and perfection of animal bodies.
But there
is
another kind of evolution than that common to the
lower kingdoms of nature—an evolution peculiar to man, which
is
intellectual and moral. The lines of physical, intellectual and moral
evolution are all three present in human beings, and
it
is
possible to
distinguish between them and to realize how essentially diﬁerent
they are, one from the other. A man may have an excellent body,
yet be intellectually weak; and the same man may have either
a
good or
a
bad moral nature. A wise man may live
in
a
puny, dis
eased body, using his understanding to overcome the limitations of
his physical organism. In the same way, remarkable mental powers
may be joined to moral goodness,
in
which case we have
a
sage; or
intellectual ability may be the servant of calculating selﬁshness
in
another man, with quite different results for his fellow human beings.
All
in
all, taking men as we ﬁnd them
in
our own experience,
it
should
be plain that they differ one from another far more
in
these psychic
qualities than
in
any distinctions of body, and that the true evolu
tion of mankind lies
in
the further development of their mental and
moral powers.
This view of evolution takes our inquiry into
a
sphere of experience
and study that
is
quite unfamiliar to western thought. The whole
question of “the psychic" and abnormal powers and phenomena has
for several centuries been almost entirely neglected by the scholars
and scientists of European and American civilization. Not until the

past twenty years or so has there been any real willingness on the
part of the leaders of western thought to admit even the possibility
that soul- or mind-powers may exist and act independently of the
physical body and the laws of external nature. And even now, with
the most forceful evidence of powers of a psychic character before
them—telepathy, clairvoyance, and even pre-vision are now gener
ally accepted by impartial investigators—our scientists are for the
most part still reluctant to consider that there may be laws of mind
and soul action which should be studied as principles distinct in them
selves, not dependent on the laws known to physicists and biologists.
The facts are plain, and are increasing with each year of research.
Ultimately, in the course of this century, they will be recognized as
realities, and an attempt will have to be made to explain them, even
if this requires complete revision of all our western theories of life
and evolution. It was in anticipation of this general trend in modern
thought—indicative of the next great step in human evolution—that
the Third Object of the Theosophical Society was stated as:
The investigation of the unexplained laws of nature and the
psychical powers latent in man.
Suggestion has been given of what some of the “psychical powers
latent in man” may be, but what about “unexplained” laws of nature?
The admirer of modern science asks quite naturally, Are not the laws
of nature themselves the explanations? As a matter of fact, they
are not. Lest there be misunderstanding on this score, a passage on
the law of “Gravitation” may be quoted from a recent scientiﬁc Writer:
Just because the effects of gravitation are so familiar and because
Newton’s law accounts so completely for the motions of the heav
enly bodies, except for a few minute effects which Einstein's theory
represents better than Newton’s, we are apt to forget how mysterious
gravitation is and how little our so-called explanations penetrate the
mystery. . . . Our so-called physical explanations are almost always
mere descriptions of one sort or another.‘
H
Newton himself made no pretense of being able to “explain the
cause of gravitation, and said so quite frankly, and it has remained
a mystery from that day to this. Thus there was every reason in
the world for Theosophy to propose another approach to the great
questions of the laws of nature and the powers in man. The method
of physical science had, it is true, given us much practical knowledge
concerning the use of the forces of nature, enabling western nations

to raise a great civilization upon this foundation, but the meaning of
life remained a secret that Science could not discover, and it is now
evident to all thoughtful persons that the real meaning and purpose
of existence is by far the most important thing for human beings to
investigate. The teachings of Theosophy are in the world to meet
this need.
Man has now reached a point where he is beginning to in-quire
what more there is for him to know. He has ceased to think exclu
sively of the material side of life; he is sensing his own nature, feel
ing within the slow awakening of powers long hidden and asleep,
and he asks: What am I, whence came I, whither do I go?
There is no possible way of understanding or explaining the an
swers to these questions except through Evolution, and for Man
this is evolution of the Soul. Man is a spiritual being, and his evolu
tion is an unfolding from within outward, the expression of spirit
or consciousness through the intelligence he has acquired by experi
ence. dll evolution involves the growth of intelligence through ex
perience, and the consequent further expression of the powers of
Spirit, but in man is manifested a type of intelligence that is higher
than that seen in the lower kingdoms of nature.
The development of intelligence proceeds very slowly in the
mineral and vegetable kingdoms, more rapidly in the animal kingdom.
Evolution in these three kingdoms is represented by changes in physi
cal form, by adaptation to external conditions and the elaboration of
organs for specialized functions. Human evolution is of another
sort. Man is not simply concerned with states and conditions of
matter; the evolution of intelligence in him has reached that stage
where the being himself knows that he
is,
that he
is
conscious, that
he can understand to some extent his own nature and the natures
of the beings below him, and recognize the interrelation of all.
Two-thirds of
a
century ago, H. P. Blavatsky wrote on the open
ing page of Isis Unveiled:
Is
it
too much to believe that man should be developing new sensi
bilities and
a
closer relation with nature? The logic of evolution
must teach as much,
if
carried to its legitimate conclusions. If,
somewhere, in the line of ascent from vegetable or ascidian to the
noblest man
a
soul was evolved, gifted with intellectual qualities,
it
cannot be unreasonable to infer and believe that
a
faculty of per
ception
is
also growing in man, enabling him to descry facts and
truths even beyond our ordinary ken. We believe in no Magic

in “miracle,” whether divine or diabolical, if such imply a trans
gression of the laws of nature instituted from all eternity. Never
theless, we accept the saying of the gifted author of Festus, that the
human heart has not yet fully uttered itself, and that we have never
attained or even understood the extent of its powers.
The two large volumes of this work are devoted to a demonstra
tion of the hidden powers in man and to an exposition of the philos
ophy of evolution which alone can explain their presence. All past
history is the author’s witness, brought upon the stand of impartial
inquiry and made to show that there have been literally thousands
of men and women in whom the powers of soul have ﬂowered more
fully than in ordinary persons, whose lives gave evidence of the
course of evolution of the race as a whole in the future.
It was not Madame Blavatsky’s purpose to arouse a mere curiosity
about the wonderful, to raise up a generation of seekers after powers
by which the world might be amazed and even enslaved. On the con
trary, she desired only that men might grow into realization of their
own potentialities as spiritual beings, naturally, with an appreciation
of the enormous responsibilities which the possession of such powers
places upon their user. She knew that in the course of the present
cycle there was destined to be a vast unfoldment of the subtler
faculties of perception in the human race; that powers hitherto the
endowment of only the seer and the sensitive would tend to become
more common, until ﬁnally, to be without them would be a mark of
atavism and retrogression.
Clearly, so complete a development of psychic powers among
humanity at large will occupy many hundreds, or rather, thousands
of years. In the scheme of evolution offered in the Theosophical
philosophy, human and all other progress proceeds in accordance
with great cycles, some of them lasting through almost incalculable
periods of time, during which the hosts of human souls involved
in this great period of manifestation return again and again to
earth, according to the law of Reincarnation. By this process the
collective experience in the school of life is carried on, each cycle
of incarnation bringing the soul into contact with new relations of
matter and intelligence, thus awakening to action in the beings the
powers and faculties potential in that cycle. The end of all this
learning is the progressive spiritualization of mankind, through a
growing realization of universal brotherhood, and the achievement
of conscious divinity for each human soul by the natural develop
ment of the powers common to all.

PSYCHISM
is a term used in Theosophical literature to de
The psychic or soul nature of man has powers of its own, which
may be studied in relation to the physical organism. The coordinated
functioning of psychic and physical powers results in the familiar
processes of waking life—perception, feeling, thinking, remembering,
imagining and willing. Modern psychology has studied these pro
cesses with such devotion, and on the assumption that the soul or ego
has no powers of its own separate from the body, that the edu
cated person of today knows little or nothing of the higher psychology
of the spiritual man, and is even ignorant of the subtle forces which
have their play in the lower psychic or astral man. Hence the
mysteries with which present study of psychic phenomena is sur
rounded. It is safe to say that not one of the modern investigators
of the psychic world, scientist or some other, has perfected his con
trol of the inner faculties and powers with which every man is en
dowed, so that he may exercise them independently of the body, or,
at least, free of the illusions of sense perception. How, then, can there
be knowledge of these things, without the control which is the pre
requisite to knowledge in every branch of science?
Mediumship is the abnormal manifestation of psychic powers, and
is generally the result of disease of some sort, or prolonged psycho
logical malpractice. The few determined individuals who have de
veloped themselves to the point where these powers are obedient
servants of the human will, have been known through history as
adapts. As Madame Blavatsky has written:
The exercise of magical power is the exercise of powers natural,
but superior to the ordinary functions of Nature. A miracle is not a
violation of the laws of Nature, except for ignorant people. Magic
is but a science, a profound knowledge of the Occult forces in Nature,
and of the laws governing the visible or the invisible world. Spiritual
ism in the hands of an Adept becomes Magic, for he is learned in
the art of blending together the laws of the universe, without break
ing any of them and thereby violating Nature. In the hands of an

experienced medium, Spiritualism becomes unconscious sorcery; for,
by allowing himself to become the helpless tool of a variety of
spirits, of whom he knows nothing save what the latter permit him
to know, he opens, unknown to himself, a door of communication
between the two worlds, through which emerge the blind forces of
nature lurking in the astral light, as well as good and bad spirits.
To doubt magic is to reject History itself, as well as the testimony
of ocular witnesses thereof, during a period embracing over 4,000
years, beginning with Homer, Moses, Hermes, Herodotus, Cicero,
Plutarch, Pythagoras, Apollonius of Tyana, Simon the Magician,
Plato, Pausanias, Iamblichus, and following this endless string of great
men-—historians and philosophers, who all of them either believed
in Magic or were magicians themselves—and ending with our modern
authors such as W. Howitt, Ennemoser, G. des Mousseaux, Marquis
de Mirville and the late Eliphas Levi, who was a magician himself.
Madame Blavatsky reveals the ridiculous character of the claims
of spiritualists that such sages and great teachers were “mediums”
Fancy Christ, Moses, or an Apollonius of Tyana, controlled
by an Indian guide! Spiritual mediums were better known in those
days to the ancients, than they are now to us. The inspired sibyls,
pythonesses, and other mediums were entirely guided by their high
priest and those who were initiated into the esoteric theurgy and
mysteries of the temples. Theurgy was Magic; as in modern times,
the sibyls and pythonesses were mediums; but their high priests were
magicians. That is the reason why no trash was allowed to be given
by unprogressed spirits iii the days of old. The oracles of the sibyls
and inspired priestesses could never have affirmed Athens to be a town
in India, or jumped Mount Ararat from its native place down to
Egypt.
At the same time, the ancients had their illegal mediums—those
who belonged to no special temple—and thus the spirits controlling
them, unchecked by the expert hand of the magician, were left to
themselves, and had all the opportunity to perform their capers on
their helpless tools. Such mediums were generally considered ob
sessed and possessed, which they were in fact. According to Bible
phraseology, these mediums were ordered to be put to death, for the
intolerant Moses, the magician, who was learned in the wisdom of
Egypt, had said, “Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.” Alone
the Egyptians and the Greeks, even more humane and just than
Moses, took such into their temples, and, when found unﬁt for the
sacred duties of prophecy, cured them in the same Way as Jesus Christ
cured Mary of Magdala and many others.
Thus Magic exists, and has existed, ever since prehistoric ages.

course uninterruptedly, and ended for a time with the expiring
theurgic rites and ceremonies of Christianized Greece; then reap
peared for a time again with the Neoplatonic, Alexandrian school,
and, passing by initiation to sundry solitary students and philoso
phers, safely crossed the medieval ages, and notwithstanding the
furious persecutions of the Church, resumed its fame in the hands
of such Adepts as Paracelsus and several others, and ﬁnally died
out in Europe with the Count St. Germain and Cagliostro, to seek
refuge from frozen-hearted scepticism in its native country of the
East.
While knowledge of the laws governing psychic phenomena was
lost to the western world with the rise of Christianity, the phenomena
themselves did not cease occurring. From biblical days until the pres
ent, religious history is full of accounts of psychic inspiration. The
crudely emotional “speaking in tongues” is with us yet, and just as the
ancient Jews were guided by prophecy, so there are today Christian
sects who turn for guidance to the vaticinations of a select few of
the sensitives among their members. The visions and visitations ex
perienced by so many of the Christian Fathers were especially psych
ic. The demonology of the Dark Ages, the witch-hunting and heretic
baiting for hundreds of years by “Christian” priests, the periodic out
breaks of wild enthusiasm for this, that or the other practice or belief
-—these are the evidences of psychism through western history. When
the manifestations have been associated with genuine religious devo
tion, and personal purity, then a kind of spiritual vision, a higher
psychism, reveals itself in the clairvoyant perception and unmistakable
prophetic power which develop in sensitive individuals. But psychism
in company with evil ways and low habits of thought always leads to
unspeakable moral degradation. The fate of mediums who employ
their unnatural gifts for pay is sufficient evidence of this. The barter
ing of psychic powers for material gain is a kind of prostitution that
Nature ﬁnds intolerable, and the price paid by the medium for his
weakness is often the loss of personal immortality.
The lives of the saints of the Catholic Church are an almost unin
terrupted history of psychic phenomena. Unquestioning faith in the
reality of the other world, coupled with child-like belief in Christian
dogmas, brought intense psychic experiences to thousands of loyal
Christians. As the historian, Ennemoser, relates:
Visions were most frequent in convents, where solitude, ascetic
practices, fasting, uncared-for diseases, as spasmodic convulsions, the
unoccupied, often dreaming and overflowing imagination, gave
numerous opportunities for the formation of these objective pictures.

is scarcely more than a history of magnetism and a universal system
of so-called witchcraft and magic. Visions were so common that
rules were given to distinguish those of divine origin from false de
lusions and the temptations of the devil.
Many of the “witches” burned at the stake by the Church were
simple psychics, mediums, who knew only that they suffered inward
experiences that they could not understand and could not control. In
other cases, these manifestations took the form of what the sensitive
imagined to be divine inspiration, leading to a life of consecration in
the service of this spiritual guidance. ]oan of Arc was such a pure
psychic, suffering the usual fate of the reformer who dares to op
pose the “spiritual” monopoly of established religion. It is charac
teristic of every psychic vision that the medium sees the apparition,
or hears voices, which seem to conﬁrm or elaborate upon the beliefs
of the medium himself. Thus even the great Swedenborg, whose
visions startled all Europe, and whose clairvoyant report of the
Stockholm ﬁre convinced even Emmanuel Kant of the existence of
this power, was subject to misconception and error. The invisible
world of psychic perception is as diverse in its aspects as the physical
one, and inﬁnitely more difficult to understand. Thus Swedenborg,
claiming to have met the inhabitants of Mercury in the spirit-world,
described them as being dressed in clothes such as were worn in
Europe at that time. No psychic ever sees quite correctly, however
remarkable may be the approximations of his sight.
II
There are laws of psychic perception taught by Theosophy, some
of which may be stated as follows:
Thought passes to and fro from man to man. At a higher
level it does the same from higher intelligences to man, and all in a
sphere beyond the material. Men, from different causes, rising to
different levels above their ordinary outer selves, come into the
psychic plane where all is spread out before them. They see and read
only that for which they are ﬁtted, and comprehend only that for
which they are prepared. Through conscious or unconscious exalta
tion they rise into or come in contact with some current of thought or
unspoken word which enters their brains by divers roads. Compre
hended partly, perhaps, but being entirely foreign to their normal
personal manner of thinking,—knowing they have heard a voice—
it is ascribed to a Spirit, although in fact it may be the thought of a
living man they hear, feel, see or are repeating. All men who by
effort or training lift themselves consciously, or are lifted uncon

sciously above the material, secure the wisdom, knowledge and in
spiration of other planes. How much they understand of these
visions will depend upon their knowledge of occult philosophy.
Clairvoyant perception, unless supported by philosophical per
spective, is absolutely unreliable. Clairvoyants have on innumerable
occasions given correct descriptions of events and persons they could
never have known or seen, but other innumerable times they have
failed. If it were not always a matter of doubt and difficulty, natural
clear-seers would have long ago demonstrated the unerring range
of their vision by discovering uncaught criminals, by pointing out
where stolen property could be recovered, by putting a ﬁnger on a
moral plague-spot which is known to exist but cannot be located.
Yet this they have not done, and theosophists are conﬁrmed in the
old teaching that the ﬁeld of clairvoyance is full of delusions.
The prime cause for delusion is that the thought of anything makes
around the thinker an image of the thing thought about. And all
images in this thought-ﬁeld are alike, since we remember an object by
our thought-image of
it,
and not by carrying the object around
in
our
heads. Hence the picture
in
our aura of what we have seen
in
the
hands of another
is
of the same sort—for untrained seers—as our
ideas on the subject of events
in
which we have not participated.
So
a
clairvoyant may, and
in
fact does, mistake these thought-pictures
one for the other, thus reducing the chances of certainty. If an
anxious mother imagines her child
in
danger and with vivid thought
pictures the details of
a
railway accident, the picture the seer may
see will be of something that never happened and
is
only the product
of emotion or imagination.
Mistakes
in
identity come next. These are more easily made on
the astral plane, which
is
the means for clairvoyance, than even upon
the visible one, and will arise from numerous causes. So numerous
and complex
is
this that to fully explain
it
would not only be hopeless
but tedious. For instance, the person, say at
a
distance, to whom
the clairvoyant eye
is
directed may look entirely different from real
ity, whether as to clothing or physiognomy. He may,
in
the depths of
winter, appear as clad
in
spring clothing, and your clairvoyant re
ports that, adding probably that
it
symbolizes something next spring.
But,
in
fact, the spring clothing was due to his thoughts about
a
well-worn comfortable suit of this sort, throwing
a
glamor of the
clothing before the vision of the seer. Cases like this have been
verified. The lover, dwelling on the form and features of his be
loved, or the criminal upon the one he has wronged, will work
a
pro
tean change and destroy identiﬁcation.

Another source of error will be found in the unwitting transfer to
the clairvoyant of your own thoughts, much altered either for better
or for worse. Or even the thoughts of someone else whom you have
just met or just heard from. For if you consult a seer on some line
of thought, having just read the ideas on the same subject of another
who thinks very strongly and very clearly, and whose character is
overmastering, the clairvoyant will in
all
likelihood feel the influence
of
the other and give you his ideas.

plainly evident that
psychic visions are usually dressed
up
by
the imagination
of
the seer,
and the history
of
psychism gives full support
to
this explanation.
In
the Middle Ages, sensitives saw angels and devils. Nuns had
visions
of
Christ, and suffered from strange delusions
of
heavenly
marriage, showing the close relation between the sexual instinct and
the psychic
or
astral plane. The correlation
of
sex aberrations with
religious mania
is
well-known
to
psychiatrists, and the similar con
nection
of
the commoner types
of
obsession has been observed
by
physicians who have tried
in
vain
to
bring some relief
to
weak-willed
victims
of
spiritualistic practices. One has simply to turn the pages
of
mediaeval books
on
witchcraft, such
as
Malleus Maleficarum, the
“Witch-hammer,” published
in
1489,
to
see that the Incubi and
Succubi which
so
horrified pious Christians
of
that day, became,
in
the nineteenth century, the “spirit” brides and grooms
of
modern
Spiritualism.
The form taken
by
psychic manifestation
is
determined primarily
by
the moral level
of
those
to
whom
it
comes, and
in
bright relief
to
the commoner types
of
psychic experience are the great healing
powers born
to
certain philanthropic physicians
of
the past. Such
a
man was Valentine Greatrakes, who lived
in
Ireland
in
the seven
teenth century.
In
1662
he
discovered that
he
had mesmeric power,
and was able
to
cure diseases
of
all
sorts simply
by
the laying
on
of
hands. After healing thousands
in
his native country,
he
went
to
England, exercising his beneficent power for the relief
of
many
eminent persons,
all
of
whom testified
to
the miraculous nature
of
his cures. The famous scientist, Robert Boyle, was among those who
acknowledged the healing power possessed
by
Greatrakes.
The seventeenth century was quite literally
a
continuous drama
of
psychic phenomena. The visions
of
such religious leaders
as
George Fox and John Bunyan began
at
about the middle
of
the
century. Fox made
it
clear that
he

I2 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
Deity, and the Quaker doctrine of Inner Light, a pure and en
nobling form of psychism, has continued to the present day. Bunyan,
more extravagant in his emotionalism, seems to have gone mad under
the influence of “the spirit.” Soon after his marriage, in 1649, “he
prayed to trees, to a broomstick, to the parish bull. He tried to
work miracles, ordering the puddles in the road to dry up and stak
ing his salvation on the result.” His later life was more rational,
although Grace Abounding, which Bunyan wrote in 1666, is in these
days said to contain “particulars sufficient to fill up the certificate and
case-book of a mental specialist.” One of the founders of the Phila
delphian Brethren, an English mystical society of the seventeenth
century, was Dr. John Pordage, whose visions were even more dra
matic than those of the more famous religious leaders of that day.
Pordage relates that he and the members of his society witnessed
daily scenes in heaven and hell. “They beheld the Prince of Dark
ness, and damned souls in the shape of men, pass by in grand proces
sion in chariots of clouds, and surrounded by lesser spirits in swarms.”
The visions, claimed the Philadelphians, continued for months.
George Fox often performed “spiritual” cures, and many of the
early Friends manifested clairvoyant and prophetic powers. The
Quakers certainly discovered some minor secrets of occultism, for
Cotton Mather relates that they used in his time to proselyte people
by merely stroking or breathing upon them. Persecuted as they
were, mesmeric powers must have grown among them as one result
of their constant devotion to what they believed to be right.
The rappings, movement of objects and other wonderful occur
rences that have come to be associated with modern spiritualism,
have been known in every age. In 1716-17, the home of John Wesley,
who was later to found the sect of Methodism, was the theater of
knockings, groans and even apparitions. Full accounts of these hap
penings have been left by the Wesley family. Later in the eighteenth
century, about a hundred years before the phenomena of 1848, Ger
many and Switzerland had their spiritualists, developing, or believ
ing in phenomena identical almost in
all
particulars with those
of
America. Among the various manifestations were so-called “spirit
writing,” and other forms
of
intercourse with what many thought
to
be
the spirit world.
In
1756, Emmanuel Swedenborg sat
in
a
house
in
Gottenberg and described the great fire that was then rag
ing
in
Stockholm, 300 miles away. Two days later
a
courier from
Stockholm confirmed Swedenborg's account
in
every detail, from
the time the fire started
to
when
it
was put out, even
as
to
the
particular houses that were destroyed.

PSYCHISM AND SPIRITUALISM
I
E:century of western history is marked by waves and out
bursts of psychic experience and phenomena. The cycle has
its
premonitory symptoms during the early decades
of
the
century, and usually flowers
at
the midpoint, continuing and spread
ing
its
influence for
a
time, then diminishing gradually until the
beginning
of
the next cycle. An interesting illustration
of
this cycle
is
provided
by
the Shakers,
an
ascetic Christian sect
of
which scarcely
a
dozen members are today alive. The psychological history
of
the
Shakers really begins with George Fox, founder
of
the Society
of
Friends, who
in
1647 became filled with the conviction that
he
was
a
chosen instrument of Providence. He felt that the voice of God
spoke within him. The religious reforms accomplished
by
the Quak
ers are well known, and the theosophist has nothing but respect and
admiration for the nobility
of
purpose which animated George Fox
and
so
many
of
his self-sacrificing followers. But we are presently
concerned with the fact that his inspiration, whatever
its
origin, took
the coloring
of
the emotional nature
of
George Fox—was filtered
through his psyche—and the significance
of
the moving force
he
felt
in
his heart was given
an
interpretation
he
thought
to
be
the true one.
George Fox made no impartial comparison
of
his psychological
experience with the psychological experiences
of
other men. Instead,
he
interpreted what
he
felt according
to
the prevailing religious
beliefs
of
his times. This fact identifies his experience
as
essentially
psychic
in
character.
So
it
was with Ann Lee, the “Mother Ann”
of
the Shakers. She
was
a
member
of
“The United Society
of
Believers
in
Christ's Second
Appearing,”
a
small Quaker sect which was led
by
James and Jane
Wardley
in
England
at
the middle
of
the eighteenth century. This
group
of
religious enthusiasts had been formed under the inspira
tion
of
some Camisards, French Huguenots who, years before, had
fled
to
England
to
escape the persecutions which followed the revoca
tion
of
the Edict
of
Nantes. Like
so
many who suffer for their
beliefs, the Camisards believed they had clairvoyant inspiration.
Mrs. Wardley was subject
to
seizures
of
“the spirit,” bringing her,
as
she thought, special illumination, and she predicted the second
coming
of
Christ
in
the form
of
a
woman. Ann Lee, who joined the
Wardleys
in
1758, was born
of
poor Manchester parents and
in
her
girlhood suffered from hysteria and convulsions. She preached
in
the streets
of
Manchester, accompanying her moving exhortations

with shouting, the unintelligible “speaking in tongues,” and other
physical manifestations. Hence the name, “Shaking Quakers,” which
later became simply “Shakers.” Imprisoned for this behavior, Ann
Lee claimed that Jesus appeared to her in her cell and became one
with her “in form and person,” which led the Wardleys and their
followers to recognize in her the female Christ—-the Bride of the
Lamb. Persecutions only excited her to another revelation—that
America would be the scene of Christ’s Kingdom on Earth. Emigrat
ing to the New World in I774 with a handful of followers, “Mother
Ann” established the ﬁrst Shaker community near Albany. A few
years later they were joined by a number of Baptist converts living
in Lebanon, and from that time the community grew and branched
out in Massachusetts and Connecticut.
The Shakers were perfectionists, believing that they had estab
lished a veritable heaven on earth, and if their conduct is any cri
terion, this conviction was well founded. Some writers have likened
them to the ancient Essenes. Their personal lives were models for
a successful communistic enterprise. It is curious that as a sect, Shak
erism survived and ﬂourished for more than I00 years—longer than
any other attempt at a communistic society—despite the rule of
complete chastity established by Ann Lee. They lived on a simple
fare, few of them eating meat, and were almost never ill. Celibates
all, their numbers were augmented only by conversion, and by I860
some 6,000 Shakers were in America, living in communities in New
York and New England. Of peculiar interest is the Shaker com
munity dance, which was a sort of shuffling march to one of their
hymns, varied by occasional “whirling” for a considerable time.
Although the Shakers always professed to have intimate inter
course with the “spirit world,” special intimations of the psychologi
cal upheaval which was to occur in America came to the Shakers in
I837. There were at that time sixty Shaker communities. The chil
dren of the Lebanon settlement were the ﬁrst to experience the de
velopment of clairvoyant powers, and were seized with trances. It
was not long before nearly all the members of the various Shaker
settlements found themselves in communication with “spirits.” Much
of their music they professed to have learned from “spirits.” Rea
lizing, however, that these manifestations would have marked them
as insane in the eyes of a sceptical world, they maintained complete
secrecy about their intercourse with “spirits”—most of whom were
Indians—until after 1848. After the remarkable phenomena of the
Fox sisters and other mediums had attracted widespread interest, an
elder of the community, Frederick B. Evans, related the visitations

experienced by the Shakers, which had begun eleven years earlier.
He said that the spirits had told the Shakers that the phenomena
were destined to spread throughout America and Europe. Nearly
every Shaker was a medium, according to their own word, and for
seven years after the ﬁrst “invasion” of the spirits whole houses of
Shakers were periodically obsessed by Indian “spirits.”
The experiences of the Shakers were more or less unique in their
collective anticipation of the psychic phenomena which ﬂooded over
America, marking the mid-century cycle of psychism. There were,
however, several individuals to whom religious revelations of a spir
itualistic character came during this earlier period. In I830 Joseph
Smith and six of his followers organized the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints to spread the teachings which had been revealed
to him in a series of visions. He was, he claimed, personally visited
by two persons of the Holy Trinity, the Father and Son. Later it
was made known to him that he had been selected to preach a new
gospel, and an angel who appeared to him directed the discovery of
the gold plates on which the Book of Mormon was engraved in an
unknown language. Enabled to translate the scripture by means of
glasses provided by the Lord, Joseph Smith became the prophet
whose new revelation was regarded as of equal authority with the
Jewish and Christian scriptures. In thirty years the Mormons were
well established in Utah and elsewhere, their number totalling some
200,000. Today there are 750,000 Mormons, serious men and
women who are universally respected for their honesty, industry and
sobriety. The head of the Mormon Church is believed by the Mor
mons to receive revelations direct from God, obtained through
dreams or waking visions, “by voices without visional appearance, or
by actual manifestation of the Holy Presence before the eye.”
Joseph Smith’s ﬁrst vision followed his attendance at a religious
revival held in Wayne County, New York. These outbursts of re
ligious psychism resulted in several such “inspirations.” The ﬁerce
revival of I831 began the moody meditations of John Humphrey
Noyes, who was to found the community of “Bible Communists” at
Oneida Creek. He abandoned law and took up the study of theology.
Finding no light in his course in divinity at Andover, he went to Yale,
and there he learned through dreams that God had a divine plan
which he, Noyes, was to realize in its perfection on earth. There fol
lowed a re-interpretation of the Gospel of Paul, which led to the
formation of the Perfectionists according to the program revealed
to this prophet of Christian communism. Like the Mormons, the

16 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
Noyes community suffered many vicissitudes, but due to the inde
fatigable labors so frequently exhibited by those who think them
selves divinely inspired, it achieved a success in economic and social
organization that is today well known. The Oneida Community is
famous for the silverware produced in its factories. Both com
munities have held unconventional ideas on the subject of marriage
the Mormons as part of their religious doctrines, the Oneida com
munists as practical eugenists attempting to improve the race physi
cally as well as “spiritually.”
Another forerunner of the spiritualistic cycle of the nineteenth
century was the famous seer of Poughkeepsie, Andrew Jackson
Davis. Born in 1826, as a boy he heard voices which gave him
advice and comfort. He developed clairvoyant powers and it was
discovered that he could diagnose disease. His powers were studied
and fostered by a travelling mesmerist, William Levingston, and in
I844. Davis began to report long ﬂights of soul experience while in
trance. He claimed to have two venerable instructors whom he later
identiﬁed as Galen and Swedenborg. In his nineteenth year he began
writing about his psychic experiences, the Rev. William Fishbough
acting as his amanuensis, who took down the revelations declared
by the young man after he had been placed in a trance condition.
During the course of his life Davis wrote twenty books, including a
remarkable autobiography giving account of his clairvoyance and his
psychic adventures, and his visions of the meaning of death and the
states after death. His Harmonial Philosophy comprised a series
of volumes and became virtually the bible of the spiritualists, passing
through forty editions. This work contains a remarkably coherent
theory of cosmogony similar to that of Swedenborg, and a detailed
description of the “spiritual world.” It also expounds a theory of
evolution. Davis predicted the coming cycle of spiritualism, writing
in I847 that “the world will hail with delight the ushering-in of that
era when the interiors of men will be opened, and the spiritual com
munion will be established. . . .” He should, however, be regarded
as a seer rather than an ordinary medium, for he speciﬁcally re
nounced the idea of “control” by spirits, although admitting their aid.

It should be realized that the abnormal states of consciousness
which had grown familiar to the people of Europe through the work
of Mesmer and his disciples were not unknown in America. The doc
trine of animal magnetism and its curative power ﬁrst taught by the
Viennese genius had various embodiments in America under other

names. As early as 1830 John Bovee Dods lectured in New Eng
land on “Electrical Psychology,” proclaiming electricity to be the
connecting link between mind and matter. A Frenchman, Charles
Poyen, began giving public demonstrations of Mesmerism in Amer
ica in 1836. Wandering through New England in 1838, Poyen met
Phineas Quimby, at Belfast, Maine. Quimby, who was then thirty
six, soon discovered that he, too, had unusual mesmeric power. Ob
taining a sensitive, Quimby began to diagnose the ills of the people
of the village, using the clairvoyant perception of his subject. He
found by experiment that it made little difference what medicine he
advised, becoming convinced that his cures were effected by mental
influence. On the basis of such experience Quimby evolved the theory
that
all
disease
is
a
mental delusion which can
be
eradicated
by
thought. After years
of
successful practice
at
Portland, Maine,
he
received
in
1861
a
letter from
a
Dr. Patterson, asking that Quimby
exercise his “wonderful power”
to
free Mrs. Patterson (later Mrs.
Mary Baker Eddy)
of
her invalidism. The essential ideas
of
Dr.
Quimby's therapy, which
he
began
to
record
in
1859
in
the now
famous “Quimby Manuscripts,” are best known
to
the world
as
Christian Science.
New Thought, too, derives principally from the doctrines
of
Phineas Quimby.
In
1869
a
Swedenborgian minister
of
New Hamp
shire, Warren Felt Evans, pupil and patient
of
Quimby, began the

of
New Thought literature with publication
of
The Mental
Cure, which,
it
appears from comparison, was little more than a re
ligious version
of
Quimby's understanding
of
what
he
had learned
from his own practice
of
Mesmerism. Thus, what had originally
been the scientific revelation
of
the eighteenth century, Mesmer's
rediscovery
of
the nervous fluid
of
the human psyche, and
its
extra
ordinary curative power through the will
of
the adept-physician,

of Mesmer’s great contribution. Modern hypnotism, too, is a limited
adaptation of Mesmer’s technique, shorn of its moral and meta
physical signiﬁcance.
III
We turn, now, to the origins of modern spiritualism in the nine
teenth century.
In December, 1847, John D. Fox and his family moved into a
small house in the little village of Hydesville, in Wayne County,
New York. Almost at once “knocks” or rappings began to occur
during the night. The sounds could not be explained as the result of
any natural cause and seemed to proceed from a bedroom or the
cellar beneath. The three girls, the youngest of whom was twelve
year-old Kate, complained of being touched by cold hands. On the
night of March 31, 1848, the family retired early, being exhausted
from these increasing disturbances which interfered with their rest.
The rappings, however, came louder than ever. Kate Fox, sitting
up in bed, was amused by the sounds, and snapping her ﬁngers
cried out:
“Here, Mr. Splitfoot, do as I dol”
This led to the startling discovery that the invisible agency which
caused the rappings would respond to intelligent direction. Raps ac
companied her movements. “Only look,” cried Kate; “look, it can
see as well as hearl” The sounds corresponded to her noiseless
motions. It was soon discovered that it was possible to communicate
with this agency, -questions being answered by raps which numbered
the letters of the alphabet. Neighbors were called and excitement
swept the community of Hydesville. Messages purporting to come
from the “spirit” of a murdered pedler were obtained in this way.
From information thus received investigators discovered the remains
of a man who had been buried in the cellar. By this strange event,
and by the correct guessing of the ages of persons, a measure of
veracity was established for the “spirits.” Interest in the phenomena
spread and soon the Fox children were made the subject of an unend
ing series of experiments and public exhibitions, for it had been
observed that the manifestations seemed to require their presence.
It became evident that the communications were not limited to those
from the deceased pedler, but included messages from a host of
“spirits,” one of them claiming to be Benjamin Franklin. In order
to escape the throng of curious wonder-seekers who gave the family
no peace, and to avoid the persecutions of the sceptical and unbeliev

ing, the Fox family moved to Rochester. Mrs. Fox, a sincere Meth
odist, was much disturbed by the abnormal manifestations which
everywhere followed Kate and her older sister, Margaretta. The
distracted mother prayed continually that the torment might cease,
and during the early days of the “rappings” her hair turned white
in a single week. Both she and the children strove in vain against
the “spirits,” which kept demanding public exhibitions. The oldest
of the girls, Leah, who was then a music teacher living in Rochester,
wrote many years later:
The general feeling of our family . . . was strongly adverse to all
this. . . . We regarded it as a great misfortune which had fallen upon
us; how, whence or Why we knew not. We resisted
it,
struggled
against
it,
and constantly and earnestly prayed for deliverance from
it. . . . If our will, earnest desires and prayers could have prevailed
or availed, the whole thing would have ended then and there, and
the world outside of our little neighborhood would never have heard
more of the Rochester Rappings, or of the unfortunate Fox family.‘
Nevertheless, the return of the rappings after
a
cessation of two
weeks
is
said to have been greeted with joy by the family. Re
luctantly, they undertook to follow the demands of the “spirits” and
become public mediums. To this occupation they devoted the rest
of their lives.
Meanwhile, following the publicity given to the Fox children,
it
became known that similar manifestations were taking place else
where. In the words of Alfred Russel Wallace,
“.
. . at the same
time other mediums were discovered
in
different parts of the country,
as
if
a
special development of this abnormal power were then occur
ing.”' This seemed,
in
effect,
a
conﬁrmation of the assurance given
by the “spirits” to the Fox sisters that the manifestations were not
to be conﬁned to them, but would go “all over the world.” Rappings
occurred as far west as St. Louis and Cincinnati, and
in
Maine,
Massachusetts and New York. By

50 séances arranged according
to the direction of the “spirits” were being held
in
California, Ore
gon, Texas, and
in
several southern states. Religious-minded men
and women formed Spiritualist sects, claiming messages from the
apostles and the Hebrew prophets of old. Thomas Lake Harris,
writer and preacher, joined with Spiritualists to found the “Apostolic
Brotherhood,” which culminated
in
a
spiritualist community known
as the Mountain Cove Movement. Many clergymen developed
psychic capacities and became leaders of small bands of spiritualists.

20 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
Despite vicious attacks on the new “revelation” by sceptics and
orthodox Christians, interest in Spiritualism spread rapidly. Here
and there men of cultivation and learning were attracted to séances.
A few Well-known scientists began to investigate the alleged phe
nomena. Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, sat with
the Fox sisters in New York, saying in a sympathetic article,
Whatever may be the origin or cause of the “rappings,” the ladies
in whose presence they occur do not make them. We tested this
thoroughly, and to our entire satisfaction. Their conduct and bearing
is as unlike that of deceivers as possible; and we think no one ac
quainted with them could believe them at all capable of engaging in
so daring, impious, and shameful a juggle as this would be if they
caused the sounds. And it is not possible that such a juggle should
have been so long perpetrated in public.’
Among the eminent men who became convinced of the reality of
spiritualistic phenomena was Judge W. Edmonds, a justice of the
Supreme Court of New York, known for his honesty and fearless
ness. He publicly defended the mediums in letters to the press. N.
P. Tallmadge, a former governor of Wisconsin, was another who
supported the claims of the mediums after attending a séance given
in Washington by the Fox sisters. In the years I851 and I852 sev
eral spiritualistic journals were established, in which all manner of
supernatural communications were recorded. While the original
phenomena of Kate and Margaretta Fox had been limited to “rap
pings,” other phases of the phenomena developed with the multipli
cation of mediums. Automatic writing became common; messages
alleged to be from the illustrious dead were given by entranced
sensitives, and “spirit lights” and the movement of heavy bodies
were repeatedly reported.
From these beginnings modern Spiritualism spread all over the
world. Few scientists were willing to jeopardize their reputations
by deigning to recognize even the possibility that the phenomena
were not fraudulent. Notable exceptions, however, included the
celebrated Dr. Robert Hare, professor of chemistry in the University
of Pennsylvania, who in I854 published Spiritualism Scientiﬁcally
Demonstrated, an account of the elaborate experiments which con
vinced him that the manifestations were genuine. He had originally
undertaken the task of investigation in order to destroy scientiﬁcally
“the gross delusion called Spiritualism,” but was soon overwhelmed
by evidences of the supernormal. However, even so eminent a man

as he was unable to persuade the American Association for the Pro
motion of Science to consider the subject of psychic phenomena.
That body at one of its annual conventions turned down all the pro
posals for investigation which he presented. No more successful in
gaining a hearing from the scientiﬁc world was Prof. James
Mapes, president of the Mechanics Institute, a distinguished chem
ist who had been honored by numerous scientific bodies here and
abroad. Beginning his study of spiritualistic phenomena in order to
redeem respected friends who, he declared, were “fast running to
mental seed and imbecility,” he ended as an advocate of spiritualism.

It must not be supposed that because Theosophy admits the reality
of these phenomena, it also approves the theories of the Spiritualists.
Nothing could be further from the truth. A full explanation of the
identity of the seance “spirits” and of spiritualistic phenomena gen
erally is provided in the pamphlet, Where Are the Dead? (pub
lished by Theosophy Company). This pamphlet, which is made
up of statements taken from the basic teachings of Theosophy,
should be studied carefully in connection with the whole problem
of Spiritualism. Theosophy does not deny the existence of disem
bodied spiritual intelligences, but it shows that such beings cannot
be reached by the methods of the Spiritualists. As Madame Bla
vatsky explains in The Secret Doctrine, it is only “by paralyzing
his lower personality, and arriving thereby at the full knowledge of
the non-separateness of his higher Self from the One absolute
SELF,” that man can, during his terrestrial life, arrive at that state
of consciousness in which such soul-communion with high spiritual
beings is possible.
Theosophy teaches also that the spirits of the dead cannot return
to earth—save in rare and exceptional cases (see Where dre the
Dead?), nor do they communicate with men except by entirely sub
jective means. That which does communicate, through the medium,
or appear objectively as a “materialization,” is nothing more than
the phantom of the ex-physical man, his more or less coherent psychic
remains. The spiritual individuality of the disembodied cannot ma
terialize, nor can it return from its own exalted mental sphere to the
plane of terrestrial objectivity. The idea alone that the intellectual
conscious souls of one’s father, mother, daughter or brother find
their bliss in a “Summer Land” is enough to make one lose respect
for one’s departed ones. To believe that a pure spirit can feel happy

22 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
while doomed to witness the sins, mistakes, treachery, and, above
all, the sufferings of those from whom it is severed by death and
whom it loves best, without being able to help them, would be a
maddening thought.
Everything depends on the view taken of Spirit and Soul, or
Individuality and Personality. Spiritualists confuse the two into
one; Theosophy separates them, and says that no Spirit will revisit
the earth, though its former “animal soul” may. The “spook” that
visits the seances, mistakenly called a “spirit” by the Spiritualists,
is only the lower animal intelligence of the man that has died. The
gross physical memories of this entity, which is the psychic corpse
of the deceased, may be drawn to a seance and acquire artiﬁcial life
from the vital psychic atmosphere surrounding the medium. In the
medium’s aura it lives a kind of vicarious life and reasons and
speaks through the medium’s brain, deceiving the sitters with frag
mentary recollections of the past. But such communications are no
more “spiritual” than the playing of a cracked phonograph record.
Other manifestations, such as “rappings,” slate-writing, and the
so-called “materializations,” are produced by the medium’s astral
body. (See section on Hypnotism.) The laws governing such phe
nomena are given in greater detail in the portions of the Theosophi
cal literature devoted to this subject. What is important to be
noted here is the grave danger to both medium and sitters in ex
posing themselves to the degrading inﬂuences of contact with these
“shells” or psychic remains, which have been separated from the
higher part of the soul and remain in the earth’s atmosphere, slowly
disintegrating, and spreading psychic infection and moral disease
among those who become passively open to their inﬂuence.
Mediumship and dabbling in Spiritualism, on the supposition that
such practices are “spiritual,” can bring only suffering, and even
mental and physical break-down, in the end, to the psychically in
clined. Theosophy, from the earliest days of the Movement, has
always warned against experimentation and curiosity-hunting in the
ﬁeld of psychic phenomena, as an ignorant playing with sinister
forces that act invisibly and destructively on the victims of spiritual
istic delusions.
While interest in Spiritualism gradually died out during the clos
ing years of the nineteenth century, and was seldom heard from in
the ﬁrst decade of the twentieth century, the loss of loved ones
occasioned by World War I brought a sudden revival of the doc
trines of the Summer Land of spirits. The spiritualistic writings of

PSYCHISM AND SPIRITUALISM 23
the eminent physicist, Sir Oliver Lodge, came into prominence, and
the pitiful account of his “communications” with his son Raymond,
killed in the war, won the sympathy of the few and the curiosity of
the many. A study printed by the Journal of 14 bnormal and Social
Psychology (July, 1942) reports that the number of American
magazines devoted to Spiritualism grew from ﬁfty-two in 1915 to
a peak of 136 in 1920, then falling off to ﬁfty-eight in 1930. English
publications dealing with the same object increased from seven to
seventy during the same period and fell off to fourteen in 192 5.
Similar increases occurred for journals in the more digniﬁed ﬁeld
of “psychic research.” One of the effects of this revival of interest
was the Scientiﬁc American investigation of “Margery,” famous
Boston medium, which, while probably increasing the circulation of
that worthy magazine for a short period, accomplished little for the
science of psychic research. The committee of scientists, headed by
Dr. Harlow Shapley of the Harvard Observatory, who sat with the
medium, officially reported nothing of importance, although the em
inent psychologist, Dr. William McDougall, who served on the com
mittee, a few years later was instrumental in establishing the pro
gram of study of telepathy (now called Extra Sensory Perception)
at Duke University. Dr. McDougall’s motives in undertaking
psychic research were almost unique among scientiﬁc men in that they
approximated the reason that H. P. Blavatsky gave for the intelligent
investigation of supernormal phenomena. He said in 1923:
Unless Psychical Research can discover facts incompatible with
materialism, materialism will continue to spread. No other power
can stop it; revealed religion and metaphysical philosophy are equally
helpless before the advancing tide. And if that tide continues to rise
and advance as it is doing now, all signs point to the view that it will
be a destroying tide, that it will sweep away all the hard-won gains
of humanity, all the moral traditions built up by the efforts of count
less generations for the increase of truth, justice and charity.
In 1937, just one year before his death, Dr. McDougall repeated
his appeal for the rejection of materialism with some leading ques
tions in the ﬁrst issue of a journal devoted to the investigation of the
supernormal powers in man. “What,” he asked, “are the relations
of mind and matter?”
Are mental processes always and everywhere intimately and utterly
dependent upon material or physical organizations? Do the volitions,
the strivings, the desires, the joys and sorrows, the judgments and
beliefs of men make any difference to the historical course of the
events of our world, as the mass of men at all times have believed?

24 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
Or does the truth lie with those few philosophers and scientists who,
with or without some more or less plausible theory in support of their
view, conﬁdently reject well-nigh universal beliefs, telling us that
the physical is coextensive with the mental and that the powers and
potentialities of mind may be deﬁned by the laws of the physical
sciences?
The philosophic interest in psychic research harbored by Dr. Mc
Dougall has been all too rare. Even the somewhat trivial methods
introduced in the Duke program of investigation—the “guessing”
of cards stamped with symbols—have been imitated in forms of
parlor entertainment, and too often the telepathic powers discovered
by individuals in themselves have stimulated a course of mediumistic
“development.” It is a pity that Dr. McDougall did not realize the
importance of “metaphysical philosophy” as the all-important guide
to investigation of psychic phenomena. Nothing short of philosophy
has the power to prevent the blind rushing of multitudes after the
will-’o-the-wisps of “spirits,” and to sharpen the discrimination of
those who ﬁnd hidden capacities blossoming within themselves. The
increasing instances of psychism in the late thirties and early forties
of the present century are but preludes to a mighty storm of phenom
enalism and wonder-seeking, destined, according to the law of cycles
taught by Theosophy, to become a psychological hurricane during
the period that is now almost upon us.
While the nineteenth century cycle of psychism did not show its
real strength until 184.8, there was at that time no planetary war
to hasten the longing for communication with those unnaturally cut
off from life in the full bloom of youth. Then, as now, premonitory
symptoms occurred, as among the Shakers, and there were the ex
periences of the American seer, Andrew Jackson Davis, and of
Daniel Dunglas Home, the English medium, but no foundation for
extensive acceptance of the phenomena existed before 184.8. Only
the heterodox followers of Anton Mesmer had any intimation of the
psychological laws which might have helped to explain the medium
istic “miracles,” and these few outcasts soon joined the Spiritualistic
movement, of which they became some of the leaders and inter
preters. It remained for Madame Blavatsky, in 1875, to give voice
to the essential warnings which spiritualists so sorely needed.
There is a law of occult development that works its inexorable
way with all such children of their age who dare to raise the veil
of Isis:
It is impossible to employ spiritual forces if there is the slightest
tinge of selﬁshness remaining in the operator. For, unless the inten

tion is entirely unalloyed, the spiritual will transfonn itself into the
psychic, act on the Astral plane, and dire results may be produced
by it.
It was not for nothing that Jesus urged his disciples, “Come ye out
and be ye separate.” Unless the heart be purged of all impurity, all
compromises with human weakness and desire set aside, no door will
be found to the sacred temple of truth, and the terrible occult reality
will inevitably destroy all those who rashly approach without learn
ing ﬁrst the rule of obedience to time-honored laws.

The “scientiﬁc” investigation of psychic phenomena, as distin
guished from the religious sects of Spiritualism, has been going on
for many years, adding little knowledge of the laws of the phe
nomena, but at least convincing all those who have honestly looked
into the ﬁeld that supernormal events are a reality, whatever may
be their meaning. While psychic research is still a somewhat sec
tarian cultus on the fringe of orthodox and accepted science, it can
not be denied that these conductors of psychic autopsies have slowly
been gaining recognition. The ﬁrst study of spiritualistic phenomena
by a respected man of science was Prof. Wm. Crookes’ Researches in
the Phenomena of Spiritualism, published in the 1870's. Since his
day other leaders have lent their names to psychic research, the most
outstanding in America being William James, the eminent psychol
ogist. Charles Richet, the French biologist, admitted to a belief in
the fact of psychic phenomena, candidly confessing his inability to
explain them. In 1920 Baron von Schrenck Notzing’s Phenomena
of Materialization appeared, a weighty volume which left little doubt
that materializations of subtle psychic forms do occur under pro
pitious conditions. Another highlight in this progressive “naturaliza
tion” of psychic science was the award in 1937 by Duke University
of a doctoral degree in Philosophy to John F. Thomas, whose con
tribution to “knowledge” was a 320-page record of spiritualistic
communications from his deceased wife!
The work of investigators like W. Dunne, whose Experiment
With Time (1927) brought the scientiﬁc world convincing testi
mony of the fact of prophetic dreams; of Dr. Charles Jung, who
made the startling discovery that dream symbols often have the
same pattern as alchemical ﬁgures of the Middle Ages; of Prof.
Bart J. Bok, eminent astronomer of Harvard, who now admits that
there is some truth in astrology, and of many other workers in re

search, has been undermining the scepticism of scientists for a decade
or more. Dr. Einstein’s qualiﬁed approval of Dr. Gustav Strom
berg’s attempt to (provide a scientiﬁc basis for immortality in The
Soul of the Universe must also have had its effect.
Meanwhile, literary ﬁgures, all the way from minor luminaries
like Nina Wilcox Putnam and Stewart Edward White to writers
in True Story, have been purveying their psychic revelations to a
growing crowd of enthusiasts and believers. The noted author of
Credo, years later, in The Unobstructed Universe, revealed a life
long interest in Spiritualism, and set forth claims to receiving from
the spirit of the late Mrs. White, herself a sensitive, a new psychic
cosmology and philosophy of life.
The Spiritualist cults are gaining a new lease on life by the recent
appearance of several child mediums, innocent victims of psychic
curiosity, whose achievements have been thoroughly exploited by the
sensation-seeking press. Picture magazines, avid for circulation-get
ting material of this quality, have reproduced the more extraordinary
of “spirit” photographs, drawn from private collections. Lilydale,
New York, the Spiritualist Mecca, has more than once received
dramatic presentation; notably, in Life for Aug. 2, 1937, when
the whole mythology of nineteenth century spiritualism was revived
and illustrated, with appropriate description in the quip-like style of
the Life editors. -
Teachers of hypnotism abound, and despite warnings by physi
cians high in their profession, the fascination of this conjuror’s art
is interesting otherwise sober medical men in techniques that are
broadly advertised by these modern Charcots. Especially pernicious
attempts are being made in scientiﬁcally authoritative quarters to
dispel the popular idea that hypnotism is “Black Magic,” while the
cures it has supposedly brought about are recounted in glowing terms.
Volumes could be devoted to description of these symptoms of
renascent psychism, of the unbelievable naiveté of modern cultists,
and of the tragic ignorance of the occult laws that men who imagine
themselves scientists are on the verge of violating in extreme degree.
Suffice it that the evidence is ample to show that the world of psychic
interests and undertakings is a veritable jungle of confusion, full of
fascinating sights and sounds, and rich in the attractions of escap
ism so longingly sought by a world strained almost to the breaking
point by the ﬁerce selﬁshness and competitive struggle for existence
which dominate modern “civilization,” and by the unrelieved ten
sions of periodic wars.

HYPNOTISM AND “YOGA”
HE real character of hypnotism and hypnotic phenomena is
I
difficult for the average man to recognize, not only because of
the admitted ignorance of scientiﬁc investigators in this ﬁeld,
but also, because of the unknown areas of human nature which are
involved. All present practice of hypnotism traces directly or indi
rectly to Anton Mesmer, the great healer and occultist of the eigh
teenth century. Unfortunately for modern medicine, however, Mes
mer’s doctrines were not accepted in professional circles, and the
development of hypnotism fell into the charge of men who were
either ignorant of occult law, or irresponsible in the use of the mes
meric force. Today the medical historians of hypnotism rejoice that
hypnotism has been divorced from Mesmer’s theories, as though the
separation were a great step of progress, little realizing that Mesmer
had knowledge of the psychological constitution of man that enabled
him to use his power in a way not open to ordinary men.
Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in the practice of
hypnotism. In the name of “science,” students in scores of colleges
anhd
uniyersities
are being used as subjects
in
hypnotic
elalcperirpents,
w ile
p
ysicians are more and more turning to this met od
o
con
trolling the minds of their patients. Amateurs, often lacking the
skill of more experienced practitioners, are introducing hypnotism
as parlor entertainment. Meanwhile, “experts” are claiming that
hypnotism
is
“harmless” for normal persons. One such writer, Dr.
Paul Campbell Young, had the temerity to maintain, in the Psycho
logical Bulletin for September, 1926, that “books that point out the
dangers of hypnotism are far more dangerous than hypnotism itself.”
Echoing such allegedly “scientiﬁc” pronouncements, popular writers
for the mass magazines are carrying to the uninformed and defence
less public the news that hypnotism
is
capable of miraculous “cures”
in
many cases of mental and physical ills. In the Reader's Digest
for October, 1943, an article named “Hypnotism Comes of Age”
makes the unqualiﬁed statement: “You will suﬂer no harmful mental
or physical after-eﬂects. It’s quite possible that hypnosis will fail to
produce the desired results
in
your case, but you’ll be no worse off
for the trial.” The pernicious falsity of this statement would be diffi
cult to equal. It suppresses facts that are well known and
is
merely
propaganda for hypnotism.

28 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
The dangers of hypnotism were better understood ﬁfty years ago
than they are today. Jean Marie Charcot, the famous French in
vestigator of hypnotic states, wrote in the Forum for April, 1890:
For several years the principal towns of Europe have been over
run by persons . . . bearing high-sounding titles, who invite the
people to hypnotizing performances given in the local theatres. . . .
We can track a showman magnetizer of this sort by his victims
everywhere. When he has gone, it is noticed that subjects . . . with
whom he succeeded best become nervous and irritable. Some of them
fall of their own accord into a deep sleep, out of which it is not
easy to awaken them; thereafter they are unﬁtted for the per
formance of the duties of every-day life. Others, and they the
majority, are seized with convulsions resembling the crises of con
ﬁrmed hysteria.
Charcot maintained that the practice of hypnotism should be
limited to trained physicians. William Q. Judge, co-founder, with
Madame Blavatsky, of the Theosophical Movement, in commenting
on Charcot’s view, added his own opinion that hypnotism should be
prohibited by law. “No one,” he urged, “but some few high-minded
and learned physicians should be allowed to practice it. I would as
quickly prohibit the general mass of physicians from using it as the
general mass of the public, for I regard it as a dangerous and
injurious power. In the present age I would vote for its total seclu
sion from use for the present.”
The following analysis of hypnotism, taken from Mr. Judge's
writings, gives the Theosophical reasons for condemning the practice.

a
thought, no matter what the channel or instrument, whether organ
of sense or mental center, by which
it
comes before him. These
thoughts may be words, ideas, or pictures. The soul-man has to have
an intermediary or connecting link with Nature through and by
which he may cognize and experience. This link
is
an ethereal double
or counterpart of his physical body, dwelling
in
the latter; and the
physical body
is
Nature so far as the soul-man

concerned. In this
ethereal double (called astral body) are the sense-organs and cen

channels or means for concentrating the physical vibrations so as to

transmit them to the astral organs and centers where the soul per
ceives them as ideas or thoughts. This inner ethereal man is made
of the ether which science is now admitting as a necessary part of
Nature, but while it is etheric it is none the less substantial.
Speaking physically, all outer stimulus from nature is sent from
without to within. But in the same way stimuli may be sent from
the within to the without, and in the latter mode is it that our
thoughts and desires propel us to act. Stimuli are sent from the astral
man within to the periphery, the physical body, and may dominate
the body so as to alter it or bring on a lesion partial or total. Cases
of the hair turning grey in a night are thus possible. And in this way
a suggestion of a blister may make a physical swelling, secretion,
inﬂammation, and sore on a subject who has submitted himself to
the inﬂuence of the hypnotizer. The picture or idea of a blister is
impressed on the astral body, and that controls all the physical
nerves, sensations, currents, and secretions. It is done through the
sympathetic nervous plexus and ganglia. It was thus that ecstatic
fanatical women and men by brooding on the pictured idea of the
wounds of Jesus produced on their own bodies, by internal impres
sion and stimulus projected to the surface, all of the marks of crown
of thorns and wounded side. It was self-hypnotization, possible only
in fanatical hysterical ecstacy. The constant brooding imprinted the
picture deeply on the astral body; then the physical molecules, ever
changing, became impressed from within and the stigmata were the
result. In hypnotizing done by another the only difference is one
of time, as in the latter instances the operator has simply to make
the image and impress it on the subject after the hypnotic process has
been submitted to, whereas in self-hypnotization a long-continued
ecstasy is necessary to make the impression complete.
When the hypnotic process—or subjugation, as I call it—is sub
mitted to, a disjunction is made between the soul-man and the astral
body, which then is for the time deprived of will, and is the sport of
any suggestion coming in unopposed, and those may and do some
times arise outside of the mind and intention of the operator. From
this arises the sensitiveness to suggestion. The idea, or thought, or
picture of an act is impressed by suggesting it on the astral body,
and then the patient is waked. At the appointed time given by the
suggestor a secondary sleep or hypnotic state arises automatically,
and then, the disjunction between soul and astral body coming about
of itself, the suggested act is performed unless—as happens rarely
-—the soul-man resists sufficiently to prevent it. Hence we point to

an element of danger in the fact that at the suggested moment the
hypnotic state comes on secondarily by association. I do not know
that hypnotizers have perceived this. It indicates that although the
subject be dehypnotized, the influence of the operator, once thrown
on the subject, will remain until the day of the operator's death.
But how is it that the subject can see on a blank card the pic
ture of a object which you have merely willed to be on it? This
is because every thought of any one makes a picture; and a thought
of a definite image makes a definite form in the astral light in which
the astral body exists and functions, interpenetrating also every part
of the physical body. Having thus imaged the picture on the card,
it remains in the astral light or sphere surrounding the card, and is
there objective to the astral sense of the hypnotized subject.
The great question mooted is whether there is or is not any actual
fluid thrown
off
by
the mesmerizer. Many deny
it,
and nearly
all
hypnotizers refuse
to
admit
it.
H.
P.
Blavatsky declares there
is
such
a
fluid, and those who can see into the plane
to
which
it
belongs
assert its existence as
a
subtle form of matter. This
is
not at all in
consistent with the experiments
in
hypnotism, for the fluid can have
its
own existence
at
the same time that people may
be
self-hypnotized
by
merely inverting their eyes while looking
at
some bright object.
This fluid
is
composed
in
part
of
the astral substance around every
one, and
in
part
of
the physical atoms
in
a
finely divided state. By
some, this astral substance
is
called the aura. But that word is in
definite,
as
there are many sorts
of
aura and many degrees
of
its
expression. These will not
be
known, even
to
Theosophists
of
the
most willing mind, until the race
as
a
whole has developed up
to
that
point. So the word will remain
in
use for the present.
This aura, then,
is

by
the mesmerizer upon his subject,
and

Theosophist and the non-Theosophist are at fault, since the words
spoken are sometimes far above the ordinary intelligence or power
of the subject in waking state. I therefore propose to give in the
rough the theory of what actually does take place, as has been known
for ages to those who see with the inner eye, and as will one day
be discovered and admitted by science.
When the hypnotic or mesmerized state is complete--and often
when it is partial—there is an immediate paralyzing of the power
of the body to throw its impressions, and thus modify the concep
tions of the inner being. In ordinary waking life everyone, without
being able to disentangle himself, is subject to the impressions from
the whole organism; that is to say, every cell in the body, to the
most minute, has its own series of impressions and recollections, all
of which continue to impinge on the great register, the brain, until
the impression remaining in the cell is fully exhausted. And that
exhaustion takes a long time. Further, as we are adding continually
to them, the period of disappearance of impression is indeﬁnitely
postponed. Thus the inner person is not able to make itself felt.
But, in the right subject, those bodily impressions are by mesmerism
neutralized for the time, and at once another effect follows, which
is equivalent to cutting the general off from his army and com
pelling him to seek other means of expression.
The brain—in cases where the subject talks—-is left free suf
ﬁciently to permit it to obey the commands of the mesmerizer and
compel the organs of speech to respond. So much in general.
We have now come to another part of the nature of man which
is a land unknown to the Western world and its scientists. By mes
merism other organs are set to work disconnected from the body,
but which in normal state function with and through the latter.
These are not admitted by the world, but they exist, and are as
real as the body is—in fact some who know say they are more real
and less subject to decay, for they remain almost unchanged from
birth to death. These organs have their own currents, circulation
if you will, and methods of receiving and storing impressions. They
not only keep them but very often give them out, and when the
person is mesmerized their exit is untrammelled by the body.
They are divided into many classes and grades, and each one of
them has a whole series of ideas and facts peculiar to itself, as well
as centres in the ethereal body to which they relate. Instead now of
the brain’s dealing with the sensations of the body, it deals with
something quite different, and reports what these inner organs see

in any part of space to which they are directed. And in place of your
having waked up the Higher Self, you have merely uncovered one
of the many sets of impressions and experiences of which the inner
man is composed, and who is himself a long distance from the Higher
Self. These varied pictures, thus seized from every quarter, are
normally overborne by the great roar of the physical life, which-is
the sum total of possible expression of a normal being on the physical
plane whereon we move. They show themselves usually only by
glimpses when we have sudden ideas or recollections, or in dreams
when our sleeping may be crowded with fancies for which we cannot
ﬁnd a basis in daily life. Yet the basis exists, and is always some
one or other of the million small impressions of the day, passed un
noticed by the physical brain, but caught unerringly by means of
other sensoriums belonging to our astral double. For this astral
body, or double, permeates the physical one as colour does the bowl
of water. And although to the materialistic conceptions of the pres
ent day such a misty shadow is not admitted to have parts, powers,
and organs, it nevertheless has all of these with surprising power
and grasp. Although perhaps a mist, it can exert under proper
conditions a force equal to the viewless wind when it levels to earth
the proud constructions of puny man.
In the astral body, then, is the place to look for the explanation
of mesmerism and hypnotism. The Higher Self will explain the
ﬂights we seldom make into the realm of spirit, and is the God-—
the Father—within who guides His children up the long steep road
to perfection. Let not the idea of it be degraded by chaining it to
the low ﬂoor of mesmeric phenomena, which any healthy man or
woman can bring about if they will only try. The grosser the oper
ator the better, for thus there is more of the mesmeric force, and if
it be the Higher Self that is affected, then the meaning of it would
be that gross matter can with ease affect and deﬂect the high spirit—
and this is against the testimony of the ages.
The mesmeric ﬂuid brings the paralysis about by ﬂowing from the
operator and creeping steadily over the whole body of the subject,
changing the polarity of the cells in every part and thus disconnect
ing the outer from the inner man. As the whole system of physical
nerves is sympathetic in all its ramiﬁcations, when major sets of
nerves are affected others by sympathy follow into the same condi
tion. So it often happens with mesmerized subjects that the arms or
legs are suddenly paralyzed without being directly operated on, or,
as frequently, the sensation due to the ﬂuid is felt ﬁrst in the fore
arm, although the head was the only place touched.

HYPNOTISM AND “YOGA” 33
There are many secrets about this part of the process, but they
will not be given out, as it is easy enough for all proper purposes
to mesmerize a subject by following what is already publicly known.
By means of certain nerve points located near the skin the whole
system of nerves may be altered in an instant, even by a slight breath
from the mouth at a distance of eight feet from the subject. But
modern books do not point this out.
When the paralyzing and change of polarity of the cells are
complete the astral man is almost disconnected from the body. Has
he any structure? What mesmerizer knows? How many probably
will deny that he has any structure at all? Is he only a mist, an idea?
And yet, again, how many subjects are trained so as to be able to
analyze their own astral anatomy?
Disjoin this being from the outer body with which he is linked,
and the divorce deprives him of freedom temporarily, making him
the slave of the operator. But mesmerizers know very well that the
subject can and does often escape from control, puzzling them
often, and often giving them fright. This is testiﬁed to by all the
best writers in the Western schools.
Now the inner man is not by any means omniscient. He has an
understanding that is limited by his own experience, as said before.
Therefore, error creeps in if we rely on what he says in the mesmeric
trance as to anything that requires philosophical knowledge, except
with rare cases that are so infrequent as not to need consideration
now. For neither the limit of the subject’s power to know, nor the
effect of the operator on the inner sensoriums described above, is
known to operators in general, and especially not by those who do
not accept the ancient division of the inner nature of man. The
effect of the operator is almost always to colour the reports made
by the subject.
Body, soul, and astral man properly in relation give us a sane
man; hypnotized, the relation is broken and we have a person who
is not for the time wholly sane. Acute maniacs are those in whom
the disjunction between astral man and soul is complete. VVhere the
hypnotized one remains for months in that state, the astral man has
become the slave of the body and its recollections, but as the soul
is not concerned no real memory is present and no recollection of
the period is retained.
The varied personalities assumed by some subjects brings up the
doctrine of a former life on earth for all men. The division between
soul and astral man releases the latter from some of the limitations

of brain memory so that the inner memory may act, and we then
have a case of a person reénacting some part of his former life or
lives. But a second possibility also exists,—that by this process
another and different entity may enter the body and brain and mas
querade as the real person. Such entities do exist and are the astral
shells of men and women out of the body. If they enter, the person
becomes insane; and many a maniac is simply a body inhabited by
an entity that does not belong to it.
The process of hypnotizing is as yet unknown in respect to what
does happen to the molecules. We claim that those molecules are
pressed from periphery to center instead of being expanded from
the inside to the surface. This contraction is one of the symptoms
of death, and therefore hypnotizing is a long step toward physical
and moral death. The view expressed by Dr. Charcot that a subject
is liable to fall under the inﬂuence at the hands of anyone should be
admitted, as also that in the wake of the hypnotizer will be found a
host of hysteriacs, and that it all should be regulated by law is un
questionable. I go still further and say that many persons are already
in a half-hypnotized state, easily inﬂuenced by the unprincipled or
the immoral; that the power to hypnotize and to be sensitive to it
are both progressive states of our racial evolution; that it can and
will be used for selﬁsh, wicked, and degrading purposes unless the
race, and especially the occidental portion of
it,
understands and
practises true ethics based on the brotherhood of man. Ethics of the
purest are found
in
the words of Jesus, but are universally negatived
by Church, State, and individual. The Theosophical doctrines of
man and nature give
a
true and necessary basis and enforcement to
ethics, devoid of favoritism or illogical schemes of eternal damna
tion. And only through those doctrines can the dangers of hyp
notism be averted, since legislation, while affixing penalties, will not
alter or curtail private acts of selﬁshness and greed.

of the psychological constitution of man completes the analogy, for
the effect of hypnotism may be just as catastrophic as the more vio
lent eﬂect of an explosion. One is external and physical, the other in
ternal and psychic, attacking the inner organism of man with a subtle
disintegration that remains unperceived until its ravages are far ad
vanced. It is not contended that hypnotism invariably produces this
result, but that, in view of the nature of the process, such is the com
mon effect. Many factors, among them the motives of both prac
titioner and subject, enter in. The real causes of disaster are the
non-moral approach to man’s subtle psychological nature, and the
blinding ignorance of the semi-occult character of the forces that are
invoked.
'
Dangers similar to those involved in hypnotism confront those
who indulge in the Eastern psychological practices that have re
cently become popular in the West. Many people begin “breathing
exercises” and postural disciplines under the delusion that they are
“spiritual.” Suffice it to point out that the Oriental teachers dispose
of this idea by calling all such practices Hatha Yoga, which means,
simply, physical discipline. There is nothing spiritual about it.
The hazards of Hatha Yoga are undreamed of by the average
westerner. A few years ago, an English writer, Gerald Heard, spoke
of breathing exercises as “the most instant and powerful of all the
physical methods of affecting, altering and enlarging consciousness.”
While tempering this judgment with some warnings against the
consequences of this physical kind of “yoga,” he adds that “it is a
risk we have no choice except to take.”
For those who are attracted to taking this “risk,” the following
experiment, conducted by Wm. Q. Judge, is described. Mr. Judge
wrote:
The persons present were myself, a well-known physician whose
name I can give, and the practitioner. The physician ﬁrst took the
person’s pulse for three minutes and found it to be running at ninety
six beats per minute; and then the experiment began with the prac
tice with the following result:
First minute. Pulse fell to 91 beats.
Second minute. Pulse fell to 81 beats.
Third minute. Pulse remained at 81 beats.
A delay of ﬁve minutes then occurred, when the practice was begun
again for six minutes, with the following result:
First minute. Pulse running at 91 beats a minute.

Second minute. Pulse fell to 86 beats.
Third minute. Pulse remained at 86.
Fourth minute. Pulse fell to 76.
Fifth minute. Remained at 76.
Sixth minute. Remained at 76.
This shows a reduction in the pulse action of twenty beats in
fourteen minutes. It also shows that after the ﬁrst three minutes
the intermission of ﬁve minutes was not enough to enable the pulse
to go back to ninety-six beats, at which it started. The ﬁrst three
minutes showed a fall of ﬁve beats in the ﬁrst minute and ten in
the next minute, making ﬁfteen beats reduction for the three minutes.
It therefore appears that one of the accompaniments of this prac
tice is a distinct effect upon the action of the heart, and as all the
Hindu books invariably state that great caution should be used and
that there are dangers, we can see here a very great danger found in
an effect upon the heart’s action, resulting in a reduction of pulse
beats of twenty beats in fourteen minutes. The Hindu books to
which I have referred, and which are the only works through which
inquirers have heard about these practices, also say that a guide who
is fully acquainted with the subject is necessary for each student, and
that every one of these practices requires an antidote for its effects
through other regulations tending to neutralize the bad physical
effects. Students have been too anxious to try these experiments
without paying any attention to the cautions given out, and I know
of some cases in which, while well remembering that the cautions
had been uttered, persons have pursued these practices by themselves
without assistance.
* * * * *
Discussing so-called “practical yoga” in another place, Mr. Judge
called attention to the fact that the directions found in the
Upanishads, with regard to breathing and postural exercises, should
never be practiced except under the following conditions: (a) a
complete knowledge of all the consequences, with a knowledge of
correctives to be applied when changes take place; and (b) the pos
session of a thoroughly competent guide to point out errors, to
restrain endeavour and to indicate danger, as well as to cure troubles
that ensue.
Yet in the face of all this, and of re-peated warnings, there are
those who will foolhardily begin the practices in complete ignorance.

They do not even pursue the ethical regulations that accompany all
the others, such as the doing away with all vices, bad habits, unchar
itable thoughts and so on; but go in for the practices, merely in the
hope of procuring psychic powers. It is time it were stopped, and
time that those who give out this literature looked into what they
give out to a grasping and stiff-necked generation. That damage
has been wrought cannot be contested, in face of actual experience.
It is well known that these postures, even when ignorantly used,
bring on physiological changes in the body, with great nervous de
rangements.
The need of the West is not for Hatha Yoga, but of that other
and higher discipline, known in the Orient as Raja Yoga. Hatha
Yoga is a practical mortiﬁcation of the body, by means of which
certain powers are developed. Raja Yoga, on the other hand, dis
cards those physical motions, postures and recipes relating solely to
the present personality, and directs the student to virtue and altru
ism as the bases from which to start. Besides the higher objective
presented by Raja Yoga, there is the enormous danger which the
western student exposes himself to by attempting Hatha yogic
development. Even though he may follow rules given by a teacher
more or less informed, he will inevitably arouse about him inﬂuences
that do him harm, and he also carries his natural functions to cer
tain states now and then when he ought to stop for a while, but,
having no knowledge of the matter, may go on beyond and produce
injurious effects. The greatest objection to
it,
however,
is
that
it

PSYCHOLOGY OF THE ANCIENTS
HILE the phenomena and beliefs known today under
the general name of “Spiritualism” are often thought
to be of recent origin, dating back less than one hundred
years, a study of history will show that these abnormal manifesta
tions have been present among all peoples and in all times. Actually,
it would be diﬂicult to ﬁnd an epoch in which psychic phenomena
were not better understood than they are today. Our ignorance of
these matters is due to the materialism of both science and religion,
the one denying the phenomena altogether, the other ignoring them,
or, in the case of the Catholics, making the devil and his ﬁends the
scapegoats for all unnatural events, excepting, of course, the “mira
cles” performed by loyal Christians, which are explained by divine
intervention l
The ancients, however, thought otherwise. Belief in spirits and
invisible worlds, and in the possibility of intercommunication between
men and intelligences existing on other planes was, until quite re
cently in our history, common to all mankind. The religions and
philosophies of the ancients are ﬁlled with allusions to “gods” and
“spirits” of various kinds. The symbolic and legendary accounts of
creation found in the Puranas of India describe an almost inﬁnite
diversity of such beings known by the generic name “Devas.” Their
total number, according to the Hindus, is 330,000,000. H. P.
Blavatsky described them as “the embodied powers of states of
matter, more reﬁned than those with which we are familiar.” While
the term Devas may be rendered “Gods” in English, it must not be
supposed that they are all degrees of being far above man. They
represent the various powers and forces in nature, each class pos
sessing a degree of intelligence, but the kind of intelligence we see
manifested in the various kingdoms.
Personiﬁcation has always been the method of teachers who have
had to deal with the mind of the masses, and hence we ﬁnd tales
of the “Gods” in every land, of beings who have been anthro
pomorphized by the popular imagination, and then worshipped.
The secret teachings of the great religions of the world explain the
inner meaning of these allegories, of which we have a familiar ex
ample in the Mysteries of Greece. St. Paul, in the ﬁrst epistle to the
Corinthians, says, “Know ye not that we shall judge angels,” making
clear that he had been initiated by the Pagan philosophers of his
time. For the angels of Christianity are but the devas of India, the

daimons of Greece, borrowed from the past by the Christian Fathers
and Catholic theologians. Jehovah himself, the personal God of
the Old Testament, was but one of the subordinate powers of Nature,
the tutelary spirit of that great prophet-medium, Moses, whose per
sonal ambition led him to pass off his “familiar” as the very Spirit
of God!
Belief in “spirits”—legitimate because resting on the authority of
experiment and observation—vindicates at the same time another
belief, also regarded as a superstition, namely polytheism. The lat
ter is based on a fact in nature; spirits mistaken for Gods have been
seen in every age by men: hence belief in many and various Gods.
Monotheism, on the other hand, rests upon a pure abstraction. Who
ever saw God?—that God, we mean, the Infinite and the Omni
potent, the one about whom the monotheists talk so much? Poly
theism—when once man claims the right of divine interference on
his behalf—is logical and consistent with the philosophies of the
East, all of which—whether pantheistic or deistic—proclaim the
One to be an infinite abstraction, an absolute Something, which
utterly transcends the conception of the finite. Surely such a creed is
more philosophical than the religion whose theology, proclaiming
God in one place as a mysterious and an incomprehensible Being,
shows him at the same time so human and so petty a God as to con
cern himself with the breeches of his chosen people while neglect
ing to say anything definite about the immortality of their souls or
their survival after death!
The mere presence, however, of doctrines relating to the existence
of invisible beings, or “spirits,” of itself offers little in rational ex
planation of spiritualistic phenomena. Otherwise the blanket charge
of diabolism made by the Roman Catholics such as de Mirville and
des Moisseaux, and more lately by Montague Summers, would
suffice. Actually, there is plenty of evidence to show that the an
cients had knowledge of those many classes of beings which the Spirit
ualists so loosely denominate “spirits of the dead,” that they were in
many cases masters, instead of merely the passive mediums, of the
occult powers. They knew from a profound metaphysical philosophy
and discipline that there are many classes of spirits, some good,
some bad. Of the latter

sorrow . . . and too late. Jakob G0rres, a German author of the
last century, conversing with some Hindus of the Malabar Coast,
asked if there were ghosts among them. They replied that there
were, but recognized them as “bad bhuts,” principally the remains
of suicides and murderers, or of those who died violent deaths. These
spirits ﬂutter about and appear as phantoms. Night-time is favor
able to them, they seduce the feeble-minded and tempt others in a
thousand different ways. (Mystique, iii, 63.)
When Madame Blavatsky told her Hindu friends of the efforts
of European and American Spiritualists to communicate with the
dead they exclaimed in undisguised horror: “Communion with
bhuts—communion with souls that have become wicked demons, to
whom we are ready to offer sacriﬁces in food and drink to pacify
them and make them leave us quiet, but who never come but to dis
turb the peace of families; whose presence is a pollution! What
pleasure or comfort can the Bellate (white foreigners) ﬁnd in com
municating with them ?”
This does not mean that the sages of antiquity disbelieved in
beneﬁcent spiritual inﬂuences, but only that they distinguished
clearly between the material and earthly shades known in the East
as Bhuts or devils, and the purely subjective spiritual intelligences
that work for the elevation and inspiration of mankind. The East
ern teaching, however, is that such communion is possible only after
a long period of extreme discipline, through which the disciple at
tains by successive stages the powers of inner perception which belong
to the adept or initiate. First of all, in this training, the slightest
tendency to passivity must be destroyed. Unless this is done the
aspirant may become the victim of malicious entities which inhabit
the lower psychic atmosphere of the earth. Passivity, note well, is
the sine qua non of successful mediumship, which in the ancient view
exposes the sensitive to the baleful emanations of the lowest of the
invisible spheres.
The Gods or Devas of the Orient were known to the Greeks as
Daimons. Their view of the invisible world and its various inhab
itants was essentially the same as that of the Hindus. In Platonic
philosophy the souls of exalted men were literally “gods,” in that
they participated in the One. In many places Plato shows his famil
iarity with the ancient Aryan philosophy. In the Phaedrus he de
scribes the highest initiation of the Mysteries, whereby one became
the spectator of “entire, simple, immovable, and blessed visions,
resident in a pure light.” The Timaeus gives account of the

mediate between gods and men.” The Bhuts of the Hindus are
identiﬁed in the Phaedo as “ghostly apparitions of souls which have
not departed pure.” Xenocrates, a Platonist who expounded many
of the unwritten theories and teachings of his master, taught that
the Daimons are intermediate beings between the divine perfection
and human sinfulness, and he divides them into classes, each sub
divided into many others. But he states expressly that the individual
or personal Soul is the leading guardian Daimon of every man, and
that no Daimon has more power over us than our own. Thus the
Daimon of Socrates is the God or Divine Entity which inspired him
all his life. It depends on man either to open or close his percep
tions to the Divine voice.
Heracleides, who adopted fully the Pythagorean and Platonic
views of the human Soul, its nature and faculties, speaking of
Spirits, calls them “Daimons with airy and vaporous bodies,” and
affirms that Souls inhabit the Milky Way before descending “into
generation” or sublunary existence.
The fact is that the word Daimon was applied by the ancients, and
especially by the Philosophers of the Alexandrian school, to all
kinds of spirits, whether good or bad, human or otherwise, but the
appellation was often synonymous with that of Gods or angels.
Under the general designation of fairies, and fays, the spirits of
the elements appear in the myths, fables, traditions, or poetry of
all nations, ancient and modern. Their names are legion—peris,
devs, djins, sylvans, satyrs, fauns, elves, dwarfs, trolls, norns, nisses,
kobolds, brownies, necks, stromkarls, undines, nixies, goblins, ponkes,
banshees, kelpies, pixies, moss people, good people, good neighbors,
wild women, men of peace, white ladies——and many more. They
have been seen, feared, blessed, banned, and invoked in every quarter
of the globe and in every age.
These nature-spirits, or elementals, as they have been called, must
not be confused with human ghosts or the psychic remains of those
who have died. Proclus has written explicitly of the “second death,”
by which these remains of the psychic man are left behind:
After death, the soul continueth to linger in the aerial body, till
it is entirely puriﬁed from all angry and voluptuous passions . . . then
doth it put off by a second dying the aerial body as it did the earthly
one. Whereupon, the ancients say that there is a celestial body
always joined with the soul, which is immortal, luminous, and star
like. . . .

like the physical, mortal;
it
is
the psyche, “from ele
ments
it
was formed—to elements
it
must return.” The nous, or
understanding, according to the Greeks,
is
the eternal spirit
in
man.
Plutarch wrote of the fate of the psyche, or lower human soul:
And of these souls the moon
is
the element, because souls resolve
into her as the bodies of the deceased do into earth. Those, indeed,
who have been virtuous and honest, living
a
quiet and philosophical
life, without embroiling themselves in troublesome affairs, are quickly
resolved; being left by the nous and no longer using the corporeal
passions, they incontinently vanish away.
The more coherent of these psychic “corpses,” made so by an
intensity of the passions during life, are the Elementaries of the
Kabalists, the Incubi and Succubi of the Middle Ages. Especially
to be feared were the victims of suicide and sudden death, for whom
the natural terminus of life had not come. Of these the Neoplatonist,
Porphyry, wrote:
The soul, having even after death
a
certain affection for its body,
an affinity proportioned to the violence with which their union was
broken, we see many spirits hovering
in
despair about their earthly
remains; We even see them eagerly seeking the putrid remains of
other bodies, but above all freshly-spilled blood, which seems to
impart to them for the moment some of the faculties of life.
These entities were known to the Romans as “larvae,” or ma
lignant spirits of the dead. Good human spirits became “gods.”
The Roman celebration of Lemuria included rites which were sup
posed to rid the home of lingering shades or shells.
The Magi and theurgic philosophers objected most severely to
necromancy, or the “evocation of souls.” “Bring her [the soul]
not forth, lest
in
departing she retain something,” says Psellus,
a
Neoplatonist of the Byzantine Renaissance. “It becomes you not
to behold them before your body
is
initiated, since, by always allur
ing, they seduce the souls of the uninitiated”—says the same philos
opher in another passage.
The ancients objected to necromancy for several good reasons.
“It
is
extremely difficult to distinguish
a
good Daimon from
a
bad
one,” says Iamblichus. If the spell of
a
good man succeeds
in
pene
trating the density of the earth’s atmosphere—always oppressive to
it,
often hateful—still there

a
danger that
it
cannot avoid; the

out that on “departing, she retains something,” that is to say, she
contaminates her purity, for which she has to suffer more or less
after her departure. The evil terrestrial “Daimons” seek to intro
duce themselves into the bodies of the simple-minded and idiots,
and remain there until dislodged therefrom by a powerful and pure
will. Jesus, Apollonius, and some of the apostles, had the power
(( Y)
to cast out devils, by purifying the atmosphere within and with
out the patient, so as to force the unwelcome tenant to ﬂight.
Although Aristotle himself, anticipating the modern physiologists
and behaviorists, regarded the human mind as a material substance,
he fully believed in the existence of a “double” soul, or spirit and
soul. He laughed at Strabo for believing that any particles of matter,
per se, could have life and intellect in themselves sufficient to fashion
by degrees such a multiform world as ours.
Of the gross terrestrial. shells, Porphyry remarked:
These invisible beings have been receiving from man honours as
gods; . . . a universal belief makes them capable of becoming very
malevolent; it proves that their wrath is kindled against those who
neglect to offer them a legitimate worship.
He said further,
Daimons are invisible; but they know how to clothe themselves
with forms and conﬁgurations subjected to numerous variations,
which can be explained by their nature having much of the corporeal
in itself. Their abode is in the neighborhood of the earth . . . and
when they escape the vigilance of the good Daimons, there is no
mischief they will not dare commit. One day they will employ brute
force; another, cunning. . . .
It is a child's play for them to arouse in us vile passions, to impart
to societies and nations turbulent doctrines, provoking wars, sedi
tions, and other public calamities, and then tell you “that all of these
are the work of the gods.” . . . These spirits pass their time in
cheating and deceiving mortals, creating around them illusions and
prodigies; their greatest ambition is to pass as gods and souls.
Iamblichus, the great theurgist of the Neoplatonic school, and
instructor of Porphyry in sacred magic, wrote in The Mysteries of
the Egyptians that the bad Daimons “manifest themselves but under
the shadowy forms of phantoms.” They “require darkness. . . .
The sensations they excite in us make us believe in the presence and
reality of things they show, though these things be absent.”
A careful reading of Isis Unveiled, supplemented by independent
research into the psychological teachings of the ancient Hindus and
Greeks, cannot fail to show, ﬁrst, the basic uniformities in the de

scriptions of various sorts of psychic phenomena, and, second, the
essential identity of the explanations offered. If the investigator
will make the entirely justiﬁable assumption that the ancients may
have had psychological knowledge, based upon personal experience,
which far transcends our own, such research will undoubtedly lead
him to discoveries that conﬁrm in principle and in many details the
Theosophical teachings regarding these phenomena. It should be
recognized and admitted that while western civilization may have
reached new heights in the ﬁeld of technology and mechanical inven
tion, it is childish and even arrogantly provincial to assume that'a
knowledge of the psychic, intellectual and moral constitution of man,
superior to our own limited understanding in these departments,
could not have existed in the past.
Unless some such recognition is made, and a respectful hearing
accorded to the representations made for the great psychologists
of antiquity, it may well happen that the ﬂood of psychic irregular
ities resulting from the emotional cataclysm of war, and the natural
turning of public interest to things psychic, will deliver millions of
gullible victims into the hands of charlatans and exploiters of the
“psychic.” There is a science of these things, there are principles to
be known, laws to be grasped, and warnings to be issued and ob
served. But that science will never grow from the materialism of
modern psychology, nor from dilettante undertakings in spiritual
ism and “magic” by sophisticated curiosity hunters.
The moral science of psychology has its foundations in a spiritual
conception of man, developed in terms of strict metaphysical prin
ciples, with clear doctrines of the migrations and changes of the
soul in relation to embodied existence. The proofs and tests of that
science are not available to those who refuse to conform to the
ethical precepts on which it is founded, or who will not look in the
direction from which the evidence of its verity is forthcoming. Little
can be done for such as these, nor has the theosophical student any
particular obligation to them. The teachings of Theosophy, whether
as anciently expressed, or in their modern exegesis, are for those who
want them; who, genuinely bewildered by the claims and counter
claims of mediums, pseudo-occultists, and “yogis” from the East,
puzzled by the agnosticism of science, and the apathy of religion,
are determined to find out if there are such things as psychic phe
nomena, and hidden or occult powers in man, and what, if any, may
be the meaning of them all. Theosophy is primarily a philosophy of
life, but it is also practical psychology which comprehends in its pur
view all the strange and inexplicable experiences that come to men.

magazines of the day, and who notes the character of books
being published for popular circulation, that there is a growing
interest in so-called “psychic” subjects. The rigidly materialistic
outlook of yesterday’s science, once regarded by most people as the
ﬁnal authority in all important questions, no longer prevails—a
change in attitude which is as much due to the philosophical, even
mystical, tendencies among leading scientists themselves as to any
thing else. The vast unexplored area of supernormal psychological
powers resident in man is receiving the attention of orthodox scien
tiﬁc investigators, and these workers, while not without their oppon
ents, are slowly gaining the approbation of thoughtful men and
women. Concurrently with these developments in the scientiﬁc and
academic world has come a renascence of popular interest in the
“occult,” the mysterious and the supernatural. Although lacking the
scholarly sanction of modern university authorities, this widespread
attraction to psychic wonders, spiritualistic phenomena and the like
is far more signiﬁcant of the trend of human thought and activity
than the erudite and guarded speculations of a few scientists. Some
broad tendency of human nature is gradually emerging, ﬁnding ex
pression through various channels and at diﬁerent levels of intel
ligence. So numerous are the indications of this change in attitude,
and so far-reaching its eﬁects on modern life, that one is justiﬁed
in proposing the question: Is it mere coincidence that men and
women in all walks of life are turning to the psychic and occult,
whether it be for purposes of religious satisfaction, scientiﬁc inquiry,
or even amusement, or can there be discerned some unifying prin

Perhaps the most telling indication of the supremacy of psychism

dealing with human problems. This we ﬁnd to a startling degree in
recent political events in Europe. Democracy, which is the spirit of
rationalism embodied in government forms, is a thing of the past

oracular and ﬁnal for many millions who have abrogated their right
of independent thinking.
In America, the religious groups which have been most success
ful in gaining adherents in recent years are those which relegate
reason to an unimportant -position in the scheme of moral life.
There
is,
for example, the Oxford Movement headed by Dr. Frank
Buchman. The Buchmanites “talk with God.” God tells them what
to do. This, of course, makes everything very simple, once you
get
a
wire through to the supreme Deity. One need not think for
himself when one has God for his personal daimon. “God has
a
Plan,” say the Oxford enthusiasts, untroubled by the searching
investigations of philosophers who have not as yet been able to
convince either themselves or anyone of intelligence that
a
personal,
thinking and planning “being” can at the same time be omnipresent
and universal-—the highest there is. The ethics of the Oxford
Movement are indeed admirable—Absolute Love, Charity, Honesty,
Truthfulness—but one cannot help remembering that the same
Robespierre who as head of the Committee of Public Safety
in
the
Paris Commune murdered thirty men
a
day, twelve years previously
had retired from the judge’s bench
in
the city of Arras because his
conscience would not permit him to pronounce the sentence of death.
What
if
God’s plan should change? The crusades were one of “His”
designs, and so was the Spanish Inquisition.
What of the hundreds of oriental seers, yogis and “spiritual
teachers” who have invaded the shores of America during recent
years, gaining for themselves immense personal followings? Almost
without exception, their prospectuses read, “Gain health, wealth,
happiness by this new, easy, secret method! Develop your will, your
secret powers, by learning from me!” The emotional exaltation
produced
in
the devotees of these pseudo-spiritual teachers often
ends
in
insanity and

almost beyond repair. The native sages and prophets are not less

PSYCHISM TODAY 4.7
Astrology, Mental Healing, Hypnotism-—these are but a few gen
eral labels to indicate the contents of scores of national magazines
with aggregate circulations running into many millions. The ap
petite of the wonder-seeking psychic is insatiable. Nothing but the
promise of new and more mysterious miracles will satisfy. Gar
nished with terms borrowed from the vocabulary of both science
and religion, often spiced with veiled sex appeal, written in the sen
sational style of yellow journalism, these publications cater to the
most susceptible area of human nature—the psycho-religious hunger
for miracles, for personal salvation, personal power and aggrandise
ment. More insidious than frank prostitution of the body, the pan
derers to psychic intoxication are perverting minds and souls en masse.
There are aﬂinities between these psychic periodicals and the
numerous picture magazines which have recently ﬂooded the coun
try. The latter are essentially “psychic” in character, holding the
attention of the reader through a vivid sense impression instead of
intellectual content. The reading matter is succinct, deﬁnitive, and
impresses the mind of the reader with conclusions which he rarely
questions. No thought is required of the picture-magazine fan; he
sees, is entertained, and he believes. Actually, the picture maga
zines have appropriated a technique carefully developed through
many years of experience by advertising experts. Picture magazines
use the same principles of attention-getting, fascination, and con
version to the “message” of the advertiser that have made fortunes
for so many of these exploiters of the foibles and weaknesses of
human nature—the psychic nature. The methods of the radio ad
vertiser are similar, the only difference lying in the fact that the
impression is auditory instead of visual. The oily, patronizing tones
of the announcers—little better than conﬁdence men who have been
naturalized into respectability by the “bigness” of the business en
terprises they represent, and by the degrading standards of com
mercial honesty which we accept unthinkingly—lull the listeners into
passive acquiescence. It is all so easy, so effortless! Moving pic
tures combine both auditory and visual impressions to make wish
fulﬁllment dreams for the masses. This is Hollywood's contribu
tion to the stultiﬁcation of independent thought in America and else
where. Why should—h0w can—men think, be rational, or survive
as a democratic society, when practically all of their leisure time is
spent in absorbing, like so many psychic sponges, the persuasive and
sensation-producing sights and sounds readily provided by the
“practical” psychologists of this psychic dispensation?

48 CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
A catalogue of the various brands of psychic intoxicants could be
continued indeﬁnitely. The gamut of emotionalism in modern life
includes the familiar exhortations of the revivalist and the respond
ing ecstasy of his listeners; the uninhibited abandon of youthful
swing enthusiasts in their dervish frenzy; the tense appeals of politi
cal partisans arousing the dogs of class hatred, the clamor of unsatis
ﬁed greed, and all the springs of outraged selﬁshness on which the
demagogue depends for his success. Wherever there is human action
based on the instinctive drives of the animal man, on the hunger for
sensations, on the satisfaction of desires without regard for the con
sequences, there is psychism unleashed and enthroned. When the
psychic nature reigns, reason never serves as a check, being called
upon only to justify, to rationalize the ﬁats of the emotions.
What are the consequences of an unregulated emotional life? Of
imagination or fantasy run wild? Of dabbling in “magic,” in spir
itualism and the “occult arts”? Ask a psychiatrist this -question, and,
ignorant as he may be of the realities which these labels conceal, he
will relate horrors that would make the tales of Poe sound like
bedtime stories. A writer in Harper’: recently described our time
as “The Age of Schizophrenia,” of split-personality, so named be
cause of the splitting apart of the emotional from the intellectual life
which characterizes the mental state of literally millions of people.
We learn that “schizophrenic patients occupy one-ﬁfth of all the
hospital beds in the United States, reckoning in general hospital as
well as in mental hospital beds.” Turn to the literature of psychiatry
on the subject of “Obsession,” a term retained from the theories of
obsessing demons believed in in the Dark Ages, and see what -propor
tion of the victims of this kind of insanity are or have been spiritual
ists or mediumistically inclined. Find, if you can, the line between
religious fanaticism and actual madness. In the wake of the visiting
yogis and psychic seers are to be found human beings with emotion
ally shattered lives. They were told that a certain kind of breathing
would bring them knowledge—they would “see things.” They did
the breathing exercises, and now they can't stop seeing things, are
going crazy, or have gone. Others, who thought Hatha Yoga was
“spiritual,” ﬁnd that their organisms break down under the insidious
discipline. In many such cases, insanity may be a blessing in disguise,
deferring until a later incarnation the moral trial which may then
come at a time when the character of the victim has grown stronger
and more able to withstand psychic temptations.
New forms of psychism are evidenced by bizarre new arrivals in
the ﬁeld of religious cults. The newspapers teem with advertise

ments of swamis, yogis and “paramahamsas” who claim to be in
touch with all manner of celestial beings and teachers, whose wisdom
is now for sale, generally on the easy payment basis. Psychic apos
tles vie with one another in their claims of knowing the unknowable,
doing the impossible, and revealing every last secret of the universe.
The more fantastic the claim, the more are attracted as followers,
it appears. We have lately been favored with incarnations of Saint
Germain, Jesus, and George VVashington. From Tibet comes a
“white lama,” formerly of Arizona, who promises to relieve the
sophisticated of their ennui by instruction in Asiatic Mysteries never
before made public. Others join religious with political appeals, and
allege that a corps of statisticians and researchers are now perfect
ing the blueprints for a new “planned” (magic word!) society.
Who can wonder that, a few years ago, when Orson Welles pro
duced a Martian invasion on his radio program, listeners from
Florida to Oregon rushed distractedly about, wondering how to
protect themselves from these horrid visitors out of the sky, and
even a college professor or two went out to look for them some
where in the Jersey meadows!
In I939, Walter Lip-pmann, with a wisdom he could hardly have
himself understood, named the tragic victims of modern psychism
“the spiritual proletariat of the modern age.” They “hear all the
latest news and all the latest opinions, but have no philosophy by
which they can distinguish the true from the false, the credible from
the incredible, the good from the bad.” And, he adds, “the eruption
of their volcanic and hysterical energy is the revolution that is
shaking the world.”
II
Here, in America, a great psychic mutation is under way, the full
developments of which may not disclose themselves for scores of
years. Now, at its outset, little more is visible than the paroxysms
of the decline of an old order, the backwash and carnage of a
world that has lost its sense of legitimate purpose. Modern writers
have habituated themselves to think of this transition in political
terms, founding their judgments of what the future holds on theories
of society which had their beginning in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries. But the change which the human race is entering upon is
more profound by far than any mere political alteration. When it
is complete, new concepts of reality will have emerged and won ac
ceptance, and tomorrow’s social order will have adapted itself to
laws of human relations as yet only guessed at by the few.

5o CYCLES OF PSYCHISM
The biological analogy of “mutation” is a good one, for this
change, according to the Theosophical view, will mark a fundamental
alteration in the inter-relation of the principles of man’s psychic
organism. One of its results will be general recognition that man
is not merely a physical being, but is more essentially an embodied
mind, embodied feelings, hopes, aspirations and desires. These
principles, in the cycle to come, will be acknowledged as the primary
attributes of human beings, and the orbits of scientiﬁc and religious
investigation will thus attain new orientation. But, as with every re
alignment of the evolutionary forces, an epoch of confusion, of false
starts and misguided attempts to anticipate the course of natural
development, will inevitably precede the ﬁnal adjustment of the
race to this new period of human growth and self-expression.
Destruction and failure will seem to be predominant characteristics
of the cycle, and despair the watchword of the many. For those
whose horizons are circumscribed to the past, whose philosophies
are rigidly committed to the old assumptions of western civilization,
the change will seem to mark the “end of the world,” and indeed it
will, for them. Like the dreamer too suddenly awakened from his
slumber, like the miser impoverished by a single miscalculation, like
the child called upon to be and act as a man when he has neither
the knowledge, nor the courage nor the strength, the opening of this
new vista in human aﬁairs will drive many into the current of eﬁlux,
where they will cling to the shattered fragments of the past as the
only symbol they know of the life that was.
But for others, the epoch will be recognized as a mighty challenge
to their moral resources and their self-reliance. The ascending torch
of human intelligence will meet the intenser ﬂame of egoic divinity
in its descent to a more complete participation in the life on earth.
An age of builders will dawn, of educators and healers, without pre
cedent or comparison in the history of present humanity. This is the
message and the prophecy of Theosophy, brought to the world to
lighten the way to the “new order of ages,” and to ease the travail
of its birth.
Hence the warnings, the strict injunctions of the Teacher, H. P.
Blavatsky. She took no morbid delight in spreading a Jeremiad
doctrine of fear and retribution. She but repeated what she knew
of the eternal law of cycles, upraised and proclaimed out of the
lore of the perfected men of the race, whose wisdom and practical
knowledge of cyclic evolution alone can bring humanity through the
terrible dangers of the transition age. Speaking to American theoso

phists of the last century, she told of these dangers, and of the
opportunities for service that are unfolding in the present:
As the preparation for the new cycle proceeds, as the fore-runners
of the new sub-race make their appearance on the American con
tinent, the latent psychic and occult powers in man are beginning to
germinate and grow. . . . Your position as the fore-runners has its
own special perils as well as its special advantages. Psychism, with
all its allurements and all its dangers, is necessarily developing among
you, and you must beware lest the Psychic outrun the Manasic and
Spiritual development. Psychic capacities held perfectly under con
trol, checked and directed by the Manasic principle, are valuable aids
in development. But these capacities running riot, controlling instead
of controlled, using instead of being used, lead the Student into the
most dangerous delusions and certainty of moral destruction. Watch
therefore carefully this development, inevitable in your race and
evolution-period so that it may ﬁnally work for good and not for
evil; and receive, in advance, the sincere and potent blessings of
Those whose good-will will never fail you, if you do not fail your
selves. . . .
Theosophy alone can save the Western world from that selﬁsh
and unbrotherly feeling that now divides race from race, one nation
from the other; and from that hatred of class and social considera
tions that are the curse and disgrace of so-called Christian peoples.
Theosophy alone can save it from sinking entirely into that mere
luxurious materialism in which it will decay and putrefy as civiliza
tions have done. In your hands, brothers, is placed in trust the wel
fare of the coming century; and great as is the trust, so great is
also the responsibility.
There is nothing “evil” or “wicked” in the psychic nature itself.
The evil results from lack of control, from the free indulgence of
desire which, when unleashed and increasingly gratiﬁed, becomes
insatiable in its demands. The more the powers of mind are de
veloped, the more extensive become the responsibilities of man, and
the greater the crimes of which he is capable. Misuse of mental
powers, and here misuse means selﬁsh use, is incalculably more far
reaching in its destructive effects than the abuse of physical powers.
Uncontrol, which is the veritable root of psychism, leads to progres
sive stages of irresponsible exercise of powers, ending in brutal lack
of concern for the welfare of others, if for no other reason than that
the existence of those others has been forgotten during the ever
more engrossing pursuit for satisfaction. The selﬁshness and narrow
partisanships of a civilization founded on material and physical
-powers are as the petty sins of children when compared with the

possible applications of psychic powers for selﬁsh ends during the
cycle to come. A point is reached in the union of desire with intel
lect and the subtler forms of psychic perception, when rationalization
of selﬁshness becomes absolute. This is the death of all morality,
and the beginning of a deliberate career in evil for evil’s sake. The
only protection against such a fate for the human race is the practice
of moral discipline, and the study of Theosophy, the philosophy
which will convince mankind that such discipline is both necessary,
just and desirable. Comprehensive grasp of the hidden laws of
nature, even intellectually, is not possible without thorough investi
gation of the Theosophical teachings as a whole.
For example, the cyclic character of psychic manifestations is de
pendent on the Theosophical teaching of the three lines of evolution,
and the successive emphasis which the course of human development
places upon the principles involved in these divisions. A passage
from the Ocean of Theosophy will illustrate:
We ﬁnd Theosophy teaching that at the present point of man's
evolution he is a fully developed quaternary with the higher principles
partly developed. Hence it is taught that to-day man shows himself
to be moved by passion and desire. This is proved by a glance at the
civilizations of the earth, for they are all moved by this principle,
and in countries like France, England, and America a gloriﬁcation of
it is exhibited in the attention to display, to sensuous art, to struggle
for power and place, and in all the habits and modes of living where
gratiﬁcation of the senses is sometimes esteemed the highest good.
But as Mind is being evolved more and more as we proceed in
our course along the line of race development, there can be perceived
in all countries the beginning of the transition from the animal pos
sessed of the germ of real mind to the man of mind complete. This
day is therefore known as the “transition period,” when every system
of thought, science, religion, government, and society is changing, and
men’s minds are only preparing for an alteration. Man is not yet
fully conscious, and reincarnations are needed to at last complete the
incarnation of the whole trinity (the higher, spiritual man) in the
body. When that has been accomplished the race will have become
as gods.
The mysteries of psychic phenomena are to be accounted for by
the as yet imperfect incarnation of mind, which is a progressive de
scent, and which re-quires a corresponding aspiration and striving on
the part of mankind. It is because the full powers of mind are not
yet active in the race that the scientist is wandering in the dark, con
founded and confused by all that hypnotism and other strange things
bring before him. Because these powers are withheld until the appro

last century, the ﬂood tide of psychism broke loose over the American
continent. But, as in each cycle more and more of the higher powers
of man will become accessible, greater knowledge, and power, too,
will become possible. Finally, with full power and responsibility,
with minds fully illuminated, all men will be compelled to choose
between good and evil ways, the one leading to heights of spiritual
achievement in the common brotherhood of man, the other path,
dark with selﬁshness, to moral ruin.
Writing in 1893, William Q. Judge expressed the hope that “by
the time the next tide begins to rise, the West will have gained some
right knowledge of the true philosophy of Man and Nature, and
be then ready to bear the lifting of the veil a little more.” That tide
is now upon us, and to help on the progress of the race to a better
knowledge of psychic evolution—its extraordinary promise, if un
derstood, for the good of mankind, and its terrible dangers, if al

pamphlet.
