      				  					Grief Healed: A Physician's Guide to Dealing with Grief and Thriving. Check it out at:&nbsp; Click Here

   Please read my book: 'Grief Healed: A Physician's Guide to Dealing with Grief and Thriving', to understand more about the Spiritual events that occurred with my husband and son's deaths. There were many warnings I received before my husband's death, that I chose to ignore because I did not want to give it thought and 'make it happen.' Stupid me! Later on, I realized God/Higher Power/Universe was warning me about what was to happen. This is because at the same time I had a young son, who was fighting death. He had widespread bone cancer. He ultimately died within 10 months of his father. So, lots of stories in this book about listening to our Inner Voice.

  *******************

  I was visiting my relatives in India, and I was in Mumbai, visiting my grand uncle for a day. It was late at night, and I had come back from a wedding. So, I went to take a shower. All my life, I had always taken a bucket bath at his house. This is where you fill a bucket of hot water. And you fill another bucket of cold water. Then you sit on a stool in the bathroom and mix the two according to the water temperature you want and pour water on yourself. This is very typical in India.

  This year my grand uncle had installed a shower. So, I was taking a shower for the first time in his house. I tend to take VERY HOT SHOWERS. The problem is the bathroom was very small, it did not have any windows for ventilation, nor was there a fan. But it has always been this way all my life and I never thought anything about it.

  I turned on the hot water. Minutes into the shower, I started getting very weak and tired. I was perplexed. In the US, when I take HOT showers, very rarely I start getting a bit light=headed. I know this is from too hot showers. I turn off the shower then and I lie down on the bed with my feet elevated. I am back to normal within a couple of minutes.

  But this was not the same. I was getting weaker and weaker. It was like my arms and legs were turning to jelly. I could hardly hold myself up. I was bewildered. It was so quick--from being perfectly fine and then two minutes later feeling like I would pass out.

  I was getting weaker and weaker and trying to comprehend what was happening when I heard a voice telepathically TELL me, 'SIT DOWN RIGHT NOW AS SLOWLY AS YOU CAN!'. I saw an image that if I did not do what the voice asked, I would fall down on the hard cement floor, crash my skull, and bleed to death.

  There was NO SECOND-GUESSING this voice. I switched off the shower and I did my best to try and sit gently on the floor. I had become so weak by then that I fell to the floor. I tried to put my head down gently, but the muscles were too weak, and my head banged on the floor. I felt the impact and the initial pain.

  But then INSTANTLY, I was taken up into LIGHT. It was almost like an escalator, but much more upright. So, instead of a 45 degree angle, it was almost 85 degrees. I was going up, up, up.

  I WAS THRILLED and in awe. I knew I was dying. And I didn't care. I had read SO MUCH about NDEs on the NDERF website for the past few years that I KNEW I was dying. There was no pain, nothing. If anything, I was THRILLED I was going to meet my son.

  Both my husband and son had died a few years earlier, within 10 months of each other. My husband had been 48 years old. But my son had just turned 18 years. A mere baby. I was so excited to meet him.

  As I was going up this rather upright escalator, it occurred to me now that I am dead, who would take care of my daughters? I had two daughters who were 20 and 21 years old. 'Naw,' I thought, 'they would be just fine. My new husband would take care of them.' And so, I had no worried and was merrily going up to meet my son.

  All I can remember at this point is that I did meet him, and my husband, who was in the background because I really wanted to talk to my son more than anybody else. And we talked for three hours. 

  I know it is three hours because my cousin, who was also at the house, realized that after 45 minutes I still had not come out of the bathroom. Perplexed, she knocked on the door. No reply. She tried to open the door. But these doors of yore are built so strong you would need an elephant.

  Scared, she had run to the neighbors. They tried to open the door, to no avail. Frantically, she ran out on the streets to try and get anybody to help her. Someone found a locksmith after another house. They came to the house. With a lot of hammering and banging, they were finally able to break down the door.

  They found me blabbering incoherently. From my end, I was so upset I was dragged back into this body. I heard them banging on the door outside calling my name. I kept saying, 'Leave me along. Don't bother me. I want to be left alone. I don't want to come back.'

  In any case, they opened the door. I was lying naked in a puddle of poop, to put it frankly. I was semi-coherent. They walked me to a bedroom, and I zonked out.

  My cousin and her parents assumed I just fell asleep in the bathroom. They think I always run around too much when I am in India, and they yelled at me for days after that that I never rest.

  However, I passed out. The next day, I woke up very pasty. I was still weak. I also noticed that my heart was beating erratically.

  I thought about possibly going to a doctor. But I had no idea how to do this in India and I did not want to bother my 90+ year old granduncle. My cousin was just hell-bent I fell asleep from exhaustion.

  I felt better and better as the next few days went on. I felt stronger, my skin color reverted back to its normal, and I was not tired. But I did notice my heart skipping for a few weeks.  

  Background Information:       

  Gender:   	Female  

  Date NDE Occurred:   	 12/2016  

  NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes         Carbon Monoxide poisoning  Other Unofficially dead for 3 hours

  I was visiting India from the US for a wedding. One day, I was taking a hot shower in my grand uncle's house in Mumbai. There is something I now realize called 'Gas Geyser Syndrome' that occurred. A lot of people in India still use gas because electricity is too expensive and too erratic. Gas also heats hot water faster. Unfortunately, gas geysers emit various toxic gases; one among them is colorless, odorless carbon monoxide (CO). In the past few years, there have been tons of reports of unexplained loss of consciousness in the bathroom. 

  In addition, most of the bathrooms are small and unventilated, as was the one I was in. So I passed out from carbon monoxide poisoning.  

  How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      No    I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal   Well, I was so zoned in to meeting my son, that really that was all I thought about. But I had enough clarity to worry temporarily about my daughters and who would take care of them now that I died.  

  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         As I went into the light.  

  Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     There was no concept of time. It just WAS. It was NOW.  

  Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I could see myself going up into the light. Nothing comes close to the joy and love and peace and bliss that one feels going up like this.  

  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I was so enthralled at meeting my son, that was my only focus. If anything, my hearing was dulled to the outside world.  

  Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain     Sort of. It was more like an 85 degree elevator with light. So, yes, I would say that was a tunnel.  

  Did you see any beings in your experience?         I actually saw them  

  Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes     I saw my son and my husband. My husband was there but he was in the background but it was really my son I wanted to be with and talk to.  

  Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

  Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   White light. I was going up in it.  

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     Again, I was taken up in light and surrounded by light.  

  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Excitement, Bliss, Love, Pure Happiness.  

  Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

  Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

  Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         No       

  Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

  Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No     

  God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Hindu   Even though I am born a Hindu, I believe in all religions. I call my self 'Spiritual' vs Religious. This has always been the case since I was old enough to understand religions.  

  Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

  What is your religion now?         Hindu   Even though I am born a Hindu, I believe in all religions. I call myself 'Spiritual' vs Religious. This has always been the case since I was old enough to understand religions.  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I have read SO MUCH about NDEs that I knew I was dying. And I was thrilled. So it correlated exactly with my readings. I was only terribly bummed that I had to come back WITH NO KNOWLEDGE whatsoever of the conversations that occurred with my son.  

  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         No       

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

  Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

  Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

  During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Uncertain     I got told a lot of things but I DO NOT REMEMBER ANY OF THEM! So sad.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Uncertain     Well, yes, because I was taken up by LIGHT. And my son and husband were all light like me but I know who they were. So, there is a oneness to all of us.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No     I was taken up into the LIGHT. I can only  

  Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

  During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     I saw my husband and son, both of whom had died a few years earlier.  

  Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Uncertain     Not really given any specific information, but when I got taken into light, it was just pure love.  

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         No changes in my life     I can only say that I have gotten more intuitive, getting messages about certain things from the other side.  

  Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

  After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  This is clear as day.  

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I definitely have answers given to me. For example, a cousin was almost about to get engaged to a girl. I was told, 'They will break up.' There was absolutely NO reason for this. Both parties were good and seemed to care about each other. Sure enough, within a few days, the whole relationship was off. Many similar things such as these have happened after the NDE.  

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Well, the problem is ALL MY CONVERSATION got erased. So, I cannot answer this question.  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I share it with everyone. Most people think I am nuts but I know what happened and I really don't care what they think. I only share to tell people we never die. Our souls are ever alive. And to give those whose loved ones have died, hope.  

  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   Oodles. For hours on end, before my NDE, I read NDE stories on your awesome website (NDERF).  

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     Oh, it was definitely real. I saw my son. I experienced the Happiness seeing him. I know he is just fine. I just cannot recollect the conversation.  

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     As above, it was definitely real. I saw my son. I experienced the Happiness seeing him. I know he is just fine. I just cannot recollect the conversation.  

  At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         It was a BEAUTIFUL feeling going up into the LIGHT and seeing my loved ones.  

  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I feel it was done very well.
