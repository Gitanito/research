            		Experience Description:   

I was driving down a road, when someone crossed into my lane, hit me head-on. I heard the glass braking, then felt myself drifting upward, I could see, and saw my body in the car. People were shaking my body or me, I could not feel anything, and I could see the accident. I could not speak, could not hear, and had not thought of what was happening - just see and felt void. I saw a light shining, I stopped drifting upward, like I was just hovering over the accident, looking down, people kept shaking me, my body, but I felt at peace, I had no worries, just could see everything, that's all. Then I awoke in my body, still had no pain, or injuries, but began to feel confused, wondering what had just happened to me. I knew I was involved in an accident, but wondered what happened during that time. My hair began to fall out, bunches of it at time, and I kept thinking about it for a long time, until I began to have special knowledge of things, then know what really happened to me. My life was spared for a good reason, to help others, and now that is what I do for a living, I am a Mental Health Professional (Mental Health Rehabilitation Tech-C).
