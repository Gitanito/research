  		              		Experience Description   

    I went to the Venetian Pool with my foster parents at the time, one of their daughters, and my brother and sister. I was in the water holding on to the edge of the pool, moving around the pool with my hands. At a point near to where my family was present outside of the pool, my hands slipped from the edge where I was holding on. I fell straight to the bottom. The pool was about 8 feet at that point. I initially tried to go to the surface but couldn't. 

After a while I felt very much at peace, content. I had the feeling that everything outside of where I was did not have any  meaning, i.e., everything was meaningless and pointless - and an illusion. I had absolutely nothing to worry about. I floated above the pool. I could see the tops of the umbrellas that were in the middle of the tables. I saw my sisters. Then I saw my older brother walk to the edge of the pool. I could tell the moment when he realized that I was drowning. I heard him call out that I was drowning. I saw him dive in to get me. 

The most prominent memory has always been that I did not want him to save me. I wanted to stay in the peaceful place. I could not understand why he would take me from such a great place, back to a world that had not been very good to me up to that point. I remember coming to consciousness by the side of the pool. The biggest effect this experience has had on my life is that it has made me careless, sometimes reckless. I have not feared death since then. This has caused me to take risks, and I have had to learn to control my impulses.

What is your religion now?         Unaffiliated- Nothing in particular- Secular unaffiliated   I do not participate in any organized religious. I have my own spiritual beliefs.  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I was too young to have such beliefs, so I really can't answer this question.

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     At the time of my experience I was 7 years old. I was already pretty fearless. I probably would have outgrown that much more if not for the experience. I have had problems in my life related to apathy, feeling as this is all an illusion, not caring, not worrying about my health. I have no special desire to live to an old, old age. I love my life, am happy with it but I've more or less been resigned that in the scheme of things whatever happens - happens.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain     It's hard to tell what it was like before because I was so young. But I've always been intuitive and often know what's going to happen next before it happens.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          I did not want to come back. But there must be a reason why I was saved. Therefore, I must have a purpose.
