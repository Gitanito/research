  		              		Experience Description   

    I woke up with a headache, so I took two pills. 
  
  I then went to work, which is one and  a half miles from my house through some double-S  bends where many  accidents occur.   I went into  the wrong lane an ended up against the curb.  I tried to steer  away from the curb  for about 5 seconds.

  Then, I felt like I wasn't in my body. I was  in  blackness but with hundreds  of sparkly lights.  I was a little scared because I could see my hunched-up body and  knew that I'd passed over.  To my left  and in a field, there were many  people. I saw  my grandma  and her sister who had passed in the previous year. The colours were so vivid! In front of me was a medium-sized stream with a white bridge over it. Jesus was standing on the other side of the bridge.  There was   a huge, sunlight OBJECT shining down on his left side. But it didn't hurt me to look at it. 

  Meanwhile,  a man stopped and ran over to my body. He cradled my head in his lap, telling me to wake up. 

 I heard in my head, Jesus asking me, 'Gary, would you like to stay for eternal peace and happiness or go back?" I thought, 'I'd like to go back.' I floated straight back into my prone body while the gentleman was still rocking me.

  What was your religion prior to your experience?   Atheist

  What is your religion now?   No answer.
  
  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I was a young atheist, not believing in anything. But seeing what I did in my experience changed everything

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I did discover healing afterwards. But having seen spirit since the age of 10, I consider it normal.  
  
  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Knowing that there's no such thing as death.  Seeing my two relatives   and seeing Jesus.  
  
  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes     I only started to tell people if ghosts or anything spiritual came up in conversation. This was after reading Elizabeth Taylor's experiences of her NDES. At the time, I  would only explain it to  those who had NDEs  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     Wow.
