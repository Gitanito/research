EXPLANATORY INTRODUCTION.
Tri order to make the following pages perfectly com*
prehensible, it may be necessary for uoe to state, that all the
, references to the respective books are numbered as in the
following catalogue.
f
In the Index reference, the figures shewing the number
of the book and the page will follow the article; as for ex*
amplet—
4‘ The great A line he cannot read,” 8, 103—11, 4.
The first numbers represent the first book and page, and
the following numbers after the dash (—) the other book
thus—the 8, 103, signifies the 8th book, 103d page, and
the ll, 4, the 11th book and 4th page, and so on where
any numbers follow the first. t ,"^x /„ ... v -y
When several pages in one book are referred to, as under
the article Adam—“ Christ compared to the second Adam,”
6, 277—8, 74— 11, 106—14, 63— 16,50—21; 20,30—65;
5, 10, 20—shews that the quotation is taken from the 6th
book, 277th page, and that it is repeated in the 8th book,
74th page—11th book, 106th page— 14th book, 65th page—
16th book, 50th page—21st book; 20tb and 30th pages—
the 63th book, 3th, ioth, and 20th pages, and in a similar
manner the numbers will be given when the article is
repeated in one and more books and pages.
The scripture quotations have the number of the book
from whence taken for the first number, the chapter for the
second number, then the verse or verses, and the last num­
ber is the page of the book in which it is printed. When
the same chapter and verse occurs in more than one book,
as for example, after the first chapter of Genesis given in
the first line, the following line shews that it is likewise t»
be found in 43, 23—57, S3—62,10—that is, in the 43d book
23d page—57th book, 83d page, and 62d book, 10th page;
for in all references of this kind the first number refers to
the book, and the second to the page, and in like manner for
any others, where a repetition in the subsequent ljse if
/
When it may be necessary to abbreviate a word, the title
of the article will be printed in an italic letter; as for ex-
mple, c. for communications; w. for writings, 6$c. and after
the article eluc. for elucidation—exp. for explained, and
ans. for answered; Wilt occasibndlly be printed.
For the sake of comprising a great quantity of matter in
a small compass, I have omitted all the references to the
scripture elucidations; the Reader will therefore be'pleased
jto attend to the scripture Index for the portions he may be
desirous to Examine, and refer to the respective books for aq
explanation, as it would have taken several extra numbers
to contain the articles that are there most'Divinely elucidated
by the Spirit of Truth: and if they were to mark the num­
ber of the book and page opposite the texts in their Bibles*
it would afford them great assistance in having an immediate
reference and connection with the books.
I would also recommend those who have complete sets,
to mark them in the margin with the numbers referred to in
the Index, immediately opposite the respective parts tb&t
are similar, explanatory, or connected ; and thereby form a
complete marginal reference; like those in the Bible; by
which means they will be enabled to compare and examine
them with the scriptures, weigh the whole together, draw
the link, lengthen the chain; see if one fink will join with
another,coinpare the whole together,see if it add9 link to link,
;chain to chain, like the dawning morning, higher and higher,
brighter and brighter, to the perfect day: or like a flower in
the bud, openiug more and more, until the full blown flower
appears. In this manner we must weigh the works of God ;
like the husbandman’s seed, first thrown into the earth, and
-buried down without any appearance of seed till you see the
.blade appear; then cometh the stalk, next the ear, then the
blossom, and then the grain is lit for harvest. Just so we
must mark the rising of all things that come from God.
Zondottf February 2 l, 1815.
