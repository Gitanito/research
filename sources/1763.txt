THE AGE OF TREASON

THE WARNING
You and your loved ones are at this very moment
confronted by the greatest menace to health
and sanity ever known to mankind.
Imagine yourself if you can, BECOMING CONSCIOUS that
you are gradually losing your manhood; that your mind is
rapidly deteriorating so that you are no longer capable of think-
ing clearly; unable to plan your future actions.
Your resistance is becoming so weakened that you are no
longer master of yourself. In short, you are rapidly developing
into a moron, a robot, a zombie, readily subject to the dictates
of others and that your family is faring no better.
"A madman's dream you say! The nightmare conjured
up by fear mongers!" Is it?
Following directly after this Warning there is repro-
duced page 50 of the 1953 edition of Bertrand Russell's book:
THE IMPACT OF SCIENCE ON SOCIETY. Russell here offers
Pitches outline of methods to be followed to bring about this
deterioration of man. HE DESCRIBES METHODS THAT HAVE
BEEN EMPLOYED, AND ARE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED RIGHT
HERE IN AMERICA FOR THE PURPOSE STATED. Neither Pitche
nor Russell stated that they agreed with this procedure to reduce
the race to a state lower than the animals of the field, but
they did suctintly and in a few words outline the procedure that
might be followed, METHODS NOW BEING EMPLOYED.
AROUSE YOURSELF TO A RECOGNITION OF THE FACT
THAT, ACCORDING TO THOSE SO ENGAGED, THESE PLANS
HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TRIED ON MILLIONS OF HUMAN BE-
INGS, FIRST IN EUROPE AND NOW IN AMERICA.

In this volume he quoted Fitcbe, first visioning the methods

INTRODUCTION
Whether or not we liU it, whether or not they
deserve it, in order to save ouTselves, we
must help others to save themselves.
INTERRELIANCE IS THE ETERNAL LAW
The outstanding reason for the preparation and publica-
tion of the first edition of THE AGE OF TREASON, as it is
for the present volume, was the frank statement in Bertrand
Russell's, 1953 edition, of his THE IMPACT OF SCIENCE ON
SocIETY.
In this volume he quoted Fitche, first visioning the methods
to be pursued for MENTAL DEGENERATION OF THE WHITE
RACE, as well as Russell and others who followed them.
It is exuemely doubtful if Fitche endorsed the idea or the
methods to be pursued, and though Russell is a profound Social-
ist, it is questionable if he agreed with the methods outlined to
bring about the demoralization of man in preparation for his
enslavement. The kindest conclusion is that both foresaw the
horrors to be visited upon mankind.
Russell is taken more seriously than many other writers.
He has been accepted by the Intelligentsia everywhere, largely
because he was a winner of the Nobel prize, as also for his posi-
tion in favored Universities.
There is another and important reason for publishing this
work: the fact that we know from experience and investigation,
the horrible things even now being visited upon thousands of
helpless individuals here in the U. S. These are faces the public
should know.
An ever increasing number of requests come to us from
every section of the counuy, urging a thorough investigation,
plus the rendering of an unbiased opinion based on the knowl-
edge gained by such an investigation, describing as accurately

as possible, the destructive and debasing practices already in
vogue, plus the plans for the future to be employed by certain
cliques to assure compliance with the edicts of small but power-
ful groups to bring about the complete destruction of our
society as it presently exists.
These requests, in general, have one source:
During World War I, many patriotic men and women
associated themselves into an organization known as THE
HUMANITARIAN SOCIETY1 for the purpose of human welfare,
instructions in food substitutes, and aid wherever needed. This
organization was later (following the passage of a Law for
this purpose) registered in Pennsylvania.
Those who became associated with this group, though
from every section of the country, were, by their very nature
and inclinations, "grass root" Americans. That is, they were
imbued with the original uncontaminated American Spirit:
They believed in the American flag as the only flag
symbolizing individual freedom.
They believed whole-heartedly in America. They
were heart and Soul Nationalists.
They believed unquestionably in the American Con-
stitution as spiritually and divinely inspired; as an instru-
ment for human freedom, irrespective of race or creed,
with every individual free as families are free, permitting
no interference one with the other.
1 To convey an idea of the "body" of the Humanitarian
Society, we compare its functional form, with high regard, to the
Christopher Society. Though it possibly antedates that society,
it is in almost every respect, comparable in organization — or lack
of organization to that of the Christophers. Anyone who is in full
harmony with the tenets of the Society and willing to aid in its
work to inform and aid the mass, may become members, without
obligation. There are no entrance fees, no dues. Cooperation is
the only law.

They believed in the educational system then in
vogue as the most perfect in the world, basing their con-
clusions on the number of great men that were the fruit
of the system.
They believed firmly and unquestionably in God, the
Divine Law, and man's subjection to it.
Following the war, the association became more or less
loosely knit, with contacts less regular. These men and women
never gave up their ideals, and what is of as great importance,
they raised their children in these basic principles so that the
generations that followed them continued as fundamentally,
though by no means exclusively, Christian; Constitutional and
Nationalistic Americans; and these, despite their silence, number
millions today. Many of them are watching with mounting
fear the ever-changing events and the constantly increasing en-
croachment upon their personal rights, which had its beginning
even before the first world war. These Americans some years
ago, as in the past when important issues arose, requested us
to investigate and to help in the manner we did their parents.
The problem of greatest concern to them, as it should be
to every American, is the clearly outlined plans for the sub-
jugation by mental demoralization and degeneration of the mass
(all but the few) by the demonic methods described by Bertrand
Russell (see reproduction of page 50) in his THE IMPACT OF

seriousness of the practices and intentions of the enemies of

The better informed public at large who had read much
of the literature on the methods at that time in practice, was
becoming panic stricken by the fear that these consciousless
and Soulless agents would not be content with the methods
they were using, but would discover other and perhaps more
horrible means to carry out their plans.
Complying with the many requests to undertake the out-
lined investigation, we made numerous lengthy trips through-
out America and the first volume of THE AGE OF TREASON
was the result.
When we accepted the assignment, we did so with the
expressed proviso:
That whatever the results of our investigations, we would
not indulge in personal and individual recrimination, name
calling, and/or defamation of character of any nature.
2 In the first edition of The Age of Treason, all of the dia-
bolical methods recounted by Russel on Page 50 and 51 of his
book The Compact of Science on Society, were dealt with. Since
then, the subject has become far too large to be properly con-
sidered in one volume. In the present volume: Your Health and
Sanity — The Age of Treason, we will deal only with foods and
liquids, the two things man must have to live, and the methods
now being followed in adulterating both with Toxic, Cancer and
other disease creating additives. Another volume to follow:
The Age of Treason, will expose and deal exhaustively with the
many methods now being practiced to degenerate the minds of
men into those of morons and imbeciles, that the victims may
be readily controlled.

THE AGE OF TREASON 13
We did not, and do not, believe in this form of character
assassination. We feel that this has become so common that
when an intelligent, educated, reasoning person reads of the

TIlE AGE OF TREASON 13
We did not, and do not, believe in this form of character
assassination. We feel that this has become so common that
when an intelligent, educated, reasoning person reads of the
commission of an almost incomprehensible and treasonable
action, coupled with all manner of villification, his conclusion
and reactions are: The writer has "an axe to grind." He is
also conscious of the fact that those who do not belong to
favored "cliques," but labor for the welfare of humanity, will
be villified and persecuted: hence it was agreed that however
guilty of wrong any person might be, the act, NOT THE PERSON,
would be exposed and condemned.
It was also understood that whenever possible, we would
avoid offering our personal opinion or reaction of any occur·
ence, act, or affair. We would simply quote those who made
reports, who had investigated or exposed methods practiced,
giving them full credit. Our conclusions would be voiced only
after a careful analysis, and full consideration based upon OUR
OWN ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE AS A RESULT OF PERSONAL EX-
PERIENCE, and then leave it to the reader to STUDY, THINK,
REASON, INVESTIGATE, AND ARRIVE AT THE TRUTH; AND
ACT AS A MAN SHOULD.
SPECIFICALLY, our desire from the very beginning of our
effores had, and still has, but one objective: THE WELFARE OF
OUR FELLOW MAN. If we can succeed in awakening our
true Americans to their great danger, our aim has been
achieved, if not, it is recognized that every man has free Will,
and the right and opportunity to either save or damn himself.

Some of the writers quoted and accepted as authorities
throughout the world, are positive in their statements. As for
ourselves, we prefer to imply, rather than to claim, that IT is
so. We feel that by doing this we will avoid antagonism even
among those who feel as we do, and our conclusions will be the
more readily accepted.
It is our contention that he who knowingly permits an-
other, even though that other be his enemy, to be misled, or
harm to come upon him or upon those dear to him, is a traitor
to his fellow man, his country and to his God. He is guilty of
treason.
So great has become the momentum of treason to the
American people that even many of those in the highest posi-
tions whose duty it is to protect the American people, and who
by taking the oath of their office should be the intermediary
between the citizens and God in dispensing justice, have fla-
grantly betrayed their trust, actually turning over the citizens
to the enemy.

ton as in his own city, after reading the text of the present vol-

every American still filled with pride in his race, his manhood,

Old-fashioned and long followed methods are frequently

castrating male calves so that they would grow into steers whose
meat is so much more tender and desirable than it would be if
the calf were permitted to grow into a bull.
The secondary effect of this operation, and this is highly
important in the plan followed by the destroyers of mankind,
is that it will have a profound effect upon the nature of the
animal; CASTRATION DESTROYING ITS FEROCITY, HENCE, ITS

There was also the long practiced method of caponizing
male chickens so that they became abnormal females in nature;
the comb, most prominent male characteristic, failing to de-
velop; the flesh becoming tender, with nothing left of the bird's
natural "cockiness" of self-defending, or fighting qualities.ll

actually cause tumors of the breast and uterus, these in turn
becoming malignant, turning into cancer. It is a dangerous
medicinal agent in other than experienced hands.
At the present time it is estimated that more than half of

is no accurate estimate of the number of beef cattle receiving
it in their feed. This substance is not entirely eliminated from
the flesh of the animals so fed before slaughtering, nor by the
preparation of the meat for human consumption. It is stored
more abundantly in the liver and is doubly dangerous to those
suffering from anemia who use liver more abundantly in the
belief that liver will build blood.
That there is real danger in the consumption of such meats
by human beings was early recognized. It became so apparent
that an investigating committee was formed in America, known
as the DELANEY COMMITTEE who, according to their reports,
found that the amount of the substance in the bodies of chickens
was 20 times the amount a reputable physician would prescribe
for his patient, and only if under bis constant supervision.

If a physician were to prescribe a Toxic drug of which he
possessed little or no knowledge, such drug causing temporary
or permanent physical injury to the patient, and it became
known to the victim, he would be subject to suit for damage.
It is certain that no reputable, experienced physician would
at any time or in any instance, prescribe such a drug en masse,
especially not for reasons of profit. Nevertheless the raisers of
animal stock for food, and the processors of such foods are per-
mitted, without a semblance of knowledge or license, to do so.
Such practice being almost universal now, what is to be the
verdict for those who practice such mass medication with Toxic
drugs by feeding such drugs to animals to be slaughtered for
human consumption, by old and young, well or ill, where
such drugs are as counter indicated as is Stilbestrol.
It is the duty, a sacred one of the physician, to protect the
life and welfare of the people as a whole. If he does not, he is
a traitor to his profession. It is also the duty of parents to protect
the welfare of their children. It is equally the duty of the pro-
ducer of food substances to make every effort that all food for

not criminal by act, and guilty of treason as a result of harm
done, and is this not a crime against humanity, the State, and
God?

When given or injected where
the indications for it are not present, it may cause cancer and
other abnormal conditions of mind and body, and BE ESPE·
CIALLY DETRIMENTAL TO CHIILDREN AND YOUTHS.
The Stilbestrol mixed with the feed for animals is syn-
thetic and is far more potent than the natural made from gravit
mare's urine. More and more experienced physicians are begin-
ning to believe that this synthetic preparation, even when pre-
scribed WHERE IT IS INDICATED, IS THE CAUSE OF TUMORS OF
THE BREAST AND UTERUS, THESE TUMORS FREQUENTLY
TURNING INTO CANCER.

"Bishop points out that the matter of dosage is of
great importance for at least three reasons: (1) High
estrogen dosage renders the organism less sensitive to sub-

continued high dosage gives rise to endometrial changes,

hemorrhages. (3) Prolonged inhibition of pituitary activ-

eners, sweeteners, preservatives and the like were labeled
cancer producing today by a symposium of the interna-
tional union against cancer.
"Other food additives were put on a suspect list as
unsafe until their properties had been more thoroughly
tested.
"The cancer experts meeting in Rome acknowledged
that this created 'a serious public health problem: They
unanimously recognized the 'urgent necessity of inter-
national collaboration for the protection of mankind'
against such hazards as cancer producing food additives.
"The participants in the symposium also acknowl-
edged that food additives were only one part of the vast
problem of environmental cancer, which includes occupa-
tional and lung cancers.
"The symposium was attended by forty-two cancer
experts from twenty-one countries including seven Ameri-
cans and four Russians. It was called by the congress of
the International Union against cancer held in Sao Paulo,
Brazil.
Report Subjed to Review
"The joint report unanimously adopted by the sym-
posium is subject to review by the executive Committee of
the International Union Against Cancer. It is, therefore,
possible that some of its conclusions may be modified.
"The report laid down the basic principle that no
food additives should be used unless specifically permitted
by legislation based on lists of substances that have been
proved innocuous after stringent laboratory tests.
"It went on to give the first lists of food preservatives
and dyes that were found either acceptable, dubious, or
definitely dangerous. Dubious preservatives requiring
urgent retesting included, sulphureous acid and its derivi-
ties and formic acid.

"The dangerous preservatives condemned as 'car-
cinogenous and to be avoided for human use' included
thiourea, tioacetamide, eight-hydroxy, quinoline and hydro-
quinone. Most and perhaps all of these are used in the
United States and Europe.
"The report said certain mineral oils and paraffines
used for coating milk containers 32 had produced cancer in
man and experimental animals. It issued a warning against
food stuffs sterilized by radiation as potential cancer haz-
ards and against the use of estrogens33 as fattening agents
for poultry and meat animals.
"It said that several detergents had 'co-carcinogenous
and prompting effects' and that their use for cleaning food
containers therefore required caution.
Food Dyes Condemned
"Food dyes came in for particular severe condemna-
tion from the symposium. Its report stated that no food
dye at present met 'agreed criteria or safety.' Twenty-nine
dyes were listed as 'unsuitable' or 'potentially dangerous'
with the statement that they should on no account be
added to food or drink for men and animals.

added to the feed for cattle and sometimes fowls. According to
the best authorities it is not destroyed by heat in the preparation

was delayed several months due to the serious illness of the

That additive is Stilbestrol.
We quoted universally known physicians acquainted with
the proper use of this substance, as well as with the danger of
its use even in the hands of experienced physicians.
Now, a year later, we find that the NATIONAL POLICE
GAZETTE in its February, 1958 number, devotes an article to
the same important subject from the standpoint of its danger to
the health of those who consume the meat of animals fed this
Toxic subject in the feed, or as in the case of fowl, inoculated
with it.
This problem of health is important, but not by any means

the National Cancer Institute of the United States Health
Service. . . .
"There is nothing wrong with eating meat. The

—partly due to ineffective laws3—to prevent food manu-
facturers and meat producers from putting dangerous

that are mixed with the feed for such animals. This, in itself
offers a great danger to the health of mind and body. Health
of mind and body are equally endangered by the fact that
these animals are fed in great part with hybrid corn which
is minus the most essential element for maintaining health and
vitality — the vital life principle.
The Seed Germs — lack of which, according to our experi-
ence and the opinions of nationally known Biochemists, un-
balances the vitamin and mineral elements which should be con-
tained in the meat if it is to be a desirable food to maintain
health and strength.

efficient legislation, though it has been openly said by competent
authorities, that opposition by producers and processors of food
is so strong due to self interest, that really efficient laws cannot
be enacted at this time.

advertising slogan you'd hear in a nightmare. But let the
words sink in ... digest the facts. When you eat that de-
licious, juicy lamb chop, porterhouse steak, or smoked ham,
you may be opening the door of a death trap.
"This startling and incredible fact has been revealed
by one of the top cancer experts in the country-Dr. W.
C. Hueper, chief of the environmental cancer section of
the National Cancer InstiNte of the United States Health
Service....
"There is nothing wrong with eating meat. The
danger lies only in how the animals are fed2
and how the
meat is prepared, processed and packaged.2
"And that's where the Food and Drug Administra-
tion has let the American people down in that it has failed
-partly due to ineffective laws;l-to prevent food manu-
facturers and meat producers from putting dangerous
chemical agents into our food.
"The report by Dr. Hueper, which ... shows that
2 The writer no doubt has in mind only the Toxic substances
that are mixed with the feed for such animals. This, in itself
offers a great danger to the health of mind and body. Health
of mind and body are equally endan~ered by the fact that
these animals are fed in great part with hybrid corn which
is minus the most essential element for maintaining health and
vitality - the vital life principle.
The Seed Germs - lack of which, according to our experi-
ence and the opinions of nationally known Biochemists, un-
balances the vitamin and mineral elements which should be con-
tained in the meat if it is to be a desirable food to maintain
health and strength.
S Great effort is being made at the present writing to enact
efficient legislation, though it has been openly said by competent
authorities, that opposition by producers and processors of food
is so strong due to self interest, that really efficient laws cannot
be enacted at this time.

many meats, such as chicken, fish, pork, beef and lamb
may become contaminated with cancer-producing agents.
"Danger in Smoked Meats
"He pointed out that, in the case of smoked hams,
bacon and fish, there is potential danger in the smoking
process.4 Danger also lurks in the plastic casings for
sausage.5
"But probably the most sensational revelation deals
with the careless (deliberate)—and almost criminal—
use of femalesex hormones6 to fatten chickens and meat
animals. Dr. Hueper said the use of these hormones poses
a growing threat to the entire nation.
4 Comparatively small portions of "smoked" meats such as
ham and bacon is actually cured in the old-fashioned manner.
Instead, these meats are injected with certain substances which
help affect a "cure" in a few weeks, replacing the former natural
method of "cure" which required many months in brine and then
weeks in properly smoking. The present "cured" or "smoked"
hams and bacon, when sliced, will not keep eatable for weeks in
ordinary refrigerators, while when properly cured and smoked
in the old-fashioned manner a ham was cut, hung in the attic,
slices cut off, as required, the rest keeping in perfect condition
for months until finally consumed.
It is our opinion that hams and bacon treated in the old-
fashioned manner are not risks to health. We base our conclu-
sions on the fact that for hundreds of years, while these hams and
bacon were very liberally consumed, little was known of cancer,
and untold families made these products their basic foods. On
the contrary, due to the present manner of "curing" hams and
bacon, they quickly become putrid, and unfit for human con-
sumption.
9 As a protection, the wise housewife will not buy any
processed animal food in plastic casings.
6 It is important that we point out again and again that
the agents employed are not true sex hormones, but are synthetic
chemical Toxic agents known as Stilbestrol. If true Estrogen.

confronted with only one grave evil: Stilbestrol. Now there are
numerous preservatives to be considered. Among the latest is
something called "acronizing." The New York Herald Tribune,

'acronized' label are small cut-up broiler fryers, all ready

"The director of the Arizona Department of Health
reported:
" 'Actually we have no program of lack of funds or
facilities and certainly we have no research.12
Our pure
food laws need revamping and must be brought up to
date.1S
However, without additional facilities such laws
are of no use:
"The director of health of West Virginia bluntly
admitted:
" 'While the state law prohibits the introduction of
chemicals into foods, the amount of food control work
done in the state is very limited and the addition of adul-
terants, preservatives, etc., in many cases go undetected:H
"A health official in Mississippi made the shocking
admission:
"'Mississippi has no modern food, drug and
cosmetics act. Our old statute . . . was fashioned after the
federal act of 1906. No money was appropriated for the
enforcement of this act in Mississippi for many, many
,
years.
12 There are no funds for the purpose of protecting the
men, women and children of America from the dangers of be-
coming victims of the most vicious of diseases, but there are

may be a repetition, but is made necessary by the fact of criticism
by some physicians who feel we accuse them of misuse, which is
not true in any instance. It is further to be remembered that in
most instances when we quote writers, we modify statements
made by them to avoid accusing any one personally; our purpose
being to convey information which we feel based on truth.
"The problem of chemicals in food is the problem of
[preventing] potential chronic, Toxic and carcinogenic
effects on human beings from the hundreds of chemicals
consumed in common foodstuffs [and having their effects
throughout life.] True, the prevention of cancer in humans
requires a comprehensive attack on all possible carcinogens
in modern man's environment—from poluted atmosphere
and water, occupational exposures, heavy cigarette smok-
ing and [over exposure or too frequent exposure] X-Rays
—as well as an attack on whatever carcinogens be present
in our daily foods.
All of these causes for developing cancer are occurrences.
One MOST important item, probably more so than all others as
indicated by immediate present experiments, is the denaturing
of food, laying the system wide open to the effects of these
enemies. It is now becoming an accepted fact by physicians mak-
ing experiments, that generally cancer can make its onslaught

by some physicians who feel we accuse them of misuse, which is
not t,ue in any instance. It is !u,thef" to be ,emembef"ed that in
most instances when we quote writers, we modify statements
made by them to avoid accusing anyone personally; our purpose
being to convey information which we feel based on t,mh.
"The problem of chemicals in food is the problem of
{preventing] potential chronic, Toxic and carcinogenic
effeCts on human beings from the hundreds of chemicals
consumed in common foodstuffs {and having their effeets
throughout life.] True, the prevention of cancer in humans
requires a comprehensive attaek on all possible carcinogens
in modern man's environment-from poluted atmosphere
and water, occupational exposures, heavy cigarette smok·
ing and {over exposure or too frequent exposure) X-Rays
-as well as an attack on whatever carcinogens be present
in our daily foods.
All of these causes for developing cancer are occurrences.
One MOST important item, probably more so than all others as
indicated by immediate present experiments, is the denaturing
of food, laying the system wide open to the effects of these
enemies. It is now becoming an accepted fact by physicians mak-
ing experiments, that generally cancer can make its onslaught
only if there are cells in the body which are not properly and
fully fed-that is, if the system does not receive the vital ele-
ments in the food ingested, these more especially including
organic Vitamin E, Vitamin 8-12, Vitamin C Complex, to-
gether with sufficient bile extracts-if the liver is not suffi-

84 YOUR HEALTH AND SANITY
This statement should have the most careful consideration
of all consumers. It is little less than an excuse for the continued
use of many additives admittedly detrimental to health in the
statement indicated by the phrase: "IF PROPERLY USED."
Who is to stand guard over the many processors to see to
it that no more than the permitted amount of such additives are
added. Who is to watch over the consumers to see to it that they
do not consume more than a proper proportion of such adulter-
ated foods? When the physician prescribes an agent he is fully
aware may be detrimental if too much is taken, or for too long
a time, he is dealing with an individual AND NOT A MASS, and
he is in constant touch with the patient (consumer), and able
to stop the drug or chemical at a moment's notice. There is NO
SUCH THING AS PERFECT SAFETY IF PROPERLY USED of any
drug or chemical in the hands of the mass.
(b) This matter of tolerance and safe doses of any additive
which is in itself dangerous to health in too large a proportion
is a myth, and a dangerous one as far as the public is concerned.
Who is to watch over the millions of consumers and tell them
when they have consumed foods filled with additives to the
point of tolerance and safety? If every one consumed the SAME
AMOUNT of the SAME FOODS, then this might be possible. This
doctrine/or concept of safety and tolerance is misleading and

84 YOUR HEALTH AND SANITY
This statement should have the most careful consideration
of all consumers. It is little less than an excuse for the continued
use of many additives admittedly detrimental to health in the
statement indicated by the phrase: "IF PROPERLY USED."
Who is to stand guard over the many processors to see to
it that no more than the permitted amount of such additives are
added. Who is to watch over the consumers to see to it that they
do not consume more than a proper proportion of such adulter-
ated foods? When the physician prescribes an agent he is fully
aware may be detrimental if too much is taken, or for too long
a time, he is dealing with an individual AND NOT A MASS, and
he is in constant touch with the patient (consumer), and able
to stop the drug or chemical at a moment's notice. There is NO
SUCH THING AS PERFECT SAFETY IF PROPERLY USED of any
drug or chemical in the hands of the mass.
(b) This matter of tolerance and safe doses of any additive
which is in itself dangerous to health in too large a proportion
is a myth, and a dangerous one as far as the public is concerned.
Who is to watch over the millions of consumers and tell them
when they have consumed foods filled with additives to the
point of tolerance and safety? If everyone consumed the SAME
AMOUNT of the SAME FOODS, then this might be possible. This
doctrine/or concept of safety and tolerance is misleeding and
dangerous to the people's health and sanity.
(c) The "grandfather clause" is evident in the statement
contained in the "release":
"For substances already in use prior to January 1, 1958,
but which may not be generally recognized by experts as
safe, industry will have eighteen months [note this] from

consumers will continue to ingest the many additives con-
demned as cancer and other incurable disease producers. How
many victims will there be as a result of this eighteen months
indulgence? Secondly, because in all past statements by the
various authorities, it was made clear that it would take
from two to seven years to definitely discover whether or
not an additive was, or was not, disease creating; and, THAT
THERE WAS NO MONEY AVAILABLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SO
VAST A SCALE OF TESTS AND INVESTIGATION. WHAT IS THE
ANSWER? Is it that the consumers must console themselves as
best they can and continue to ingest poisonous substances detri-
mental to their health and sanity until such time, God only
knows when, such tests have been made.
Acceptance that there is such a thing as tolerance or a
safe dose of any Toxic substance without ultimate physical,
mental harm, is based on a dangerous delusion. There is no such
possibility of tolerance or safe dosage in a Toxic substance con-
stantly ingested, and in many instances accumulating.

CAUSE THE PHYSICIAN DEALS WITH abnormal CONDITIONS TO
BEGIN WITH, AND HE CONTINUES THEIR USE only UNTIL THE
ABNORMAL CONDITION has been removed or eliminated.
WHEREIN DOES SAFETY LIE? In as far as humanly pos-

Natural Preservatives
Broadly speaking, there are possibly only two natural
preservatives (additives): Unrefined sugar and pure apple cider
vinegar. Both are from natural sources, hence can be metabo-
lized by the system.
Natural sugar — this includes honey — is the ideal pre-
servative for fruit as well as to add taste to many foods. Natural
vinegar is a preservative of vegetables and meats. It also serves
a good purpose moderately used, on vegetable salads with oils
as part of meals when protein foods are served, especially meats
and seafood, helping to prevent intestinal purification.

salable for weeks or months except for the newer chemical
additives.18
"The chemical industry has been most active and
ingenious at devising and supplying every sort of additive
substances to "improve" and maintain the saleability and
good appearance [at the expense of nutriment and benefit
to the consumer] of commercial and packaged food prod-
ucts.19 Especially to be questioned are those additives that
keep the product from becoming stale in flavor, or losing
its good appearance with time or lack of refrigeration, to
permit it to have a longer life on the shelf or in the freezer
or refrigerator, before off-tastes and odors develop.20
"Many consider the wide use of such foods to be an
element of modern scientific and industrial progress, but
18 The experienced Dietitian cannot conceive how a rational
mind can entertain the idea that any preserved food which, due
to the additives employed in its preparation and kept beyond a
certain short period, can possibly be a nourishing food. The
natural procedure is to prepare food, boiled, roasted, or fried,
and serve while still warm. Few foods have any real value if
retained for even a short period and then are rebaked or reheat-
ed. One of our associates has named these many pre-prepared and
partly baked preparations "the embalmed foods." The term is
applicable and descriptive.
19 In our opinion, there is but one way of safety. If health
is to be maintained: Do not consume these pre-prepared "foods."
A fresh vegetable salad with cottage cheese dressing and a glass
of milk, is both safe and nourishing for lunch or all secondary
meals. Its actual food value, unquestioned as to purity, is far
beyond an "embalmed" prepared food; while a baked apple and
almonds, to which may be added milk, will furnish the body
with all the minerals and vitamins it requires for proper func-
tioning.
20 If an offtaste and odor develops, as we have found among
foods experimented with, this should be proof in itself of the
undesirability of ingesting such foods, and prevent the housewife
from serving them to her family.

salable for weeks or months except for the newer chemical
additives.18
"The chemical industry has been most active and
ingenious at devising and supplying every sort of additive
substances to "improve" and maintain the saleability and
good appearance [at the expense of nutriment and benefit
to the consumer] of commercial and packaged food prod-
ucts.If} Especially to be questioned are those additives that
keep the product from becoming stale in flavor, or losing
its good appearance with time or lack of refrigeration, to
permit it to have a longer life on the shelf or in the freezer
or refrigerator, before off-tastes and odors develop.20
"Many consider the wide use of such foods to be an
element of modern scientific and industrial progress, but
18 The experienced Dietitian cannot conceive how a rational
mind can entertain the idea that any preserved food which, due
to the additives employed in its preparation and kept beyond a
certain short period, can possibly be a nourishing food. The
natural procedure is to prepare food, boiled, roasted, or fried.
and serve while still warm. Few foods have any real value if
retained for even a short period and then are rebaked or reheat-
ed. One of our associates has named these many pre-prepared and
pardy baked preparations "the embalmed foods." The term is
applicable and descriptive.
19 In our opinion, there is but one way of safety. If health
is to be maintained: Do not consume these pre-prepared "foods."
A fresh vegetable salad with cottage cheese dressing and a glass
of milk, is both safe and nourishing for lunch or all secondary
meals. Its actual food value, unquestioned as to purity, is far
beyond an "embalmed" prepared food; while a baked apple and
almonds, to which may be added milk, will furnish the body
with all the minerals and vitamins it requires for proper func-
tioning.
20 If an oHtaste and odor develops, as we have found among
foods experimented with, this should be proof in itself of the
undesirability of ingesting such foods, and prevent the housewife
from serving them to her family.

some time of his life and the expectation of a case of

"It is known that diet is an important factor in pre-
venting the development of bodily conditions that tend to
favor the beginnings of a cancerous condition, and with
care and a willingness to go to a little extra trouble, we
can modify our eating habits in ways that will tend to

The Agents of Death, the Decisions of Food and
Drug Administration, and the Testimony of
Experienced, Reputable Medical Men
The Food and Drug Administration cracked down on food
and drug stores promoting dietary products "to build up
the resistance against Asiatic Flu." — The Philadelphia
Inquirer, December 21,1957.
If vital foods—a correct and nutritional regime, cannot
build up resistance to disease—help the sick recover from ill-
ness—then there is no greater charlatanry than the dieticians
employed in hospitals throughout the nation.
If it is admitted that a correct dietary composed of vital
foods is inefficient to build up resistance to disease, then man
may eat whatever he desires, even though there is not a single
unit of either vitamins or minerals in the food he ingests, and
retain his health and strength, despite ignoring all dietary laws.
Why then recommend liver and iron for anemia? Why all
the other compounds running into billions of dollars each year,
prescribed by the experienced physicians? Why not just eat,
drink and be merry, and live a full life? Will experienced phy-
sicians agree to this?
How does this ruling compare with other acts and rulings,
or lack of rulings and information, by the Food and Drug
Administration? Let us consider an article by George McGrath,
published in the National Police Gazette, January 1958 edition,
in which is included a report made by W. C. Hueper, M. D., an
expert in the U. S. Government, together with Mr. McGrath's

At first thought, it would appear that such a question is
not only ridiculous, but idiotic? Is IT? For years it has been
known, and is now becoming general knowledge, that the
greater part of our foods are adulterated with more or less
poisonous substances, some of them cancer creating. For some

to have protective laws enacted. To what extent have these
efforts been successful? As a result of present agitation, will
present laws be enforced? Refer to CHAPTER ONE, Section Five.
It is said that "comparisons are odious." No doubt this is
generally true. However, in giving consideration to a subject
of far greater importance than any other conceivable by the
mind of man—THE WELFARE OF THE CHILD, it can be wisely
used to drive home facts generally ignored.
As already stated, although the demand for protective
legislation against Toxic substances in the food for man is
becoming nation-wide, practically no attention has been given
it by our Legislators. Now consider the comparison:

VITAMINS:
There are probably few families in the United States who,
due to much advertising in every form and medium, now firmly
believe their children should be given vitamins regularly to
make up for deficiencies in the diet; even the elders take them.
The worst feature of this is the fact that it is generally true. Now
it is officially revealed that at least some makers of vitamins—
but which, is the question—adulterate them with Toxic sub-
stances. CAN HUMAN CREATURES FALL LOWER THAN THIS?
LUNCH:
In many families lunch is a secondary meal, but even so,
it may consist of bread, butter and perhaps jellies, already ana-
lyzed. Perhaps the fine food cottage cheese, now frequently
adulterated with 8-Hyroxyquinoline, a chief remedy in Hemor-
rhoid suppositories, and perhaps vegetables that have been
treated with Nigrosine, or Benzo-purpidine to make them look
fresh and appetizing. Perhaps pecans dyed in a coal tar are added
to the meal. This simple meal can be a safe one if baked pota-
toes are substituted for the bread; vegetables, carefully selec-
ted, for the salad, and a soup of known purity added; or, in
place of soup, milk from a source known for its purity and
unadulteration.
THE EVENING MEAL:
No matter how wise and careful, here the housewife is
almost certain to meet with difficulties. Unless she is fully in-
formed of the source of her meats, she may select chicken which
is almost certain to have been inoculated with Stilbestrol, pos-
sibly diseased, and dipped in a Toxic substance such as Chlorte-
tracycline; or meats from animals fed with Stilbestrol and/or

"The germ is oily. When stored for any length of time,
this oil may become rancid, so it is removed at the begin-

this portion of that vitamin is lacking in the flour. As
Scheunert says ... 'as we can prove in the case of rats starved

ADMISSION OF DANGERS
"Broadly speaking, these chemicals in your food present
two types of peril.19 Many of them are Toxic, and if allowed
in a food in sufficient quantities [or for a sufficient time} *°
could slowly poison you.21
'The problem is a long-standing one. Back in 1906
when the Food and Drug Act was first passed, there was
concern about the use of formaldehyde as a preservative."
''The other danger hasn't been recognized so long. It is
the POSSIBILITY 21 that some of the chemicals used in food
might have [does have]21 carcinogenic properties that over
the years cause cancer. Poisons [in many instances] have
their antidotes and cures, but carcinogenic damage to cells
is irreversible.
"These dangers exist mainly because of a defect in the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law. Under the present
law, the food industry is not required to prove chemical
are believed to do; causing the formation of gas during diges-
tion, the gas liable to bring about inflammation, and possibly
ulcers which ultimately turn into cancer. No metallic substance
can be metabolized, hence all of them are liable to be causative
of disease.
19 An admission that suck dangers do exist; hence no one,
no human being, has the right to prepare and sell food prepara-
tions unless he is certain that no danger lurks in them. No true
American physician would ever risk prescribing a medicine the
action and reaction of which he did not possess a full knowledge
and he should be an example to processors of food, as he is in
medicine.
20 Nutritionists believe that all pre-cooked "foods", shipped
and sold in food stores, may be carriers of self-developing Toxins,
and that no food partly cooked or baked, held for a time, and
then recooked or baked, can be considered a safe or nourishing
food.

THE AGE OF TREASON
ADMISSION OF DANGERS
117
"Broadly speaking, these chemicals in your food present
two types of peril.19
Many of them are Toxic, and if allowed
in a food in sufficient quantities [or for a sufficient time} 20
could slowly poison you.u
"The problem is a long-standing one. Back in 1906
when the Food and Drug Act was first passed, there was
concern about the use of formaldehyde as a preservative. 21
"The other danger hasn't been recognized so long. It is
the POSSIBILITY 21 that some of the chemicals used in food
might have [does have)21 carcinogenic properties that ovet"
the years cause cancer. Poisons [in many instances} have
their antidotes and cures, but carcinogenic damage to cells
is irreversible.
"These dangers exist mainly because of a defect in the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law. Under the present
law, the food industry is not required to prove chemical
are believed to do; causing the formation of gas during diges-
tion, the gas liable to bring about inflammation, and possibly
ulcers which ultimately turn into cancer. No metallic substance
can be metabolized, hence all of them are liable to be causative
of disease.
III An admission that sudt dangers do exist; hence no one,
no human being, has the right to prepare and sell food prepara-
tions unless he is certain that no danger lurks in them. No true
American physician would ever risk prescribing a medicine the
action and reaction of which he did not possess a full knowledge
and he should be an example to processors of food, as he is in
medicine.
20 Nutritionists believe that all pre-eooked "foods", shipped
and sold in food stores, may be carrien of self-developing Toxins,
and that no food partly cooked or baked, held for a time, and
then recooked or baked, can be considered a safe or nourishing
food.

additives to be safe.22 The FDA must do this after the pro-
duct is already on the market. Since it takes a minimum of
two years to prove the lack of Toxicity 23 and seven years
to prove that a product is not cancer-inducing, the public
could be (is) in a serious jeopardy.—Emphasis ours.
"Hormones are used to fatten and tenderize poultry and
livestock. Although the FDA says that Stilbestrol, the hor-
mone most often used, is safe 24 because no trace can be
found by delicate tests in the meat of the animals,26 critics,
such as Congressman James J. Delaney and others both in
Congress and out, point to evidence that improper injection
21 Mothers with infants to feed should constantly bear in
mind the fact that many farmers feed their cows with feeds
mixed with Penicillin, so strongly condemned by many authori-
ties; that this milk is then frequently adulterated by the use of
formaldehyde and/or various additives. To avoid this danger,
when at all possible, mothers who love their babies should make
every effort to procure their supply direct from producers who
do not use additives or adulterants.
22 Refer to the revelations made by W. C. Hueper, M. D., a
most grave admission on the part of an apparent apologist for
adulterations.
23 If Toxicity must be proven, how was it possible for the
Food and Drug Administration to proceed to "crack down" on
dietary products, such as vitamins, minerals, and natural foods
which build up vitality and resistance to the invasion of disease,
these products being non-Toxic? Are products for the welfare
of the people to be banned, while hundreds of so-called foods
adulterated with Toxic Chemicals may be sold freely to people?
What is the answer?
24 Government investigators, according to published reports,
have found to the contrary. So have physicians of highest author-
ity on the subject.
25 In reports released it is clearly shown that this Toxic drug
has been found in the heads, entrails and livers of animals fed
with it. Refer and study the conclusions and actions taken by
Wyoming Veterinarians.

"The amount of sorbitan chemicals in any one food may
not be dangerous, but when it is added up in the MANY

LIEVE THAT CONSUMERS ARE RECEIVING MORE THAN IS
GOOD FOR THEM."—Quoted verbatim. Emphasis ours.
It is to be noted that in not a single instance in the employ-
ment of the more than 700 or more additives is there even a
hint that any single one of them has the slightest possibility of
either serving as food or medicine to the consumer. Would any
reputable experienced physician prescribe for his patients any
chemical substance to be taken regularly and in ever increasing
amount with the intent of keeping them well?
Foods, yes, because the body needs them, but chemicals
which have no part in metabolism, emphatically no. What right
then have the manufacturers of food to add these additives to
foods for daily human consumptions, and especially to the foods
for babies and children. Why is it done? This is what the people
who have awakened to the danger, want to know. Is it solely
for profit, or are many of the processors of foods working hand

and their action is such. Vitamins as in Nature were, and are,
balanced by Nature, and work in harmony. Remove a single one
of them and there is an unbalance. Thinking of this process of
unbalancing recalls to mind the childhood nursery rhyme:
"Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall,

With the discontinuation of the use of nitrogen Tri-
chloride, did flour adulteration with Toxic substances end? //
did not. Chloride Dioxide was substituted for it. Today numer-
ous other additives5 are used in one way or another in the
production of flour and the making of bread, cakes, biscuits,
buns and the many other baked foods.
Many plead: Is there no method whereby one may obtain
all the elements of the wheat to supply the system with them?
There is. A method long followed6 by Russian peasants much
as we do with barley and oats. We have reports that this is now
being done by children in some American schools, and that the
children delight in eating these sprouts when about one inch
long. NO FOOD CAN BE MORE NOURISHING. OR FURNISH
VITAMINS AND MINERALS IN MORE PERFECT FORM.
In a widely circulated reprint of an article written by Dr.
M. A. Branden of Loraine, Ohio, and published in the NA-
TIONAL POLICE GAZETTE, May 1957, issue, under the title:
6 A gene previously used, also found a substitute in bro-
mides. Bromides have their application in so-called nerve sooth-
ing remedies in mental and nervous disorders, but have no place
in food for generally well people. The physician, not the miller
or baker, is the proper person to prescribe them.
6 The Procedure: Procure one of the many outfits now ob-
tainable for this purpose. The grain is kept moist until its
sprouts are about an inch long. The procedure is similar, per-
haps simpler, than the sprouting of beans by the Chinese. These
germinated seeds are in the fullest state of development, con-
taining and releasing enzyme and protein mobilization. These
sprouts may be eaten as is, be made into a salad, or slightly
heated.

long. NO FOOD CAN BE MORE NOURISHING. OR FURNISH
VITAMINS AND MINERALS IN MORE PERFECT FORM.
In a widely circulated reprint of an article written by Dr.
M. A. Branden of Loraine, Ohio, and published in the NA-
TIONAL POLICE GAZETTE, May 1957, issue, under the title:
~ Agene previously used, also found a substitute in bro-
mides. Bromides have their application in so-called nerve sooth-
ing remedies in mental and nervous disorders, but have no place
in food for generally well people. The physician, not the miller
or baker, is the proper person to prescribe them.
IS The Procedure: Procure one of the many outfits now ob-
tainable for this purpose. The grain is kept moist until its
sprouts are about an inch long. The procedure is similar, per-
haps simpler, than the sprouting of beans by the Chinese. These
germinated seeds are in the fullest state of development, con-
taining and releasing enzyme and protein mobilization. These
sprouts may be eaten as is, be made into a salad, or slightly
heated.

"Otherwise the trial sometimes comes too late, as
shown in articles published this week from THE COM-
MERCIAL APPEAL WASHINGTON BUREAU. About 150
chemicals are being added to food without waiting for
laboratory tests and medical testimony to establish that
they can be taken into the body safely.
"Most of the big companies processing food get the
proof before they add the chemicals,12 and there are many
more unproven chemicals than there were a few years ago.
But taking a new preparation to the Federal Food and Drug
Administration and waiting for the testing is only a volun-
tary precaution.18
"For the uncautious and for the unscrupulous, who
continue to use a product after the FDA has found it
poisonous, a law to protect the public is necessary. A
House investigating committee has recommended such a
law. Representative James ]. Delaney (D., N.Y.) wrote
one. The Food and Drug Administration staff wrote a
milder law.14

Laws as so frequently repeated, does not require the processors

chemicals are being added to food without waiting for
laboratory tests and medical testimony to establish that
they can be taken into the body safely.
"Most of the big companies processing food get the
proof before they add the chemicals,l:! and there are many
more unproven chemicals than there were a few years ago.

continue to use a product after the FDA has found it

one. The Food and Drug Administration staff wrote a

Candy, an Uncontrolled Concoction
Much of a Toxic Nature
If the question were asked: WHAT DO CHILDREN

Bread, cakes, pies and other foods made with Denatured
flour, or candies and other sweets, containing very few
natural substances that can be classed as "food," few would
be able to answer factually.
One thing is certain, when you want to please your sweet-
heart, wife or children, and you hand them a box of that luscious
looking candy, you will delight them. Unfortunately, you are
almost certain to hand them a Toxic concoction that, though a
delight to the eyes and most pleasant to taste, is all too fre-
quently poisonous to body and mind.
Instead of offering our own conclusions, the result of
experiences, our recourse is to an article which appeared in The
Police Gazette, December 1957, prepared by Bob Hartfood, and
a statement of non-food elements, drugs described by Merck,
used in making various candies. Quotation marks are used when
we quote verbatim:
"When you give someone candy with the thought to
please them, you may be giving someone a free ride to the

Health Minister Paul Martin told the Canadian Parlia-
ment the dye had been found poisonous and might even
be a contributing factor in cancer.
"That the coal-tar dye is dangerous is well known to
health officials of both nations. In 1955 the U. S. Food
and Drug Administration banned its use for coloring
oranges, stating it was not harmless. The FDA declined
to list it among the dyes 'suitable for use in food.'
"In fact, the orange dye was reported to have caused
sickness in hundreds of children who ate popcorn and
candy that had been tinted with it. And small doses proved
deadly to dogs on which it was tested.
"But the orange growers of Florida and Texas de-
clared that use of this dye to color their oranges was in-
dispensable to their business.2 And on this basis they
managed to push through Federal legislation that has
suspended the FDA ban on coloring.

be a contributing factor in cancer.
"That the coal-tar dye is dangerous is well known to
health officials of both nations. In 1955 the U. S. Food
and Drug Administration banned its use for coloring
oranges, stating it was not harmless. The FDA declined
to list it among the dyes 'suitable for use in food:
"In fact, the orange dye was reported to have caused
sickness in hundreds of children who ate popcorn and
candy that had been tinted with it. And small doses proved
deadly to dogs on which it was tested.
"But the orange growers of Florida and Texas de-
clared that use of this dye to color their oranges was in-
dispensable to their business.2
And on this basis they
managed to push through Federal legislation that has
suspended the FDA ban on coloring.

Food Additives, Past and Present
More and more the alarm is being spread against the
dangers to health and mind by the constantly increasing number
of additives being used in the processing of foods for human
consumption. It is doubtful if a single one of these additives
has in mind either the improvement of such processed foods, or
to make them a greater benefit. The purpose, apparently, is
solely, basically, a matter of profit—the prevention of quick
spoilage normal to natural foods—or their less expense in ship-
ping, and retaining their appearance for sale.
One of the latest of newspapers to warn its readers against
these additives, was the Memphis Commercial Appeal, April
14, 1958, under the descriptive head:
"Some Progress Made
"WASHINGTON, April 14,—When a housewife
visits a market these days, she has no sure way of knowing
whether some of the foods she selects contain chemical
additives.1
1 As so frequently pointed out throughout the text, the
careful housewife is more or less enabled to protect herself
by a careful scrutiny of the label. Even when only preservatives
are used, these are supposed to be named. If one of the various
dyes are used, the dye is mentioned, though possibly not named.
If additives, these are generally named. It will be sufficient
reason to discard any food product in which preservatives, dyes,
or additives are used, no matter what their name. On investi-
gating, we find that when even one housewife who is a good
customer, begins to question the dealer, he becomes apprehen-
sive, and starts a search for processed foods without additives,
and such that have not been denatured.

This disease affects the muscles of the body by hardening
them and gradually causing them to be unresponsive. This be-
ing true, it is certain that the cause must be found in something
that is capable of atrophying the muscles and bringing this
about gradually.
Is there a Toxic substance which, though formerly un-

There is.
This substance is Sodium Fluoride.6 Sodium Fluoride does
many things to the human body, more especially the muscles,
nerves and brain. Among other things, it has the power to
gradually atrophy the muscles; a cause in practically all muscu-
lar diseases. It shatters the nervous system. It softens the brain.
At the moment we are concerned only with one of Sodium
Fluoride's most destructive potentials; that of atrophying the
muscles. If any one has doubt that it does this, let him kill a rat
with this highly toxic substance and then examine the rat.

living creature may be immediate as when a "killing" dose is
given or taken, or through a slow process by accumulation, for
Sodium Fluoride, like Mercury, Arsenic and some other Toxic
agent's is accumulative and its effects are generally gradual. If

much the same.

seventh years, developed symptoms of chronic fluorisis.
They [the doctors] did not seem to know exactly what was
wrong with them. One day they had bowel complaints,
spasms and pain, diarrhea, cramps, etc.
"Another time it would be bladder trouble and
chronic constipation.... Doctors usually made a diagnosis
of Colitis or Ciliac. Professors Ham and Smith of the De-

scientific papers on the subject: FLUORINE BALANCE

the fluorine content of Pablum used to be between 7.5 to
9.8 parts per million. The present Pablum has a fluorine
content of between 1.5 to 2.2 parts per million.'

misleading one. Let us cite an example:
"In 1955, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration
found that cancer was induced by a pesticide known as
'Aramite' and attempted to prevent contamination of food
with this substance by establishing a zero tolerance for
it under the Miller Pesticide Act.
According to the experienced Dietitians and Biochemists,
there is no such thing as a "zero tolerance," i.e., "calculated
risk." It is true that the system may, by gradual use, intake
poisons without apparent effect, but this is the result of forcing
the system to readjust itself, and this apparent readjustment is
actually a "throwing off balance," a form of disease or abnor-
mality, the system changing from the natural as Nature organi-
zed it, to an unnatural or superficial state. It is true that in cer-
tain ailments physicians prescribe poisons without harmful
results, but it must be borne in mind that then the system is
already in an abnormal state, and the "curative" or balancing
amount of the drug is given only for the moment and then dis-
continued.
"After proceedings initiated by the United States
Rubber Company, FDA's decision was overthrown, and
it is now legal to sell foods known to contain Aramite.
"The precedent created by the Aramite decision
affords a convenient loophole to permit manufacturers to
go ahead and sell such compounds for use on or in foods.
This is what the FDA calls a calculated risk. The
calculation {unfortunately} is that the manufacturer can
get his profit, AND THE CONSUMER TAKES THE RISK."

Sodium Fluoride, as Pointed Out in the First Part
of This Chapter, Has the Potential Power
to Harden or Paralyze the Muscles, Hence
Dr. Hueper's Expert Opinion Is Apropos
Since the publication of the first edition of AGE OF
TREASON, the magazine, The National Police Gazette, March
1958 issue, offers the reader further information on this vital
subject of water adulteration, part of which is here reproduced,
indicating that the public is awakening to this dangerous prac-
tice and to warn against the use of such adulterated water for
drinking and the preparation of foods for human consumption.
"How many glasses of water do you drink daily?
Regardless of the amount, it doesn't take any scientific
formulas to reach the conclusion that all of us need water.
It is considered as our most important foodstuff, and as
such it deserves the greatest protection that [the] govern-
ment can give.
"Now comes a shocking and spine-tingling revelation
by a leading Government cancer expert. This exclusive
information is revealed by the Police Gazette in order to
spur Governmental action while there is still time to curb
this tremendous peril to the health of the whole nation.
"The threat is exposed in a report never before pub-
lished. Dr. W. C. Hueper, chief of the experimental cancer
section of the U. S. Health Service, National Health Insti-
tute, compiled the report. This is what Dr. Hueper says:
"The growing pollution of the human environment
with chemical and physical cancer-producing agents poses

CHAPTER THREE
Section One
Sodium Fluoride, as Pointed Out in the First Part
of This Chapter, Has the Potential Power
to Harden or Paralyze the Muscles, Hence
Dr. Hueper's Expert Opinion Is Apropos
Since the publication of the first edition of AGE OF
TREASON, the magazine, The National Police Gazette, March
1958 issue, offers the reader further information on this vital
subject of water adulteration, part of which is here reproduced,
indicating that the public is awakening to this dangerous prac-
tice and to warn against the use of such adulterated water for
drinking and the preparation of foods for human consumption.
"How many glasses of water do you drink daily?
Regardless of the amount, it doesn't take any scientific
formulas to reach the conclusion that all of us need water.
It is considered as our most important foodstuff, and as
such it deserves the greatest protection that [the] govern-
ment can give.
"Now comes a shocking and spine-tingling revelation
by a leading Government cancer expert. This exclusive
information is revealed by the Police Gazette in order to
spur Governmental action while there is still time to curb
this tremendous peril to the health of the whole nation.
"The threat is exposed in a report never before pub-
lished. Dr. W. C. Hueper, chief of the experimental cancer
section of the U. S. Health Service, National Health Insti-
tute, compiled the report. This is what Dr. Hueper says:
" 'The growing pollution of the human environment
with chemical and physical cancer-producing agents poses
a serious threat to our health.
" 'This pollution stems from modern industrial de--
velopment (without proper safeguards for the disposal of

dangerous chemicals—to the health of the people) and
creates a particular dangerous threat to our DRINKING
WATER. . . . The possibility of cancer hazards from water
deserves SERIOUS consideration.'
"The cancer expert . . . pointed out that cancer-
producing agents from factories and other industrial plants
may enter [almost every one is aware that it does so in
many instances] the drinking water supply. These DANGER-
OUS CHEMICALS may (are) also be absorbed in vegetables,
fruits and food animals.1
"The various materials which can produce cancer
threats through water were listed by Dr. Hueper as: arsen-
icals, aelenium, radio-active substances, waste from coke
ovens, tar refineries, gas plants, oil refineries, textile dye-
ing plants, paper manufacturers and cellulose factories.1
Menace is Increasing
"The doctor (Hueper) explained that the cancer
threat associated with exposure to cancer-producing agents
'represents a segment of the general toxic health hazards
connected with the production, distribution and consump-
tion of industrial products and the release of industrial
wastes into the environmental air, water and soil.
"The most important factor is that with industrial
activities rapidly expanding there is a good chance of the

mental—of the people, would not offer a serious problem if the
people living in the vicinity of such manufacturing plants were
alert, and immediately on becoming aware of such pollution
taking place, would take positive steps to halt it, and see to it
that these manufacturers would find proper means for the dis-
posal of such residue. This is the only means to prevent pollu-
tion. It is a simple method and can be followed by every Ameri-
can citizen who has the welfare of his own, and his fellow man's
well-being in mind.

"It is a demonstratable biochemical fact, which I
have repeatedly proved in my laboratory, that fluorine
(the metallic substance) even in minute amounts, over a
period of time, destroys THE ENZYMES WHICH MAKE
POSSIBLE THE UTILIZATION OF VITAMINS, MINERALS
AND OTHER NECESSARY FOOD COMPONENTS FOR THE
CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE HUMAN BODY.5 We
who are fighting water fluorination should confine our
efforts to bringing this information forcefully and clearly
to the public.
The identical results follow the feeding of the various
Toxic drugs to animals. These do two things: They destroy the
vital elements normally in the meat of the animal, and make
the meat unnutritious, and generally unfit for human consump-
tion.
In a personal letter to the present writer, Mr. Perkins
further states:
"In my letter you will notice that I make it clear that,
although the idea of artificial water fluoridation was first
conceived and practiced as a Communist technique for
CONTROL OF THE MASSES THROUGH SPECIFIC MEDICA-
TION TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN SPECIFIC SOCIOLOGICAL
RESULTS, THE MAIN ARGUMENT AGAINST ARTIFICIAL
WATER FLUORINATION IS NOT THE FACT THAT IT IS
PART AND PARCEL OF A COMMUNIST TECHNIQUE OF
MASS CONTROL, BUT THAT IT IS A DEVASTATING POISON
THAT, OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, COMPLETELY WRECKS
5 Perhaps this, in addition to the destructive power of
Sodium Fluoride, is why the deterioration of vitality and health
is so rapid when the substance is taken into the system, espe-
cially so in the case of children, and why even dental paste
manufacturers warn against its use before the age of six to nine.

Sodium Fluoride used in drinking water is a metallic10
substance. It is an iNorganic poison, with great Toxic qual-
ities, and cannot be changed by metabolism — human
digestion cannot change it. IT REMAINS A POISON. IT

Sodium Fluoride is not an essential to the body, bone or
teeth. IT is CALCIUM FLUORIDE AS FOUND IN NATURAL FOODS

ESSENTIAL TO THE BUILDING OF ALL BONY STRUCTURE AND

For a better understanding of Fluorides they should be
separated into three classifications:
1. Sodium Fluorides, a toxic chemical. This is employed in
fluoridizing water. It is a poison because it is a Toxic chem-
ical. This type of Fluoride causes precipitations of Calcium.
It cannot be metabolized. and the system cannot free itself
from it. It accumulates, after the manner of mercury and
arsenic.
2. Natural Fluorides. This is found in water in certain dis-
tricts. This fluoride, though not organic, is associated nat-
urally with other minerals and is not generally Toxic.
3. Organic Fluorides. This is found mostly in vegetables,
some fruits and other food substances. It is associated with,
and not inimical to natural calcium, and in conjunction
with vitamin C and Calcium, is a bone builder and teeth
preserver. It is not poisonous, and being metabolized as is
calcium and other minerals, it is not cumulative.

used as a rat poison. Cattlemen used it TO PARTIALLY STERIL-

certain Asiatic enslavers and murderers their idea to employ
it in destroying the resistance—WILL POWER—of those they
wanted to subjugate and/or enslave by first making them
robots.

were so grave that this method of treatment has been almost
entirely discontinued. Another example is the use formerly made
of Arsenic by women for whitening of the skin. It was found

Anemia or Tuberculosis.

be avoided. This requires only that in addition to undenatured
foods, a plentiful supply of natural vitamin C Complex and
Calcium bone meal be ingested. This would not alone help to
keep the teeth healthy and normal, but benefit the entire system.

recommended level of one part per million of fluoride in
drinking water, people in fluoridated communities have

for an entire population which includes the young, the old,

No one has made a claim that the ingestion of fluoride
can be of benefit to the teeth beyond the formative years of
childhood. Because of this, and for reasons of safety and
economy, this department has proposed that the City
distribute fluorine tablets through health stations, free of
charge, for parents to administer to children. The cost to
the City, ascertained at less than 25 cents for a thousand
days' supply for each child, would be less than one-fifth of
the cost of a fluoridated water program. Tablets (a phar-

"It is difficult to see how public health authorities can

of fluoridation is a perversion of hard-earned experience

The universal question asked by those who are truly Amer-
ican, law abiding, health conscious, and uncertain what proce-
dure to follow in protecting the bodies, minds and Spiritual
welfare of loved ones, is:
"What can we do if, against our will, the water sup-
ply is fluoridated?"
The answer is simple, but not always easy to carry out,
especially in those districts where the sources of water are
limited.
Do not use fluoridated water in the family either for drink-
ing or cooking purposes. If fresh springs are available, go there
for your water supply. If they are not, then buy bottled water.
It is cheaper than doctor bills for undermined physical and
mental ills, and may save you hours, perhaps months or years
of mental agony.
REPORT OF HEARINGS
New York City held public hearings on fluoridation at
which some 700 attended. These hearings were concluded
March 7th, 1957. One of the chief witnesses was Water Supply
Commissioner, Arthur C. Ford. He charged that "at best fluori-
dation delays82 tooth decay for two years, that there is proof of
fluoride damage to persons in fluoridated communities and that
concentrations of fluorides in the city's water pipes could not be
controlled."

as a class are salt-formers and fluorine has an affinity for

known as calcium fluoride.

"There are two main classes of fluorides: Those oc-

fluoride is not as Toxic as sodium fluoride, because it has
a higher weight and therefore does not dissolve as readily

"Tooth decay is an individual condition and not a
contagious disease. Therefore sodium fluoride should not
be put into the water supplies from which all and sundry
must drink. On the contrary, water should be kept as pure
as possible, since it is the universal cell solvent so vital to

"Tooth decay is an individual condition and not a
contagious disease. Therefore sodium fluoride should not
be put into the water supplies from which all and sundry
must drink. On the contrary, water should be kept as pure
as pOSJible, since it is the universal cell solvent so vital to
human physico-chemical relations.

reliable because they fail to take into consideration that:

Some Opinions of the Proponents
For Fluoridation
As is natural, we have throughout this book given the
findings and opinions of the opponents to fluoridation to show
what Sodium Fluoride actually is, and explain the danger to
physical and mental health its ingestion in fluids and foods
can bring about.
It is to be expected that the proponents will make every
effort to prove the contrary. They will claim it is not detrimental
to body and mind, and that it cannot be used for the purpose
the enemies of mankind claim it has been, is used, and can be
used effectively. Can they, do they prove, their point? We will
see.
The text we quote from is a widely circulated booklet with
the title: WATER FLUORIDATION; FACTS, NOT MYTHS, by Dr.
Louis I. Dublin, formerly connected with the Metropolitan Life
Insurance Company and accepted as an authority by the pro-
ponents for fluoridation.
"What is fluoridation? Adding fluoride (a natural
substance that is found in varying degree in all drinking
water and in many foods) to water to prevent tooth decay
is called 'fluoridation'.
This statement is not based on fact. In the fluoridation of
water, it is NOT natural fluoride that is used, but a metallic sub-
stance, —iNorganic—that is, MANUFACTURED, is AN OFF-

like myself condemn the fluoridation of water, and the adulter-
ation of food, and that no physician of experience and reputation
is against it.

"Dr. Kerwin warned that strontium 90 and the
fluoride added to water form a compound that, in effect,
reduces the rate at which Strontium 90 is thrown off
normally. Thus, 'the body will be exposed to that much
more internal radiation,' according to Dr. Kerwin.
Fluoride Can Be Cut
"'Fallout of strontium 90 from those nuclear explo-

fallout from others which unfortunately may yet take
place cannot be prevented,' Dr. Kerwin explained. 'But

The Menace of Fluorine to Health
Perhaps the most authoritative published report on Sodium
Fluoride is the University of New Mexico Bulletin, under the
title of The Menace of Fluoride to Health, prepared by John D.
Clark and Edward H. Mann of the University of New Mexico,
from which we quote:
"Cases are on record which show that ingestion of
small amounts of fluorides is fatal to both man and other
animals. Tappeiner1 describes the effects of fluorides on
dogs, cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs when given by oral
ingestion. When 0.5 of a gram of sodium fluoride per
hundred grams of body weight is given orally, or 0.15 of a
gram is given by subcutaneous or intervenous injection,
the symptoms are as follows: a condition of drowsiness and
weakness; cramps which may attack a single organ or the
entire body, and are epileptic in character; paralysis of the
vasomotor centers; acceleration and deepening of the
breathing with paralysis following; vomiting; secretion
from the salivary and tear glands; and, finally death.
"Certain investigators have observed that vegetation
growing in the vicinity of aluminum factories, from which
fluorine is given off in the waste gases, absorbs this fluor-
ine. The herbiverous animals of these vicinities exhibit an
endemic toxicosis which has been attributed to the con-
sumption of this vegetation, and the above stated char-
acteristics symptoms of fluorine poisoning have repro-
duced by feeding the suspected forage to guinea pigs.

of these elements, and bone development is retarded pro-

ing the mottling and decay of the teeth. No signs of the

Medical-Dental Ad Hoc Committee Findings
on Fluoridation
There is every indication that Medical and Dental opinion
against Fluoridation is rapidly increasing. A meeting of the
above committee was held in New York City, and the findings
reported in the NEW YORK WORLD TELEGRAM AND SUN,
February 24, 1958. Extracts of the conclusions follow, and
should be added to the opinions of medical men already quoted.
Dr. Jonathan Forman, head of the Medical-Dental Ad Hoc
Committee on Evaluation of Fluoridation stated that the com-
mittee represents more than 1500 physicians, dentists and
scientists all over the United States. Of these, he said, 200 are
in New York City.
"Dr. Forman said he would not identify any lest they
be subjected to "punitive action."1 He asserted many op-
ponents of fluoridation have been threatened with censure.1
Dr. Forman is reported to have further stated:
"There is not sufficient, reliable scientific data avail-
able to justify positive action concerning artificial mass
fluoridation of any public water supply."

by the almost certainty that there will be reprisals in one form
or another, the worst of which may be a charge of being mentally
ill, and the danger of being confined in an institution for the

"Nature has ordained that natural illnesses be cured
by substances which are capable of producing the same
symptoms in the healthy. This natural law is termed the
Law of Similars. It is also ordained that when an illness
is so cured, THE MEDICINE MUST BE STOPPED,* otherwise
THERE WILL BE PRODUCED AN ARTIFICIAL DISEASE
WHICH WILL BECOME CHRONIC AND EVENTUALLY IN-
CURABLE. This explains the existence here in our great
United States of 45,000,000 chronic sick, mostly incurable,
ARTIFICIALLY IMPOSED DRUG8 DISEASES. What chance
have people to remain well if forced to poison themselves
with fluorine every time they take a drink of water?
4 The physician will prescribe such drugs only when actually
indicated, and stop it immediately when it is no longer neces-
sary, thus preventing any accumulation. This is impossible when
there is mass medication. Much stress is laid on a supposed fact,
that a certain given amount is not detrimental to health. This
might be true, but sight is lost, or deliberately evaded, that
in addition to the amount in water, a further quantity is
taken in food, and those drinking beer which might con-
tain the poison, if heavy drinkers, would take many times
the supposed "safe" amount.
6 This statement is too limited. Besides the numerous ac-
counted diseases caused by additives, some compulsory as Sodium
Fluoride in drinking water, there are the many denatured foods
that are unbalanced, upsetting the functions, of the system,
and the addition of the hundreds of toxic additives in the various
foods consumed. These all combined serve no useful purpose to
the system but, being unnatural, hence unbalancing, are weak-
ness, disease creating.

United States of 45,000,000 chronic sick, mostly incurable,
ARTIFICIALLY IMPOSED DRUd' DISEASES. What chance
have people to remain well if forced to poison themselves
with fluorine every time they take a drink of water?
4 The physician will prescribe such drugs only when actually
indicated, and stop it immediately when it is no longer neces-
sary, thus preventing any accumulation. This is impossible when
there is mass medication. Much stress is laid on a supposed fact,
that a certain given amount is not detrimental to health. This
might be true, but sight is lost, or deliberately evaded, that
in addition to the amount in water, a further quantity is
taken in food, and those drinking bur whkh might con-
tain t~ poison, if heavy drinkers, would take many times
the supposed "safe" amount.
II This statement is too limited. Besides the numerous ac-
counted diseases caused by additives, some compulsory as Sodium
Fluoride in drinking water, there are the many denatured foods
that are unbalanced, upsetting the functions, of the system,
and the addition of the hundreds of toxic additives in the various
foods consumed. These all combined serve no useful purpose to
the system but, being unnatural, hence unbalancing, are weak-
ness, disease creating.

While a certain class of the public officials in America are,
judged by their activities, hell bent on adulterating the drinking
water of the American people with dangerous Toxic drugs, the
Supreme Court of Canada denies this privilege to the officials
of its water supply.

"Supreme Court Denies Metro Toronto's Right
to Fluoridate Water
"By CLARK DAVEY
"Globe and Mail Staff Reporter
"Ottawa, June 26.—The Supreme Court of Canada
has ruled that Metropolitan Toronto cannot add fluorine
compounds to the water which it supplies to the 13 munici-
palities which make up the metropolitan community.
"As Chief Justice Patrick Kerwin, who dissented,
noted in his judgment, the majority decision raises the
question whether the other municipalities in Ontario which
are already fluoridating their water actually have the
power to do so.
"The court's ruling was a 5-to-2 decision to dismiss
the appeal of Metropolitan Toronto against an Ontario
Appeal Court decision. The Ontario Court had reversed an
earlier decision by Mr. Justice F. G. MacKay, who had
ruled, in a case brought by Forest Hill against Metro, that
the senior municipality was entitled to add fluorine com-
pounds to its water supply.

4 Mr. Larrick and his coworkers are to be commended for
their efforts to have so many thousand pounds of "foods" taken

these food preparations were sold before their utter unfitness
for food purposes was discovered, and how many people became
afflicted with various diseases as a result of consuming them?
Perhaps an answer to this question would so horrify the people

5 What agreement is necessary? By whom should, or can any
agreement be made? Is it not the duty, sans agreements, for the
Congressmen and Senators to pass legislation that is for the pro-
tection of the people as a whole, whether constituents or not?
Did the people not elect them for this duty? If they fail, are they
not recreant to their oath of office?—one might truthfully say,

• Mr. Larrick and his coworkers are to be commended for
their efforts to have so many thousand pounds of "foods" taken
off the market each day. But how many thousands of pounds of
these food preparations were sold before their utter unfitness
for food purposes was discovered, and how many people became
afflicted with various diseases as a result of consuming them1
Perhaps an answer to this question would so horrify the people
that they would rise en masse for the punishment of these pur.
veyors of what is no less than disease creating filth.
5 What agreement is necessary? By whom should, or can any
agreement be made? Is it not the duty, sans agreements, for the
Congressmen and Senators to pass legislation that is for the pra.
tection of the people as a whole, whether constituents or not?
Did the people not elect them for this duty? If they fail, are they
not recreant to their oath of office?-one might truthfully say,
traitors to their fellow men, God and their country? What is
the answer?

Congress Must Act On Food Additives
Less than two years ago anyone who dared expose the
dangers of the many food additives was defamed by being called
a "crank, a faddist, a charlatan" and much, very much worse.
Any publication that dared print anything reflecting on
the dangers of the additives was either a "scandal sheet" or
"yellow." Times have changed. A magazine as widely read as
the Ladies' Home Journal, June 11, 1958 issue recognized the
danger and the necessity for protective legislation. We quote
in part, giving full credit:
"In recent years many hundreds of chemical sub-
stances have been developed and added to various proc-
essed foods to enhance or conserve color, flavor, texture or
nutritive1 quality. The Food and Drug Administration
considers" most of these additives harmless2 or beneficial
to the consumer. Another hundred or so are considered
harmless and safe in the amounts3 now being used.
1 There is a grave doubt whether any additive ever added
to any food product has nutritive value. In almost all instances
it is a synthetic product, and cannot be metabolized, hence a
liability, and not an asset to food.
2 They are considered as harmless, but no one has had the
courage of his convictions, and assumed responsibility for their
possible harmfulness. Those consuming such foods should care-
fully consider this fact.
3 There is no such thing as a safe amount of any poisonous
or cancerous producing substance. There is absolute and recog-
nized truth of this in the fact that any drug to be placed on the
market must first be tested to the satisfaction of a group of
physicians selected for the purpose, but food processors are
under no such protective restrictions.

that has been adulterated by one means or another, sometimes

eases. Unless there is a certainty that the butter is made from
pure, fresh cream, soy bean butter is to be preferred, containing
as it does, many elements the system is in need of, and butter
does not contain.
The same may be said of milk. Many people who are
allergic to animal milk and butter, readily and easily digest
soy bean milk.
Caution: We have lately received information that now
soy butter is also in some instances being adulterated with un-

Salt, used throughout the centuries for seasoning purposes,
has been roundly condemned. It is certain that being a mineral,

strongly counter-indicated. Everything considered, it is best to
use as little salt as possible. MORE DESIRABLE, substitute or-

Yoghurt is being more and more widely used. It is ques-

from raw, unadulterated milk. Such clabbered milk is rich in
the protein Casein and Lactic acid. Lactic acid helps to prevent
purification of some undigested protein food. As a preference,
we choose clabbered milk.

diet. Such sweets should be chosen in this order: Honey (much
of it is now adulterated), unrefined (of the blackstrap type)
molasses, fruit sugars, raw (unrefined) sugar. All refined sugars

OF ALL BASIC FOODS. These contain the ALL-IMPORTANT
Lecithin. THE LACK OF LECITHIN IN THE DIET is BELIEVED,
BY EXPERIENCED NUTRITIONISTS AND AN INCREASING NUM-
BER OF PHYSICIANS, TO BE THE CAUSE OF MUSCULAR DIS-
EASES, AND HARDENING OF THE ARTERIES, AND ITS PROPER
USE AS A HIGHIY VALUABLE REMEDY FOR SUCH DISEASES.
Caution: Soybeans, unless properly prepared, are extremely
difficult to digest. In preparation they should be soaked in warm
water for at least ten hours, then cooked or baked slowly until
soft. If thus prepared they are of greater value than meats;
due to their richness should be well combined with fresh vege-
table salads. Bread stuffs, rice and other starches should not be
consumed with Soybeans. Substitute boiled vegetables and the
salads.
The Oriental peoples, especially the Chinese, have always
been constant users of Monosodium glutamate on many of their
foods, especially all rice foods, and it is said that they have not
suffered from the numerous muscular diseases—dystrophies—
as do American adults and children. However, their mono-

table juices twice a day should be substituted and is amply suf-

or fruit juices possess the value the vegetables and fruits them-
selves do, due to the missing of the elements inherent in the
fibres.
Frozen foods, if unadulterated, are good food if properly
prepared. This is especially true of such foods as lima beans,
broccoli, and other vegetables. They are not as valuable nutri-
tionally as when fresh, but of greater value than many canned
goods in which preservatives are used. Canning, if done by a
heating process, or with preservatives, destroys vitamins, ESPE-
CIALLY THE VALUED VITAMIN C, which as far as known,
freezing does not.
Caution: In cases of colitis and ulcers, rough vegetables
should be most sparingly used. Instead, fresh vegetable juices
should be substituted. Where no fresh vegetables can be con-
sumed, six to eight ounces of well balanced vegetable jukes may
be used a day—tomato and carrot juices in minor quantities.
Citrus fruits, WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS, SHOULD NOT
BE EVEN HEATED, MUCH LESS BOILED. Dried prunes, raisins,
apricots and the like, should be soaked until soft, BUT NOT
BOILED. They may be soaked in what is called a "milk temper-
ature" water.
Cheese, if properly manufactured, is a good basic protein
food. The best cheese is what is generally known as home made
cottage chees* This can be used in many ways, more especially
as when mixed with cream as a vegetable dressing. Next in value
to cottage cheese, are the various "soft" cheeses. However, most
of these, to be free from adulteration, are imported and there-
fore expensive.
All cheese, with the exception of cottage cheese should
be used sparingly. The various "hard" cheese, even if unadulter-
ated, are more difficult to digest, and if the digestive juices are
weak, may pass only partly digested into the intestinal tract and
cause putrif ication.

cluded in the diet. This may be boiled as in soups the same as
okra, or boiled and served with drawn butter, or as a rice pud-
ding made with cream, raw sugar and a desired flavor. Un-
polished rice helps to prevent mineral deficiency diseases such
as the type of beri·beri.
All sea food, but especially oysters, clams and shrimp are
more desirable as protein than meats. However, they are more
difficult to digest and many people are allergic to sea food.
Those allergic must substitute such protein as eggs, legumes,

especially soybeans, lentils, large lima beans, baked bananas,
milk; cheese in moderation.
Poultry is classed as meat. Fish, poultry and meats are now
generally processed and adulterated with additives. Be on your
guard and refuse them unless assured of freedom from adulter-
ation and processing.
VITAMIN C. Much has been said of Vitamin C for two
reasons: Its great importance to well-being, and because prepa-
ration is liable to destroy the vitamin. Vitamin C is found in
most vegetables, corn and citrus fruit. If an additional amount
appears indicated, Vitamin C Complex (complex only) from
rose hips should be added to the diet
FRUITS, Cherries and Berries. These are rich in fruit sugar.
Examine canned cherries, and avoid as a plague those treated
with dye coloring.
AVOID PORK. Pork is admittedly a highly desirable protein
food, but it is dangerous, a carrier of parasites, unless cooked or
baked for a long time and at high t&mperature.
Avoid processed baking, frying fats. They are classed
as cancer producing. Substitute peanut oil, sunflower seed oil,
cocoanut oil. Some of these are now being adulterated. Watch
for this. The old fashioned farmer-rendered lard is not as unde-
sirable as marry of the fats now sold which have been processed
at high temperatures.
Even in this age of gross commercialism in the food con-
sumed by the mass, it is possible to arrange a well-balanced meal
that will (a) help to reestablish health in the ailing by supply-
ing them an abundance of vitamins and minerals in natural
awdenatured and ««adulterated foods, and (b) avoid processed,
adulterated and most, if not all, ready prepared (meals) foods.

ing denatured foods which no longer contained this element. It
is also a key element in nervous and mental conditions but must
be consumed in its natural state.
The foods richest in this element—Lecithin—as well as
other elements, are SOY BEANS, egg yolk, caviar, brain and other
animal organs. It is also abundant in wheat germ—in the wheat.
Strange, tOO, THAT IT IS BY NATURE COMBINED WITH THE
VITAMINS A, D, E, F, and K. Vitamin E is of great importance
in keeping the heart normal, or normalizing its action if there
is no organic fault.
Vitamin E is very rich in the wheat germ—in the wheat.
It is an essential in nerve normality. A German physician, Dr.
Evers, has found that Vitamin E was a successful remedy in the
treatment of multiple sclerosis, WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT
A LACK OF THIS VITAMIN is BASICALLY ONE OF THE MAIN
CAUSES FOR DISEASES OF THIS TYPE. The important fact is that
it is to be had in the simple foods such as RAW MILK, VARIOUS
SPROUTED GRASSES, ESPECIALLY OATS, UNadulterated honey,
raw or very slightly boiled eggs, and in UNtreated meats; meats
from animals not fed any of the additives. All these foods named
should form the basis of a normal, natural diet.
Vitamin A is an essential to good vision, to the gall bladder,
the teeth, bones and the digestive tract. This, like Lecithin and
Vitamin E is found in the simple foods which should form part
of the every day diet; butter, raw or lightly heated eggs, carrots
(in moderation), sweet potatoes and all greens, especially if
consumed raw.
The B Vitamins. These are especially important, but in
order not to be minus them, NO DENATURED FOOD SHOULD
FORM ANY PART OF THE DIET. The B Vitamins may be con-

when properly prepared and combined.
A simple diet, the breakfast of which consists of four
ounces of either fresh fruit or fresh vegetable juices, one or two
lightly boiled eggs and bread made from flour containing the
wheat germ, or substituting long-boiled oatmeal with light
cream, is a HEALTH breakfast. There are many substitutes.
A lunch composed of milk or soup, fresh vegetable salad
with cottage cheese dressing and a baked potato, or those who
desire, a meat, FRESHLY COOKED, in place of milk, contains all
needed elements. Here again there are many substitutes—
naturals—for the milk or soups.
The evening meal can be composed of a basic protein,
baked or steamed potato, at least one fresh vegetable and pos-
sibly two boiled vegetables, will supply the needed vitamins and
minerals.
The proteins to choose from are many, so are the vege-
tables and basic starches: brown rice, barley, okra in soup, pota-
toes and bread.
When all is said and done, for those who combine meat in
their diet, an old-fashioned meal of fifty years ago, consisting of
meat—either boiled or roasted—well combined with potatoes

high protein for the meat.1

A last word of warning: ALL FOODS SELECTED MUST BE
UNDENATURED AND UNADULTERATED. Your health and sanity
is worth this watchfulness.
DESSERT
Desserts are the abomination of a normal, healthy diet.
Why? Because they almost invariably are partaken of after
the diner is actually satisfied, hence they are congesting to the
system and not nourishing. If there must be desserts they
should be a choice of either rice pudding made of brown rice
and milk; egg custard made of eggs, milk and okra flour,
gelatin made with Knox gelatin, all may be flavored with
fruit flavor of choice; or baked apple and almonds. Any one
of these combined with milk or soup would serve as a perfect
lunch for sedentary workers.
family? I am able to buy a cheap cut of meat that I know is
properly fed and unprocessed and with potatoes, and a variety
of vegetables, prepare a dinner they enjoy and which, thus far,
has proven entirely satisfactory from the standpoint of health
as well as their satisfaction." Can you point out a better way
for me to follow?

THE HORRORS OF OUR MODERN AGE
The Age of Treason
The Age of Treason was published less than a year ago.
Almost the entire edition has been sold without a line of ad-
vertising in any form.
Dr. P., a physician, has this to say of the book:
'THE AGE OF TREASON is superb. As a book to awaken
the people and yet do not yourself condemn, but allow
the betrayers to condemn themselves is without precedent
in such literature."
An Editor:
"The Age of Treason," masterful new book by the dis-
tinguished scholar and patriot, Dr. R. Swinburne Clymer,
has recently been released by The Humanitarian Society.
This carefully prepared and handsomely printed book is
one which patriots will want in their own personal
libraries and which they will want to see placed on the
shelves of public and school libraries, as well.
'The title page carries a frank enlargement of the
title: The Carefully and Deliberately Planned Methods
Developed by the Vicious Element of Humanity for the
Mental Deterioration and Moral Debasement of the Mass
as a Means to Their Enslavement.' Following this candid
statement, the author points out that a vicious undercover
war is indeed being waged against the American people,
and announces, The express intent therefore of this text
is to expose these methods, that those who will may protect
themselves and their families by means of sane, Divinely-
indicated methods at the command of all men and women.'
