  		              		Experience Description   

    On October 08, 2020 I went to a local emergency room due to being sick for a few days, and worried that I might have Covid-19. All Covid-19 tests came back negative and no reason could be found for my illness. I was then sent to a local hospital to have testes done on my heat due to several abnormal ECG tests that were done at the emergency room service. 
  
  After two days in the hospital nothing could be found wrong with my heart. To be sure all was well my doctor and I decided that we would do a heart catheterization. During the procedure the dye that was injected did not go where it was supposed to due to an extra artery that I have. The doctor then injected another dose of dye into my heart. At that time my heart began to quiver. The nurses and doctor began to yell at me, telling me to cough. I tried to cough but then passed out.
  
  Immediately, I came to be in a large open space. The ground was like a pure blueish colored jewel or glass. The air was filled with a sort of bluish swirling fog or haze. I saw figures form and then dissipate within the fog. There was a horizon very far away but in this horizon was a brilliant pure light. It was as bright as a star but did not hurt my eyes. I knew that this light was God and Jesus, and could feel the Holy Spirit flowing through everything. 
  
  I was escorted by a large being. I felt like this being was very powerful but it did not scare me. When we moved we seemed to glide from place to place and the being did not turn as we moved but always faced me. It did not have a face but like the souls in the fog was just there. Like a silhouette. It showed me the throne of God, and then it showed me two tall pillars. The pillars seemed to be made of stone and they rose up forever. There was what seemed to be vines or writing on the pillars. Beyond the pillars was a walkway that resembled a low bridge. I do not recall where this bridge went to.

  While we were moving, souls would come up to me. The only two that I remember were my grandparents who had died some years before. I remember the feeling from them was reassurance that everything was OK.
  
  During my time there, it felt as if I were there for  hours. Although I was clinically dead for 5 minutes. I felt a great sense or peace and love. I could tell that this feeling flowed from the bright light which is God/Jesus. I could also see the Holy Spirit flowing through everything in the form of golden rays, if that makes sense. Everything else was a shade of blue. The only color was The bright light that was God, and the rays from him that was the Holy Spirit.
  
  After what seemed like hours I was told that I had to go back. I said that I wanted to stay but the large being lifted what would have been hands and pushed me back to this world.

  The whole time I was there, this being was talking to me. I received knowledge and instructions, but I cannot remember exactly what it was.
  
  I failed to mention that no audible sounds or words were spoken. Everything was conveyed as feelings. I could feel everyone's thoughts all at once. As if I was plugged into some heavenly network. It was amazing.
