treatifes on this celeftial Science j
an'd many
of them have clogged their performances
with infuperable diniculties, and- wrote ifi
fuch an ambiguous ftyle, that manyiperfons
have been difcouraged from engaging-in it^
and others, from the vulgar idea that it is
pregnant with impolture, and aided’ by dia-
bolical compadl : but nothing can»be more-
abfurd, or remote from the truth^ than
thefe fuppoficions. To aOift both Claires’,
and remote ambiguit\' and error,, this, pre-

founded on ftriel truth and morality,, and is
governed by rules and obfervations- made-
from the portions and afpefts of tlie planets
;
which if duly obferved, and properly lludied,
it will be found an unerring Science. No-
thing but the general ignorance of it, has
made it myllerious and wonderful. In this

intereft or reputation. In refpeft to this
noble Science, many perlbns entertain the
higheft prejudices againft it; but they are
thole who have borrowed their objedlions,
a-nd not thofe who by an inveftigation of the
Art have found it either impious or pre-
fumptuous ; but I muft confefs, that ignorant
and illiterate perfons daily bring difgrace
on this Science by impofing on the cre-
dulous, and confequently prejudicing the
minds of men againft it. Our limits will
not permit us to fay much in defence of it
I lhall endeavour to advance only a few
arguments in its fupport.
The Science of Aftrology is nothing
more than the ftudy of Nature, the know-
ledge of the fecret virtues of the Heavens,
and may be attained by common diligence; ;
and the more we delight in it, the more i
readily do we forefee the motions of future I
events, and attain to the knowledge' of I
things which are paft : and by knowing the I
time of our birth, we are enabled to read
in the Heavens the ftory of our whole lives,
blefiings and crofles, ficknefs and health,
jirofperity and adverfity, and time of our
death ; even as though we had feen them
tranlacled ; for God has given this know-
ledge to the wife man, to hio%v the time

Sreat foundation for the truth of this Sci-
ence : we read, God faid. Let there be light
in the firmament of the heavens, to divide the
day from the night and let them be for figns
and for feafons, for days and for years.
To whom could they be for figns? Not ta
brutes, but to men, who are capable of dif-
tinguifhing them, and improving by them.
Can we, if we allow ourfelves leifure to
think, fuppofe that God made thofe glorious
bodies, many of which are larger than the
whole earth, and move in their orbs as fo
many other worlds, merely to twinkle in the

have their courfcs. and bring to

phers were unanimous in luolcnbmg to this
opinion, and many learned authors tn later
ages have lupported the fame dodtrine.
Mikon gives us a very ftriking proof of nis
belief of the ftarry influence, in his Parar
dife Loll, B. X. 1 . 656 :
“ 'I'o the blank moon

The Deity has implanted, even in the
brute creation,, a gift of fore-knowledge :
the badger, hedge-hog, mole, the hare, fox,
&c. birds and reptiles, alfo, have an ad-
mirable forecaft. Cun we fuppofe that Di-
vine Providence has not in an infinite
greater degree ordained a means of conir
municating a fore-knowledge to man'-' ?

This ciodtrine Teems to be founded upon
that miraculous fympathy in nature whlcb
is admirably manifcded between the Moon
and the Sea, by which that ainazing body
of water is conftantly drawn after her,
though.no man fees nor can conceive how»
In thefe fympathies there can be no doubc-
but the vegetative foul of the world invihbly
carries and unites a fpecific virtue from the
Heavens between one thing and another,
every where working thofe fecret effe6t» ,
which no mortal can tail to admire and in
'
the prefent cafe, who is to determine what i
this foul cannot effeft between the heavenly
bodies and the animal fpirit of man, work-
ing fuch fympathies, as that a queftion of’
importance to our welfare cannot ftart from
the mind but in a point of time when the
planets and figns governing the perfon’s
birth are afling upon the fubjeft that en--
gages his thoughts and attention ? And
hence the birth of the queilion, like the na-
tivity of a child, carries the ftory of the’
whole matter on its forehead. And if it
be eflTential to man’s welfare to be fore--
warned of the iime ami the judgement,, as So--
lomon declares it is, and that the ‘zvife ma,n\
fhall kncnv it*, then it is plain the Great Be-

ledge without a miracle ; and thefe means-

traneous matter inftrted in the firft impref-
fion. I fhall briefly obferve to my candid
Readers the antiquity of this fcience : Jo-
fephus mentions that the Patriarchs practifed
it j after that the Chaldeans, Egyptians, and
Arabians: and it is certain it is in prefent
ule among thePerfians ; the modern hiftory

ment principally from the Moon, and feem
much to regard the tarth. The reafon that
the Aftrologers have more (kill here than
elfewhere, is, we are told, becaufe the Air
is drier, and purer; by which means they j
have a better opportunity of obferving the
motions and afpedls of the Stars. This i

dies; and a perfon is looked upon to the ,

Without troubling my Readers with a:

tedious Preface, I think the beft and fureft ^
mode of conquering the prejudices of every

The Explanation i$ the Frontispiece.
According to the definition of the Twelve Houfc*
of Heaven, delcribed by that mod learned and excellent
philolbpher MorinuSy the Life of Man may be- divided into
four didinit periods, or ages, in f«mc meafure agreeable to
the Plate ;
njinr,. Th« firfl: Figure denotes Infancy j
the next
fignifics ToiUh j
oppofitc to Youth is a figure of Maturity,
or Marriage y
above that is a ftriking embkm of O.a Age,
E. VV. N. S. the foitr Quarter* of Heaven. The figure
of a Man on Horfeback denotes ;
the Ship, Trade
and Commerce. The Sun in the center, according to Co-
pernicus. Dragon's Head and Tail, Wheel of Fortune,
and the Earth, indiferiminately placed about the Center,
The Planets are each placed in their own Houfes, as Jupiter
in Pifees, &c. The Signs are emblematically placed on the
Cufps or Lines of the Houfes. In the conftruftion of Maa
we difeover four Affeclions, vii. Life, Antony Marriage, and
PaJJion ;
tht-fe agiec with the Rife, Perfeilion, Declination,
and Termination, of all Things, and comprife the whole
Etfecl* and Operations of Nature. But to be brief ; Life,
in the Syftem of Nature, is regulated by the Eall angle of
the Heavens, called the Afcendant ;
Action, by the South
angle, or Mid Heaven; Marriagey by the Weft angle; and
Pajfxon, by the North angle of the Heavenly Frame : And
hence aiife four Triplicities of the fame genus or gcnerical
nature, and twelve Houfes. The firft Triplicity is of the
Eaftern angle, attributed to Infancy, called the Triplicity of
Life, and includes the ift, 9tb, and 5th Houfes, which behold
each other in a partile Trine. The fecund Triplicity conlifts
of the angle of the Mid Heaver, 6th and 2d Houfes; this
appertains to Vigour and AiSfion. The third Triplicity has
the government of the yth, 3d, and nth Koufes ;
in this
dstage of Life, Man is joined in a Tie or Obligation, inBodv,
in Blood, and in Friendjhip. The foin tli and laft Triplicity
is that of Palfion, and includes In it the 4.th, 12th, and 8ih
ffoufes ;
and thefe conftitute, as well as the reft, a p^itlle
Brine in the Equator: it comprehends the three clatTes of
human afflictions; Decay ot Life, Sonow, and Death.
Wherefore, according to the fecond motion of tlie Planets,
from Weft to Eaft, an entrance is made out of the 8th into
the 9th Houfe, which it the Houfe of Life in GOD, where
(the imiuona! Spij it muft return to that Divine Being wK»
• gave it, fee.

I
FAMILIARISED.
PART THE FIRST.
To find a method of conveying our ideas in
fuitable expreflions, adapted to the capacity of
every reader, has been found very difficult by
rooft authors ; but, if plainnefs and familiarity
of llyle can be of any utility in this work, it is
determined to be as clear and intelligible as pof-
fible; wifiiing to .give the weakeft minds affift-
ance, and enable thofe who have but a fmall
fhare of education, to acquire a competent de-
gree of knowledge in this Art.
The conftellations of fiars which form thft
'
twelve figns of the Zodiac, have a more powerful
and obvious iniluence on man, than any of the
other fixed ftars ; and the reafon is, becaufe they
B form
t ^ ]
form the pathway of tlie fun, moon, and planet'^,
In all their peregrinations ;
and thereby receive
from them a more powerful force and energy.
And as thefefigns form a confidcrable part of r.he
fcience of Aflrology, we iliall confid r them under
iheir various qualities and affedlioits, both with
rcfpe£i; to their operation upon man’s body, and
upon the four fcafons of the year. Tlicl'e figns
are known or diftinguillied by the following
charafters

*V’ Aries gs Cancer sctLibra
h Taurus SI Leo nxHcorpio
ji Gemini 1^ Virgo t Sagitt.;ry
! WlnterQjjarter.
itf Capricorn
Aquaries
Xi^ifecs.
They are placed in this order, and divided intO'
four equal parts, anfwering to the four quarters
of the year; becaufe the Equator cuts and divides,
the circle of the .Zodiac at the point beginning at.
Aries, and at the oppofite point Libra, dividing;
the whole into two equal parts, confifting of fix!
northern, and fix fouthern figns. But the reafoni
why the Sun s courfe begins, and is reckoned frorni
Aries, as tiadiiion infornit. us, is, the Sun, w'heni
brought into exigence, was placed in thisfign::
and this is a very rational conjeaure, fince'the
‘ quarter begins when the Sun enters Aries,,
and brings with it increafe and length of days ;;
all
[ 3 ]
all Nature then begins to multiply and flourifh,
and alTumcs, as it were, a new refurrcdlion.
Thefe fix northern fip-ns terminate with V^irf^'o;
and the fix fouthern commence with Libra. The
northern figns have always been confidered of a
mofe efficacious and noble nature than the fouth-
'
ern. Philofophers have alfo alfigned other reafuns,
which are beyond our limits to mention.
We will now arrange the figns of the T^ooiac
under all their different qualities and forms;

parts, called degrees; each degree divided irfto

The foregoing Table is highly 'Ccceflary to be
underftbod by every Student in Ajlrology,
In the firft column, next to Aries, you find
8 . 15 .
30
;
and in the 2d column, againft Aries,
you find 9 . 22 ;
which intimates that the firfi:
8 deg. of Aries are mafeuline, the 9th feminine
;
from 9 to 15 mafeuline, from 15 to 22 feminine,
from 22 to 30 mafeuline fo of the reft.
In the 4th column, under Degrees light,
againft Aries, you find 8 • 20 .
29
;
and in the
5th column, againft Aries, you find 3.16; which
Ihews that the firft
3 degrees of ^ are dark, from
3 to 8 are light, from 8 to 16 are dark, and from
16 to 20 are light, &c. The 8th, 9th, and loth
columns exhibit the degrees of the Ecliptic that
are deep or pitted, lame, deficient, or azimene,
and thofe degrees which increafe Fortune, as the
title diredfs. The ufe is as follows :
When a queftion is propofed concerning theft,
if the thief be a man or woman ? —or if a woman
with child, if conceived of a boy or girl ? When
the teftimonies of your figure arc equal, then
confider the degrees of the Cufps of your Houfes
relating to the queftion, and the degrees wherein
you find the principal fignificator3 and if the
majo
[ 8 ]
major part of them be in degrees mafculine, it is
a male i if feminine, a female, ^c.
If the degrees afcending in a nativity or que-
ftion, ferioufly propounded, be thofe which are
termed light, the perfon fignified thereby will be
more clear and fair ;
if dark, &c. the complexion
dark, cloudy, &c.
If the degrees afcending are termed void, the
perfon will be of a weak underftanding, and de-
ficient in judgement.
If the degrees afcending, or the principal fig-
nificator, be deep or pitted, it denotes the querent
or native will be imperfedl in body or mind, or
both.
When you find any of the degrees, &c. as be-
fore, lame, Szc. the perfon reprefentcd is defedlive
in fome part of the body; crooked, lame, or
blind, $ic.
If you find the Cufp of the 2d Houfe, or the
Lord of the 2d, or the Part of 0 ,
or his Lord,
or Jupiter, it is an argument of much wealth,
and promifes much good, if they ar« in any of
thofe degrees that increafe fortune.
Of

Of the Nature and Qualities of the T-wehe
SIGNS.
EACH of the figns poflefies a particular effi-
cacy and virtue peculiar to itfelf, or to that part
of the Heavens wherein 'it bears rule : for as,
upon Earth, all ground will not bring forth the
fame fruit ; fo in the Heavens, all places or parts
thereof will not produce the fame effedls. Upon
the Earth, a man in his journey rides over ten
miles, more or lefs, upon the fands ; another time,
fome miles upon the clays j at another time, ten
miles upon marie and gravel. Similar to this,
by the moil accurate obfervations, appears to be
the alternate variation of the heavenly matter;
as our Reader will fee apparent in every fign of
the Zodiac. And, firft, of
ARIES V.
This fign, both obfervatlon and experience
inform us, is hot and dry. It is an equinodfial,
mafeuline, cardinal, diurnal, moveable, fiery,
choleric, luxurious, violent fign, oriental, and of
the fiery Triplicity ; it is the Day-houfe of Mars,
the exaltation of the Sun, and the Triplicity of
Sol and Jupiter; it confifts of thirteen ftars, and
is a beftial fign,
Firfi:,

[ 10 I
Firft, This fign, when it afcends In a quefllojii
or nativity, defcribes a perfon of a mean ftaturc,,
lean and dry body, ftrong and large bones and
limbs, piercing eyes, a fwarthy or fallow com-*
plexdon, fandy-coloured hair, or light. The lirft'
part of the fign gives the body more grofs or:
fat than the latter. This fign inclines a man toi
anger, but makes him witty, ingenious, and quick,
of apprehenfion. If Saturn or Mars are there,,
it is altered for the worfe ; if Jupiter or Venus,,
for the better. If the planets or their afpedts
fall ftrongly into a fign, they quite change its>
nature and effects ; if none of thefe happen, thent
the fign Aries, and the reft, unalterably purfue:
their own nature.
Secondly, The difeafes produced by this figw,,
are, fmall-pox, falling-ficknefs, apoplexies, head-
ache, all difeafes of the head and face, hair-lip,,

and the ruling colour is white mixed with red*.
* All the empires, kingdoms, and cities, in the world, are
under the twelve Signs and feven Planets j
we therefore arc not
at all lurprlfcd at the political Aftrologers being fo egreciouliy
midaken in their prediftions. 1 am lure it is the opinion of
many, that it is mere geomantic-like lot. 1 fhall omit the names
of countries, and pafs on,

Readers, that the foregoing influences attributed!
to the twelve figns of the Zodiac, are merely con--
jeifural and imaginary ; but the artift that has the*
good fenfe to determine for himfelf, by the flran—
clard of experience and obfervation only, will care-
fully attend to all that has been Rated, as the.
particular effeft and virtue of each refpedfive fign;;
for without a ftridf intimacy with them, no correft.
judgement can be formed upon any nativity : andl
it is alfo of great ufe in* horary queftions. If the’
foregoing rules are attended to, no one who trieS'
them will ever find an error in his calculation.

SATURN ^
Saturn is the moft fupreme or moft elevated of
the planets, being placed between Jupiter and
the

the firmament, at about ySOjOOOj'boo miles from
the Sun. It travels in its orb, at the rate oi
18.000 miles every hour j and performs its annual
revolution round the Sun, in 29 years,. 167 days^
and 5 hours, of our time ;
which makes onl),
one year to that planet. And though it appears:
to us no larger than a ftar of the third magnitude.*
yet its diameter is found to be no lefs thar:
67.000 Englifh miles; and, confequently, neai
600 times as large as the Earth. This planet Ij:
furrounded by a thin, broad ring, fomewhat re-;
fembling the horizon of an artificial globe ;
anc.
it appears double, when feen through a gooe,
telefcope. It is inclined 30 degrees to the Eclip'
tic, and is about 21,000 miles in breadth ; which
is equal to its diftance from Saturn, on all fidesi
but having no vifible fpots on his body, whereb-
to determine the time of his turning round it*
axis ;
the length of its days and nights, and th
pofition of its axis, are wholly unknown to us-
He is retrograde 140 days; and ftationary 5 day
before, and 5 days after, rctrogradation.
Saturn is in nature cold and dry, being fo fa
remote from the Sun ; abounds in moift vapours^
is a melancholy, earthy, mafeuline, folitary, diur
nal, malevolent planet ; and the greater Inforr
tune. He naturally reprefents one of a middl

hair, broad fhoulders, thin beard, with fmall
thighs and legs. When he is well dignified, the
perfon fignified by Saturn will be of an acute and
penetrating underftanding, grave, and fober, ma-
naging all his concerns with difcretion ; and in
his condua auftere and rigid. When he is ill
dignified, the native or querent will be covetous,
fordid, jealous 3 a diflembling, lying, malicious
perfon 3 perpetually di/Tatisfied with himfelf and
'
all about him. When Saturn is oriental in a
^
nativity, or queftion folemnly propounded, the
auman ftature will be Ihorter than ufual 5 and
when occidental) thin, lean, and lefs hairy : if
bis latitude be north, the native will be hairy,
‘‘and corpulent 3 if without any latitude, he will
'
-lave large bones and mufcles3 and if meridional
'|)r fouth, fat, fmooth, and flelhy3 in his firfi:
lation, ftrong and well-favoured 3 in his fecond
btion, weak and ill-favoured. Thefe remarks,
he Reader will obferve, hold good with refpect
0 all the other planets. Obferve further, when
aturn is fignificator of travelling, he betokens
mg and laborious journies, perilous adventures,
'^i^d dangerous confinement.
Saturn
[ 24 ]
Saturn governs the fpleen, right car, bones,
teeth, joints, and retentive faculties in man j and
rules every thing bitter, fharp, or acrid.
Difeafes under Saturn are, melancholy andl*
nervous affe<£lions, quartan agues, falling ficlc--!
nefs, black jaundice, tooth-ache, leprofy,
tulas, pains in the limbs and joints, gout, rheu--l
matifm, hemorrhoides, deafnefs, infanity, palfy,,|]
consumption, dropfy, chin-cough, fractures, apo--i<
plexies, and all phlegmatic humours. In con--i
ception it rules the firft and eighth months.

I
Saturn brings cloudy, dark, obfcure weather ;J
with cold, fharp winds, and a thick, heavy air:,
thefe are his general effeds. He delights in the;
eaftern corner of the Heavens, and brings the
eaftern winds.
It would be extending the limits of our work.^
too far, to dcfcribe the herbs, plants, animals,
ftones, &c. under each planet ; we fhall of courfe^
proceed in as concife and familiar a manner as
this glorious fubjed will admit of.

Venus; and is of a bright refplendent clear afpea:.
Modern Altronomers have proved him to be
426jOOOjOOO of miles from the Sun ; and above
looo times bigger than our Earth : he goes In
his Orbit at the allonifliing rate of near 26,000
miles an hour; and his diameter is computed at
18,000 Engllfli miles, which is more than ten
times the diameter of the Earth : he completes
his courfe through the twelve Signs of the Zodiac *
Jn II yeais, 514 days, and 12 hours. He is con-

perlors, and a tyrant In his own family. If the
planet be oriental at a birth, the native will be
more ruddy, with larger eyes, more corpulent,
and generally have a mole or mark upon the right
foot; if occidental, then it beftows a moft fair,
lovely complexion, particularly to a female ;
the
nature fhorter; the hair light brown or tlaxen.

Difeafes under Jupiter, are all infirmities of
the liver, obftruflions, pleurifies, apoplexies,
inflammation of the lungs. Infirmities of the
heart and ear, back and reins, head, pulfe, feed,
arteries, and convulflons. In generation he go-
verns the fecond and ninth months.

in -686 days and 4 hours, wliicli is the exaft
length of his year, and contains 667 1 days ; but
every day and night is 40 minutes longer thaw
with us. His diameter is 4444 miles, which is
but a fifth part fo large as the Earth : he is of a
^eep-red fiery colour, and Teems to be encom-
pafied by a very grofs atmofphere.
Mars is a mafculine, nc£lurnal planet ; in
nature hot, and dry; choleric, and fiery; the
lefler in fortune ; author of quarrels, diflenfions,
firife, war, and battle; and rules the gall, left
car, head, and face; fmell, imagination, and at-
tra£five faculty, in man.
He reprefents a perfon of a ftrong, well-fet
body, of fhort ftature, but large bones ; rather
lean than fat; a brown, ruddy complexion; red,
flaxen, or light-brown hair ; round face ; fliarp,
hazleeyes; a confident, bold countenance; active
and intrepid. Vv^hen he is well dignified, the
perfon fignified by him will inherit a courageous,
invincible difpofition, carelefs of danger, hazard-
ing his life on all occafions, fo that he can but
triumph over his enemy or antagonift
;
yet pru-
dent in his private concerns : but when ill dig-
nified, he will delight in quarrels; in danger of
committing murder; of robbing on the hio^hvvav *

of becoming a tlilef, traitor, or incendiary ;
of
a turbulent i'pirit ;
rafli, inhuman, treacheious ,,
fearing neither God nor man ;
given up to every
fpcciescf fraud, violence, cruelty, and injufiice..
If the planet Mars is oriental at the nativity,,
the native will be above the middle ftaturc;,
very hairy, and of a clearer complexion, ift
occidental, he will be fliort, more ruddy, withi
a fniall head, yellow hair, and a dry conflitution.
Difeafes under Mars, are peftilential fevers,,
plagues, tertian agues, jaundice, all hot and!
feverifli complaints in the head, bloody flux,,
flftulas, difeafes of the genitals, wounds of all
forts, ftone, 6cc. See. When flgnificator of a’
journey, he portends danger of robbery, lofs of*
life, and other accidents.
THE MOON D.
The Moon is next below Mars, being a fatel—
lite or attendant on the Earth ;
and goes round I
it, from change to change, in 29 days, 12 hours,,
and 44 minutes ;
and round the Sun witli It every
year. '1 he Moon’s diameter is 2180 miles; andl
her diftance from the Earth’s centre is 240,000
miles : flie goes round her orbit in 27 days,,
7 hours, and 43 minutes, moving above 2290
miles
[ 29 J
miles every hour; ami turns round her axis
exaftly in the time Hie goes round the earth ;
wliich is the reafon of her always keeping the
fame fide towards us ;
and that her day and night
taken together are as long as our lunar month.
She is an opaque or dark body, like the Earth,
and fhincs only by reflefting the light of the
Sun; therefore, whilft that half of her which is
toward the Sun is enlightened, the other part muft
be dark and invifible. Hence ihe difappears when
fhe comes between us and the Sun , becaufe her
dark fide is then towards us. When Hie is orone
O
a little way forward, we fee a little of her en-
lightened fide, which Hill increafes to our view
as fhe advances forward, until Hic comes to be
oppofite the Sun; and then her whole enlightened
fide is, towards the Earth, and Hic appears with
a round, illumined orb, which we call the Full
Moon; her dark Hde being then turned away
from the Earth. From tlie full file feems to
decreafe gradually as Hic goes through the other
half of her courfe, Hiewing us lefs and lefs of
her enlightened Hde every day, till her next
change or conjunftion with the Sun; and then
Hie difappears, as before.
The Moon is a feminine, nodurnal, cold,
moiH, and phlegmatic planet : her influence in
j herfelf
[ 30 ]
licrfelf is neither fortunate nor unfortunate, but
as llie falls in with the configurations, or afpefts,
of other planets. And under thcfe circuinftances
die becomes the moft powerful of all the hea-
venly bodies, in her operations, by rcafon of
her proximity or nearnefs to the Earth, and the
fwiftnefs of her motion; by which flie receives
and tranfmits to us the light and influence of all
the fuperiors, by her configurations with them.
She denotes one of a large flature, fair or pale
complexion, round face, grey eyes, lowering
brow, very hairy, fhort arms, thick hands and
feet ;
inclined to be fat, corpulent, and phlegma-
tic. If file be impedited of the Sun at the time
of birth, Ihe leaves a blemilh in or near the eye;
when oriental, inclineth to corpulency ;
if occi-
dental, Icanncfs, and ill formed. When file is.
well dignified, flie makes a perfon of engaging ^
manners, and fond of novelties and travelling;,
callly frightened, yet a foft, tender, well-difpofedl
perfon : if ill dignified, then fhe reprefents am
idle, drunken, beggarly perlon, hating labour,,
and of a mean fpirit.
Difeafes incident to the AToon, arc, the palfy,,
complaints in the bowels, ftone and gravel’;’
ebllru^lions in women, dropfy, fluxes; cold,,

rheumatic complaints ;
worms, diforders in the
eyes, linall-pox, lethargy, vertigo, lunacy, &c.
In conception file rules the feventh month; and
governs the brain, the flomach, bowels, bladder,
left eye in man, right eye in woman,
VENUS $.
Venus is the next planet below the Earth and
Moon, having her orbit within that of the Earth.
She is computed to be 59 millions of miles from
the Sun ;
and by moving at the rate of 69,000
miles every hour, flic palTes through the twelve
figns of the Zodiac in 224 days, 1 7 hours, nearly,
of our time. Her diameter is 7906 miles ;
and
by her diurnal motion fhe is carried about her
equator 43 miles every hour, befidcs the 69,000-
above mentioned. When fhe appears weft of the
Sun, file rifes before him in the morning, and is
called the morning-ftar ;
but when file appears
eaft of the Sun, file ftiines in the evenins: after
he fets, and is then called the evening-ftar; and
continues alternately in each of thefe pofttions
the fpace of 290 days. It may be thought fur-
prifing, atftrft, that Venus fhould continue longer
on the eaft or weft fide of the Sun, than the whole
time of her period round him. This difficulty
will vanilli when we confidcr the Earth is all the
,
while
[ 32 ]
wliile going round the Sun, tlie lame way, though
not lb quick, as Venus ;
and therefore, her rela-
tive motion to the Earth mul>, in every period,,
be as much llowcr than her abfolute motion in;
her orbit, as the Earth, during that time, ad--
vances forward in tlie Ecliptic, which is 220 de--
grees. To us flic appears, through the telcfcope,.
in all the various fliapes of the Moon.
Venus is a feminine planet, temperately cold
and moift; the lelTer Fortune; author of mirth',
and pleafure ;
alluring to procreation. She de—
feribes one of a hancllbme, well- formed, but nof
tallflature; fine complexion ;
lovely, dark, bright
eyes; face round, and delightful; eye naturally
amorous; light hair; and inclined to early en--
gagements in love. When Ihe is well dignihed,.
the perfon lignihed thereby will be of a quiet,,
even, friendly dilpofition; naturally inclined to
neatnefs ;
loving mirth, and delighting in mufic ;;
amorous ;
prone to venery, though truly virtuous ;;
if a woman, fhewill be inclined to jealoufy, event
without any caufe.
If the planet is ill dignified, it reprefents a.
perfon uotous, profligate, a lover of lewd women
regardlcls of credit or reputation ;
a frequenter of
taverns, and houles of vice; dclightintr in all in—
' 00citements
r 33 ]
cltements to adultery and Inceft; in principtes aft
atlieill:. If Venus is lignificator of journies, file
promifes plealure, profit and fafety. If flic is
oriental, the ftature will be tall and upright; if
occidental, fliort and {looping, but comely.
Difeafes of Venus ; all diforders of the belly
and womb, fuffocation, palpitation, heart-burn,
h, diflocation, priapifm, impotency, diabetes, vene-
real complaints, and all difeafes of the genitals,
kldnies, reins, navel, back, and loins.
MERCURY
Next to Venus, and within the orbits of all
the other planets. Is Mercury, and of courfe the
neareft of them all to the central Sun. He com-
pletes his revolution in 87 days and 23 hours of
our time, nearly, which is the length of his year j
but beingfeldom feen, on account of his proximity
to the Sun, and having no vifible fpots on his
fuiface or diflc, the time of his rotation upon his
own axis, and the length of his days and nights,
are yet unknown to us. His diftance from the
Sun is computed to be 32 millions of miles; and
his diameter 2600; he moves round the Sun
95^000 miles every hour, and receives from that
luminary a proportion of light and hear, near
feven
[ 34 I
leven times as great as that of the Earth. At
the time he becomes vifible, he appears of a bright, J
lilver colour, though generally faint and dulklihrt
to the naked eye; and is never more than 27J’
degrees from Sol.
Mercury is the leaft of all the planets ;
ir
nature cold, dry, and melancholy ; he is either,
mafeuline or feminine, lucky or unlucky, as his
pofition in the heavens happens to be ;
or he is Ir 1
afpeft with other planets evil and mifchievouSr,|
when in conjundlion with. Infortune. He repre-f"
fents a perfon of a tall, llraight, thin, fpare body
narrow face; long, flraight nofe ;
thin lips anc.
chin ;
little beard ;
brown complexion ; hazle orl
chefnut hair; arms, hands, and fingers, long anef'
ilender; thighs, legs, and feet, the fame. Ir]
orientally pofited, the ftaturc will be fliorter, witl
fandy hair, fomewhat fun-burnt, and fanguine!-
If occidental, the complexion will be quite faU*^'
low, lank limbs, hollow eyes, of a red call, ant
dry conftitutlon.
If it is well dignified, in any quefllon or nair,
tlvity, the perfon will inherit a firong, fubtl
imagination, and retentive memorv ; likely t I.
become an excellent orator and logician; might’'
in eloquence anu perluahon, and ot an incoin'i
parabl ,,
r 35 J
parable unclerftanding. But if the' planet be 111
dignified, he will be a flanderer, boafter, liar,
fycophant, though a mere ideot ; incapable of
acquiring any fubftantial learning; very much
addi£lcd to petty theft.
Difeafes : all'diforders of the brain; vertigoes,
madnefs, dcfe£fs of memory, convulfions, afth-
mas ;
imperfedlions of the tongue, dumbnefs,
gout, and whatever impairs the intelleftual fa-
culties. In conception he governs ‘the fixth
month.
SOL 0.
Sol, or the Sun, is an immenfe globe or body
Df fire placed in the common centre, or rather in
;he lower focus of the orbits, of all the planets
!ind comets; and turns round his axis in 25 days
ind 6 hours ; as is evident by the motion of the
pots vilible on His furface. His diameter is com-
>uted to be 76,300 miles; and by the various
ttraftions of the circumvolving planets, he is
gitated by a fmall motion round the centre of
;ravity in the fyllem. He pafles through the
welve figns of the Zodiac in 365 days, 5 hours,
•8 minutes, 57 feconds ; which forms the tropi-
|al or folar year ;
by which fiandard all our pe-
5ods of time are meafured. He conftantly moves
in
[ 3^ ]
in the Ecliptic, and is void of latitude; of courfe,
is never ftationary or retrograde. In man lu
governs the heart, back, and arteries ;
the righi
eye of male, and left of the female ;
and tlu
memory. ,
The Sun is in nature mafcullne, diurnal, hof
and dry, but more temperate than Mars ;
and i-
well dignified, is always found equivalent to on.
of the Fortunes. When he prefides at a birth
the native is generally of a large, boney, ftronc
body; of a fallow, fun-burnt complexion ;
largec
high forehead ;
with light or fandy, curling haiw
inclined to be foon bald; a fine, full, piercing
hazle eye; and all the limbs ilraight, and welh
proportioned.
If he is well dignified, either in a queftion c
nativity, the perfon will be of a noble, magna:
nimous, and generous dlfpofition ; high-mindec-
butvery humane; benevolent heart ; affable; i
friendfliip faithful and fincere ;
in promlfes flow
but punftual. The folar man is not of man
words ;
but when he fpeaks, it is with confidenc(
and to the purpofe : he is ufually thoughtfu
fccret, and referved : his deportment is ftaiel
and majeftie ;
a lover ot fumptuoufnefs and mac.
nificence ; and pofTefles a mind far Superior 1
any lordid, bafe, or difltonourablc pradlices.
[ 37 ]
If the Sun be ill dignified, then will the native
be born of a mean, loquacious difpofition ; proud,
and arrogant; difdaining all his fuperiors, though
a fycophant to them ; of a fhallow ui^derflanding
and judgement; reftlefs, troublefome, and domi-
neering; of no gravity in his condu«5l; prone to
cruelty, mifchief, and ill-nature. <
Difeafes of the Sun ; all palpitations and
tremblings of the heart; fainting and fwodning;
weaknefs of fight; violent fevers; choler ; dif-
orders of the brain ; cramp; foul breath; difor-
ders of the mouth and throat ; catarrhs ; and
king’s evil. In conception, he prefides over the
fourth month.
•
THE DRAGON’S HEAD g,
‘
AND
DRAGON’S TAIL gj.
The Head of the Dragon is mafculihe, par-
taking of the nature of both Jupiter and Venus;
but the Dragon’s Tad is feminine, and of a di-
rea- oppofite quality to the Head. Thefe are
neither figns nor conftellations, but are qnly the
.nodes or points wherein the Ecliptic is interfeaed
.by the orbits of the planets, and particularly that
•of the Moon ; making with it angles of 5 degrees,
18 minutes. One of thefe points looks northward,
T the
[ 38 ]
the Moon beginning then to have northern lati-
tude j and the other points louthward, where fh©
commences her fouth latitude. But it muft b®
obferved, that thefe points do not always abide im
one place, but have a motion df their own in the;
Zodiac, and retrogradewife 5 minutes ii feconds^
per day; completing their circle in i8 years and.
225 days ;
fa that the Moon can be but twice irr
the Ecliptic .during her monthly period ;
but at
all other times ftie will have a latitude or declina-
tion from the Ecliptic.
Mr. Lilly fays, the Head of the Dragon is con-
fidered of a benevolent nature, and almoft equi-
valent to one of the Fortunes ; and when in afped 5
to the evil planets, is found to abate their malig- n
nant effects in a very eminent degree. But the j
Dragon’s Tail we have always found pf an evil }
tendency; whenever joined with evil planets,
their malevolence is doubled; when joined with
good, their beneficial influence is much abated. j,
PART OF FORTUNE ®. 1,
Next to the Nodes, the Part of Fortune has ,!
Its operations upon the twelve houfes. Thr !
point which we term the Part of Fortune, is the !
dilhnce of the Moon’s place from the Sun, adde(
"
to the degrees of the Afcendant. And the na^
tlirr 1
[ 39 ]
ture of it is, as conftant obfervation afc^rtains,,
that if this point falls among fortunate liars, ,
or
in a fortunate part of the Heavens, then it pro-
ntifes great fuccefs in health or wealth, honour
or offspring, or any other Ipccies of profperity^*
as it is feated in the firfl, eleventh, or fifth houfe^h,
or in any others. The reafon of this appears to
be, that the Sun, Moon, and Afcendant, being
the prime conduits through wjiich the llream 6f
life flows, this feat of the Part of Fortune is
the harmony of all three, concentring and uniting
in the fame acts of benevolence.
Should the Reader be defirous of. more infor-
mation on the planetary fyflem, we- beg leave

mical works of the learned and ingenious Mr.

The ASPECTS of the PLANETS.
THE planets, by their continual motion
through the twelve figns, do make feveral angles,
rays, afpefls, or configurations ; I fhall only fpealc
of thofe which are moft forcible, denoted by the
following characters, before mentioned ; Con-
junction 6 Sextile >|c
,
Quartile , 7'rine a,
Oppofition S .
A ConjunSlion 6 is not properly an afpeCt,
though generally fo called ;
for when two planets
are both in the fame degree and minute of a fign,
they are faid to be in conjunction; confequently
cannot at that time be in afpeCl to each other
:
this is cither good or bad, as the planets are either
friends or enemies to each other.
A Sextile AfpeSi is when two planets are
2 figns, or 6o degrees dillanc, as Jupiter in 15
degrees of Aries, and Saturn in 15 degrees of
Gemini: here Jupiter is in a Sextile afpeCt to
Saturn ; this is an afpeCl of iraperfeCf love or
friendfliip, in any queftion propounded.
A Quartile AfpeSl is when tv/o planets arc
3 figns, or 90 degrees, diftant; as Mars in 10
degrees of Taurus, and Venus in 10 dfgt-es of
E 3 Leo
:
[ 42 ]
Leo: here Mars and Venus are faid to be in
Qiiartile or fquare afpedt, which by profeflbrs is
accounted an afpeil: of imperfect enmity ; the
perfons fignified thereby may have contention,
but may be reconciled again.
A Trine AfpeSl A is when any two planets are
fituated 4 figns, or 120 degrees, diftant j
as Mars
in 12 degrees of Aries, and Sol in 12 degrees of
Leo, are faid to be in Xrine afpe6ts j and this is
an afpedt of perfedl love and friendfhip.
%
'I'he Oppofition § is when two planets are dia-
metrically oppofite, that is, 6 figns, or 180 de--
grees, or one half of the circle, apart; and this is.
an afpeiSt of perfect enmity.
h an afpeft conlifts of fo many de-.|
grees, as we have mentioned ;
yet planets are faidl
to be in afpea when they are not exactly in the:
fame degrees, but within the moiety of their orbs 1*
this is called a Platick A/piif. A Panile AfpeH is3
when two planets are in a Perfea Afpea, in the;
fame degree and minute. It muft be always care-
fully obferved, in thefe Platick Afpea,, whether
the co-operation of the two planets is aoing off'
or coming on with all its force and infTuehcc, as^
that w,ll materially affeft the matter under con-
hderauon.

This Table fliews that each of the planets have
two figns for their houfes, except the Sun and
Moon, which have only one each : thus the houfes
of Saturn, are Capricorn and Aquarius j
of Jupi-
ter, Sagittary and Pifces ;
of Mars, Aries and
Scorpio; of Venus, Taurus and Libra; Mercu-
ry’s houfes are Virgo and Gemini ;
the Sun, Leo ;
the Moon, Cancer. One of each of tbefe houfes
is diftinguiflied by the name of Diurnal or Day-
houfe ;
the other, by Nocturnal or Night-houfe,
which is denoted by the letters D. N. in the table.
In tliefe figns or houfes the planets have their ex-
altations, as pointed out in the third column, viz.
the Sun in 19 degrees of Aries, the Moon in 3
decrees of Taurus; and fo on.
The twelve figns are divided into four Tripli-
cities. The fourth column fhev/s which of the-
planets govern day and night in that Triplicity:
for example; oppofite Aries, Leo, and Sagittary,,
are the Sun and Jupiter; which denotes the Sum
governs by day, and Jupiter by night, in that!
Triplicity: in like manner, Venus rules the earthy
Triplicity by day, and Luna by night; Saturni
rules the airy Triplicity by day, and Mercury by
night; Mars rules the watery, both day and.
night.
In
[ 45 ]
In the fifth, fixth, feventh, and eighth columns,
oppofite Aries, ftand !{. 6, $ 14, &c. which fig-
nify that the firfl: fix degrees of Aries are the
terms of Jupiter ;
from fix degrees to fourteen, are
the terms of Venus; and fo on. In the tenth,
eleventh, and twelfth columns, oppofite Aries we
find $ 10, O 20, ? 30, which fhews that the
firfl: ten degrees of Aries are the phafes of Mars ;
from ten to twenty, the phafes of the Sun ;
from
twenty to thirty, the phafes of Venus. In the
thirteenth column, in a line with Aries, Hands
Venus, in Detriment; which fhews that Venus
being in Aries, is cppofite to one of her own
houfes, and is therefore in detriment. In the four-
teenth column, in the fame line. Hands Saturn,
in fall-, fignifying when Saturn b is in Aries, he is
oppofite to Libra, his houfe of exaltation, and fo
becomes unfortunate, and is hence faid to have
his fall in that fign Aries qr.
The great efFecHs produced by the planets under
thefe fituations, are as follow: If the planet
which is principal fignificator, be pofited in his
own houfe, in any fcheme, figure, or calculation
whatever^ it indicates profperity and fuccefs to
the perfon fignified, or the bufinefs in hand, or
whatever elfe may be the fubjedl of enquiry.
If
[ 4^ I
ir a planet be in his Exaltation, it denotes a-
pcrfon of majeftic carriage, and loftjr difpofition
high-minded, aoftere, and proud.
If a planet be in his Triplicity, the perfon will
be profperous, and fortunate in acquiring pro-
perty ; no matter whether born rich or poor, bis .
circumftances will be promifing and good.
If a planet be in his Terms, it denotes a perfon-^i
to participate rather in the nature and quality of'
the planet; than in the wealth, power, dignity,.,
and honour, indicated thereby.
If a planet be in Its Phafes, and no otherwife*
fortified, though fignificator, it declares the per--
fon or thing fignified to be in great diftrefs, danger,,
and anxiety. And thus in all. cafes judgement is,
to be given, good or bad, according to the firength,,
ability, or imperfections, of the fignificator.
A planet is always eflentially firong, and
operates with greater force, when he is pofited,
as we. have defcribed, in his Houfe, Exaltation,
&c. kc.*

Now it muft be obferved, that the afpecSls ofi
the planets are projeftcd, or raft contrary-ways,,
either forward in a line progreifively with the

In the foregoing Table, at the top of the third
column, note the charafters of the Afpeds,
Sextile Quartile , Trine A, and Oppo-
fition 8 ,
as placed over the figns of the Zodiac t
in the firft, obferve the words Dexter^nd Sinifter,
and in the fecond column, the fign t : thele are
intended to fliew that a planet pofited in Aries,
would fend his Textile Afpeft dexter to Aquarius,
and finifter to Gemini ;
his quartile dexter to
Capricorn, his finifter to Cancer j
his trine dexter
to Sagittary, his finifter to Leo ;
an^vould be in
oppolitipn to a planet pofttcd in eq *1 degrees of
Libra ;
and fo on through the Table. It muft be
obferved, that the dexter Afpedls are more pow-
erful than the finifter.
It will not be improper to fay, as we are now
fpeaking of Afpedls, that to know the true orbs
of the planets, is cil'cntial ;
as planets are feldom
in apartile Afpeft, butufually in a platick Afpe£l:
that is, when they are in the moiety of their orbs%
for example ;
fuppofe T:> be in 15 degrees of T,,
and $ in 10 degrees of u, they are in platick.
Alpefts ;
for the orbs of Saturn k ,
as you may'
perceive by the Table, are 10 degrees, the half
of which is five; the orbs of Venus 2 are eisht:'
take half that, which is four, which added to half
the orbs of Saturn, makes nine degrees ;

Application fignifies the approach of two
planets together, either by conjunction or afpeCt,
and is of three kinds; the firft is when alight
planet, being dlreCl and fwift in motion, applies
to a planet that is more ponderous ;
as Mercury
F 2 ia
[ 52 J
in eight degrees of Aries, and Jupiter in twelve
degrees of Gemini, and both direa; here Mer-
emy applies to a Textile of Jupiter, by dired
application.
Secondly, When they are both retrograde, as.
Mercury in twenty degrees of Arles, and Jupitef
in fifteen degrees of Gemini; here Mercury, the*
lighter planet, applies to the Textile aTped of:'
Jupiter: and this is by retrogradation.
Thirdly, The third kind is occa^oned by one*
planet being dire^f, and the other retrograde : forr
inflancc; fuppoTe Mercury retrograde in lixteeni
dcp-recs, Gemini and Saturn diredf in twelve:
degrees, in tlie Tame Tign ;
here Mercury, being,
tiie lighter planet, applies to a conjundlion of;
Saturn, by a retrograde motion : theTe two laft:
are deemed evil applications. ObTerve, the fu—
perior planets never apply to the inferior, but by
a retrograde motion ; the inlerior planets apply'
both ways.
Prohibitk'n, is when two planets are apply-
ing by body or aTpea, and before they come tc
their nartile alpe^, another planet meets with the
alpeft of the tormei, and lb prohibits the com-'
pletion of the buTineTs. As Mars, in ten degrees]
i 53 ]
of Aries; Venus, in five degrees of Aries; and
Mercury, in five degrees of Aries: here Venus
is applying to a conjun£lion of Mars ; but before
they come to a perfect conjunftion, Mercury,
being fwifter in motion, comes to a conjunftion
with Mars before Venus, and fo prohibits Venus.
Alfo the Sun, being a fvvift planet, -frequently
impedites the other planets, either by body or
afpeft.
r
Stationary, is underftood of a planet, when,
to the eye or fenfes of a beholder here on Earth,
it appears to ftand jftill ;
which they do before
and after retrogradation.
Retrograde, is wheft a planet appears to
move backward, from lO degrees, to 9, 8, 7, See.
and lb, contrary to the fuccelfion of figns, out of
Taurus into Aries ;
and is noted in the Ephemeris
thus,
: Combustion; a planet is faid to be combuft
1
of Sol, when he is within 8 degrees, 30 minutes,
i of his body, either before or after their conjunc-
tion ;
but a planet is more afflifted when apply-
ing to his body, than when he is feparating from
combuftion.
F 3 Cazimi ;
r
L 54 ]
. ,
Cazimi ;
that is, when a planet is fituated in
the heart of the Sun, or only 17 minutes before
or after; a planet in Cazimi is fortified, but a
planet combuft4s of a malignant nature.
Void of Course, is when he is fcparated from
the body or alpecl: of another planet, and doth not
apply to the body or afpecl of another planet
wliilehe remaineth in thatfign; this moft ufually,
happens witli the Moon ; and in pra£lice it is
remarked, that if tlie lignificator of the thing
propounded be void of couri'e, the bufinefs under'
confidcration will not fucceed, nor be attended
with any fatisfa£tory confequenccs.
< BiisiEGiKG, fignifies a planet fituated betwixt
the two evil planets, Saturn and Mars ;
as Saturn i
in 15 degrees. Cancer and Jupiter in 18 degrees,,
and Mars in 20; here Jupiter is befieged of Sa--
turn and ?dars.
Increasing in TjIght, is when a planet iS)
departing from the Sun, or the Sun from a planet..
Sf.ba RATION, IS wnen two planets have been
lately In conjunaion, or afped, and are juft fepa-
Tatcd tioiii it; as Saturn m degrees of l.ibra,,
and.
[ 55 ]
and Mercury In 12 degrees of Libra; here Mer-
cury is j'eparating from a conjundlion with Saturn
;
but they are ftlll in platlck conjunftion fo long as
they remain within their orbs.—The exa£l know-
ledge of the feparation of thcfe afpedls is of the
utmoft confequence in giving judgement upon
various important occafions. For example ; fup-
pofe it were demanded whether a certain treaty of
marriage would take place or not; when all the
afpedls arc colle61ed in the liorofcope or figure,
and the two planets that are fignificators of the
parties are found applying to each other in a con-
junftion, and in common or fixed figns, the mar-
riage may probably take place, in fome length of
time, if the fignificators are pofited in moveable
figns, angular, and approaching fwift in motion
to a conjundfion, it may then be confummated in
a very fhort time ;
but if the fignificators are fe-
I
parated from a conjunflion only a few minutes of
I
a degree, one may fafely conclude that there have
been great probabilities, only a few days before,
jtliat the wedding would have taken place : but by
['this afpe£l the parties appear to be in fufpenfe, or
a diflike has taken place ; and as the fignificators
gradually feparate from the partile and platick
I'conjunftions, in tl^fame gradation will the afFec-
Jtions of the parties alienate and wear away, and
tby the comparative time the afpeft will be before
C 56 J
it entirely leaves, fo will the time be fo many 1
weeks, months, or years, before the parties fhall i
wholly relinquifli the connc<lilion.
j
Frustration, is when a fwift, light planet
j
applies to the body or afpeft of a fuperior planet, I
and before he comes to it, the fuperior planet, or
j
a more ponderous one, meets with the body or {
afpeft of feme other planet; as Jupiter in 15'
degrees of Cancer, Venus in 10 degrees of the-
fame fign, and Mars in 14 degrees of Taurus;,
here Venus applies to a conjunffion of Jupiter ;;
but before they come to a partile conjun»5lion, ,
Mars comes to a fextile of Jupiter, and fo fruf--
trates Venus, and in pradice utterly dellroys.
whatever is promifed by it.
Refranation, is when a planet is applying;
to the body or afpeft of another, and before he;
comes to it he falls retrograde, and fo refrains to)
form the afpc6f expefted, as Saturn in 10 degreess
of T. aurus, and Mars in y degrees of Cancer
here Mars, the fvvifter planet, applies to a fextile.'
of Saturn ; but before he comes to, it falls re-
trograde.
Translation of Light and Virtue, is when
a lighter planet feparates from a weighty one, andi
immediately
[ 57 ]
immediately applies to another fuperior plauet,
and fo tranflates the light and virtue of the firft
planet to that which he applies to, as Saturn in
20 degrees Aries, Jupiter in 13, and Mars in 14,
of the fame hgn : here Mars feparates from a
conjunction with Jupiter, and tranflates the light
and virtue of that planet to Saturn, to whom he
next applies. The cfFeCt of this in praCfice will
be, that if a matter or thing be promifed by Sa-
turn, then whoever was reprefented by Mars fhall
procure all the affiftance that the good planet
Jupiter could beftow, and tranflate it to Saturn,
whereby the bulinefs in hand would be the better
effeCled, and more happily concluded ;
and this
being a very fortunate pofition of the planets,
is very proper to be known, lince it promifes
much in law-fuit', marriages, and all other quef-
tions of the kind.
Reception, is when two planets that arefig-
nificators in any queftion, ai e in each other’s dig-
nities, either by houfe, exaltation, triplicity, or
term, as Sol in Cancer, and Luna in Leo ; here
thev are in reception by houfe, or Sol in Taurus,
and Luna in Aries ;
this is Reception by exalta-
tion, &c. In praClice the ufe of this is con-
fiderable : if the event is denied by the afpeffs,
the thing delired will fltortly come to pafs by
reception, to the fatisfaCIion of all concerned.

Longitude and Latitude ; the Longitude'
of any planet or ftar is the degree of the Ecliptic:

Right Ascension, is the number of the de-
grees and nxinutes of the Equinoftial Line,
reckoned from Aries, and comes to the Meridian
with the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Planets, or any
portion of the Ecliptic.
Oblique Ascension, is the degrees and mi-
nutes of the Equinoctial Line that come to, or
rife with the degree of longitude of any liar or

or it is the degree of the
Equinoctial that comes to the Horizon with any
Iftar or planet in an oblique fphere.

Horoscope, IS a figure or fcheme of the Twelve

Explanation of the Twelve Houfes of Heaven, and
Jjirological Signification of them.
That the Reader may form a competent idea of
what is meant by the Twelve Houles of Heaven,,
let us fuppofe the whole celcftial globe or fphere
of Heaven divided into four equal parts, bv the
horizon and meridional line ;
and each of thefc
into four quadrants, and each quadrant into three
equal parts, by lines draw'n from points of
feftlons
r 6i ]
fedtions in different parts of the horizon and
meridian, equi-diftant from each other; by this
operation the whole globe or fphere will be appor-
tioned into twelve equal parts, which conftitute
what we call the Twelve Houfes of Heaven:
and thefe Houfes, obfervation and experience
abundantly Oiow, make up that great Wheel of
Nature, whereon depend the various fortunes con-
tingent to all fublunary matters and things.

The lines thus drawn, defcribe the above figure
or horofcope, into which the figns and planets are
feverally introduced and reprefented as in their
true places in the Heavens, before any queftion
can be folved, or nativity calculated. The fpace
in the centre, were the figure drawn circular,
might reprefent the vacuum wherein the Earth
moves; but it generally is ufed to write dov/n
the day, year, and hour of the day, when the'
figure was ere(Sled, and the purpofe of it.
Thefe Twelve Houfes are each diftinguifhed by
their refpe^live figures, and are either Angular,,
Succedent, or Cadent. The Angular houfes are?
four, called the Afcendant, Mid-Heaven, or'
Medium Coeli, the feventh houfe and the bottomi
of heaven; thefe are deemed the moft powerful:
and moft fortunate houfes: the Succedent houfes,,
eleventh, fecond, eighth, and fifth, are ranked!
next in force and virtue to the angles : the Cadent'
o
houfes are the third, twelfth, ninth, and fixth,
and are confidered of the leaft efficacy of them ah..
We (hall now explain their properties in that'
fyftem of nature upon which the do£lrine of
horary queftions is grounded ; and fuch has beerr
the induftry and indefatigable labour of our fore-J
fathers in bringing this fcience to perfedfion, anti
in difcoYcring and diftinguifhing the particular'
fignificationi
r 63 ]
fiiiiiifications and efFedls of all pofitions of the
planets in thefe Twelve Houfes of Heaven, that
whoever takes the pains to inform himfelf fuffi-
ciently of them, will not be in want of compe-
tent grounds whereon to judge and give rational
anfwers to every queftiot) on tne common occur-
rences of life, or any undertaking, with the con-
fequences and fuccefs of them.
The FIRST House bears fignification of the life
of man ;
ftature, complexion, form, and fhape of
him who propounds a quellion ; in ftiort, all
queftions relating to health, long life, travelling
by land or fea, whether attended with fafety and
fuccefs. Thefe, and a number of other circum-
ftances that affect life, are to be anfwered from
the firft houfe. Of colours, the firfi: houfe gives
a white; that is, if a planet be pofited in this
houfe, that governs a light colour, and a queftion
be propounded from any party relative to a perfon,
matter, or thing, where colours are concerned,
and this planet be fignificator thereof, then the
j
perfon’s complexion and drefs, or if cattle, then
their colour, fhaJl be of a white, pale, or lightifii
kind. Though this may appear abfurd to fome
of our readers, the fa£l ftands unfhaken in prac-
tice. Now, as every one of the twelve houfes
have their fignificators, fo have they alfo their
G 3 con*
[ 64 ]
conJi^TilJicotoTs^ which have frecjueiit operatiorij
and oupht to be confidered. A confignificator
is a planet, either fallen into conjiin£lion, or
joined in afpecl with the principal figniflcator :
in which cafes, the planet either affifts or oppofes
in the matter under confideration. If it be joined
with a benevolent planet, it imports good j
if an
evil one, it denotes deftrudion, or great difturbance
to the fubiefl of enquiry in the completion of it.
The confignificators of this Houfe are Saturn
and Aries.
The SECOND House relates to wealth or po--
verty, profperity or adverfity, lofs or gain, in any
undertaking that may be propounded by the quo-*
rent j* and alfo concerning moveable goods, money
lent, or employed in fpeculation. In fuits of
law or equity it fhews a man’s friends. It gives ai
green colour; and the fame remark holds good in'
all other Houfes, as mentioned in the firft Houfe..
The confignificators of this fecond Houfe are.
Jupiter and Taurus.
The THIRD House gives judgement upon
all queftions relative to brethren, fifiers, kindred,,
and neighbours; and of all inland journies; and
of reniov’ng one s manufaiffory or buiinels from
one place to arothcr, ^c. Its ccnfignihcators
are
C 65 J
are Mars and Gemini ; Mars is, of courfe, not fo
evil In this Houfe as in the other: it gives a yel-
low, red, or forrel colour.
From the fourth House we refolve all ques-
tions in any way relating to the father of the
querent; alfo all enquiries concerning land,
houfes, or eftates; or to towns, cities, caftles, or
intrenchments befieged, or treafures hidden in the
ground ;
and all other things relating to the Earth
are anfwered out of this houfe, which is called
Imurn Cceli, or Angle of the Earth. Its conligni-
7 0 O
ficators are the Sun and Cancer: it governs the
red colour.
By the fifth House we form all our predic--
tions relative to children and to pregnant women;
alfo all queftions concerning the prefent health of
abfent Tons or daughters, or the future health of •
ihofe at home; enquiries relating to the veal and
perfonal effedfs of one’s father,- or concerning the
fuccefs of mefl'engers, ambafladors, or refpedting
the ammunition or flrength of a place befieged,
arc all anfwered from this houle. Its confignifi-
cators are Venus and Leo: it indicates a mixed,
i
black and white, or honey colour.
The SIXTH Hoose refolves all queftions that
in any refpedl appertain to fervants, cattle, pr the
G 3 ftdte:
[ to ]
ftate of Tick perfons, v/hether curable or nof, the
nature of the tiifeafe, and wliether of fliort or long
duration; particulars relating to uncles or aunts,
and all kindred on the father’s fide ;
al fo concern-
ing one’s ftev/ards, tenantc. Sic. its configir.fi-
carors are Mercury and Virgo; it is in no afpe<5t
to the Afcendant, and is always deemed an unfor-
tunate houfe ; it gives a black or dark colour.
By the SEVFNTH Mouse we are enabled to re-
folve all queftions on love affairs and marriage,
and to dcfcribe the perfon of either man or woman
that the querent wl:l be joined with in marriage;
it likewile anfwers all enquiries of the defendant
in law-fuits or litigations, or concerning our pub-
lic enemies in rime of war; in thefts, it enables
us t.) deferihe the perfon of the robber, by his
fjiape, fiature, complexion, and condition of life;
and it dilcovers fugitives, outlawed men, and of->
fenders cfcaped from juftlce ; it alfo fignifies grand-
* fathers. The coniignificators to this houle are the*
Moon and Libra : it gives a dark blue, brown, or
black colour.
From the eighth House we lolve all queilions'
concerning death, its time, quality, and 'nature,,
with all matters relating to legacies,\vills, and lafL
teft aments, or who (hall inherit the fortunes orr
cfttiiCs of the deceafed, inquiries on the portiem
C 67 ]
of maids and widows, in law-fuits relative to the
defendant’s fuccefs and frientfs, and queftions on
public or private enemies, or concerning the fub-
ftance and fecuiity of thole we connedl ourftlves
with in bufinefs, are all anfwercd by the fituation
of the planets in this houfe. Its confignificators
are Saturn and Scorpio j
colour, green and black.
By the ninth Mouse we are enabled to refolve
all queftions on the fafety and futcefs ®f voyages
and tfavels into foreign countries, concerning the
clergy, benefices, preferments, advowfons, &c,
and all quefiions relative to kindred, on the w'ife’s*
fide, or hulband’s if the wife is the querent, and
all matters relating to arts and fciences, books, &c,
Jupiter and Sagittarius are confignificators; it
rules green and white.
The TENTH House, being the Medium Cceliy
or mold elevated part of the whole Heavens, re-
folves all queftions concerning kings, noblemen,
judges, magiftrates, and all other perfons in power
and authority ;
it fignifies the querent’s mother,
and hath fignification of honour and preferment,
if attainable or not. The confignificators are
Capricorn and Mars ; its colours are red and white.
By the eleventh FIouse we anfwer all en-
quiries relative to friends, hope, truft^ expectance,
or
[ 68 ]
or defire; alfo whatever relates to the perfidy of
friends. The confignificators of this houfe are
the Sun and Aquarius ;
its colour, falFron or deep
yellow.
The TWELFTH House, being the Houfe of
Tribulation, refolves all queftiuiis of forrow, af-
fliction, anxiety of mind, trouble, diftrefs, and
iinprifonment, perfecution, malice, fecret enemies,
fuicide, trcafon, aflaffination, and all misfortunes
of ‘mankind ;
and relations on the mother’s fide.
Its confignificators are Venus and Pifces ;

The

The ufe of the Ephemerls in fctting a figure,
is to point out the places of the planets at noon,
whenever required ;
as we lliall explain fully.
The 12 Tables of Houfes are next to be referred
to ;
and tliefe are calculated to drew what degrees
of each Sign polTefs the Cufps or Lines of the I2
Houfes of Heaven. When the figure is ere£fed,
they begin in Partridge’s Almanack with the Sun’s
entrance into the fign Aries, and fliew his progrefs
through each degree of the 1 2 figns of the Zodiac.
Now, for example, fuppofe it were required to
ercifl a iiguve for Saturday the 20th day of Auguft,
1785, at.ioh. 16 min. A.M. that is, 16 minutes
pafl 10 o’clock in the morning; To begin to do
this, I refer to the aforefaid almanack for the month
of Auguft, on the left-hand page^; and oppofite
the 20th day of the month, in the firft wide co-
lumn, with the charaffers Q. Si- printed at the
top, I find 27 . 45. Looking up again, I fee the
fign SI or Leo printed facing Lammas-day, and
9 ^ which fignifies that the Sun © was in
9 Leo, at 12 o’clock the ift day
of Auguft ;
but on the 20th of Auguft I perceive
he is, as aforefaid, in 27 deg. 45 min. in Leo,
which indicates that at 12 o’clock on the 20th of
Auguft he is in 27 deg. 45 min. of Leo exa£lly.
The minutes we rcjedl when lefs than j

tvhen more, add as many as will make it even :
15 added makes it 28 degrees. I then turn to
page 36* ; I fee © in or Sol in Leo ;
and in
the nrft wide column I fee at the top, time from
noon, next fmall column, 10, ii, 12; i, 2, 3;
and then a double line to divide the other Table
from 0 in tijj, or Sol in Virgo, which is juft the
fame ; fo that there are two Tables of Houfes on
one fide of the almanack. In the 2d column, under
^ I find even with 28 degrees lO ; i, that is, 10
a o j 5
hours, I minute; which are always to be added
to the exaft time or hour of the day when the
figure is ercfted, unlefs it be exailly at noon ;
in
that cafe, the Sun, Moon, planets, and figns, are
to be fet down precifely as they are found in the
Ephemeris and Tables of Houfes. The Reader,
by eredling a few figures, and praftifing a fe\v
hours, will foon find it come familiar to him. But
if it be erefled before noon or after noon, (except
adding half a degree an hour to the Moon’s place
if afternoon, or deducing half a degree an hour
if in the forenoon,) tlie reft of the planets may
be fet down as found in tire Ephemeris, without
making any material difference in horary queftionsa

I feek thi-s remainder in the Table of Houfes en-
titled O in Sit or Sun in Leo: in the column,
time from noon, I find 8.17*; next little column
I fee 2 degrees of SI, which are oppofite 8.17,
which is denoted by loth Houfe, SI top of the
column ;
and therefore I place 2 degrees of Leo
on the line or Cufp of the loth Houfe of the
figure. This done, I refer to the next column in
rotation on the left hand, and in the fame line
with the 2 degrees of Leo 1 find 6, and looking
to the top of the column find it to be 6 degrees of
j
the fign WR, with iith Houfe over it; and there-
fore 1 place 6 degrees of Virgo upon the Cufp of
the nth Houfe. I follow the fame rule with the
next column, where I find 3 in the 3d line ;
at
the top I fee 12 rO: ;
and accordingly place 3 de-
I
grees of Libra on the Cufp of the 12th Houfe,
;
Then I refer to the next column, where I find
j
24 . 3, and at the top the word Afccn. with the
fign prefixed, which fignifies that 24 deg. 3 m.
, occupy the ift Houfe or Afcendant, w'hich I place
'
accordingly, leaving out the 3 minutes, v/hich
'
are immaterial. I then refer to the next column ;
and even with the preceding figures Hands 21 ;
when looking up the column, I obferve the fign ni,
and 2 at the top, w'hich fhews that 2 1 degrees of
Scorpio are to be placed on the Cufp of the 2d
Houfe. This being done, I refer to the laft co-
•
, K luma;
Or th« ««areft »5nuto8 to it, if not «cad.
[ 98 ]
lumn ;
and even with the former numbers 1 find
24; and looking a little higher, as before, I ob--
ferve the fign , and 3 over it; which plainly
indicates 24 degrees of Sagittary are to be placedl
on the line or Cufp of the 3d Houfe. Thus the;
fix oriental Houfes, namely, loth, nth, 12th,,
ift, 2d, 3d, are furnifhed with the degrees of eachi
fign then rifing upon them; and the other ffx, or-
occidental Houfes, being oppofite to the former,,
are always furnifhed with the fame degrees of the*
'
oppofite figns ; thus; •

So that the loth Houfe is oppofite to the 4th. i"
«nd the 4th to the 10th; the nth to the 5th: t
a^d the 5th to the nth; and fo through th(
whole
[ 59 ]
whole : the ufc of which is, that if on the Cufp
of the lOth Houfe you find the fign Aries, then
on the Cufp of the 4th you mufi: place the fign
Libra; and whatever degree of Aries pofl'effes the
Cufp of the loth Houfe, the fame degree mufi: be
placed on the 4th. For example: In the prefent
figure we have placed 2 degrees of SI on the Cufp
of the loth Houfe ;
nov/ being oppofite to Leo,
and the 4th Houfe to the loth, we therefore place
2 degrees of on the Cufp of the 4th Houfe
:
upon the Cufp of the nth nji is already placed;
and the 5th Houfe being oppofite to the I ith, and
uji oppofite to K , I place 6 degrees of X on the
Cufp of the 5th Hpufe : the Cufp of the 6th Houfe
being vacant, I place.
3 degrees of fy, the 6th be-
ing facing the 12th, upon the Cufp of the- id
Houfe orAfcendant. There are 24degrees of Libra
;
and the yth Houfe being oppofite to the ift, and
the fign =2: to T, I therefore again place on the
Cufp of the 1 2th Hoiife, with 24 degrees on the
line of it; fo that there is ty on the Cufp of the
5th and 6th Houfes, which denotes that there is a
fign intercepted, which I place in the 3d and 9th
Houfes, viz. 25 and Pf. Upon the Cufp of the
8th Houfe I place 21 deg. b j
becaufe the 8th is
oppofite to the 2d 1 then refer to the 3d Houfe,
which is : oppofite to the 9th n 24, I place
24 degrees upon the Cufp of the 9th Houfe; and
K 2 thus
[ 100 ]
thus the 12 Houfes are completely furnlflied with
the 12 Signs of the Zodiac, and the degrees afcend-
ing at the precife time of ereding the figure.
Xhis rule mull ever he obferved ftriclly, as it is
univerfal, and always holds true.
Having To far fucceeded, the next thing is to
place the Sun, Moon, and Planets, in the figure,
according to their pofition at that time in the
Heavens; and this is alfo to be done by the help
of the left-hand page of Partridge’s Ephemeris,
which may be had in Pater-nofter-Row, or at Sta-
tioners-Hall, printed for the Company of Sta-
tioners. For inftance, I again turn to the 20th of
Augufi;*, and oppofite to it, in thefirft column, isi
27 . 45, which fhews that the Sun is 27 deg, 45;
min. of Leo, marked at top O Sb ;
but as the:
minutes are more than 30, 1 make them up 6o,,j
which make him in 28 degrees of Leo that day at:
noon nearly ; which fign is upon the Cufp of the:
10th Houfe : I place the Sun in that Houfe, clofe;
to the fign, v/ith the degrees. I then refer to the.
Ephemeris for the Moon’s place, and in the 2di
column I find her in the fame line, in o deg, ijj
min. of K, at noon : I therefore dedudb i degreef,,
being near 2 hours, before noon ;
and then her place.'

is in the fign in 27 deg. which I enter ir]i
the 4th Houfe, near to the lign I then refer to
the Ephemeris for the planet S , which I find in the
3d column, even with the 20th day of the month,
— printed at the top of the column. I find him
in 25 deg. of « ,
which I place in the 8th Houfe,
over « • I then turn to the Ephemeris for Venus
and Mercury, which l»find in the"" 4th and 5th
column, even with the other line 12 Si 22 ; which
figniFy that V’^enus is in 12 deg. of Cancer, the
fign £5 being facing the 7th day of the month in the
4th column, and alfo the fign even with the 4th
day of the month under ? & ^ ,
printed at top, with
n & in the 5th column. As foon zs u Sc SI
end. So Sc JiJl begin their degrees as far as 30,
which is one Houfe or Sign. So they proceed
through tl'ic 12 Houfes, making 360 degree?,
moving from t to b' 5
except when retrograde,
the Sun only moving from v to K. Next I refer
to the top of the Ephemeris, on the left hand
;
on the right-h^ind corner I fee four colu,mns ; ife
printed at the top JVi.D. or days of the month;
2d column T? ^ j
3d column if , & t under him ;
next D £3 under the Moon ; which indicate, th^t
on the ift, Gth, nth, i6th, 21ft, and 26th days
of the month, thofe Planets, moving flow, are i.ji
1 thofe degrees in thofe figns marked at the top :
'
, 3 therefore
[ 102
] j
therefore I take the neareft day to the 20th of
|
Auguft, which is the 2iftj when I find b in no
degree of or exadtly on the entrance of that
fign ; % in 14 'r ;
Dragon’s Head Q or Moon’s
Node in 1 1 of Aquarius ;
therefore I enter the
reft in their proper places in the foregoing figure,
viz. Venus in 12 deg. 25, which is not upon the
Cufp of any Houfe, but intercepted between the
9th and loth Houfes ; therefore I place her in the
9th Houfe, clofc to 2S, Mercury in 22 deg. of ^K,
b in no deg. of i; in 14 deg. S in ii
deg. XT, and Dragon’s-tail being always op-
pofite to Q, in the fame degree, in the oppofite fign,
the 4th being oppofite to the loth.
The figure is now entirely completed, except
putting in the Part of Fortune, which I fliall in-
fert plainly, fo as to be intelligible to any ordinary
capacity. As the Part of Portune is of the ut-
moft confequence where property is concerned,,
therefore we fliall be the more particular, efpeci-
ally as there is no book extant but what is ambi-
guous on this head*. The Part of Fortune 0 is.
taken either by day or night, by fubtradling the*
place of the Sun from the place of the Moon ini
figns and degrees, remembering to add 12 figns tO)
the Moon s place if lubtra£lion cannot be made:
without,,
Nor any modern Bosk of this Science but what Is exceedingly/
•«0D«0U$ JU tbtit TabUs, which ought to be the moft ascuratc.
[ 103 ]
witho«^, and to the remainder add the fign and?
degree of the Afcendant ;
which will give tho
exacfi place of the Part of Fortune 0.
For example: fuppofe we are required
to find the Part of Fortune for the fol-
lowing figure, eredled for Aug. 20, 1785 :
I fip-d the place of Luna 5 to be in A-
quarius 28 deg. which you muft reckon
as in the margin, counting from begin-
ning of Aries to the beginning of b one
v/hole fign, &c. The Moon’s longitude
is loTigns, 28 deg. the place of Sol is
in Leo SI 28 deg. which is 4 figns, zS
deg. as for example :
'
Sijns. Deg.
The longitude of the Moon is 10 . 28
Subtrai^ the longitude of the Sun 4 . 28
Remains 6 . o
Then add the fign and degree j
on the Afcendant j
’
. The total is — 12.. . 24
If it had exceeded- 12, you muft have fubtrafte'd
12, and the remainder would then have been the
place of the Part of 0. In queftions of impor-
taxrce, you may take notice of the minutes and
fcconds, wl^ioh are in White’s Ephemeris :

[ 104 ]
So that you may clearly perceive, that the Part
of Fortune falls in 24 deg- of Aries ;
I therefore
enter it before the Cufp of the 7th Houfe. [Ob-
ferve this proof, That fo far as Sol is diftant from
Luna, fo far is the Part of Tcriune diftant frona
the Afcendant; fo that if you take it upon a new
Moon, the Part of Fortune is in the Afcendant
upon the firft quarter in the 4th Houfe, upon a
full Moon in the 7th Houfe, upon the laft quarter
in the icth Houfe.]

This figure includes all that is required for the
purpofe of judging horary queftions ; and thus^
by proper attention and diligence,, may any perfon
of ordinary talents eredl the Horolcope, and in-
troduce the planets. This is a very great ad-
vancement irh thTs fcience, undoubtedly ; but
without the Reader has the ability to define from
the afpetSls, &c. of the planets*, it will not be of
any real utility to him.
Proceed we next to the ultimatum of this work,.
PAHT THE SECOND.
Of the Art tf refolving Horary ^.lejllons,
All enquiries that are ferious, and of fonie
importance, that come under the name of Horary
Qiieftions, muft neceiTarily relate either to things
paji-t prefent, or to co?ne^ or to concerns that once
were^ 7iow are^ or may be hereafter ;
and the anfwer
to fuch qucftions muft bt: either cffcntial or acci^
dental: The efiential anfwer is always one of the
three following, concerning which the enquiry is
made; ift, Ti or not to be? 2dly, either good

means many pretenders to Aftrology fail fliamefully
'in their undertakings. To avoid which, let the
following Qiteries be attended to.
The confideration of the matter propofed is
taken from that houfe which has relation to and
Signification of the fame; and this fignification is
either fmple or compound. Thefimple fignification
of the houfes is that which hath relation fingly to
the perfon of the querent. Compound fignification
is that which hath relation to the matter, or que-
fited. The ^icrent is he or fhe that afks the
•queftion. The matter, or quefited, is that about
which the queftion is propofed. The fimple fio--
tiification of the houfes is as follows The ift
houfe fignifies the querent’s life and perfon; the
2d houfe his fubftance ; the 3d his kindred, neigh-
•bours, and fhort journies ; the 4th his grave, fa-
ther, and lands; the 5th his plcafures and ofF-
fpring; the 6th his ficknefs, Servants, and fmall
cattle ;
the 7th his wife, public enemies, and law-
fuits; the 8th his death and legacies; the 9th his
religion, long voyages, and learning; the loth
his mother, trade, and honour; the l ith his friends
•and hopes; the 12th bis private enemies, great
cattle, imprifonment, and croiTes. The compound
fignification is derived from the fmple^ by con—
fidering what houfe, that is, which fimiifies the
I

matter or quefited, and accounting that, be It
whatfoever it may, the ift houfe or Afcendant;
and fo afcribing the ilgnlficatlon of the ift hoiilb
of the figure to It ;
doing in like manner to all '
the other houfes in order : fo that, if a queftion
relate to a brother or relation, the ^d houfe is then I
his Afcendant or ill houfe, and fignifies his rifc:j
and perfon ;
the 4th houfe (which in this cafe is.
his 2d) his fubllance or eflate ; the 5th houfe hisij
3d, his relations and fhort journies ; the 6th his.
4th houfe, his father; the 7th, his children; the-
8th, his ficknefs ; the 9th, his wife, &c. and thc:j
fame of all others. Thefe things being laid as ai|
foundation, we come now to fhew the perfe£lioni
of the matter by the different affedlions of the*
Afpefts.
^^ERY I. Js the fubjeSt of enquiry Xo be qv'
Not to be ?
The firft thing to be attended to, is the deftruc-
tion orperfeftion of every matter under confidera—
tion. The completion or perfeaion of the fubjeft'
of enquiry may be affefted feveral ways, viz. by
the application^ iranjlation^ reception^ and pejition^.
of the planets; and thclc are determined by the
refpeaive fignificators of the fubjea of enquiry;;
which aie, ill, the Lords of thole Houfes w'hich
rclatci
[ 1C9 ]
relate to the matter In hand ; adly, planets near
the culps of thofe houfes ;
3dly, planets exalted
or dignified therein ;
and, 4thly, the confignifi-
cators of thofe houfes ;
which we have deferibed
before, in the fignificators of the Twelve Houfes.
'I'he Lords of the Houfes are thofe planets which
are Lords of the figns that happen to fall on the
cufps of the houfes, as fhewn before, and may be
feen in the Table of the Planets Houfes. From
hence it appears, that each houfe has a primary
and fecondary confignificator ;
the firft whereof
arifes from the order of the planets, the other
'from the order of the figns; as the ill houfe or
afeendant, Saturn and Mars; that is, Saturn and
Aries; and fo on, &c.
'
The Afeendant, his Lord, and the Moon, arc
to fignify the querent ;
and that houfe and his
lord to which ihe queftion belongs, to fignify the
quefired : then confider what application is be-
tween the ftgnijicators
:
if they apply to a con-
junflion, in angles, fwift in motion in any of
their cflential dignities, it fhews the matter en-
quired after will be brought to perfedion fpeedily ;
if in fuccedent houfes, not fo foon ;
if in cadent
houfes, with much lofs of time.
When the fignificators apply by fextile or trine,
from good houfes, and they in any of their efi'en-
L tial
[
no j
tial dignities, and free from the evil rays of thes
Infortunes, it is an argument the matter will fooni
be completed. If the lignificators apply by ai
quartile afpeft, in good houfes, and they be ini
their eflential dignities, it fhews the thingenquired
after will be brought to perfeftion, although not.
lb feafily, nor io fuccefsfully. Things arc brought
to perfebtion fometimes when the lignificators arc
in oppefttion^ but this happens when the figmfica-
tors are in mutual reception by houfes ;
but if it is
completed, it is with much trouble and anxiety,
and the querent will be forry he fought after it.
Matters are brought to perfeSlion by iravjlation of
light and virtue, when the lignificators do not be-
hold each other, but fome lighter planet feparateth
himfelf from the one fignificator which he was in
mutual reception with, and then applies to the other
fignificator before he comes to the body or afpe£t
of another planet ;
and you may judge the thing
enquired after will be brought to perfe£lion by
fuch a planet as that planet fignifies which thus
tranllates the light and virtue of one fignificator
to the other.
The fubjeft of enquiry may be brought to per-
fection by pofition ;
that is, when the fignificator
of the thing is pofited in tlrc Afcendant, or if the
I.ord of the Afcendant be pofited in the houfe of
the quefited ; but this fingle tellimony fcldom per-
fects
[ 111 ]
fefts the bufinefs, without feme of the aforefaid
arguments happen, or the two figniiicators caft
their leveral alpefts to feme more weighty planet
than themfelves, whom they are both in recep-
tion with, and then the perfon fignified by that
planet who colkas boih their lights may bring '
it to perfeaion.
Quer-Y 2. Whaf/hall le the deJlrnSlion cr hituli wtce
of a matter enquired after ?
The thing enquired after is deftroyed by Pro^
hibition, Fruftration, Refranation, Afped, Sepa-
ration, Tranflation, and Combnflion ;
for which
pleafe to refer to the Technical terms ufecl in Ai-
trology, where a full definition is given of them.
Any of thefe are fufiicient to deftroy the matter,
more efpecially if fome or all of thele fignificators
happen to be in fixed figns, and in a cadent or
fuccedent houfe.
For inflance ;
when you find the {igni^?ators
applying to conjunflion or alpeiSf, and before
they come to their partile afpedf fome other planet
comes to the conjunftion or afpe£t of one of the
fignificators, and that planet hinders the thing
from being brought to perfeftion ;
confider the
nature of that planet ;
allb what houfe he is lord
of ; from hence you may know what perfon will
L 2 be
[ 112 ]
be the hiiidrancc. If it be the Lord of the third,
it flicws feme neighbour, brother, &c. if it be
the Lord of the 4th, the querent’i father, 8cc. will
be the hindrance, or iinpediting planet. Alfo,
when the fignlfrcators apply by body or afpeft,
and before they come to their partile afpeft one
of the lignificators falls retrograde, and fo pre-
vents the completion of the thing enquired after,
if the Lord of the Afcendant falls retrograde,
the querent will hardly proceed any further.
. Combuftlon, or the conjunffion of the Sun, is
the greateft affliftion of all. Separation is when
the lignificators of the querent have lately been in
afpedl, and are newly or juft feparated, though
never fo little ;
and this denotes the full and entire
deftruftion of the matter ; which we feldom or
ever find to fail.
Query 3. Is the ^natter good or evil ?
Confider the houfe to which the thin? belonos,
its Lord, and planets therein; and the houfe iig-
nifyingthematter of the end, its Lord, and planets
therein ;
and if the houfe fignifying the thing be
tortihed by the prefence or beams of good planets,
or if the Dragon’s-head be there, it fliews good ;
but the contrary, evil.
Query
r ]
Query 4. Is the report true or falfe ?
If any planet be in the houfe fignifying the
matter concerning which the report is, or the
Dragon’s-head be there, or the Lord of the fame
houfe be angular, or in conjundlion or afpeil of
any planet, the matter or report is true : but if the
report was good, and the faid figniflcator or planet
pofited in the faid houfe be retrograde, flow, com-
buft, or peregrine, or in evil afpc£l of a more
weighty planet, or cadent, or in conjundtion with
!
theDragon’s-tail, or theDragon’s-tai) pofited in the
I
faid houfe, it certainly fignifies the report is falfe ;
and fo contrary wife. The Moon angular generally
fignifies the report to be true, if the report be
evil, efpecially if (he be in evil afpedl ;
or if good,
if file be in good afpedl: of the benevolent. The
Moon in a fixed fign, and in conjunftion with the
Dragon’s-head, fhews truth ;
but moveable, void, ,
of courfe, and in conjun61:ion of the Dragon’s- tail,
falfehood. Hitherto of the eflential anfwer.of a
queftion.j we now come to the accidental.
Qijery 5. Where ox which zvay ?.
Wherever the fignificator is, there is the thing.
The houfe where he is pofited (hews the quarter
of Heaven, or point.of the compafs, which way
the thing may be. If the houfe and fign agree,
this judgement is the more firm if they difagree,
L 3 confider
A
C ”4 J
confider the pofition of the Moon, and with what |
fhc agrees moft, and give judgement from her.
If the Moon agrees neither with the fign nor i
houfe in which the fignificator is pofited, then ^
confider the Part of Fortune in the fame manner |
as you confidered the Moon, and judge accord- |
ingly. If this anfwcr not, confider the Difpofer j
of the Part of Fortune. I
The diftance is difeovered from the proximity
of the fignificators to body or afpedf, confidered
as they may happen to be either angular^ fucceder.ty I
or cadent \
refpeCl being had to their iaiitudc,
whether little or great, North or South. Great
latitude fhews obfeurity and great difficulty in I
finding what is fought for; if North latitude,
difficulty only, not impoffibility; but if South,
then all the labour c.f fecking is in vain, unlefs the
fignificators be angular, and near in afped. Angles
|
fignify nearneis ; farther off; cadents^
beyond all imagination. The fignificator
and without latitude, fhews fome paces ; if North
latitude, fome furlongs ; if South, fome miles di-
fiant. The fignificator yzra^r/tw/, and without lati-
tude, fhews fome furlongs ; if it hath North lati-
tude, fome miles ; if South, fome leagues. If
sadent^ and without latitude, fhews fome miles j
North latitude, fome leagues; South, fome de-
\
grees.
[ II5 3
grees. Thefe rules are to be confidered chiefly in
things that have life. If it be required to know
the true number of paces, furlongs, miles, leagues,
or degrees diftance, confider the number of degrees
and minutes between the body or afpe6l of the
fignificator ;
and according to the number of de-
grees which are between the conjundion, fextile,
quartile, trine, or oppolition, fo many paces, fur-
longs, miles, leagues, or degrees, is the thing
fought after diftant from the place from whence
it was loft, or from the perfon making enquiry
;
and fo many minutes as adhere to the degrees, fo
many both parts of the fame denomination of the
meafurc which one degree fignifieth is to be ac-
counted and added to the former number.
Query 6. When or in tvhat time ?
The limitation of time is taken either by houfe
or fign, or by afpebl. If the fignificator hath la-
titude, the meafure of time hath its limitation
from houfe and fign. Whether things are to be
brought to pafs or deftroyed, the time, if it be
fignified by houfe and fign, muft be confidered,
as the fignificator is angular, fuccedent, or cadent
having moveable, Jixed^ or common figns. Angles
ftgnify fuddenly j
fuccedents, long time, and with
much difficulty ;
cadents, fcarcely at all, or with
vexation. Angles fignify, if they have moveable
I
[ ]
figns, fome days ;
if common figns, fome weeks
and if fixed figns, fome months. Succedent fig-
nify, if moveable, fome months ;
common figns,
fome years ;
and if fixed figns, when all hopes are '
pafi, if at all. If you defire to know the number
of days, weeks, months, or years, ccnfider the
degrees and minutes between the body or afpetfl of
the fignificator j
and according to the number of
decrees which are between their conjundlion, fex-
tile, quartile, trine, oroppofitien, fo many days,
weeks, months, or years, fhall it be before the
matter is accompliflied or deftroyed. Great S. la-
titude often prolongs the time; N. latitude often
cuts it off fhorter ;
but if the fignificators have
no latitude, the exaft time is made fimply by the
afpedls. The time fignificators meet is found out.
in the Ephemeris.
Query 7. Hoio or why ?
The planets which make the prohibition or
fruftration are the hurting, impediting planets j.
that is, the planets that fignify him or her, or that
thing, which fhall hinder the bufinefs ; which we
have created of before : and obferve, laftly, that
whatfoever has been faid of the impediting or
hindering planet, the fame holds good of the ad-
juvant or helping planet*

General Rules to know if a ^cjllon is radieal^ orJit
to be judged.
Before you give judgement upon your figure,
you ought to confider whether the figure eredted
is radical or fit for judgement, left the querent
come purpofely to abufe you ; for the difeovery of
which the ancients have left us .the following
Rules :
ift. If you find the Lord of the Houfe and
Lord of the Afcendant of one and the fame Tri-
plicity, or when the Lord of the hour and the
lign afeending fliall be of one triplicity, thequef-
tion is then radical, and fit to be judged.
If the fign afeending and the planet in the
afcendant deferibe the perfon of the querent, the
queftion is radical, and fit to be judged; but if
either the very beginning or extreme end only of
a fign afeend, it will not be proper to give judge-
ment ;
it denotes the queftion has been propofed
merely out of ridicule. This rule I have often
verified in practice. The fame thing is indicated
by the quartile or oppofition of the Aloon with
the Lord of the yth, or by the Moon being void
of courfe, or combuft ; which pofition denotes
the queftion improperly ftated. Saturn In the
Afcendant,
[ uS ]
Afcendant, impedited or affll(5led, fliews the que-
ftion propofed either falfc, or the fu bjecl part hope;
and whenever the Lord of the Afcendant is com-
buft, or retrograde, it implies the fame tiling.
The Artill muft always judge by the greater tefti-
monies ;
but if the fignificators are found equally
ffrong for and againft the matter, it is better to
defer judgement to a future time.
It is an aftonilhing faft, that moles^ or marhs^
are all diflinguiiOied by the figns and planets which
prevail at the time of birth, notwithftanding all
endeavours to refute the idea of planetary influence.
This truth is annually recorded in every almanack.
Obferve what fign is upon the Cufp of the
Afcendant, when you have erected your figure ;
and in that part of the body the fign governs, the
querent will have a mole, if the quefiion be radi-
cal. For inftance ; if Aries afeend, the mole will
be on the head or face ; if Taurus, on the neck
and throat, &c. and fo upon any other part of the
body the fign afeending governs. Obferve, next,
in which of the Twelve Houfes the Lord of the
Afcendant is pofited, and in that part of the body
the fign governs which falls upon the Cufp of that
houfe w’ill the querent have another mole. Next,
obferve the fign defeending on the Cufp of the 6th
Houfe,
[ II9 ]
Houfe, and in wliateyer part of the body that figti
governs the querent will find another mole. Allb,
by the Lord of the 6th, in what houfe he is in,
as before, obferve what fign the Moon is in ;
and
the querent will find another mole, as aforefaid.
If the planet Saturn be fignificator of the mole,
it is black or dark colour ;
if Mars, and in a fiery
lign, it refembles a cut, fear, or dent, in the flefli;
but in any other fign, a red mole. If Jupiter, the
mole is purple or blue ; if the Sun, olive or chef-
nut; if Venus, yellow; if Mercury, pale lead
colour; if the Moon, a whitifli colour : but here-
in you are to mix her figniflcation according to
the planet Ibe is in afpeft with. The fignificators
mafculine, or in mafeuline figns, fignify the mark
•or mole on the right fide of the body ; if feminine,
on the left. If the fignificator of the mole be
above the horizon, the mole, &c, is vifible to the
eye, and on the fore part of the body ;
but if un-
der the earth, then on the back part of the body.
As thefe Rules will hold good upon the body of
the querent, fo will they agree upon the body of
the quefited. Suppolc a perfon enquires concern-
ing a wife or fweetheart, the yth houfe will be her
ift, 6cc. and fo judge by variation. We will once
moi e obferve, the time of receiving an horary
queflion ihould be the exaft hour and minute,
•as near as we can, the perfon defires the Artlft

to

to refolve it : If a letter, the minute the letter is
opened and read. We fliall now dirc£l how to
give judgement upon the Twelve Houfes.

In refolvlng this quelKon, and in all others,,
the Culp of the Afcendant, his Lord, and the'
' Moon,
[ I2I ]
Moon, are the querent’s fignificators.- If in a
queftion ferioully propounded you find the Lord of
the Afcendant and the Moon free from combuffion,
and from the conjundlion, quartile, or oppofition,
of the Lord of the 8th, 6th, 12th, or 4th houfes,
you may judge the querent’s life to be long, and
of a healthy conftitution ;
efpecially if you find
the aforefaid fignificators in their eflential dignities,
and in good houfes. yupiter, Venus^ or Dragon’s-
head, in the Afcendant, well fortified, and Lords
of good houfes, is an argument of longlife. The
Lord of the Afcendant in the Afcendant, or iov-'
tunate planets in yi-Art/yi? ov trine to tht J/cendani,
his Lord, or the Moon, is an argument that your
querent is of a long life ; but if you find the
Moon, or Lord of the Afcendant, peregrine or
combuft in the 8th, or the Lord of the 8th unfor-
tunate in the Afcendant, or in quartile or oppo-
fuion to the Moon, or Lord of the Afcendant, it
is a very great indicatioii of a fliort life to the
querent.
If you find the Dragon’s-tail, Saturn, or Mars,
in the Afcendant, or with the Moon, or Lord of
the Afcendant, peregrine or retrograde, and be
Lord of the 6th or 8th houfes, or having dignities
therein, you may judge the querent’s life to he
(hort, or that fome ficknefs or misfortune is ap-
proaching.

2. If an abfent Party he dead or alive ?
In refolving this queftion, be careful toconfider
what relation the querent hath to the perfon en-
quired after. If it be a brother, the 3d Houfe
and its Lord ;
and if the party enquired after be
no relation, take the Afccndant, his Lord, and the
J\'Ioon, to be the fignificator of the abfent party.
If the Lord of the ,
Afccndant, or Luna, be in
conjundlion with the Lord of the 8th, and no
good configurations of the benevolent planets, the
abfent party is certainly dead.
Or when tbe Moon and Lord of the Afcendant
are in oppofition to the Lord of the 8th, from the
2d or 8th houfes, or from the 6th or 12th houfes,
the abfent party is dead. If the Lord of the A-
feendant be in the 4th, and the Moon in the yth,
in quartile to hinr, it fnews great danger, if not:
abfolnte death. When an evil planetfhall tranflate?
the light of the Lord of the 8th unto the Lord of
the Afcendant, or of the Lord of the Afcendant:
«o the Lord of the 8th, it is moft probable the ab--
tent perfon is dead. If the Lord of the Afcendantt
and the Moon he in the 4th, or in the 8th, eitherr
combuft or in their fall, or joined with the Lord!
^4 the 8th, the perfon quefited is undoubtedly
deceafed.
[ 123 1
deceafed. If none of thefe pofitions happen, and
you find all the fignificators ftrong and well placed
in the figure, and in good afpe^f of the tortunep,
the party is alive and well. If the Lord of the
Afcendant, or the Moon, feparate from the Lord
of the 6th, the party abfent hath been lately fick ;
if from the Lord of the 8th, he has been in dan-
ger of death ;
if from the Lord of the I 2 th, he
has been in prifon, or fuffered much in mind.
By thus varying the rule, his condition, accord-
ing to the application and feparation of the figni-
ficators, Will be corredtly found.
2‘ T'owhai Part of the Worldjhall the ^lerent direSi

Having fubdivided the figure into quarters,
according to the cempais we have inferted before,
confider which of the quarters you find the good
planets in ;
they direct you to travel to that quar-
ter fignified by them. You ought perfectly to
underfiand vihat the querent hopes to attain by
his travel. If for health only, then obferve in
what quarter you find the Lord of the Afcendant
and the Moon : if they be ftrong, and in good
afpedl of the fortunate planets, they diredt your
courfe to that part of the world where the afore-
fuid fignificators are. If for riches, behold in
M2 what
[ 124 ]
what quarter you find the Lord of the 2d, the part ,
of Fortune, and his difpofitor. It for honour,
obferve in what quarter the Lord of the lOth and
Sol are. If for friends, confider the Lord of the
iith, See. Carefully avoid that quarter of the
Heavens where are Saturn, Mars, or Oragon’s-tail,
if they be Lords of the 12th, 8th, or 6th houfes, i
and in quartile or oppojiticn to the Moon, or Lord
of the Afcendant.
4. Shall the Querent find the pe'fon at home he'
defires to fpeak tvhh ?
The truth I have always found, as well as my
friends, in the anfuers to this queftion, has in-
duced me to give it a place here: I have never-
known it to fail ;
and it is of very effential confe-
quence to a man in trade, and of treble the value:
of the Book, only the knowledge of this queftion..
The rules are thefe : If you would fpeak with ai
perfon that you have familiar or conftant dealing;
with, but are not related to, take the 7th Houfe, andl
his Lord, to fignify him ;
that is, the 7th from
the Afcendant. If the Lord of the 7th be in any
of the four angles, viz. ift, 4th, 7th, or lotht
Houfes, the perfon you would fpeak with is cer-
tainly at home then. If the Lord of the 7th be:
in any of the Succedent Houfes, viz. in the 2d,,
5th,.
[ 125 ]
5th, 8th, or nth, he is net then at home, but
very near home, and may be found if fought
after. But if the Lord of the yth be in any Ca-
dent Houfe, viz. 3d, 6th, 9th, or 12th, the party
is not at home, but tar diftant from home, and
confequently is not to be fpoken V'ith. If the
Lord of the Afcendant apply to the Lord of the
yth by conjun£tton, or good afpe£f, you may con-
clude you will meet with the party, or hear of him
by the way, where he is. If the Moon, or any
other planet, transfer the light of the Lord of the
7th to the Lord of the Afcendant, you (hall know
w'here he is by fuch a perfon as that planet repre-
fents who transfers his light, according to the
fign and quarter he is pofiied in, v/hether mafeu-
line or feminine, or whether man or woman,
will inform you; and judge by the greater tefti-
monies : but if the perfon enquired alter be a re-
lation, then the Lord of the 7th is not to be taken,
but the Lord of that houfe lignifying fuch relation.
If it be a brother, the Lord of the 3d muft be
referred to; if a lather, take the Lord of the 4th ;
a mother, the loih; if fons or daughters, obferve
the Lord of the 5th ;
and fo on ;
and, according
to their pofitions, judge, as before recited.

the vefTel and her burthen ; but the Lord of the
Afcendant is fignificator of the perfons that fail in
her. If all thefe appear fortunate, they fignify
that the fhip is fafe, and in profperity ;
on the
contrary, if they are found impedited or alHi(51ed,
the veflTel and all in her are in imminent danger,
if not lod. When an evil planet, having digni-
ties in the 8th, (hall be in the Afcendant, or the
Lord
[ 127 ]
Lord of the Afcendant in the 8th, in bad afpc£i:
with the Lord of the 8th, 12th, 6th, or 4th, or
if the J) be combuft under the Earth, all thefe are
indications of danger, and denote the (hip to be
loft, or in a defperate fituation. But when all the
fignificators are free, and no way impedited, it
indicates the flaip to be in a good and profperous
condition, and alfo all the perfons on board her.
If the Afcendant and the D be unfortunate,
and the Lord of the Afcendant ftrong and in a
good houfe, it denotes the fhip to be in an ill
condition ; but the men on board her will do well,
and come home in fafety ; but if the Afcendant
and ]) (hall be fortunate, and the Lord of the
Afcendant unfortunate, it (hews the veflel will do
well, or is in fafety; but that her crew are in
danger of death by fome fever, or of being taken
by the enemy.
Any perfon may naturally enquire what fuccefs
a fhip fhall have in her voyage. Upon her firfl:
fetting fail, you muft obferve the angles of the
figure; and if the fortunate planets and the ])
(fhe is Lady of the feas) are found therein, and
1
the unfortunate planets cadent, combuft, or under
the Sun’s beams, not affliiSling the 5 , or Lord of
the Afcendant, you may conclude the fhip and
cargo
[ 128 ]
cargo will go fafe into the defired port. But if
the Infortunes be angular, or in fuccedent, fhe
will meet with fome accident in her voyage, and
the misfortune will happen in that part of the fhip,
perfon, &c. fignifted by the fign where the Infor-
tune is pofited. If b or afflict the Lord of the
angles, the men will be in danger of death, cne- |
ir.ics, or pirates. If the loth be infortunated by
^ ,
and near violent fixed ftars, and Mars in a.
humane fign, the Ihip will be in danger of being I
burnt by the enemy, or lightening, or accident.
The fire will begin in that part of tliefliip denoted I
by the fign wherein the evil planet is placed in the*!
figure, if the aforefaid fignificator be quick ini'
motion, the fiiip will fail fwiftly, and make a ftiorfJ
voyage. If it happen that there is a or 5
between the Lord of the Afcendant and the dif-
pofer of the ]) ,
without reception, there will be
difcorcl .^nd contention amongft the feamen, or’
there will be much difpute between the Captainb
and crew, or a mutiny. The Ilrongeft fignificator*
will overcome; that is, if the Lord of the Afcen--*
dant is more fortified than the difpolitor of the 5 ,,i
the men will overcome ; but if the difpofitor of the:i
Moon beftronger than the Lord of the Afcendant,,
the Captain or Owner will prevail.
Questions*'
[ r29 ]
Qjjestions belonging to the Second House,
or Houfe of Subftance.
The following, amongfl: others, properly belong
to it.
1 . Shall the ^erent be rich or poor ?
2. How or by what means Jhall he attain Riches?
3. Shall the ^lerent obtain the Money lent^ orfor
Goods fold and delivered?
1. Shall the Querent ^^Vich or poor?
In refolving this queftion, if the party en-
quiring is truly ferious in his enquiries, his figni-
ficators are theAlcenclant, hisLord, and theMoon;
the 2d Houfe, his Lord, *
and part of Fortune,
fhall fignify his eftates, together with the planets
pofited in the 2d, and the planets in afpe£t to the
hgnificators. If you find the fignificators, viz,
the Lord of the 2d, and part of Fortune, and the
difpofitor of Fortune, in angles, efientially ftrong,
it is a good argument of riches. If the Lord of
the Afcendant, or the Moon, apply to the Lord of
the 2d by body or good afpetfl, from good houfes
in the figure, it is a great argument in favour of
riches. The Lord ot the Afcendant, or Moon,
in the 2d, in their eflentiai dignities, in good afpedb
to Jupiier or Venus, the Moon or any other planet
transferring
[ ]
transferring the light of the Lord of the 2cl to the;
Lord orthe ift or Afcendant, the querent fiiall at^-
tain riches, and live in efteem beyond his capacity?
of birth. If Jupiter, who is natural ftgnificator:
of riches, or V^enus, or Dragon’s-head, be free;
from the malevolent beams of the Infortunes, and!
be pofited in the 2d, the querent will be rich ;
if:
in fixed figns, it will continue the longer. Saturn,,
Mars, or Dtagon’s-tail, in the 2d, peregrine, retro-
grade, or afflidling the Lord of the 2d, Jupiter,.
Venus, or the Part of Fortune, it is a very ftrongg
argument of poverty.
2. Hozu cr by vihat means fiiall he attain Riches ?
If you have found the querent fhall obtain-
riches, you may know from w'hence it tvill come,
by the following Rules :
If the Lord of the 2d be in the 2d, the querent,
will attain riches, or an eftate, by merchandize,,
or his own induftry.—If the Lord of the 2d be in
the ifi, free from combuftion or other afRiiSfinn,,
he (liall have riches in a manner unexpeiledly. —
If the Lord of the 2d be in the 3d, in good afpe(ft j
by his neighbours or kindred, or bv inland iv>ur—
nies. —If he be in the 4.th, and fortunately placedl
in good afpedl of the Lord of the 4th, the quercntt
will attain riches by his father ; and fo of the
reft, hz.
C 131 ]
3. Shall the Querent obtain the Money lent, or due
for Goods fold and delivered?
The Afcendant, &c. as before, fignify the que-
rent. If it be a friend, or a perfon you are con-
verfant with, and not related to, take the 7th
Houfe and his Lord to fignify the quefited perfon.
The 8th, the 2d from the 7th, fhall fignify his
eftate. Then judge by the following Rule :
The Lord of the Afcendant, or the Moon, in
conjunction, or in good afpeff with the Lord of the
8th, or with a planet in the 8th elTentially dignified;
the querent (hall attain the goods or money en-
quired after.
The Lord of the 8th in the Afcendant, or in
the 2d, in reception with the Lord of the 2d ;
it
'is a great argument that he lhall get his money or
goods ;
and if the aforefaid fignificators apply by
quartile or oppofition, with reception, it denotes
the fame, but not with much eafe, &c. But if the
Lord of the 7th or 8th fhall be pofited in the ift
Or 2d, and be not received by the Lord of the
Afcendant, nor the Moon, or Lord of the 2d ;
it
; fhews the querent will not only go without his
defire; but if he purfues the bufinefs, he will fuf-
tain much lofs and detriment.

Judgements proper to the Third House.
Brethren, fitters, kindred, neighbours, inland
journies, rumours, advice of friends, &c. ap-*
pertain to this Houfe. —Queftions agreeable tO(
thefe, and the following, are moft: applicable,,
or moft eafily folved by this Houfe.
1. Shall the ^jerent, his Brothers, Si/lers, Neigh-'
hours, agree F
Advice of a Friend, if good or bad ?
1, Shall the Querent, his Brothers, ^c. agree F
The Moon, the Afcendant, and its Lord, are’
the fignificators of the querent^ the 3d Houfe and.
its Lord, of the quefited. The queflion is thus-
folved : If the Lord of the 3d Houfe be a benevo--
lent planet, and in the Afcendant, or the Mooni
be in good afpeot with "k fortunate planet in the 3d
the querent and his brothers, &c. will agree well.
When the Lord of the Afcendant and Lord of'
the 3d are in Textile or trine to each other, and in
mutual reception, or the Lord of the 3d cafts a-
fextile or trine to the cufp of the Afcendant, and'
the Lord of the Alcendant or the Moon cafts the
fame to the cufp of the 3d Houfe j
it is an argu-
ment
[ ns ]
ment of great unity, love, and concord, between
them. When a good planet is in the Afcendant,
and the Lord of the ift beholds the ciifp of the
3d, or applies friendly to the Lord of the 3d; it is
an argument of a good difpobtion in the cjuerent,
and indicates he is defirous of agreeing with his
brothers, neighbours, kc. and if a Fortune be in
the 3d, and the Lord of the 3d apply in harmony
to the Lord of the ift, the brothers, &c. are moft
indulging. Thofe perfons whofe fignificators do not
apply, are moft imperious, and apt to difagree ; and
thofe perfons whofe fignificators make application,
are flexible, willing and defirous of peace and
concord. When Saturn, Mars, or the Dragon’s-
tail, in fuch a queftion, (hall be in the Afcendant,
it denotes the enquirer to be obftinate, and averfe
to a friendly agreement; but if any of them are
pofited in the 3d, the brothers, &c. are of a ma-
licious difpofition : and if it happens that Saturn,
or Mars are peregrine, retrograde, or combuft,
the malice or mifehief they threaten will be the
more hurtful. When Saturn or Dragon s-tail are
in the 3d, the neighbours are clownifti, obftinate,
and the kindred covetous and fparing: if Mars,
the kindred are treacherous, and <he neighbours
dlfhoneft: and this is certain when they are out
of their dignities.
2. Advice
[ 134 ]
2. Advice of a Frlenf if good or bad ?
It is remarkable, when a man is in diftrefs,
trouble, or anxiety, he will apply to a friend,
how to act in his embarrafled ftate. If you defire
to know if they intend faithfully or deceitfully,
eredb your figure to the moment of time they gave
you their advice ;
and judge as follows The loth
Houfe fignifies advice and counfel :
you are to
confider if that Houfe is fortunate or afflidled ;
if "JupiUr^ Venus^ or Dragon’s-head^ be in the
loth Houfe, or if the Moon apply by body or
afpecl to the Lord of the ift, the advice, counfel,
or perfuafion, is good j
or if either of the For-
tunes fo pofited, fhall apply by fextile or trine to
the Lord of the ift or Afcendant, it denotes the
fame : but if Saturn, Mars, or Dragon s-tail, pe-
regrine in the loth, then you may conclude your
neighbour is a knave, or your friend full of de-
ceit, and only pretends to friendfhip. If the fign
afeending be a moveable fign, and the Lord of the
ift and Moon be in moveable figns, you may
fafely pafs the fame judgement.

An Infortune or Dragon’s-tail in the 7th denotes'
the contrary. If you find the Lord of the 7th in
good afped with the Lord of the ilf, or the Lord
of the I lb in good afpcct to a planet in the 7 th,
the querent will obtain favour from his landlord,
and generous dealing, &c.
A fortunate planet in the loth, or in fexfile or

querent will conclude a bargain.
If an Infortune be in the icth, the parties willi
differ about repairs or buildings, Mr. Lilly fays.
The goodnefs of it is known by the fituation off
the Lord of the 4th, if afflivfled or not; and the

2. Th find any thing loft, hidden, or miflaid.
In this queftion you ought carefully to confider
•whom the property loft belongs to. If the father,
the 5th Houfc to indicate the thing loft, becaufe
the 5th is the 2d from the 4.th, therefore ftgnifies
his father, eftate, he. and fo on of the reft, in
order. If 'tis the querent’s own goods loft, &c.
then judge as under : If the Lord of the 2d be in
any of the four angles, the thing enquired after is
in the houfc of the querent; if the Lord of the
2d be poftted in the Afcendant, or in conjundfion
with the Lord of the ift, the thing is hid or mif-
laid in that part of the houfe which he himfelf
moft frequents.
If the Lord of the 2d be in the lOth, it is in
the hall or dining-room, if ’tis a gentleman :
enquire, if a trader, in his fliop, warehoufe, he.
But if the Lord of the 2d be in the 7th, the goods
are hid or miHaid in that part of the houfe his
wife or maid fervants frequent, or are in, gene-
rally. ’
The nature and quality of the place v/here the
things are, is known by the nature of the ftgns
where you find the Lord of the 2d, the Moon, or
Fortune, pofited. If you find the major part of
the fignificators in fiery figns, the goods loft are
N 3 near
near the chimnies, or where iron is laid ; If in
airy figns, in the upper part of the houfe, or above
the ground floor ; if in watery figns, it is near
fome water ;
if in earthy figns, near fome pave-
ment or floor laid on the ground, or earth. The-
quarter or part of the houfe where the thing is hid,
loft, &c. is known from the nature of the figns;
and quarter they fignify j
as I have before ex-
plained in the Firft Part of this Book. Thus;
having obferved carefully where the fignificators .
are pofited, you are to judge by the major tefti--
monies; and they will dircdl you to the quarter*
of the Heavens, and nature of the place, where*
the thing is loft. See. as I have proved true by*
repeated experiments*.

[ 139 ]
The Student, by feeing thefe queftions refolved,
will be able to anfwer any other belonging to this
Houfe.
I. If a Woma,n enquiring be with Child or not?
The queflion is found by the following rules :—
The Afcendant, his Lord, and the Moon, are^the
fignificators of the woman enquiring : —The Lord
of tlie ift, or the Moon, applying to the Lord of
the 5th, by conjun£iion^ fextile
^
or trine^ from good
houfes, or if the Adoon or Lord of the Afcendant
be pofited in the 5th, it is an argument the que-
rent is with child.
When the fignificators apply friendly, or are
pofitcd in fruitful figns or houfes, as the 5th,
iith, and 7th, or if Jupiter be there, the party
enquiring is with child : but if Jupiter, the na-
tural fignincator of children, be cadent, or af-
flidtcd, the woman enquiring is not with child,
Likewife, if the Moon, and the Lords of theTri-
plicity (he is in, be well pofited in figns of many
children, as Cancer, Scorpio, and Pifees, the wo-
man has conceived. So, if Jupiter and Venus be
in angles, free from the malicious beams of the
Infortunes, the woman is certainly with child :
but if the fignificators arc afflided by Saturn,
Mars
[ 140 j
Mars, or Dragon’s-tail, the woman is not v/ith
child, but is troubled with fome diforder flie has
miftalcen for conception. Saturn, Mars, and Dra-
gon’s-tail, in the 5th, (hew non-conception ;
but
if it happen that the teftimonies or proofs for her
being with child are greater in number than tbofe
that fignify non-conception, they then threaten
abortion or mifearriage : the fame when the evil
planets aiflift Venus, the Moon, or the Lords of
the 5th or Afcendant.
2, If the JVoman is pre^nant^ or zuith a Boy
or Girl?
To anfwcr this queftion, obferve the Afcendant,
his Lord, and the 5th Houfe or I.ord of it, toge-
ther with the Moon, and planet to whom (lie ap-
plies ;
for if they, or mofl: of them, be in mafeu--
line fign®, the querent is with child of a boy;,
but if in feminine figr.s, of a girl. 7'he faid fig--
nificators, though in feminine figns, yet if they
are in afpecl of mafculine planets, and in houfea
mafeuline, the woman will have a male child.
Mafculine planets are Saturn^ Alars, Jupiter^ and
the Sun\ the feminine are Venus and the Aloon.
Mercury is in his nature convertible, and is either
mafculine or feminine, according to the planet he
is in afped with, Signs of a mafculine nature or

3. Shall a Verfon gain or lofe at Cards, Dice, or
any other Game ?
To refolve this queftion, you are to give the
Lord of the Afcendant and the Moon to the que-
rent : the 5th Houfe and Lord thereof fhall fignify
your lofs or gain by any game or play; the 7th
koufe and his Lord, the perfon you play with.
If you find the Lord of the Afcendant in the
5th, or Lord of the 5th in the Afcendant, in their
eflential dignities, noways afilidied by the prefence
of the evil planets, or their malevolent rays, it is
an argument the querent will gain by his play, &c.
Likewife, if you find the Lord of the Afcendant
in conjundiion, fextile, or trine, to the Lord of the
5th, efpecially if they apply to the aforefaid good
afpedts, in their dignities, or if they be in recep-
tion^ you may pafs the fame judgement.
If you find the Lord of the 5th fcparating from
any good afpedt from the Lord of the 8th (which
is the quefited’s houfe of lubftance) to the Lord
of
[ 142 ]
©f the Afcendant, or Lord of the 2d, it is an ar-
gument the querent will win by his play. If a»
benevolent planet is pofited in the 5th, having;
eflential dignities in the 5th, and do caft his bene--
volent afpefts to the Lord of the 5th,^ or Lord off
the ift, judge the fame : but if, on the contrary,,
you find the Lord of the Afcendant, or Moon,,
or Lord of the 2d, affli£led by the Lord of the:
^th, 7th, or 8th Houfes, it is an argument theu
querent will lofe by his play, &c. Or if you findlj
the Lord of the 5th in the 7th, or in reception i|
with the Lord of the 7th, or in good configura-*j
tion or afpedt thereunto, or if the Lord of the 5thi|
leparate from the Lord of the 2d, and apply by'
any good afpedf to the Lord of the 8th, it is ai
proof the querent will lofe money by his game of
play, &c.
If you find equal teftimonies, you may judge’
the molt powerful fignificator wins the game; buf
if there happen to be three of one, and four of
the other, always decide in all quefiions in favour
of the greater number of reafons or teftimpnics.

Of the Sixth House, and Questions naturally
belonging to it.
From this Houfe judgement is given on fick-
nefs, fervants, fmall cattle, that is, flieep, hogs,
&c. and the following Qiieflions are com-
monly decided by it, as well as others fimilar.
1. TVhat part of the body is afliSied?
2. What is the caufe of the difeafe?
3. Shall the ftck party recover, or die of the
difeafe ?
I. What Part of the Idody is afliSded?
Having erected the figure, obferve the Afcend-
ant, the 6th Houfe, and place of the Moon ; they
are naturally fignificators of the difeafe ; then judge
as follows : —T. he Horofcope or ift Houfe, afflicted
by the prefence of an evil planet, or the Dragon’s-
tail, indicates plainly the difeafe lies chiefly in the
head, and in that member or part of the body de-
fcribed by the fign afcending. If the Moon be
afflicted by the Infortunes, the fick party is afflicted
;in that part of the body the planet governs from
jhis own houfe*. If the Afcendant be Scorpio, and
Mars and Venus in the Afcendant or 6th Houfe,
« the

s
[ U4 J
the Hifeafe lies in the head, bowels, and fecrets
becaufe Mars governs thofe members in either
place: which rules hold good with all the other ;
fi^ns and planets. The difeafes natural to the
t?
.... . j
planets and figns are particularifed in the Firft
Part of this Work. You mull: always reckon the
Afccndant, let what fign will aCcend : the i ft Houfe •'
figniftes the head and face ;
the 2d Houfe, neck and
thi-oat J
and fo on.
2. is the Caufe of the Difeafe^ or Diforder? '
The caufe is known from the pofition of the^
fignificators (after you have feen, as before, ini
the other figures, the part affli^fed) in the fourr
trigons or triplicities ;
for therein fhew they the
humours predominant. If moft of the fignifica--
tors arc pofited in fiery figns, they declare the dif-
order to have its origin from choler; whence fe-
'
vers and fuch fort of diforders proceed. If theyv'
'
are in airy figns, blood is then predominant in the.
*
body, and caufes gouts, leprofies, &c. When thee
fignificators of ficknefs are in earthy figns, they:
indicate ftrongly the caufe of the difeafe to pro-
'
-ceed originally from melancholy ; and thofe dif-'
eafes are long and tedious, bringing' on confump* i
*
tions, agues, nervous affedlions. See. The fig'<
nificators in watery figns denote the difeafe to pro->i
1
ceeti
ii
t 145 3
ceed from cold and raoift caufes, as phleghms,
coughs, phthifics, and all difeafes of the ftomach,
and frequently the bowels.
3* Shall the Jtck Perf
on die, or recover of the Difeafe?
You are to confider the Afcendant and Lord
thereof, and Luna. If you find Jupiter, Venus,
Sol, and Luna, in the Afcendant, not afflidled by
the Lord of the 8th, nor yet Lord of the 8th*
themfelves, promife a fpeedy recovery. The Moon,
or Lord of the Afcendant, feparating from an evil
planet, or from the Lord of the 6th, and applying
to a Fortune well placed in the figure, denotes the
fame.
i
If Luna be angular, well pofited, free from the
body Jind beams of Adars and Saturn, or the Lord
of Death ; or if the Moon be void of courfe, and
behold a good planet On a celeftial day ;
it is a fign
of recovery, elpecialJy if ihe be in her exaltation.
If the Bencvolents are ftronger than the Male*
Volents, and they behold the Afcendant Lord there-
of, or be in good afpeft to the Moon, it is an
argument of recovery.
In refpe£l to death, the Lord of the Afcendant
and the Moon combufl of the Sun denote death,
nnlefs there be feme reception between the Sun
O and
146 ]
atid them ;
and if they fhall be in conjundion with
the Lord of the 8th, except Jupiter and Venus in-
terpofe their friendly beams, they ihew the fame.
The Lord of the 8th in an angle, and the Moon
and .Lord of the Afcendant cadent, or afflidled of
the Infortunes, prefage mortality. The applica-
tion of the Lord of the Afcendant, or the Moon,
unto the Lord of the 8th, by evil afpedf, (hews
death; and if he be an Infortune, it puts the
matter paft all doubt. The Lord of the ift in the
4th, 6th, or 7th Houfes, afflidled, portends death.
The Lord of the ift in the 8th, or the 8th in the
ift, gives judgement of mortality.

or either of the Fortunes, the party enquiring may
i marry. When the Lord of the ifi, the D or $ ,
F are in the 7th, or in the dignities of the Lord of
I the 7th, and the Lord of the 7th in the Afcendant,
I or in fextile or trine to the faid fignificator, the
querent will certainly marry. If none of thefe
appear, but the fignificators are » in barren figns,
in or S to the Lord of the 7th, the party en-
quiring is averfe to marriage.
2. What kind of Perfon Jhall the ^erent marry ?
If a man afk the queftion, confider what planet
the Moon is in afpedl with ;
if a woman alk it,
confider Sol ;
alfo what planet the Lord of the
Afcendant is in afpedl with, or the planet in the
Afcendant ; and judge here, and at all times, by
the ftrongeft arguments, I mean the greateft tefti-
O 2 monies,
i i
[ hs •]
monies, and thofe which are in beft reception.
Then confider the nature of that planet, whatfignii
he is in, how afFedled or affli<^led; and by confi-o
deration hereof you may defcribe the perfon, his.l
quality, and difpofition; as you are directed in.\
the Firft Parc of this Book, where the natures of'‘
the Planets and Signs are dwelt on very fully. If;|
the Lord of the ift or the Moon be in conjun£fionii
or good afpe£t with Venus, the perfon is affable,,
pleafant, &c. if with the Sun, noble, generous,,
&c. Mars is rafli and furious, &c. and fo on.
3, Shall Tivo Partners agres, and be fuccefsful Im
Partnerjhip ?
The Lord of the Afcendant and 7th being;
friends, according to nature, and in reception or*
good arpe«Sl with each other, declare the partners?
Ihall agree together, and gain immenfely by theirr
undertaking. If they be enemies by nature, as is?
fecn in the Table in the Firft Part, and are voidl
of good rays towards one another, and in no re--
ception, it is an argument they never will agree,,
but will be jangling, and injuring each other.
If the Lord of the Afcendant be a more weighty
planet than the Lord of the 7th, and better dig--
nified, it Ihsws the querent will thrive beft in the.*
partnerfliip y,
C 149 ]
partncrflilp ; but if the Lord of the 7th be moft
ponderous, the quefited gains moft. Mars or
Mercury Lord of the 2d, affliiling the Lord of
the 8th, ftiews the querent will cheat his partner;
but if either of them be Lord of the 8th, and af-
flict the Lord of the 2d, the partner will cheat
the querent. He whofe fignificators are ftrongeft
will profper bcft in the partnerftiip ;
he whofe fig-
niftcators are weakeft will be injured ; if they are
in evil places in the figure.
4. Who is the Thief; of ivhat Age^ and Sex F
The planet or planets affliiSting the fignificator
I
of Subftance, or the part of Fortune and his dif-
pofitor, fignify the thief. The fignificator of the
the thief is either the Lord of the 7th, if he aftlidl
the Subftance ; or, as fome fay, the peregrine
planet in an angle fignifies the thief, if he afflicts
the Lord of the 2d and part of Fortune; but
confider that planet who has dignities in the 7th,
and prefer the planet in the Afccndant before any
in other angles; the lOth next; then the 7th;
and, laftly, the 4th : but pray notice what planet
afflirfts the part of Fortune, and his Lord or dif-
pofitor. Many planets in angles indicate many
thieves. If the planet afftidting the Subftance,
&c. be mafculine, and in a mafculine fign and
O 3
quarter,
f
[ ISO ]
ijuarfer, it is i man ; if the planet and figns be
feminine, a woman. Saturn fignificator of the i
thief fhews he is old, except he is in the begin-
ning of figns j
Sun, Mars, or Jupiter, about 30, 1
or more; Venus and Mercury, young. The i
Moon, according to her age; in the ift quarter,
young; in the 2d quarter, 20 or 30; in the 3dj |
between 30 and 45 ;
in the laft,
45 or 60.
Of the Eighth House, the Houfe of Death, iffc. <
We may fafely conjeftute what manner of death
the querent may die; but to afeertain the exa£t
time of any perfon’s death is extremely vague and
uncertain, except by a Nativity ;
which, if it can ^
be obtained, let all Horary Queftions give way tot'
it; as they are only fubftitutes in the place of ai
perfon’s figure of birth.
TVhat DeathJhall the Querent die, natural or violent ?
Either the Lord of the 8th, or planet pofited ini'
the 8th, (hew the kind of death the querent mayd
die; due reference being paid to the planets be-*(
holding him or them. If the fignificator be If. orr!
? ,
in their cliential dignities, they denote a na—I
tural, eafy death 3 except violent fixed flats arc.;
near them.
If
[ 151 ]
If 7^ be fignificator, he denotes death by agues,
dropfy, or confumption ; d" by fevers, &c. the O
by pleurifies, or obftrudlion of the vitals ; ^ by
frenzy, madnefs, phthific, &c. and the D by drown-
ing, or difeafes of a cold and moift nature.
Fiery figns fhew death from fire, guns, See.
;
watery figns, by water. The fignificator of mor-
tality in n , ^ , or the laft part of 4^ , by a horfe,
if the luminaries are pofited in violent figns, not
beholding each other, prefages a violent death.
We have given a figure and judgement on a

The Afcendant, his Lord, and the Moon, are:!
always fignificators of the querent. The loth I

fignificator of honour and dignity, to reprefentti

rays, is an argument he fliall obtain the prefer-i
tnent, &c.
If you find the Lord of the loth in the Afcen—

to Sol, or to a good planet in the icth, the fame;;
or if you find the Lord of the iffc or the D ini

other ftrong conclufion.
The 5 or any fortunate planet feparating from’
the Lord of the loth, and applying to the Lord
of the Afcendant either by body or afpct^, denotes'
the fame.

Shall the ^erent obtain what he hopes for ?
When this queftion is propounded in a general
way, then let the Afcendant and his Lord, with
the planet pofited in the nth Houfe and his Lord,
be fignificator.
If you fee the Lord of the ifi: or Luna applying
to a fextile or trine of the Lord of the nth, the
querent will obtain whatever he hopes for.
The Lord of the Afcendant or Luna in the
nth, no way afflicted, but in reception with the
Lord of the nth, denotes the very fame.

peclally if the Lord ©f the 12th is in a moveable
gn, and he in good afpe£t to a fortunate ftar ©r
lanet. The Lord of the Afcendant, or the Moon,
any of the cadent Houfes, denotes long con-
nement. If the Lord of the ift is afHi(^ed b)r'
aturn or Mar?, or is under the Sun’s beams, or
trograde, it (hews long imprifonment. If the
ifortune be Lord of the 8 th, he will die in pri-
n. A fixed fgn afcending, denotes long re*
raint, if the Lord of the ift is a ponderous pla-
et : common fgns, not fo long : moveable fgnsy

time before the party (liall be releafed from

A Gentleman applied to my Friend in thesi

ing figure to the precife time of night he defiredi
to be refolved.

We allow the Moon 6 hours motion ;

I deg. in 2 hours. This queftion concerns the
I 2d Houfe, that being the hcufe of fubftance, the
! Moon muft be confulted with the fign of the 2d
'
and loth. Leo, the fign afcending, exa6lly de-
. fcribed the gentleman enquiring, he being a large
Jmafculine perfon, and an intrepid countenance,
Pfree and generous, &c. See page 13. We find
oj no planet angular but Mars, and he has little to
q
do in this queftion. The Lords of the 2d and 6th >
Bare both fuccedent, and both the luminaries ca-
T dent, in the 6th, and in conjundion with that
moft evil planet Saturn, who is in his own houfe
It and fign : he is hurtful here; neither does the fex-
i tile of yield much benefit to the querent. The
T Sun, his fignificator, is not fortunate, but ca-
M dent, and in detriment, not having got up to the
I fign of the 7th : Venus in >f is afflided by Sa-
I turn, and then fine receives her firft quartile in
I her natural and local courfe. The queftion being
I by night, the Moon muft be laid to have more
dominion than the Sun. If rules by day, and ^
by night, in bis triplicity ; ^ Lord of the houfe
of wealth, applies, by body and afped, to evil
planets: the Sun, Lord of 0, is much afflided,
argues lofs. For the above reafons 1 was obliged
to inform the gentleman, that his ticket would
be drawn a blank, in a few days ;
which accord-

ingly happened on the loch of February, 1786, f<d-
^
lowing,when theMoon wasinoppofition to 5 ,Lojd
of the querent’s 2d. We would advife the young
artift to take down the time when he infures or
buys a ticket, and eredl the figure from that exadl
minute, as near as he can.
Had there been a Fortune in the 2d or loth
houfe, or m2iny planets in angles, or the D , $ , or ^ ,

perfon would have had a prize of great value j but

daysj but, owing to his particular friends and re-
lations being all out of town, he was greatly at a
lofs to raife 5I. towards it, as he had no banker.
He faid he had 150I. in good bills, and defired
me to difcount one. I told him I could not till
the latter end of next week. He faid he had tried
all
[ 159 1
all his acquaintance in vain. He then defired me
to eredl a figure. I accordingly did, as under;

but that he j

from the afpedls and pofitions of the Fortunes in
this figure, there being no malevolent ones to
counteracSl their good effects. I hefitated not to
acquaint my friend, 1 thought he would be in pof-
feffion of the cafli he flood in need of, the next
day; becaufe the D, which brings all fublunary
things to pafs, is fo near to a trine of Mars, the
querent’s fignificator. This queftion properly be-
longs to the 2d Houfe. I’he iffue of the bufinefs
was, that a perfon who had been fchoolfellcw
called on him the next morning, to breakfafl, who
lived 120 miles olf, in the N.W. part of England,
and helped him to the money; though it is moft:
aflonifhing to think, that he had not feen him for

Iquestion 3. Is Jhe a Maul or Virgin that ajks
a ^uejlion ?
I
My Profeffional Friend had a defire to know, if
the young woman that lately came to him about
i
fome bufinefs, was a maid or not. He eredted
the following figure for that purpofe. I have in-
i
ferted this, becaufe it is a nice figure. In fome
I
.
“
we may fee quite evidently if they are maids or
debauched.
This figure was ereded 10 min. before Eleven
c’CIock, or 22 h. 50 min. pad Noon.
I ob-
[ 1^2 ]
I obferve, that an aftrologial hour or day begins
at noon, and ends the next day at noon.
Fiaft, I confider if ? Lord of the Afcendant in
^ deferibes her, or the hgn afeending. 1 find
that Venus in Aquarius cxaiflly reprefents the
young woman ;
fhe being handfome, of a well-
lhaped body, an excellent complexion, good-na-
tured, and full of vivacity. b in a fixed fign,
lier iff; Venus, Lord of "I'aurus, is fixed alfo ;
both thefe teftimonies afiure me fhe is chafte. She
is (5 v^ith Tp O in the loth; fuppofe her to be a
i'ervant belonging to a perfon of fafhion ; and ? ,
her fignificatof, is’Lord of almoft all the 6ch Houle;
(d) is cadent, difpofed of by D , who is cadent alfo ;
.which confirms me in it.
I find many planets angular, and her fignificator
;vvith that noble Monarch of Heaven, Sol ; ^ alfo
in his own and If both in his own Houfe
and Triplicity. Thefe are all teflimonies of virtue.
She has not had any child ; SI occupies the cufpt
of the 5th Houfe ;
but that file has had great trials
for her honour, is indicated by £5 being near the:
cufp of the 5th ;
and ? being in conjumflion withi
Tp ,
Lord of the 10th, undoubtedly I think it was'
with her mafter fhe dived with. After weighing;
the above 1 pronounced her an honourable and
handfome virgin.

[ 1^3 ]•
Had the Lord of the Afcendant been with
moveable or common figns, or a fruithil fign on
the 5th, or ? ifi the 5th, in evil alpecSl to Infortunes,
I fhould have deemed her lewd and unchafte. Q
in the 7th is a certain proof of the woman’s chaf-
tity or conftancy to one man ;
becaufe the Sun is
foie Lord of the Heavenly Spheres. This reafon
always holds good. One great thing in this wo-
man’s favour, is, Mars Lotd of the 7th in the
ift : let her marry when (lie will, fhe will not
defile her marriage- bed
Question 4. Gentleman made Enquiry, If his
Voyage to the Weji-Indies Jhould he fafe and profpe-
rous, for he was going out in a Ship of IVar for
a three Tears Station ?
A figure was made, agreeable to the following
;
and this, with what has been inferted on a Ship
at Sea, in the former Part, will enable any ma-
riner, or fea officer, to judge for himfclf on the
fuccefs and fafety of any voyage.
Cliriftian Aftrology is not only lawful, but effentially ufeful.
At the fame time, the beft things in the world may be proftituted

This queftion chiefly regards the 9th Houfe
and the 2d. The iign afcending on the 9th, and
his Lord perfonating K, is a watery fign. The

the Lady of the Ocean, has principal domi-
nion, efpecially as (he is Lady of the Afcendant;
which fignifies the perfon fetting fail for the
Weftern World. The Weftern fign muft be con-
fidered, as well as the 2d Houfe, which intimates
his fubftance or gain ; likewife the loth, how for--
tified and dignified*

To proceed; we find the 9th a watery fign ;

[ i66 ]
From long experience, we find the Lord of the
9th, well dignified, in long journies, and either
of the Fortunes in it, is good. The J fortunate,
the 2d Houfe fortunate, by i; or ? ,
or friendly
afpedt from them or ^ , ftiews riches.
The moft ftrong teftimonies of ill fortune are,
if lb d' £3 falls in the 2d Houfe, or 9th, not in
any of their elTential dignities.

Qjjestion 7. If'
hat Part of the Body Is aftidied ?
In the former Part of this Work I have fliewn 1
what difeafes are attributed to each Planet, Houfe,
and Sign; I now come to give an Example of
them ; as this Queftion has reference to the 6th
Houfe. i
'
A friend of mine, being very bad, applied to
me, if 1 could defcribe his complaint j as he found
himfelf vaftly ill. 1 erected the following figure,
and gave judgement as follows, briefly* ;
[ ^71 ]
I had no doubt of the queftion being radical,
as the party vras fcarce able to walk. Scorpio be-
ing on the Cufp of the ift, gives Mar's for his fig-
nificaior, pofited in the 6th or Houfe of Sicknefs,
and in oppofition to the 12th Houfe of Affliaion
and Trouble j and I told him I fuppofed he had
one very difagreeable complaint, one in parti-
cular, which I defcribed to be an ulcer in the
bladder or kidnies, or the ftone, by Scorpio being
on the ift ; and Mars his lignificator in the Houfe
of Sicknefs, indicates a diforder in his head alfo,
and fubjeft todiforders in the reins, kidnies, blad-

Saturn, fituated in Scorpio, indicated the fame.
So here are three reafons to conclude, he being
married, that was his complaint; otherwife I fhould
have been inclined to think venereal pleafuies had
been the caufe. He had alfo a diforder in the fto-
mach ;
which is eafily feen by Venus Lord of the
6th being in Cancer. He frankly faid he believed
I had told him the truth exadly, and juft hit hb
difeafe.

[ 172 ]
Question 8. Shall the Querent obtain the Legacy
promifed ?
The following qucftion on legacies I Ihall con-
clude with : —A perfon of a good-natured, affable
diTpofition, called on me, to know concerning a
legacy his wife’s mother had often promifed to
leave them at her death j
but lately he had grofsiy*
affronted her by his licentious way of life. Know-
ing the queftion tq be perfedfly radical, I credfed
the following figure, and gave him my opinion
judicially. This queftion properly belongs to the
8th Houfe.
Mercury
C 173 ] .
•
Mercury is Lord of the Afcendant, and fignifi-
cator of tlie querent ; he is fituated in the 7th
Houfe, and difpofes of Jupiter, the ftgnificator of
his wife, who is pofited in the 4th, his own Houfe,
ftrong, and in trine afpeA to the Sun : the Dra-
gon’s-head, or Moon’s fortunate node, falls in his
wife s 2d ; all which ftrongly predict the querent’s
wife would not lofe her inheritance. 7'his telli-
mony is corroborated by the pofition of Jupiter,
who is Lord of Pifees, or his wife’s Houfe, and
alfo his wife’s lOth fignificator of the mother, viz.
the 4th Houfe in the figure, and loth from the
7th. This indicated much love between mother
and daughter. Sic,
The querent’s fignificator being in his fall la
Pifees, a w'atery fign, and in conjunction with
Venus, (hews him to be a man of a difilpated turn j
as is alfo denoted by quartile of Jupiter and Mer-
cury.
The fituation of the Sun and Dragon’s-head'ln
his wife’s 2d, or my querent’s 8th, fignify he has
received a legacy before through his wife’s rela-
tions, or father ;
which he foon confefled ;
but that
it is fquandered away, appears by Dragon’s- tail in
his 2d Houfe, in conjunction with the part of
J'ortiine. Now, taking all the afpects together,
I hclitated not to declare, nottvithflanding all his
C 174 ]
bad behaviour, he would receive the legacy pro-
mifed, not out of any regard to him, but out of
refpefl to the daughter, who appears to love his
wife moft affedfionUtely.
Thus, I hope, I have given fufficient Exam-
ples of the Truth and Utility of this Science, in
theQueftionary wayj Ifhall therefore onlyobferve,
that horary queftions had better not be made ufe of,
if the querent’s Nativity can be had * j as more
certainty depends upon the one than upon the
other, and will afford the perfon who bends his
* mind to the knowledge of futurity greater fatif-
fadion.

APPENDIX.
"W^E would beg the reader to obferve, that the
figures already inferted include all that is required
for the purpofe of judging horary queftions, &c,
but in nativities, regard muft be had to the Fixed
Stars**, which will be publiflied in a Complete Doc-
trine of Nativities ;
for the afpe£ls of the planets
conftitute the principal index of our judgement in
queftion: we fliall therefore proceed to the Planet-
ary Hours, the knowledge of which is of great
ufe in gathering herbs for the cure of difeafes, to
know the Lord of the Houfe, to determine various
points, and perform many natural conclufions,
&c. &C.
Of the Planetary Hours, and how to find them either
Day or Night,
For the finding of the planetary hours you muft
underftand that every artificial day, viz. from
Sun-
* That Is, for thofc who are curious ;
elfe the Seven Planets
Indicate all that is pall, prefent, and to come.
C 176 J
S»n-rifing to Sun-fetting, is divided into twelve
equal parts j each of thefe parts is called a planet-
ary hour*. Alfo the night, viz. from Sun-fetting
to Sun-rifing, is divided into twelve parts,
making the Planetary hours for the night. For
example : when the days are 14 hours 40 min,
long, then the length of the Planetary hour for
the day is 90 min. and for the night but 30 min.
But for more readinefs, behold the following ta-
ble, calculated for the latitude 52, but may indif-
ferently ferve any part of England without fenfible
error.
Since this Edition went to prefs, I learn that Planetary
Hours ate not looked npon in that important light they ufeJ to
be, .rnd are totally difregarded by the Eaftern nations at this time,
and alfo by the Italians. The Brami-ns in India arc fuch adepts in
this Science, that they will tell every occurrence of a perfon’s life
by the bare infpeftlon of their nativity, diredlly. The Italians,
alfo, are very ingenious, and will acquaint a perfon diretlly of the
principal things contained in it. Notwithilanding, thofe that ftudy
the Planetary Hours, will find a great degree of pleafurc and
fetirfadiou in them.

The Explanation and Ufe of the Talk of Planetary
Hours,
In the firfl: column, on the left-hand page, you
have the place of the Sun to every fix 'degrees
through the Twelve Signs: under that you find
nr and ; and under Aries you find o, 6, 12, 18,
24; and under Virgo you find 30, 24, 18, 12, 6
:
by which you fee that the Sun rifeth at the fame
hour when he is in 6 deg. of Aries, as he doth
when he is in 24 deg. of Virgo. The Planetary
Hours are noted at the top of the Table, i, 2, 3,
4, &c. both before^Noon and after Noon, In the
fecond column you have the firfl: planetary hour
after Sun-rife: as, when Sol is in 6 degrets of
Cancer, or 24 deg. of Leo, you fhall find the firfl:
planetary hour continues from Snn-rife, till 16
min. after five. The fecond planetary hour con-
tinues till 37 minutes after 6, &c.
In the firfl: column, on the left-hand, you have
the hour and minute of Sun-rifing to every fix
degrees of the Twelve Signs. The refl of the
columns fhew the planetary hours for the Night,
as the Table directs you. Then, when you find
the planetary hour, you may know what planet
governs the hour by the following Table.

Noon; and in the fecond column for the After-

1. TheQueftion is radical, and fit to be judged’,,
when the Lord of the Afcendant and Lord of the
Houfe be of one nature and triplicity.
2. Have moft regard to the dignity or debility
of the D ;
it Is far better the Lord of the Afcendant
be unfortunate than (he, as ftie brings us all the
virtue of the other planets, and of one planet to>
another.. Cardan.
3. In every Queftion when the Fortunes are-
fignificators, hope If Infortunes, fear the
vrorft,.
4. See from- what planet the D is feparated ;
that
planet Ihews what is paft, or has been done ;
if.
from a Fortune, good ;
if from an evil planet, bad,
according to the nature of. the houfe..
5. The

condition of the thing defired, viz. her applying
by a good afpedf, and in a good houfe, to a good
planet, intimates the ftrong hopes of the Qiieftion
intended ; fo that from the conjun 61 ion and fepa-
ration of the planets, things part, prefent, and to.

6. Always confider the if well dignified in-
