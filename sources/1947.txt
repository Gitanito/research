  Only one issue is known, which is probably the only issued.  The Metropolitan Society of Occult Philosophers is the same as the Society of the Mercurii, first mentioned by Smith in the Straggling Astrologer the preceding August. The members almost certainly included the artist John Varley (1778-1842), a friend of William Blake, to whom is attributed the anonymous nativity of "William Blake, the Mystical Artist," in the  surviving issue of this journal. The Introductory Address for the journal stressed that it was written to "attract the attention of those who are believers in the doctrines of siderial and occult influence, and to none others," and "in order to keep our work as select as possible, we have have adopted the most likely method of doing so, by making the price far above the common run of the periodicals which glut the literature of the present day.  We have funds at our command . . . ."  This ploy seems to have been misdirected and certainly did not succeed.  The journal contained nativities, extracts from "celebrated authors," digressions on Noah and the Ark and the symbols of the dragon’s head and tail, articles on proper computing  of an arc of direction in horoscopes, discussions of coincidences, predictions for the coming year, discussions of the casting of lots, etc.  Listed in F. Leigh Gardner, Bibliotheca Astroligica, 121.  BL; Oxford University.
