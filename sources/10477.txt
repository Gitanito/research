  		              		Experience Description   

    When I had my NDE, I did not remember what had happened until much later after I woke up. Physically I passed out and my pulse stopped. My boyfriend, at the time, found me on the floor of his house after coming home. Because he was a firefighter, he started giving me lifesaving care and then I was brought to a hospital. After waking in a hospital hours later, I have never felt more alone or depressed thinking, 'Here we go again. When will this ever stop?'

  Days or weeks later during meditation, I felt like I experienced a tremendous download and I remembered what happened clearly. I remember being under what seemed like a street lamp emitting this tremendous energy except it was different than light. It was so shiny but  not bright; it is hard to explain. Then it felt as if time stopped. This was a relief because to me because I always viewed time as  my enemy.   I realized at that moment, Mondays and bills would no longer come.  Everything just stopped and I was in the driver’s seat. Then instead of everything disintegrating with time, everything just started to regenerate,  get new life, and get more beautiful -  it just took my breathe away. I remember laughing at myself for taking everything so seriously.  I realized that I chose to come here to earth, but instead of making it a good place  to come and learn, I made it into a Hell. I then felt that a shift was happening. It felt like I had somewhat of a new perspective, and everything was one. I felt like all Beings, both physical and non-physical, were all present except that the physical Being didn’t know it.

  At that moment, I realized that if I  didn’t come back, my daughter's path would be more difficult.  I couldn’t accept that her life would be more difficult because of my passing. I could have stayed and really would have because it felt like bliss.   So, I chose to come back for her sake.  I also felt like I had unfinished business.   I started freaking out and started thinking negatively again but then saw that the light was absorbing the negative energy.  The light was letting me know everything  would be o.k., that it was always o.k., and  that it’s my life.  This  is just the waiting room for something better that I chose to come to, to either visit or learn or prepare for the next level. I'm not sure which. 
  
  Ever since this experience happened, I felt like an alien.  It is  like I know there are certain secrets and I want everyone else to know.  Yet,  I don’t know how to get them to feel it or understand it. I want everyone to know this, to know that  we are eternal and part of the source energy. Also, since this experience, I started being pulled to spiritual things and researching it. I found people on YouTube such as Abraham Hicks. I started meditating right afterwards, which I never did before. 
  
  I explain it in my Facebook video post which is only 15 min long
