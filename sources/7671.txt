  		              		Experience Description   

    In the first NDE, I found myself suddenly walking down a beautiful path. Everywhere, the colors seemed alive with a brilliance that I can't possibly describe. I was alone on the path and a bit disoriented  trying to figure out where I was. Then a a Being approached me and said 'What are you doing here?' I replied, 'I don't know.' The Being said, 'You're not supposed to be here yet. You'd better come with me.' The Being was very concerned as it took me to a Being of authority. The authority  kneeled down to my eye level and held me as it  said, 'You are not supposed to be here yet. You will come back again, but you cannot stay here now. You must breath, and you must and wake up. Now.'  I woke up feeling like I was in a totally foreign place with strange creatures.  The children around me were playing the pass out game. I wanted to go back to the tremendous love I felt in the beautiful, color-filled place.  I have never forgotten that experience.
  
  The second NDE was recently when I was under anesthesia. This time the Beings were expecting me. It was like a grand reunion. I was in the same color and light-filled place as before. I felt as though I was there for a week of time while bathing in love, affection, and color. There was a calm feeling of understanding everything as universal knowledge.  It made the things of this world seem so cumbersome. Then it was time for me to return to my body.  All of the Beings impressed upon me their love and support for my journey back; and all of the things I am to do before returning home again to that place at some point in the future. I understood that I needed to come back here and I understood that I would go back there again (home) when the time comes. I felt totally bathed in love. When I woke up, I was the happiest I have EVER been in my life! The feeling stays with me and I know it will never fade. 

The only way I can describe the 'coming back' process is if you can imagine having your soul, spirit, or essence, stuffed into a goldfish's body, and then dropped into a fish bowl. I know that sounds a little nuts, but it's the closest analogy I can come up with.      					  


Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 1969 & 2019  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes         The first time, we were playing the pass out game as children. I was only nine, and the teenager who constricted my breathing was very large.  The second time, I was under propofol anesthesia.  Life threatening event, but not clinical death.   
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  In the first NDE, while I was still at the other place, I could hear the children in this world expressing their frantic fear that I had died.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         I'm not sure I understand this question.   

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning   

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, and the facts have been checked out  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain     A 'portal?' and 'path' in the first NDE, a 'portal?'  in the second NDE.  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I actually saw them  

  Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes     They were not related to me in the sense that we think about it here. All is relational, so there were many Beings I have and did interact with.  

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

  Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   Living light, in living color  everywhere.  

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     That place was my home of origin. Once you feel that kind of home, this world seems foreign and temporary.  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Pure love.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe       

  Did scenes from your past come back to you?         I remembered many past events, especially the knowledge of the first NDE, that I had been there before, originally, and then accidentally when I was nine.  

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Other or several faiths   Because of my first NDE, I have been on a quest for knowledge all of my life, having studied science, religion, philosophy, etc. I now refer to myself as a Synechism Scholar. This most recent NDE has confirmed for me that I have been on the right path, and will continue to apply it to my future work with my podcast, blog, and eventual travels for teaching anyone willing to learn.  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     Navigated to an understanding of Synechism.  

What is your religion now?         Other or several faiths   Synechism Scholar  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     In the first NDE, I had little knowledge. But it was because I had had a previous NDE that I was completely knowledgeable after the second NDE.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Uncertain     

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         Uncertain     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes       

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes     

  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     The only way I can describe it is to say that this world is like a halfway house for Beings. The  cultivation of love and the culling of the love that can be produced here seems like a goal of sorts. The love is pure there, whereas it is contaminated here. But it can be cultivated. This is the garden, and we need to be better gardeners.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists            

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     There is a thought virus that I speak about in my podcast; Nominalism/Ontological Individualism. It has contaminated the garden. It will take a huge effort to reinvigorate the garden by those who understand.  

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes       

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life       

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I believe this has affected me for most of my life. I see this world differently than most.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes     

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience   This is not an easy question for me to answer. Also, some questions re difficult for me to answer because 'God' is not as most people define.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     Awareness of synechism. Events and foreknowledge are common in my life, and have been since my first NDE.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          All of it.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Only a couple of people very close to me. Time lines were different for each event. They seemed fascinated.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Uncertain   Which NDE? The first one 'no'. The second one 'yes', of course! :)  

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real       

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real       

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes
