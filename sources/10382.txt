  		              		Experience Description   

    I was admitted to the hospital with  bilateral pneumonia and acute kidney failure. I was in an isolated room that was not monitored in the emergency department. I was waiting for a bed on the floor. The  call bell  did not work. I was on 100% oxygen with a respiratory rate of 28-35 and HR of 125-145 BPM. I had been to a variety of tests during the day and when I returned I was not monitored for the night. I started to have hypoxic hallucinations when I was sleeping and I would wake up and watch bunnies chasing chipmunks all over the room. I tried calling the nurse to get help but again, the call bell wouldn't work. I would drift off back to sleep and leave my body.  I would be standing beside the stretcher. I knew that I was very close to death when I came back into my body and I attempted to get the nurse again but couldn't.
  
  I saw the white tunnel and went through it very quickly. I exited into white light and saw a variety of Beings off to the left-hand side. I told them I was not going to stop,  that I was going  further on. I  turned to my right and found myself in utter blackness. I was very calm and remarked to myself, 'I guess I am dead.' I thought that I should tell someone that I was dead and headed to the nurses station to ask them to look in  room 16. I saw everyone who was on duty and told them. Then I realized that that was silly because I wasn't in a body. I was a light orb. Upon realizing this, I returned to the Void. I then thought about who I should tell and I thought of my Mother who was wintering in Harlingen, Texas. As soon as I thought this, I saw a window appear before me with a man and woman sleeping on a bed. I entered the window and stared down at them. There was no emotion and I didn't feel any attachment to them.  I said to the woman, ' Well, I just thought that I should tell you that I have died and I will be going on.' Then I went back through the window into the Void.
    
    Back in the Void I wondered what to do next. I wanted to make sure that this really was the void. I went to the left and then to the right. Then I went  up farther, but everywhere I went I was just there. There was no way to reference where I was. I could only see darkness in 360 degrees. As I looked into the darkness I had a feeling that I was glowing but I couldn't be sure. As I looked into the blackness, I would catch glimpses of a blue grid but the blue was so dark that it seemed to blend in with the blackness. I thought of all the places I could go and all the things I could do. As I thought, they appeared before me in little windows or television screens that were almost holographic. The images moved and had life to them.

    I started to think of everything I knew about the void and that it was all things potentially, but nothing materially. As I thought that the view exploded around me with little windows in 360 degrees into infinity. I was overwhelmed, so I thought that I would not make a decision right then but wait here until I could make a choice.

    I then started to wonder who I was. Was I secondary consciousness (self) or my primary consciousness (my Higher Self). As I asked a question, I heard a voice by my right side. This was roughly where my right ear would be if I had a body. It said, 'Who do you want to be?'

    I stepped forward and said immediately. 'I will always be a student of Ramtha the Enlightened One.' As I said that, I noticed that the windows decreased in number from all around me.

    I wondered if anyone had found my body and if I was ready to move on to another place. I looked back down to my body. As I did so, I saw my friends and family having to deal with my house and property; and the stress of doing this on them. I knew that I had responsibilities to go back and deal with things that were unfinished. I didn't want to go back but I took a big sigh and said, 'Okay I will go back.'  I woke up in my body. I was in rough shape and my condition had worsened considerably. But this time, the call-bell worked and I was able to get the nurse to come. I ended up being transferred to the intensive care unit.  I stayed there for 10 days on a breathing machine.                

    Background Information:         

    Gender:   	Female    

    Date NDE Occurred:   	 March 19, 2016    

    NDE Elements:         

    At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes   Illness        Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function).     I was very ill with pneumonia and had very low oxygen saturation. I was not monitored or  checked for 3 hours.    

    How do you consider the content of your experience?        Neither pleasant NOR distressing    

    Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  I watched the nurses in the nursing station go about their business and saw the patients in the hall, even though I had no knowledge before hand who was working and I saw a trauma come in.    I clearly left my body and existed outside it    

    How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   Mentally, my thought was clearer and I was very logical and analytical. I felt no emotion only a sense of curiosity.    

    At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         I maintained an extreme state of alertness throughout the experience.    

    Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast    

    Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.    I felt like I was in the void for about 15 minutes  because I had so much happen while I was there. I don't know how long I was gone but it could have been minutes up to 3 hours here.    

    Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual    

    Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       The colors and definition of the images were remarkable. I wear glasses in this reality but there the most minute details were distinct. I could see clearly in my mother's dark bedroom without any problem.    

    Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      Due to being in the void, there was very little sound but the voice that spoke above my right ear was quite matter of fact and normal tone.    

    Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, and the facts have been checked out    

    Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     I passed out of my body into a tunnel of light that was the size of a doorway. There were levels to it like rings or circles and I knew that I could stop at a level and it would open up to something else but I was focused on going to the Void so I didn't stop just rushed through.    

    Did you see any beings in your experience?         No    

    Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes     I did not recognize the beings in the light.    

    Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         An unusually bright light    

    Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   The tunnel was blinding white light.    

    Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         No         

    What emotions did you feel during the experience?         I was very unemotional and detached. I regretted having to come back.    

    Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness    

    Did you have a feeling of joy?         No    

    Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world    

    Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe.     I would ask for information and it would appear before me or the knowledge would come to me instantly. I seemed to remember information in perfect detail as soon as I asked a question.    

    Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No         

    Did scenes from the future come to you?         Scenes from my personal future     I saw my family in the future.    

    Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life.   I was shown the future if I didn't go back. Based on that information, I chose to return with the condition that I had no neurological damage from my death.    

    God, Spiritual and Religion:         

    What was your religion prior to your experience?      Other or several faiths   very spiritual but not affiliated with any organized religion.    

    Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I am more dedicated to my spiritual practice than I was before.    

    What is your religion now?         Other or several faiths   very spiritual but not affiliated with any organized religion.    

    Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I had some previous knowledge of the Void through the Ramtha School of Enlightenment but I did not take that knowledge for granted. I tested out to make sure that I was in a true experience and not fooling myself. I acted like a scientist and tested what I knew.    

    Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         No         

    Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I heard a voice I could not identify   I saw a couple of beings in the light and spoke to them and told them I was continuing on. While in the void I heard a voice ask me who I wanted to be.    

    Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No    

    Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No       

    During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No         

    During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     Everything came out of the void and we are all connected through the void. There is no separation.    

    During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I figured that the voice in my head that asked me who I wanted to be was my God.    

    Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:         

    During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No       

    During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No         

    During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     There is life after death and I got  to choose what I want to do. The choice is unlimited although one of the choices I thought of, I wasn't ready yet to experience so that option was discouraged.    

    Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     Everything is a choice. There is no good/bad, right/wrong it is just experience and choice. The greatest gift we have is our ability to make choice.    

    During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No         

    During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     There is no judgment, there is only love. Whatever choice I made, I was loved and connected.    

    What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     I am very focused now on service to others. I feel it is my responsibility to share the wisdom I have learned.    

    Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I have lost people out of my life, including a best friend.    

    After the NDE:         

    Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   I went over the experience many times in my head. It was such an intense experience that it was very personal to me and I didn't tell my doctors or family and friends until later.    

    How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I experienced  some of my remembrances have softened over time but when I recall being in the Void it is as real as it was 2 years ago.    

    Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     My healing work has increased tremendously. I am highly telepathic and I can now see with my eyes closed and blinders on.    

    Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          I recall how expanded my mind was when all the possibilities extended around me into infinity in all directions. I also am very partial to the feeling that I was glowing    

    Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I shared my experience partially with my mother 4 days after and others since. They found my experiences fascinating and asked questions that caused me to analyze the experience differently. They helped me clarify things that I hadn't consciously thought about.    

    Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   It has been an interest since I read Raymond Moody's work as a teenager.    

    What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I tested the validity of the experience while I was in it and it was confirmed by my Mother who said that I had appeared to her in a dream and told her I had died.    

    What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real         

    At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Uncertain   Through the Ramtha School of Enlightenment I have had experiences of the void before but not with this kind of clarity and vividness.    

    Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I did wonder if I should heal myself while I was in the void.  I couldn't explain it to the doctors so I didn't choose to. Also, I had choices to be anything I wanted to be and manifest anything into this reality but I didn't because in the void there is no lack.    

    Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         You could ask more questions about previous knowledge of other realities, previous OBE experiences and practices such as meditation.
