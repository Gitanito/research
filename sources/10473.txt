  		    Experience Description 9032 (Submitted 7/18/2020):   

      I was calm and without any pain. I knew I was dying and it did not seem to be of any importance to me. As I was preparing to leave my body, my life was 'rolled out' for me to view.  I was disappointed at how little I had accomplished. Then I became aware of a presence who said telepathically, 'You have done enough; you can come over.'   I became aware of a feeling of comfort, calm and a beautiful peace within a soft yellow/gold backdrop. I had no feeling for any of my children, family or friends because I realized how short in Cosmic terms that Life is and that we would all be together in a moment. As we discussed my Life, I felt  guilt that I had not provided security for my Wife and could not leave her without addressing her future security.   I told 'God' that I had to return even if I had now fulfilled whatever it was I was meant to have done.  I had the insight that we are all here to allow souls to experience 'life,' however painful or rewarding, bland or stunning the soul's existence. The existence was so perfect as to be meaningless without feeling Life through others. I now knew what peace really is.   I was told that I could  go back and fulfill my job, cause or mission. However, I would be returning back to the souls at some point in the future and without warning.

   My heart rate came down slowly. My sight returned three days later.  I was taught to walk and talk again over several months.  My brain seems to have 'rewired' itself as my wife reminds me that I am not the same person because I  am no longer funny and am reclusive. I am  now self-contained; neither happy or sad, just balanced and very much better at understanding complex concepts in any field. As I am semi-retired, this ability seems to serve no purpose. I am fulfilling my commitments, have some lasting physical damage, but nothing seems to bother me anymore.

  Thank you for letting me write my story. This is the second time I have had an NDE, the first one at nine years old as told below.  This may account for how this experience unfolded.  I do not have, and I doubt there exists, any vocabulary that can describe the feelings, the 'Presence,' or the place. This note is crude compared to the reality of passing over. I felt a profound sense of loss for leaving the 'place' and having to return to this life. This feeling  is with me all day and every day.  I will fulfill my bargain and when it is my 'time' again I will pass over.  At that time, I will willingly stay.

          Experience Description 7098 (Submitted 1/31/2014):   

  I saw a light and started to walk towards it, I became aware I was in, what felt like a very large ‘tunnel’ and I was moving up an incline within it. At an undetermined point within the ‘tunnel’, I stopped.  I heard inside my head a voice that was neither male nor female.  The voice sounded soft and kind said, ‘Hello Nigel don’t be afraid you have had an accident, it is not your time, you have to go back.’ I said I did not want to, as it hurt too much and I wanted to stay here.  We were almost involved in an argument. The voice told me I had no choice in the matter and I was going back as I had ‘things to do’. I presume I heard in the form of language I used at the time as a nine-year-old boy.

I came to, in great pain as I started to grab small breaths, then I could breathe normally.  It felt liked my lungs popped open. Luckily nothing was broken, my right arm felt dead because of the fall. I walked up to the house, told my Mother I fell out a tree and  I was alright, went upstairs and cleaned up, had my tea and never said a word to her about this experience.

Uncertain   Uncertain I seemed to grow up a little distant and very self-contained; I want few people around me: yet everyone wants to be part of me!

After the NDE:     

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      Yes   I, until now, have never written or tried to express this situation to a third party, I told my wife twenty years into our relationship, when the subject came up on a TV program. The light, the feeling of comfort and a sense of joy, the whole ‘place’ was unlike anything I have ever encountered; sadly my command of English will never do justice to the experience.

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       I would wish that everyone could have the experience without the pain, maybe they would take more care of each other whilst they are here, and save a shed load of money and life fighting wars which will never matter, building companies that have little point and creating a society that has many meaningless values. I am not a Hippy, but from my eyes, it is plain stupid! Here only matter's whilst you are here! Enjoy a life, why make it hard work when there is no need. I think if Hell were described without religion or fear it is right here, right now.
