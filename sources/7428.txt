I felt a presence over me and near my face. It felt like something was sucking the air out of my lungs and my own breath was cold when it came out of my body and my lips became very cold. I sat up because I couldn't breathe. I opened my back door to get air and when I looked outside there was this beautiful blue-white light coming from the sky. I could see very far as if a nuclear bomb had went off outside. It was 3:30 am and I could see for miles it seemed. I couldn't hear anything and it was so peaceful. I wasn't afraid. Which surprises me. A picture of my daughters flashed in my mind I guess. My oldest was first and then my youngest. I said the words, 'GOD I am not ready.' The light slowly started to return to the sky and my body took a deep breath. The paramedics arrived a few moments later and my BP was 226/182. After this my body and mind were so tired. I felt drained of all my energy.
