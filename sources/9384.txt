  		              		Experience Description   

    The accident itself was portrayed in that old TV show Rescue 911. 

  My vision flickered when it went into tunnel vision twice, real quick. Then I went unconscious. 

  I found myself suspended on my back with my arms and legs crossed as if I were lying in a coffin. Then a wave of bright, white light came over me. It was a bright light.  I could still feel discomfort and I was clammy. Then another brilliant white light came over me and everything was released. I was in a state of suspended animation and  bliss.Then a brilliant, white hand came over my body.  I felt the hand masculine. I was amazed at how bright, calm and euphoric I felt. I marveled  at how clear the fingerprint lines were at the bottom of the hand's fingers to the palms. Before I could ask a why everything worked the way it did, it was answered.  I remember the answer was so simple. Then I heard a voice through my body say, 'You're all right, I like you.' The hand was lifted and the first bright light was back.

  Then I could feel pain again and I was in the arms of a deputy Sheriff calling my name.

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     I was wondering if it really happened.

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         With my PTSD and my NDE, I feel that I can help other people or a book can be made about my experiences that can help other people cope, accept and confirm that this life is not the end.
