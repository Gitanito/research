  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  It was summer in Long Island, New York at Stone Brook beach. My older brother challenged me to swim over to an island maybe thirty feet away. I made it across and was so tired. My brother told me the water was rising and I panicked. I started to swim back and about half way could not swim any more. I went down three times, last thing I saw was the life guard on shore. Next thing I knew it was pitch black, no feeling of the body, floating and great, joy can't explain the joy. I looked up and saw a white light far away but I was moving towards, then it turned slowly pitch black all around me. I finally woke up on the beach with the paramedics. I got up and ran all the way home.
