  		              		Experience Description   

  In 2012, I was celebrating on getting a new job. I was out with friends and I had consumed way too much alcohol. I had an altercation with door staff of a nightclub. The security staff had to restrain me and used body pressure on my chest. 

  I remember a lot of shouting going on but then something amazing happened. I saw a bright light and felt so much love flowing through me. I felt at peace and my thoughts of my love for my children flowed through my body. I was no longer intoxicated. I just felt at peace while I was somewhere I can't explain. 

  After a while, I came back around and awoke sitting up. I believe God gave me a chance to sort my life out and let me return to my life. But I have to say, I'm not afraid to meet the lord because the experience I had was heavenly. I hope my experience will give even one person a chance to turn to our lord and pray to him.
