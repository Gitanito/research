I looked down the side of the path and could see the tops of very tall trees way down below me. I came to an enormous hand carved wooden door that went up as far as I could see. I heard a man's voice tell me I could go through the door if I wanted to and I would see my father. I told him that I could not go through because my mother would be left alone.
