  		              		Experience Description   

    I was admitted at the emergency room with suspected heart problems.  After a few hours of intensive care, I was rolled to the corridor of a ward because they didn't have enought beds. 

That first night, I had an experience.  I was fully conscious.  I wasn't under hallucinagenic drugs, had no shortness of breath, and I didn't go into cardiac arrest.  I did, however, have an intense fear of dying.   

Suddenly, I was in darkness. I was more conscious and alert than I had ever been.  I asked, 'Am I dead now?' I was looking around and aware that I still had a body, but it wasn't my earthly body. It was very dark and I didn't know where to go. I was alone.

  Then I saw a tunnel with a bright white light. I wanted to go over there but my grandmother, strongly pushed me away. I could not get close to the tunnel.

  I kept looking around and saw another tunnel with a bright white light. So, I wanted to go over there.

  But this time, an unknown person kept me away from the tunnel.  Two rejections scared me.

  Then suddenly, I was in a beautiful violet, magenta-colored light. A few Beings surrounded me and I felt so very much loved. They were very loving souls.

  Then I saw my whole life; every microsecond, every thought, and every feeling. The Beings escorted me through my complete life. It was like a life review. I could ask everything and got answers that were healing to my soul. There was no sense of time and space. 

  There was a feeling of everything, a void, and being everywhere, exactly the way I had experienced when I practised Yoga and had done color meditations on earth. 

  I was able to communicate with all beings at once and could understand the answers clearly. A lot of information had been pouring into me. I got answers about a person who was still alive.  This was confirmed as accurate after I came back to my body.  There was no fear anymore. I felt mutual respect, much love and humbleness. Each of those Beings listened and answered to me. There was no 'you have to' or sense of   power over me. The communication happened at the same eye level.

  Then another Being came forward with deep humbleness and much love and said to me, “It's ok the way it happens.” This person repeated this sentence three times. This sentence remains vivid in my memory.

  I later named this Being 'God,' due to the lack of the right term.  I returned suddenly and conscious in my bed. I felt fine like I had been healed. I didn't feel bad and very weak.

  On the following day the doctors could only diagnose an overreaction of the immune system.

  This experience has been so profound that I'm still thinking about for almost every day.
