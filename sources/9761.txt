  		              		Experience Description   

    On August 23, 1985, I arrived home from work. I walked to the back yard after I had changed into shorts and a tee shirt.  I was not wearing  shoes.
  
  I went out to pick an apple from a little tree behind the pool. Unknowingly,   I had stepped on a yellow jacket nest under the tree. I was stung many times and knew that  I was  allergic to wasp stings.  I needed to call the hospital as soon as possible to let them know I was coming. I had been advised I should immediately go to hospital if bitten or stung so I could be monitored. 
  
  This sting one felt more like a little electric shock and not as painful as other stings I had gotten before.   I walked back to the house to advise Jimmy that I needed to go to the hospital. He knew I was allergic and had gone with me to the hospital before.  
  
  Because it had felt so minor, I was not really concerned as I went up the stairs to wash my bare feet and change to slacks, rather than wearing the old shorts to the hospital.

  By the time I reached the top of the stairs, I knew something was not right.  I had just  removed my shorts and started to put my legs in the jeans. I could not pull them up.  I  tried to call Jimmy for help but very little sound was coming from my mouth. Later, he said that my eyes were rolled back into my head.   Even though I was lifeless, I knew what he was doing and what was happening around us.
  
  He 'shook' me down into the jeans and dragged me to the garage.  He  put me in the passenger seat. He drove with one hand as the other hand held my head forward. He held  my hair at the back of my head so the vomit could roll out rather than choke me.
  
  We lived very close to the hospital.  I was concentrating hard  trying to breathe, but it felt like I was frozen and could not make my body do anything it should. I couldn't control my body.  I couldn't breathe, or  control my bowels or urine.  Yet, despite all this, I heard all the talking and observations that were being made around me.
  
  The hospital staff were waiting for me and met the car at the entrance to emergency room.  I heard them say that my lips and the ends of my fingers were blue.   In the emergency room there was a lot of activity but I had stopped fighting to breathe and was feeling quite relaxed. I was thinking  of my Mum and Dad.   Three months earlier, to the day, my brother had been killed in a car crash and I felt that losing another child would be just too much for them.  I was trying to tell the medical people to try hard to save me because I was worried about Mum and Dad. But I don’t think I was getting any words out.  I wasn’t thinking of my children or my husband, I knew they would be fine.
  
  While I lay there, I felt very calm and could see white light up ahead, not too far away.  I felt that my recently deceased was very close to me. I was feeling quite torn that I needed to stay for Mum and Dad, but yet, I was looking forward to seeing my brother.  I felt like it was  a shame that I could not keep going toward the light because it was so peaceful, but I felt I should try to stay too.
  
  I also thought that I could see all the medical people from an outside view, not from where my body was.  While they seemed frantic, I felt very calm and peaceful.  Then I started to come out of wherever I was and into the center of a group of medical people.  I looked down at my feet and could see a rash coming out on the top of my foot.  It was in the shape of a heart.
  
  They said that the rash did not usually happen at the end of the episode and they were quite interested in my comments about my feeling of being 'frozen.' 
  
  The experience left me with  a feeling of calm. I know that when I do die,  it is not going to be a bad experience and that there will be somewhere else to go to.
