What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Unknown     All my life, I have believed. But I have felt embarrassed by the discussion of 'doubt' and 'faith' going together. To me it is no question. Reverence and connection, and something straight-forward is my way of living. When I was a child, there was always this fuzz about taking the communion whenever we were in church (it was the 70's in Denmark). I just did it. And placed myself as far away of my parents if they chose to go up there too. By believe has always been something private. I see myself as Christian, but my experiences go far beyond the established church. When I finally had no way out, but to admit this is the foundation of my being, it cost me floods of tears along with the relieve. I recognized myself the best in out-of-the-closet-homosexual-stories. I let people respond to my sharing of my experience with: 'could it not have been the light just breaking the surface of the water, you saw?' And I said - 'whatever it was, it was the most beautiful thing, I have ever experienced'. Like holding a door for their earthly explanation. I was not until I started reading about other NDE's late 2018, after my second NDE, which happened in September  2017 that I realized, I have had and lived with all the aftereffects, and they have just been broadened out throughout my life: I have never been afraid of dying (which was at one point a cause for sorrow, since one of my friends said, he had seen a psychologist because of his hypochondria and fright of dying, and she had answered him: 'It is because you love life that much', and I was so sad, because I did not love life, I actually had a hard time getting the point of life). For this I want to say, that the answer for 46b could have for the most of my life have been that life is not meaningful and significant, but after my second NDE, I know I am here for a reason. My psychic sensitivity has always been extraordinary, during my late twenties to an extend where I had to pray and ask the inner realms to turn down a bit to be able to live, and I walked so many miles to understand, meet and rescue other people. I has been natural to me, however 'I' was so unimportant, that people have commented on it, since I have not had bad self-esteem. No interest in completing, a very rich inner life, I could withdraw to, not judgmental, feeling the beast while connected to nature.  But I believe, that the abrupt ending of my experience and the totally non-aware-of-aftereffects has left me quite lonely amongst all these beautiful people I have always known and shared love with. So many have come to me in crises situation, and leaned on me while I trouble, so much death has crossed my way in so many forms. I have been loved by people, and from within I have definitely felt, I was loved, but I have also been abused. I have given myself away to an extend where I have been taken for granted and in both intimate relationships and business been fucked with. I have taken coaching education and heart-healer education and spiritual therapist education to get paper and techniques to what I knew and did beforehand, but that way I slowly learned how to protect myself.  There was - when I was not in nature and not silent and just alone - a veil between 'me' and 'me'. An inability to wish and dream and realize/manifest my dreams for myself. I could get inspired and lifted and heading for, and suddenly it just dropped out of my hands and head. The only thing, that I knew I could do better than anybody was to go deep into those fine, delicate, subtle and profound layers of relationships and people, that is repressed, but contain so much harm, but also the key to relieve and inner strength and stamina building. But I was never able to make a business on it. I wanted to give myself to other people's project, and I did not succeed with that either. Economically. They did.  And then in my second NDE, I came out knowing, I had put that un-immediateness behind me. That veil between me and me. And I felt peeled and cleansed, and I knew I was good, and I had realized my overwhelming powers in there, and I had set limits for how far anybody could invade me. And I met a polar bear and knew, I am protected. So, it is like - I went there for the second time to get, what we humans have to have to survive, and to give each other genuine respect. It is NOT respectful to let somebody else run away with your powers! How are they supposed to handle that? They have more than enough dealing with their own being.  I also want to tell, that during my teenage years, I developed depression. Until 30, I had three of them. And at a point, I went to a healer, since I had difficulties living on. I had had these sorrow-outbursts as long as I lived. My mother says it came after the drowning-episode. I was inconsolable, and the water inside just ran and ran; unstoppable until I lay down, slept and disappeared into this lonely, comforting, beautiful place for a long, long time. At the end, I went to see a healer. He asked me to describe my life backwards. And when I stopped at 8-9 of age, he said: 'you tell about grieve and sorrow, grieve and sorrow in one, long row. You have to go further back: What happened when you were 4 1/2-5 years old?' I lit up of course, and said: 'That I can easily tell you, I was almost drowning, and it was so beautiful.......', where to he responded: 'That is it. Your soul. wanted to go, leaving your body behind. That is usually stock in the hips (I had severe pelvis disabilities during and after pregnancy). And the moment he said that, it was like a zipper, zipping me together from down to top. And immediately, I knew, I would get no more depressions, and from that day on, the tendency to see myself from outside diminished remarkably. I had since my early schooldays always this outer view of myself from left side, behind and up: I could always see myself in the middle of the ring with my classmates, hear our talking, but from above.  And I have seen colors. It lasted many years, and I was a grown woman when I understood that other people do not see the same as me when they see each other. And I did not pursue what the colors meant, but suddenly it occurred to me, that they tell me, where people are seeking from: Colors follow chair-colors. Mind-people get bluish, sense-people yellow and heart grounded people get green around their heads when they speak. And people in love are pink. Once I saw wings on a person. I was told by this pushing pulse from inside to tell him to trust his intuition whenever in doubt. This is embarrassing of course, but I always know when to speak, and it always is right. It is like channeling. I just also had to learn, that no matter how much they want something from the inner realms, how much they push us to reveal or deal with something, it is us who are here. We know how much effort it takes, and we are allowed to say no. I have also interchanges with parallel worlds. The knowing what to say can be the shared energy in the room calling for it, as if 120 to 200 people are thinking the same, and I just speak it first. But the meetings with masters, elves or angels are real: they always leave something behind, something to be aware of or understand. Or simply love for me in hard times.  I relate all of this to my acceptance of my early experience. I have tried to tell my life from a psycho-social perspective, but I have heard my self-claim the point the latest years, that there is so much more. I cannot and will not be reduced to social and biological reasons, even though I can see, they also have influence, however in a much larger scale as to 'mum & dad': There are features for generations too. I have one thing more, I have struggled: Politics do not interest me at all. Power fights, dirty tricks, newspapers and other media - that is not for me! Many friends have been reluctant to this treat of mine, but they have come to the conclusion that they cannot change me.  I also want to say, I have many abilities with my hands, and my mother wants to put me in a 'creative' box. But for me, they are mere necessities, and I believe them to be trainings from former lives. My own perception of my creativity is how I approach what seems to be existential, Gordian knots or conflicts in a person, in a workplace or in a family. That is my interest and gift. But even if I have done that many times, also for payment, what I can do has not gained me my living. I suppose it has to do with the veil. the un-immediateness. People get insecure of me, unless they really need me. They don't have to be that any more. I am very clear and straight and awake after my second NDE. I wonder so much where this takes me.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I really do believe that people taking advantage of me, using me as a counsellor and soul-healer already before I went to school are related to my open heart and all-encompassing love brought out into the earthly world. Even my mother and father has quoted me the only one to understand them, and I accepted that for years and years until I withdraw and left them to find friends of their own age.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  This is an experience, that has been first in my recall of early childhood. After the light, the sense of water running downwards my face, the lukewarm running over eyes and forehead, some discomfort around my nose, and the sadness and anger building up inside is strong. My mother held my angles and shook me rather violently to get the water out of my lungs.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I believe, that what I have described in Q49 has developed over the years to an extend it would not have, had I not been in heaven as a child.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Yes, I have never doubted the love from within.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I don't know when I started sharing; whether I told my mother directly after it had happened, or whether that was just a part of me, I did not consider telling. But I have told many as an adult.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     It has always been real to me, so I guess it was real at the age of four too  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     The minute I started reading IANDS's website along with Rings work and Sutherlands, I had no reason to accept any shy or private attitude towards my first NDE anymore. I have read Even Alexander before and also Moorjani, and I have had my own experience as a confirming background. But with my second NDE 49 years after the first, I was steadily open and I don't care what people say or think, and the aftereffects describes have secured that whatever light I saw as a toddler, it was not the sun breaking the waves above my head while drowning. I have LIVED all those aftereffects all my life. They have been my reality.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   I have submitted my second NDE already. I guess it will be published along with this one under 'Siri, Denmark'. In short, I was dancing in a huge metal globe, first reluctantly, then giving in t a major blast of thousands of thousands of smaller explosions, destroying my cells shells, my new I being the light, the powers and the dynamics. And I was a donna in a décolletaged red dress stopping the multi bacteria approaching to invade me, setting my borders in Spanish even though I did not know the word 'stop' in that language. And a polar bear came to rescue me, and bit my left flank and let me sleep between his legs, my back to his stomach, protecting and healing me. And I saw my stomach from inside with all the loose threads from the surgery and heard my forehead and my sister's forehead speaking a highway of Finnish language, even though I do not know how to speak the language. And beyond all this the question was posed in a split of second and from the inner realm I know from before, whether I wanted to live og go on, and to my own great surprise, I simultaneously said: 'Thy will happen, but IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY, I WANT TO LIVE'. And that was like it was granted and a formality at the same time. Just to make sure, we agreed. But it was up to me, and the whole experience was about learning and integrating the tools deeply into my cells that is so necessary for me to accomplish anything at all.  I have also has beautiful experiences along the way with other realms, and I have great sense of reality and bonding in those, but connecting in come exceeds them all.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         No  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I would love to have been able to make my two NDE's in one form, and I have also much more going on between the two when it comes to for instance what we get, when we get our NDE's. First time, I got the mere knowledge, second, I got what I so much needed to widespread the knowledge. I have worked light- and heart work all my life. Maybe time has come to take it to a more common level. I am not totally recovered yet, so the second has not been integrated to the level of work life, but I bear a sense, it will work in this direction.
