I know people who work I don&#39;t know that
particular lab name I know people who
have worked with you know very high
voltage experiments in space-time
bubbles as it were dealing with that yes
yeah yeah and that is not a myth and
that is you can do that and that begins
to bring up the question of phasing in
this science the attitude now is let&#39;s
not open Pandora&#39;s box keep it all
secret meanwhile the earth is dying and
I think that it does present however a
conundrum which I I had a conversation
with the colonel who was in charge of
the euphemism is future technologies for
the Air Force which means they have it
already and I was at a private meeting
here in the DC area and he pulled me
aside he said you know these
technologies can be weaponized I said oh
yes I know and they already had them by
elements that are out of control and
aren&#39;t under the control of the
President and the Congress and he says
yes but so we can&#39;t let this be known
and I said here is that here&#39;s the the
big conundrum of our time if these
technologies come out and they&#39;re used
for malevolent weapons purposes very
dangerous if they don&#39;t come out and our
only solution ends up being things that
are fracking and gas and just pumping
more stuff out of the earth and burning
up the atmosphere that&#39;s an existential
problem so everyth we&#39;re in an
existential crisis where the only path
forward is to have people who are wise
and the public being educated where
these technologies are brought out and
are strictly limited to non weapons
applications and that is enforced
absolutely strictly how do you do that
well you can&#39;t do it by causing the
international community to have no
say-so at the same time there&#39;s always
going to be some sociopathic leader of
some country some madman who&#39;ll want to
do something and that&#39;s what the
intelligence community worries about so
that is not a trivial concern and I do
not dismiss it because I&#39;m not a trivial
person frankly however the secrecy is
killing us so and the disclosure of all
this not only information and the
contact component of it but also that
we&#39;re not alone in the cosmos which is
an enormous disclosure but the
technological let&#39;s say basket there&#39;s a
basket with all kinds of different
technologies that are classified at
least a generation 1.0 ones that we get
us all fossil fuels should come out then
let&#39;s have a disguise I made this
agreement with people in the
intelligence community that I would not
work on the ones that disrupt space-time
that are weaponized or that would result
in lift now a lot of people don&#39;t like
that when they hear that because they
want to have something lights of George
Jetson I want my car to float and go I
said someday but the anti-gravity as
it&#39;s called in pop culture but the
electromagnetic gravitate component of
this which is a very high voltage system
that causes the lift effect because that
whole spacecraft has a charge around it
creates kind of a spacetime bubble and
becomes essentially massless or close to
massless a very light although when it
sets down it&#39;s very heavy when it&#39;s full
of when that system is shut off it&#39;ll
bend a railroad tie is so heavy weighs
tons but when it sits just like it looks
like it&#39;s floating which it essentially
it is that technology has obvious shall
we say missile and airforce applications
and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve said at this point
I&#39;m happy to leave that alone
so even when that&#39;s been offered to me
and it has been in fact I recently
received a bunch of blue
from a grandchild of a man who worked on
the early anti grab devices I have it in
my ball we have it but that&#39;s for a
later phase now we&#39;re running out of
time to come out with a generation 1.0
energy system which which can be done
and configured so it&#39;s a stationary
object that&#39;s not doing anything that&#39;s
too magical but this is creating quote
free energy from the zero-point field
that pulls the civilization off the
death spiral that&#39;s in with the current
geopolitical and geophysical crisis with
fossil fuels but that&#39;s but let&#39;s at
least do that I always tell people let&#39;s
crawl before we walk and walk before we
run and run before we levitate all right
but we&#39;re we&#39;re on our backs right now
our civilization is on its back I&#39;m not
even rolling around like a
three-month-old we need to get up and at
least aren&#39;t moving in this correct
direction and that&#39;s why I feel it&#39;s
very important for us to be honest I try
to be as honest as I can with people
about the implications of some of the
far end of this technology being
something that is worrisome if it were
in the wrong hands
and that brings up the bigger question
oh isn&#39;t the crisis really a social
spiritual cultural crisis in
consciousness the consciousness of
wanting to take whatever we invent and
weaponize it to get gain dominion over
someone else or some other culture that
is the that is at the root the
fundamental problem and that is a
spiritual problem and a psychological
and cultural sociological problem that
we have to address at the same time but
we&#39;re running out of time to do it
sequentially because here&#39;s here&#39;s
here&#39;s the conundrum how do you create a
peaceful world where everyone singing
Kumbaya when half the world&#39;s population
is in dire poverty and there are 30 some
people
have more than half of the net worth of
the world in their control this is not
something that is a sustainable system
but you can so at some point we have to
break out of that I look at it as sort
of this coda sack that we&#39;ve been in for
a hundred years sort of a blind end
street we&#39;ve been running around in
circles and the technology I know that I
work a lot of people who you know been
in Silicon Valley in various what we
call high tech sector I just go not high
tech this is high tech there&#39;s nothing
high tech about a smartphone or a
computer at all and by the way they&#39;re
plugged into a coal-fired power grid
from the 1800s
so a little perspective here is
necessary and that is part of the
problem is that we&#39;re trying to catch up
on a hundred I call it the lost century
great title for a book and a video by
the way but the lost century there&#39;s a
lost century of not just technological
development a sociological economic
cultural development because of the
suppression of this area of science and
and information and because of that
we&#39;ve kind of run out how much time we
have before it&#39;s like a rubber band that
you consider at the time time is like a
rubber band you can stretch it out Uruk
and contract but we pulled this rubber
band as about as far as it can till it
snaps and the snap can be a geopolitical
crisis war or can be a geophysical
crisis where we have both polar ice caps
melting or what-have-you but ultimately
we&#39;re at that point and I&#39;m not trying
to sound at all political but I&#39;m just
saying that as the Chinese saying goes
unless we change directions we&#39;re likely
to end up where we&#39;re going so where we
were the trend lines are very disturbing
and everyone kind of is diverted into
the internet and they all think that
that&#39;s oh we&#39;re doing such great
technology but there&#39;s nothing your car
is a 1800s internal combustion engine
literally from the 1800s trains mid
1800s a nuclear power plant is a steam
engine basically you&#39;re getting heat
from splitting the atom you&#39;re boiling
water creating steam that turns a
turbine all other 1800s you just have
all this nuclear waste that what most
people don&#39;t know it&#39;s not you&#39;re not
getting energy directly from the atom
it&#39;s just heat the boiled water that&#39;s
why I have these huge tooling cooling
towers and if you think that&#39;s not a
problem go visit Fukushima and then you
have jets
well jets are invented in the 1930s so
those of you in flew here on a jet you
were flying on us a souped up version of
a 1930s jet engine and rockets
Wernher von Braun 1940&#39;s for the v2
rocket every technological breakthrough
an energy and propulsion since the 40s
has been classified so now we&#39;re running
on seventy years of this secrecy which
is as Eisenhower predicted run amok but
in the classified world as you rightly
point out there are programs that have
gone a pace I mean they&#39;re on generation
five hundred of stuff that most people
can&#39;t even believe would exist there
would their eyes would roll back even
the physicist at MIT their eyes would
focus roll back so we&#39;re at least need
to catch up with say 1920 I mean so
people think what I&#39;m proposing is very
Boras and I&#39;m really very moderate about
saying where we&#39;re trying to catch up to
but most people don&#39;t know the history
this lost century that at the cost of
secrecy and and an out of control
national security state that has gotten
hybridized and placed mainly in the
corporate world all the big action is
corporate all right you know SAIC Booz
Allen Hamilton Lockheed my uncle&#39;s old
company Northup Grumman he was Grumman
when they&#39;ve developed the lunar module
etc and so on and so mitre corporation
bae systems these are all so if you you
know you get you know the hundred to two
hundred billion dollars missing
the out of the US Treasury every year
going into these corporate entities
through a front door program that&#39;s
really a shell it&#39;s like the Mafia using
a restaurant to launder their money and
then it goes into a backdoor black
project unacknowledged special access
project which is the proper term and
that&#39;s Matt you know when Eisenhower
said to where the military-industrial
complex it was a little bit of money
Rumsfeld as you&#39;ve seen in the film
serious back in the day before 9/11 said
its two point three trillion dollars
unaccounted for trillion now since 9/11
that the amount of spending in that
sector has gone way up so it&#39;s an
enormous amount of funding and resources
that are going into projects now the
President and members of Congress or
senator Feinstein has to pretend like
they know everything that these
corporations and entities are doing
cause after all the emperor doesn&#39;t want
to admit he has no clothes no and this
was one of the things that was pointed
out to me in meeting with the CIA
director and other people is that no
president wants to admit that there&#39;s
this big permanent infrastructure
running a pace siphoning off hundreds of
build 2.3 trillion dollars in funding
that neither the president nor the
oversight Committees of the Congress
over here have any knowledge of no one
wants to admit that well why because
they would it would create this
constitutional crisis like we&#39;ve never
seen and we&#39;re seeing a little bit of
that with senator Feinstein kind of mud
wrestling with the CIA over the torture
stuff but this would be that a thousand
times more difficult and complex so I&#39;ve
had members of the Senate who I have
members of the Senate Intelligence
Committee I met with in the past we&#39;ve
gone we&#39;ve suspected these things are
going on but we are never briefed on
