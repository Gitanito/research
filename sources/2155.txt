It was established on June 19, 1957 in Durham, North Carolina.1 &nbsp;It is a private, 501(c)(3), tax-exempt non-profit organization which currently houses its office in Columbus, Ohio, USA. The Association’s mission is to promote research and scholarship into currently unexplained aspects of human experience; provide responsible information to the public and to the scientific community; and integrate this information with research and ideas from other disciplines.2 &nbsp;It has been affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) since 1969.

The idea of an international, professional organization of parapsychologists was publicly proposed by the creator and director of the Duke Laboratory, Dr JB Rhine, at a workshop in parapsychology at the Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University. The proposal was well received and it quickly became a reality.3 &nbsp;

Since its conception, the international aspect of the Association has been a key focus.4 &nbsp;Founding members were aware that professional scientists interested in parapsychology are spread far and wide and that the organization needed to be able to reach them in order to accomplish its mission. A committee made of Dr JG Pratt (chairman), Dorothy H Pope and Wadih Saleh was set up to draft a constitution.5

Since the beginning the PA has been made up of members from a myriad of professional backgrounds, including specialists in the biological, physical, behavioral and social sciences. It supports a variety of approaches: laboratory experimentation, phenomenological methods, case and field studies, and historical research.6 &nbsp;

A common misconception is that all members of the PA are ‘believers in psi’. In fact each individual member holds his or her own opinion, and the Association as an entity neither confirms nor denies the existence of psi. Rather, it affirms that parapsychology is ‘supported by twin pillars: open-minded scientific study and rigorous doubt’; and encourages responsible scholarship and research into currently unexplained aspects of human experience.7  Staff and Structure

The PA’s first board included Dr RA McConnell of the Biophysics Department of University of Pittsburgh (president), Dr Gertrude R Schmeidler of the Department of Psychology at City College of New York, and Rhea White (secretary treasurer). Other founding board members included Dr Margaret Anderson, Dr Remi Cadoret, Dr Karlis Osis, and Dr William G Roll.8

The PA’s bylaws, initially instated in November 1985,9 &nbsp;can be found on its website.10 &nbsp;The organization is overseen by the Board of Directors and an Executive Director. The Board consists of nine Directors whom are elected by Professional and Associate Members. Two of these seven Directors are the President and Vice-President, who are ex-officio Directors. Directors may serve a term of two years and cannot exceed three consecutive terms. The Executive Director is an appointed employee of the PA and is a non-voting member that serves the board. The Executive Director since 2007 is Annalisa Ventola. Past presidents include notable figures in the field such as Gertrude Schmeidler, JG Pratt, Ian Stevenson, Hans Bender, and Robert Van de Castle.  Membership

They are also given online access to an electronic archive of selected convention papers and videos. Voting rights in elections and meetings are reserved for Professional and Associate Members.  Other Representatives

International liaisons can be contacted by members or perspective members of their respective countries.15

Each year, a Student Representative is elected to be the liaison for Student Members and prospective Student Members.  Events and Publications  Conventions

In 1958 the PA held its first annual convention, at City College in New York. The annual convention gathers professionals of parapsychology, and others who are interested in the topic, for a weekend of presentations and activities. The first convention outside of the US was held in 1964 at Oxford University.16 &nbsp;Presently, annual conventions alternate yearly between North America and Europe. North American locations have included Duke University, University of Virginia, and Stanford University. European locations have included the University of Greenwich in the UK, University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, and the Titania Hotel in Athens.17  Other Events&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

The PA encourages members to hold regional Association meetings (community oriented events). Regional PA meetings require a professional member to be liaison.

The PA periodically holds community outreach events at its office in Columbus, Ohio. Such events have included regional meetings, anniversary celebrations, art exhibits, and documentary premieres related to parapsychology and exceptional experiences.  Publications

The PA publishes the Mindfield Bulletin exclusively for its members. Mindfield is published three times a year and includes scholarly articles, news, columns by the PA president, and information on laboratories and researchers from around the world.

The Journal of Parapsychology, published by the Rhine Research Center, is an affiliated publication of the PA. It publishes the abstracts of papers from the PA’s Annual Convention. Since 2010, the Journal of Parapsychology has been available online to PA members.  Grants and Awards
