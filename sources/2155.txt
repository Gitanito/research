LECTURE ON CONSISTENCY.
Al we gradually awake from the uncon11Cious sleep of infancy, to
a perception ofthe appearances and occurrenc,,s of this bu~y earth,
we find ourselves existing in a world of multiform scenes anti of
Taried interest. And as our senses throw off the lethargy that
enTelopes their infant growth, so does the horizon ofour ob!!ervi>-
tion expand. Every day brings new objects to our curious view,
and every hour adds another item to the sum of .our experience.
We approach our finger to the dazzling candle, and we learn thnt
its bright flame burns. Gradually we discover the · sources of
pleasure, and the causes of pain. We are taught that exercise
braces our ne"es, and that tempera.nee establishes our heal!h ;
that idleness destroys the mind, and excess the body. W e feel
the placid influence 9f kindly emotions, and we see the blighting
influence of ungoverned passions. Amid the c.>m.iicting pheno-
mena of human life-in each passing event, and under every
change that c<.mcs over us-we seek happiness ; sometimes,
when experience has been our teacher, to find it ; sometintes,
alas ! at the bidding of imagination, to find it not.
There is in roan, and in youth especially, a restless spirit of
curiosity; an unsatisfied thirst after .novelty; an irrepressible
desire to see. to hear, to feel, to know-to discover whatever is
hidden, anti to approa<'h whatever is distant. Its movements first
1tart us i" the path of knowledge; and its gratification is our ~·­
ward, as we proceed.
llfuch has this spirit of inquiry done for man. W ithout it he
would be but as a passive mass, scarcely roused to exertion but
by the immediate press•.IJ'e of his wants ; and, the!!e satisfied,
ready to sink back again into uninterll9ted listlessness. T hnt
stirring spirit whets his senses, quickens his perceptions, spurs his
industry, ne"es his enterprize, and strengthens his pel'l!everan<'e.
It leads him th!'ough every clime, into every country: to the
mountain summit, where snows a.re eternal, and across the arid
cl.ert, where life is extinct

11 would ~in lead him beyond the mountain and the desert ;
a,! even in de~pite of his limited senses, beyond our earth and
her ph~·>1nena.. But it is hard to pass the limita of knowledge
which thwe senses prescribe.
~ can, indeed, watch the balloon as it rises above the lofty
sum~r doud, and see it disappear. in the blue ether. We cun
rise with that balloon, until we look down on the storm, and st·o
the lightning springing beneath us. ~IJ.t to th~ earth from wh~nc.­
it had risen the floating ball returns, and brings back with it•the
travellers to their sublunary home.
\Ve can look on the distant stars, or on the nearer moon ; but,
<'l"Cn with the best aids 'vhich moden1 science supplie~ to our
vision, how little do we see ! how little can we learn ! We can
indeed disco,·er that these stars and that moon exist. But if they
be worlds witll phenomena analagous to those that surround us
here, for us, at least, their imagined phenomena have no exist.
ence. If living and moving beings inhabit these sparkling globes,
for us they neither live, nor move, nor have a being. If we speak
of these inhabitants, we speak of nonentities, in the attempt to
dcsrribe which language becomes utterly insignificant. Few and
imperfect, then, are the impressions \Ve receive, uncertain and
srnrity the knowledge we acquire. of e::i:istenc~ out of this world.
Our own material earth, as 've see it, and hear it, and feel it around
us, is that portion of matter which alone distinctly exists to our
human perceptions and human exp~rience. On it we walk; on
it we live. The familiar phenomena that hourly strike our senses
are of this world. The beings whose welfare c1aims our care, an.:
whose fates arouse our sensibili\ies, a.re all of this material world
alone.
Still, that restless, unsatisfied spirit of thirsty curiosity will
not be confined, eTen to earth. It has passed to other re-
gions ; and brought us back information true or false concern-
ing them.
Men have said that there exis!.9 somewhere in space, far beyond
the limits of man's Tision, and without the sphere of man's perC<'p-
tions, a certain-place, must I call it ? I know not. Our earthly
language is but ill adapted to giTe names to spiritual residences.
But, since we of the earth can speak the earth's language only,
we will call it-a place, named hea,·en.
Even tradition ventures no conjecture as to the extent of this.
location, nor furnishes any distinct accoUJ1t of the particular phe-
nomenn it exhibits. I believe it is usually imagined.to contain a
stupcndous throne, surrounded by bright cloud~, a.11d difi'usin11: on
all sides a light of exceeding brilliancy. In the space around this.
thron~, 1uyrinds-I was nbout to aay, of human beings; but here.
11e;ai11 our 1nw1danc language is at fault. Tile existences whicb
LJICTURB ON CON8ISTJlNCY.
-are imagined around that throne of brightness, are not human be-
mgs. Many of them are indeed said to be the sa1ne which once
lived and acted upon earth under that name, and are.i,magined to
.possess forms of sutpa:>eing beauty: but these formfe ~~ not of
material figure or corporeal dimensions; they have, ~fore, 110
material existence, ·and cannot, by the most ventured stretch 01
analogy, be .termed human beings. But, whatever the name 1111-
der which we choose to imagine them, myriads of existences lll'e
said to surround -that throne. Each of these existences, we a.re
told, retains a sense of identity with some individual man or 'Yo-
man who formerly lived on this earth. They have one occupa-
tion only. lt is that of pronouncing praises and thanksgivings,
and of executing songs and hymns, accompanying I.heir voice~
on golden harps. Thus, we arc informed, they shall exist llirough-
out eternity. ·
· Men have said also, that on this throne, whence the light pro-
ceeds which illuminates •lhe space called heaven, an immaterial
being has his.residence. Xhey tell us that to this omnipotent e:it-
istence the thank!>givings and ·hymns ofthe inhabibmts of hca1Ven
are addressed; as well in .order to increase that being's glory, as
because he.is '\\'ell pleased.to receive such praise.
It is said that the occupation i!s(jlf is to the immaterial spirits,
who were formerly human beings, a source of ·unceasing enjoy-
ment, infinite in degree ·a.nd endless in duration. It is asserted,
that " eye hath not seen,:nor ear beard, nor the heart of man
conceived," the ·unclouded and ·eternal felicity of that distanl
abode. All earthly enjoyments, we are told, are but as worth1esll
,·ani.ty compared .to the bliss of ·one moment thus spent in
heaven.
But there is ·also'6Il«Kher>Unearthly location of which, it is said,
human beings have obtained some particulars. It is situated
w.ithin :vie•v of heaven, <Wherever 'that may be ; and is separated
l'rom the heavenly .kingdom by a great gulf 'Which is fixed between
tl!~se i:wo Jesidences. It.has been ;
called hell, a:nd is usually ima-
gined to contain a !alee of prodigious extent. '1'his lake is on fire;
it is filled with brimstone, which bums without ceasing, and
emits a smoke as of a great futnace. It is said to eontaiJ1, in its
.burning waters, .millions on 1nillions of ·wretched existences, a
great proportion·Of whom "·ere once human beings. These are
tormented in the flame, and are not even allowed a drop of water to
i<:ool their tongu$J. They \vill continue throughout etemit)' to be ·
'so tormented-o .and. though. changed in their nature no less than
the inbabitan~:ofheaveq, they also retain a consciousness of their
tormer state of existence upon earth.

"'u~s. \Ve are told that the keys of the gates of hell are in the
11-.:i<h of the creator of the. uui•·erse, and those of the gat~ of

Other particuh•r<> reganting heaven and hell I might add, ou
the authority of those who profess to be accurately informed; but
the accuwlls ·appear to me somewhat contradictory, and very in-
distinct. Jn what maru1er or at what time the bodie&-<>r as s6me
have it, the living principles-of those wb.o die on earth, are sup-
posed to be conveyed to their future abodes, I cannot clearly ex-
,J>lain to yon ; for the documents relating to this subject are not
very explicit. It is, so far as I can learn, generally imagined,
either that these bodies or living principles are conveyed thither
im1nediately after death, or else lie asleep for some thousand
years, until a day when the heavens shall be 101led together as a
scroll, and the stars shall fall on the earth, like untimely figs cut
fro1n so1ne fig-tree that is shaken of a mighty wind ; that then, on
that day, these bodies or living principles shall be awoke from
tlleir long slumbers by the sounding of seTen trumpets, and shall
stand before thti throne that is raised in the midst of heaven, to be
judged from books in which have been regularly recorded for tlle
laet six thouS>lnd ye&n:l all the action.e of mankind, whether they
have been good _
or whether they have been eTil.
Many glowi!_lg pictures have been drawn of the joys of heaven,
and many frightful descriptions given of the torments of hell. I
can still recollect the vividness of perception which charac-
terised my infant conceptions of both plac-the thousand
questions I used to ask about them, and the mingled sensa-
tions of delight and horror which the replies to my question.e pro-
duced within me.
Mri. Hemans has beautifully expreeeed, in the following linee,
the vague ideas which a child first conceiTes of heaven, and the
indefinite, but the enthusiastic and exciting answers, that are
usually made to it.

If is a Iese pleasingtask to lay before youthe deacript.ionawhich
are presented to us of the region of endless mi8ery. I select for ·
that purpoee the following from the pen of a much respected
orthodox religionist, the Rev. Mr. Edwards, as giTen in his "Die-
eoursea on the Eternity of Hell Torments."
"Be entreated," says he, " to consider attentiTely how great
and awful a thing eternity j.e. Although you cann·ot comprehend ·
it the more by considering it, yet you may be made more sensible
that it is not a thing to be disregarded. Do but consider what it
is to eu.lfer extreme pain for eTer and eTer; to eu.lfer it day and
night, from one day to another, from one year to another, from
one age to another, Crom one thousand ages to another, and so
adding age to age, and thoWl&Jlds to thoUl&nds, in pain, in wailing
and lamenting, groaning and shrieking, a.nd gnashing your teeth ;
wi~ your souls ~ull or dreadful grief a.nd &IJ!&zement, with. your
bodies and every member of them full of racking torture; without
any po111ibility of getting ease; without any poaaibility of moving
God to pity your cries; without any possibility of lµding your.
selTee from him ; without any possibility of diverting your
thoughta from your pain ; without anypossibility of obtaining auy
manner of mitiplion, or help, or cha.nge for the bet.ter. How
dismal will it be, "When you are under these racking torments, fl
know assuredly that you never, never shall be delivered fro!l
them ; to haTe no hope-when you shall wish that you might be
turned into nothing, but shall have no hope of it; when you shall
wish that you might 'be tiarned into a toad, or a serpent, but shall
8

out the age of the sun, moon,·and.st&rs, µi your dolorowi gro&na
and lamentations, without rest, day or night, or one minute's ease,
yet you shall have no hope of being delivered; when, after
you have worn out a thousand more such ages, •
7et you
sh&ll have no hope, but ehaJI know that you are ·,not one
whit nearer to the end of your torments; that llli.11 Uitte are the
same groaps, the ll&llle shrieks, the same doleful criee.incessanlly
to be made ·by you, and that the smoke of your torment 8hall still
ascend for ever and ever ; and that your soul•, which shall have
been agitated by tho wrath of God all this·while, al1all still exist

I have thus.endeavoured to furnish you with a sketch of the
most commonly reoeived opinions regarding heaven an<i llell ; an
impartial sketch. 80 far u I can judge; and though not very Ju.
minoll]l nor jlefinite, yet u much so, perhaps, as the nature of the
subject- ifindeedwe can talkof the nllhw•ofthat w}\ich is.avper.
1tat(iral'.--as1uminous, perhaps, and definite as the nature of sv.oh
a subject and the character of'human language permit.
But besides the sketch of the ·t>laces ·themselves, we are fur.
nished, by those who conceive themse1ves well-informed in such
matters, wi.th a statement of the means by which we, the present
occupants of the earth, can become inhabitants of heaven, or in·
mates ofhell.
The coD.Qitions of admission to these two places, it is said, are
contained in a book called the Bible. The legally appointed ex-
pounders ofthat book inform us, that,to obtain a place in hea.v1111
1t is necel!SUY to believe all that the Bible relates, to perfonp the
spiritual exercises it dictates, and to obey the .precepts it enjoins.
They i~f9Jlll us also, that ~· failure t~ comply with these .eondi,
qous will C@>JlSC us to re-ex1st for ever 1n hell.
'l'his is one side of the great-I may ·say, the engrossing ques.
tion, of T'lli.rir>D. and ii. i.
e tho i;ide 'l"bir.h b.u hitherto been ta)l;.en
up by a 00hMden..0te patbon of <he clmued world.
Others, however, there are,--,nnd the number ia on the in-
crease-who do not believe in the descriptions I have given you;
and who cannot see any reason to .conclude, that a belief in the
Bible, or ~e performance of any spiritual ceremonies whatev.er,
can influence, alter, or in llllY way determine for us a future state
of existence in unllilen regions. On the contrar;r, they are of
epinion, th"~ while we remain here on earth, we can correctl7

know and URderstand thl:9 tllinga only which appertain tt> the
car1h, and can make no 118ef'ul, practica.l d.iscoTeries out of our
own planet.
Now, I am not about to discuss this question. It is not my
present intention to inquire whether we can make and have made
such superhuman discoveries, or whether we have not made and
cannot ri.ake them.
But permit me earnestly to request your serious, undivided ai..
U:ntion to the proposition I am about to state to you.
Either we HAVE information regarding these .two rcsidenctl!,
heaven and hell, or we HA.VII NOT. This ·is as self-evident as any
mathematical tntism.
\Vhat follows 1 Either that we ought to occupy ourselves in
ascertaining these terms of admisaion and in complying with
them, or we ought not. It is of exceeding importance that we
should wdll consider what this alternative involves.
And, first, let us inquire what proportion of our lives should
be devoted to examine and fulfil these terms of admission, on tlN
w.pposition that we can ascertain what they arc. To discover
this it ·may be ex·pedient that.we seek to understand, if we can,
1'¥teternity means, seeing that the state of being in question is
safd to be ei.emal.
It has been calculated that the distance from hence to the sun
is ~arly one hundred millions of miles; and tl1e distance to
Slriuf!. Che ne11.rest of the fii:ed stars, n1ore than five hundred thou.
sand times greater. The distance to the more remote among the
fixed stan has neTer been calculal.ed. But conceive, if it be
po.ssible, how immense the di8tance from our .earth to the re·
n1oteet star that teleacope eTer aided 1111 to discover. Then
imagine a circle drawn at that inconeeive.ble distance all round
our earth, and suppose a globe of llUld of such stupendous dimen-
sions that its circumference should fill up that mighty circle.
Imagine each grain of that sand one million times less than the
smallest nnime.lculo which microscope cm1r made 'fisib\o. How
utterly beyond the power of imagination must be the number of
these grains that should go to make up the whole enormous
mass! And now imagine that one of these imperceptible graina
•ere detached from that mass at the close of each million of
centuries. How long, tltink you, would·it require ore the whole
irnme3SUJ'able globe was thus dissolved, grain by grain 1 Do not
your human senses refuse even to imagine the period 1 Do you ·
not feel that you are approaching a region ot imagination that
belongs not to man 1 If I asked you how many moments that
period may contain, might I not seem to ask it in derision r
And yet each single moment it contain!J is millions on milliolll
of times longer, compared to the period itself, than ie the period
10 UCTURJI ON CONSISHNCY.
compared to eternity. Let such a globe be formed, and thus le•·
sen by one grain each million of centuries, until, grain by grl\in,
it pass away. Let another of eqUAl dimensions replace it, in like
manner to lessen and to disappear. Then another, and another,
until thouaandahaTe been added to thoWWlda, and millions to miJ.
lions, in the stupendousaucceeaion. Then take the sum of these
immeuurable periods, and deduct it from eternity. ,
HaTe you obtained a tenth, a thouaandth, a millionth part?
HaTe you obtained the smallest expressible fraction ? HaTe ye
1hortened eternity eTen by one fleeting instant r WouldJe be,
even by one single moment, nearer the end or eternity, · these
unimagined periodswere come 11Dd put, than you are at this day1
Now, it ia this period of eternity which, we are told, is to be
apent in heaTen or hell. If terms of admission to both places
have, in TUJ truth, been tendered to us, our comf.liance or non-
compliance with these temll lhall alfect our we! -being tlwougA
tJaia ,..nod of1Umity.
I recur, then, to my question. " What proportion of our time
may reasonably be deToted to the fulJilment of these term., if
they haTe been so tendered r 11Dd what proportion to the re-
mainder of our bUlinesa P" In other words, " How much of
each day or week lhould be employed for heaTen, and howmuch
for earth P"
How much1 Sup~ you had two bags, one containing a
cent, and the other a million of dollars : what proportion of your
time might be reasonably deToted to the care of the cent, and
what proportion to that of the million of dollan? Would ye
spend for that paltry cent ri:e daya out of the seTen. or OM day
out of the seTen, or one hour of a single day? You would not;
you know too well the relatiTe Talue of moneyw.
Have ye ever accurately calculated the relatiTe Talue of a life
one hundred years long, and a life throughout eternity? U you
have, and if you sincerely belieTe in orthodox supernaturals, you
have come to the conclwdon that one minute per week ia incal-
culably too much to spend for this world, and lix daya, twenty.
three holll'll, and fifty-nine minutee per week too little to 1pend
for the next.
Obeene. then. I pray you, what this question about untee1l
regions inTolTea. Not the occupetion of one day in aeven, but of
TOUR LIVES. Not the JMionll direction Of a portion of your
money, a portion of your talent., a portion of your influence, but
of ALL. This the moat orthodox and zealous among religioua
minislAlrs themselTes openly declare.
Allowme to repeat the alternatiTe towhich I haTe already called
your attention. Either we can know nothing of heaven, and can
P.iJ1 admittance to it by our own exertions, or we ean not.

ward, bold in the strength of their holy mission, to engage, m
its support, every hand and every hear.t throughout the land.
Theirs should be our property, for God's use; thei.n our time,
for God's senice; theirs our talents, in God's cause; theirs our
obedience, according to God's command. Let them establish
their saintly rule over land and sea, forest and mountain, even
to earth's remotest confines. They have spoken of church and
&tate; let them speak of the church alone. She it is that should
command our submission and dictate our rights; because she
only can secure our everlasting ha}lpiness. Once, in !lie zenith
of her power-in those days when England's proud llonry knelt
'before Becket's tomb, and bared his body to tho ccclesia;;tica1
.teourge--in those pious days the wealth that flowed into her cof.
fers outweighed the treasures of kings, and the reverence she
obtained for her priestly decrees was beyond the reverence paid to
.the mightiest of the earth. Let her servants again clniin all, and
more than nil, they ever then possessed. If they be what they
profess to be, and what we permit them to call themsclves-tl1e
elected of God-it is theirs of right; it is all theirs, 111ost
justly, most consistently. If they save one soul-one only soul
-from the undying torments of hell, they lmve produced more
of happiness to the human race-millions of times told, than tho
riches of this earth can repay, or the power of all her potentates
confer. In gratitude, then, no less than in justice, earth's trea·
snres and powers should be theirs alone.
\Vil! ye tell me that those who .men cnll reverend are not the
servants of God ? that an Immaterial Spirit never adopted them
to be his confidants- never disclosed to l11c1n the secrets of his
government-never appointed the1n the expounders of his Ja,vs,
and the apologists of his conduct? Will ye tell me that morta!s
cannot find out the doings of any unseen, unsearchable spirit1
that hun1an knowledge cannot extend beyond " the bourn from
whence no traveller rehu:ns," to paint to us,brightly or dai:kly, a,
future, eternal destiny? \Viii ye tell me all this ? ,
And what of your country, if ye speak truth? \Vhat of tho
clerical influence that pervades, and the religious fear that rules
it t What of persecutings for scepticism and heartburnings for
het.erodoxy ? Is that influence, that fear, are those persecutings,
those heartburnings, nil uncalled for ?-all uncaused, save by
imagination alone ? But what of all the sights and sound.s that
fill your city on this, the first day of the week ?-the measured
toll that calls to the h.ouse of worship; tl1e gaily-decked throng

clMm tl1e credulity oi man? is the gay throng decked out only to

i1nagina.tion? and these fluent orators, are they but the tcachert

with ill! stea.m-p.resscs and ils tl1ousand hands ? Is it all but the
stereotyping of fables? the waste of public money ? the abuse of
public confidence ? W ill ye tell me all this ?
There are those who begin to whisper such heresy very UJ1cere-
moniously, very audibly. If they speak truth, my friends, alas
for the credulity, or, yet more, for the supineness, of our coun-
try! When will she awake to distinguish the mental fetters that
are forged on her children's minds? when assume courage to
shake off the system thatsits, like an incubus, on the best efforts
ot her genius ? when see fit to arrest the increase of those spiri-
tual locusts, that swarm in clouds throughout our Christian land,
ahutt.ing out the free light.of heave.n even while they devour the
fair 11roduce of earth?
Again Jet me remind you, that I speak not now as asserting,
save hypothetically. I do but say, that religion ill all or nothing;
either that which deserves the devotion of our lives, or that which
merits not a moment's consideration; that the clergy are either
the heavenly-appointed eenanta of God, or the self.constituted
deceivers of mankind. 1£ God'• eervanta, then, entitled to do.
minion on the earth beneath, and honoUl' eTen in heaven above ;
u deceivers, then-be they ho•eet ot' diehoncst-st.ill idle con-
sumers of llllearned wealth, and salaried opponents of truth and
knowledge.
Obaene, that I do but remind you that there is no consistent
ha.lting between two O
J>inione; no conacientious serving of two
masters; no compounding between !aith and scepticism. W e ·
know that the throne O( God eUla abOTe the clouds-or We
know it not; we have discovered the conditioWI under which we
may obtain a pla.ce among the myriads around that throne-or we
haTe notdiscovered them. Wearereligionista, or we are sceptics.
W ere I n. religioniat-did. I truly, firmly, OOMutmtly believe,
aa.millions sa7.they·do, that the knowledge and the practice of
religion in this li!o ln11.uencea destiny in another-the spirit of
truth be my witneae, religioo should be to me .wry thing. I
would cu.st aside earthly enjoymentll aa. dross, ear'2lly care•

11nu thieYe5 break thr.iugh to steal; but only {or a erown of ~lnry'
in heavenly regions, where treasures and happiness are alik•·
beyond the reach of time and ,chance. I would take thought
for the morrow of eternity alone. I would esteem one soul'
gnincd ,to heaYen W'>rth a life of torture. There should be
neither worldly prudence nor calculating circumspection in my
eni;ro88ing zeal. Earthly consequences should neYer stay my
hand nor seal my lips. I would S_Peak to the imagination,
awaken the feelings, stir ·up the passions, arouse the fancy; .I
-..-ould kindle the hot enthusiasm of youth, till it ·blazed with
holy forvour, consuming by its scorching. inftuence·all hum&A
feelings, and human rese"es, and human interests; and if re&-
wn melted away before the burning power, and the ·conTulsiona
of conversion were succeeded by the ravings of" insanity, th&f
should not, for a moment, arrest my course. Believing that it ii
better to enter into life insane, than, having the soundest reason.
to be cast into hell-fire, in a world changed to one great lunatic ·
u ylum I would see but the nursery of heaven. Eartli, '.the·
mortals it contains, its joys and its griefs, should occi:py no mo-
ment of my thoughts. The society of those I Joyed as my own
11<>ul should be to me valueless and vain, and the dearest pledgee
of their friendship worthless u a· paeeing shadow ; for these are
but the aft'airs of a portion of eternity 80 ·small, th&t· no ·h•unan
.language can express its infinite littleness.
I would etrive to look but on eternity and on the immortal· ·
IS'Ouls around me, soon to be everlastingly tortured or everlastingly
happy. I would deem an·who thought of this world-who
sought to increase mere temporal happiness, who laboured ·to
obtain temporal goods, who bestowed even a pa.&1ing thought on
the purest, dearest oftemporal pleasures-I \\•ould deem all such
.p<>or madmen. I would gc forth to the world aud preach to it,

As a sceptic, IPY feelings_
ann pracitices'would be the reverse of
all this. Doubting the accuracy of alJ predictions regarding our·
fate beyond the grave; convinced that we do not yet know, and
utterly sceptical as to whether we ever shall know, any thm.g
about it; perceiving not how we can influence· our situation in
any other world by any belie{ or religious· exercises in this,-1
would take a warm interest in the temporal happinesaof ma.I)kind.
I would consider the improTement of man's condition and the in-
crease of his enjoyments here; as objects in tllenuel'llU worthy the
best exertions-of the philosopher and the philanthropist. It should
&&tisfy ~e if l felt mysell· useful &o my fellow-creatures; and ~·
peace with myself. -1 would labour for fovd; eTen thoqll K

ther toil nor spin. I would not imitate the fowls of the air who
IOW not, nor reap, nor gather into barns. I would take though~
for the necessaries and comforts of life ; because I should distrust
the promise that a Being who feeds the sparrows of heaven and
clothes the lilies of the valley, will feed and clothe me also if I
but live in faith, and neglect all to follow his kingdom. I would
test the virtue and vice of actiona, not by their imagined efficacy
in procuring salvation hereafter, but by their present evident daily
e.lfects on the minds and bodies of my fellow-creatures. That
which injures the mind or the body, or which disturbs the tran.
( nility of the heart, I should judge to be wrong, whether tlw
eacred, books ofthe Jew or the Christian, the Mahometan or the
Hindoo confirmed or condemned the judgment. That which
brings calm enjoyment to the sen5e11, and peace to the bosom,·I
should decide to be right, without first waiting to inquire if the
name of Jehovah, or of Allah, or of Bramah, or any other name,
had been employed to 8&Ilction or to denounce the decision. For
me there should exist noartificial authoritative standard. I would
imagine no after.reckoning beyond the grave, to falsify or confu8e
my temporal calculations. To the earth and its inhabitants my,
duties should be conflried. With them I would associate, their
plans I would discuss, their wishes and feelings I would endea.
vour to ascertain. But for spirits of the air, I would addreea:
them neither in public nor in private ; nor would I ever disc1199
their plans or imagine their pleasure. To improve the earthly
condition of my fellow.beings, to merit their esteem, and to obtain
their affection, should be the extent of my ambition. I would
look to the hapJ:~ess I enjoyed in such a condition as to the end
oCmy being on · side the grave ; and for a. future etema.l des.
tiny, l would take no thought for it; because, however engros.
singly it would occupy my time and ta.lents, if I could know and
modify it, I should not peroeiYe the utility ofendeavouring to n•-
moYe a veil beyond which all is darkness, or to inftuence an un-
known destiny which is in other ha.nds tha.n mine. .
In either case, a.s religionist or a.a sceptic, I should be consis·
tent. I would not yrofess one thing a.nd practise nnother-nor
spenk of spiritualities with my lips, while n1y heart was fa.r fr...rn
them. What I called myself, that I would be. St. J ohn should
never accuse me, as he did the church of Laodicea., that [
wa.s neither cold nor hot. The thoughtless alone, or the hypo-
crite, is lukewarm ; &nd it ever has been and ever should be tbv
endeavour of each honest ma.n to avoid equally thoughtlessnet11
U1d hypocrisy.
