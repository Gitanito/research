This table lists them, along with those who are currently studying for a doctorate (italicized). &nbsp;The table can be viewed as a family tree of academic 'progeny',&nbsp;with currently three generations of PhDs. The progeny of Professor Robert Morris occupy an entire page, testimony to his particular contribution to academic parapsychology.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Their first supervisors are indicated in the column&nbsp;to the left. The second supervisor (for those that had one)&nbsp;is indicated by initials in parenthesis after their name. The number of 1st, 2nd and 3rd generation students are 48, 39 and 12 respectively, giving a total of 99.

An underline indicates that the person has obtained a permanent academic appointment. There are 37 of these and currently 17 departments in the UK where parapsychological research is pursued.&nbsp;The raised capitals&nbsp;identify the current university afiliation (see list below for key). An asterisk indicates that the person no longer does parapsychology research.&nbsp;
