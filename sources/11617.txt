  		              		Experience Description   

    After the birth of my child, I was very depressed and had been on medication for post-partum depression. I overdosed on this medication during the ride to the hospital. I was pronounced dead in the ambulance.  I was above my body and saw the emergency medical technician (EMT) working on my body below me.  I could hear everything they said and saw everything around me.  But the EMTs could not hear me while I was talking to them. Then I noticed my body below.  I realized that my mouth was not moving and that the body was in a reclined position in the ambulance. I remember that I moved to another dimension where there was an extremely bright, lighted area.  I was given the choice to stay or go back to my body so I could take care of my newborn child.
