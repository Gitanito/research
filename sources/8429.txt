    ABSTRACT:&nbsp;   A survey on different aspects of healing was e-mailed to   315 near-death experiencers (NDErs) who met the definition of &quot;a lucid experience   associated with perceived consciousness apart from the body occurring at the   time of actual or threatened imminent death.&quot;&nbsp; In short, these are   people who have died and come back to life.&nbsp; They come back with a   collection of memories that occurred during the time of death. The survey was also e-mailed   to 467 people who did not meet the above definition of near-death experience (NDE).&nbsp; Those people   who did not respond or whose e-mail was not current were subsequently mailed a   copy of the survey via the U.S. Postal Service.&nbsp; The non-NDErs came from a   pool of people who had experienced one or more paranormal events and who shared   this experience with either the www.nderf.org   (NDERF) or www.oberf.org (OBERF) websites.&nbsp;   Analysis results are based on the total of 124 NDErs and 75 non-NDErs who   responded.&nbsp; The healing questions pertained to the meaning of healing,   whether the participant had experienced any emotional or healing gifts and   whether the timing of these gifts was before or after their NDE or other   paranormal experience.&nbsp; They were also asked if they had healed anyone, and   if so to explain or give examples.&nbsp; Past studies are reviewed.&nbsp;   Present tension between medicine and alternative healing is explored.&nbsp; The   main finding of this study is that healing and evidentiality of alternative   healing depends on how a person views &quot;healing.&quot;&nbsp; Most of the time the way   a person views healing is part of a larger belief system rather than a   compartmentalized body of knowledge about the physical body.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    People who are near-death experiencers (NDErs) are people   who have died or experienced an imminent life-threatening event and subsequently   come back to life.&nbsp; They return with a   collection of memories that occurred during the time of death.  &nbsp;Some   of these memories are associated with an awareness of how to use certain gifts   that may or may not have been present prior to the experience.&nbsp; One of the more interesting things that      some NDErs report after a near-death experience, is that   they come back with healing gifts.&nbsp; It is also highly intriguing that one of the   most significant correlations between what is observed and expected is between   'universal order and purpose' and 'paranormal gifts' (Long, 2002).[1]    &nbsp;When my research colleague, Dr. Jeff Long, and I conceived of studying   healing gifts as a presentation for the International Association of Near Death   Studies (IANDS) 2003 annual conference, the presentation seemed quick and easy.&nbsp;   To our surprise, the project took on a life of its own and grew exponentially   from there.&nbsp; What resulted were answers to a newly conceived survey form in   which 124 NDErs responded and 75 non-NDErs responded.&nbsp; The pool of non-NDErs   came from two of our websites: 1) those who submitted to     www.nderf.org (NDERF) who did not have a NDE according   to our definition of NDE and; 2) those who shared with the     www.oberf.org (OBERF) website experiences that were   not a NDE or after death communication, mainly consisting of out of body   experiences, near-death like experiences, spiritually transformative events, and   other spiritual spectrum experiences.&nbsp;

Relatively few   studies have been done on this topic.&nbsp; A search of prior literature shows a 1983   study by Richard Kohr, who compared psi, dreams, and mystical states.&nbsp; One   element of the psi category consisted of healing.&nbsp; Here, a group of 84 NDErs,   who subjectively labeled themselves as NDErs, showed that the near-death   experiencers were significantly different from group of 'non-experiencers' and a   group of 'close to death only' experiencers&nbsp; with a p&lt;0.05.&nbsp; The NDE   group reported more psi-related experiences than the other two groups.&nbsp; The   suggestion for further study was that more data was needed to 'trace the manner   in which NDEs, spiritual and 'growth' practices, attitudes, and peak experiences   influence one another.

Kohr noted the   earlier study by Bruce Greyson in which Greyson found a significantly greater   incidence of reported psi and psi-related experiences after the NDE than before   (Greyson, 1983, p. 171).&nbsp; Greyson gave three alternative explanations for psi   susceptibility following a NDE.&nbsp; These explanations were: 1) the NDE may have   enhanced the individual's awareness of the psi abilities already possessed; 2)   there may be some recall bias or exaggerated delusions based on after-the-fact   recollection, or; 3) there may be 'some underlying third factor that may have   given rise to the NDE and was also responsible for the subsequent increase in   psi experiences' (p. 172).&nbsp; In summary, these alternative explanations can be   summed up as existing abilities prior to the NDE, abilities caused by the NDE,   dysfunctional memory, the same factor causes both, NDE and paranormal gifts, or   some combination of all or some of these factors.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

A 1989 Australian   study by Cherie Sutherland, involved 40 persons who subjectively labeled   themselves as NDErs. (Sutherland, 1989).&nbsp; This study looked at the incidence of   reports of psychic phenomena associated beliefs prior to and after the NDE and   compared to the general population.&nbsp; It is unclear where the data for the   general population came from or how many subjects were analyzed.&nbsp; However, the   following NDE results are notable and applicable to our study:

When Sutherland asked   each subject what the most significant change for them since the NDE, not one   person mentioned an increase in psychic phenomena.&nbsp; Her main finding was that   NDErs are not more psychically gifted prior to the NDE than the general public.&nbsp;

Bruce Horocek's 1997   study focused on the healing aspects of the NDE on dying and grieving   individuals (Horacek, 1997).&nbsp; The knowledge of the afterlife and the continuity   of life was a great comfort to these people.&nbsp; Lastly, Kenneth Ring's 1991 study   about the amazing grace of NDEs talks about the spiritually transformative and healing nature of NDEs and   NDE-like experiences on formerly anguished and hopeless lives when the   experience transforms personal, daily lives as a consequence of integrating the   NDE with reality on earth. (Ring, 1991).&nbsp; The knowledge of what life is like on   the other side gives purpose, hope, and meaning to our temporary suffering on   earth.

A few examples from   the medical world involve placebo effects and environment.&nbsp; One example is   how Beecher at Anzio beach head cared for wounded soldiers.[2]    &nbsp;Not one requested morphine.&nbsp; His comment was that if in a hospital   probably most would request morphine.&nbsp; Conclusion:&nbsp; environment can   influence how we respond.&nbsp; Another observation is that human responses to   placebo are strange.&nbsp;&nbsp; Around 30-40% of patients with many medical   conditions will respond just as well to a placebo as to medicine, e.g., even   gastric ulcers.&nbsp; Thus when testing a new drug placebos must be included in   testing, unless ethical considerations are present.
  
  Findings from the   survey data yield important clues to healing, what it means and how it works.&nbsp;   This study spring-boards from Kohr's research and delves into the manner in   which NDEs, spiritual and 'growth' practices, attitudes, and peak experiences   influence one another.&nbsp; It supports Sutherland's Australian study, because   participants discuss their views in relation to intuition, healing ability, life   after death, and lack of fear of death.&nbsp; Additionally echoed in sentiments   expressed by both, NDE and non-NDE participants, is the great comfort that death   is not the end of life and that there is a greater purpose to our existence on   earth.&nbsp; In the ensuing discussion, healing elements are contextualized and   expanded to understand how they might fit into a greater, universal purpose.

METHODOLOGY

Questions asked   on a survey of healing, specifically designed for the IANDS presentation,   pertained to the meaning of healing, physical healing, emotional healing,   healing of others, healing abilities prior to and after the experience, and   substance sensitivity.&nbsp; This survey was posted on the website     www.nderf.org.&nbsp; The survey was e-mailed to 315 NDErs   who met the Near Death Experience Research Foundation (NDERF) definition of 'A   lucid experience associated with perceived consciousness apart from the body   occurring at the time of actual or threatened imminent death&quot;&nbsp; (Long, 2002).&nbsp;   The survey was e-mailed to 359 people who submitted to the NDERF web survey who   did not meet the definition of a NDE.&nbsp; The survey was also e-mailed to a total   of 108 people who had contributed to the web survey on     www.oberf.org.&nbsp; Those people who did not respond or   whose e-mail addresses were automatically returned were then snail mailed via the U.S.   Postal   Pervice.&nbsp;

Out of a total of 315   NDErs, 124 (39.4%) responded to the survey.&nbsp; Out of 467 non-NDErs, 75 (16.1%)   responded to the survey.&nbsp; It is recognized that there is some selection bias   based on those who considered their experience important enough to share with   others, those who use the internet, those who are willing to participate in   lengthy surveys, and those who experienced healing would be more likely to   answer the survey than others.&nbsp; Additionally, there was a significant portion of   those who did not answer the survey for whom we did not have current information   to alert them about the survey.&nbsp; These people were not discovered until e-mail   bounced and letters containing the survey were returned as undeliverable.

Raw data were either   imported or hand-entered into either a NDE or a non-NDE database.&nbsp; Both   investigators cross-checked the data to ensure that those answering the survey   were accurately placed in the proper database.&nbsp;

Each 'yes,' 'no,' 'no   response,' or 'uncertain' (Y/N/NR/U) answer to questions was tabulated for both   tables and percentages of each response were calculated based on all answers and   again for only those who responded.&nbsp; A chi square analysis was calculated to see   if any of the answers between NDErs and non-NDErs were statistically significant   with a p&lt;0.05.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

Further, narrative   explanations to the Y/N/NR/U answers were analyzed for content.&nbsp; The answers   were then scored and placed into main categories that were mentioned by the   NDErs.&nbsp; Although one answer might be scored in more than one category, there was   only one experience answer per each category.&nbsp; Consequently, it is valid to   compare percentages of participants who answer in each category with the total   population who gave narratives answers to the question.&nbsp; However, percentages   calculated using a cross-comparison between the categories would not be valid.

Healing abilities   were compared before and after the experience.&nbsp; Participants were asked if they   experienced any changes in their healing abilities.&nbsp; Although there was   statistical significance between NDErs and non-NDErs, the results were not   really valid when compared for internal consistency and with the narrative   explanations.&nbsp; Figures were adjusted into two categories; whether they had   healing abilities and whether this represented a change from abilities prior to   the experience.&nbsp; For instance if someone reported no healing abilities prior to   their experience, and reported healing abilities after their experience, then   there should be a 'yes' answer in the change column rather than a 'no response'   answer.&nbsp;

Both, the NDERF and   the OBERF websites, were ask the question, 'Did you have any psychic, paranormal or   other special gifts following the experience you did not have prior to the   experience?'&nbsp; Out of 280 NDErs 259 (92.5%) and out of 330 non-NDErs 198 (60%)   answered the Y/N/NR/U part of the question.&nbsp; Those answering the narrative   portion of the question were 200 (63.49%) NDErs and 147 (44.6%) non-NDErs for a   total of 347 narrative responses.&nbsp; Narrative answers were categorized and scored   the same way as the narrative explanations for the healing survey discussed   above and limited to only those answers that could be considered in the context   of healing.

RESULTS

The meaning of   healing holds the key to how people answered the survey questions.&nbsp; Out of 124   NDErs, 112 (90.32%) answered the question.&nbsp; Out of 75 non-NDErs, 68 (90.67%)   answered the question, 'What does healing mean to you?'

Not surprisingly,   most people understand healing to be a function of making the body well.&nbsp;   However, many expressed healing in emotional, mental, and spiritual terms.&nbsp;   Others used holistic healing concepts of balance, acceptance, and removal of   negativity.&nbsp; Another expressed concept of healing is in helping others to heal.&nbsp;

There is   probably no statistical significance between the NDErs and the non-NDErs who   report abilities now or changes after their experience.&nbsp; The chi square p-value   for Y/N/U is .0853 and for Y/N/U/NR is .0277 for those reporting healing   abilities after the experience.&nbsp; The question asked was, 'Did   you personally have any healing ability (your ability to heal others) after your   NDE?'&nbsp;    Of note, 56.78% of NDErs and 45.07% of   non-NDErs answered 'yes.'&nbsp; It is also surprising that so many people reported a   change in their abilities, with NDErs reporting 41.53% and non-NDErs reporting a   38.03% change.&nbsp; All but 3 of the reported changes were in the direction of   healing abilities afterwards.

When participants   were asked, 'Have you used your healing abilities to heal another   person?' 97 (78.2%) NDErs and 53 (70.1%) non-NDErs responded.&nbsp; Of   those respondents, 57 (58.8%) NDErs and 28 (52.8%) non-NDErs gave examples or   comments.&nbsp; The comments consisted of the following:

Participants were   asked, 'Have you ever experienced any physical healing that you   attribute to your experience?'&nbsp; What is most intriguing about this question is   that it was one of the last questions.&nbsp; We expected the evidential physical   healing to be answered in the question about whether the respondent had ever   healed anyone.&nbsp; Surprisingly, this is the place where the 'miracle' stories of   healings occurred.&nbsp; A total of 103 (83.1%) NDErs and 67 (89.3%) non-NDErs   responded.&nbsp; Of the responders, 46 (44.7%) NDErs and 23 (34.3%) non-NDErs gave   explanations or examples.&nbsp;

Participants were   asked, 'Did you have any psychic, paranormal or other special gifts following   the experience you did not have prior to the experience?'&nbsp; Of the 315 NDErs and   330 non-NDErs, paranormal gifts were reported by 151 (51.36%) of NDErs and 92   (32.51%) of non-NDErs.&nbsp; Those who had not experienced paranormal gifts are 96   (32.65%) of the NDErs and 132 (46.64%) of the non-NDErs.&nbsp; Out of the total of   294 NDErs and 283 NDErs who responded to the question, 47 (15.99%) of NDErs and   59 (20.85%) of non-NDErs were uncertain if they had paranormal gifts or not.

The chi square   analysis shows a statistical significance that the difference in paranormal   gifts between NDErs and non-NDErs is not due to chance alone.&nbsp; The p-values for   paranormal gifts was 'Y/N' .000282, 'Y/N/U' .2.534E-05, and 'Y/N/U/NR'   8.596E-07.&nbsp; NDErs have a stronger likelihood to report paranormal gifts and are   less likely to be uncertain about what they are calling 'paranormal gifts.'&nbsp;   Contrarily, non-NDErs who report paranormal events are less likely to attribute   any of their abilities to 'paranormal gifts.' Furthermore, the non-NDE group was   more uncertain about what paranormal gifts might be than the NDErs.

Of those participants   who gave a narrative response to paranormal gifts, those who discussed healing   or healing-related gifts were categorized.&nbsp; Participant comments to paranormal   gifts and pertaining to healing can be divided into two groups:&nbsp; 1) Those who   give emotional support and; 2) those who do physical healing.&nbsp;

Participants were   asked about substance sensitivities after their experience.&nbsp; The question read,   'After your experience did you become more sensitive to medications?'   There were 114 (91.9%) of NDErs responded to the question with 62 (38.2%) of   those who gave examples or explained their response.&nbsp; Likewise, 68 (90.7%)   non-NDErs responded to the question with 26 (38.2%) of those who gave examples   or explained their response.&nbsp; The chi square value between NDErs and non-NDErs   is probably statistically significant with a p-value of .0533.&nbsp; Allergies to   drugs, even over the counter drugs, are the most commonly reported substance   sensitivities.&nbsp; Interestingly, most of the NDE substance sensitivities were to   pain relievers, over-the-counter cold remedies, and to a lesser extent,   prescribed medications.

Dr. Long proposed a   mini-study within the healing study to look at researcher bias.&nbsp; His proposal   consisted of a scoring system from 0-5 for the evidentiality of the healing   event when participants were asked if they had healed anyone, and if so how.&nbsp;   Letter modifiers from a through d were added that described whether the   narratives could be medically explicable.&nbsp;

When I started to   evaluate the information based upon the criteria, I could not ignore the   emotional healing aspect contained in narrative responses.&nbsp; So, I added a   modifier and called it 'e' for emotional.&nbsp; As it turned out, 'e' was the only   modifier that I used.&nbsp; I did not want to say anything to Dr. Long to bias how he   was scoring the answers.&nbsp; Another difference was that he created a category of   'need more information.'&nbsp; I took them literally and if I could not tell from the   answer, it was scored as a 0, 'insufficient information to even guess.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Out of a total of 85   answers, I found 28 (32.9%) with insufficient information to guess, 8 (9.4%)   minimally suggestive of evidentiality, 14 (16.5%) mild suggestion of   evidentiality, 20 (23.5%) moderate suggestion of evidentiality, 12 (14.1%)   marked suggestion of evidentiality, and 3 (3.5%) as convincingly evidential.&nbsp;   Dr. Long, on the other hand, found 12 (14.1%) where he needed more information,   20 (23.5%) with insufficient information to guess, 7 (8.2%) minimally suggestive   of evidentiality, 14 (16.5%) mild suggestion of evidentiality, 6 (7.1%) moderate   suggestion of evidentiality, 4 (4.7%) marked suggestion of evidentiality, and 0   (3.5%) as convincingly evidential.&nbsp; My threshold of evidentiality was much lower   than Dr. Long's.&nbsp; I created a modifier to fit the emotional healing aspect of   the data.&nbsp; Dr. Long defined the initial parameters of the study and stayed   fairly consistent within those parameters.

DISCUSSION

How researchers and   survey participants view 'healing' and its efficacy depends on how they define   'healing.'&nbsp; Some people narrowly define healing in terms of the physical body,   while others use the word 'healing' to encompass healing the earth and the   universe.&nbsp; Ultimately, those who have a more holistic view of healing will be   much more accepting of alternative medicine; while those with a narrower view of   healing will be less accepting of alternative medicine.&nbsp; Those with a narrower   viewpoint will demand miracles to prove the efficacy of alternative medicine.&nbsp;   While those with a more holistic viewpoint, tend not to care about validating   the healing experience.&nbsp; Inherently, the discrepancy between the two viewpoints   makes it difficult to physically test alternative healing.&nbsp; An experimental   design that would be considered scientifically valid, many times may not take   into account the nature of how healing energy may work.&nbsp; The crux of a   successful healing study is one in which there is open communication between   those who heal and those who test.&nbsp; There are also ethical dilemmas and possible   liability for medical establishments who allow testing.&nbsp;

Much of the   confusion, and ergo tension, between the medical field and the alternative   medical field may have a lot to do with the way that people perceive healing and   health.&nbsp; And, after reviewing survey results, it is also clear that living in   the face of one's mortality or immortality may well be a large factor in how   people perceive health.&nbsp; The confidence that people place in doctors as opposed   to alternative medicine may well be an extension of a core belief system rather   than an isolated incident.&nbsp; For instance, rather than healing being confined to   just physical body healing, many people answered that healing consisted of a   positive way of life.

It is noteworthy to   delve into some of the issues of alternative healing as opposed to conventional   medicine.&nbsp; By looking at these issues one can get an idea of the two opposing   belief systems and possible underlying causes.&nbsp; These are then compared and   contrasted with survey answers on what NDErs and non-NDErs think.&nbsp;

Much of alternative   medicine is really part of a 30 billion dollar industry that has no scientific   proof of the efficacy of the alternative remedy. (Cowley, 2002, p. 48)&nbsp; It is   small wonder that the medical community, in general, balks at alternative   healing in view of the fact that so many people have fatal belief systems.&nbsp;   Although many alternative medicine healers may claim to heal such diseases as   cancer, there is no proof that healing was solely due to the intervention of the   alternative healer.&nbsp; Dr. Long is a radiation oncologist and routinely uses   radiation to treat cancer.&nbsp; In his practice, there is one word for those   diagnosed with cancer who rely solely on alternative medicine ' that word is   'dead.'&nbsp; He refers to this method of treatment as a 'fatal belief system.'

On the other hand,   those who are more inclined to believe in alternative medicine have a point   about medical care.&nbsp; Many medical professionals try to accommodate patients,   'Doctors are as unhappy as patients about the current state of health care, and   most are eager to make it more caring and humane' (Cowley, p. 48).&nbsp; Alternative medicine   may be viewed as more approachable because it fills this niche, perceived as   lacking in routine medical care.&nbsp; Regular health care is expensive to those   without health insurance.&nbsp; Moreover, for those with little or no health care   coverage and a serious illness, alternative medicine may be considered cheaper   than diagnostic medicine.&nbsp;

Alternative medicine   may be part of a mystical belief system that if the mind or spirit is healed,   then healing of the body will follow.&nbsp; Herbs and other remedies take on added   properties by being categorized as 'natural' healing remedies and may work more   as a placebo than to have any real healing properties.&nbsp; One contributing factor   is that liability is too great for those products that might really work.&nbsp; For   instance, the Chinese herb ma huang has ephedrine that can help with breathing difficulties.&nbsp;   However, it was almost obliterated from the over-the-counter market because it   supposedly caused kidney damage and heart attacks.&nbsp; Comfrey root really did work   for soothing upper respiratory problems during a cold.&nbsp; It was promptly removed   from the market.&nbsp; $30 billion dollars of public exploitation raises some serious   questions about who really profits from the alternative medicine belief system.

In survey results, it   is interesting that the majority of NDErs (40%) attributed healing to physically   making the body better.&nbsp; On the other hand, making the body better was not the   only aspect of healing that most NDErs mentioned.&nbsp; Mental, emotional, and   spiritual healing was also a part of healing.&nbsp; Conversely, the largest category   mentioned for non-NDErs (37%) regarding the meaning of healing was the holistic   category.&nbsp; The holistic category consists of concepts dealing with making the   body/mind/spirit whole by maintaining balance, accepting limitations, easing   pain, and removing negativity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Although there are   numerous ways to look at the charts above, it is striking how the answers are so   similar.&nbsp; Healing, as defined by survey participants, was consistent whether the   question was specifically about healing or if healing was explained as part of   paranormal gifts.&nbsp; Interestingly, the impact of this study is not contained in   any one question.&nbsp; Rather, the answers to all the questions point to the same   conclusion.

Participant answers   pertaining to healing can be divided into two groups:&nbsp; 1) Those who give   emotional support and; 2) those who perform physical healing.&nbsp; The manner of   physical healing usually has to do with hot hands.&nbsp; They describe it in various   ways, such as hands on healing, the laying of hands, or channeling energy.&nbsp;   Frequently, the description of physical healing includes elements of prayer,   visualization, and guidance from a higher source.&nbsp; From the answers, there seems   to be a transfer of energy, primarily through the hands.&nbsp; There are elements   that the recipient be receptive to the energy transfer and that the giver of the   energy be sensitive enough to direct the energy appropriately.&nbsp; Many will   connect to spirit either by directly praying for divine intervention or by   altering their mental state to be more receptive to energy transfer.&nbsp;   Ironically, this connection is that which makes us immortal, yet it is directed   at the physical, earthly body.&nbsp;

Many participants   define healing in the context of emotional healing.&nbsp; The most frequently   mentioned category for emotional healing contains the concept of continuity of   life and the loss of fear of death.&nbsp; A high percentage of both NDErs and   non-NDErs also define emotional healing as peace and more relaxed about life.&nbsp;   Another large category is that participants use descriptive words such as   empathy, feelings, emotions, intuition, expanded awareness, and love.&nbsp; The   expanded awareness of being able to feel other peoples' feelings helps the   person to be able to say the right thing for healing to occur.&nbsp; My two favorite   phrases illustrating this point come from Lora and Sam.&nbsp; Sam writes, 'Sometimes   I think I may have the ability to heal people by touching them. I have worked as   a counselor to terminally ill children and I think my experience (though I never   mention it to them) has helped me by giving me a very sacred view of death.'   Lora tells us, 'I'd never experienced such INTENSITY of feeling before, and I am   now more sensitive to the feelings of others...almost as if I can feel what they   are feeling. Since I teach disturbed kids now, it has a very strong purpose.'&nbsp;

Dr. Long's definition   of healing is, 'To restore toward health by reducing or eliminating a physical,   emotional or spiritual imperfection' and based on experience with his medical   practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When asked if reading the narratives changed his mind on his   definition, he answered, 'no.'&nbsp; In contrast, my definition of healing was part   of the holistic category and based on personal experience.&nbsp; I am familiar with   many techniques of healing, including Reiki.&nbsp; However, after reading the   narratives, my definition of healing has changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I would have to say   that my definition of healing has changed to that which moves us closer to God,   a reconnection to God as it were.&nbsp; Essentially, the definition is synonymous   with spiritual growth.&nbsp; Emotional healing spreads love and acceptance of self   and others.&nbsp; Physical healing does not necessarily heal the mind, emotions, or   spirit.&nbsp; Further, just because a person has a physical handicap doesn't make   that handicap an imperfection or necessarily something that needs to be healed.&nbsp;   For example, my asthma may not be considered a handicap if I accept my physical   limitations.&nbsp; Only if I turned my anger inward at the fact I can't jog would   this handicap become something that needed healing ' and that would be on an   emotional or mental level.&nbsp; In fact, having asthma may be one of the reasons   that I am so empathic towards other people.&nbsp;

I was touched by the   number of people who indicated that they refused to take medicine because if it   was their time to go, so what?&nbsp; Physical healing may preserve the body on earth,   but in the light of spirit and the continuity of life, it is the spiritual,   mental, and emotional that we take with us when the body dies.&nbsp; Thinking of   healing in the context of immortality or mortality, are two very different   approaches towards a subjective definition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The most amazing   discoveries of this study, in my opinion, surround emotional healing.&nbsp; Both   NDErs and non-NDErs considered healing to be the bringing of peace into their   life or becoming a more relaxed individual.&nbsp; The surprising part is that both   groups considered the discovery of the continuity of life and losing the fear of   dying as significantly emotionally healing.&nbsp; Likewise, the discovery of God and   understanding a universal purpose for life and suffering on earth gave them   emotional healing.&nbsp; According to George Gallup, Jr. in the book 'Surveying the   Religious Landscape,' these very issues are the primary reasons that people join   groups and churches (Gallup, 1999, pp. 91-92).&nbsp; The implications, from the   answers to emotional healing, are staggering on a socio/religious level and   beyond the scope of this paper.&nbsp; However, we could modify our approach to   medical and psychological health and probably heal more people by incorporating   the new understandings.

From the survey   results there is something happening with what some would call 'alternative   healing.'&nbsp; Hands-on-healing, visualization, and prayer exist as a viable means   of healing.&nbsp; Although conventional medicine may rightly assert little or no hard   evidence exists, they can't discount that something is happening.&nbsp; The only   question may be where these 'healing gifts' fall within whose definition of   healing.

One thing that   everyone can agree on is that healing is a subjective matter.&nbsp; What this survey   shows is the amazing diversity in approaches to healing and to the definition of   healing.&nbsp; Answers to questions pertaining to healing will necessarily be how   each individual defines the term 'healing.'&nbsp; Healing practices will depend on   particular belief systems that are not necessarily confined to just physical   healing.&nbsp; Consequently, despite the subjectivity inherent in the definition of   healing, healing has many forms but is only a part of one universal purpose.&nbsp;   Ironically, looking at health through the lens of mortality, that universal   purpose is to reconnect us with our own immortality.

&nbsp;[1]    Dr. Jeffrey Long developed an   Excel based chi-square calculation engine based on over 2,000 data points.&nbsp;   Calculations are automatically updated when new data are added.&nbsp; This methodology   shows whether the statistical difference in two groups is due to more than   chance alone.&nbsp; Here, the p-value between the expected and observed values was   highly significant with p = 8.51E-12.
