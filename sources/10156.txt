  		              		Experience Description   

  My father had died of a heart attack in 1988 and my mum started drinking heavily. My sister and I were raised with our parents. I was age 7 when my dad died and his was the first spirit I saw at age 7. After seeing my dad's spirit I started seeing another spirit. He was scary for me to look at because he looked like a skeleton Pirate. He would always show up when I was afraid. I was not raised  on religion. My grandfather was a minister of Ringatu, a branch of Christianity and one of two main Maori religions in New Zealand. The other branch was  Ratana. The sermons were always done in Te Reo Maori and I am not a speaker of my native tongue, sadly. So whatever my Koro was preaching, was lost on me because I didn't understand the language. My mum met my stepdad in 1990 and we moved to Cambridge in December 1991. I had no friends, cousins, family or pets. It was just me. My sister stayed behind until l mid-1992 and then she moved back with us. I went from a 52 blood-related students in our school  to a 500+ non-related students in school. I had never experienced different cultures except I did see them on TV. I didn't come from money or stature, just common folk who farmed for a living. I was raised on a farm in the middle of the biggest forest in New Zealand where our food was fresh  for my family.  
  
  At age  13,  I  started smoking weed. I was smoking the butts of two joints with my sisters and their friends. It was like the second time I had smoked a joint in my life and I was trying to be older and impress.  We were all sitting in the lounge and were stoned.  I decided that I was going to make some toast. I was standing at the oven and my sisters came in asking me who I was talking to and I said 'I'm not talking at all.' They laughed and assured me  I was talking. That's when everything went black.
  
  I came to and saw my sisters and two friends dragging me to the bathroom and over the bathtub. They were pouring water onto my head. I could hear them saying that I hadn't eaten anything and my sister was mad at me, demanding that I wake up. I slurred and watched them put me onto my bed. I was rolling from side to side. It is then that I realize that I am up above everyone watching from the ceiling. Then I was pulled upwards. I saw my house, then my street, then my city,  then New Zealand, and then the world. Next  I saw stars in a black tunnel but the stars are white lines, like I was in hyper-drive in space movies. I was going REALLY, REALLY fast and the noise is so LOUD, sounding like a WHOOSH or a train.

  I stopped and was floating in space. I see star clusters and space clouds.  The colors are sooooo wonderfully bright. I am on what feels like an escalator.  I am aware of a HUGE Being beside me and  I am holding his left little fingertip with my hand. He is so bright and  wearing a white robe.  I can only see the cuff of his sleeve. We come to a Glass Room and I can still see the view of space when I close my eyes now. I am dressed in white and  on my knees with a huge screen in front of me. There are little screens showing me moving pictures but not of my life. I know this isn't my life review. I know that I am not in heaven. The Being of light is behind me with his hands on my shoulders as I watch all the destruction and rage of humanity while they destroy each other and the world, over and over again. I saw so much hatred and bad scenes that it stuck with me after this. I looked to both, my left and right, and there are thousands and thousands, if not, millions of us watching our screens with our Being of light behind us. 

  I stood up and I face my Being of Light. He is so magnificently greater than me. He told me that its time for me to remember because I have a job to do.  I promised him that 'I won't do it again.' He pushed me from the room and I started falling toward the darkness of space.  I went through the tunnel again.  I saw the world, then New Zealand, then my city, then my street, then my roof. Then I saw myself on my bed. I was still rolling side-to-side repeating, 'I won't do it again' both in my head and from my mouth. Then I slammed into my body and sat up straight, remembering everything that I have just told here.

  I didn't tell anyone about this for years. When I did mention it to my sisters in 1999/2000, they told me something that freaks me out to this day.   They both told me that during my blackout, I came out of the bedroom,  walked around the kitchen. They told me that I was touching everything and touching their faces saying, 'I'm dead! I'm not even here. I'm up there!' while I was point upwards. I kept touching my sisters faces crying, laughing, getting mad, crying, laughing, angry all at the same time, repeating the same words over and over.

  When I came back, I was changed. I lost interest in life and started sleeping a lot. I started  reading self-help books and self-realization books. I found that I could  tell when people were sick,  lying or dying. I could feel things that I couldn't see. My mind would exploded into the world and my passion for research, truth, paranormal and supernatural gifts was born.

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I told my sisters 7 years later and they confirmed my experience by telling me what they saw me doing. They immediately believed me and always have supported me through my journey to self. I was always the sister going through trials and tribulations that the world wasn't ready for. I always felt alone in my experiences. They didn't start listening to me until their gifts came through. After we all had kids.  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     It was real. I remember the sounds and the sights; the clarity of details is still with me to this day 24 years later.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     To this day I know it was real and it was necessary. It helped me to find my place in this world and hopefully the next.  
  
  At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   Chemical overwhelm. I inhaled some puffs of an asthma pump and I was sitting down. The next thing I know I was standing by myself watching me black out on my seat and then I was back in my body.
