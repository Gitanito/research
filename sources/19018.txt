what einstein called the spooky effect
everybody know what spooky effect is
well einstein observed that a particle
being could be in two places at once
like that the same thing
and so he couldn&#39;t really explain it he
just called it spooky
but it&#39;s not spooky when you think about
it the whole cosmos is actually
non-local because it&#39;s conscious
a few years ago there was a journal
a physics journal that published it was
actually on the front page of newsweek
it was back in the late 80s early 90s
where they did a study
and what they were doing is that they
were studying photons and
shooting them down
an area and they would there would be an
aperture or window that it would go
through
but what happened is that physicists
found
that when they thought of where they
were going to move
the photons changed course
precognitively
in other words the photons reacted
with the thought and consciousness and
intent of the physicists
and this was done over and over again
and proven this is published in
mainstream physics journals
but people say oh well that&#39;s
interesting well i don&#39;t know what it
means they chuck to the side
this is in the mainstream physics
journals you look this study up
and then of course you have people like
dr bob john
of princeton princeton engineering
anomalies research lab
pure lab and back in the 90s he and i
spoke about this he says you know what
you&#39;re doing out under the stars is
sort of in a clinical experiential way
what i&#39;m proving in the lab
and that is that everything is conscious
everything can react to thought
consciousness
you
