  		              		Experience Description   

    I was in a very well-lit place together with other persons in a festive and joyful atmosphere. 
  
   I had no recollection of a life on this earth.    I only felt a great feeling of wellness and freedom.
   
  Then I heard an inner voice telling me that  I must go away. So  I was determined to leave. I tried to leave that party without being noticed.
  
  One of the persons saw me and  asked me,  'Are you going?'
  
  I answered,  'I must go.'
  
  With a  worried look, he replied, 'If you have to, go . . .'
  
  In front of me there were many doors. I didn't know which one to choose. Eventually, I chose one and got into it.
  
  I was in a  tunnel that was full of colors. I was moving at an impressive speed rate.
  
  I remember the moment I entered into my brain and I said, 'Oh no! I am back here!'
  
  The opening within me closed up and there was no way to go back.

  I realized that the mind is a claustrophobic and painful prison. I understood that consciousness  and brain are two different things. Emotions belong to the brain and not to the soul. The feeling of being restrained was truly claustrophobic.
  
  Then I said to myself, 'Now I need to understand what I must do.'  I went towards my eyes, where I could feel a dim light. 

I woke up outside the surgery room and I took to cry ceaselessly, like newborns into this world do.
