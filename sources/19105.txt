my name is Chuck Charles I went in the
military Air Force and in 1954 retired
1974 it&#39;s a tech sergeant most of time I
was an air traffic controller
I&#39;ve been at Edwards Air Force Base in
California I&#39;ve been Japan Thailand
Alaska several bases in the States this
event happened and October the 7th of
1965 today is the year 2000 so it&#39;s 35
years ago it was on a midnight shift I
was here traffic controller on duty in
the tower and about 1:30 or so in the
morning I noticed this real bright light
to the east of my field and it was
commonly about light green I would
describe it and it had a red light
underneath it and the red light it
wasn&#39;t actually a flashing light it&#39;s
kind of nice a pulsating type probably
be a better description of it red
underneath and and had a white like
light on top that just glowed and it was
very bright and it&#39;s quite large so I
observed it for quite a while because it
wasn&#39;t any aircraft in the air at the
time and so I called the dispatcher down
to base operation and the weather man
that was on duty that night forecaster
and and that and got him all the glass
side and take a look yeah how it is that
you know and and I had the one of the
attachment guys from the interceptor
detachment that was on the base there
had the captain down there got him a
Blake and got him to go out and look at
it yeah what is that you know and so we
talked about for a while
rapcon people that&#39;s radar people that
own the base they didn&#39;t have any
aircraft in the area at the time
and so we got called it down to the air
defense people at all times our defense
sector and the director down there
decided he got trolled around his site
and at one point in time they had at
least four different radar sites that
were getting radar returns on he&#39;s
saying they were getting seen at a
couple other towers like George Tower
so we&#39;re Victorville and I don&#39;t
remember now a couple other places there
that we&#39;re seeing him so there was
several people on the ground looking at
these things and about four radar sites
so this goes back and forth and back and
forth for oh I don&#39;t know two three
hours and they finally decided to
scramble an aircraft on it to go up and
take a look at it and this was
coordinated but the other higher
headquarters and I think NORAD was
involved in everybody so anyway we got
into the scramble scramble his aircraft
oh and he goes up to take a look at it
and they tried to run him intercept on
these targets and at the at the very
beginning I had won the big large but at
some time later it was just setting
their most mostly stationary but it was
too close to the horizon to be a star or
anything like that it was down below the
mountain of the hills and stuff so it
wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t a star I thought
couldn&#39;t couldn&#39;t correlate for what it
what it possibly could be and then all
of a sudden there&#39;s like three more
objects and they had similar
characteristics as far as their lighting
is concerned but these three stayed like
together they stayed like I don&#39;t know
if they were formation or or what it was
but anyway these three stayed together
and then they moved they stayed there
for a little bit and they move down to
the south of me and set for their set to
our stationary why
and in a little bit later on there&#39;s
three more appears but these three are
individual ones they would fly
individually around and go north south
east west and other things and hit so at
this point I had like seven of them at
one time and so this is one they decided
to do the scrambled business it was
getting on way up in the in the early
morning hours for that time and they got
the aircraft up and they tried to run a
intercept on him and it was having no
luck and so I they kept asking me in the
tower or where was this object in
relation the airplane and the only thing
I could do was line him up with my
runway where I knew what heading he was
on for sure in relation to where I was
and then as soon as he get the end of
the runway I tell him to turn to a
certain heading and head straight for it
well about three different times that
night he was able to he&#39;d say contact
and that contact means he had contact
with something in his on his radar in
the cockpit of the aircraft and what it
was we don&#39;t know to this day one point
in time he was up to 40,000 feet and
when he went near the object the object
this rose real fast real sudden and
quick and fast and he just went under it
and there&#39;s a place on the take where
the director says no how&#39;s he looking
tower and I said he&#39;s low and he said
well he&#39;s at 40,000 feet nice I don&#39;t
care he still low and that thing just
went way high and they searched on their
radar the height finders and everything
for it and I highly suspect it was above
their radars at that point so probably a
hundred thousand feet or something like
that
lady to a hundred thousand feet was
probably their capability back in those
days but he did have contact about three
different times Nina losing but these
these objects played around there for
the remainder of the misshaped and as
long about daylight and started getting
daylight they started getting higher and
higher and higher and in the atmosphere
out in the air and by the time it was
light enough that you wouldn&#39;t see the
rest of stars they were gone too they
would just like want to right away like
a like a start and they just disappeared
into the into the atmosphere I know a
lot of things this was not I know it was
not a helicopter I know it was not an
airplane I know it was not a balloon of
weather blend or any other type of thing
and I know it was no known aircraft
flying object that we know of today or
at that time and it wasn&#39;t a laser show
it wasn&#39;t anything like that but they
could move real fast they could move
from the east they could be to the east
of my field and in just a short period
of time they could be to the west they
could be they could probably go 3040
miles and time you can snap your fingers
twice I mean just fast and they could
rise just go straight up they could do
that just seemed like instantaneous fast
at some points in time when they would
set and just sit for a long long period
of time and then they would move and
then seem like those three individual
ones the smaller three individual ones
they&#39;ve done a lot more movement than
the other one that the the original one
didn&#39;t move all that much it it moved it
finally after a couple of hours or so it
moved a little bit from the east down to
a little bit toward the south and moved
back toward the east a little bit again
and like that but it didn&#39;t make any
sudden fast movements until they tried
to run the intercept then it went
straight up and then there was the three
level what the three that was flying
around individually they would dart
north to south east to west and they the
ones that really went fast and and they
were the ones that were actually nearer
to the surface you know and Erik near to
the ground I&#39;m judging being an air
traffic control I I had to judge
altitude a lot because and and like my
traffic pattern altitude for a jet
aircraft there was like 2,000 feet and
there was points where they were below
like what would be my traffic pattern
altitude so there were there were times
that they were below 2,000 feet there
were other times that they were a lot a
lot higher than that and I know that
they were getting some of the radar cuts
on them high finder cuts if anywhere
from four to ten eleven thousand feet so
that&#39;s pretty low to the surface they
had to be something that would return a
radar signal and and that would have to
be something metallic but in order radar
is a very simple thing in it&#39;s a radio
beam that has to hit something in return
bounce off of something and come back so
it had to be something would bounce off
of and it wouldn&#39;t bounce off of a
rubber balloon or anything like that it
would have to be something of a metallic
nature that would cause it to bounce
back and make a indication on your radar
screen it would have to be in the
thousands up in that area the speed wise
that these things could move would have
to be very very fast and the radar
people was having a hard time
determining any speed on them because
they would be one place and it&#39;s set for
a little while and they&#39;d move real fast
and then time the radar screen got
around to painting him there&#39;s already
at the there other locations you know
and so it was it was very difficult to
get any kind of a speed on them but they
were fast very very quick you could be
watching one of these
and if you looked around for a little
bit your attention was diverted
someplace else for just a minute you
look around and he&#39;d be over in the West
and you can see you could actually see
them going it wasn&#39;t like they
disappeared and Rhema T realized or
something they were visible the whole
the whole time but they would go very
very rapidly they could make quick turns
they could they just had they had all
sorts of maneuverability that we didn&#39;t
know anything about the time and it was
a very strange evening so we&#39;re looking
at at at least a four hour time frame
that we were messing around with these
things in those days every base had what
to call a youthful officer not
unidentified flying object officers and
we had one Oh networks and he had to be
the guy that actually gave the order
yeah I&#39;d like to take a look at this
thing in other words the the people that
the air defense sector down lad and the
radar which is the radar P from that and
they wanted to take a look at what they
had to more or less get his say-so
before they could go ahead and do it
legally so they rousted him out of the
bed at wee hours and he gave him
permission to yeah he&#39;d like to take a
look at so that&#39;s how kind of me
come around to getting a scramble off at
that point in time we had a Edwards Air
Force Base there was a rocket what we
call the rocket site and they were
messing around that there was a whole
lot of different fuel combinations and
doing a lot of rocket burns and stuff
over just to see what thrust they could
get and doing all kind of tests and from
my standpoint that looks like just about
where he was sitting just about over
that rocket site and
I mean that just pretty much where he
was that rocket site from the tower from
my vantage point was to the rocket site
was probably 10 miles across the dry
lakebed
the f-106 that they did scramble at
night was a cold what they call the cold
bird he wasn&#39;t armed in any way of just
a normal aircraft I&#39;ve heard times guys
talk about they have seen things and
that but for the things I&#39;ve just
mentioned they they wouldn&#39;t necessarily
come forward and say what they had seen
because they didn&#39;t want the the stigma
attached to but they were crazy or they
were seeing things or they didn&#39;t want
the ribbing that they were going to get
from their buddies and the Air Defense
people could not admit that they didn&#39;t
couldn&#39;t defend us so there you are the
tape that that was used to make the tape
that&#39;s in existence now of the incident
that night was really radio patches and
telephone patches that was recorded at
the various radar sites and that was
involved in this thing there would be
another tape as well someplace that
would be from the tower that I was in
because everything that was going on in
the tower is recorded and there would
been a recording of that at the most
that most of the objects that I saw at
any one time was seven there was there
was one large one and there was three
smaller ones with the same type
characteristics but these three kind of
stayed together and then they were at
the certain point after this and there
was three other ones that were flying
around like individually but at one
point in time I had as many as seven
visually at one time I&#39;m hearing the
tapes and everything now I hear that
they might have been as many as 11 in
the area somewhere that night I can&#39;t
tell you what it was
I have no other I can tell you a lot of
things it was and it wasn&#39;t anything
that we know of today that can fly I
have those type of characteristics to do
the maneuvers and do the speeds with no
sound that I heard anything like and
certain points in time they were close
enough to the tower that if it had been
a jet or something I heard the sound
from it and because I can you know but
as far as being able to tell you what it
was I cannot do I wish I knew
you
you
