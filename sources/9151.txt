I was in the intensive care unit, stretched out on my bed in the hospital. 
  				    
  On this morning I felt like I was in a daze as I lifted up from my bed.  I rose up to the ceiling and  saw myself lying in my bed. Both nurses who were taking care of me were panic stricken, but I didn't hear what they were talking about. I entered very quickly into a white tunnel. I was rapidly advancing towards a very intense light.   I had the feeling of floating with a sense of well-being.

Suddenly, I sensed a slap in my face.  I woke  up in my bed with my wife crying at my side. The hospital contacted her in the morning  to quickly come to the hospital. The phenomenon lasted from 9:00 am  until  I woke up at 6:00 pm. On the other hand, I didn't see anybody in the tunnel and I didn't hear anything, but I had a feeling of intense happiness. There are days when I regret coming back, and I can't stop thinking about the experience, as I still have serious health issues. I would have liked to go to the end of the tunnel.
