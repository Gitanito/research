DISCOURS PRESIDENTIEL
DE Monsieur Camille Flammarion
Fondateur et premier President de la Socii^Ti AsTRONOMiiiUE
DE France,
Directeur de I'Observatoire de Juvisy,
Coramandeur de la Legion d'Hoiineur.
Mbsdames, Messieurs, Chers Collegues.
MoN plus vif desir eut ete de me rendre personnellement
aupres de vous pour vous presenter mes profonds et
sympathiques remerciements de I'honneur que vient de me
faire la celebre Society for Psychical Research, mais il
me serait extremement difficile de m'eloigner en ce moment
de Paris et de Juvisy, et je tiens tout d'abord a vous
en exprimer mes tres sinceres regrets. Heureusement,
nous pouvons converser ensemble, de loin comme de
pres, et, en reahte, je suis aupres de vous, par I'esprit
et par le coeur.
J'ai lu un grand nombre de discours academiques, et
notamment les 24 que la Psychical Society a pubhes
dans son beau volume des Presidential Addresses, et j'ai

constate qu'en general celui qui a rhonneur d'etre reQU
dans le cenacle d'une illustre Societe commence son
discours de reception en exprimant son humble recon-
naissance d'etre admis dans une compagnie dont il n'est
pas digne. Ce serait assurement mon devoir particulier
ici, plus que pour aucun de mes predecesseurs, puisque je
suis, avec mon savant ami Charles Richet et avec le
philosophe Henri Bergson, I'un des rares etrangers qui
ont ete appeles a cette presidence, depuis 41 ans que votre
Societe existe. J'avoue que je suis un peu ebloui par
votre constellation d'astres de premiere grandeur, oti
brillent les noms de William Crookes, de Balfour Stewart,
d'Arthur Balfour, de WilHam James, d'Oliver Lodge, de
William Barrett, de Frederic Myers, d'Henry Sidgwick, de
Gerald Balfour et de leurs emules.
Parmi ces discours, la premiere phrase de celui du
spirituel philosophe William James m'a particulierement
frappe, parce qu'elle repondait exactement a mon im-
pression lorsque votre eminent fondateur et ancien presi-
dent Sir William Barrett est venu dans ma retraite
d'astronome solitaire me proposer cet honneur assurement
inattendu. J'y ai repondu, comme Sir Oliver Lodge en
1901 :
" It is the wish of your Council," mais en ajoutant,
comme William James, en 1896, que c'etait la . . . un
piege a souris, " a mouse-trap," et que quand on y
entre on est pris, sans se douter de ce qui vous arrive !
Ai-je une excuse de m'etre laisse prendre 1 Peut-etre.
L'annee meme oil cette Societe de Recherches a ete
fondee—en 1882—j'ai fonde moi-meme, en France, I'As-
tronomie. Revue des Recherches astronomiques, d'oii est
sortie, cinq ans apres, la Societe Astronomique de
France, ou j'ai eu comme successeurs a la presidence les
plus celebres astronomes de I'lnstitut, Faye, Janssen,
Tisserand, Callandreau, Poincare, LipjDmann, Deslandres,
Baillaud, Puiseux, Appell, savants illustres, dignes d'etre
compares aux gloires de votre Conseil. En meme temps
que vous, je travaillais done a la fondation d'une oeuvre
ayant pour mission d'elever les hommes au-dessus des
interets materiels et de les inviter a vivre dans la con-
templation de I'infini.
LXXXix.] Discours Presidentiel.
Animes du nieme esprit, nous voulions, vous comme moi,
le progres et le developpement des connaissances humaines,
sachant que :
Croire tout decouvert est une erreur profonde ;
Cast prendre I'horizon pour les bornes du monde.
Peut-etre me rattachai-je a vous par des liens encore
plus anciens. En 1869, vos predecesseurs en recherches
psychiques avaient fonde a Londres la Societe dialectique,
avec le concours de Alfred Russel Wallace, de I'ingenieur
Varley, du Prof. De Morgan, de William Crookes, qui
me demanda un article astronomique pour son Qtiarterly
Journal of Science, et precisement aussi, en cette meme
annee, pronon9ant un discours, le jour de ses obseques,
siir la tombe d'Allan Kardec, grand maitre du Spiritisme
en France, j'ai pris soin de dire que le spiritisme ne
doit pas etre considere comme une religion, mais repre-
sente I'aurore d'une science nouvelle, tout entiere a
creer. L'affaire de la science n'est pas la croyance,
mais I'investigation.
Ainsi, mes chers CoUegues, il me semble que nous
sommes freres depuis longtemps et que nous marchons la
main dans la main.
Un souvenir plus ancien encore se rappeUe en ce
moment a ma pensee. En 1861, j'etais eleve astronome
a rObservatoire de Paris, et je passais tous les jours
pres de I'Odeon, pour revenir au domicile de mes parents
habitant I'interieiu" de Paris, et comme tous les amateurs
de livreSj je m'arretais sous les galeries de ce theatre pour
feuilleter les publications interessantes. J'en ouvre une,
et mes yeux tombent sur une page portant pour titre
Pluralite des mondes. Or, precisement, a cette epoque,
je travaillais a mon ouvrage sur ce sujet, public I'annee
suivante. Je regarde le titre du volume et je lis Le
Livre des Esprits, par Allan Kardec. Le chapitre qui
m'interessait etait presente comme " dicte par des Es-
prits." Cette enigme pouvait intriguer un etudiant de 19
ans. J'allai rendre visite a I'auteur, qui m'inscrivit (le
15 Novembre 1861) dans sa Societe parisienne des Etudes
Ispirites, et j'assistai aux reunions hebdomadaires ou
s'exer9aient diverses formes de mediumnite, notamment
4 Camille Flammarion. [part
I'ecriture automatique. J'essayai moi-meme, et, de se-
maine en semaine, j'ecrivis, dans une demi-conscience,
plusieurs dissertations astronomiques signees Galilee, que
Allan Kardec a publiees plus tard dans son livre La
Genese. Un etudiant plus age que moi, qui se fit auteur
dramatique et membra de I'Academie frangaise, Victorien
Sardou, s'exenjait, de son cote, a un autre genre de
mediumnite, et dessinait des habitations imaginaires sur
la planete Jupiter, signees Bernard Palissy, dessins fort
curieux que Ton peut voir dans mon ouvrage sur les
Forces naturelles inconnues. A cette epoque, les astro-
nomes pensaient que Jupiter etait un monde habitable,
superieur a la Terre par son printemps perpetuel et ses
annees douze fois plus longues que les notres. Je ne
tardai pas a remarquer que nos communications medium-
niques refletaient simplement nos idees personnelles, et
que Galilee pour moi et les habitants de Jupiter pour
Sardou etaient etrangers a ces productions inconscientes
de notre esprit.
C'etait en 1861, au temps de Napoleon III. et de la
reine Victoria. C'est deja loin ; mais nous pouvons re-
monter plus haut encore.
Puisqu'on I'a rappele recemment a la fete officielle dont
les Savants Fran§ais m'ont honore a la Sorbonne au mois
de juin dernier, je me permettrai de me souvenir ici que
le probleme de la survivance de Fame m'a preoccupe
depuis ma plus tendre enfance. Le Ministre Reibel,
representant le Gouvernement, a raconte que dans le
village ou je suis ne, voyant, a I'age de sept ans, passer
un convoi funebre, j'ai interroge un camarade plus age
qui m'apprit qu'on allait enterrer un homme mort et que
je lui ai replique :
" Cesser de vivre, ce n'est pas possible
. . . on ne meurt pas." En rapportant ce souvenir dans
mes Memoires, j'ajoutais : "J'ai reve plusieurs heures,
plusieurs jours, plusieurs semaines, plusieurs mois ; la
conviction que la mort n'existe pas a continue de dominer
mon esprit ; nous ne pouvons pas etre detruits."

Si je rappelle ces souvenirs, chers CoUegues, c'est pour
m'excuser d'avoir accepte cette presidence et pour vous

dire que nous travaillons dans la meme voie. Vos fon-
dateurs etaient Sir William Barrett et Frederic Myers,
auxquels ne tarderent pas a s'associer Henry Sidgwick,
BaKour Stewart, Edmond Gurney, Stainton Moses, Massey,
Podmore, Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge, Arthur
Smith et d'autres chercheurs. Le premier de ces fondateurs
est toujours la, dans son infatiguable activite, et nous
admirons tous sa permanente jeunesse. Le nom de
Frederic Myers reste uni au sien comme le symbole du
travailleur independant auquel la science metapsychique
a du ses principaux progres. Vous avez tenu, Messieurs,
a appliquer des I'origine a vos recherches les principes
severes et absolus de la methode experimentale proclaniee
par votre Bacon.
Vos progres ne se sont pas realises sans luttes et sans
obstacles. Personnellement, je les ai affrontes de pres,
meme a Paris, la surtout peut-etre, car dans le pays de
Voltaire, on a un peu I'habitude de se moquer de tout.
Tandis que vous luttiez contre Faraday, nous luttions
contre Babinet. Ces deux physiciens avaient tort de nier.
Tout le monde salt qu'il y a des imposteurs, des farceurs,
des menteurs, et egalement des credules, des illusionnes,
des faibles d'esprit, et meme des imbeciles. Est-ce une
raison pour ne pas etudier les problemes non resolus ?
Plusieurs d'entre vous peuvent se souvenir d'un ecrivain
charmant, le Prof, de Morgan, le subtil auteur du Budget
of Paradoxes. J'ai ete en relation avec lui dans le
cours des annees 1864-1867, lorsque je redigeais le Cosmos.
Nous pouvons dire avec lui, comme avec luon ami re-
grette A. de Rochas, auquel notre science doit tant
d'observations ingenieuses, que : refuser de s'occuper de
certains phenomenes quand on est convaincu de leur
realite, par crainte du QiCen clira-t-on, c'est a la fois
s'abaisser soi-meme en obeissant a une faiblesse de car-
actere meprisable, et trahir les interets de I'humanite tout
entiere. Nul ne saurait, en effet, prevoir les consequences
d'une decouverte, quand il s'agit de forces nouvelles.
L'ambre des Grecs, qui a donne son nom a I'electricite,
ne paraissait qu'un jeu d'enfant, et les grenouilles de
Galvani ne paraissaient qu'une curiosite insignifiante.
6 Gamille Flammarion. Fpaet

La connaissance des forces de la nature a avance
graduellement, lentement, avec des flux et des reflux,,
depuis les temps les plus anciens, et sous toutes les
latitudes, sans distinction de patries. Les separations
geograpliiques sont aussi inexistantes devant la science que
les limites des constellations dans la carte du ciel. II
n'y a pas de separations entre les peuples, pour les
astronomes—meme pour les aeronautes. Dans mes voyages
aeriens, j'ai plus d'une fois traverse des frontieres, et j'ai
toujours eu la plus grande difficulte a les discerner sur
le sol glissant a mes pieds. Cependant, il est agreable
de rencontrer des compatriotes partout oil Ton va, et je
suis particulierement heureux et fier de saluer ici mes
predecesseurs en cette noble presidence, MM. Bergson et
Richet, qui, depuis longtemps aussi, font planer les etudes
de I'esprit au-dessus de tons les fugitifs interets materiels.
Tons les presidents de cette Association ont suivi le
meme programme philosophique.
On travaille partout a la recherche de la verite ; mais
la branche des etudes psychiques est encore la plus
faible, la plus jeune. L'arbre de la science classique est
un chene qui domine tout superieurement, et la science
nouvelle n'est qu'un roseau. Mais ce roseau deviendra
un arbre, et le vieux chene se transformera, au point de
n'etre plus du tout le meme arbre, avant cent ans seule-
ment. Nous avons encore quelques luttes a soutenir
contre les habitudes inveterees. Tout est a renouveler.
Votre association scientifique, si independante, si loyale,
si active, a joue un role important dans cette evolution,
et elle est universellement estimee. Pour ma part, dans
tons les ouvrages psychiques que j'ai ecrits depuis sa
fondation, je me suis fait un devoir et un plaisir de
celebrer ses travaux, ses conquetes, ses precieuses observa-
tions.
Avouons qu'il faut avoir un courage souvent mal recompense
pour agir envers et contre les opinions dominantes, qui
sont celles de I'ignorance.
Nous Savons que la science classique n'a pas decouvert
toute la verite contenue dans I'univers et que presque
tout reste, au contraire, a decouvrir. Non seulement
txxxix.] Discours Presidentiel. 7
toutes les forces de la nature ne sont pas connues, mais
la plupart echappent a nos sens imparfaits et incomplets.
Ce qu'il importe de ne jamais perdre de vue, e'est I'ap-
preciation exacte de la nature de nos connaissances. Les
analystes scientifiques savent, depuis plus d'un siecle, que
I'observation s'arrete a I'apparence, au phenomene sensible,
sans jamais pouvoir penetrer la substance, ni rien con-
naitre de I'essence reelie des choses. Malebranche avait
etabli ce principe avant Emmanuel Kant. Mais la
science avance graduellement dans ses investigations.
Elle avance vite, surtout actuellement par les applications
merveilleuses des ondes invisibles, de la telegraphic et de
la telephonie sans fil. Avant un demi-siecle les decou-
vertes depasseront autant nos connaissances actuelles que
I'aviation et la radiotelepiionie de 1923 depassent I'aero-
station et la telegraphic d'il y a 50 ans.
* H=
La curiosite est-elle un defaut ? Je ne le pense pas,
quoique Ton ait fait un crime a notre mere Eve d'avoir
voulu gouter au fruit defendu, malgre la defense de
Jehovah, ou plutot, sans doute, a cause de cette defense !
La curiosite est la source de toutes les decouvertes, et
nous ne pouvons qu'y applaudir. Pourtant d'eminents
savants ne ressentent pas ce sentiment subtil, et meme le
desapprouvent. Un jour, le fondateur actuellement sur-
vivant de votre belle Societe psychique, I'emment pro-
fesseur Sir Wilham Barrett, ayant eu des preuves per-
sonnelles des transmissions psychiques a distance, amena
la conversation sur ce sujet avec le celebre physiologiste
allemand Helmholtz, alors a Dublin.—" Je ne puis y croire,
lui rephqua celui-ci ; ni le temoignage de tous les membres
de la Societe Royale, ni meme celui de mes propres sens
ne pourraient m'amener a admettre la transmission de
pensee d'une personne a une autre, en dehors de I'opera-
tion de nos sensations normales, car c'est evidemment
impossible." Nous pouvons remarquer avec Sir Wilham
Barrett que La^Dlace raisonnait plus sagement en distant,
dans sa TMorie analytique des probabilites :
" ISlous sommes
si loin de connaitre tous les agents de la nature et leurs
divers modes d'action qu'il serait peu philosophique de
8 Camille Flammarion.
nier les phenomenes uniquement parce qii'ils sont inex-
plicables dans I'etat actuel de nos connaissances. Seule-
ment, nous devons les examiner avec une attention
d'autant jilus scrupuleuse qu'il parait plus difficile de
les admettre ; et le calcul des probabilites devient indis-
pensable pour determiner jusqu'a quel point il faut
multiplier les observations afin d'obtenir en faveur des
agents qu'elles indiquent une probabUite superieure aux
raisons que Ton pent avoir, d'ailleurs, de ne pas les
admettre." ^
Ces reflexions de Laplace s'appliquent exactement a
nos reclierches metapsychiques et nous confirment dans
notre interpretation de la valeur du nombre des observa-
tions. Remarquons que I'illustre geometre les a emises a
propos du Magnetisme animal et de la baguette divina-
toire, alors particulierement discutes.
Or, la continuite des etudes scientifiques nous a conduits
a penser que tout est dynamisme. Le djmamisme
cosmique reagit les mondes. Newton lui a donne le nom
d'attraction. Mais cette interpretation est insuffisante :
s'il n'y avait que I'attraction dans I'univers, les astres ne
formeraient qu'un seul bloc, car elle les aurait reunis
depuis longtemps, depuis toujours ; il y a, de plus, le
mouvement. Le dynamisme vital regit les etres : dans
I'homme evolue, le dynamisme psychique est constamment
associe au dynamisme vital. Au fond, tous ces dyn-
amismes n'en font qu'un : c'est I'esprit dans la nature,
sourd et aveugle pour nous dans le monde immateriel
et meme dans I'instinct des animaux, inconscient dans
la majorite des ceuvres humaines, conscient dans un
petit nombre.
J'ai ecrit dans Uranie (1888) :
" Ce que nous appelons
matiere s'evanouit lorsque I'analyse scientifique croit la
saisir. Nous trouvons comme soutien de I'univers et
principe de toutes les formes, la force, I'element dynamique.
L'etre humain a pour principe essentiel I'ame. L'univers
est un dynamisme intelligent inco7inaissable."
J'ai ecrit dans les Forces Naturelles inconnues (1906)
:
" Les manifestations psychiques confirment ce que nous
1 Laplace. Thcorie analytiquc des prohabilitis. Introduction.
Lxxxix.] l)iscoiifs Presidentiel. 9
Savons d'autre part, que I'explication purement mecanique
de la nature est insuffisante et qu'il y a dans I'univers
autre chose que la pretendue matiere. Ce n'est pas la
matiere qui regit le monde : C'est un element dynamique
et psychique."
Depuis les annees ou ces lignes ont ete ecrites, le progres
des observations psycMques les a surabondamment con-
firmees. Votre Societe est a la tete de ce mouvement.
Mais revenons au professem: Barrett et a Helmholtz.
Helmholtz n'etait pas curieux. Comme beaucoup d'autres,
il avait sur certains points I'esprit hermetiquenient ferme.
Nous entendons assez souvent des hommes relativement
intelligents nous dire : Je le verrais que je ne le croirais
pas. II y en a, d'ailleurs, qui n'aiment pas se dornier la
peine de reflechir. Le professeur Barrett raconte aussi
que Sir W. Rowan Hamilton, apres avoir publie sa fam-
euse decouverte matliematique des quaternions, en parla
a I'astronome royal Airy et voulut lui exposer cette tlieorie.
Apres quelques instants, Airy I'arreta :
" Je ne vols pas
cela du tout" fit-il. " J'ai etudie le sujet pendant plusieurs
mois," repliqua Hamilton, " et je suis certain du theoreme."
" Oh !
" repondit Airy, " je viens d'y penser pendant deux ou
trois minutes et je vols qu'il n'y a rien la." II en est
souvent ainsi dans nos etudes.
J'ai eu moi-meme I'occasion de voir a Greenwich le
Directeur de I'Observatoire George Biddel Airy, et j 'admi-
rals sa verte vieillesse ; mais je ne pouvais m'empecher de
penser a la decouverte de Neptune par Le Verrier. Cette
decouverte ne serait pas frangaise si Airy avait ete plus
curieux, car il avait le Memoire d'Adams dans son tiroir
depuis plusieurs mois lorsque Le Verrier annonga sa
decouverte a 1' Academic des Sciences le 31 x4out 1846.
D'ailleurs, Le Verrier avait fait cette decouverte porte
par sa passion mathematique, et, en dehors des mathe-
matiques, n'etait pas tres curieux lui-meme. Un soir, de
I'annee 1876, j'observais, au grand equatorial de I'Observa-
toire de Paris, une etoile double qui, par hasard, etait
voisine de la planete Neptune. Par curiosite, apres avoir
mesure mon etoile double, je dirigeai la lunette sur
Neptune, et cherchai a en apprecier le diametre. L'illustre
10 Camitle Flammarion.
Directeur etait monte, ce soir-la, sur la terrasse, et me
questionna sur mes observations :
" Vous mesurez vos
etoiles doubles ?
" fit-il. " Oui, Monsieur le Directeur, mais
savez-vous ce que j'ai en ce moment dans le champ ? . . .
Votre planete Neptune ! EUe est curieuse ; elle est
bleue. Voulez-vous la voir ?
"—" Oh ! non," me repondit-il.
" Du reste, je ne I'ai jamais vue."
Etait-ce une boutade ? Etait-ce vrai ? Ce qui est
certain, c'est que I'astronomie physique ne I'interessait
pas du tout.
Tout le monde salt que Le Verrier et Adams ont
decouvert par le calcul la position de Neptune dans le
ciel, et que c'est un jeune astronome de Berlin, Galle,
qui, sur I'invitation de Le Verrier, dirigea une lunette
vers cette region du ciel dont il construisait precisement
la carte, et ayant reyu une lettre de Le Verrier, le 23
Septembre, constata le soir meme, la presence de I'astre
inconnu.
L'Astronomie, la noble science du ciel, n'est pas seule-
ment I'etude aride des mouvements celestes et des lois de
la gravitation. Ce n'est pas seulement la position des
astres dans I'espace infini, qui nous interesse, c'est encore,
et c'est surtout, leur constitution, leur nature ; nous ne
voulons pas seulement savoir ou Us sont, mais ce qu'ils
sont. L'astronomie physique est le complement de I'astro-
nomie mathematique. Qu'est-ce que I'Univers ?
L'homme est un atome pensant au sein de I'infini et
de I'eternite, vivant, sur la Terre, entre I'infiniment
grand et I'infiniment petit. Les dernieres decouvertes astro-
nomiques sont plus eloquentes que tous les poemes.
Qu'est-ce que tous les peintres, tous les poetes devant la
realite astronomique ?
Vos travaux ont apporte a la science les plus heureux
resultats. Le 23 Avril 1887, votre President le Professeur
BaKour Stewart, membre de la Societe Royale, a fonde
avec vous un Comite special dans le but de verifier " the
reahty of such alleged spiritualistic phenomena as may
be brought before them," comite compose de William
Crookes, Oliver Lodge, William Barrett, E. Gurney
et E. Myers. Tout le monde connait aujourd'hui les
LXXXIX.] Discours Presidentiel. 11
conquetes obtenues par ces investigateurs independants.
Les faits dont vous avez etabli I'authenticite sent irre-
cusables. II y a, assurement, des observations qui par-
aissent contradictoires ; mais mille faits negatifs n'infir-
ment pas un seul fait positif.
H» "I^
Nous venons de dire que Fhomme est un atome pensant,
vivant au sein de I'infini, et que les decouvertes astro-
nomiques sont plus eloquentes que tous les poemes.
Cette realite sublime, personne ne s'en doutait au temps
d'Homere, au temps d'Hesiode, au temps de Pytliagore,
au temps de Moise, au temps de Jesus-Christ, ni meme
au temps de Copernic. Hesiode croyait donner une
grande idee de I'etendue de I'univers en disant que
renclume de Vulcain avait mis 9 jours et 9 nuits a
tomber du ciel sur la Terre, et qu'il lui en faudrait
autant pour tomber jusqu'aux enfers. On pent calculer
que cette pretendue hauteur du ciel ne represente guere
plus que la distance de la Lune, I'astre le plus proche de
nous ; elle est de 400.000 kilometres et notre satellite
gravite a 384.000, trente fois seulement la largeur de
notre globe. Au temps de Copernic, les etoiles etaient
supposees appartenir a une sphere equidistante de la Terre.
Les cometes etaient encore des meteores terrestres. Or,
pensons, jugeons.
Le Soleil est 400 fois plus loin de nous que la Lune ;
la derniere planete de notre systeme est 30 fois plus loin
de nous que le Soleil ; I'etoile la plus proche est 9330
fois plus loin ou a 280.000 rayons de I'orbite terrestre.
Ces mesures sont d'hier, historiquement parlant, ne datant
meme pas de cent ans. Le beau chant de la Bible :
Coeli enarrant gloriam Dei, est centuple dans la pensee
moderne. Un palais prodigieux s'est substitue a une
chetive cabane.
Supposons qu'au sein du spectacle silencieux d'une nuit
etoilee notre esprit s'eleve dans la contemplation celeste.
Nous Savons aujourd'hui que chaque etoile est un soleil
et que la plus proche plane a une distance telle que la
lumiere, a la vitesse de 300.000 kilometres par seconde,
emploie 4 ans et 3 mois a parcourir I'espace qui nous en
12 Camille Ftammarion. [part
separe. Nous savons aussi que le Soleil est 1.300.000
fois plus volumineux que notre planete, et que les etoiles
sont de meme ordre. Ainsi notre esprit se forme une
premiere idee des espaces celestes et des grandeurs.
Parmi les etoiles qui frappent le mieux nos regards
dans les belles nuits d'ete, ohoisissons I'une de celles que
toutes les contemplatrices du ciel ont le plus souvent
remarquee, la radieuse Vega de la Lyre, de premiere
grandeur. Elle plane a 237 millions de kilometres, a
25 annees de lumiere. C'est une splendide etoile blanche,
dans laquelle I'liydrogene domine, plus blanche que notre
soleil d'or. Pouvons-nous imaginer atteindre cette dis-
tance, par la pensee, en quelques secondes ? Peut-etre.
Soit ! Allons plus loin dans la meme direction. Re-
gardons cette petite constellation de la Lyre. Elle est
principalement composee de 5 etoiles (4 en losange formant
une petite lyre dont Vega serait la tete). Entre les
deux plus eloignees (/3 et j de 3" grandeur), il y a une
nebuleuse particulierement curieuse, en forme d'anneau.
Elle est invisible a I'oeil nu, mais en dirigeant notre
regard vers ce point du ciel, nous la traversons. Au
telescope, elle est " splendidissima." C'est un anneau
elliptique (sans doute circulaire, vu obliquement) avec
une etoile au milieu de son disque central. L'analyse
spectrale y montre des vapeurs de fer et de zinc. C'est
une genese de systeme de monde en formation, qui git a
une distance immense au-dela de Vega.
Non loin de la ; notre regard pent plonger vers une
autre nebuleuse, ou plutot vers un amas d'etoiles, le
celebre amas d'Hercule, voisin de la Lyre ; la merveille
des merveilles. C'est une agglomeration de soleils. . . .
De combien de milliers ? . . . Une pose photographique
d'une minute en enregistre 820, une pose de six minutes
35.000. . . . C'est inenarrable !
Sa distance parait etre de cent mille annees de lumiere
—
946 quatrillions de kilometres,—univers lointain, different
du notre, dont le diametre est comparable a celui de
notre Voie Lactee : mille annees de lumiere ! . . .
Eh bien, de Vega nous avons franchi, par la nebuleuse
annulaire de la Lyre et par I'amas d'Hercule, des milliards
LXXXIX.] Discours Presidentiel. 13
et des milliards de kilometres, nous avons traverse d'im-
menses deserts sideraux, nous avons parcouru des regions
stelliferes, nous avons salue, au passage, des mondes
defunts et des cimetieres d'astres, des tombes et des
berceaux, et toujours devant nous les espaces sans fin
se sont succede . . . 384.000 kilometres d'ici a la Lune,
4.500.000.000 d'ici a Neptune, 237.000.000.000.000 d'ici
a Vega, 946.000.000.000.000.000 d'ici a I'univers lointain
d'Hercule, abimes apres abimes, immensites apres immen-
sites, la Terre est perdue de vue depuis longtemps, et
tout notre systeme planetaire et le Soleil s'est eloigne au
rang d'etoile imperceptible.
Oil sommes-nous ?
Nous n'avons pas avance d'un seul pas. Nous sommes
toujours au centre de Vinfini.
Pasteur etait dans le vrai en rappelant dans son dis-
cours de reception a I'Academie Fran9aise les aspirations
de la curiosite humaine cherchant a tout connaitre :
" Qu'y a-t-il au-dela? L'esprit hvimain, pousse par une
force invincible, ne cessera jamais de se demander :
" Qu'y
a-t-il au-dela ? Veut-il s'arreter soit dans le temps, soit
dans I'espace ? Comme le point oil il s'arrete n'est qu'une
grandeur finie, plus grande seulement que toutes celles
qui I'ont precedee, a peine commence-t-il a I'envisager, que
revient I'implacable question et toujours, sans qu'il puisse
faire taire le cri de sa curiosite. II ne sert de rien de
repondre, au-dela sont des espaces, des temps ou des
grandeurs sans limites. Nul ne comprend ces paroles.
Celui qui proclame I'existence de I'infini, et personne ne
pent y echapper, accumule dans cette affirmation, plus
de surnaturel qu'il n'y en a dans tous les miracles de
toutes les religions ; car la notion de I'infini a ce double
caractere de s'imposer et d'etre incomprehensible."
Apres I'etendue, incommensurable et sans bornes, con-
siderons les grandeurs.
Si nous prenons le globe terrestre comme terme de
comparaison, nous voyons que :
Jupiter est 1295 fois plus gros que la Terre ;
Le Soleil est 1.300.000 fois plus gros que la Terre.
C'est la proportion d'une boule de 18 centimetres de
14 Camille Flammarion. [part
diametre pour la Terre, d'une boule de 2 metres pour
Jupiter et d'une coupole de 20 metres pour le Soleil
(celle du Pantheon de Paris).
On est arrive recemment malgre d'extremes difficultes,
a mesurer le diametre de quelques etoiles, et Ton a
trouve
:
Pour Arcturus 24 fois le Soleil.
. Pour Betelgeuse, 248 fois le Soleil.
Pour Antares 460 fois le Soleil. Done 500,000,000 fois
la Terre.
C'est-a-dire que, dans la proportion precedente, le soleil
Antares serait represente par un dome de 9 kilometres de
diametre.
Qu'est-ce que le monde terrestre a cote du monde
d'Antares ? Et que peut etre le systeme d'Antares ?
Vous pouvez observer cette etoile du Scorpion, rouge et
rutilante, les beaux soirs d'ete, et decouvrir a son contact,
un petit compagnon vert emeraude de T grandeur,
soleil vert associe a un soleil rouge. Et quel soleil ! ! ! !
Ces grandeurs nous stupefient. Nous avons peine a
nous les representor. Que dirons-nous de Vetendue des
amas stellaires et des nebuleuses
!
Pour ces valeurs numeriques, nous ne pouvons plus
nous limiter aux evaluations kilometriques. Qu'est-ce
qu'un kilometre ? Que sont les 12.742 kilometres du
diametre de la Terre devant les horizons infinis que nous
considerons ici ? Rien ou a peu pres. L'unite des
mesures celestes n'est plus le kilometre, ni le diametre
terrestre, ni la distance d'ici au Soleil (de 149.500.000
kilometres) : c'est trop peu. Cette unite de mesure est
le parsec, c'est-a-dire la parallaxe d'une seconde, la distance
de laquelle on verrait le rayon de I'orbite terrestre
(149.500.000 kilometres) sous Tangle d'une seconde (I'epais-
seur d'un cheveu eloigne a vingt metres de I'oeil). Cette
longueur egale 30.800 milliards de kilometres ou 3,26
annees de lumiere.
Jugeons, si nous le pouvons. Nous avons vu, tout a
I'heure, que le diametre de I'amas d'Hercule est estime
a mille annees de lumiere ou 308 parsecs. Ce diametre
est de I'ordre de celui de la Voie Lact^e, composee de

Certaines nebuleuses sont incomparablement plus vastes

que I'amas d'Hercule.
I I Dans la celebre nebuleuse australe connue sous le nom
de Nuee de Magellan, cinq amas globulaires de la meme
grandeur apparente se montrent en la region nord et font,
sans aucun doute, partie du Grand Nuage. Leur distance

Notre Voie Lactee elle-meme dans laquelle le Soleil
lui-meme n'est qu'une faible etoile, parait se deplacer dans
I'immensite au taux de 600.000 metres par seconde,
emportant dans son cycle, le soleil et son systeme, notre
minuscule Terre et ses destinees, en ajoutant un 14*^
mouvement aux 13 que nous connaissons deja.
Et qu'est-ce que toutes ces vitesses ? A quel repere
fixe les rapportons-nous ? . . . A aucun !
Et les immenses nebuleuses noires ? Et les astres
obscurs ? Et les soleils eteints ? Et les mondes defunts ?
Et tout I'invisible qui peuple anonymement I'immensite
siderale ?
Nous venons de prendre une idee des etendues, des
grandeurs et des vitesses. C'est I'infiniment grand pour
I'homme terrestre. Descendons maintenant dans Vinfini-
ment petit.
Revenons ici, a Pascal, a sa definition celebre du ciron
microscopique :
" Qu'un ciron offre dans la petitesse de son corps des
parties incomparablement j)Ius petites, des jambes avec
des jointures, des veines dans ces jambes, du sang dans
ces veines, des humeurs dans ce sang, des gouttes dans
ces humeurs, des vapeurs dans ces gouttes ;
que, divisant
encore ces dernieres choses, Thomme epuise ses forces en
ses conceptions, et que le dernier objet oii il peut arriver
soit maintenant celui de notre discours ; il pensera peut-
etre que c'est la I'extreme petitesse de la nature. Je
veux lui faire voir la-dedans un abime nouveau ;
je veux
lui peindre non seulement I'univers visible, mais I'immen-
site qu'on peut concevoir de la Nature, dans I'enceinte de
ce raccourci d'atomes. Qu'il y voie une infinite d'univers,
LXXXIX.J Discours Presidentiel. 17
dont chacun a son firmament, ses planetes, sa terre, en
la meme proportion que le monde visible ;
dans cette
terre des animaux, et enfin des cirons, dans lesquels il
retrouvera ce que les premiers ont donne, et trouvant
encore dans les autres, la meme chose, sans fin et sans
repos, qu'il se perde dans ces merveilles, aussi etonnantes
danri leur petitesse que les autres par leur etendue, car
qui n'admirera que notre corps, qui tantot n'etait pas
perceptible dans I'univers, imperceptible lui-meme dans le
sein du tout, soit a present, un colosse, un monde, ou
plutot un tout, a Tegard du neant oii Ton ne peut ar-
river ?
" Car enfin qu'est-ce que I'homme dans la nature ?
Un neant a I'egard de I'infini, un tout a I'egard du neant :
un milieu entre rien et tout. Infiniment eloigne de
comprendre les extremes, la fin des choses et leur principe
sont pour lui invinciblement caches dans un secret im-
penetrable."
Aiiisi parlait Pascal au XVII*^ siecle, Les decouvertes
du vingtieme siecle sur les atomes nous ont ramenes
dans sa sphere de meditation en en montrant I'absolue
realite, et I'etude de la lumiere nous a conduits a ex-
primer Fechelle de I'univers en unites optiques qui descen-
dent depuis les etendues incommensurables dominant la
longueur de I'annee-lumiere (9 trillions 467 milliards de
kilometres) devenue le metre des mesures siderales, jusqu'au
millionieme de millimetre, qui exprime les longueurs d'onde
du spectre solaire.
L'infininient petit est peut etre plus difficile a concevoir
que I'infiniment grand. Que I'espace soit sans bornes, en
n'importe quelle direction, que nous puissions voyager en
esprit, avec n'importe quelle vitesse, pendant I'eternite,
sans approclier d'aucun terme, nous le comprenons. Le
contraire nous est clau-ement inadmissible, puisque quelle
que soit la barriere que nous imaginons, notre esprit saute
par dessus. Mais I'infiniment petit ! Considerons les
feuilles d'or, par exemple. Les batteurs d'or fabriquent
des feuilles dont I'epaisseur n'est que le dixieme du micron,
q'est-a-dire le dixieme du niillieme de millirnetre, lis s'arretent-
B
18 Camille Flammarion. [part
la parce que, pratiqiiement, ils ne peuvent pas aller plus
loin. Le diametre des atonies de I'or qui compose ces
feuilles est done inferieur au dixieme de micron, et
leur masse inferieure a la quantite d'or qui emplit un
cube de ce diametre, c'est-a-dire 1 cent-milliardieme del ij
milligramme. Ajoutons, avec M. Jean Perrin, que la
masse de I'atome d'hydrogene est environ 200 fois plus
petite, et si faible qu'il en faut 20 trillions pour con-
stituer un milligramme. La discussion conduit meme a
conclure que les diametres des atomes sont inferieurs au
millionieme de millimetre, et leur masse au cent-millionieme
de trillionieme, de gramme. ... II parait, d'apres des
calculs rigoureux et des experiences tres precises, qu'un
milligramme de radium, contient deux millions de trillions
d'atomes. . . . C'est I'invisible dans I'invisibilite, I'extra-
invisible dans I'extra-invisibilite,—et j'ajouterai : I'incom- s
prehensible dans I'incomprehensibilite.
Arretons-nous. Je prie les auditeurs qui m'ont suivi
jusqu'ici de m'excuser de les avoir entraines aussi loin.
Mais c'est I'eblouissement meme de la splendeur de la
verite.
Maintenant, pensons que dans cet univers, du plus for-
midable des mondes au plus minuscule des atomes, tout
est en activite, en mouvement, en vibration.
^ ^ ^
Dans la contemplation des grandeurs astronomiques
resumees tout a I'heure, nous avons ete transportes un
instant a travers I'infini de I'espace et du temps, et nous
avons senti que I'Astronomie est la premiere et la plus
importante de toutes les sciences, parce qu'elle nous
apprend quelle place nous occupons dans la creation et
comment I'univers est constitue : ceux qui I'ignorent vivent
sans savoir oil ils sont. Mais la connaissance de I'univers
materiel ne suffit pas a une instruction qui souhaite
etre complete. Les recherches sur la nature et la des-
tinee de Fame humaine, m'ont toujours paru associees ^s.
directement a la connaissance astronomique. D'ailleurs
le ciel a toujours ete associe aux vues religieuses sur la
vie future. Les etudes psychiques se presentent a nous
comme le complement naturel de la connaissance du ciel,

IS Si Fame continue d'exister apres la mort du corps,
le doit etre quelque part. Sans doute, la monade

Barrett a remarque avec raison combieii il est surprenani
qu'un grand nombre des instructeurs Chretiens desapprou

que ces recherches renversent les fondations du materia'

par notre Societe, la transmission de la pensee, suffil
seule a prouver que I'ame existe independamment dt
cerveau materiel et pent, par consequent, lui survivre.
Grace a vos travaux, et principalement a ceux de Williair
Barrett et de Frederic Myers, les transmissions telepathiques
sont irrefutablement prouvees. La telepathic est certainei
quoique encore exceptionellement etudiee, aussi certaine que
I'existence de Londres, de Sirius et de I'oxygene, et povirtani
elle rencontre encore des dissidents qui I'ignorent. Elk
parait vmiverselle, s'exercer meme entre les hommes et
les animaux. Ses applications dans le monde mora]
seront j)eut-etre plus vastes encore que celles de la gravita
tion dans le monde physique. Et tout nous autorise a
affirmer qu'elle s'exerce meme entre les morts et les viv
ants. Dans son discours du 18 Mai 1900, Myers lui-meme
nous a fait senth son immense ampleur.
Quel est son mode de transmission ? Devons-nous
penser, avec Crookes, que sa vitesse de propagation egale
celle de la lumiere, avec 9 trilUons de vibrations par
seconde 1 M. Marconi n'a-t-il pas dit, recemment, dans
son discours presidentiel de Bmningliam, que, d'apres
Sir Oliver Lodge, la telepathic,—sur laquelle il n'a pas
d'opinion personnelle,—n'est pas due a des vibrations
physiques, a la fa^on des vagues electriques ? Pour
nous, quelle que soit sa nature, elle existe, et se montre
independaute de I'espace, et j'ajouterai qu'il me semble
qu'elle agit, non pas entre les cerveaux, comme le croyait
le Professeur Flournoy, mais entre les esprits.
Sir Oliver Lodge disait, en 1892, dans son Discours au
Congres scientifique de I'Association britannique pour
I'Avancement des sciences :
" La grande majorite des
savants est hostile aux recherches sur les transmissions
de pensees, et deliberement opposee a leur discussion.
Et cela non pas apres un long examen, ce qui justifierait
I'opposition, mais souvent sans aucun examen." Lodge

a parle comme I'avait fait Copernic en 1543 dans la
dedicace de son livre au pape :
" Mathemata mathematicis
scribuntur. Si fortasse erunt ixaTuioXoyoi qui cum
omnium mathematum ignari sunt, illorum judicium con-
temnam. Les verites mathematiques ne peuvent etre
jugees que par les mathematiciens. Je meprise le juge-
ment des matlieologues ignorants." ^Cliacun ne devrait
se permettre de juger que les choses qu'il connait.
Malgre tant d'obstacles, vous avez fonde^ les bases de
la science ^integrale'^de I'avenir, car I'univers n'est pas un
as semblage materiel de mondes inertes et une combinaison
d'atomes mecaniquement associes, mais un edifice organise
et regi par des forces invisibles agissant selon des lois
intelligentes. Une force spiritueUe, infinie et inconnais-
sable, est la cause premiere de toutes les autres causes ;
eUe est I'ame de I'univers ; mais il est impossible a des
etres finis de comprendre I'infini. Mens agitat molem,
ecrivait Virgile au VI'' chant de I'Eneide : Un principe
spirituel anime le monde. Cette affirmation etait pro-
clamee eloquemment trente ans avant la naissance de
Jesus-Christ. Elle I'avait ete bien des siecles auparavant
par Bouddlia Qakya-Mouni, par Confucius, j)ar Pythagore,
dent la maxime etait Numeri regunt mundum. Mais
les apparences materielles, les impressions de nos sens
physiques, incomplets et trompeurs, ont echpse cette
verite fondamentale, et nos sciences actuelles instituees
sm" I'etude des apparences, depuis I'astronomie jusqu'a
la chimie et la physiologic, sont uacompletes. Vous les
completez. Les noms de Crookes, de Myers, de Lodge,
de William James, de Barrett, de Balfour, de Bergson,
de Richet, s'ajoutent a celui de Newton.
En France, on travaiUe aussi. Des progres dignes d'at-
tention ont ete recemment realises dans ce pays voisin
qui n'est separe du votre que par un etroit canal, inex-
istant pour la telepathic. Parmi ces progres en faveur
de I'avancement des sciences psychiques, je me fais un
devoir et un plaish de signaler la fondation de i'lnstitut

Un ami de I'humanite, M. Jean Meyer, a compris cette
necessite moderne, et c'est a lui que nous devons ce
double progres. L'lnstitvit metapsychique est etabli sous
la haute direction du savant docteur Gustave Geley,
avec la collaboration du professeur Richet, de M. Santo-
liquido, du Comte de Gramont, du Docteur Calmette,
et de plusieurs eminents psychistes. La Psychical Society
pent feliciter M. Jean Meyer de cette oeuvre, et emettre
le voeu que I'avenir de ces institutions soit assure en
France comme elles le sont en Angleterre.
Je pourrais aj outer ici que, cette annee meme, la
litterature psychique vient d'etre signalee en France par
la publication des experiences faites autrefois par Victor
Hugo. II y a longtemps que cette publication etait
attendue. Ces experiences datent de 1853, 1854, et 1855.
Depuis 1855, 68 annees se sont ecoulees, et 38 depuis le
depart du poete. Tout vient a point a qui salt attendre ;
mais cette attente a ete vraiment un peu longue.
J'avais donne dans mes Memoires un avant-gout de
ces communications transcendantales. Nous sommes heur-
eux de les voir publiees aujourd'hui presque in extenso.
Elles exposent devant nous le plus inextricable des pro-
blemes. Ni la subconscience, ni Fauto-suggestion, ni la
transmission de pensee, ni I'hypothese spirite de I'identite
n'en donnent la solution. On y entend Eschyle, Shake-
speare, Moliere, Mahomet, Moi'se, Platon, Socrate, et meme
Jesus-Christ ; mais on y entend aussi la Mort, I'Ombre
du Sepulcre, I'ldee, le lion d'Androcles et autres entites
inexistantes. D'admirables inspirations poetiques nous y
eblouissent. Mais partout on y sent I'influence de Victor
Hugo qui, pourtant, n'a jamais voulu se mettre a la
table dictant ces phrases et s'est contente du role de
secretaire. L'editeur de ces pages mysterieuses, M.
Gustave Simon, a bien voulu conclure en citant mon
humble et sincere opinion que nous ne savons a peu pres
rien sur la nature reelle de ces phmomenes.
Je me permettrai de me souvenir que Victor Hugo a

Soixante annees d'observations, intermittentes, mais
assez regulierement suivies, de ces phenomenes, m'ont
conduit aux deductions suivantes :
L'etre humain est doue de facultes encore inconnues a
la science, manifestees notamment par les transmissions
telepathiques, par la vue sans les yeux a distance, par
la vue d'evenements a venir. Ces facultes psychiques
formeront un des chapitres les plus importants de la
science future. Elles nc sont pas une production du
cerveau ; elles sont essentiellement intellectuelles, apparti-
ennent a I'esprit.

Au moment de la mort, ces facultes transcendantales
se manifestent par un certain nombre d'actes varies, les

de phenomenes physiques. Le passage de la vie a la
mort est signale au loin, soit—ce qui est le plus frequent

La telepathic existe entre les morts et les vivants
comme entre les vivants.
Les transmissions telepathiques entre vivants, les mani-
festations et les apparitions de mourants ne sont plus
niees que par ceux qui n'ont pas eu le temps d'etudier

n'en est pas de meme des manifestations et apparitions

celles-ci sont plus rares et moins faciles a prouver. Pour ma

ON HINDRANCES AND COMPLICATIONS IN TELE-
PATHIC COMMUNICATION.
By Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.
Critics of the evidence put forward for communication
from the dead often demur not only to the frequent fail-
ure to get " messages " at all, but to the confused
quality of the " messages " for which the dead are sup-
posed to be responsible—to the fragmentariness of the
truthful elements in communications about matters con-
cerning which the alleged communicator must, it would
seem, be well informed, and the amount of irrelevant
matter and actual error in which the truthful elements
are liable to be imbedded. " Why," say the critics,
" cannot the dead, if they communicate at all, say what,
they mean."
Now it is very difficult to obtain adequate evidence of
communication from the dead, and many reasons may be
urged for caution in the acceptance of alleged communica-
tions as genuine. But the confused quality of many
of the supposed " messages " when received is not one of
these reasons. Communication from the dead is presum-
ably of the same nature as telepathic communication
between the living, and similar confusion is exhibited in
what appear to be indubitable instances of the latter.
I do not think that anyone experienced in psychical
research doubts this. But it has occurred to me that an
examination of cases of telepathy between the living,
from the pomt of view of imperfection of transmission,
might be interesting and might throw light on the process
of telepathy. Particular cases have often been com-
mented on, but I do not think they have been collected
and compared.
:l Lxxxix.] Tele.pathic Comnmnication. 29
A soi disant Myers communicating through Mrs. Hol-
land's automatic writing, once said, " The nearest simile
I can find to express the difficulties of sending a message
—is that I appear to be standing behind a sheet of frosted
glass—which blurs sight and deadens sound—and dictating
feebly—to a reluctant and somewhat obtuse secretary." ^
This analogy from indistinct perception and consequent
misinterpretation of impressions derived through the
senses, is as applicable to telepathic communications be-
!
tween the living as it is to supposed communications
from the dead. But what I want to examine as far as
possible, is what part of the failure, when a telepathic
message is incompletely transmitted, is due to what we
may call the sheet of frosted glass—that is, the inherent
difficulty in the passage of an idea from one mind to
another without the use of the senses—what to the feeble
dictation—that is, want of power in the agent—and what
to the reluctance or obtuseness of the secretary—that is,
obstacles in the percipient's own mind.
As regards the frosted glass—some hindrance to free
transmission between two individuals, A and B, there
must be so long as they retain their individuality. If
there were no barrier A and B would be merged into one.
But I may say at once that I do not think we have
evidence of obstruction, apart' from A and B themselves
(as we should have, for instance, if the transmission were
a physical phenomenon like the passage of light). If we
stick to our analogy, the " sheet of frosted glass " must
symbolize the aggregate difficulties due to the minds,
embodied or unembodied, of agent and percipient and
cannot be studied separately from these. The one piece
of evidence suggesting obstruction outside the two minds
is the apparent influence of the spatial relation between
agent and percipient in some telepathic experiments
—
experiments when agent and percipient are in different
rooms succeeding less well than when they are together.

This is undou1)tedly a fact in certain cases, whatever the
explanation. In other experimental cases, however, dis-
tance appears to be no hindrance, nor does it, so far as
we know, affect spontaneous telepathy, and I am disposed
to think that in experiments where it does operate ad-
versely this is diie to a subjective effect in the mind of
agent or percipient or both, arising perhaps from self
suggestion or the lack of necessary exciting stimulus.
Practically our investigation will then be confined to
what we can learn about the telepathic process in the
minds of agent and percipient. As regards the latter,
there are some preliminary remarks to make before pro-
ceeding to telepathic cases.
We shall find that an important difficulty in the em-
ergence of an idea telepathically conveyed, appears to lie
in the passage of the idea from one stratum, as we may
call it, of the percipient's mind to another. My readers
will doubtless grant me the existence of these strata and
will admit that often, and probably always, there are in
us two or more streams of memory and intelligent mental
action existmg concurrently, which are more or less sepa-
rate and more or less independent of one another, though
ideas may pass from one to the other. Any such stream
of which our ordinary waking consciousness is not at a
given moment aware, may be spoken of as at that
moment subliminal to it. We get gliiiipses of double
mentation at work in dreams, in automatic writing, in
sensory hallucinations such as crystal visions, in hypnotism,
and otherwise. Assuming this granted I need not here
go into the evidence for it. This will be found in many
papers in our Proceedings and elsewhere. The problems
about the nature of human personality suggested by
these divisions of consciousness are of course of great
importance, but do not concern us at this moment, and
for simplicity I want to avoid them as far as possible.
What I want to show is that in emerging from a
sublimmal stratum an idea or intention may be distorted
or curtailed ; and it will be best to show this in the first
instance in cases where there is no question of telepathy.
Examples may be found among interesting experiments

i described by Gurney in Proceedings, Vols. IV. and V.^
and by F. W. H. Myers in Proceedings, Vol. VIII. ,^ though
in neither case were the experiments tried exactly with a view
I to throwing light on the question now before us. In the
particular experiments I am about to quote, ideas were
impressed on persons in hypnosis, who were found on
being immediately awakened to have no conscious recol-
lection of the said ideas. Gurney's subjects while hyp-
notised were instructed to write with a planchette a
i!
prescribed sentence or sometimes a line rhyming to a
given one. After waking, their hand having been placed
on the planchette, which was screened from their eyes,
they were set to read aloud—the idea given to the hyp-
notic consciousness emerging meanwhile in planchette
writing. In Myers' experiments a post-hjrpnotic crystal
vision was prescribed and duly experienced. In one case,
therefore, the idea emerged in motor, and in the other in
sensory automatism. In some of Gurney's experiments
the readmg aloud did not seem to interfere with the
performance of the task set to the subliminal self, but
in others there was some mutual interference ; the following
is a case in point.
P—11 was told several times [in hypnosis] '
It has left
off snowing '
; and then, when woke and set to planchette,
he was made to read aloud. The writing which appeared
was,
It has Ifeft sn
and while this was proceeding, the reading was bad and
stumbling. When the writing stopjied, the reading became
appreciably more correct and fluent. Re-hjrpnotisation
afforded a glimpse of the condition in which the secondary
intelligence had found itself. Asked what he had been
doing, the 'subject' rephed, "Trying to write 'it has
left off snowing.' " Asked i£ he had been reading, he
said, " Reading ! No, I haven't been reading," and added,
"something seemed to disturb me." "How was that?"

" Something seemed to keep moving about in front of me,
so I got back into bed agam." " Didn't Mr. Gurney hold a
book and make you read aloud ? " " No, somebody kept
movmg about. I didn't Uke the looks of them. Kept
wandering to and fro. Horrible, awful ! I thought to
myself '
I'll get into bed.' It looked so savage—quite
mmerved me," etc., etc. (P/oc, Vol. IV., p. 319.)
Here we have an illustration of a train of thought and
action impressed on the hypnotic stratum of the mind,
working itself out, but in an imperfect manner, when
that stratum (on awaking from hypnosis) has become
subliminal. The waking intelligence knows nothing of it
unless and until it is shown the automatic writing that
has been produced without its participation. It has been
aware, however, of some disturbing element, some inter-
ruption to its own proceedings. On re-hypnotisation, it
is found that the intelligence which has been writing,
now no longer subliminal, has been still more aware of
disturbance, thoiigh unconscious of the action of the
waking intelligence which has produced it. We have
not here any reception of a message from the subliminal
stratum to the sujiraliminal except through the automatic
writing, but we have evidence of mutual interference
between the two strata working independently. This may
have been due only to the two sections of the mind
having simultaneously to use a common organism to
express themselves. It seems possible that it was the
movement of the print before the eyes, or rather of the
eyes along the lines of print, that produced in the sub-
liminal seK, unaware of the reading aloud, the night-
mare-ish impression of the disturbance.
In Myers's experiments we also have the two strata at
work, but as it were in co-operation, not antagonism.
As in Gurney's experiment, an impression with instruction
as to action is given in hypnosis to that mental stratum
which, as soon as the hypnotised person is awakened,
becomes subliminal. But the action prescribed does not
involve outward bodily action like the writing. The
subliminal is told to produce a visual hallucination, a

crystal vision/ representing a subject described to it.
This duly occurs and the waking intelligence without
knowuig the origin of the picture has to observe
and interpret it. Myers writes {Proc. Vol. VIII.,
p. 460) :
" Next time I suggested [in hypnosis] a hippojmtamus—an
animal which P. had never seen m the flesh. On being
awakened he saw on the card what he called a rhinoceros.
He complamed that it was rather indistinct ; he was not
sure whether it had horns or tusks. There is a certain
interest m this as indicating that the haUucination was
founded upon a mental picture suggested by my words,
rather than on the words themselves. One might have
supposed that, since my whole suggestion consisted of the
word hippopotamus, the awakened subject, however vaguely
he saw the beast, would have knowTi that it was meant
for a hippopotamus. But the picture, vague as it was,
seemed to be more communicable from the hypnotic to
the suprahminal self than the word which had originally
generated it. A picture was what had been ordered and
a picture came." [Proc, VIII., ^5. 460.)
I next told P. (hypnotised) the story of Robinson
Crusoe finding the foot-print and fearing savages. . . .
Awakened and set before the glass of water, P. at once
exclaimed, " Why, there's Buffalo Bill ! He's dressed in
feathers, and skuis rormd him ; almost hke a savage.
He's walldng about in a waste place. ... I can see
something else coming from another part,—it's a blackie.
. . . Look at them now, how they're arguing ! Buffalo
BiU and his black man." . . .
Observe that . . . the footmark, which was the point
on which I had chiefly dwelt, was not observed.
... P. had read Eobinson Crusoe ; but Buffalo BiU
^ I call it crystal vision as the hallucinations were of the natvire of
visions in a crystal ; but in the eases quoted, what was actually aimed
at and obtained was in one ease a hallucinatory picture on a blank
card, and in the other a moving picture in a glass of water.

was plainly fresher in his memory.^ Proc, Vol. VIII.,
p. 461.
In the first of these two experiments by Myers, we
have indistinctness in the picture evolved and transmitted
to the sujDraliminal intelligence—probably owing to in-
distinctness in the idea which reached the hypnotic
consciousness, for I do not think Myers's idea of a
hippopotamus would hive been distmct, and the percipient
was not acquainted with the animal. In the second
experiment the hallucinatory vision seems to have been
distinct as far as it went, though not apparently com-
pletely representing the scene prescribed. In both the
" message " which reaches the supraliminal intelligence is
misinterpreted by it, for in the first it did not mean a
rhinoceros and in the second it did not mean Buffalo Bill
I have assumed that the misunderstanding was supra-
liminal. It is, however, conceivable that it occurred
subliminally. The idea derived by the hypnotic stratum
from Myers's words 7nay have been m the first case a
rhinoceros and in the second Buffalo Bill. But in these
particular instances—at any rate the second—I think it
highly improbable that there was subliminal misunder
standing of what Myers said. The hippopotamus impres
sion was perhaps too vague to be worth discussing from
this point of view, for the same picture might have come
if Myers had said " rhinoceros " and therefore if the'
subliminal had wrongly understood " rhinoceros." But'
the idea " Buffalo Bill " by itself would I think have
produced a different picture, and one less appropriate to
Robinson Crusoe than that produced by Myers's story.
I think then that these cases (and others might be
quoted) sufficiently indicate that an idea, even when
successfully impressed on one stratum of consciousness
is liable to get distorted before it emerges in another, at
any rate when the transmission is effected by means of
1 " Buffalo Bill" was an American, touring the counti-y at this time
with a show representing the Wild West of America—a show which was
having a great success in this country.
Both the above experiments are quoted by Myers in Human Person
alily, and the first is quoted also in Proceedings, Vol. XIII. p. 59.3.

^ what Myers calls sensory or motor automatism. And I
think we may add that if an idea reaches the waking
f(
consciousness by such means, it is practically certain that
ed
it has been transmitted from a subliminal stratum. In
J,
automatic writing, at any rate when not followed at the
i time by the waking consciousness, ^ this is plainly so, for the
1
intelhgence using the hand is subliminal at the moment,
nt
so that if the writing contains ideas not in the supra-
i liminal stratum, they must issue from the subliminal.
eiiJhat the same is true in the case of ideas expressed
J
through sensory automatism—say a hallucinatory vision
—
lijiis hardly less obvious. For a vision which is first seen
ii
and then independently interpreted by the supraliminal
i
consciousness, must have been made up, so to speak,
]]
subliminally. The supraliminal intelligence is not aware
a.
that such a hallucination is being constructed until it
;(
perceives it.
I All this we shall have to take into account in examining
j
the hindrances encountered by telepathic messages. It is
5(
possible that all telepathic communication from outside
j first reaches a subliminal stratum of consciousness and
,j therefore has to run the gauntlet of passage from one
,j stratum to another before the supraliminal consciousness
J
is aware of it. That it has to do so when it emerges
jj
through sensory or motor automatism is I think certain.
[i(
It is worth noting that we are more accustomed than
III
we sometimes remember to a want of complete under-
ff
(Standing between two parts of our minds even when there
t(
is no question of any abnormal state. When, for instance,
in writing a letter, we write " there " for " their," it is

;i
spell what we do mean. It must be because the part of

our mind occupied with the spelling is attending to the

idea of the sound, and not to the idea of the meaning,

This seems to imply a subliminal element in the ordinary
operation of writing, which is co-operating imperfectly

with the waking intelligence.

' Df the aiitomatist is aware of what is being written varies throutrh
ilmost all possible degrees.
36 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part
Before concluding these preliminary observations and turn-
ing to particular cases of apparent obstruction in telepathic
messages, I must remark on a very important difference
in the evidence possible for telepathic messages from the
dead, and similar messages from the living. In the
latter we not only know the message received, but in
some cases (such as experimental ones) have independent
knowledge of the message sent ; and in others (such as
apparitions at the time of the death of the person seen)
at any rate know independently of some coinciding crisis
in the supposed sender's state. And in fact the coinci
dence between the message and what we know of the
supposed agent at the time, constitutes a very important
part of the evidence for telepathy. But in the case of
messages from the dead we can have no independent
means of knowing what passes on the supposed agent's
side. All we know is the message as received, and we'
can only judge from this whether a message was really
sent and what its contents were.
Even in messages from the living we cannot tell whether
the message emerges in a truncated, or distorted, or
otherwise altered form, unless we know exactly what
message was sent ; and this we can seldom know except
in experimental cases. It is chiefly, therefore, to ex
perimental cases that I shall refer in this paper. No
experiments have, so far as I know, been tried with a
view to discovering to what kind of alterations messages
are liable—mdeed it is difficult to see how such experi
ments could be carried out—we, therefore, have to ex-
amine those tried with the object of ascertaining the
existence of telepathy.
'
I shall illustrate what I have to say chiefly from the
following series of experiments pubhshed in our Pro-
ceedings.

regarding the experiments I shall quote as intended to

present an evidentially convincing case for the existence
Df telepathy. They are selected with an entirely different
{I
object, and the best and most startling successes in trans-
it
"erring ideas and images, would often be useless for my
I
3urpose. The mere fact that the idea gets through
jj
Dromptly and completely and without perceptible inter-
nediate stages, prevents any light bemg thrown on
jbstacles that may have been overcome.
1
38 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [pAKTj ^'^
On the other hand the cases where the " message
"
does not get through at all, and the percipient receives
no conscious impression concerning it, are also, as a rule,
useless for our present purpose, for they do not reveal
where the obstacle is.
A distinction must be drawn, however, between cases
where a particular would-be agent, or a particular would-
be percipient fails persistently, and the cases where, with
apparently unchanged conditions, failures occur in the
midst of successes. In the former telepathic incapacity in
agent or percipient would account for failure, but not in
the latter. And one would expect in failures amid
successes, to be able to discover the difference in con-
ditions which must exist and be the cause of failure.
Practically, however, little or nothing has been done in
|
this direction as yet. These failures amidst successes
remain unaccountable and are at present of no assistance
in our present quest. And the same is I think true of
another class of case, still more difficult to explain
—
those in which the percipient does have an impression
which to him has all the appearance of being veridical,
but which is in fact entirely wrong. In the Brighton
experiments it was noticed that some expectation of success
seemed required to produce any impression—wrong or
right. At any rate, in sets of experiments where agent
and percipient were separated by a greater distance than
usual (which, as already said (see p. 29 ) for some reason
hindered success), the absence of any impression was more
frequent than in unsuccessful sets with agent and per-
cipient together.
Impressions are sometimes accompanied by a feeling of
the operation of some sort of influence, the absence of
which may be noticed by the percipient when the " mess-
age " does not get through. When this happens it seems
possible that the want of success is due to the agent
faihng to give the message some necessary impulsive
quality. What I mean is well described by Sir Oliver
Lodge in discussing experiments with Mr. Guthrie's sub-
jects. Miss E. and Miss R. He says

With regard to the feehngs of the percipients when
receiving an impression, they seem to have some sort of
consciousness of the action of other minds on them ; and
once or twice, when not so conscious, have complained
that there seemed to be '
no power '
or anjrthing acting,
and they not only received no impression, but did not
feel as if they were going to. . . . They both say that
several objects appear to them sometimes, but that one
among them persistently recurs, and that they have a
feeling when they fix upon one, that it is the right one.
Sometimes they seem quite certain that they are right.
Sometimes they are very uncertain, but still right. Occa-
sionally Miss E. has been pretty confident and j^et quite
wrong. Proc, Vol. II., p. 200.
It would be interesting to know whether the nature of
he percipient's impression—visual, auditory, or mere idea,
;tc.—depends on the agent. It depends partly on sug-
gestion and expectation, and no doubt partly on the
jercipient's habit of mind ; but is there also some effect
produced directly though unintentionally by the agent,
md which would vary vt^ith different agents ? In the
Brighton experiments, one of the percipients—T.—made
I remark which may be instructive on this point. With
tfr. Smith as agent trying to transfer numbers, T.'s
mpressions, whether right or wrong, were generally
owing I think to our suggestion) visual, though he
sometimes complained of the numbers being " such a long
way off that you can hardly see them." But when Mx.
Myers or Dr. Leaf took the part of agent—in which,
jxperimenting with T., they were entirely unsuccessful
—
r., when asked whether he saw or heard the number
le named, said " No, I seem to imagine it " {Proc. Vol.
VI., p. 161). The non -success of these agents makes it,
lowever, improbable that their influence had any direct
jffect in producing this result. It is more likely that
r.'s subliminal represented to him in this way the absence
telepathic influence.
If we turn now to particular telepathic experiments, and
look first for light on the agent's part in the process,

something can perhaps be learnt from cases where two
or more agents acting simultaneously produce a mixed'
effect, or when an involuntary idea of one of them seems
to confuse or supersede the impression it was intended
to convey. The following case illustrates such superseding.
I give an abstract of Sir Ohver Lodge's report in Proc,
Vol. II., p. 198, concerning an experiment with Mr. Gutlirie's
percipients :
Agents : —0 J. L., Dr. Herdman, Miss R d, Miss R.
Percipient, Miss E. Object, " a teapot cut out of silver
paper.'' (Contact.)
Miss E. [said] " Something hght . . . No colour . . .
Looks like a duck. . . . Like a silver duck. . . . Something
oval . . . Head at one end, and tail at the other "...
She drew a rude and perverted copy of the teapot, but
" didn't loiow what it was unless it was a duck."
Dr. Herdman then explained that he had been thinking
aU the time how like a duck the original teapot was.
It may be objected that as Dr. Herdman had no
intention of transferring his irrelevant idea of a duck to
the percipient and there was therefore no voluntary
effort to project it, he cannot have been the effective
agent. This raises the whole question of the efficacy
of voluntary effort, and it is a difficult question. We
can say at once that voluntary effort is at any rate
not always necessary. For instance in the series of
experiments carried out by Mr. Wales and Miss Samuels (see
Proc, Vol. XXXI., pp. 124-217), the agent Mr. Wales made
no effort to transfer any particular ideas. Miss Samuels,
however, had impressions corresponding unmistakably to
thoughts of Mr. Wales or events in which he was con-
cerned. The activity and effort here seem to have been
entirely on the percipient's side. The same apjjarently
happens in some non-experimental cases. Compare for
instance a case in which Mrs. Verrall was apparently the
agent, described in Proc, Vol. XXVI., p. 44-46. It is
too long to quote in full here, but Mrs. Verrall sums up
her account of it by saying that it is "I think, indispu-
table that they [her daughter and a cousin, who were
LXXXIX.] Telepathic Commimication
.
41
table tilting] tapped thoughts of mine which I had
dehberately refrained from commmiicatmg to them." On
the other hand in IVIr. and IMi's. Newnham's experi-
ments the questions which of course he mtended she
should apprehend though she had no normal access
to them, reached her almost without fail. But answers
unknown to her, which might have been got out
of his mind, only appeared in her script in a very sHght
and fragmentary way. Is it possible that he inhibited
ithem—not voluntarily, but because they were Masonic
secrets, and thus as it were locked up in his mind ?
Intentional agency at any rate serves to mark a par-
ticular idea in the agent's mind, and to associate it with
the percipient, and it is possible that this makes it more
available to the latter, even if voluntary effort on the
1 agent's part has httle effect.
Returning for a moment to the duck and the teapot, we
must not ignore the possibility that Dr. Herdman contributed
little or nothmg to the result. The percipient may have been
struck with the resemblance of her impression to a duck
independently, though if so the idea of " teapot " was
apparently entirely obhterated by that of " duck." In
a case of Professor Gilbert Murray's, however, the per-
cipient must have caught by mistake an irrelevant idea
of a lady present. He got the impression of " kangaroos
"
when, as she thereupon reported, ^ she had been thinking
that a kangaroo or a bear with a visiting book (the idea
came from Punch) would be a good subject for experiment.
The actual scene the idea of which it was intended to
transfer was " Mr. L beating an egg at Siena."
[Proc, Vol. XXIX., p. 98, Exp. 66).
I have already suggested that telepathic messages first
reach the percipient subhminally. Erom analogy it is not
unlikely that it is in a subHminal part of the agent's
mind also that the eiiective action in telepathy takes
If
place. If so we can see that somehow the spontaneous
^
1 It is of course an evidential weakness, in the case of both duck and
f
kangaroo, that the supposed agent's idea was not mentioned till after
the percipient had spoken. At the same time a pseudo -memory does
not seem probable in either case.
42 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part
subliminal impulses conveying the ideas " Duck " and
" Kangaroo " in the experiments just described may have
been more powerful or more accessible to the percipient
than the deliberate impulses conveying the ideas intended.
The complication of simultaneous transference of different
ideas by different agents, or the transference of two ideas
from the same agents, does not necessarily produce con-
fusion. Sir Oliver Lodge tried two experiments illustrating
this. The following are accounts of them abstracted from
his records :
Li one {Proc, Vol. II., p. 196) two agents were set to
look at different drawings—a square and a cross like an
X —^neither Isnowitig Avhat the other was looking at. The
percipient Miss R., who did not know that anything
unusual was being tried, said, "I see things moving
about ... I seem to see two things ... I see first one
up there and then one down there ... I don't know
which to draw ... I can't see either distinctly." Told
anyhow to draw what she had seen, she drew first a
square, and then said, " Then there was the other thing
as well . . . afterwards they seemed to go into one,"
and she drew a cross inside the square from corner to
corner, addmg afterwards, " I don't know what made me
put it inside."
In the second the object was a tetrahedron outline rudely
drawn m projection—a triangle with Imes from the angles
meeting in the middle (Proc, Vol. II., p. 199). The
percipient Miss E. said " Is it another triangle " [A
triangle had been the subject of a previous experiment.]
No reply was given, but Sir Ohver silently passed round
to the agents a scribbled message, " Think of a ijyramid."
Miss E. then said, " I only see a triangle . .
." then
hastily, Pyramids of Egypt. No I shan't get this."
Asked to draw, she only drew a triangle.
A source of confusion occurs when in a series of experi-
ments the impression intended to be transferred in one
experiment does not emerge till the next—the agent
having meanwhile given vip the first and passed on to
something else. But in such cases, when not due to
uxxxix.] Telepathic Communication. •iS
3hance, the delay may be entkely in the percipient's mind
and thus be a case of gradual emergence. Some instances
will be found below. In the Brighton experiments, m
attempts to transfer double numbers, such deferred im-
pressions occurred on one occasion with two numbers
n succession, in the course of a rather successful set of
experiments.^
There are cases which suggest that attention devoted
successively to different parts of the object to be trans-
ferred, by the agent or percipient or both, led to success
when the attempt to transfer the whole had failed. The
following is a curious one. The attempt was to transfer
a name selected by IVIi'. Guthrie. I abstract from his
account :
He had just tried with the imagined name Patriclc,
with the result that the percipient said, "Is it Peter or
Patrick 1" He then thought of the name Jemima, this
time apparently writmg it down. Mr. Guthrie began as
sole agent but there were three or four others m the
room. In what follows the remarks in brackets are Mr.
Guthrie's. The percipient said, "Is it Lawrence ? No—
it looks hke a long name but I cannot see Avhat it is
a bit ... No .. . Angelo is it t
" (AU were now shown
the name and caUed upon to think.) . . ."It begins with
a J . . . Oh ! I see a J. (Mr. G. "Do you see the
letters as a whole 1 ") " I'll try to look at the letters.
Oh ! I can see five or sis letters, but can't get the
name." (Mr. G. "Then you see the letters. Well, take
it letter by letter. You've named the first letter ;
now
what is the next?") "Is it E?" (A'lr. G. "Right.
Now the thhd letter.") "M" (" Righl^the fourth
letter ? ") " I " (" Right—next letter "? ") " Two more,
hke C.A." (" A is right. Now look at the last letter but
one.") " E, I thmk." (N.B.—The subject had no idea
of the name nor of what letters had passed through her
mind so as to get the name.) {Proceedings, Vol. I., pp.
279, 280.)
It seems certain here that when the spelling letter by

44 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [PAET
letter began the agents (as well as the percipient) must
have concentrated on the letter required and that this
may have helped the percipient ; but her failure to grasp
the word as a whole combined with the almost complete
success in getting the individual letters is curious and
shows how very vague the picture of the whole, which
yet apparently existed in her mind, must have been.
This contrasts with the previous experiment (Peter or
Patrick, guessed for Patrick) where the guess seems to
have been made from a perception of at least part of the
name as a whole. Note also the dream-like amnesia for
the impressions that had just passed through her mind.
It almost looks as if the percipient had fallen into a
semi-trance state.
This experience brings us to the percipient's side
in the experiments, but before leaving the agent's side
it will be well to give a hst of the kind of subjects it
was attempted to transfer in the various series under
consideration. In a large number of cases it was simply
a visual sensation derived from gazing at some small
object
—
e.g. an apple or a key or a card or a number or
a diagram. It is a matter of some interest, but not
always easy to determine, whether when an impression
reaches the percipient, it is the idea, or the image, or the
name of it that reaches him first. To ehminate the name
some experiments have been successfully tried with name-
less diagrams—combinations of lines or irregular shapes
that cannot be described by a word or even by several
words. Sometimes the object gazed at was a rough
drawing by the agent, who thus probably reinforced the
impression on his mind. At other times there was no
actual external object before the agent, but he endeavoured
to transfer an imagined or remembered object or scene.
In such cases there was probably at least a visual element
in his mental impression and with some agents perhaps a
very strong one. In Mr. and Mrs. Newnham's experi-
ments there may have been a visual element in the
agent's impression as he wrote down the questions which
the percipient, without sight or knowledge of them,
was to answer by automatic writing. But so far
Lxxxix.] Telepathic Communication. 45
^3 we know there was no transference in visual form
of any such visual element. The percipient had no
conscious impression of the question, nor, except on one
occasion, of the answer,i till she read what the planchette
had written (see Proc, Vol. IIL, p. 12). Perhaps
attempts to transfer quotations, of which there are
one or two among Professor Gilbert Murray's experi-
ments (see Proc, Vol. XXIX., p. 102. Exps. 86 and 87)
should be classed with transferences of questions, as m
both the agent's impression, if visual, is of words. In
some of the experiments in which Miss L. Tipping was
the percipient {Proc. Vol. XXVIL, pp. 415-457) the agent
not only looked at an object but handled it and herself
executed movements in connection with it, and the
impression of these movements seems on several occasions
to have been transferred to the percipient in another room.
Of course this list of kinds of transference attempted
is far from exhaustive, even if we confine ourselves to
the series of experiments from which I have drawn
illustrations. Nor of course do these series include all
the series in our Proceedings. I have selected those
series and those individual experiments which seem to me to
throw most light on obstacles or aids to telepathic trans-
mission. I do not think that we have evidence to show
that among methods and objects of transference, one kind
is in itself more likely to succeed than another. But
there is little doubt that some kinds are better adapted
to some agents and percipients, and other kinds to others.
Such differences are very likely to arise both from self-
suggestion and from the degree of interest different kinds
of experiments may excite in different people.
I now turn to what is the more interesting and in-
structive part of our investigation—the percipient's side
of the transmission.
iThe one occasion was when, in answer to the unseen question,
"What name shall we give to our new dog?" the name ' Nipen '
(from Feats on the Fiord), not, by the way, thought of by the agent,
shot into the automatist's conscious mind, just as she was m the act
of automatically writing it down. (Proc, III., p. 23.)
46 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part
I believe, as already said, that what happens in the
typical case is that the telepathic impression first reaches
a subliminal part of the mind. From this it is trans-
mitted to the waking consciousness, emerging in various
ways—as by automatic writing, or in a visual or other
hallucination, or in a quasi-sensory mental impression,
or simply as an idea or otherwise. The impression thus
transmitted is often indistinct or otherwise obscure and
needs interpretation. There are obviously in this process
several opportunities for error to intrude. The impression
as subhminally received may be imperfect, there may be
defect or addition or distortion in the transmission from
the subliminal, and there may be misinterpretation of
the impression of which the percipient ultimately becomes
conscious. This misinterpretation moreover—due perhaps
to guessing or to irrelevant association of ideas—may
react on and modify the impression.
Further complication is added by the fact that the
imjiression sometimes is received, or at least emerges,
gradually, and premature transmission from the subliminal,
or premature interpretation may produce errors. For
instance, in one of Mr. and Mi's. Newnham's experiments
Mr. Newnham who had to preach on the following Whit-
Monday on the occasion of a Masonic ceremonial, asked
the question (unknown of course as usual to the per-
cipient) " Give me a text for Whit-Monday s sermon.
Mrs. Newnham wrote with the planchette, "If I go not
away, the Comforter will not come to you." Mr.
Newnham writes :
The selection of a subject suitable for Whitsuntide is
plainly the first idea caught by the mtelligence ; so I
proceeded :—" That will not do for my subject. I want a
text for the Monday's sermon." Ajiswer : "Let brotherly
love continue." (Proc, Vol. III., p. 21.)
Here the question was apprehended in two stages. ^
If the experiment had been stopped after the first, the
1 Perhaps in this case the impression first received by tlie subliminal
was Whit-Sunday—a mishearing as it were, for Whit-Monday. The idea
of Whit-Monday may only have reached it when the question was
mentally repeated.

k answer given would have been wrong, though it would
les have shown a partial apprehension of the question.
IS- Again with the same experimenters the unseen question
Ills asked being, " What do I mean by chaffing C. about a
let
lilac tree ?
" Planchette replied, " Temper and imagina-
)D.
tion." Now this answer apparently implied apprehension
US of the fact that there was something about chaff in the
question, for we are told that these two words formed
part of habitual family chaff, but the question as a
)i
whole had seemingly not been grasped. Mr. Newnham
therefore proceeded, " You are thinking of somebody else,
m Please reply to my question." The answer given was
" Lilacs," showing a further fragment of apprehension of
the previous question though still incomplete {Proc, Vol.
III., p. 23). It seems to have been a delayed impression,
for Mr. Newnham's second question did not contain the
word lilacs though he was of course thinking of lilacs.
Another complication is introduced in experiments in
which the subliminal mind of the percipient operates,
by its unwillingness at times to admit ignorance. IMr.
Newnham was much interested in Masonic archaeology, of
which Mrs. Newnham was completely ignorant. He on
several occasions asked questions relating to this which
required for their proper answer knowledge of Masonic
secrets. Answers more or less appropriate were generally
written, but were never correct. They were obvious
inventions, though sometimes showing fragments of know-
ledge beyond Mrs. Newnham's, of Masonic things. Here
is a specimen. The unseen question was :
Q. " Write out the prayer used at the advancement of
a Mark Master Mason."
A. " Almighty Ruler of the Universe and Architect of
all worlds, we beseech Thee to accept this, our brother,
whom we have this day received into our most honourable
Company of Mark Master Masons. Grant him to be a
worthy member of our brotherhood ; and may he be in
!
his own person a perfect mirror of all Masonic virtues.
Grant that all our dokigs may be to Thy honour and
glory, and to the welfare of all mankind."
48 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [pabt
[Mr. Newnham continues] This prayer was written off
instantaneously and very rapidly. It is a very remarkable
production indeed. For the benefit of those who are not
members of the craft, I may say that no prayer in the
shghtest degree resembling it is made use of m the Ritual
of any Masonic degree ; and yet it contains more than one
strictly accurate technicahty connected with the degree
of Mark Mason. ... I proceeded to inquire as follows :
:oiili
Q. " I do not know this prayer. Where is it to be
found ?
"
A. " Old American Ritual."
Q. " Where can I get one ?
"
A. " Most hkely none in England."
Q. " Can you not write the prayer that I make use of
in my own Lodge ?
"
A. "No, I don't Itnow it."
In these . . . answers we see a new moral element
introduced. There is evasion, or subterfuge, of a more or
less ingenious kind ; and totally foreign to the whole
character and natural disposition of the operator. A
similar attempt at deUberate invention, rather than plead
guilty to total ignorance, is contained in the following
answers." [Another case is then given by Mr. Newnham.]
(Proc, Vol. III., pp. 14 and 15.) i

The telepathic experiment here succeeded completely
Each question, though unknown to her supraliminal
consciousness, was evidently entirely apprehended by the
subliminal intelligence of the automatist and an answer
appropriate in form was written. But the answers were
pure invention, though the first one incorporated some
fragments of information which the percipient probably
found in the agent's mind. We seem to get here a lurid
light on the untrustworthiness of the subliminal self
when uncontrolled by the normal waking self—and serious

ossibilities of deliberate distortion of telepathic messages
) gratify subliminal vanity suggest themselves.^
If any one questions our right to attribute the futile
ttempt at deception to the percipient's subliminal self,
3 it might have been the work of another spirit, I
aould reply that the writing intelligence when questioned
s to its identity always asserted that it was Mrs. Newn-
am—" wife " as it expressed it ; and secondly that no
rue information was included which was unknown to both
gent and percipient. One of the things most puzzling
nd difficult to explain is the question raised by Mr.
[ewnham, why, when the percipient could get from the
gent's mind the question asked, she could not also get
com it the expected answer. This I have briefly dealt
nth. above, on p. 41.
There was at least one occasion when Mrs. Newnham
id apparently learn telepathically the answer as well as
he question, but the answer was very short. A pupil
i Mr. Newnham's, sceptical about the whole thing, was
Uowed to suggest a question on condition that Mr.
vTewnham saw it in writing. Mr. Newnham and his
tupil went outside the closed door of the room where Mrs.
Newnham was sitting with her planchette, and the young
aan wrote " What is the Christian name of my eldest
ister ?
" On returning to the room they found the
.nswer already waiting for them—" Mina." This was the
amily abbreviation of Wilhelmina, and was unknown to
dr. Newnham. It is implied that it was unknown to
tirs. Newnham also, and unless by some accident she had
it some time happened to learn what the sister was
ailed, she must, it will be observed, have learnt the answer
elepathically from the brother, even if the question was
/ransmitted as usual by her husband {Proc, Vol. III., p. 12).
An advantage of the percipient's impression emerging
n automatic writing is that there is little or no room for
1 It seems just possible that the frequent naming of a wrong niunber
vhen an impression of a number was expected—in e.g. the Brighton
xperiments, may have been partly due to a strong subliminal dislike

ntelligence, something, even if only a guess.

misinterpretation at the stage at which the waking inlj
telligence becomes aware of it. When the impressiorj m
emerges as a sensory halhxcination, this is otherwise
as we have akeady seen in cases where it had not beer,
received telepathically (see above pp. 33-35). The possi'
bilities of misinterpretation are of course liable to b€|
increased, when the hallucination develops gradually. In
some of the Brighton experiments, the percipient hypno-
tised by the agent, Mr. G. A. Smith, was set with opened,
eyes to look at a blank card, on which he was told he
would presently see a picture. The agent then tried to
concentrate his mind on an imaginary picture, of which
the subject had been chosen by Miss Johnson or myseU
and communicated to him in writing. The development
of the picture was as a rule slow. The following (see
Proc, Vol. VIII., p. 561) is the case in which it was, I
think, slowest and most fragmentary. The subject was
A Christy Minstrel with a banjo. The percipient (Miss B.j
said, " There's something long, something round in that
one—a little cage of some sort—something that looks like, jjj.
a cage ;
yet there's something like a handle.^ A can !
Oh, it's a can ! It's quite clear now." Without remark
about her impression we gave her a fresh card, and
continued to try to impress on her the same subject.
She said, " Something here dark—a hand." I asked,
"Is it a woman's hand or a man's ?
" To which Miss
B. replied, " A black hand."—which seemed a partia
success. At this point Mr. Smith had to wake Miss B.
in order to ask her when she had to go. Finding there
was still a little time to spare she was re-hypnotised
and another experiment tried. The subject this time was|
A sailing boat on the sea. This apparently made no
impression at the moment and Miss B. presently said
"A man—black—He's got something in his hand
—
a,n\
instrument—sort of guitar thing." Nothing had been;

^ Can she have been on the track of a banjo and have misled hersell

point into a ghost dressed in white with hands up. " You couldn't

aid about the Christy Minstrel and the banjo, so this
ardy emergence of the picture was striking. The waking
nd re-hypnotisation was evidentially a weakness, as it
avolved contact between agent and percipient. But on
he other hand the sequence of events strongly suggests
hat the full impression had reached Miss B. subliminally
rom the first, but had remained latent—only fragments
eing transmitted to the interpreting consciousness, until
he final picture got through.^
After this the attempt to make Miss B. see the sailing
oat was continued, but twice produced nothing but a
ague impression. Then Miss Johnson, who had remained
a ignorance of the subject of the joroposed picture in order
hat she might be able to talk to the percipient without
langer of giving indications, asked whether it was any-
hing like an animal. Miss B. said, " No—got some
)rong sort of things—something at the bottom like a little
)oat—What can that be up in the air ? —Cliffs I supx^ose
—cliffs in the air high up—it's joining the boat—oh,
ails—a sailing boat—not cliffs—sails." This was not all
ittered consecutively but partly in answer to questions
)ut by Miss Johnson in order to stimulate the percipient's
ittention {Proc, Vol. VIII., p. 561).
In this case until the picture was grasped as a whole,
he elements of it seem to have been seen rather vaguely,
n the one to be now qvtoted {Proc, Vol. VIII., p. 565),
he elements of the picture emerged in a piecemeal manner,
)ut each was definite when it came. The subject was
4 sandwichman with advertisement of a play. The per-
iipient—P.—said, " Something like letter A—stroke there,
ihen there." I said, "Well perhaps it will become clearer."
continued, " 8omething like a head on the top of it ;
I V upside down—two legs and then a head.—A man
ivith two boards—looks like a man that goes about the
streets with two boards. I can see a head at the top
md the body and legs between the boards. I couldn't
jee what was written on the boards, because the edges

ip the sensory automatism, nor that which interpreted it, was Miss

were turned towards me." This case is interesting,
because notwithstanding the gradual emergence and tardy
understanding of the hallucinatory picture there is strong
reason to think that it was the idea of a sandwich man,
and not a copy of the agent's mental image, that reached
the subliminal stratum of the percipient's mind. For the
agent—Mr. Smith—stated afterwards that he had pictured
to himself the man and one board facing him. And this
was the natural way to think of it, since the subject set
included the advertisement of a play, which of course
would only be seen if the board faced the spectator.
The percipient's impression was incomplete.
Sometimes when, accordmg to the percipient's description,
the development of the picture has reached a point at
which one would have expected the interpretation to be
obvious, the latter lags somewhat. Thus (see Proc,
Vol. VIII., p. 562) the subject fixed on for the picture
being a man and woman dancing, P. after long waiting
said he saw " A man and a girl there—a lady and
gentleman.—He's got his arm round her waist—^they're
valsing or dancing something or other " ; each point being
stated with an air of discovery, and the arm round the
waist not at first suggesting the dancing.
On the other hand the idea sometimes came before the
picture had completed itself. Thus (Proc, Vol. VIII.,
p. 568) the subject for the picture being A mouse in a
mouse-trap ; P. said, " I can see something—some lines
coming " (pause) " still 'those lines and something like

oh, I think I know what that's going to be. Is that
meant for a mouse trap ?
" I asked, " Any mouse ?
"
P. said : "I think it looks as if the mouse were trying
to poke its nose through the bars. I don't think it's
fancy." ^
It was possible to have a false picture competing more
or less with the true one. Thus {Proc, VIII., p. 267)
the subject on one occasion was A snake with its forked
tongue out. P. said, " I thought I saw something like
one of those men with an ice-cream barrow—caught a

"—then
—" I just thought I could see some-
rhing like a snake. I can see it now still—something
ike a snake-charmer there playing with it—isn't afraid of
t a bit. I'm not going to say this is it yet, because I
aw the ice-cream barrow just now. It seems a most
illy thing to see a snake after an ice-cream barrow—but
;hat went and this stays longer—stiU there." The whole
experiment lasted ten minutes. We may observe that
)esides the irrelevant impression, there was what one may
;all embroidery on the telepathic idea—the addition of
;he snake-charmer to the snake. P.'s hypnotic imagina-
tion must have concerned itself actively with the impressions
le received on this occasion. P. said once {Proc, Vol.
VIII., p. 563), " You could easily fancy anything that
3ame into your head."
One evening we got Miss B. to see a hallucinatory
picture and to write with a planchette at the same time
[see Proc, Vol. VIII., p. 262-3). Five experiments were
bried, in two of which there was a visual impression
mth closed eyes), but nothing legible was written. In
a third there was no visual impression and the writing
was wrong. In only two did both methods of externalis-
ing the impression operate. In one of these the results
of the two methods differed markedly from each other
and both were completely wrong. There was some
approximation to the desired impression in the remaining
case. The subject was A cow being milked by a dairy-
maid. Miss B. said, " there's an animal I can see, a
big one too—biggish looking—got some horns I think.—
It's a buffalo." She saw nothing besides the buffalo
and said it was standing up. In the meanwhile the
planchette had written " Cow." A few experiments in
number-guessing were also tried, in which Miss B., while
trjing for visual impressions of numbers looked at by the
agent, at the same time had her hands on a table, tilting
it, here too the results of the two processes were dis-
cordant.
The possibihty of impressions developing differently
according to the method by which they reach the in-
terpreting mtelhgence, or of different impressions, whether

veridical or not, competing in this way for attentio
again opens up vistas of opportunities for confusion.
When we pass, as we must now do, from impressioi leffl
emerging in sensory or motor automatism to those pe
ceived as mental images or sensations, or simply as ide<
or words, we can seldom trace the operation of tl
subliminal with the same certainty. The telepath
impact—so far as appears in many of these cases—ma
reach the waking intelhgence dnect. I am inclined to thin!
however, from analogy, that telepathic communication i
at least as a rule, a subliminal affair and that when thiiii
development of the conscious impression in the cases
are about to consider is gradual or incomplete, it may liii
due, just as in some of the cases above considered, tiClii
difficulty in passing from subhminal to supraliminal lli
and we shall find certain cases where the operation c
the subliminal intelhgence is strongly indicated.
I will begin with impressions visual but not hallucinator
—not externalised, and illustrate with two cases from Mi
Guthrie's experiments where the general form and appeal
ance of an object gazed at by the agent seems to hav
been gradually apprehended by the percipient but not a
first its name or meaning. Indeed the first was definitel
misinterpreted.
Object looked at Mr. B's watch held at some little distanc
behind the percipient. Percipient says : "Is it bright
round ... Is it a button." {Proc, Vol. I., p. 266.)
Object looked at a dark crimson apple. Percipien
says, "Is it round ? . . . a dark red shade . . . like
knob off a drawer. ... It is an apple." {Proc, Vo
I., p. 268.)
The interpretation " button " was, it would seem, ,
guess based on an imperfect visual impression. " Apple
may have been a guess too—not a real interpretation
We cannot tell. Moreover, it is probable that when f
guess or an interpretation is made it reacts on the im
pression and makes this clearer. Some cases suggesting
this will be quoted below ; and we have had evidenc(
above, pointing to this kind of action and reaction be

ween interpretation and hallucinatory pictures. And as
, matter of fact the same thing happens to us in real
ion perceptions of external things either not very clearly seen
peiir heard, or capable of more than one interpretation.
^
lea I have distinguished between interpretation and guessing,
lut I must allow that the distinction is not a very well-
tlii narked one, whether we are concerned with perception of
iia external objects or with mental images telepathically
uii )riginated. Indeed in a certain sense our interpretations
iii)f sensory impressions might all be called guesses. I
im, however, usmg the word guess to mean an interpreta-
..ion which carries no conviction, at any rate before the
li-uess is accepted and the image has adapted itself to it.
t(Chus in the first of the above-mentioned experiments
.he mental image seems to have been of a bright round
)bject at an uncertain distance and therefore of an
mcertain size.^ Casting about for an explanation, the
dea of a button suggested itself as a possible one, but
}here was no feeling of certainty about it. The per-
3ipient's mental image was not obviously that of a button
a,nd recognised as such. In the second experiment, shape,
3olour and size (the drawer knobs of a chest of ckawers
being of much the same size as an apple) are appre-
hended, and the mental image becomes complete and is
recognised by the percipient as an apple. Of course m
thus figuring to ourselves the process in the percipient's
mind, there is much of conjecture. All we know is what
the agents intended and what the percipient is reported
to have said, to which we may add the experience we all
have of the process of ordinary sensory perception.
It may be worth dwelling on this last a little because
of the importance of its bearing on the interpretation of
mental images telepathically received. Perception of ex-
ternal objects is in effect the interpretation of sensory
impressions. Taking for simplicity one sense only, the
sense of sight ;—when we say we see anything—a book for
iii
instance—we mean of course that certain sensations have
i^j affected the retina, which with the aid of previous know-
i For want of recognition of size and consequent confusion compare
one of Miss Tippings experiments quoted below p. 62:

ledge—such as what a book is hke, the probabihty thai
a book would be in the place where it appears to be
and so forth—we interpret as a book. Actually if th(
presence of a book in that place is expected, very slighl
sensory impressions will be perceived as a book, and we
may in such a case interpret as a book something ir
fnost respects entirely different. Again, when there ii
Httle of expectation to guide us, and owing to bad lighl
or other cause the visual sensation is unusually imperfect
we are sometimes compelled to guess considerably beyond
what our visual sensations justify. Mistakes are ofter
made in semi-darkness in this way. Selection is anothei
element in the process of perception which may eithei
help or hinder correct apprehension. Most of our visua]
perceptions are effected by a selection of such lines and
colours among those presented to us, as we can combine
into the image of a probable object. Amusing use is
made of this fact in those puzzle pictures representing in
the same picture two entu-ely different subjects. One
interpretation first strikes us as obvious, but when we
have succeeded in perceiving the other, it is sometimes
quite difficult to perceive the first again at all.
I will quote next some cases where I think it is pretty
certain that no " guess " was made. The percipient's
experience seems to ha^e been of the nature of a gradu-j
ally developing visual image in the mind, interpreted as'
the development proceeded. In the first the image re-
mained vague and indistinct to the end and it seems
possible that an initial misinterpretation by the percipient
about branches hindered the proper development. The
impression may have been like the puzzle pictures just
referred to.
Object looked at by agents, A small toy dog, coloured
light brown, with tail extended and in the act of leaping.
Percipient says :—" Is it green ? . . . I can see something
like a lot of branches. . . . Can't count them—look too
many—hke a long stem—so—" (tracing a horizontal fine
m the air) " with thmgs down " (tracmg fines downwards)
" Looks to be a fighter colour now . . . not green as at

first . . . but now it looks like an animal. Can't see
any more. {Proc, Vol. I., p. 268.)
Object. A jug cut out of white card board. Percipient
says, " Camaot see any colour . . . looks all light . .
.Is
it a cup ? There is a handle ... oh it is a jug."
(Proc, Vol. I. p. 269.)
Object : A pair of scissors, standing open and upright.
Percipient says : ''Is it silver . . . No—it is steel. . . .
It is a pair of scissors standing upright." {Proc, Vol. I.,
p. 267.)
In the following case it is certain that there was no
guess. There was an apprehension—probably vague—of
a shape, but no idea attached to it. Experiments were
being made with rough drawings as objects. When the
percipient thought she had a correct impression she
unbandaged her eyes and attempted to draw the im-
pression she had had. On one occasion the agent di-ew
and gazed at a rough representation of a horse. It was
extremely bad, but nevertheless that it was meant for a
horse or something like one was unmistakable. The
percipient's reproduction, also extremely rough, unmis-
takably resembled the original, though not at all like a
horse. Almost all that constituted the resemblance of the
origmal to a horse had been eliminated. The percipient
in fact cannot have had the idea of a horse in her mind,
though she must have had a vague impression of the
lines of the original. (See Proc, Vol. II., p. 42, where the
drawings are reproduced).
In Baron von Schrenck-Notzing's experiments with
roughly drawn diagrams there are instances where the
correct impression is approached through two or tliree
wrong ones, perhaps not derived from the original at all.
This may be a mode of gradual development, but on the
other hand it may merely be that the percipient has a
multiplicity of impressions among which she, as it were,
feels about for the right one. (See diagrams 14 and 15
in the sheets of diagrams following p. 22 of Proc, Vol.
VII.)
In the mental impressions discussed above, it was, 1
think, clearly the image of the object to be transferred

that reached the percipient. What she grasped, partially,
or completely, was the external appearance. But there arej
other cases where it is equally clearly the idea rather
than the image that is apprehended. This is well seen
in ]\'Ir. Rawson's experiments [Proc, Vol. XI., pp. 1-17).
In these the agent and percipient each sat with block and
pencil before her and the latter tried to reproduce what
the former, unseen by her, was drawing. Sometimes
the reproduction was nearly exact (as in the two pigs ori
p. 4) and there is nothing to show whether it was the
image or the name that was transmitted. Sometimes, on
the other hand, it seems clearly to have been the idea
or the name of the object that the percipient appre-
hended ;
as when she drew a hand (p. 4) in a totally
different position from that drawn by the agent, and
similarly a ring (p. 5), or a clock and again a 'chak,
different in character from those the agent had drawn
(pp. 10 and 11). It must, however, have been the
impression of form that converted a waste-paper basket
into a barrel (p. 10). And it is very difficult to say
what happened when the agent drawing a match-box, the
percipient drew what was even more suggestive of a
match-box but in a different position, and then failed to
interpret her own drawing (pp. 15 and 16). " I don't
know what I have drawn," she said, "it is a kind of
square inside a square." •
The " square inside a square,"
resembling the strip of luminous paint on some match-
boxes, did not appear in the agent's match-box.
In one experiment in this series in which a nearly
exact replica of the agent's drawing—a nose—was made,
the percipient apparently first apprehended the idea of
the object, or perhaps its function. She said, "I can
think of nothing ;
I can only hold my nose," and presently
proceeded to draw the nose herself (pp. 9, 10). In one
of the experiments of Messrs. SchmoU and Mabire series
it was pretty clearly the function of the object rei^resented
by the cbawing—that of a musical instrument—that
first reached the percipient's consciousness. The object
was a rough drawing of a lyre—its frame resembling the
outline of a vase with a foot. It had four wires up the
f/ir

middle connected by a bar across the top. After two
minutes the percipient said :
" I have got the notion of a flute—or of some musical
instrument or other." (a little later) "I see many Unes.
It resembles a vase, but it is not a vase." She then
cbew and said " Now it is Uke a harp ;
there are several
strings—Uke a httle gridiron."
At the end of the experiment she handed to the agents
I five drawings showing a progressive resemblance to the
object or parts of it, and ending with one very fakly
complete. Here although the idea of some musical
instrument was the first thing apprehended by the per-
cipient, subsequent impressions seem to have been almost
wholly of form {Proc, Vol. V., p. 190 and for facsimiles
of drawings p. 213).
The point raised above of the reaction of the per-
cipient's interpretation on his impression is illustrated
rather clearly, I think, by an experiment in Messrs.
SchmoU and Mabire's series (Proc, Vol. V., p. 181, and
for facsimiles of drawings, p. 210). The object was
three horizontal lines of unequal lengths connected by a
vertical line at their left end. It was hke a letter E with
its horizontal lines enormously prolonged, and it was not
intended to represent anything. After a few minutes
the percipient said, "I see three fish on a skewer."
Not being well understood she explained :
—" Three fish
held by a skewer, that is as they are sold in the fish-
markets ; but everybody knows that !
" Then she took
off her bandage and drew a very rough representation
of three fish lying parallel, with a skewer through their
heads. Apparently a mental image of three parallel
J
lines, suggested three parallel fish and was then modified
e to fit the interpretation.
s A more unfortunate example of development on wrong
i lines, due apparently to ideas introduced by the per-
t cipient in attempts at interpretation, is afforded by one
t of the experiments of the Misses Tipping [Proc, Vol.
e XXVII., p. 420). The object experimented with was
e a gold watch bracelet. Miss K. Tippmg sat at the table
Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [far%
holding the bracelet up and turning it round and round
in her hands. Miss L. Tipping in another room (the,
experiments were made at the S.P.R. rooms) said :
You are sitting at a table in a well ht room—the
fire seems burning brightly—great sense of comfort—and
you are holding a small round smooth object, bright in
colour. You have picked it up and keep turnmg it
round, your hands seem movuig much. It is glowmg
colour—orange is the colour I get and its colour is its
attraction. The object seems very cold and smooth,
and a great feehng of roundness comes to me."
So far the description is fairly good and in some
respects very good. But at this point the percipient
gets off the right track altogether—misled perhaps by the
idea of a round orange-coloured object. She goes on :
" I sense a warm country and dark people movmg
about—pickmg up fruit—long groves of trees—blue sky—
and very sunny. Is it fruit you are holdhig ? I get
many objects of the same shape. I can't make out if
it is an orange, or some kmd of fruit with plenty of
juice. I seem to be tastmg fruit of some kind."
In the following experiment in Professor Gilbert Murray's
extremely mteresting series {Proc, Vol. XXIX., p. 105)
initial misinterpretation by the percipient affected all that
followed. The idea to be transferred was "The little
crocodile on the Captain's trunk and him showing it to
Isabel a7id me." The percipient said, "Where's Denis's
lizard gone ?—because I thought it was Denis's lizard
pursumg you and Isabel—the lizard on a bed in a cabin
and you and Isabel lookmg at it." It was not un-
natural to mistake a Uttle crocodile for a known lizard,
especially if the impression thus mistaken was a rather
vague visual or semi-visual one. And it must be allowed
that, notwithstanding this mitial error, the percipient got
remarkably near to the agent's idea.
Associated ideas sometimes impress themselves before
the idea intended is grasped. Thus in one of Mr
Gutlirie's experiments {Proc, Vol. IL, p. 35) the object
lave

Jid ooked at was a rough bid rather spirited drawiyig of a fish,
ii ipparently swimming. The percipient said almost directly,
'
are you thinking of the bottom of the sea with shells
^.
md fishes ?
" And then, "Is it a snail or a fish ?
"
, The figure she proceeded to draw was distinctly a very
"
:air imitation of the original, but justified, in a way which
^ the original did not, the doubt whether it was a snail or
a, fish. The idea of the bottom of the sea may of course
have originated with the agent or the percipient.
1^' In the next case the agents were probably responsible
'
since the association of ideas was involved in the selection
of the- object to be transferred. Mr. Guthrie writes
[Proc, Vol. II., p. 30) :
" One evening [during a visit to London] I called Miss
E and a friend of mine . . . out of the room, and re-
quested them to assist me in imagining the large stained
ig
glass rose-window in the transept of Westminster Abbey,
opposite to which Miss E, Miss E, and I had been
't
sitting at the service the same afternoon. I then asked
f Miss R to say what object we were thinking of. After
'f
a while she said, " I cannot tell what you are lookmg at,
but I seem to be sittmg m Westminster Abbey, where
we were this afternoon." After another interval she
i|
said, " I seem to be looking at a window," and again,
J
"I thmk it is the window in the chancel with the figures."
J
When afterwards told which window it was, she said that
J
she did not see any wmdow distinctly, and certainly not
,
the rose-window thought of.
i
In the following case association of ideas
—
Mx. Keir
1
Hardie suggesting the Labour Party—misled the percipient
•
Professor Gilbert Murray, though the result was an amus-
1
ing derivation from the original. The impression to be
f
conveyed was Keir Hardie blacking boots. The percipient
said, " Hunter's shoes. Labour Party with exceedingly
bright boots " {Proc, Vol. XXIX., p. 99). One cannot,
of course, be sure that what the agent actually transferred
was what she intended to transfer, but if it was, it seems
clear that though the idea of Keir Hardie failed to
emerge in the percipient's conscious impression it must
62 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [pabiI
have been tliere latent in his mind, and so must the idea
of boots being blacked. It looks, in fact, as if the com-
plete idea intended reached the percipient subhminally
all right, but evolved itself otherwise in the course of
emergence into consciousness.
There are other mental processes besides association of
ideas which may interfere with the successful emergence
of telepathically received impressions. One is a tendency
to ignore or reject ideas that the conscious intelligence
dislikes or that seem to it absurd or unlikely to
be meant. This probably happens a good deal with
some percipients and might easily happen without our
knowing anything about it. Here are two instances
where this kind of inhibition nearly prevailed :
In one of the Brighton experiments, P. was to see on
a card a hallucinatory picture of A spider in the middle
of its web. After some time he said :
"Now I can see something-—funny shape—don't loiow
what it is either—not quite round—octagonal in some
places—hnes across it—more sides than eight—some broken.
If I was to compare it with anything, it would be a
spider's web ;
but it can't be that. There would never
be a picture of a spider's web." {Proc, Vol. VIII p
568.)
In one of the experiments of the Misses Tipping
agent and percipient being in different rooms—the
agent occupied herself mainly with opening and closing
an umbrella, dancing during part of the time while she
did so. The percipient's account of her impression began
"your hand seems moving up and down," and then
diverged into what might be the description of a small
table bell, the kind that is struck by pressing down a
knob. She ended her written description with, " You
lift up your hand and let it fall. Several times you do
this. The shape seems hke a doll's umbrella, with a
little slender stem." She afterwards, but before receiving
any hint of what the experiment had been, said :
" the impression she had got was of her sister moving
her hand up and down rhythmically . . . She saw an
0
lit
to (

;ej object like a mushroom, and, wondering what it was,
a- had kept on thinking of a wee doll's umbrella which she
!1t had had when a child. She tried to banish the impression
i as irrelevant." (Proc, Vol. XX^^I., pp. 426-428.)
(It looks as if mushroom shape here had suggested
i nusliroom size, and so the toy umbrella mstead of a real
t Dne.)
=y Another source of confusion is liable to occur when the
'X
.dea to be transferred goes beyond what the percipient's
i'j
mind can construct from material at its disposal. Thus
Dr. Ermacora tells us that in a dream impressed on a
1'
3hild between four and five years of age, a lamb figured.
^ The child lived at Venice and had never seen a live lamb.
The animal that duly appeared was accordingly inter-
s preted by her as a light -coloured dog.^ {Proc, Vol. XI.,
pp. 251,^252).
But it is not only mental habits and associations that
- are liable to afiect the impression that reaches the per-
. cipient's normal waking intelligence. Outside things actu-
. ally occurring or existing contemporaneously sometimes
3
seem to mix themselves •
in and play a part in the result.
One of the quaintest cases was when the edge of the
[ card P. was looking at, cut off part of the hallucinatory
picture
—
a vase ivitli flowers—which he should have seen.
This is what P. said :
I see something round, hke a round ring. I can see
some straight thmgs from the round thing. I think
it's a glass—it goes up. I'll tell you what it is ;
it must
be a pot—a floAver pot you know with things growing in
it. I only guessed that because you don't see things
growing out of a glass. ^—Ifs not clear at the top yet.

1 The case in which this incident occurred is too long and complicated
to quote here, but I strongly recommend those interested in telepathy,
who do not happen to remember Dr. Ermacora's accovmt of his Ex-
periments in Proc, Vol. XI., pp. 235-308, to read it. The experiments
are of quite an unusual kind, and the fulness of telepathic contact
manifested in them between the sleeping percipient and the secondary
self (as it probably was) of the agent, is very remarkable.
2 The impression was evidently confused, which may have been due
'-
to distraction in the agent, who, while thinking of a vase with flowers,
i sat actually facing a pot with a growing india-rubber plant in it.
64 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [pari
You see something going up and you can't see the topj jj
because of the edge of the paper—it's cut off. I don't
wonder, because it's no good wondering what Mr. Smith
[the agent] does, he does such funny thmgs. I should
fancy it might be a geranium, but there's only sticks,
so you can't tell. (Proc, Vol. VIII., pp. 565, 6.)
Two cases of percipients being apparently aided or
influenced by an object in front of them are recorded by
Mr. Rawson. In the first the agent drew a clock. The
percipient, Mrs. L, began drawing within ten to fifteen
seconds and presently said, "I am drawing something I
can see." She sketched the clock in front of her on the
mantelpiece, which was, however, quite unlike the agent's
clock—a wall clock with weights. {Proc, Vol. XI pp 10
11).
The second case was more curious. The agent's drawing
represented a sand glass. This was unknown to Mr.
Rawson. He writes':
Mrs. B. [the percipient] after waitmg some three minutes
said, " I can't think of anything." In about fifteen
seconds more she called me and said, " Look here,"—
pointing to a gilt four-leaved shamrock like this [drawing
of it given] which formed an ornament at the corner of a
picture, frame in front of her as she sat at a table with
her back to Mrs. L. [the agent] ... " Look here, Mr.
Rawson, I was looking vacantly before me and I noticed
this. It's the only idea I have and I will draw it."
When I looked at her drawmg I was astonished to see
that she had only drawn two leaves of the shamrock, and
those the two [opposite each other] which exactly re-
semble the interior of a sand glass. (See Proc, Vol. XI.,
p. 15, where the drawings are reproduced.) i ^
h
The mental process here is somewhat obscure, but it
looks as if the idea ^ of the object to be transferred had
1 I say idea rather tlian form, because the percipient's drawing cor- 4,
responded to the glass part of the sand glass—the essential part of it.
It ignored the stand, which was prominent in the form of the agent's
drawing. It is of course possible that the succe.ss here was nurelv >

een grasped subliiiiinally, and to get it apprehended
upraliminally the subUminal intelligence had picked out
he lines in the shamrock corresponding to the form of a
and glass as one picks out lines and marks in glowing
oal when one sees faces in the fire.
In Professor Gilbert Murray's experiments several cases
re noted where some external fact or occurrence seemed
3 suggest or stimulate the right idea, not as it did in
lie above cases, but by some sort of association of ideas.
will quote three.
Subject to be transferred, Ghost of Strafford coming in to
see Charles I., when John Inglesant was page-in-waiting.
Percipient says, " I think this is wrong. I'm going
to guess it is a ghost. (A light through the window sug-
gested a ghost.) I should say a sort of Cavaher ghost
appearing in the evening. I should think it is in a book.
Charles I. appearing to anybody—ghost appearing to
Charles I.—(guessmg) Strafford." {Proc, Vol. XXIX.,
p. 94.)
Subject, Cousin B having his eyes examined by Mr.
C . Percipient says :
" An oculist, C -, examining
the eyes of B " (suggested by one of the company
moving her spectacles). {Proc, Vol. XXIX., p. 98.)
Subject, Savonarola having the pictures burnt in Florence
and standing up and a crowd round. Percipient says,
" It's Itahan—I think it's something in a book. Well,
this is the merest guess and may have something to do
with the spark that came out of the fire—I get a smell
of burning, the smell of a bonfire—I get Savonarola burn-
ing the pictures in Florence." {Proc, Vol. XXIX., p. 104.)
Professor Murray in his Presidential Address discusses
he influence of such external events. He says {Proc,
'o\. XXIX., p. 59) :
Now for some experiments, where the subconscious
impression chose some sense-channel by which to reach
3cidental. The reason for thinking otherwise, besides the large amount
I telepathy manifested in the series, is that the selection of the portion
f the shamrock drawn is a very odd one if purely arbitrary, and is
scounted for if prompted telepathically.

thought of Savonarola at Florence and the people burnini
their clothes and pictures and valuables in the square.-
I first felt, "This is Italy," then, "This is not modern"
and then hesitated, when accidentally a small tarry bit o
coal tumbled out of the fire, I smelt oil or paint burning
and so got the whole scene. It seems as though hen
some subconscious impression, struggling up towards eon
sciousness, caught hold of the burning coal as a means o:
getting through. (I am sorry to use metaphorical Ian
guage, but exact language would be both difficult anc
cumbrous.) In this case then the information came'
through the sense of smell.
Mrs. Verrall, who reported on the whole series ol
experiments, makes some interesting comments on this
passage in the address—she says {Proc, Vol. XXIX i
p. 85) :
',
The subjective impressions of the percipient as to method'
are always valuable, and Professor Murray has given us con-
crete examples of each of the suggested processes. But a
considerable familiarity with this type of phenomena, both!"
as critic and as percipient, leads me to warn the reader
that, though the subjective impression is no doubt accu-
rately noted, we must not accept it unchallenged as an
explanation of the process. In other words, while we
may grant, for instance, that the smell of a tarry coal
which fell from the fire was the means of translating a
subconscious impression into a conscious thought of the
burning pictures, it is not safe to infer that such an
incident is a necessary part of the process. In the
unusual condition induced by a dehberate desire to plunge
below the threshold and bring back spoil from the depths,
the mind grasps eagerly after something familiar, and—
I speak at least of my own sensations—is relieved at
seizing a solid fact, withm normal experience, to which
it may attach the half -apprehended object of its search.
The percipient's mind being thus, so to say, on the look
out for such a Imk, fastens on the falling coal, but had
the coal not fallen, it is capable of finding some other

link, or even of forging one. Thus in one of his instances
^ of a fictitious association of ideas, Professor Murray
~
speaks of hearing a horse in the road outside : "I have
a noise of hoofs. I expect it's the noise of hoofs in the
'
street that makes me think of it." But in the con-
^ temporary record of the note-taker we read :
" No noise
of hoofs in the street." ^
^
It is a frequent feature of telepathic " messages, '
and
le fact appears in a good many of the cases discussed
bove, that the percipient's imiDression, even when clear
nd correct as far as it goes, does not give the whole
message." This is a very important thing to keep in
lind when estimating the value of information tele-
i athically received. Telepathy, as we know it, even if it
^' ere more readily available than it is, could not be
V ;lied on like telegraphy to convey a message accurately
ad fully ; and the message often stops short of com-
^ leteness for no obvious reason. I will conclude my
samination of develojoment of telepathic impressions, by
J
uoting two cases illustrative of this fact. In both the
^ansmission is very successful as far as it goes. In the
rst it is also very prompt. In the second the idea
^1
merged by stages.
The first is one of Baron von Schrenck-Notzing's ex-
j, eriments. He, in one room, drew The staff of Msculapius
jl
ith the serpent. The percipient, Fraiilein A., in another
. )om with the door closed drew at the same time a
lake—or at least a wavy line with a head and a tail
JsembUiig the agent's snake. But there was no staff,
erhaps the percipient had not heard of the staff of
,j
llsculapius, and so the idea failed to reach her ; and
, le report leaves it uncertain whether she even interpreted
er own rough drawing as a snake. In any case, how-
.j
;^er, it is certain that the staff was not represented either
I
I form or in idea. {Proc, Vol. VII., p. 12, and page 6

The second incomplete impression I shall quote is one

: Professor Murray's. The subject to be impressed—-a

purely imaginary one—was Celia NetvboU under a gourd
tree at Sfnyrna. The percipient said, " Modern Greek oi
some kind—sort of Asia Minor place—a tree and womeii
sitting under it—a particular tree—girl sitting undei'
it—she does not belong to the place—she is English
—
something to do with a poet ^—can't be Mrs. Kipling'
—no it's a girl—rather like one of the 0 s—don't
think I can get her." (Proc, Vol. XXIX., p. 107, also
p. 66.)
Here each item as it emerges is correct or immediately
corrected, and the whole scene, as it were, is grasped
;
but the percipient fails to recognise either the identity
of the lady or the exact place, though both are ex-
tremely prominent in the original idea, and though char-
acteristics of both emerge in the impression.
I have now, I think, sufficiently shown that there are
obstacles or at any rate difficulties in the way of tele-
pathic transmission which easily may, and in fact often
do, interfere with the process, and prevent a " message
"
being received as the sender intended. Apart from
difficulties on the agent's own side, and even when a
message has apparently safely reached some part of the
percipient's mind, it may fail to pass successfully from
that to the normal waking consciousness. And this not
only because the impression is sometimes too feeble to
prevail, but because as transmitted to the normal con-
sciousness the latter may fail to interpret it. And the
difficulties may be aggravated by differences in the results,
according as different modes of externalisation—different
methods of transferring the subliminal impression to the
normal consciousness—are used, and even by deliberate
invention in the subliminal mind.
The amount of light thrown incidentally in the course
of our investigation on the telepathic process is I fear not
very great. But I think there is some, and indeed
enough to give good grounds for hope that, as our ac-
cumulation of telepathic occurrences, spontaneous and

SUPPLEMENT.
A TEXT-BOOK OF METAPSYCHICS.i
Review and Ceitiqite by Sir Oliver Lodge.
The object of Professor Richet in writing his great wov.
Traite de Metapsycliique is to introduce Psychical Researc
as a serious scientific study into the Universities, and t(
get it recognised as the beginnings of a real science.
He considers that the stages through which the subjec
has already passed are :
1. The Mythical ;
up to Mesmer (1778).
2. The "Magnetic"; from Mesmer to the Fox sisten
(1847).
3. The Spiritist ; from the Fox sisters to WiUiair
Crookes (1847-1872).
4. The Scientific ; which begins with William Crookei
(1872).
and he expresses a hope that this book wall help to inaugurate
a fifth period, which he calls " The Classic," being that o:
scientific recognition.
But he reahses and sympathises with the great difficulty
which men of science feel on encountering facts of a different
order from any to which they are accustomed. The forces
with which the investigation deals are intelhgent forces : ali
other forces as yet studied by men of science are bhnd forces

ievoid of self-consciousness and caprice ; in other words,
sdthout personality or wiU.. Whereas intellectuaUty, Avill,
md intention,—which may not be human but which resemble
mman will and intention,—are characteristic of metapsychic
jhenomena. Such phenomena seem due to unknown but
nteUigent forces, including among these unknown inteUigences
;he astonishing intellectual phenomena of our OAvn sub-con-
iciousness.
Hence he is not surprised at the hostile reception and
ncreduhty which the facts encounter at present. But he
idduces instances of other phenomena, now well known and
iommonplace, which half a century ago Avould have been
•egarded as wildly incredible. For instance, these four, which
n 1875 "could not possibly have been foreseen :
1. A voice spealdng in Paris is heard in Rome.
2. The germs of disease can be bottled and cultivated
in a cupboard.
3. The bones of a living person can be photographed.
4. Guns can be taken through the air at 180 miles
an hour.
Professor Richet is critical in his language. He will permit
is to say that some facts are usual and some unusual ; but
le objects to our making two classes, facts that are under-
:tood and facts that are not understood. For he claims that
ve really understand nothing of the truths of science, whether
^reat or small. We hve among mysteries, which only do not
istonish us because we are used to them.
The facts of metapsychics are neither more nor less
mysterious than the phenomena of electricity, of fertihza-
tion, and of heat. They are not so usual ; that is the
whole difference. But it would be absurd to dechne to
study them because they are unusual.
In estimating the value of this book we must remember
ts object. This object wiH hardly be plain to Enghsh readers
vho occupy themselves with the translation so usefully •
pre-
jared by Mr. Stanley de Brath. For its title. Thirty Years

Treatise on Metapsychics. It suggests rather a summary or
survey of thirty years of personal experience and investiga-

tion. I can imagine someone saying,^
—" Well, after all, tha
is what the book is, except that the author quotes not onl
his own observations but the observations and experimeni
of many others, so far as they have been made accessibl
in one of the Romance languages." If this were the plat
it might be supposed that when experiences are cited the
would be given in full, with all the precautions and details
like a description of some new experiment in a scientifi
Journal ; so as to enable a student to put himself in a judicia
position, and detect, if he can, flaws of observation am
possibilities of error.
But that is not the line taken by a text-book, or by an;
other summary treatise. Nor is it consistent with Professo
Richet's plan. It would be altogether too burdensome an(
bulky to try and cover the ground in that manner. A com
prehensive treatise can only give a general summary of thi
methods and results, with references to the original sources
where the student must look up the details of any particula
point he thinks worthy of close attention, in the Proceeding.
of scientific societies or other contemporary pubhcations. Ful
details are never given in a text-book. And in many text
books no reference to the original source is given. Incidenti
are copied from other writers, or taken on second-hanc
authority from some other expositor.
Hence in judging the information given in the Traite di
Metapsychique, we must not judge it exactly from the S.P.R
point of view. If we do, we shall be able to point out
lacunae, and even a certain amount of casualness in thf
narration, which can only be corrected by supplementary
study of the original record whence the facts summarised in
the text-book are drawn.
It is famihar to students of science that the original record
of any experiment or discovery is usually more interesting
and ilhiminating, when the paper written by the original
discoverer is referred to, than the comparatively brief summary
in -a text-book can possibly be. Such summaries are of
great value to students, who could not otherwise be expected
to cover the ground or to know what to look for. To a
certain extent they may be accepted as representing the
impression made upon the mind of the writer of the text-

book ; and they may in many cases be accepted on his
authority, unless there is some special reason for doubting
them. For the purpose of passing examinations, and getting
a ground-work of knowledge, the text-book alone may be
sufficient. But for anything hke serious study, by a senior
student, of some special phenomenon which attracts his atten-
tion, references to the original sources are indispensable.
Otherwise a number of illuminating details may be missed,
and facts may either be accepted too readily, or, on the
other hand, rejected too readily; whereas a fuller study of
the whole circumstances would supply many missing details,
and contribute to a fuller and better understanding.
Especially is this necessary when dealing with facts to
which we have not a theoretical clue, and which in their
own nature seem more or less incredible. In all such cases
no amount of reading would or ought to justify a feeUng
of complete confidence ;
nothing can replace first-hand experi-
ence. One object of a text-book is to encourage the student
to make experiments for himself, to open his mind to the
possibihties of discovery, and to value the critical care and
iS precautions which have been and must be taken to avoid
deception.
Professor Richet maintains that he is careful to confine
himself to a summary and description of the facts of observa-
tion and to leave theories to the future. He objects to
mixing up hypotheses concerning the real nature of the pheno-
mena at the present stage. The facts as conceived by many
people seem to have a distinct bearing on human destiny ;
and an attempt has been made to build a great theoretical
structure upon them.
But all this is entirely foreign to Professor Richet's object.
1, He says in his Preface that he has "endeavoured to write
in on science, not on dreams." He has therefore confined himself,
nil or tried to confine himself, to a statement of facts and a
J discussion of their actuaUty, scarcely mentioning theories;
1 for all theories as yet proposed to account for metapsychic
[i' facts appear to him terribly frail. No doubt some day a
tenable theory will be formulated ; but the time is not yet,
;i for the facts themselves are in dispute. Scientific men have
s hitherto often rejected them mthout examination. Neverthe-
'^'^
Sir Oliver Lodge. [pari
less in his view the facts are numerous, authentic, and startUng ;
and he does not see how any unbiassed man of science could
dare to cast doubt upon them all if he consents to look into
them.
The three fundamental phenomena of the new science he
sums up under three heads :
1. Cryptesthesia (which covers Clairvoyance and Telepathy
and Premonitions).
2. Teleldnesis (or movements of inert matter without
apparent contact or known forces).
3. Ectoplasm (or what are commonly called material-
isation phenomena : appearances of clothes, veils and
living bodies).
These, he says, make up the whole of Metapsychics. "To
admit them is to admit a great deal. To go further is to
go beyond the present bounds of Science." He claims however
that these three strange phenomena will have to be admitted,
whatever may be the explanation at which we ultimately
arrive ;
" although Science, severe and inexorable Science,
has hitherto refused to contemplate them."
It has long been recognised that the main branches of the
whole subject are two, the more purely psychical variety
and the more especially physical variety. The two are prob-
ably connected, but the connection is not always manifest.
Professor Richet divides his book accordingly, and calls
the two branches
:
1. Subjective Metapsycities, including Lucidity of various
Idnds, Monitions, and Previsions ; and
2. Objective Metajjsijchics, including physical movements
exceptionally caused, Levitations, and MateriaUsations.
The subjective portion occupies some 500 pages ; the ob-
jective portion, in which he has admitted Hauntings, occupies
about 300 ;
while the concluding chapter of the book is a
general discussion of the phenomena, with prejudice shown
in favour of normal and material interpretation in terms of
human faculty, and with hostile criticism of the other rather
facile hypotheses which have been made by different workers.
The treatment, or imphed doctrine throughout, is quite
appropriate to the attitude of mind natural to an eminent
LXXXIX.] A Text-Booh of Metapsychics. 75
Physiologist, accustomed to deal with bodily mechanisms,
and not ready to admit any kind of supernormal causes
beyond unexpected and puzzhng extensions of human powers.
The facts of clairvoyance and of Lucidity generally, or
what he recognises as the unexplained human faculties which
he sums up as Cryptesthesia, prove, he claims, that in human
subconsciousness there are unexpected reserves of intelHgence
and far-reaching perceptions, not exphcable by the recognised
organs of sense and transcending the recognised boundaries
of both space and time. The facts of Telekinesis and
Materiahsation tend to show that the human organism can
exert force beyond its recognised periphery, and that temporary
emanations' from that organism can not only exert force on
distant objects, but can also mould themselves into strange
simulacra, which for a time can be seen, felt, and photo-
I
graphed, and Avhich imitate, in an extraordinary manner,
portions of the normal body whence they arose. These ecto-
plasmic formations are the most incredible of aU, and must
have seemed bizarre and almost repellent to any Biologist.
Nevertheless Professor Eichet, in spite of his recognition of
their amazing and outrageous character, finds himself able
to vouch for them as unexplained and apparently inexphcabie
reahties.
AU ideas about the Soul and Survival are foreign to his
conceptions. He remains a Materiahst, satisfied with expressing
the facts in terms of their material substratum, and able to
dispense with any speculation as to their psychic and spiritual
nature. Everything is attributed to unconscious and hitherto
unrecognised latent powers in the human organism. If
information is obtained about things occurring at a chstance,
—
the fact is attributed to the lucidity or Cryptesthesia of the
unconscious part of the medium, not to the conveyance of
:| information by some other inteUigence. And when com-
m munications are received, apparently from some deceased
1
I
person, about things which he alone might be supposed to
know,—that also is attributed to the same kind of cryptes-
: thesia, called forth and directed by means unknown to us,
so as to operate unconsciously on the bodily mechanism.
!
And in such cases the impression produced, on the medium
and on those present, is liable to take the form of a dramatic

semblance or impersonation, so striking as to lead them to|
imagine that the deceased person is in reality exercising some!
influence ;
it appears that he is acting as if he still retained! flich
consciousness and memory, and as if he utiHsed the medium's
mechanism, and worked it as he used to work his own, so
as by its aid to be enabled to communicate.
Whereas, on Professor Richet's view, or at least on what
he considers for the present to be the only scientific view,
such deceased persons, having lost their brain and bodily
mechanism, have ceased to be, and are obviously incapable
of doing anything whatever, let alone still possessing the
power of giving any information or showing signs of intelli-
gence, even though the intelligence shown is such as otherwise
might naturally be attributed to them. To suppose that
deceased people are able to communicate, or even that they
are still in any state of existence, is to him a hypothesis, a
speculation, at present not scientifically justified. We must
be satisfied to record the facts, and leave the interpretation
to the future. Though it must be admitted that a strong
prejudice against the usually adopted explanation may lead
a critic, even one who tries to be scrupulously fair, into
discounting and occasionally misrepresenting some of the
facts which he is trying to record. He may, for instance,
be tempted to bring an accusation of triviaUty and improba-
bility to bear on cases which, to a less prejudiced mind,
would emancipate themselves readily from any such accusation
So far I have attempted to give some indication of the
nature and scope of the book, which undoubtedly is a very
important pubhcation, and is bound to have a considerable
influence on the future development of the subject. It may
now be well to add a few points of genial criticism.
And first on certain small matters of nomenclature. Pro
fessor Richet's object in his nomenclature is to avoid anything
in the nature of hypothesis. But the term " Cryptesthesia,"
which he prefers to Lucidity or Clairvoyance and Telepathy,
does seem unintentionaUy to convey the hypothesis that the
information obtained is got by an extension of the powers,
or by an enhanced sensibiHty of the organs of sense ;
being
allied to the words Telesthesia and Hyperesthesia, which are
4
jXXXIX.] A Text-Booh of Metapsychics. 77
ntended to convey that implication. Something of that
lort may be true, but it is unwise to assume it. A term
yhich seems to assume it may become a troublesome trap.
^Nevertheless an assumption of that kind does seem acceptable
;o Professor Richet, for says he :
"... I prefer to imagine an amazing retinal vision of
written words (he means in a sealed box or at a great
distance) than a reading of my brain wherein nothing
is written, but in which there are so many impressions,
memories, and exceedingly complex and evanescent com-
binations that are really ultra-microscopic modifications of
cellular protoplasm, and have no relation, apart from
my own consciousness, to the sound or to the phonetic
sign of a name. To say "telepathy" explains nothing.
Cerebral vibration, conscious or unconscious, is a profound
mystery, much more mysterious than a signature, which
is a positive, real, and tangible thing, and would be
visible to sight if sufficiently penetrating ; whereas the
reading of a thought cannot be explained by any intensi-
fication of any of our senses."
French Edition (p. 76).
Enghsh Edition (p. 66).
After some illustrations he goes on :
" Some go even further. As there are facts known
to no living person, but known to B., now dead, this
can still be explained by telepathy—it is still by telepathy
that the thought of B., deceased, has been transmitted
to the percipient.
These wire-drawn explanations amply show that we
know absolutely nothing of the means whereby cryptes-
thetic cognitions reach the mind . . .
I think it best to keep within the Umits of rigid science,
and to say—At certain times the mind can take cogniz-
ance of reahties which neither our senses, our insight, nor
1
our reasoning, permit of our knowing. This is not an
explanation, but it leaves the door open to any future
explanation. Human thought is one among the reahties
thus made known, but this is not a necessary condition
;
I
'^^ Sir Oliver Lodge. [pabi
the reahty alone is sufficient, without its having passed
through a human mind.
Let us go no further, and in presence of these unusual
facts let us be content to say that our mental mechanism,
even more complex than it seems, has means of cog-
nizance that escape analysis and are even beyond surmise.
This dispenses with all hypothesis ;
i
it does not imply
that cryptesthetic knowledge arises from transmitted
vibrations of human thought; it merely states a fact,
and it is more scientific to enunciate a fact without
comment than to enmesh one's self in theories, such as
telepathy, which are entirely unproven.
" Telepathy " imphes a hypothesis :
" cryptesthesia "
has the great merit that it does not. If A. sees his
dying friend B. at the moment of death it is a hypothesis
to say that the thought of B. has been transmitted to A.
But it is no hypothesis to say that A. has some special
sensibihty that makes him aware of the death of B. . . .
Therefore, when in this book telepathy is spoken of,
as it often A^ill be, it must be understood as a particular
form of lucidity, and not as a distinct phenomenon. ,
Both are equally mysterious."
The last thing I want to do in a review is to argue the
matter with the author. My object is rather to present his
case. But when it comes to theorising or speculating—which
is inevitable however much one tries to refrain from it,—the
idea of attributing a sort of omniscience to the unconscious
self of the medium strikes me as so far fetched and intrinsi-
cally absurd that I may be allowed to indicate briefly the
argument- on the other side, which I will do by paraphrasing
some words of Mr. J. Arthur Hill, since they summarise the
position in a clear and crisp manner. He writes to me in
a letter something like this :
To yield preference to the hypothesis that Mrs. Piper's
subliminal somehow has access to the memories of, say, G. P.,
rather than to the hypothesis of the continued existence
1 I interrupt here to say that the word " mechanism " in this con-
nexion is full of hyi^othesis; and so is the word "sensibility'" further
down.
161
Lxxxix.] A Text-Book of MetapsycMcs. 79
of G. P., appears illogical. The assumption of quasi-omni-
science, or access to a cosmic reservoir of information and
personal memories, is a step further from fact than is the
idea of personal survival. We know at least that G. P. did
exist, so there is nothing absurd in the supposition that he
may still exist, if the facts point that way ; whereas nothing
has ever suggested the possession by a human being of anj^
kind of omniscience. Moreover, even if the idea of indefinite
extension of cryptesthesia or latent sensibility could be ration-
ally entertained, there would still be the searching question
to answer ;
—" From among the mass of material thus open,
who selects the appropriate details " ?
I (0. J. L.) put this question to Richet briefly and forcibly,
" Who selects ?
" Qids deligit ?
It is permissible to add that the fact of telepathy or trans-
mission of ideas between living persons, without perceptible
use of the organs of sense, makes it easier to accept the
possibility of telepathic communion with a discarnate mind.
The term " discarnate mind," or mind dissociated from matter,
no doubt to Richet sounds absurd. But probably a Physicist
is more accustomed to non-sensible and immaterial conditions
than is a Physiologist. A Physiologist is bound to search
for mechanical and molecular processes in the complex organ-
isms he studies ; and very admirable and successful has been
his search. But a Physicist has had to learn, among other
things, that in the ether of space there are no molecules, no
Chemistry, and perhaps no ordinary Mechanics. He is not
unaccustomed to encounter a thing sui generis, with properties
of its own, distinct from the properties of the atomic and
molecular aggregates with which our animal-derived sense
organs have made us obtrusively familiar. Professor Richet
would probably agree that to state a fact in terms of matter
is after all no full and ultimate and final elucidation. Mystery
remains even when such a statement can be made. So why
lay undue and exclusive stress on what is after aU an inter-
mediate stage of exposition ?
Richet is quite within his rights in feeUng any form of
spiritistic hypothesis highly improbable. But he must not
Sir Oliver Lodge. [paei
suppose that either in his mind or in his book he is refraining
from theorising. Witness such passages as these :
It
Everything seems to prove that the intelligence is a ««
function of the brain, that it depends on the integrity lil
of the cerebral mechanism, and on the volume and quality
of the blood that irrigates it.
It is possible, it is even probable, that there may
exist in nature other intelligences under other conditions
than the physical conditions of terrestrial life ; but they
would no longer be human intelligences . . . They
would not belong to humanity; since the mind, whether
human or animal, can possess the human psychological
characteristics of consciousness, memory, sensibility, reason,
and will, only if the brain exists. Thousands and thou-
sands of experiments establish so close a relation between
the brain as organ and intelligence as function, that it
is as impossible to admit the persistence of the function
(mind) without the organ (brain) as the renal secretion
without the kidney.

This being his view—or at all events his present view,—it
is not surprising that he finds a difficulty about telepathy.
If telepathy means direct reading and interpreting the mole-
cular configuration in another person's brain, by whatever
penetrating insight such molecules can be perceived—such
reading is I admit frankly incredible. No wonder he prefers
to take refuge in a vague agnosticism rather than admit the
likelihood of any such forced and elaborate and gratuitous
hypothesis. But his readers are probably aware that other
serious students have held other notions, and that his alterna-
tive is not the only one. Some approximation to one of
the normal methods of conveying human thought is altogether
more likely. The point largely turns upon the question
whether mind ever acts on mind directly without the customary
modes of bodily and sensory signalling, and without the
unhkely and unsupported hypothesis of brain acting on brain.

ated, but its basis is very insecure when appUed to the
lat nterpretation of molecular configurations ;
which, after all, are
M naccessible.
iej The fact is, that in spite of Professor Richet's instinct
ley lot to theorise but merely to state facts, he cannot help
18 iheorising at times ; and in my view no one can. !Facts
;al strung on no thread of hypothesis are random and intractable
)i things. Some hypothesis at the back of one's mind is necessary :
ID- jo abstain from it is impossible, however lightly and tenta-
eii "ively it be held. But Richet is naturally so impressed,
il through a life-long occupation with Physiology, with the
% material and cerebral aspect of orthodox psychic phenomena
jj n general, that he does not feel as if he were theorising in
:;he least when he assumes that throughout every mental action,
I), in origin, in transmission, and in reproduction, there must
1, 36 a physical concomitant at every stage. Take Telepathy
["or instance :
—admittedly there is a physical concomitant
;j
Dn the part of the percipient, whose muscles must be put
:nto action somehow, presumably through his brain-nerve
mechanism as usual, in order to display any result ; but
^
it is a pure assumption to suppose that that brain is stimu-
, lated mechanically or physicaUy by some other organism.
Or, to put it more concretely, brain processes are presumably
. of a chemical order, and it is a hypothesis to assume that
bhere is anything in the nature of vibration between one
^
brain and another when telepathy or any other transmission
3f thought occurs between two people. Whatever may turn
3ut to be the truth about such a matter, to state with our
present dearth of knowledge that there must be such a vibra-
tion is merely dogma. So that when Richet says that a
telepathic impression must be due to some unknown vibration,
lie is theorising.
He seems rather enamoured of the word " vibrations "
;
spelled the same in French as in English, and I suppose

meaning the same. Of Hallucination, for instance, he sayi j,,,:
on page 708,
^
... in order to produce a veridical hallucination there
must be some kind of exterior cause or molecular vibra
tion that starts the cryptesthetic emotion ;
though he admits that these " vibrations " do not resemblt
ordinary mechanical molecular vibrations.
He further says that in the case of collective hallucinations
when several persons simultaneously see the same apparition,
it is impossible to deny the objectivity. One can hardly
suiopose, he says, that these images which many people see,
have no objectivity,—are not mechanically objective. But
other views have been held and discussed by Myers and
Gurney.
So that the only theorising he really seems to object to.
strongly is the variety v/hich is connected with spiritistic
hyiDotheses. It may not have occurred to him that any
theory is implied in ordinary materialistic views; to him
they seem axiomatic. But confidently to assume their neces-iy
sary truth and completeness is to close the door to a possible
aspect of the subject which many students have been driven
to, in spite of their initial materialistic predilections.
I see that Professor Richet not only objects to the term
" supernatural,"—which many people do,—but also objects
to the term " supernormal," which Myers devised in order
to take its place. He says that both terms are inadmissible,
that there can be nothing in the universe but the natural
and the normal. " From the moment that a fact exists, it
is necessarily both natural and normal." I do not know
whether the French word normal conveys a significance
different from ours, but certainly the phenomena of Meta-
psychics are not normal in our sense of the word. They
may be real, they may be natural ;
they may even some
day seem connnonplace ; but certainly, in the present state
of human knowledge, they are not customary, or universally
admitted, or normal. They do not come up, either, to
any recognised standard or norm. They lie outside our regular
experience. They are astonishing, extraordinary, supernormal.
This is evidently a limitation depending on the present

standard of human attainment. But then, what else is language ?
,
Professor Richet's objection to the term, however, is interest-
ng, because it emphasises his object, which is to bring these
ahenomena out of the region of the occult and the mysterious,
nto the region of the normal through unusual faculties of
nanliind. " Unusual " he will -perforce allow : but " suj)er-
lormal " he will not. And that is a brief summary of his
theoretical position throughout the work. His hope and
endeavour are to trace and attribute everything to the normal
acuities of man, without bringing in outside and hypothetical
nfluences of any kind whatsoever. Not that he is foolishly
iogmatic enough to deny the possibility of such influences,
jut because he considers that they are beyond the scope of
jresent science ; and his object is to be purely scientific.
Whether he will succeed in influencing his biological colleagues
'avourably, by this cautious attitude, is doubtful ; but at
my rate it seems to give him some advantages, and inspires
lim with an easy boldness in narrating the queerest facts.
3e can feel sure that his sanity will not be called in question,
^d, after all, what the theoretical view of anj^ one person
nay be at any given time—even a Professor Richet,—is
iomparatively unimportant. Judicial recognition and accept-
mce of genuine facts is the vital thing for the future well-
3eing of science. For if, after all the effort of the past and
present generation, the subject still lies outside the bounds
)f recognition,—if it still continues to be the subject only
)f ridicule and contempt,—^that wholesale rejection will to
uture generations seem rather a sad and lamentable repetition
)f mistakes which have too frequently and consistently been
nade by the high priests of orthodoxy in the past,
"^ow, however, we learn that Professor Richet has had the
jourage to present his volume to the French Academy of
iciences, and that on the strength of his reputation the book
vas accepted even with some acclamation. Criticism of course
s far from silenced ; no one would wish it to be silenced ;
5ut the dawn of. a more enlightened day seems approaching.
Ckiticisms of Detail.
So far for a general and appreciative survey of the book,
it is rather a thankless task to descend to details and especi-
I

ally into minutiae of criticism. But from the S.P.R. point
of view it is necessary to say something in that direction.
Otherwise a wrong impression may be conveyed as to the
precision and care taken in the selection and treatment of
the selected examples.
It appears certain and very natural that Professor Richet
has paid more attention to the physical and physiological
side of things than to the more purely psychic phenomena,
notwithstanding the abundant space which these latter occupy
in his book. He is not as familiar with the evidence collected
by the S.P.R. as he doubtless is with the details of many
other enquiries. And unintentionally he occasionally mis-
represents it. It seems desirable therefore in the interests
of truth that a few of these misrepresentations, or occasional
errors of detail, should be pointed out, so as to put students
on their guard and make them realise how necessary it is
to refer to the original authorities. Unfortunately the reaUy
original authorities—at least in English cases—are rarely cited
or apparently referred to by Richet, who seems content with
accepting his foreign matter in quotations by others, or to
depend often on abbreviated translations. He therefore does
not always do full justice to the exact record, sometimes
tending to appreciate it somewhat, sometimes unduly to
depreciate it ; and apparently insignificant details, like proper
names and places, are treated rather casually. He probably
considers that he has an instinct for the essential, and can
afford to slur over the rest. The S.P.R. is more laborious
and cautious, for it is conscious that it does not precisely
know which points are essential. And its leaders cultivate
a habit of scrupulosity about detail which may be wearisome
but is a defect on the safe side.
The important branch of the subject called by the S.P.R.
" Cross-correspondence " seems to have been totally mis-
conceived by Richet. Most of the instances which he gives
are mere instances of telepathy, not of cross -correspondence
at all. This absence of understanding about the meaning of
what has been termed cross-correspondence is a defect which
I feel sure he will wish to remedy. At present the heading
affixed to that section of the book is misleading. Other
important people abroad have failed to recognise the special

features of real cross-correspondence, and the singularly striking
3haracter of the evidence for survival which they embody
;
though admittedly they embody it in a way which needs
some laborious delving, for it does not lie on the surface.
Concerning hallucinations, Richet seems to think there is
something pathological or morbid about them ;
saying that,
with, a few insignificant exceptions, '"no normal sane individual,
EuUy awake, has any hallucinations. If he sees apparitions
it is because the apparitions have an objective reality." But
this is contrary to the evidence collected by Gurney in Phan-
tasms of the Living, and also to that collected in the " Census
of Hallucinations." (See Proceedings, Vol. X.) So that this
must be regarded rather as a dogmatic assertion than as a
carefully considered estimate, if the word " hallucination
"
is used in the S.P.R. sense. But, as I point out later, Richet's
terminology is rather different, and his use of the word hal-
lucination, as an impression not caused by anything outside
the patient, does require a pathological cause. I emphasise
the different signification of the term here, because otherwise
readers of the book who are familiar with the Proceedings
'S.P.R. may be misled.
In the rapid summarising of recorded evidence there is
always liable to be some slight error, sometimes unimportant,
sometimes important. And it may be helpful if I record a
few which have been noticed. First, certain questionable
assertions about exact time.
Page 379.
Mrs. Green's dream of drowning girls. Judging by the dates
given, the dream as recorded occurred twelve hours after the
death, not "a cette meme heure." This error is quite ex-
cusable, however, for when the case was first printed in the
Journal S.P.R. the percipient had attributed the wrong sign
to the difference of longitude. The correction was made later
in Phantasms (Vol. I., page 376, footnote), and in an
article by Myers in the Proceedings. This case is a good one,
and is often quoted by Richet. He will recognise that it
is important to make no error about coincidence of time,
because that may clearly affect a subsequent explanation.
Page 305.
There seems no evidence in the record that the death of

Mrs. Bagot's dog occurred on the same day as the vision

pient loiew of the dog's death.

twenty minutes, and was not accurately at the samt
moment."
Pages 384 (the Jukes case), and 394 (the Runciman Haggil
case).
The discrepancy in time was a few hours.
Page 406. (The Williams case.)
The death appears to have occurred about two days later
than the dream.
The compilers of Phantasms of the Living paid particular
attention to time ; not only for evidential reasons, but because,
working on the h3rpothesis of telepathy, an impression received
before a death could be attributed to the unconscious agency
of the still living person ; whereas, an impression received
some time after the death of the presumed " agent " would
have to be attributed either to telepathy from the dead or
to deferred telepathy from the living. If telepathy is thrown
overboard, and a general crypt esthesia substituted, details
about time probably seem less important.
Myers went so far as to suggest the plotting of a sort of
probability curve representing the time interval (before or
after) between death and apparition. The sort of curve he
means, and indicates on page 427 of Vol. V., Proc. S.P.R.,
could easily be assimilated by a physicist to Maxwell's law
of the distribution of velocities among the molecules of a
gas. The curve of Maxwell is shaped like this :
and its equation is

The point A would correspond with the instant of crisis
or death. Times before and after, at which monitions or
apparitions occur, are plotted horizontally ;
number of instances
are plotted vertically, each at its right relative time.
If any young investigator is stimulated to use the records
already made, for analysing their time relations,—though at
present the number of records are insufficient, in spite of the
laborious " census of haUucinations " conducted by Prof, and
Mi-s. Sidgwick,—I would caution him or her to be very careful
in estimating each detailed time. Time and longitude are
rather confusing, without practice, and a hasty extraction of
dates and hours may be misleading. Moreover, clocks are
liable to be wrong enough to matter sometimes, even if they
are carefully read.
Then, passing to examples of another kind :
Page 232.
Professor Gilbert Murray's important experiments are attri-
buted by Richet to auditive hyperesthesia. This hypothesis
was considered, and apparently half-favoured, by Professor
Murray himself—in default of any even semi-normal explana-
tion ; but it was carefully examined by Mrs. Verrall {Pro-
ceedings, Vol. XXIX., p. 83), and is really not a reasonable
supposition, under all the circumstances.

About the well-lmown case of Abraham Florentme. Pvichet
says no American or English journal had mentioned his death.
That is not so. Accounts had been printed in America ;
and the main question is whether these papers can have
fallen under the eye of Stainton Moses. (See Journal S.P.R.,

the second it was which gave his face in miniature. Pro-
bably Richet here, as in other cases, may have been misled
by the secondary authority to which he refers, a quotation
or reference to it in some other work, instead of going back
to the original authority, and enabling his readers to do
the same.
88 Sir Oliver Lodge. [paeI
Richet appears to be under an important misapprehension
about the experiments with G. A. Smith by Gurney and
Myers. He thinks that G. A. Smith ultimately denied these
experiments (page 104). But that is not so. By the way,
the reference given to these experiments is wrong ; those
puMished in Volume VIII. of Proceedings were an entirely
different set. The invented denials and supposed surreptitious
methods, published long afterwards by Blackburn (called by
Richet, Blackman) in a newspaper article, are worthy of no
credence. For Blackburn turned out to be a scoundrel.
(See, for a full account of the newspaper correspondence,
S.P.R. Journal, Vol. XV., pp. 115-132.)
The following brief extract will show what G. A. Smith's
attitude was. Blackburn had concocted his article for John
Bull or some other paper, under the impression (which he
admits) that Smith and all who could contradict him were
dead. Says G. A. Smith :
" Let me say at once that Mr. Blackburn's story is a
tissue of errors [this is a mild term] from beginning to
end.
We never contemplated the possibihty of '
coding
'
until we learnt it from Mr. Myers and Mr. Gurney them-
selves. He says we practised it together and brought
off startlmg hits. We never did anything of the kmd.
He did once say what a journalistic sensation might be
made by pretending the phenomena were done by trickery.
He has waited, it appears, until he thought all were dead
who took part in the experiments in order to pretend
this ..."
Discussing possible normal means of effecting the transmission
of a certain sketch to the percipient while swaddled and
swathed in blankets, Smith quotes Mr. Gurney as having
said at the time that under the circumstances the only pos- f
sible way of doing it by trickery was to conceal the drawing bi
in a pencil case and pass it into the supposed percipient's
hands as soon as he asked for a pencil. This and other
still more ingenious suggestions of Mr. Gurney, concerning
possible and conceivable tricks of signalling, were later repro-
duced by Blackburn as having been the means by which
the feats were actually done.

01 Later Mr. G. A. Smith says of Blackburn's statement —
"It is the most amazing piece of mvention ever brought
to my notice ... All the essential points of Mr. Black-
burn's article are untrue, and I deny the whole story
*
from beginning to end."
'Ij
Hi Perhaps this denial of Blackburn's lies is what misled
l)j >rofessor Richet into thinking that Smith denied the validity
111, f the experiments ! On the contrary, he adheres to them
el trongly, and says that he found Myers and Gurney " were
'.n the watch not only for premeditated trickery but for un-
onscioiis trickery as weU." They were "aware of every
levice and dodge for making sham phenomena." And the
ngenuities in Blackburn's amusing series of articles are those
lypothetically devised by Gurney himself as outrageous
ichemes against which to guard.
The experiments conducted in 1881 by Professor Barrett
md others with the Creery children are not to be set aside
iavalierly, as Professor Richet is inclined to do (pp. 67 and 107).
They were upheld as genuine by the extremely cautious
Professor Sidgwick, in his Presidential Address to the S.P.R.
n 1884, when he implies that the results could only be ac-
counted for normally by one or other of the investigators
i [laving been in the trick. The subsequent detection and
admission of signalling between these girls, on later occasions
when one was agent and another percipient, do not really
undermine previous experiments, when the investigators them-
selves were the agents. Sir William Barrett sets special value
on his original experiments with the Creery children, because
he regards them as essentially the scientific discovery, as
opposed to the mere popular suspicion, of the fact of tele-
pathy or telepathic lucidity ;—a fact which, however inter-
ipreted, has since been so amply confirmed. So ample has
'been the confirmation of this kind of lucidity, in other cases,
that Professor Richet is well within his rights if he prefers
to ignore any experiments on which any kind of doubt or
suspicion can be thrown by reason of subsequent mal-practices.
Gurney's statement on the subject is in Proc. S.P.R., V.
pp. 269, 270. Some account of these and other early tele-
pathic experiments are given in Phantasms of the Living,
90 Sir Oliver Lodge. [paB'
pp. 10-31. Barrett's o^oi initial summary can be referr©
to in Nature, Vol. 24, page 212 (July 7th, 1881), that bein
a year before the foundation of the S.P.R.,—in which founda
tion no doubt Barrett's enthusiasm played a stimulating part
There are other little points, sometimes of discrepancy
sometimes of judgement, to which I might call attention
But enough of these small corrections, which by no meam
pretend to be exhaustive. They would to some readers seen
quite trivial, if we went through them all. But wlien engagec
in recording facts without theory, no details can be trifling
When we have not the clue, we have no means of judging
what is trifling and what is not. With a clue we may ration^
ally discard some things as insignificant ; but when searching
for a clue, the most trivial detail—a smear on a windo-w
ledge, the brand of a cigar ash, a fragment of finger-nail,—'
may be more significant than all the rest of the striking and
superficially interesting events. In detective cases a witness
has to be adjured to leave out no detail, however trivial;
and the same urge is surely rightly felt by a conscientious
recorder of psychic occurrences. Everything, not merely
conspicuous things, must be exact. That is why the methods
of the S.P.R. have been so irritating : they might be stig-
matised as even painfully pernickity and pragmatically precise.
As pioneers they were seeking a clue, and required the scent
of a sleuth-hound and the instinct of a Sherlock Holmes.
If that instinct sometimes failed us, and if we have occasion-
aUy attended to details with Dr. Watson's eyes, our good,
intentions and the difficulty of the subject must be some
excuse.
Parenthetically it occurs to me to suggest that the kind
of summary description which Richet gives of each quoted
case might have been employed with advantage as a prelude
to each of the detailed accounts recorded in Phantasms or
Proc. S.P.R. It is tiresome to have to read the full record
in order to find out what sort of case it is and what" it is
all about. A short summary would tell us this, and then
the record would be there for study and minute scrutiny
in sucli cases as seemed worth while.

Richet's Terminology.
It may help a reader to know that what the S.P.R. called
" Phantasms of the Livhig " (or of the Dead for that matter),
and " Monitions," Richet calls sporadic cryiDtesthesia
"
{cryptesthesie accidentelle):' The S.P.R. similarly called it
"Spontaneous Telepathy," a term which is much the same,
though rather more definite, and therefore Avith the chance
of being rather more wrong (or perhaps right).
What is commonly called " Psychometry " (which he stig-
matises as "a detestable term") Richet styles "Pragmatic
cryptesthesia," because it is excited by or in connexion with
some material object ;
though he thinks it doubtful if material
contact with any object is really necessary.
Previsions are " Premonitory cryptesthesia," and may, he
says, be either due to some form of auto-suggestion or un-
conscious self inference, or may be received under hypnotism,
or may simulate spiritistic influences. Such premonitions
may relate to sickness or to death or to accidents or to
sundry events.
It is noteworthy that Richet does not use the word " hal-
lucination " freely, as the leaders of the S.P.R. have done
or used to do ; for he considers that about an hallucination
there is something morbid, and if an apparition or other
deceptive appearance represents or corresponds to some kind
of reality, no matter how remote, that subjective vision or
audition is not strictly an hallucination. He interprets that
term as signifying " a mental image exteriorised without any
exterior reality."
In general we may say that Professor Richet's independent
attitude and freedom from tradition are rather refreshing,
ikj We in this country are apt to follow a lead or general trend,
J especially in writing for the S.P.R., the cautious attitude of
III whose founders we more or less admire and desire to imitate.
Richet is emancipated from this tradition, and, by following
•
a course of his own, sets things under a ncAV aspect.
Richet's Chapter VII. contains a remarkable summary and
discussion of cases of prevision ; for this surprising extension
of human faculty evidently impresses him considerably, and
the more difficult he feels it of any rational explanation, the
1
92 Sir Oliver Lodge. [pAR'i
more closely he attends to and collects the evidence. Ir!
the end he considers it established, though he admits the
difficulty of reconciling such a faculty with other experiences
and human instincts in general. This section is perhaps the
most notable and carefully compiled in the subjective portion
of the book. He knows how extraordinary such a faculty is.
and how strong the evidence necessary to establish it, but
he perceives that the evidence is strong enough. So he has
faith that an explanation will be found in time, and that
this phenomenon, together with all the other facts he deals
with, will presently fit into their niches in an orderly system
of ascertained truth.
In contrast with his acceptation of prevision, may be in
stanced his rather hypercritical attitude to what he calls
" Xenoglossie." The instances he cites of this speaking or
writing in unknown tongues are impressive, especially those
in which a child is the operator; but he disdains to con-
sider anything of the nature of partial possession or " control,"
either in this or in any other connexion ; and he sums up
by saying that :
" none of the facts, whether of Xenoglossie or of automatic
writing by children and unlettered persons, carries sufficient
weight of proof. We cannot therefore grant them full rights
of citizenship in the kmgdom of subjective metapsychics,
though I am inclined to thmk that before long some may
be admitted as authentic."
Child prodigies, musical and other, are dismissed too, as
explicable by abnormally rapid development ; and when
emphasising his own personal knowledge about the marvellous
precocity of Pepito Arriola, who was "a skilful musician at
the age of three years and three months," he says that "no
one has imagined the intervention of a spirit to explain it,"
But it is difficult to contemplate some of these child and
animal prodigies, when weU evidenced, without at least sur-
mising some form of outside intelligent control, I really
cannot contemplate an untrained organism playing the piano
or the violin, or writing Greek or even ecclesiastical Latin,
merely under the influence of its own unconscious or reflex
action.

Physical and Physiological Phenomena.
Concerning the physiological phenomena treated of in the
lecond half of the book, it would be an impertinence for me
;o criticise or even to praise Professor Richet's investigations
md conclusions. In his own subject he is beyond my reach.
BEis medical training gives him many advantages ;
and of
;he abnormal or unusual in this du'ection he has seen much
nore than I have. It was indeed only through his kind
nvitation and hospitality that I was enabled to see what
[ did, in 1894, of the Eusapia phenomena, under admirable
;onditions on his Mediterranean island (see Journal S.P.R.,
Vol. VI., pp. 306-360). We never got the conditions so good
igain ; and phenomena fluctuated, till in England they almost
petered out. Some were genuine even then—notably the
swelling of a curtain—but Professor Richet may be assured
that Eusapia did get a hand loose, by surreptitious and
apparently rather practised means. I pass no condemnation
on her, for various reasons, but such is the fact.
I am able however to vouch for genuine and unmistakable
phenomena on the island, as strongly as Professor Richet
himself. Some of them were totally and even absurdly in-
explicable by any amount of hand or foot loosing, even if
such loosing had been allowed ; which it is safest to assume
may have been done sometimes, however unUkely it may
seem. '
I have no fault to find with Richet's very brief summary
of a few of our experiments on the He Riband with Eusapia.
Phenomena were obtained which were undoubtedly genuine,
and which overcame all suspicion. But his idea of what
went on at Cambridge is vague, and he may think that
there was no fraud. But there was. Hodgson pretended
imbeciUty, and Eusapia fell into the trap. She adopted a
stupid though rather skilful trick. The results so obtained
were feeble, not at all of the old order, and I found it
difficult to suppose that she was trying to fool Hodgson.
Fortunately, before the end, she tried to fool me also ;
and
I testify that undoubtedly she contrived, by a substitution
trick, to get a hand loose when I and Professor Sidgwick
were controlling. Myers was disgusted with her, and the end
94 Sn Oliver Lodge. [pargIsS
was rather painful. But later on, at Richet's invitation
Myers was prevailed on to see her again in more congenia;
surroundings, and his confidence in her possession of rea]
powers—however much when under difficulties she might
try to eke them out—was restored. j
i i
To throw away good experiments because of some bad
ones is an unwise procedure : and few discoveries could be
made if that policy were adopted in a laboratory. Laymen
think that Nature never deceives ; but she does. Caution
and repetition, and renewed caution, and varying conditions,
and repetition with greater Itnowledge of weak points,—those
are the remedies for untoward incidents.
ffC
6 «
Materialisation. p
As to the general question of so-called physical phenomena
and the difficulty of reconciling them with ordinary scientific
knowledge, it is a notable circumstance that Richet finds
himself impelled to admit "materialisation," or ectoplasmic
formations of an anatomical and physiological kind, as a fact.
The evidence must have been very strong to convince him
of so improbable a phenomenon. I myself have both seen
and felt ectoplasmic protuberances ; though sometimes they
could be felt Avhen they could not be seen, and the vision
of them Avas always more indistinct than seemed consistent
with their palpable activity. I doubt if the visible thing is
the enei-getic and forcible portion. The suggestion to my
mind is that the filmy visible thing is more like a sustainer,
connector, or conveyor, of the more active and important
agency ;
on the analogy of a placenta or an investing mem-
brane ;
and that its function is to maintain organic connexion
with the strong substantial mechanism which itself cannot
be seen. Invisible agencies able to exert or transmit force,
even enormous force, are common in physics, e.g. magnetism,'
gravitation, cohesion, and they all depend on the Ether—
for which we have no sense-organ.

'nd not every sentence in it is consistent. It is a fine piece
4 i work, and the occasional variation in mood is instructive.
If ?he variation is part of the facts, and should not be con-
et ealed. To tinker with the sentiments, so as to make them
11 .bsolutely consistent throughout, would not be fair, and has
li,
lot been done. The author lets us into his doubts as well as
it
is certainties, he allows himself to hint at profound mysteries
nfolding before our gaze, and he claims no finality for his
iresent speculative conclusion. What he claims finality for
,re the facts—the great mass of facts—allowing here and
here the evidence for some of them to be weaker than for
ithers, ready to discard any which show signs of weakness,
.nd discarding a few which are really not weak at all, be-
ause of the least suspicion of a flaw.
If anything, either in fact or theory, teUs against the spirit-
5tic explanation, it is emphasised to the full ; and the student
nth a balanced mind will be well advised to accept the
eiterated accusation of triviahty and folly and improbability
t^ith a certain amount of hesitation, just as he is likely to
.ccept the facts with a certain amount of hesitation. My
;dvice to a student is :
See what Richet says ;
keep an open mind, and, when
here is an opportunity, try experiments or make observations
or yourself. Be not deceived by glib spiritualism or by
qually glib materialism. The truth may lie in middle ways.
!ome facts strongly suggest and support the spirit hypothesis.
)thers hardly suggest it, and do not support it at all. Others
,gain are difficult of adjustment and may be held to tell
,gainst it. The existence and display of the power of extensive
acidity and clairvoyance, exercised apparently apart from
,ny mind but an unconscious one, is a real and not a fanciful
ibjection. Reconcihation of opposing views wiU come in time,
mt still further study of the phenomena is necessary. The
lart played by the medium may be exaggerated, but it may
,lso be unduly minimised.
Towards the end of the book Richet begins to abandon

the strictiiess of his claim to be stating facts only, and says-: trie:
I quote from Mr. Stanley de Brath's excellent translation :
P. 619. " To state facts is not enough ; we mus
summon up courage to outline some kind of theory;
imperfect though it will necessarily be . . . To transforr
matter, to become a living ephemeral being, and ti
create ephemeral living matter is to open a new world dei
We are evolving in another dimension, and Man n(
longer belongs to the animal kingdom. He even tran
scends the mechanical world in which Ave move, when
chemistry, physics, and mathematics reign supreme. Any
thing is possible."
And then, before long, he continues—surprisingly :
P. 621. " Why should there not be intelligent anc *
puissant beings distinct from those i^erceptible by oui
senses ? By what right should we dare to affirm, or
the basis of our limited senses, our defective intellect
and our scientific past as yet hardly three centuries old
that in the vast Cosmos man is the sole intelligent being
and that mental reality ahvays depends upon nerve^
cells irrigated with oxygenated blood ?
"
P. 622. " It is said : ' Man only shows his mind by
his brain ; therefore there can be no mind without ap
brain.' Such is the amazing logic of those who accuse
us of working against Science.'
I am ready to go no further myself! And his view of
the Universe is similarly expanding; for, after referring to
the outlook of Science fifty years ago, when the range of
enquiry seemed limited and exhaustible, he heartily welcomes "
the new knowledge in \s'ords such as these :
P. 625. " Our hopes are now vastly greater ; we have
a glimpse of a whole unexplored world full of mysteries,
before which we stand as dumb and dense as a Hottentot
might before Poincare's vortices, Hertz's waves, Pasteur's
microbes, or Einstein's relativity." i'

tries to cover the ground in an orderly, comprehensive and
stematic manner. Text-books can be dry and uninteresting,
it nothing written by Professor Richet is likely to suffer
Dm faults of that kind. His literary style has often been
aised by competent masters ; and as a matter of fact the
)ok is lively and interesting reading. And it gives a com-
ehensive summary of the whole subject in what is intended
be a simple and straightforward manner. It does not of
.urse compare with Myers's great and original Treatise on
uman Personality. It does not aim in that direction,
yers's aim was strongly theoretical ; and the numerous facts
hich he adduced, and which he gave in Appendices in fairly
11 details, were purposely selected as illustrative of his theories,
ichet, we will say, has no theories. Or rather, his theories
e of what may be called the orthodox kind. He adheres
biological orthodoxy so far as he can : and in so far as
s facts do not fit into the scheme,—that is not his fault,
e really tries to fit them in, and would never wish to ex-
ude a fact on theoretical grounds. Whatever weaknesses
ay be pointed out here and there, he has dbne yeoman
Tvice by his labours, and has furnished the world with
robably the most comprehensive survey of the subject that
IS yet been produced.

SEQUEL TO THE REVIEW OF PROFESSOR RICHET'S
" TRAITS DE MfiTAPSYCHIQUE."
Having now reviewed the book, I feel inclined to trespass
Q the space allowed me and carry on a half-playful argument
dth my good friend and eminent co-worker as to the points
n which we differ. The points on which we agree are too
umerous for mention. It seems curious that, on a common
asis of facts, two men of science, both fully accepting all
he discoveries in orthodox science, and acquainted with most
f the phenomena in metapsychics, should differ in their con-
3quent outlook on the universe, rather markedly ;
though
ach is willing to abandon his theoretical position on good
round shown.
We may take the " Conclusion " of this book as Richet's
itest, though by no means his last, word on the subject.

Taking then a few of his points I quote from the Engli^
edition,
—
P. 608. " Will the self of a person who stammere
continue to stammer in the Beyond ? What puerility !
"
Why should this be called puerility ? What do we kno^'
one way or the other ? Let us be guided by the facti
If facts seem puerile or childish,—well, some facts are pueri]
and childish, viz. those belonging to boys and children. Unt
the possibihty of survival is definitely disproved, it does nc
seem altogether unhkely that personal peculiarities and habitus
tricks of expression might be re-assumed and reproduced, if th
old terrestrial existence was either dreamily or otherwis
occasionally remembered and dramatised.
It is mere hypothesis again to say that deceased peopl
would never talk about trifles. How do we know ? Wh-
should they differ so completely from the same people whei
living on this planet ? Our ideas about death have growi
so solemn and religious that it is easy to raise prejudici
against their mentioning or thinking of such a trifle as i
ring or a tie-pin, even if it had special or affectionate associa.
tions. When Professor Kichet says,
—
P. 611 "That one should come back to earth t(
speak of a sleeve-link is not merely feeble, it has nc
likelihood at all ; it is a strong argument against tht
spiritist doctrine."
And, again, when he says,— '

P. 613. "A specific set of prose and verse imitationsf
or personations of certain authors is clever literary work
'
but does not come from a Beyond ... It is in no way '
beyond human powers. It is not the semi-divine inspira-'l'
tion that we might expect from spirits." k
It sounds most sensible.
But is it ? How do we know that " spirits " are in any
sense " semi-divine " ? How do we know that if able to
return they might not bethink themselves of some trifling
episode ?
A might hold that they would never think of trivahties ; B
might hold that they would think of nothing else. Why not cease

to make guesses and ascertain the fact ? It is no use trying to
decry facts by adjectives. The sole question is, are they facts 1
If they are, then it is possible that we may be instructed
by them, and that our adjectives are less than just. In
England the j)rejudice against the employment of trivial
recollections for evidential purposes has been countered again
and again, but probablj^ on the Continent there is leeway
to be made up.
It may seem as if I am attending too exclusively to the
subjective side of psychic phenomena and their interpretation,
which after all are not Richet's main concerns, but he wiU
know that we in England have studied the subjective side
of metapsychics almost exclusively, and only by long considera-
tion have been brought to this pass of yielding to the con-
viction that survival and intercommunion are proved realities,
in spite of numerous difficulties in fully comprehending them.
He wiU not claim that a worker in science can do without
theories for ever, or that human beings are irrefragably bound
to materiaUstie theories. We mi^st be guided by the facts.
The importance of Richet's book, which is undoubtedly
based on a long study of the subject, justifies a thorough
and critical examination of his position, and he wiU be the
last to resent arguments and contentions about the various
phenomena regarded from a point of view differing from his
own. He must reahse that we have not taken up our position
Lightly and without fair recognition of its difficulties ; but
until a better theory can be promulgated,—and the absence
of all theory is not a better one, however allowable as a
-emporary and cautions expedient,—we must follow our clue
antil it ceases to guide. The time for caution must some
time expire ; and if we have had to get down off the fence,
16 will grant that it may be with good reason, oven if he
ioes not appreciate or accept that reason. If he considers
ihat our reasoning is not good enough, I cordially recognise
lis right to an opinion.

and grandchildren ? Will he tell us about his meeting witl
some named deceased friend ?
We shall probably know the main facts underlying these
names ; their citation is quite natural ; but it is too natural
it proves nothing. Nor does the appearance of these names
disprove anything. They leave the question where it was.
WiU he teU us of some laboratory experiment, say about
the suffocation of a dog ? We know that too.
Will he tell us of some epoch-making scientific novelty ?
He could equally well tell us of it now. If he does not, it
is probably because he does not specially know one,—does
not know much more than he has already pubhshed, or
read about in treatises by others. Why should a year or
two apart from his laboratory make him more cognisant of
physiology than he was here, with corpora vilia all round him
and instruments to hand ?
Will he tell us that he has met Raymond and G. P., and
perhaps even Phinuit and John King, and found them real after
all ? We shall not believe him ; or perhaps we shall ; but there
will be nothing to convince sceptics in such a statement.
Will he tell us that he has found out that the old control
we commonly speak of as Phinuit really was connected with
Marseilles once on a time, though he is foggy about the name
by which he was then known ? He will be telling us no I to
Tuore than Phinuit has already said,—without credence. ect
Will he tell us that somebody's son, now in robust health,
will have a hunting-accident before the year is out ? He
will probably not know it. And if he does suspect it, through
some source of information inaccessible to us,—well, hunting-
accidents are not infrequent, and mediums often make guesses,
and some of them come right by chance.
WiU he read some characteristic poetry, and speak his
admirable French ? The dramatising powers of a medium
are capable of anything.
WiU he read and transmit a sealed letter, finding that
matter is not so obstructive to mind as had been thought ?
That would be obvious cryptesthesia.
WiU he take some effluence from the medium and construct
a (not very good) likeness of himself, that we may have
objective proof of his existence ? It is no proof at aU, nor

ritiof anything except of a surprising formative power of the
unconscious.
Will he stand in front of a camera to be photographed ?
Most hkely no impression wiU be produced. If there is an
limpression, the photographer has done a good trick, or, rather,
an evil one.
Will he lament his purblind attitude to psychic phenomena
apart from material machinery, and teach us the joy of
emancipation and freedom from the flesh ? Hundreds have
done the same and not been believed.
Will he control a child and cause it to play music or do
calculations, or employ scientific terms ? Child prodigies have
long been known.
Will he make a special effort and take the trouble to learn
and recite some poem from the Classics, or to invent some
ecclesiastical or other Latin when controlling an illiterate
medium ? The verdict will be interesting, but the incident
should have been repeated." (The quotation is from p. 225.)
Will he extract some matter or secretion from the medium
and, welding it into solid form—as instructed by some who
have been making experiments longer than humanity,—will
he surprise the people present by hand-grasps and luminous
appearances and noisy blows ?—He will probably not be able
to do it ; but if he can get it done, then of course that is
ectoplasm, which is plainly a sort of substance simulating
inteUigence and really controlled by the unconsciousness of
the medium from whose body it emanated.
Will he cause an ignorant mediumistic woman to speak some
sentences in Arabic about his visit to Algiers ? He will only
raise wonder at the Xenoglossic power of an uneducated
medium ; and suspicion will be raised as to the truth of her
assertion if she maintains that she never knew anything like
Arabic.
Will he try to see and tell us what is being set up in type
before anything appears in print ? Or will he read something
in a closed book and convey that; so as to demonstrate his
new-found power of surpassing the ordinary obstructiveness
of matter ? It will be useless ; and will be regarded as an
argument against survival, and as a demonstration of the
extraordinary power of the medium's subconsciousness.
102 8ir Oliver Lodge. [part
Will he transmit some learned and peculiar phrase, or
narrate some incident in his past life unknown perhaps to{
any person but recorded in some private cipher ? The poweri
of the medium will be held to transcend time as well asj
space, and as it were, to witness the incident.
Will he tell us of a lost note-book in a railway carriage,
that it had a red star on the outside and some stamps stuck
into it on the inside, some of them foreign ones ? What
triviality to concern himself with such rubbish under new
and semi-divine conditions !
How will he proceed with his demonstration ? I really do
not know. Nor will he. Nor does he know now,—
Page 616. "Taking subjective facts alone, it [the spiritist
theory] is not demonstrated ; and the trying thing is
that one does^ not see how it could be demonstrated—
how it could be proved that human consciousness, with
its remembrance and its personality, had survived the
death of the brain."
But I can tell him this :—that when in due time he finds
himself on the other side, and meets a welcoming company,
with Myers and other friends and some kindred spirits of
whose sympathy and interest at present he is probably un-
aware, I feel sure that he will keenly discuss with them the
experiments they have made, and the various attempted plans
for convincing the world of spiritual existence apart from
ordinary matter; and will eagerly devise new experiments to
demonstrate what he will then perceive to be the real meaning
of his beloved nascent science of metapsychics. He will find
it more difficult than even he had imagined, and will be
perhaps chagrined at the sullenness and stupidity of those
down here whom he tries to influence. If he thinks he will
be able to demonstrate anything so preposterous as his own
permanent discarnate existence, he will find himself deeply
disappointed at the result. Any sort of explanation, or none
at all, will be considered better than that.
He may wish he had apprehended more nearly at their
true value, the attempts which have already been made;
he will realise how real and familiar surviving humanity still
is, even when divested of the old material instrument;" and
jxxxix.] Sequel to Revietv of A Text-Book of Metapsychics. 103
le will be amused at the idea, which he used to entertain,
)f there being only non-human entities among the manifold
Dossibilities of existence. Those there will be ; but he will
jind plenty of humanity too ; and he will realise that it
Vas not for nothing that they laboured and underwent much
j)bloquy and criticism, in their efforts to call their feUows
io a larger view of the universe, and to a recognition of a
vhole multitude—a whole sub-universe —of facts at present
ying outside the confines of organised knowledge.
That he already has a mind which is opening to perception
:)f deep underlying realities can be demonstrated by the passages
already cited on page 96—from the conclusion of his great
30ok ; and 1 hope that his whole-hearted acceptance of the
yeird and puzzling facts, of prevision on the subjective side,
md of ectoplasmic formation on the objective side, will cause
lim joy. That he will understand their possibility and theory
nuch better, until after further years of experience, may well
36 doubted ; but he will assuredly be glad that his instinct
'or truth had led him to overcome the prejudices of a life-
;ime, and admit unpalatable, or at least indigestible and un-
jxplained, facts. In those acceptances he has shown his
jpenmindedness and his strength ; and he has not hesitated
M uplift his standard before an International Congress of
Physiologists, meeting this summer of 1923 in Edinburgh.
Few, if any other, men of science would have been given
1 hearing on such an occasion and on such a subject !
And now in conclusion I must confess that in thus writing
and arguing, and perhaps rather trampling on conventions,
I am writing less for Richet himself than for others who
may be influenced by the views expressed in his book. As
regards his own philosophic attitude, he must choose his own
time and his own modes of expression. Diversities of view
are frequent in a nascent science ; and conservatism has its
advantages.
To go over too jDromptly from one camp to another would
be unwise. As a matter of policy, slow and leisurely de-
velopment is best ; and the influence of Richet reaches where
my own influence is already greatly discounted. Some, when
they see truth clearly, feel constrained to embrace it whole-

heartedly and risk everything ; others may think it wise:
to penetrate still deeper into her mysteries before rising t(
the surface and waving a beckoning hand to loiterers on th(
shore. Far be it from me to judge which is best. Eacl
must take his own line, and follow the course which to him
seems wisest. If his lot is to encounter ridicule and hostility
from his own generation, he is but sharing the experiences
of a very honourable company of predecessors.

I know well how difficult it is to accept a fact for which
one sees no sort of reason or explanation. Facts have been
neglected or denied, times without number, because no rational
explanation could be given. To take only two instances, one-
from Physics, one from Biology :
—
Kepler and many others suspected some relation between'
the moon and the tides. Numerous facts suggested such a
connexion ; a Spring tide soon after new and full moon was,
the most obvious ; the interval between consecutive day-tidesi ain(
corresponding more nearly to the lunar day than to the solari^"!'*
day, was another.
But what on earth could the moon accomplish, from its
position a quarter million miles away ! So the idea was
regarded as superstitious ; and Galileo, as an orthodox ex-
perimentalist and mechanician, chaffed Kepler for his fanciful
and credulous belief.
Only when Newton displayed the machinery, and proved
that even bodies at a distance really did influence each other,
through some unknown intervening substance or mechanism,
did the belief gain general acceptance. Thereafter its details
could be and were worked out, until it became established
as a commonplace of general elementary knowledge.
As the other example, I take the changes popularly supposed
to be wrought in the foetus, during pregnancy, by some
influence or shock or other experience of the mother, so that
the offspring bears signs of the functional disturbance.
That this has been regarded as a superstition, and perhaps
in some quarters still is, hardly needs showing ; but recently
I learn, from Sir Arthur Keith's admirable lecture, in a supple-

nent to Nature of date 18th August, 1923, that Biologists are
5 1( jeginning to accept the fact ; not because of specific instances,
4 Dut because they see some chance of understanding how such
at! reverberation or intercommunication could come about through
i change in secretions, so that an impression on one individual
ilili
30uld cause sympathetic response in another.
Dfs What I call attention to is that the numerous instances
')f its actual occurrence were insufficient to prevent their
jither being denied or else attributed to coincidence ;
—that
'oroad-backed sustainer of anything we find it inconvenient
or unattractive to believe. Sometimes the authoritj^ for the
"act was unimpeachable, but that alone was not enough. I
M nust quote from Keith's lecture :
—
In 1868 Darwin related " the case of a cow in which one
* jye was injured when she was in calf. The calf was born
with the corresponding eye small and blind. In more recent
p'ears Marey has recorded an identical result in a mare
;
me eye was injured when she was pregnant, and the foal
;v^as born with the corresjjonding eye small and blind.
Sitherto we liave been inclined to regard such cases as mere
ioincidences, but the well Imown experiments of Guyer and
Smith provide a rational explanation."
This " rational explanation " was provided by the experiment
—published in 1921—of injecting a substance, having a selective
ind toxic action on the lens of the eye, into the veins of
doe rabbits at the end of the second week of pregnancy ;
and then finding that the young rabbits, when born, showed
ibhe
defect to be expected, and that also many of their sub-
sequent progeny were afflicted with cataract.
" These experiments show that the germ plasm can be reached
from without."
Probably a few biologists must have claimed that the facts
of observation had alreadj^ demonstrated this, apart from special
experiment ; but they may have been set aside as cranks.
Another example might be found in the superstition which
seemed to connect the effect of the malaria or " bad air " of
the Campagna with the prevalence of a noxious insect.
1 Experiments in metaphysics are much to be desired. When
Ifwe know the kind of secretion which"; in a"^ medium enables
jthe formation of ectoplasm, and the consequent temporary

construction of organic forms which appear subject to in
teUigent control of some kind, general disbelief in the pheno
nienon will not continue to react adversely on the progres
of science.
If is surely reasonable to maintain that curious and puzzling
and superficially incredible phenomena should be taken as
hints for enquiry and suggestions for experiment. To denj'
and to ignore, is easy and popular and respectable, and per
sonally advantageous in the present state of popular prejudice,
but it is an unworthy attitude to be taken up by the heirs
of those great precursors who overcame the danger of public
opprobrium and first laid the foundations of free and un-
fettered enquiry into all the facts of nature.
The strength of Richet's position is that he fully accepts
the phenomena, or such of them as have been well evidenced,
without at all feeUng that he has the clue to their explanation.'
To dechne to contemplate facts, or to take such an a priori
attitude that experience of them is impossible, is not the
faihng of Professor Richet ; and by trying to abstain from
any theory—or when that becomes impossible by showing
a liking for a materialistic one,—his book may carry an
influence into unhkely quarters.
Hence those who have the credit of science at heart, and
have some hope that the next generation of scientific' men
will overcome the very natural hostile prejudice of their im-
mediate predecessors, may appreciate the value of Prof. Richet's
attitude, even if they feel constrained here and there to dis-
agree with it; and in that spirit I for one admire the long
years of attention which Richet has given to a despised subject,
and cordially welcome the appearance of the Traite de Meta-
psychique.

FOR AND AGAINST SURVIVAL.
The Difficulty of Survival from the Scientific
Point of View.
By Professor Charles Richet,
Membre de I'lnstitut ; Professor of Physiology in the University of Paris ;
Past President of the S.P.R.
[n my numerous writings I have resolutely adhered to
bhe position of not admitting as demonstrated the
mrvival of consciousness. Nevertheless, it may be that
2iy negative attitude is somewhat more strongly repre-
sented in my writings than in my intimate thought.
There are facts so unexpected, so perturbing, continually
cropping up as we continue to study the subject, pre-
^
renting themselves with such disconcerting rapidity and
« complexity, that it would be inexcusable for me to
! ieny, without hesitation, all possibility of the survival
)i consciousness.
It therefore appears to me wise to make a reserve in
ny negation. If it is true—as I have often maintained
—
hat the most reasonable h3rpothesis is the unknown
lypothesis X, which it will be for the future to develop,
t is very possible that this hypothesis X need not be
i 1

antagonistic to the spiritistic hypothesis. In fact, I do
not wish to expose myself to the chance of seeing my
negations suddenly reversed by new experiments ;
so,
although I do not expect this to happen, my attitude of
prudence may be pardoned. At the same time, in spit^
of my prudence, I am forced to regard the spiritistic hypo-
thesis, not only as undemonstrated, but, still more, as being
in formal opposition to a great number of facts.
Let it be well understood that I am not at all con-
cerned to know whether survival is agreeable or dis-
agreeable, nor whetlier I am in accord or disaccord with
any particular brand of religious opinion : it is not
things of that kind which occupy my mind, but only a
question of fact—the truth.
II.
To what then is the spiritistic hypothesis in opposition 1
First of all, very briefly, there is Physiology, that is
to say a very precise science, rich in demonstrations,
which have estabhshed by innumerable proofs a narrow
rigorous parallehsm between intellectual functions—other-'
wise called memory—and the brain.
Moreover, in the immense animal kingdom there is no'
gap, no hiatus. The monkey and the dog have a memory
analogous to that of man : the hen and the tortoise can
be compared with the monkey and the dog : then the
fish and the octopus : then all the other animals, down
to the worms. Consciousness, mobihty, sensitiveness, are
functions of the nervous system ; so that it is necessary
to suppose, not only the survival of the human conscious-
ness, but also the survival of all animal memories.
That is a grave consideration, and I am not resigned
to it.
^
too
Jlllj
is i]
But the spiritists do not admit what my illustrious
friend Oliver Lodge humorously calls "the fetish of the
brain." For myself, without being able to give a firm
demonstration (for one cannot prove a negative), I cannot
beheve that memory can exist without the anatomical p
and physiological integrity of the brain. Whenever there

is no more oxygen, whenever the temperature is either
too low or too high, when there are a few drops of
atropine or morphine or chloroform introduced into the
blood, whenever the course of cerebral irrigation is
stopped—memory alters and disappears. Sj)iritists cannot
deny these facts. They say merely that the brain is
only an instrument, which is unable to respond unless it
is intact. And it is by reasoning of another order that
they try to prove that the instrument is not necessary.
But that is another grave consideration. It is as if
I were to say that in an electric lamp the passage of
the current and the integrity of the mechanism of the
lamp are not necessary for the production of its hglit.
III.
But let us proceed and come to the direct proofs.
Following the classification that I have formulated, they
can be related to subjective metapsychics or to objective
metapsychics.
Now in subjective metapsychics we have a great number
of facts proving that human intelhgence has means of
acquiring information other than through normal sensory
oharmels ; and that it acquires this information under
conditions which exclude the attribution of this super-
lensorial knowledge (or cryptaesthesia) to the presence of an
individuahty which has survived the death of the brain.
When Ossowiecki reads the word " toi " that I have
written on a scrap of paper held all crumpled up in my
hand, or when he indicates a verse of Rostand that
I don't know and that Mme de Noailles had enclosed
in a carefully sealed letter, there is no need to suppose
the intervention of the soul of a deceased person. There
is perception or knowledge of reality : that is all.
And this perception or knowledge is profoundly
mysterious. We might say that it has, so to speak, no
limit known to us. We are not leaving the scientific
iomain if we say that cryptaesthesia can reveal to us
fragments of the real—fragments which seem to have no
3onnexion with space and time.

Since the facts are so, since cryptaesthesia in these cases
is apparently not connected with the agency of any
discarnate person, I do not at all see why, in spite
of appearances—sometimes startUng and disturbing—one
should feel authorised to suppose that the individuaUty
of some dead person has retained his consciousness, his
memory, and is there in order to make revelations to
us. It is a hypothesis wliich is not at all necessary,
given the mysterious and vast extent of cryptaesthesic
power.
Consequently, all the revelations of the discarnate about
their old hfe can be logically attributed to this power
of cryptaesthesia.
Nevertheless, I do not overlook two facts :
(1) That
genuine mediums have an invincible tendency to attribute
their answers to a spirit of the dead : all their phrases
are saturated with the spiritistic hypothesis ; and it was
so even in the beginning of their career, when they had
practically no knowledge of spiritistic Uterature. (2) We
must admit—what is not very satisfactory—that mediums
have a way of selecting minute details in the hfe and
habits of a definite discarnate person in order to utiUse
or adapt them in their answers. Sir Ohver Lodge and
E. Bozzano have insisted on the difficulty there is in
understanding this selection in the messages. So much
so that in certain very rare cases the hypothesis of
survival is much less far-fetched than the hypothesis of
selective cryjjtaesthesia.
But these reasons, which I frankly bring forward in
all their force, do not hinder me from conclucUng that by
subjective metapsychics one cannot render hkely the
theory of survival.
One must here remark that we have not taken into
account the wholesale nonsense furnished by automatic
writing in thousands of experiments. Even for the most
hardened spiritist there is not one communication in a
thousand which is not ridiculous : it behoves one there-
fore to be very cautious about the thousandth observation,
even when it has rather striking features.

Let us remain a moment longer in subjective meta-
psychics and consider the most extraordinary facts in the
whole of known science, that is to say Premonitions.
It must be understood that I by no means deny the
reality of certain premonitions ; I have quoted remarkable
•examples of them which have happened to me personally :
and in the annals of our science there are astonishing
examples. But premonition has nothing to do with
survival. It remains an absolutely incomprehensible
phenomenon for our puny intelhgence. One cannot see
how this phenomenon, which .shocks so brutally our
sense of free will, can ever be understood.
That matters httle. It is an undeniable fact ; and
it proves to us the sheer impossibility, as yet, of finding
any explanation for metapsychic phenomena. But I do
not propose an explanation or a theory. When I speak
of cryptaesthesia I indicate a fact—the perception of
reahty by extra-sensorial channels. I do not seek to
go beyond that, and as yet science has no right to go
beyond that.
V.
What strongly confirms this opinion, about our scien-
tific powerlessness in coming to a conclusion, are the
experiences of Objective metapsychics ; for they prove
to us that we are still plunged in thick darkness. When
an ectoplasmic formation comes out of the body of
Eusapia, of D. D. Home, of Mss Gohgher, of Eva, or
of WiUy, we can only properly conclude that from the
bodies of mediums can be disengaged sometimes forces
having objective reahty, which can be moulded, and
jjjl photographed, and can assume the most diverse appear-
ances. What connexion can there be between these
jg.
materiahsations of human forms and the survival of
memory 1 I cannot see any.
Moreover, there are not only materiahsations of human
forms, but also materiahsations of veils, head-dresses.

clothes, animals., various objects ; to such an extent that I
we cannot doubt that the power of materiahsation or of siii
producing ectoplasm is not limited to human personahties.
I know well that in certain cases, in particular the case ne'
of Mr. Cushman [American Journal S.P.R., April, 1922,
pp. 132 to 147), the photograph of the phantom represents
very exactly the face of the young deceased daughter
of Mr. Cushman. But even in this remarkable case, if tni
there is not some error or trickery, it is impossible to
suppose that the body of this young girl had not been
decomposed by the decay of the tomb. We cannot
really suppose that the forms of living people perpetuate
themselves after death. It must be the materiahsation of
something tvhich has existed and which no longer exists.
To admit that is to enter a world absolutely unknown.
It is possible that one day it may be admitted ; but
to-day we stand plunged into an abyss of deeper and
deeper mysteries. It would mean, not only the survival Mi
of memory, but the survival of the chemical elements
which constitute our body, and which retain somehow enl
their molecular arrangement, in spite of incineration and
putrefaction.
Thus objective metapsychics gives no support whatever
to the theory of survival. It teaches us only this—that,
so far, we have understood nothing, absolutely nothing, t|i(
of all these phenomena.

And now to conclude. Unknown truths, immense ph
unforeseen horizons, open before us. Let us not hasten
to build up a fragile theory. The further we advance
the more the shadows thicken. The old Egyptians had
ah-eady supposed that a human being survived the
disintegration of its human tatters. They put into the
sarcophagus of their dead ones, cakes, toys, and jewels.
The anthropomorphism of the spiritist is of the same
order. Truth, under the profound veils which cover it,
must be far more noble than this antiquated idea
—
the
'prolongation of our miserable individual intellectuality.
xc] For and Against Survival. 113
I deny nothing. I claim only that the theory of
survival has some extremely feeble evidence in its favour,
but against it a series of innumerable inductions. In
view of the rapid progress of the sciences, and the pro-
found change in all our conceptions, it must be held to
constitute only a revival of very ancient superstitions.
The evolution of science will lead us to more splendid
truths.
FOR AND AGAINST SURVIVAL.
The Possibility of Survival from the Scientific
Point of View.
By Sir Olfver Lodge.
My good and eminent friend Professor Richet has made
an admirable statement or synoptic summary of the
enhghtened materialistic position in regard to the pheno-
mena studied in Psychic Research, and recorded in his
great book, Traite de Metapsychique. His statement
would not be accepted by the great majority of his
colleagues, who being unacquainted with the facts are
therefore comparatively benighted ; but the interesting-
thing is that though Professor Riohet knows facts which
in some of their aspects conflict with materiahsm, he yet
is able to remain a materiahst.
No offence is intended by this term : it is a definite
philosophical position. It is well to have this position
competently sustained, so far as the phenomena specially
under consideration are concerned, and so far as it has
a bearing on our acceptance or rejection of the possibihty
or reasonableness of human survival. If Professor Richet's
stronghold can be stormed, it is unhkely that any
successor will be able to entrench himself in a fortress
of equal soHdity.
Richet shows himself remarkably open minded, for he
says, " I deny nothing " ; he also shows himself a
thorough agnostic, for he says that we are still plunged
114 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part
in thick darkness and have no chie to these mysteries.
But here is just where I differ from him. I am less
open-minded, for I want to deny a good deal. I am
less agnostic, for I have a working hypothesis, which I
desire to verify or else explode.
Now although Professor Richet is acquainted with the
facts, I venture to say that he is not yet acquainted
with my version of the spiritistic point of view ;
which
I might call " our theory " except that I have no right
to involve other people in a disputed and unorthodox
position. Why should he be acquainted with it ? If I
have indicated my theoretical views at all, it has always
been in a faint and apologetic manner, because I want
to confront them always with the facts, and because I
wish to emphasise the facts themselves rather than any
opinion or theories about them. But with my friend
Professor Richet I must take a different hne. There is
no need to weary him by insistence on the facts,—though
about a few of the subjective kind I have a more favour-
able opinion than he has ;
just as on the objective side
he has had advantages of investigation denied to me,
—
what is troubling him throughout is the lack of theory.
He bravely faces the lacuna. He does not seek to devise
opposition theories. He is content to say that the facts
are mysterious and inexplicable and rather crazy, when
interpreted as orthodox science feels bound to interpret
them.
And with that hmitation—the limitation which orthodox
science at present imposes on itself—crazy and incredible
is what they are. Still more crazy must our theories
about them seem. But new facts often require new
theory for their interpretation. There are things in the
universe which biological science has not yet taken into
account. If or when it does proceed to take another
entity of physical existence into account, it will find its
difficulties gradually disappearing. And Richet himself
win feel sooner or later that he can have a clue to his
facts, a link on which to thread them, a point of view
which will enable him to interpret them in a more hospi-
table and less dumbfounded manner.
xc] For and Against Survival. 115
From his present point of view no wonder they appear
strange, troubhng, mysterious and incredible. The marvel
is that his loyalty to truth and to fact has enabled him
to accept them at all, as part of the reahty of the
Universe. That is just what they are : but then some
other things are hkewise part of reahtj^. And when we
accept and incorporate the Ether into our scheme—
a
thing at present totally ignored by biological science, and
indeed ignored by all science except one-half of the
science of Physics—the horizon will begin to brighten,
the mist roll away, and a star, if not a sun, will begin
to illuminate the darkness.
I said that I wanted to deny as well as to assert.
Professor Richet refrains from denying, but some of his
assertions are rash. He denies with hesitation : he
asserts with vigour—a procedure in general quite admir-
able ; but on this occasion I am going rashly to take an
opposite course. I am going to deny with vigour and
assert with hesitation. Only, for the sake of lucidity
and brevity, I may find it best to throw my assertions
into a positive and dogmatic form, which ill suits the
subject were it not for this explanation. And I must
trust my critics clearly to apprehend that when I turn
from denials to assertions I am only formulating a
working hypothesis, only making an effort to frame a
rational conception of the manner and method of human
survival.
The evidence for survival ought to stand on its own
merits, without being hampered by effete superstitions.
I wish to deny and repudiate some of those superstitions
in a forcible manner ; and in this I know that I am in
agreement with all the more reasonable spiritists. Professor
Richet, and perhaps some others in the physiological
camp, seem to want to carry these superstitions over
from " the dark ages " into the era of Science ; but
this must not be allowed. The subject is difficult enough
without these unnecessary and impossible accretions.
My first denial then is of anything Uke the resuscitation
116 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PABT
of a corpse. Humanity for many centuries has been
accustomed to think of people being put into a grave,
there to bide their time for some future event : and those
who hold or try to hold that view would be indisposed
to accept any appearances of the departed unless they
could find their empty tomb. Now we maintain that
the idea of a resuscitated body wandering about is absurd ;
although the history of folk-lore shows that beUefs of
this kind were held : and a stake was sometimes driven
through the body of a suicide in order to keep it quiet.
The reason for this preposterous practice was no doubt
similar to that which Professor Richet now expresses,
viz. that the personahty is so entirely associated with
the material body that any visible and tangible appearance
of that personality must necessarily be taken to mean
that the corpse was used for the purpose. And during
the Middle Ages some even of the Fathers of the Church
apparently could not dissociate the idea of ultimate
resurrection from the notion of an abandoned grave, a
collection of the body's original particles, a composing
of them together, and a revivification. But the facts
give no justification for such an idea. And those who
hold the spiritistic view are as wllhng as any Physiologist
is to admit all the facts about disintegration, decomposi-
tion, incineration, and the rest. The materialistic survivals
of folk-lore must be utterly discarded.
If it be found that an apparition or phantom has the
features and bodily marks of the discarded instrument of
manifestation, then those facts will have to be accepted,
and an explanation sought elsewhere. No explanation
based on the revivification of the corpse can be accepted
for a moment. It is true that it seems like the obvious
and childish explanation : but in the fight of modern
knowledge it ought to be discarded as extinct. When
we say that the facts uphold the doctrine of survival, we do
not mean that I
The ancient Egyptian practices, and their idea of death
must have been troublesome and painful. The notion
that the surviving soul or Ka required meats and furniture
and appfiances, which were therefore put into the tomb
xc] For and Against Survival. 117
ior its sustenance and convenience, belongs to the childish
Age of humanity, and must have given great anxiety to
survivors, especiallj" poor survivors, lest they had for-
gotten something necessary, or lest they had not made
adequate provision for their beloved's future existence.
Mechfeval ecclesiastical behefs were in many respects
better than that. It must have been painful to put the
loved person into the earth and leave him in the cold and
dark for unkno-mi centuries ; but at anj^ rate they had
faith that the bodily part would be at peace until sum-
moned again and reconstituted by Divine Power. They
had anxieties and troubles enough however about the
soul, which they were told might be in torment unless
they mvoked the supernataral power of the priesthood.
This fear must have given so much pain that really those
behefs were hardly superior to the more ancient behefs of
the Egj^tians. It is known, however, that the phi'ase
•'•'resurrection of the body"" is capable of adaptation and
Teasonable interpretation by behevers ; as explained e.g. in
2Ian and the Universe, and in Part III of Rayniond.
But with Ecclesiastical practices, science has nothing
to do. It ought to regard the facts from a totally new
and different aspect. We ought to maintain, and we do
maintain, that the material body has served its turn and
is utterly discarded and done with, that its particles can
be used again for other forms of hfe, and that no sort
•of identity or personahty remains associated with them.
As to what becomes of the personahty, and what
instrument now serves its turn, that is a matter for
investigation ; that is what we have to learn. Xo question
of priestcraft should be associated -ndth it : it is a
straightforward scientific enquiry. It may be that we
do not know. But on the other hand it may be that
we can frame a working h\-pothesis. Such a hypothesis
is growing in my mind : and the beginnings of it were
in the mind of St. Paul, of Clement of Alexandria, of
Origen, and other Greek Fathers of the Church. Very
hkely their ideas were condemned as heretical at the time ;
but that does not prove them imtrue.
To avoid mistmderstanding, I should hke to say here
118 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part
that in all I have said I am referring to ordinary bodies
and ordinary people. If there is a case for an exceptional
Body, and for a different treatment in one particular
instance, so that one Tomb was really empty, that is not
a matter to which I wish to refer here. I may have
more to say about that in a proper time and place.
Meanwhile I am deahng with the apparitions and the
fate of ordinary people. The facts suggest, what is
rather the point at issue, that they do sometimes appear :
but the fact is certain that their material bodies remain
in the tomb, or wherever else they were deposited by
survivors. If this is fully admitted and thoroughly
accepted, a crude materialistic explanation of the facts
is put out of court, and the ground is to that extent
cleared. The enquiry may now proceed freed from this
encumbrance of folk-lore. There is no survival of the
material body
!
Nevertheless, those of us who consider that we are
really in touch, sometimes, with surviving personaKties,
are told by those personalities that they have " bodies
"
just as real and substantial as they used to have, that
they find themselves signally unchanged, that they pre-
serve the same appearance, so that they can be recognised;
that it is by means of these bodies or instruments of
manifestation that they are aware of and communicate
with each other, and that by aid of them they occasion-
ally communicate with us. How can these statements
be reconciled with what has just been said ? Well, that
is where comes in my working hypothesis—a hypothesis
not accepted by me alone ])ut by many others who are
feeling their way in the same direction, a hypothesis
which we can read into many of St. Paul's words, and
which we therefore think that that inspired genius caught
some ghmpse of, though he could not have formulated it
in modern terms.
If I am tempted to call it " my hypothesis," it is
because—apart altogether from psychical conditions—I have
made a life-long study of the Ether of Space ; so that to
me it seems a more famihar and substantial and practical
entity than it is likely to be to people who have not
!r xc] For and Against Survival. 119
s made that study, and to whom it seems something indefinite,
al vague, and imaginary.
ir Among scientific men the Ether has only been studied
)t by Physicists, and not by all of them. It has been
e ignored by Chemists, qua Chemists, and has probably
I

le
I
of any kind, at all. And yet if it is a reaMty in the
is 'Universe it may have chemical and biological functions
: to perform, as well as its well known functions in the
1 [science of Physics. We know it familiarly in the pheno-
Hmena of Light, of Electricity, of Magnetism. We are
r beginning to associate it also, rather definitely, with
s Elasticity, Cohesion, and Gravitation. And we are
t gradually learning that the greater part of the energy
f in the Universe, and certainly all potential energy, belongs
e to it, and not to matter at all. Atomic matter is one
thing : the Ether is another. They may be related ; in
e fact they are related. The hnk between them is electricity,
i. But if it is possible ever to unify them, and to regard
them as different manifestations of one thing, there is
t no doubt which is the more fundamental of the two.
The Ether is the fundamental thing. Matter is a derived
: and secondary thing. And the electric charges which
f constitute matter are probably composed of modifications
t of the Ether.
This really is orthodox Physics, though it is not yet so
> substantiated that all Physicists must necessarily agree with
[ it. There may be legitimate differences of opinion, but it is
< a recognised and reasoned scientific view. It is well founded,
r it is deduced from the facts, and is entirely independent of
> any psychic considerations.
[. Suppose then, for purposes of argaiment, that we allow
: the Ether in the physical universe to have the functions
: which most physicists attribute to it : then it becomes a
definite question whether it ought not to be taken into
- account in philosophic discussion, and in the long run in
'
biological theory too.
I To explain all that I have said on the side of physics
1 would need something like a treatise. In this discussion I
[ must be brief, and must appear to be more hypothetical than
120 Sir Oliver Lodge. [pabt
I am. Still when we come to Biology we are bound to be
hypothetical. And the working hypothesis that I promul
gate must be held hghtly, until the facts, studied long and
carefully, are found to substantiate it, and constitute it
a reasonable clue to phenomena which, though real, seem
otherwise inexphcable.
To Professor Richet the facts seem quite inexplicable.
He feels that he is working in the dark, and that " the
only safe statement is to say that we really know nothing,
absolutely nothing, about the Universe."' From this
point of view, my agnosticism is not so deep as his. I
feel that we have a clue, and that it is only by following
it up that we shall find out whether it is a trustworthy
clue or not. Any clue is better than none. Discon-
nected facts, not joined by any thread of theory, are
intractable and confusing things. They can hardly be
said to belong to Science, which means a system of
organised knowledge. And it is because they lack the
clue, that Biologists in general feel so hostile, and are
conscious of such repugnance, to the facts themselves.
To the honour of Professor Richet, in spite of his repug-
nance, he is ready to accept the facts. But it seems to
me that he raises unnecessary difficulties about them by
his insistence on matter alone. He will never under-
stand them in terms of " matter " alone. Strictly
speaking, we cannot understand anything fully and com-
pletely in terms of matter alone. By concentrating on
matter we eliminate from our thoughts the greater part
of the Universe. The Universe contains many things
besides matter. It contains magnetism and electricity
and light and ether ; it also contains life and thought
and mind and consciousness and memory and personahty
and character. None of these things are material ; and
yet, strangely enough, some of them have come into
association with matter through the curious biological
process of Incarnation. For a time intelligences do
inhabit material bodies which, by barely known processes,
they have unconsciously constructed. It is evident that
there exists a formative principle, which is able to deal
Avith the atoms of matter, or rather with the more com-

)lex molecules into which the atoms have already grouped
themselves : and thus, by aid of the energy which these
nolecules receive from the sun, non-material entities are
iible to manifest themselves famiharly in association with
natter. So vivid is the connexion that we have learnt
.0 identify them with their material modes of manifes-
ation, and to imagine that they cannot otherwise exist.
We do not know why they require a habitation or
nstrument belonging to the physical universe ; but we
nay assume that for some unknowoa reason they do.
iVe know that they make use of matter, though we know
lot how or why. But the facts now show that associa-
ion with matter is not essential to their existence. We
nay assume that they can make use of something else,
f the facts point that way. My working hypothesis is
hat they are more closely associated with the Ether than
vith matter, that they act primarily and directly on the
Sther, and only indirectly on matter, and that they are
ble to continue in their Ether habitations when the
naterial particles are worn out and discarded. In justifi-
iation for this I wish to say, as a physicist, that most,
)ossibly all, of our actions on matter are exerted through
he Ether : some obviously, like propulsion by electric
notors, others less conspicuously, but just as really,
vherever force crosses empty space. For atoms are never
n contact.
But we have no sense organs for the Ether. To our
iresent animal senses it is entirely elusive. Hence we
hall know nothing about any personalities associated only
sdth an Ether body unless they can operate on our senses
n some way. To do this they must operate on matter,
^et us suppose then that they can extract organised
naterial and mould it, as a sculptor moulds his clay or
LS a painter treats his pigments, until they have fashioned
i material representation which we may be able to see
i-nd touch, and which, if imbued with energy, may per-
orm physical actions, such as the motion of objects.
This is not an unfounded guess ; for we know that
he famihar material body has been built up in its present
lefinite shape out of food not in the least hke it ; that
122 Sir Oliver Lodge. [par
the shape of the material body depends on the formativi
organising principle, not on the aliment provided. Tha
is the peculiarity of live things. They are able to display
themselves, to exhibit their own shape, by means of an^
kind of wholesome material. In this they are unlik(
crystals, of which the shape is entirely dependent on th(
nutriment supplied.
We have, therefore, only to suppose that this formativf
principle or constructive power persists. And we neec
not have any great difficulty in supposing, if the fact:
warrant and suggest the idea, that this same formative
principle can continue to act occasionally even on matter
when suitable organised protoplasmic material is provided
and that the material can be moulded into the same hke-
ness as of old, although imperfectly and very temporarily.
In this general way, therefore, I would seek to account
for objective metapsychical phenomena. That deceased
human beings are often thus engaged need not be assumed.
The formative unconscious power or principle may be.
miich more general than that, but it must also be
specific. In an egg the formative principle exists which
constructs a bird ; from the ovvim of a dog, a dog
emerges : the formative principle in an acorn constructs
an oak. The construction is in every familiar case
specific. So if human hands and faces are produced,|
or even if things like garments and veils are imitated,
it is not unreasonable to suppose that some human, ^"
element—in the latter case perhaps a conscious element
—
is somehow concerned in the production.
Subjective metapsychics is still easier to associate with
human survival. The controlling immaterial entity, the
hving personality, was known, while here, to be able to
operate on the cells of its brain, so as not only to move
muscles but thereby to convey ideas intelUgible to other
similar personalities who were acquainted with the con-
ventional signs or language. And it is a question of
evidence whether this power of operating on brains can
be extended to other brains, so that a personaUty which
has lost the use of its own instrument may be able,
with difficulty and by permission, to work similarly on

he brain of some hospitable person who partially vacates
lis instrument in trance, or who allows part of it to be
ised for moving either his hand in writing or his organs
)f speech. If so, the ideas thus conveyed may mainly
)elong and be largely appropriate, not to the host or
'
medium," but to the actuating personahty or " control."
Chough admittedly the habit and cultivation of the
uedium's brain may to some extent hamper free and
'msophisticated and fully intelhgent control, and may
tecessitate a judicious selection of topics or of language,
uch as the instrument may be able to transmit Mdthout
indue and telergic effort.
It is unnecessary to elaborate this further, because
hese are the facts which more strongly than any others
lemonstrate survival. Whether the evidence, as yet,
:onstitutes proof is a perfectly reasonable thing to discuss ;
,nd there may be differences of opinion. But no artificial
Objections need be raised by the difficulty of realising
low it can possibly be done. The appearances are
ixactly as if the simple explanation were the true one.
^nd there have been several cases in science where, after
triving for a more complicated theory, we have found
ifter all that Reality and Appearance were not so different
bS had been surmised. For instance, after much hesitation
ve had to decide that the red appearances round the sun
it the time of an' eclipse, which looked hke flames,
eally were flames and not anything less familiar. Again,
v^hen in old days the Danish astronomer, Roemer, sought
o explain certain curious anomalies in the motion of
Tupiter's Satelhtes, by the supposition that light had a
inite velocity and took a measurable time to bring the
nformation—the suggestion was in most quarters scouted
iS too simple and ad Jioc an explanation ; and under the
lame " the equation of light," it was rejected and unused
or the best part of a century ; until an independent
.nd quite different observation by the Enghsh astronomer
Sradley required a similar explanation, and thereby estab-
ished it beyond dispute. The messenger had lagged on
he journey—that was all.
Let it not be supposed, however, that the discovery of
124 Sir Oliver Lodge. [par"
the finite rate of propagation of light is a small dis'
COvery ;
it has turned out to have the most portentous
consequences ;
for, as we learn from Einstein, the velocitj
of light is perhaps the only absolute and unchangeablt
thing in the physical universe.
So I expect it will be with the spiritistic hypothesis
in some developed form. Childishly simple as it appears
seemingly more appropriate to primitive man than tc
Fellows of the Royal Society, it may turn out not onlj
to be true but to involve consequences of tremendous
moment to mankind ; indeed it may outweigh all othei
discoveries in its influence on human will and conduct !
I have been led on in a more positive direction than
I had intended, and have broken off my catalogue oi
denials, such as I thought Professor Richet's article
called for. Denial is no pleasure to me : and I have
nothing so fundamental to deny as the resuscitation
and utihsation of corpses—a procedure which, if it were
possible, might legitimately be stigmatised as necromancy.
But there are a few sentences in Professor Richet's article
to which I wish to oppose a negative. They are as
follows :
—
First, the imphcation (by the use of the word " cannot ")
that any reasonable holder of the spiritistic view would
liU to deny physiological and pathological facts if he were
able. It is not a question of " camiot," it is a question
of • do not " : we accept them fully. If the instrument
is out of order or interfered with or drugged, no sign of
intelhgence can be made. Injure a person's brain, and
his mind is cut off from our ken. It is isolated, not
annihilated. Mind and Brain belong to different cate-
gories. A brickbat is a curious weapon against a mind,
but it is effective against a brain. IMind belongs to
psychology, not to physiology.
Second, that any sen.sible people hold that an instru-
ment is not necessary for communication and response.
On the contrary, they hold that it is necessary, quite
necessary, and that that is the use of a medium. If an

current must pass or you will get no light. Integrity of
some instrument is essential to rational communication.
Thirdly, that 999 communications out of a thousand
are ridiculous. If we eliminate obvious nonsense and
lunacy, the statement is not true. If it were true it
would indeed be a damning fact. Being a question of
fact, it is important : and I maintain that communica-
tions obtained through reputable and tested and genuine
mediums are nearly all of them sensible, are often of
surprising interest, and are sometimes of value. In this
matter I claim to have had more experience than my
friend. The volumes of the S.P.R. Journal and Pro-
ceedings contain plenty of instances, and many more are
,| known to me and to my readers. Indeed, in this
country and in America the multitude of rational, and
sometimes ingeniously devised and extremely evidential,
communications is overwhelming.
But it will be objected, the facts whole will not
be content with that simple idea—the idea of the vicarious
use of other people's brain-nerve -muscle mechanism for
the transmission of messages from a surviving etherially-
embodied once-incarnate personality—even if that idea can
be rationahzed. The notion of human survival beyond
bodily death is well able to account for simple personal
communications to surviving relatives, messages of affection
and advice, and things of that sort. Those are what have
suggested the idea. It is obvious that that is their
superficial appearance. The notion may also serve most
naturally to account for the incidents of classical scholar-
ship, and hterary allusion, beyond the scope of the
medium's learning or cultivation. But Subjective Meta-
psychics contains many other phenomena besides these.
It contains travelling clairvoyance, for instance, when
information is given about what is happening at a
distance, or when apparently telepathic effects are produced
across a continent ;
or, more puzzhng still, when sealed
documents and unopened books are read ; and. most
puzzling of all, when future events are predicted. Do

I seriously claim to have the beginnings of a working [^J*
hypothesis sufficient to account for these things ? i
Well, I do ! Let me try to expound it tentatively ir
a few words. i
The dissociation of personahty from the restrictions ol
the material body need not only occur at death. Some
people may have rather loose connexion during life
Their animated etherial vehicle, or some part of it, may
indistinctly be conceived as able to wander during sleep,
or to leave the main part of the body during trance.
Usually only the spirit is supposed to leave at such
times—by those who hold that there is such a thing as
spirit—and possibly that may ])e sufficient for the purposes
of travelhng clairvoyance and for cryptaesthesic sensibihty ;i
but if it turns out that a spirit must have a habitation
of some kind, I shall not be deterred from pressing an
etherial body into the service. The facts may not
necessitate it, or they may. We shall see.
But how are we to account for the reading of sealed
envelopes, the penetration of opaque obstacles ? Well,
opacity is a thing that can be treated physically. Iti^pe
means that waves of hght cannot get through : they are
either reflected back, or they are absorbed and turned
into heat, by an opaque body. A conducting metal
represents one type, a "black body" the other type of toy
opacity ; and there are all grades of obstruction to ether
waves. But opacity does not mean that nothing can
get through. I am not prepared with a physical explana-
tion of how these clairvoyant things can be done. The
phenomenon is to me the most puzzling of all. I doubt
if it can be solved in terms of " matter." No adeciuate port
attempt has yet been made to solve it in terms of
•'
Ether." X-rays give us a hint : but I am not sure
that it is done in a physical way at all. There is some
evidence—not much—that the contents of the book have
to be, or have had to be, in some person's mind : and
whether that which has once caused a mental impression
can for that reason be more easily read, or whether the
information is somehow mentally conveyed by other than luid
a physical process, I do not know. I am not afraid of a

ini Dhysical explanation, but prefer to wait for more know-
edge of the facts.
Those who have read Dr. Eugene Osty's book called
Supernormal Faculties in Man,^ now translated by Mr.
Stanley de Brath, will be astonished at the remarkable
nstances, that have come mainly within his own experi-
ence, of trustworthy clairvoyant and diagnostic faculty ;
50 that this eminent physician and neurologist is able to
ipply what he caUs metagnomy, and Richet calls cryptaes-
}hesia, to the understanding and rehef of severe bodily
icl|iilments. He gives examples not only of diagnosis,
—
)ften by means of what is frequently called psychometry,
:rom a piece of cloth or other object belonging to the
Datient,—he also gives examples of prognosis, sometimes
T^erified ; and a few instances of what might here be
stigmatised as " fortune-telHng." The collection of cases
n that book seem to me well, worthy of the attention
)f Biologists ; and inasmuch as he, like Professor Richet,
ittributes them to a paranormal extension of purely
luman faculty, without any of what might be called
jupernormal assistance, there may be less than usual in
lis book to repel them by unacceptable and quasi- childish
lypotheses. At any rate Dr. Osty narrates the facts
[rankly, and quotes testimony from some of the clah'-
/oyants themselves as to the way the impressions seem
;o come to them. The result seems to be a body of
jvidence which cannot reasonably be overlooked by men
)f science. Moreover this alone shows, if it were necessary,
jhat Professor Richet is not alone in his cautious attitude
o theory, and rejection of spiritistic views, but is sup-
ported by confreres of similarly great experience.
Prevision does not give me the profound difficulty that
it present it gives Professor Richet. If we have to
nodify our notion of Time, and regard it as more sub-
iective than hitherto—well, we can face even that ; but
it present I do not see the necessity. If any one survives
;here must be many, and some have survived for a long
tsiiime. If there is progress, as they tell us there is—as
doubtedly there must be if survival is a reahty in a
' La Connaissance sv/pra-noiniale Elude experimentale (Paris, 1923).
128 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PARliC]
rational universe,—some will have acquired more knowilome
ledge and power than we at present possess. And, foiit
evidential purposes, it is not impossible that these moreirei
learned individuals may deign to lend assistance. .jde
Scientific inference, even to us, is possible, and physical )f t
prediction can be based upon that. There are manyuaat
kinds of prediction known to vis here and now. A>verj
transit or an echpse is one very simple type. A railway nfor
time-table is another. I can predict that I shall go byjo
the 11.15 to Paris this day fortnight. Competent people^
can predict that Aldebaran will be occulted by the moonoccai
at 4.7 a.m. on the 23rd of August, 1924 ; or that Marsjato
will graze or rather dip under the left-hand top of the
moon, and remain invisible from 8.3 to 8.23 p.m. on the
evening of the 5th of November in this same year. One
class of prediction is based on planning, which we may
or may not carry out, and is contingent upon " strikes."
The other is based upon calculation from present know-
ledge, and is contingent on their being no cometary or
other disturbance to affect the equanimity of the moon.
Predictions are always contmgent, never iixfallible. Yet
one may feel reasonably certain that frost will occur next
winter, and I hope equally certani that France and
England will continue good friends.
To take a small instance. Why am I sure that our
differences of opinion about details of the Universe will
not upset the amicable relations between Richet and
myself ? The answer is. Because we both have characters
of fair stability on which reliance can be placed.
Very well then, a higher being—I do not mean Deity,
for that may go without saying, but people who have
advanced in knowledge, grown in intelligence,—may be
able to infer and plan and predict events, of to us
surjDrising improbability, far ahead. They see further than
we do. They have greater power of ratiocination, they
are better judges of character, and can tell with fair
assurance how even people will behave, as well as, more
easily, what mechanical things will do.
But are we in touch with these exalted intelligences ?
Is it hkely that they take the trouble to come and talk

lomesticities through a medium here ? No, by no means ;
t least we need not look for such condescension. We
ire not in touch with them, but our friends on the other
ide are. They, let us suppose, want to give evidence
)f the reahty of things which are strange to us. They
"ijlvant to wake us up out of our materialistic torpor : so
very now and then our friends are allowed to glean
nformation from some higher being, and to convey it
o us. If Newton or Shakespeare were ahve on the
iarth to-day, even I might be allowed to speak to him
)ccasionally : and if I was talking to ignorant people
'ifterwards, though I could not convey one tithe of what
le might have told me, I might be able to impress a
ioke\ by predicting an eclipse or a comet, or by fore-
:elUng some chain of events that would excite interest
ind astonishment.
So we need not be unduly perturbed at finding that
:hose on the other side possess powers which we do
lot understand. We ourselves possess powers which our
ancestors would have thought miraculous ; and our des-
cendants will smile at the satisfaction with which we view
Dur petty achievements in, say, locomotion and inter-
communication. Prometheus was regarded almost as a
god for discovering fire. Yet any urchin with a box of
matches could set—if not the Thames—at least a Thames
warehouse on fire. It took a Faraday to discover
magneto-electricity ; but every electrical shop sells tele-
phones and dynamos. It needed Maxwell and Hertz to
discover electrical waves ; but now, one can hear Paris
concerts by a thing rigged up in an Enghsh or Scottish
barn. To modify the well-known tag into something
more certainly true : There is nothing eitlier new or
strange but thinking makes it so."

OF THE
Society for Psychical Research
PART XCI.
JULY, 1924
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.
By J. G. PiDDINGTON.
{Delii-ered at a General Meeting of the Society on May 8, 1924.)
i'ORTY-Two years have now gone by since the foundation
)f our Society, and during that time nothing of a sensa-
ional, or even, I think, of an outstanding character has
)ccurred to interrupt the even tenor of its way. Progress,
ndeed, has been made, but it has been a quiet and a
;radual progress. There has been no unexpected develop-
nent such as from time to time cheers investigators in
ither fields : no startUng discovery to attract wide atten-
ion and win instant recognition.
In ordinary circumstances I should not complain of
hat ; nor should I now, were it not that my office obliges
ae to choose some subject on which to address you.
t must often happen that Presidents of other Societies
ievoted to studies that yield quicker and more positive
esults are spared the trouble of casting about for a
ubject for their Addresses, and have one almost thrust
pon them by some new discovery, or tangible advance
ecently made in their own particular science. As I am
ot in that happy position, such observations as I have to
lake will, I fear, be of a rather dull and desultory kind.
132 J. G, Piddington [PAR'' :cl]
I shall not, like my eloquent predecessor, move amon,
the splendours and immensities of the heavens ; nor sha][»ti<
I seek to scale the mountain-heights of thought, but-
of necessity, if not by choice—I shall keep to the low!
and homelier valleys that lie about the base of Psychicalwa
Research.
In speaking of the progress made during the pas^
42 years as slow and hesitating I have no intention c
belittling it, or of suggesting that it is not real. ]
what educated people thought 30 or 40 years ago abou
the phenomena, we investigate be compared with wha
the same class thinks now, no one, I venture to saj
will fail to note a marked change. Almost universe
indifference has given place to a widely-diffused, if mile
interest ; the sniffings and snortings of the robust scepti
who would dismiss the whole subject a iwiori as rubbis
or superstition are at least less frequent and usuaU;
more restrained ; and more than one orthodox psychologis
not merely treats us with respect but has given us hi
blessing. It is not simply a case of hostility and ridicul
giving place to toleration—to a toleration born parti
of easy-going good-nature and partly of boredom ; it
something more than that. The work done by tb
Society has unquestionably brought about a change i ipi
the beliefs of great numbers of educated people. B; le
" educated people " I mean, not svich as can mere!
read and write, but those people, drawn from ever
class of the community, in whom the critical facult
is sufficiently developed to allow them to weigh voluminou
if not highly comphcated, evidence. Among such peop^
40 years ago there can have been but very few wbi|tiKl
beUeved in telepathy ; whereas to-day they must numbflflei
tens of thousands. I do not mean that the majorit|cii
of these persons would be well enough up in the evidend
for telepathy to give detailed reasons for their beli
in it ; and I daresay a large proportion of them assun
it to be a physical process, and are unaware that suc;
evidence as there is points in the opposite directioitl t
Nevertheless, the fact remains that a large number m
educated people nowadays accept telepathy as a factifjij
iay(

jmd it is the evidence collected and published by our
Society that has brought this about.
If belief in clairvoyance has not grown to any thing
ike the same extent, that is largely—perhaps entirely
—
iia jecause the evidence for it is most markedly inferior
n quantity, whatever may be thought of its quality,
)0 the evidence for telepathy : and there can be no
question that quantity tells, and rightly so, I think.
What educated opinion about the so-called " physical
i«)|)henomena " may be I have little or no idea ; but I
luspect it to be much the same as about clairvoyance,
n spite of there being a considerable mass of evidence
effl|-elating to them. At the same time I am being constantly
itruck, and rather bewildered, by the fact that the
'
physical phenomena " command more interest among
nembers of the general public than do the psychical
)henomena. So little conversant am I, however, with the
)hysical phenomena that the less I say about them the
s I »etter ; and henceforward I shall confine myself almost
ntirely to the psychical phenomena.
The estimates I have been attempting of the different
'ffects produced on the educated world by our different
iiinds of evidence are necessarily based on my personal
mpressions only, and may be mistaken ; but if they
tie correct, then there is, I think, a close correspondence
n tetween the effects produced on outsiders and the effects
ift on the minds of those members of the Society who
lave taken an active part in the collection, consideration,
,nd presentment of the evidence.
So far I have not mentioned one type of the phenomena
tudied by the Society : namely, the so-called Spirituahstic
ihenomena. That most of us who have studied these par-
icular phenomena at first hand believe that in many cases
hey are in some degree, though by no means wholly,
ue to the agency of the dead, is clear enough from the
apers we have contributed to the Proceedings ; but
whether this opinion is shared by any considerable section
f the educated public I have no means of ascertaining.
>ut of this much at least I feel confident, that the
vidence on which we rely has had enough effect to

allow the question of communication from and witl
the dead to be debated in a serious spirit and as
serious possibility.
If this be true, and if it be true besides that telepath^^
is to-day accepted as a fact by large numbers of educates
people, then I for one cannot regard this as a meai
and unsatisfactory outcome of 42 years' work.
It may be objected that, though the Society ma^
perhaps deserve the sole credit for convincing man;;!
critical minds of telepathy, it is not entitled to the whol(
credit for bringing about a more favourable attitud
towards the question of communication with the dead
and it may be claimed that part of the credit shoulc
be given to the Spiritualists. This claim I would no'
admit, though ready to allow that they can coun
many converts among the uncritical ; and I would g( i
further and urge that it is the Spiritualists' uncritica
and over-enthusiastic way of dealing with their evidencelw
their failure to distinguish—or if they do, to mark th( sjcl
distinction—between good evidence and weak or worthlesi
evidence, and their reluctance to suspect fraud wher* Bf
to the plain man it is patent or highly probable, thai!f
have been in the past and are to-day responsible fo]
much of the prejudice against the spiritualistic hypothesiil'
s
prevalent among people capable of realising whether oi lost
not a case is being presented with caution, candour
and care.
The effect produced on educated minds by the worl
of the Society has not been confined to a wide-spreacjtai
belief in telepathy or to a greater inclination to consideilo c
in a serious spirit the problem presented by the spirit Bi
ualistic phenomena, but has been felt, as indeed is onljunsi
natural, in philosophy and religion. Few books on eitheilif
subject appear nowadays which fail to take at leasi!
some account of psychical research ; and this is perhaps
all the more gratifying if we consider how natural i1 ave
would have been had the victorious advance of physica. titt
science during recent years so absorbed the attention otii
of the intellectual world that there was none left tc
spare for our unspectacular reconnoitrings in a strange

ffii-nd obscure region. Physical science, indeed, is marching
rora strength to strengtli ; she betrays no symptom of
ecline, but rather every evidence of increasing power
0 grapple with the problems of the material world ;
,nd if her triumphant progress during the past 40 years
aei|»e contrasted with our relatively exiguous record of
uccess, some may feel a sense of discouragement. Yet
do not think discouragement would be justified, and
laijhat for two reasons. In the first place, ours is a young
cience—if the name of " science " may be given to an
y inquiry conducted with an unflinching regard for accuracy
and if in its youth it progresses but slowly, it is only
ml allowing the example of physical science. In the second
lace, we are faced at every point—and, I imagine,
Iways will be—with difliculties which only rarely, or
1 a very mild form, beset workers in the realm of
hysical science. All, or nearly aU, the phenomena we
ivestigate—and here I have in mind chiefly the purely
sychical phenomena, though much of what I am about
D say would hold good of the alleged " physical pheno-
rlia
lena " too—nearly all these phenomena are in themselves
f a perfectly ordinary and commonplace nature. Some-
ody dreams something, or somebody says something,
r somebody writes something. We all do those things,
lost of us every day, unless we happen to be dumb or
literate. I may be told, perhaps, that many of the spoken
r written things we investigate are spoken or written by
person in trance, and that trance is not ordinary or
jrfJjommonplace. That is true ; but our primary object is
isiji
3 discover evidence of supernormal action—by which I
piii
lean something that goes beyond the limits of mere sub-
anscious action, however strange— ; and in our search for
itlj
ddence of supernormal action, as thus defined, the condi-
on of the speaker or writer is of no importance. If every-
ling that Mrs. Piper, or Mrs. Thompson, or Mi's. Leonard
ave said or written when entranced, had been said or
ixitten while they were wide awake and in a perfectly
prmal condition, its value as evidence of supernormal
3tivity would not be afliected one way or the other,
ere ls nothing, then in the phenomena which in itseK

compels conviction of its supernormal character ; and it
is just this ordinariness of the phenomena that gives
fraud, whether conscious or subliminal, its chance. In
physical science fraud of either kind is practically a
negligible possibility, and even if fraud were practised
it could be readily detected. In our case, it would, I
think, be true to say that we can never put our fingei
on a single phenomenon and unhesitatingly and con-
fidently pronounce it to be supernormal ; we can never
say " this is a certain instance of telepathy," or "of
clairvoyance " ; we can never say " fraud, or chance,:
or misdescription will not suffice to explain this particular
occurrence." Even if the laws governing telepathic oi
clairvoyant action were to be discovered, we should
not, so far as I can see, be any better able to attain
to certainty in any given instance, so long as super-'
normal phenomena remain so easily simulable as they itof
are at present. At best we can attain only to a reason-
able degree of certainty : not to that degree of cer-
tainty which is so often within the reach of physicallrt
science.
There appeared in the Journal for December last aniKj
account of a case of smgular interest, especially from ffti
the point of view of theory. In bare outhne the reported
facts were these : A Dutch boy of 15 has been watchingi
from his window some people entering a house opposite,iffld
for the purpose of having a seance, and has been feeling ;liop(
vexed at not being able to take part in the seance |ip
himself. He then gets hold of an old school-book con-| Tl
taining an Enghsh poem, and sits down and reads theijtbs
poem in a dreamy state, without, however, apparently 'iptei
any other design than that of whihng the time away.iom
Whilst the boy is dozing over the poem, two out of j-tl
the five stanzas of which it consists—the only ones thejjkt
boy knew by heart—are reproduced at the seance, thejttiai
i-eproduction being preceded by the manifestation of a
control " who gives no name, announces in Enghsh
that he is going to write a song, answers in English
questions put in Dutch, and states that he is an English-
man. Siiaeci
m CI.] Presidential Address 137
1 i If all the facts reported are true, they are obviously
:iv6 uportant from the theoretic point of view. But
1 /hat kind of certainty can one feel as to the alleged
i' i upernormal elements in this case 1 What odds would
sel ou lay on their being genuine ? Would you lay
[ 1 000 to 1 in £'s sterling that there wasn't trickery,
19? r collusion, or misdescription, or some other normal
a iause at work ? I can't answer for others, but my
;vij ,nswer would be an emphatic " No " : though^ I
"i aight be prepared to lay 3 to 1 against a normal ex-
DfE Sanation being the true one. But how flimsy a kind
nlai I'f certainty this represents as compared with the kind
9 if certainty that physical science may afford. Imagine
hat the Astronomer Royal v/ere invited, or dared, to
tai vager £5000 to £1 that the next eclipse of the moon
pel Fould occur at the time predicted by Greenwich, or
liei whoever it is that works out these things. Well, he
m aight suffer from a Nonconformist conscience, or he
cci night hold that there's no fun in betting on a certainty ;
is )ut at any rate it would not be fear of losing his money
hat would deter him from laying the odds. These two
J maginary wagers will serve to illustrate the kind of
01
tertainty that physical science frequently—though by no
I neans invariably—attains, and the uncertainty that dogs
Jl our efforts ; and so long as that uncertainty exists—
•
md it may well be that it will always exist—we cannot
lope to approach, let alone to rival, the rate of progress
)f physical science.
This perpetual want of cut-and-dried-ness, this un-
lubstantialit}/ and instability that characterise all our
phenomena, may well be one of the causes that render
)ur investigations distasteful to so many men of science
—though fortunately not to all. And not only that,
Dut the comparative immunity from such uncertainty
ihat men of science enjoy may disqualify them from
Deing, as they might on first thoughts be supposed to
iijioe, the best judges of our work. Frederic Myers, it
Ms true, often expressed himself as tliough the filial court
»Df appeal before which our case would be heard would
aecessarily be composed of men of science ; and our
138 J. 0. Piddington [PAM
first President in his first Presidential Address spoke as
follows :
" If anyone asks me what I mean by, or how I define,
sufficient scientific proof of thought-reading, clairvoyance,
or the phenomena called spiritualistic, I should ask to be
allowed to evade the difficulties of determining in the
abstract what constitutes adequate evidence. What I
mean by sufficient evidence is evidence that will convince
the scientific world."
I might have hesitated to express dissent from the
opinions of two such authorities, had I not chanced to
re-read Professor Henri Bergson's Presidential Address
to this Society, and gathered from it, though he does
not say so in so many words, that he takes the view
which I am here putting forward. Training in physical
science and the pursuit of it, as it seems to me, do
not necessarily make a man a better critic of the evidence
collected by this Society than do some other forms of
education and employment. A man of science might
be as good a critic as others, or even a better one ;
but in that event he would be so, not qmi man of science,
but because he happened to possess qualifications which
his own avocation is not specially calculated to develop.
Men of science are not, so far as I know, specially expert
in assessing the value of human testimony ; nor are
they specially expert—perhaps rather the contrary—in
literary matters, and it so happens that quite a con-
siderable portion of our evidence can hardly be appreciated
at its true value without some scholarly and literary
msight. And though men of science deal with men's
bodies, alive or dead, they have little experience in
dealing with the manifestations, and particularly with
the abnormal manifestations, of men's minds.
"
Unlike
ourselves, moreover, it is but very rarely indeed that men
of science have to beware of fraud, conscious or sub-
liminal ;
and if they have to make allowance for the
personal equation of experimenters or observers, that
allowance, owing to various causes, presents little difficulty;
whereas against that possible and frequent source of
XCI.] Presidential Address 139
error we with difficulty have to guard ourselves in every
department of our enquiries ; and in addition we have
always to be making allowance for the personal equation
of the dreamer, of the percipient, of the automatist,
and of the corroborating witnesses.
I do not, then, believe that official science is our
proper court of appeal ; and I do not know of any
formal body which could assume that function with
authority. Neither medicine, nor law, nor history, nor
literature, though each might contribute some of the
necessary qualifications, could fill the bill ; and not even
a committee of intelligent schoolboys, though it might
possess some useful qualifications in which physicians,
lawyers, historians, men of letters, and even men of
science might be deficient. It is, I beheve, only among
what for want of an exacter definition I have called
" educated people " that a competent tribunal will be
ultimately found. It is they who will pass final judge-
ment ; and it is therefore their interest that we should
specially try to win ; and we should not be downhearted
if men of science as a body look askance at our work ;
and if so far only five Fellows and two Presidents of
the Royal Society have presided over our Society.
I pass on now to make some observations on the
organisation through which our researches have been
carried on. A large part—I think I may say, a very
lai'ge part—of the Society's research has been done by
a small number of its members, of whom most are friends
or acquaintances of each other. This small number of
individuals might have co-operated as a private group
without a Society behind them, but to have done so
would have involved at least two drawbacks. They
would have found it much harder to form a considerable
circle of readers, and to maintain it if formed ; and they
would consequently have made less headway in attracting
the attention of that very class of educated people which,
if my view is sound, will some day pass judgement on the
investigation. Secondly, without a Society behind them,
it is unlikely that any small group of workers would
have been able by their own unaided activities to come
140 J. G. Piddington [part
often enough into contact with what I venture to call
the raw material, or corpora vilia, necessary for the
prosecution of their researches. The existence of a
Society made it possible to carry out the Census of
Hallucinations—a work of great importance—on a scale
large enough to provide a dependable basis for calcula-
tion ; and it is among the members of our Society
that some of the best automatists and telepathic per-
cipients have been found : Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Salter,
Mrs. Stuart Wilson, Mrs. Home, Mrs. " Forbes," Mrs.
Lyttelton, Miss Ramsden and others ; and if I do not
add the name of Professor Gilbert Murray, it is for
fear of his protesting that lie is but a mere hyper-
aesthetic, innocent of all telepathic faculty.
In thus being largely self-supporting, and dependent
for its raw material only to a limited extent on imports
from abroad, our Society, perhaps, differs from all other
scientific bodies ; for even if some of the medical and
psychological societies draw on their members for subjects
of experiment and observation, I am sure they do not
do so to anythmg like the same extent. To those of
our members who have lent themselves so unselfishly
and docilely to experimentation and observation—some-
times prolonged and very tedious—our sincerest thanks
are due ; and are due, if for no other reason at least
for this, that it is their collaboration which has saved
us from the awkward necessity of relying for a large
and important part of our evidence on professional
subjects.
Yet while the institution of a Society has brought
these and other advantages with it, I would not deny
that it has entailed, or may entail, some drawbacks
and disappointments. Let me begin with the disappoint-
ments : two in number. The first is the relatively small
number of members who have been willing, not now
and again and for a short period, but systematically
and regularly, to work at our subject. When we con-
sider the number of highly-educated people with private
means in this country, and how many of them under-
take work of a public character without remuneration,
XCI.] Presidential Address 141
and how many of such people there must be in the
ranks of our members, we may naturally feel disappointed
that so few have devoted themselves to Psychical Research.
The second disappointment is the faUing-off of recent years
in the number of cases contributed by our members.
Members would no doubt excuse their inactivity on various
grounds ;
but, short of there being no cases to report,
no excuse is valid in face of the need, the ever-present
need, of fresh evidence. On this head I have to enlarge
at some length.
One reason why it is highly desirable to keep up a
constantly fresh supply of evidence is the need for mere
accumulation, quantity of evidence being of prime impor-
tance where crucial tests and cases are not be had.
A second reason is that our sort of evidence has a
tendency to lose its value and effect as it grows old.
A case, even if contemporaneously and carefully recorded,
that dates back 20, 30, or 40 years, is apt to produce
less effect on our mmds than a well-recorded case of
recent date. Why this should be so I am by no means
clear ; and no doubt the tendency to feel a lessened
confidence in old evidence is not entirely rational. Yet
it is not entirely irrational, for in the case of old evidence
we must always have the feeling that the chances are
against our being able to clear up doubtful points by
cross-examining the witnesses, either because they are
no longer alive, or, because if tlxey do survive, their
recollections after so long a lapse of time would not be
worth much. I have purposely not spoken of cases
that go back more than forty years because that would
have included evidence collected in the Dark Ages before
the foundation of this Society, and much of that evidence
would be open to the suspicion of having been recorded
and collected by people who were not fully alive to
all the sources of error. I am speaking of our own
evidence only, which m spite of its high quahty tends
to decrease in value as time goes on. I would ask
you to consider what effect our evidence would be likely
to have upon mankind 200 years hence, if for some
reason or other aU work on and interest in the subject
142 J. G. Piddington [part
suddenly came to a full .stop to-morrow, and all existing
records of psychical phenomena were utterly lost sight
of until by a happy accident in the year 2124 a com-
plete set of S.P.R. Proceedings was discovered and
attracted the attention of a group of thinkers like the
group that founded our Society. These men would, I
fancy, not fail to recognise that they had Lighted on a
body of first-class evidence collected with every proper
care and analysed with critical acumen, which prejudice
alone could ignore. But would they accept the evidence
as it stood ? I very much doubt it. I think they
would say :
" This evidence is too old ; it's 200 years
old ; and before we accept it, we must see whether
our own investigations and experiences will corroborate
it." In the same way our past evidence will with every
decade or so lose some of its cogency with the new
generation unless it is being constantly reinforced by
new evidence. Yet, notwithstanding that I take this
view of our sort of evidence, I should presume that
evidence given, say, in a trial for murder 200 years
ago would be worth as much now as then, if fully and
carefully recorded. How, then, should I explain the
enduring worth of the evidence in the one case and
its diminishing worth in the other 1 I should hesitate
to assert, but I would venture to suggest that the differ-
ence would be due to the fact that in the one case we
are absolutely certain that murder is committed, even
if we have never seen a murder committed or com-
mitted one ourselves ; while none of us is quite so
absolutely certain, and most people are far less certain,
that anything " supernormal " ever occurs. Will it, then,
be always necessary to go on collecting fresh evidence ?
And if we don't, will the effect of all the evidence so
far collected gradually disappear in course of time ?
Once more I would not like to attempt a dogmatic
answer ; ])ut I should anticipate that it will l)e necessary
to hammer away at the task of renewing the evidence
until supernormal phenomena come to be believed in
nearly as readily as, say, murder ;
until, in fact, a habit
of belief in them has become general.
XCI.] Presidential Address 143
While I am on this subject of deterioration in the
value of evidence through lapse of time, I should Hke
to touch on the effect on it of distance, especially where
distance involves difference of nationality, although to
do so involves a digression. I find in my own case
that as a general ride I do not attach the same weight
to the evidence of foreigners, even of Americans, as to
the evidence of my own countrymen ; and having no
reason .to think that I am singular in this respect, I
assume the impression to be a common one. At first
sight this may appear like mere insular prejudice ; but
I think it is really nothing of the kind, and that the
feeling has a rational basis. For it is not based on
distrust of foreigners, but on distrust of my own ability
to estimate the value of evidence given by foreigners.
When trying to make up one's mind what amoimt of
trust to repose in the testimony of a fellow-countryman,
one's judgement is influenced, conscioiisly and unconsciously,
by innumerable little impalpable imponderable indications ;
and I feel sure that in the main such indications do
really help towards the formation of a correct conclusion.
But with witnesses of foreign nationality one is all at
sea in this respect. If you question this, imagme to
3'^ourselves an Enghshman being tried in this country
on a criminal charge before a jury, not of his own country-
men, but—by some Gilbertian freak—of Italians perfectly
familiar with colloquial English but with no experience
of English life ; and then imagine this jury trying to
assess the value of evidence given by the following English
witnesses ; an archdeacon, a laundryman, an official of
the Post Office, a lodging-house keeper, a veterinary
surgeon, a lady's-maid, an Oxford don, a poKce-constable
and a West-end tailor. How they would flounder
!
When we try to form an opinion of cases in which
the evidence comes from foreigners, our task is akin
to the one I have imposed on my hypothetical Italian
jury. And, reciprocally, if foreigners do not feel towards
our evidence what I feel towards theirs, I think they
ought to.
The extreme difficulty of making the evidence in such
144 J. G. Piddmgton [part X(
matters as we investigate equally valid for other nation- it
alities makes me sceptical of the utility of international ei
co-operation in psychical research ; and inclines me to ti
think that if a nation desires to learn the truth about a
psychical phenomena it must to a very large extent work 1)'
out its own salvation. 8
After this long digression you may well have forgotten 1)
where I was when I started upon it. I had been men- If
tioning two disappomting features in the history of the »
Society : namely, the small number of members who o
have systematically devoted themselves to psychical a
research, and the falling-off in recent years in the number -
of cases contributed by members. i
I turn now to speak of certain drawbacks which our t
existence as a Society has entailed, or may entail. ,
s
The first and most obvious one is that the work of t
running a Society with a membership as large as ours f
means the expenditure of a good deal of time and energy i
that might otherwise be spent on investigation ; for it '
\
so happens that those who have borne a large share i
of the research work have also borne a large share in i
the management of the business affairs of the Society. (
Why not divide the labour, it may be asked, and so ]
relieve the investigators from mere routine work ? '
Theoretically that sounds plausible ; but I doubt whether 1
it would work well in practice. It is right that those i
who have the most extensive first-hand experience of ;
the phenomena that the Society was formed to investigate
should also have a controlling voice in the direction of
its policy, and questions of policy are too closely bound
up with the business side of the organisation for the ]
two to be under separate management.
A second, and more serious, drawback that our existence
as a corporate body entails is the risk of the control
of the Society passing into the hands of a section of
its members, who would be hkely to lower the severely
critical standard that has so far been maintained—and
mamtained sometimes in the face of considerable dis-
satisfaction. It is not easy to find a name for this
section, whose existence, in spite of its not being organised,
I
XCI.] Presidential Address 145
it would be idle to deny. I would not call it the
credulous section, for, apart from the offence that that
title would probably give, I do not think that, exceptis
excipiendis, they are credulous as a body. They doubtless
believe some things that most members of the Royal
Society in common with the man in the street do not
beheve ; but that is no criterion of credulity ;| or at
least I hope it isn't, for if it is, I am "of all men
most miserable." Sir OHver Lodge on one occasion
—
or so I believe, though I have failed to trace the reference,
and so if I am misrepresenting him, I ask his forgiveness
—Sir Oliver once divided the members of this Society
into a Bight and a Left Wing. The Right comprised
those of cautious and conservative views who uphold the
strictest methods of investigation ; the Left comprised
those who beheve more than the Right think is good
for them, who desire to join hands with or to enter
into closer touch mth professed Spiritualists and to
propagate their faith in partibus infidelium with a mission-
ary zeal distasteful to the Right, and who would not
view with alarm some relaxation in the rigorous methods
of investigation hitherto pursued. But to christen the
particular section I am seeking to define " the Left
Wing " would be misleading ; for though it doubtless
belongs to the Left, it is quite possible, as I know from
my own case, to belong to the Left in matters of belief,
and yet to adhere to the Bight—even to the Extreme
Bight—in respect of all that concerns methods of investi-
gation. For my immediate purpose, then, Sir Oliver's
dichotomy will not serve ; and to bring out what it
is that separates the particular section of members of
whom I am speaking from those opposed to them, I
shall call the latter the High-and-Dry School and the
former—since the obvious antithesis might be actionable
—^the Not-High-and-Dry School. The dividing line here
has nothing to do with how much or how little of the
phenomena under investigation one accepts as supernormal,
and concerns only opinions as to methods of investigation
and standards of evidence. The Not-High-and-Dries, if
I do not misrepresent them, take the line that so much
14fi J. n. Pifldinqfon [par\
has been established be3^ond cavil that we can now
safely relax to some extent the stringent precautions and
the very high standard of evidence on which the Society
has hitherto insisted, and generally adopt a less suspicious
and more genial attitude towards mediums, automatists,
dreamers of dreams, seers of apparitions, corroborating
witnesses and so forth. ,
The High-and-Dries take the
line that we cannot now, or for a long time to come,
and probably ever, afford to lower our " evidential
"
standard, or modify our methods—our admittedly irritating
and meticulously wary methods—of investigation. Well,
I for one am whole-heartedly on the side—I will not
say, of the Angels, but—of the High-and-Dries ; and
that there exists a school of opposite views is due, I
cannot but suspect, to a failure to realise—to realise
not momentarily but always and vividly—one dominant
characteristic of all, or very nearly all, the phenomena
we investigate : I mean their easy simulalnlity. For
genuine supernormal phenomena can be aped in various
ways : by dehberate fraud, by subliminal fraud, and by
fraud that hovers between these two ;
and, furthermore,
a semblance of them may be created by faulty memory,
by careless recording, or by chance. Had the labours
of the S.P.R. resulted in the accumulation of good
evidence for witches riding through the air on broom-
sticks, or for repeated correct predictions in minute
detail of events apparently beyond the powers of ordinary
foresight and inference ; if , in a word, there had been
placed on record a mass of good evidence for the occur-
rence of things simulable only by extraordinary and costly
mechanical devices, or not simulalile by any known
normal agencies, then there might have been something
to say for the policy of less stringency. But there is
no such evidence, none for witches riding on broomsticks
or similar marvels ; and unless and until there is good
evidence—not an occasional scrap, but a mass of it
—
for phenomena outside the range of easy simulation,
there is only one safe and sane policy, and that is to
maintain our High-and-Dry methods and standards. In
a trance-sitting, of which I have seen the record, Frederic
paeI'^'^^"^
Presidential Address 147
JVtyers is represented as commenting disapprovingly on
an unpublished piece of investigation recently carried out.
Whether IMyers was really in any Avay concerned is, of
coui-se, open to question; but the plu-ase with which the
soi-disant Myers brought liis critical remarks to an end
was at least true to life: "No sloppy work, please"; and
if I quote it at this point it is not because I think the
Not-High-and-Dries like sloppy work, but because I
believe that if our standards were to be lowered, sloppv
work would be the inevitable result.
I have to deal with only one other disadvantage that
may arise from investigation being conducted through
the agency of a Society, and then I have almost done.
It IS obvious that a membership such as ours must
include a large number of persons whose interest in
psychical research is not that of the expert, Init rather
that of the amateur ; and. again, a considerable number
whose interest m the subject is emotional rather than
intellectual. I hope I may say this without giving
offence, and that for two reasons : one being that I
think it is a good thing that it should be so; the other,
that I am myself a member of other Societies with whose
objects I feel sjanpathy, but whose work I am either
unable to follow, or can follow only in a very amateurish
way. Now, if our Society is composed largely of members
of these types, there must always be a risk of then?
severing then- connexion with it should they find our papers
difficult to follow, or should they fail to obtain satisfaction
for their emotional requirements ; or else a risk of their
bringing such pressure to bear that genuinely scientific Avork
will be sacrificed for the sake of making our Proceedings'
more popular and attractive. Experience shows that all
sciences, simple enough in their infancy, increase in
complexity as they grow older. Take, for example,
the simple experiments undertaken in the early days
of the Royal Society by men with little or no
specialised training and easily followed by anyone of
decent intelligence, and compare the reports of them
with the Transactions and Proceedings of that Society
to-day. These pubhcations, I have heard it whispered,
148 J. G. Piddington [part
contain many papers so abstruse as to be unintelligible
to the majority of Fellows and digestible by only a very
few experts in the particular branch of science of which
they treat. Now imagine for a moment that as soon
as physical science had begun to make progress, and as
a consequence had begun to be split up into different
specialised departments, and the Transactions as a further
consequence had become increasingly difficult to under-
stand,—imagine, I say, that the lay members of the
Royal Society had objected on the ground that though,
of course, they weren't asking for light reading, they
really did think that these recent papers were too stiff.
Suppose further that thek protest had met with such
success from a sympathetic but weak Council that thence-
forward only records of experiments and observations
which the average layman could follow without taxing
his brains had received official publication—well, if that
had happened, what would be the position of physical
science in this country to-day ? Luckily for science
and for the Royal Society no such catastrophe as I
have asked you to imagine overtook it ; and I hope
that such a catastrophe may never debilitate or destroy
our Society. But if, like other sciences, psychical research
increases in complexity, I can well imagine that the
result might be either a very serious, even fatal loss
of interest and consequently of members, and consequently
of income ;
or, still worse, surrender to a demand for
publications of a more popular kind :
—a surrender that
might, indeed, preserve the Society, but which would
destroy its real utility. For what would it profit to
save the Society and to forfeit the end to which the
Society is but a means ? It might, indeed, matter
little, if there were in this country other bodies ready
and competent to perform what I conceive to be our
special duty ; and that is to investigate certain obscure
phenomena, and to carry on that investigation not for
the sake of entertaining people, or with a view to con-
verting people to any particular articles of faith, but
simply and solely in the hope of discovering the true
facts. Though various other organisations exist for the
,Oji
true
xci.] Presidential Address 149
study of psychical phenomena, they seem to me to
approach the subject with a definifce parti pris : and I
know of no other body actuated solely by scientific
curiosity and with a set determination to follow the
evidence wheresoever it may lead, that could take our
place, were we to prove false to our trust ; and that is
why I am a little apprehensive lest, as our subject becomes
more complex, we should either suffer so large a loss
of members as to cripple our activities, or—what would
be much worse—cater for popularity by neglecting the
investigation or cold-shouldering the presentment of the
more involved phenomena. And, as I have already said,
as the enquiry proceeds, unless Psychical Research is
to prove an exception to the general rule, the subject
is bound to become more complex. Indeed, it has become
so already, partly from the mere accumulation of material ;
but also from another cause. I have pointed out before
—and I do not apologise for doing so again, because
the thing deserves attention—that up to the time of
Frederic Myers's death in January, 1901, the phenomena
recorded in our Proceedings were, to speak broadly and
roughly, of a simple and straightforward type. Within
a few weeks of his death a change takes place, though
it is not realised—at least not fully realised—till much
ater. I am not speaking at this moment of what are
sailed cross-correspondences, for that development came
ater, but of Mrs. Verrall's scripts. I cannot go into
ietail now, but speaking briefly I may say that these
jcripts mark a new departure in so far as they exhibit
^reat complexity of structure, each several script forming
I minute piece of a most elaborate and extensive mosaic,
ihe pattern of which cannot be traced until all the
ittle pieces are put together in accordance with subtle
ndications furnished in the scripts themselves. Then,
n 1903, with the advent on the scene of Mrs. Holland,
I further complication ensues. Her script, which is of
•he same tessellated character as Mrs. Verrall's, exhibits,
iS was soon recognised, coincidences with Mrs. Verrall's
ar beyond what chance will account for. Then in rapid
uccession other automatic writers mingle in the game :
150 J. G. Piddingfon [pa.rt M.
So
Mrs. Salter, the Macs., Mrs. Willett, Mrs. Stuart Wilson,
and Mrs. Lyttelton. The scripts of all these automatists,
too, show just the same complexity of structure as Mrs.
Verrall's and Mrs. Holland's ; and embedded in them
all is a very galaxy of cross-correspondences. Of these
cross-correspondences so far only a comparatively few
specimens have been published ; and yet enough, I think,
to convince a careful student of them, even if the utmost
allowance be made for chance coincidence and ingenuity
of interpretation, that there are purpose and intelligent
direction at work.
So, then, we have not had long to wait for psychical
research to follow the example of other sciences and be-
come more and more complex. It has already become
so, and become so not only from mere accumulation of I
to
material and from the growth of literature on the subject, it
but from the greater complexity of the phenomena them-
selves. And here incidentally I would call your attention
to the fact that this greater complexity arises from
someone's intelligent design. I am not troubling about
the question of what intelligence or intelligences are
responsible for the design. Assume, if you will, the
design and the carrying out of it to be the work of
an unknown living person ; or assume them to be the
work of more than one of the automatists themselves
—I say " more than one," because for various reasons a
they cannot possibly be entirely the work of one only 1
of the automatists ; or assume them to be the work I nil
of discarnate intelligences ; the fact, or so I hold, remains it
that some intelligence is deliberately complicating some !
1
of the phenomena which this Society investigates. If j
that be true, we are faced with a difficulty peculiar, I
I believe, to our own field of research, and certainly
unknown to physical science. For though physical science
has to deal with immensely complex problems, it never
has to assume that its problems are being intentionally
complicated for it by some designing Demiurge. Our
Demiurge may have the best of motives, and may
introduce his complexities, not in order to bewilder us,
but for the purpose of rendering the phenomena as
tre;
eei
XCI.] Presidential Address 151
difficult as possible to explain by telepathy inter vivos,
or for other reasons ; but however excellent his intentions,
there is no escaping from the fact that the increased
complexity has increased the difficulty of presenting the
evidence in a form palatable to the average member,
who naturally cannot be expected to give the same
minute attention to the problems involved as the in-
vestigators. And yet without minute attention these
complicated phenomena cannot be properly understood.
So far our members have shown a laudable long-sufferance,
and if I have ventured to voice a doubt of its con-
tinuance, it is because I realise to the full how large
is the draft Ave have made upon it. But such of us
as have been guilty of contributing papers about these
complex phenomena to the Proceedings may in one respect
at least claim the gratitude of our readers ; for we have
not, as we easily might have, inflicted on them the labour
of making themselves acquainted with a lot of new-
fangled technical terms. When I come across some of
the monstrosities of this kmd that disfigure the writings
of modern psychologists, and especially of those who
treat of psycho-analysis, I admit that I am seized with
the spirit of the Pharisee, and thank God that we are
not as other men are.
On reading over what I had written thus far, with
a view to seeing how to bring this address to a close,
I was reminded of a remark made to me by a friend
who happened to know that I was engaged upon wTiting
it. "Don't be too depressing," she said. Holding, as
I do, that results of a far-reaching and inspiriting kind
have been attained through the labours of the S.P.R.,
I certamly did not set out with the intention of producing
a depressing effect ; and I hope I have not produced
one unwittingly. Yet, at the same time, I confess that
I should not be sorry if anything I have said should
help to check exaggerated notions of the degree of
certainty attained and attainable in such researches as
ours. There seems to me to be a growing risk of belief
outrunnmg the evidence, and too Kttle reahsation—at
any rate among the public—of the patience and care
152 J. 0. Piddington [part
required to discriminate phenomena in appearance super-
normal but in reality of normal origin from genuine
supernormal phenomena. How ready and eager many
are to seek after signs, and how utterly uncritical in
their search, no unprejudiced observer, alive to what
has been going on around him during the past 10 years
of crisis, can surely deny. Credulity and superstition,
two of the greatest evils that afflict mankind, are plants
of rapid growth ; and when sooner or later the day
comes—as come, I firmly believe, it will—when com-
munication between the dead and the living has become
part—rightly become part—of the accepted beliefs of
mankind, there will ensue, I greatly fear, a period in
which these two evils will flourish ; and the general
public, incapable of making fine distinctions, will swallow
genuine, ambiguous, illusory and fraudu.lent phenomena
with equal avidity. I do not, of course, flatter myself
that any words of mine could directly serve to prevent
or counteract so unfortunate a state of things—and one,
moreover, calculated to bring unmerited contempt upon
the whole subject. To do that, one would have to
have the ear of the public. But the danger, I believe,
is a real one, and I should feel I have not wasted breath
if what I have said to-day should bring home to members
how desirable it is that they as individuals, and this
Society as a body, should set an example of level-
headedness and discrimination to the public. " II ny a
de verite que dans les nuances.'' If we could once impress
on the public mind how profoundly true is that aphorism
of Benjamin Constant's in respect of the things we
investigate, we should be rid of the risk of our work
being discredited at some future time in consequence of
popidar outbreaks of undiscriminating credulity. Our
cause, indeed, stands to lose more through the credulity
of the crowd, than through its indifference or its
scepticism.

ELUCIDATION OF TWO POINTS IN THE
" ONE-HORSE DAWN SCRIPTS."
I. thp: herb moly.
By W. H. Salter.
If the " One-Horse Dawn Experiment " were of less
interest to students of Psychical Research, I should feel
that some apology was necessary for recurring to so
ancient a topic. Happening, however, recently to have
stumbled on a fact which seems to throw light on an
important script of Mrs. Verrall, which has never been
satisfactorily explained, I have ventured to contribute this
note to a discussion which cannot be regarded as closed
so long as the smallest dark corner remains unexplored.
For full details of the experiment I must refer the
reader to Mrs. Verrall's paper {Proc, Vol. XX.) and to
Mr. Piddington's comments {Proc, Vol. XXX., pp. 175-229
and 296-305), but the following short summary may be of
assistance.
In April 1901 Dr. Verrall attempted to transmit tele-
pathically to Mrs. Verrall three Greek words (moioVwAoc e?
'Aw) from the Orestes of Euripides, mth a view to their
influencing her automatic scripts. Between this date and
October 1902, when the nature of the experiment was dis-
closed to her by Dr. Verrall, Mrs. Verrall wrote a large
number of scripts containing apparent attempts to repro-
duce either the sound or the sense of these three words.
The scripts of this period also contained numerous allu-
sions, (1) to Dr. Benson and Welhngton College, where
Dr. Verrall had been at school under Dr. Benson and
where the lifelong friendship between them began ; and
(2) to a blind old man, journeying alone and dressed in
154 W. H. Salter [part
white robes, whose identity is the main subject of Mr.
Piddington's papers in Proc, Vol. XXX.
The particular script to which I wish to refer is that of
the 9th September, 1901, which contained the following
words :
—
Find the herb moly that will help—it is a guide
(I'jTii. i<al Tt/Vos- A/yi^e(s (
= seek and in the end you will
understand).
The words '
herb jnoly '
were written larger than the rest
of the script.
When, at the close of the experiment, Dr. and Mrs.
Verrall went over the scripts together, they noticed several
attempts to reproduce the sound of /jlovottwXov (monopolon),
and considered that '
moly '
was a not very successful
specimen of this class. They were, however," puzzled by
the fact that more emphasis seemed to be laid by the
scripts on '
herb moly '
than on other similar attempts at
assonance. They considered, and, I think, there can be
no doubt, rightly, that a reference was intended to the
passage in Milton's Comus, where the Attendant Spirit
gives to the two brothers the magic herb haemony. The
passage (11. 623-637) runs as follows
He [i.e. '
a certain shepherd lad '] loved me well and oft
would hear me sing
Which, when I did, he on the tender grass
Would sit, and hearken even to ecstasy,
And in requital ope his leathern scrip,
And show me simjiles of a thousand names,
Telling their strange and vigorous faculties.
Amongst the rest a small unsightly root
But of divine effect, he culled me out.
The leaf was darkish, and had prickles on it.
But in another country, as lie said,
Bore a bright golden flower, but not in this soil.
Unknown and like esteemed, and the dull swain
Treads on it daily M'ith his clouted shoon :
And yet more med'cinal is it than that moly
That Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave.
)Ir.

XCI.] " One-Horm Dawn Scripts " 155
It will be remembered that in the Odyssey (X. 281-306)
Hermes gives the herb moly to Odysseus (Ulysses) as a
counter-charm against the spells of Circe, just as in
Milton's poem the Attendant Spirit gives the herb haemony
to the two brothers as a counter-charm against the spells
of Circe's son, Comus. But what was the connection
between the passage from Comas and the passage from
the Orestes ?
When Dr. Verrall sat for the Classical Tripos in 1873,
one of the papers, as he remembered, had included the
Orestes passage. After she had been told all about the
experiment, Mrs. Verrall looked through the other papers
set for the same examination, and discovered the curious
fact, which Dr. Verrall had, consciously at any rate, quite
forgotten, that the Comus passage had been set for trans-
lation into Latin verse. Mrs. Verrall in her paper iia
Proc, Vol. XX. (p. 164), expressed the view that the
script registered not only an existing mental impression of
her husband's, but also a forgotten past impression, once
closely associated with the first. This view is not accepted
by Mr. Piddington {Proc, Vol. XXX., pp. 225-228), partly
on the ground that the opportunities for chance-coincidence
in papers set in a Classical Tripos examination are ex-
ceedingly wide. It would not be relevant to the purpose
of this note to express any opinion as to which of these
two views is justified.
Recently, however, I chanced upon another association
of the Comus passage, which links it very closely with
Euripides, Dr. Verrall, Mrs. Verrall, Dr. Benson, Welhngton
College, and also, though the connection in this last case is
not quite as clear, with the blind Old Man in White.
In 1881 Dr. Verrall pubhshed his first book, an edition
of the Medea of Euripides. He was at the time engaged
to Mrs. Verrall, to whom he presented a copy now in my
wife's possession. This copy has on the fly-leaf in Dr.
Verrall's handwriting, " if. de G. if.," the initials of Mrs.
Verrall' s maiden name, and on the page opposite, above
his own initials, A. W. V., a line from the play which is
evidently intended by him as a chaffing allusion to their
engagement. The book is dedicated " To the Right
1
156 W. H. Salter [part
Reverend Edward White Benson, D.D., Lord Bishop of
Truro and formerly Head Master of WelUngton College."
In the Introduction (pp. viii to xi) Dr. Verrall discusses
the various ways in which classical texts become corrupted,
and the principles which he considers should be applied in
restoring them. He illustrates his argument by supposing
that Milton's Covins had been " preserved in manuscript
copies only, made by ill-educated persons, and that we
have to ascertain from five such copies . . . the description
of the magic haemony." He then proceeds to take the
two lines :
—
Unknown and like esteemed : and the duU swain
Treads on it daily with his clouted shoon,
and supposes that one group of manuscripts, while pre-
serving the sense, has departed from the exact form of
the words, and that the other, while keeping closer to the
sound of the original, has degenerated into sheer nonsense.
Finally he shows how by comparing the different per-
versions of the manuscripts in detail, it would be possible
to restore, with a fair degree of certainty, the original
text.
Here then we have a play of Euripides, the aixthor from
whom the subject of the experiment was drawn, edited as
his first published work by Dr. Verrall, the agent in the
experiment, presented by him to Mrs. Verrall, the per-
cipient, on a memorable occasion, and dedicated to Dr.
Benson, formerly Head Master of Wellington, to whom
and to whose former school the scripts have made frequent
references ; and in the Introduction we find that this
particidar passage of Conius is discussed at considerable
length. These correspondences taken together seem to me
to go far beyond the possibilities of chance-coincidence.
Mr. Piddington has reminded me of a later script of
Mrs. Verrall's, written during the course of the experiment,
which is also, I think, designed to draw attention to Dr.
Verrall' s edition of the Medea. 1 mean the script of the
21st June, 1902, printed on pp. 425, 426 of Proc, Vol. XX.
The relevant part of the script for the present purpose is
as follows :
—" Not Luria but Lyssa gives the keynote, he
I
XCI.] " One-Horse Dawn Scripts " 157
must complete. It is better than the Editing—more full
of life—more a thing for men."
The script was recognised by Mrs. Verrall as having
Dr. Benson for the ostensible communicator, and as
referrmg by the words " Luria " and " Lyssa " to an
Essay on Euripides' Hercules Furens on which Dr. Verrall
was then engaged. For the sake of brevity I would refer
the reader to ]\Irs. Verrairs own comments on pp. 1-iO,
141 and 302 of Proc, Vol. XX. The " he " of the script
is, of course, Dr. Verrall.
Now the script clearly draws a distinction between the
nature of the work which Dr. Verrall was then doing, and
" the Editing," and the point of the distinction is this.
Dr. Verrall edited two plays of Euripides {Medea and Ion)
and four of Aeschylus, and achieved a high reputation by
the brilliance of his textual criticism. But his most dis-
tinctive work was as an interpreter of these authors. In
particular he propounded a quite revolutionary view as to
the aims and method of Euripides. The Essay on the
Hercules Furens was a work of interpretation not of
editing, and his editions of the Ion and the four plays of
Aeschylus consist largely of interpretative matter. There
is one, and only one, of Dr. Verrall's works which can be
considered as an edition in the ordinary sense, and that is
the Medea.
I may add that the Essay on the Hercules Furens was
pubHshed in 1905 in a volume which also contained an
Essay on the Orestes. I have not, however, been able to
ascertain when this last Essay was begun, and accordingly
do not suggest any direct connection between the script
in question and that play, from which were drawn the
words which were the subject of the experiment.
To revert to the '
herb moly '
script, while I have no
doubt that the object of this script, and of the Benson-
Wellington scripts, was to establish, via the Medea, an
Euripides -Dr. Verrall -Mrs. Verrall connection, I also sug-
gest, more speculatively, that there is an attempt to add,
by means of the Introduction to the play, an essential
item to the description of the Old Man in White.
One of the causes of manuscript errors to which Dr.
158 W. H. Salter [part 5
Verrall refers is the substitution of common words for rare
or archaic ones, e.g. '
peasant ' for '
swain.' '
Peasant '
i
might be written over '
swain ' by way of gloss or ex- (
planation in one MS., and be substituted for 'swain' in [
a later MS. deriving from the first. He supposes that we
have among our MSS. a glossary to JMilton, containing the
entries Swain, a peasant, and Sckip, a hag ; and that in
consequence some of the MSS. gave in 11. 634 and 626
respectiveh' the readings '
peasant '
and '
leathern bag '
for
the '
swain '
and '
leathern scrip '
of the original.
Now the f)articular example he gives of the supposed 1
perversion of '
scrip '
into '
bag '
seems to me significant. [
Readers of Mr. Piddington's paper will remember that he i
identifies the Old Man in White of Mrs. Verrall's scripts 'i
with Oedipus as described by Sophocles in the Oedipus \<
Coloneus, and by Jebb in his notes to that play. All the ^
details of the description, Oedipus' blindness, his age, his
white hairs, his staff, his loneliness '
alone with God and i
none other,' the white robes put on by him before his t
passing, appear clearly in the scripts. One detail only is s
missing, or rather fails to come out distinctly. Oedipus, i
as beggar, should carry a wallet : the old man of the I
scripts carries '
a small square box '
which '
might be a [
book." Mr. Piddington conjectures, with great probability, e
that the box or book of the scripts was a visual misinter- a
pretation by the automatist of the idea of a wallet, c
'
which was squarish and made of leather.' i
If the idea of '
wallet '
had come through correctly, it ?
seems probable that Dr. and Mrs. Verrall would have '[
recognised the allusions to Oedipus, have Ijeen led thereby
to refreshing their memory of Jebb's edition, and so
arrived at the connection with the Orestes passage which
Mr. Piddington has elucidated. The mistake of '
box '
. or
'
book,' small as it was, appears to have sufficed to put
them oft' the track. I suggest that the emphatic advice
to '
find the herb moly,' i.e. to consult the Introduction
'
to the Medea, had, as one of its objects, l)y drawing their ]
attention to perversions of sense, substitution of words and
the idea of a '
leathern scrip '
or wallet, to put them
back on the right line of enquiry.

On my communicating the substance of this note to
Mr. Piddington, he wrote in reply, " I think there is

1 This script, of which I was not previously aware, was
,
produced after Dr. Verrall's death. Whoever may have
f inspired it, there seems a clear intention to emphasise the
i importance of the only previous reference in Mrs. Verrall's
'
scripts to this passage of Comtis, namely that of the 9th
September, 1901.
In any case, and whether my interpretation be right or
wrong, it is curious that both Dr. and Mrs. Verrall, when
casting about for possibly relevant associations with Comus,
should have overlooked the Introduction to the Medea, in
view of the circumstances attending the publication of the
book and its presentation by one to the other. It would,
however, seem not infrequently to be the case that persons
engaged in the production of scripts fail to recognise
allusions and associations which they would in other
circumstances be the first to seize on. Perhaps this is a
merciful dispensation, framed so as to enable those of us
who have not the gift of automatism to take a part,
however small, in the great game.
II. THE PRECOCIOUS OLIVE.
By J. G. Piddington.
In her account (Proc, Vol* XX., pp. 156-167) of the
" One-Horse Dawn " experiment Mrs. Verrall (p. 157)
wrote as follows :
—
This experiment was devised by my husband in April
1901, and the three words [/^oi'OTrojAoi' k 'Aw, i.e. " to the
one-horsed Dawii "] were then written down, with the
160 J. O. Piddington [part
intention of seeing whether my hand {i.e. script] would
make any attempt to reproduce his thought. The paper on
which the words were written was put into an envelope,
placed by him, to the best of his belief, in the drawer of
his writing-table, where he is in the habit of keeping
papers. The drawer is not used by anyone but himself.
He had not made, he tells me, any experiment before.
Mrs. Verrall added a footnote to the effect that the paper
on which Dr. Verrall wrote the three words was " mislaid
or lost," and " could not be found when the experiment
was ended."
The experiment, it should be observed, is here said to
have been devised, not merelj^ started, in April 1901 :
that is to say,—if Mrs. Verrall chose her words in this
instance as carefully as she usually did—Dr. Verrall did
not begin to think about the experiment until April 1901.
It is not stated whether the note made of the three words
bore a date, and as this note was lost, we cannot now
ascertain ; and we have to depend on Dr. Verrall's memory
for the date on which the experiment was devised. Dr.
Verrall, however, was a man of an accurate habit of
mind, and there is a strong presumption that, if he stated
that he devised the experiment in April 1901, he did
devise it in that month, and not in March or May or any
other month of 1901.
In a paper called " Fresh Light on the '
One-Horse Dawn '
Experiment," and published in Proc, Vol. XXX., pp. 175-
229, I discussed a number of references in Mrs. Verrall's
//oi'OTTwXoi' e? 'Aw (or, " One-Horse Dawn ") scripts of 1901
and 1902 to an Old Man in White, and argued that they
were all references to Oedipus : chiefly to Oedipus as he
appears in the Oedipus Colonens of Sophocles, though one
very significant reference was implied to a passage in the
Oedipus Tyrannus. I argu^ further that the point of
these references was to be found in various notes of Jebb's
on the Oedipus Coloneus, and especially in a note of his
on the Oedijms Tyrannus in which he gives his view of
the meaning of the disputed word iJLovoirwXov in the
phrase /jloi'ottwXov eV Aw ; and I pointed out that Jebb
I
XCI.] " One-Horse Dawn Scripts " 161
1
gives a cross-reference to this particular note of his own
in his comments on a Chorus in the Oedipus Coloneus to
which Mrs. Verrall's scripts allude. Part of this Chorus
[
consists of a eulogy of the Olive of Attica, and is thus
, translated by Jebb :
—
And a thing there is such as I know not by fame on
Asian ground, or as ever born in the great Dorian isle of
Pelops,—a growth unconquered [(fivrevij.' axeiponoi'], self-
renewing, a terror to the spears of the foemen, a growth
which mightily flourishes in this land,—the gray-leafed
'
olive, nurturer of children [yXavi<a^ Tr(LiooTp6(f>ov (fivkkov
eAai'as]. Youth shall not mar it by the ravage of his
'
! hand, nor any one who dwells with old age ; for the
sleepless eye of the Morian Zeus beholds it, and the
J
gray-eyed Athena [yu yAiu'KUJTrt^ 'Addva].
Co this passage I maintained references were made in the
'ollowing manner in Mrs. Verrall's scripts :

The word eXulov (" of olive-oil ") in M. V. 3049 is an
)bvious slip for eXalai ("of the olive-tree "), as is shown
ijy the context on both sides of it, which means :
—
" With the green foliage of the olive
of the Green-eyed (Athena) herself."
With regard to the epithet TXuuKunrn (" green-eyed," or
'
gray-eyed "), applied to Athena by Sophocles in the
ines quoted above, Jebb observes that it was suggested
Dy the epithet yXavKu^ (" green," or " gray-green ")
ipplied by Sophocles a few Lines earlier to the olive :
—

(" the gray-leafed olive nurturer of children ").
On the second epithet, iruiSoT^ocpou (" child-nurturing ")
I
162 '
J. G. Piddington .
[pARTjsoi:
that Sophocles here bestows on the olive, Jebb has a note,
of which I transcribe a part :
—
" •iraiSoTp6<j)ov, nourishing tlie young lives in the land.
. . . Cj). Juv. Sat. 3, 84 : guod nostra infantia caelum
Hausit Aventini baca mitrila, Sahma^ (the olive)."
The compressed style of this note might mislead. Jebb
does not mean that baca Sahina is a regular name for
olives, like our '
Brazil nuts '
for a particular kind of nut.
He means that baca, literally a berry, is here used for the
fruit of the olive-tree—as, indeed, it often is by other
Latin authors, with or without an epithet to distinguish
it from other '
berries.' By baca Sabina Juvenal meant
Sabine olives.
Meanwhile, the bewildered reader may be wondering
what Sabine berries and Jebb's note on TratSoTpncpou have
got to do with the " One-Horse Dawn " experiment.
The experiment, it will be remembered, was devised in
April 1901. On the afternoon of March 31, 1901,—that is
to say, before Dr. Verrall devised the experiment—Mrs.
Verrall wrote a script containing a good many discon-
nected and apparently meaningless phrases, and among
them this one :
—
praecox aha baccis Sabinis ponetur dis adiuventibus.
It may be translated :
—
" the early olive with Sabine berries will be planted with
the help of the gods." . '
_
Even taken by themselves, the words, olea baccis Sabinis,
would be an almost absolutely certain reference to the
Juvenal passage ; but when we consider that later scripts
of Mrs. Verrall's make repeated allusions to the Oedipus
^ The quotation from Juvenal means :
" (Is it to go so entirely for
nothing) that as a boy I drank in the air of the -Aventine, and was
nurtured on the Sabine berry ?
"
J. E. B. Mayor in the Addenda to his Notes on Juvenal's Third
Satire, gives under the heading " Baca Sabiria " a reference to Sophocles, L|
Oed. Col. 694-706: that is to say, to the precise part of the chorus in
praise of the olive in the Oedipus Goloneus to which reference is made
above, j|(

Goloneus, that the point of these allusions is to be found
in Jebb's notes on that play, and that the only other
mention of the ohve in Mrs. Verrall's scripts for nearly
Sve years to come ^
—namely, " vu-identi coma e\(dou t^??
rXai'/cw-K^o? uvTn'i in M. V. 3049—is effected by means of
in allusion to the very lines containing the word ttulSo-
rpocpov, we are forced, it seems to me, to conclude that
jhe words olea baccis SaUnis in the script of March 31,
1901, are, not only a reference to the Juvenal passage,
out a certain reference to the quotation of the Juvenal
Dassage in Jebb's note on TraiSoTpocjjov.
If that conclusion is, as I believe, inevitable, two things
ollow from it. First, it clinches the argument put
orward in ray paper " Fresh Light on the '
One-Horse
Dawn ' Experiment," which was that the clue to the
•epeated allusions in the " One-Horse Dawn " scripts to
.he Old Man in White and to a good deal of the contexts
)f these allusions is to be found in the Oedipus Goloneus
lid in Jebb's notes thereon.
Secondly, it leaves us faced with a very pretty problem.
?or, at least one day, and perhaps several days, before
Dr. Verrall devised his experiment, allusion was made in
tirs. Verrall's script to a note of Jebb's on a passage in
•he Oedipus Coloneus ; and this passage, as well as other
lotes of Jebb's on the same play and on the companion
)lay Oedipus Tyrannus, was subsequently utilised in Mrs.
Verrall's scripts to indicate the words fxoi'OTrwXov e? 'Aw
v^hich Dr. Verrall fixed upon in April 1901 as the subject
)f his experiment.
Various ways of accounting for this odd fact may be
nvented. If we assume that there is no mistake as to
he time when the experiment was first devised, we might
ake the hne that this new piece of evidence only goes to
how the diabohcal ingenuity of Mrs. Verrall's subliminal
^The first mention of 'olive' after July 31, 1901, is on March 21,
906 ; but this, like all other mentions of the olive in Mrs. Verrall's
3ripts, is in English. The only '
olive '
reference in Latin is on
larch 31, 1901 ; the only one in Greek on July 31, 1901 : the use in

mind, which, not content with contriving an intricate
response to Dr. Verrall's experiment, went further and
fitted this response on to a hterary reference that had
happened to emerge in her script before the experiment
was thought of.
Or, we might assume that, though consciously Dr. Verrall
neither devised nor thought about his experiment until
April 1901, he had nevertheless been subconsciously turning
the matter over, and considering ijlovottwXqv e? 'Aw as a
possible subject for experiment. If this were really the
case, the promptitude and appositeness of Mrs. Verrall's
first reaction to her husband's subconscious thought stand
out in marked contrast to the slowness and difficulty with
which the response was afterwards completed when Dr.
Verrall was consciously trying to convey his thought.
Or again, we might assume that Dr. Verrall's memory
played him false, and that he consciously devised the
experiment before the afternoon of March 31, 1901. But
those who knew Dr. Verrall will not readily, I think, call
in question the accuracy of his memory.
There is a fourth hypothesis that I am not disposed to
press, but which should not be entirely ignored. It is
that Dr. Verrall was not the real originator of the experi-
ment, but that he carried out an experiment which,
though he did not know it, another intelligence had devised
and imposed vipon him. This hypothesis, lilce the other
hypotheses, is, of course, incapable of proof ; but it at
least has the merit of simplicity, and only assumes the
possibility of Dr. Verrall's being open to teiepathk
influence.
Those who prefer to regard all the phenomena of th(
" One-Horse Dawn " case as due to telepathy inter viva
can pitch upon Mrs. Verrall as the intelligence thai
subliminally devised the experiment and telepathicall;5
imposed it on Dr. Verrall.
I may, perhaps, be allowed to add that, knowing th(
ways of scripts, I had often j)uzzled over the '
olive
reference in the script of March 31, 1901, and felt that i
ought to hitch on to the '
olive '
reference in the scrip
of July 31, 1901, in spite of the fact that Dr. Verrall di(

not begin his experiment until April 1901 ; but I never
could see any sense in

note on TraiSoTpocpou.
The epithet praecox, perhaps, deserves attention, for
there is nothing in the Juvenal passage or in the Chorus
in the Oedipus Coloneus in any way answering to it. The
adjective praecox is applied in Latin literature not only to
plants that flower or fruit early, but to plants that fruit
before their time. And that is exactly what the praecox
olea of Mrs. Verrall's script did when it put in a
precocious appearance before the " One-Horse Dawn "
experiment officially began.

THE MECHANISM OF THE SO-CALLED MEDIUMISTIC
TRANCE.
By Dr. Sydney Alrutz.
Lecturer in P.sycho^o'j j at the University of Upsala, Sweden.
^1
The relation of this article to my j^ai^er " The Psychology and
Physiology of the so-called Mediurnistic Trance," read at the
2nd Congress for Psychical Research at Warsaw, 1923, and
jmblished in its Transactions, is as folloivs. In this article
I only give a very brief summary of ivhat I had to say on
Mrs. Piper in my Warsaiv j)a'per, and I must therefore be
allowed to refer readers of these Proceedings to the fuller dis-
cussion there. A few new -points of view are now added here,
however. What folloivs upon that is wholly loritten for these
Proceedings, and does not appear in the Warsaio jiaper.
In this article my intention is to view the so-called
mediurnistic trance and its more important features in
the light of hypnotic phenomena. I believe that by this
method it is possible to attain to a better understanding
not only of the conditions of the trance-state itseK, but
also of what the so-called " personalities," manifesting in
the state, really are or—are not.
Mrs. Piper.
In her elaborate exposition of the psychology of Mrs.
Piper's trance (Vol. XXVIII. of these Proceedings) Mrs.
Sidgwick came to the conclusion that Mrs. Piper's trance
very probably was a state of self-induced hypnosis, in
which she or her hypnotic self, by the help of sugges-
tion, personated different characters either consciously or
iniconsciously.
To begin with, I wish to emphasize the importance of
a certain symptom which Mrs. Piper more or less often
showed in the intermediate stage between her deep sleep
xci.] Mechanism of So-Called Mediumistic Trance 167
or trance and her awake-condition, i.e. in lier coming-to-
state or awakening-condition.
This symptom was echolaha (repetition of words or
sentences uttered by persons present). This proves that
when Mrs. Piper came to she passed through a state of
consciousness which constitutes or corresponds to a
hystero-hypnotic state, called by Charcot, Janet, Ochoro-
wicz and others the cataleptic state, but which I prefer
to call the automatic state, this being a more general
term. In this state the subject—according not only to
my own, but also to observations made by others, e.g.
0. Vogt—hears spoken words, but does not understand
them. He repeats them parrot-like. The only form of
suggestibihty of which he might be said to be capable
is one caused by images. These provoke hallucinations
and, on the motor side, correspoijding automatic actions.
It is interesting that echolalia may also show itself not
only in certain cases of mental disease, often accompanied
by echopraxia and echomimia, but also in encejjhalitis
lethargica or on account of a bullet-wound in the frontal
lobe of the bram (F3), etc. Here there exists no reason
to suppose that it is caused by suggestion or at will.
It can therefore very well be conceived to show itself,
when functional brain disturbances or blockades of a
certain kind exist, as for mstance in certain trance-phases,
without the help of any suggestion or volition on the
part of the subject. The opinion, held by probably most
modern hypnotizers, that echolalia in hypnosis is due to
mental suggestion, as Mrs. Sidgwick rightly puts it, cannot
be maintained any longer. And for these reasons : (1) it
can occur, as I have found it to do, quite unexpectedly and
unprovoked ;
^
(2) it occurs in a definite state, lying between
what I caU " light " and " deep " hypnosis, which can be
produced experimentally, and in which verbal suggestions are
not obeyed, because not understood ; (3) mtelligent intro-
spection, as in Vogt's case, confirms the truth of this ; and
(4) similar reactions, for instance mimicry, occur in the same
hypnotic, i.e. the automatic state, as echolalia does.
^ This is also the opinion of Ochorowicz and Wingfield, as stated in
a personal communication to me.
168 Dr. Sydney Alrvtz [part
As the echolalia occurred in the awakening-stage, it is
evident that Mrs. Piper's deep sleep and trance proper
—
see the synoptic table below—represented a nervous
condition in which the inhibition was still more profound
than in the automatic stage. She was, consequently, in
a state—let us call it a state of lethargy—where her
capabilitj^ of giving herself auto-suggestions, or d fortiori
of receivuag and realismg suggestions from without, had
ceased to exist. It is also evident from other symptoms
that the trance-sfcate involved a diminution of excitability
stretching more or less far down in the central nervous
system: the lessened respiratory frequency (7-10 per minute)
the general insensibility and inertness, the lessened or
inhibited reflexivity, the total colour-blindness (Mrs. Piper
saw objects, faces, black), the micropsia (objects were
seen very much diminished), etc.
In this deep hypnosis Mrs. Piper doubtless also was
incapable of receiving telepathic suggestions. The experi-
ments of Ochorowicz seem to prove this. One of his
subjects was very clearly susceptible to telepathic impulses
of a motor kind in the automatic state. This form of
sensibility ceased however in the lethargic state.
The ijrobability tliat the personalities of Mrs. Piper's
trance and their sayings and doings depended on auto-
suggestion from the medium or on telepathic suggestions
from the sitters, as Mrs. Sidgwick supposes, must therefore
be considered very small indeed.
I do not want to give the impression that I accept all
tlie characteristics of Charcot's well-known and much
criticized three states of hystero-hypnosis : the somnambulistic,
the cataleptic and the lethargic states. The important
point is whether, when hypnotising persons of a certain
nervous type deeper and deeper, an inhibition of the
mental and nervous functions, the brain and nerve centres
respectively, as well as a corresponding secondary enhance-
ment of other functions and centres, takes place in a
certain general order, independent of suggestions and auto-
suggestions, and whether these progressive alterations in the
excitability of the different parts and levels of the nervous
system are in the main best accounted for by assuming
xci.] Mechanism of So-Called Mecliumistic Trance 169
the existence of three distinct states. I am inclined to
believe that this really is the case. It is, on the other
hand, of minor importance whether the speciiic and con-
stant characteristics of each stage were correctly appre-

There is another curiovis feature, which occurred in the
awakening state of Mrs. Piper : the so-called " head-
snaps. "Shortly before normal consciousness returned
an experience constantly occurred which Mrs. Piper de-
scribed as her head snapping, and which she half seemed
to expect the sitter to hear. Generally this snap occurred
twice, with a short interval between, before she completely
recovered her normal consciousness. {Proc, Vol. XXVIII.
p. 23.)
Mrs. Sidgwick imagines that the sensation is due to
some change in the flow of blood to the brain, and adds
that " Mrs. Piper takes this view herseK, perhaps as the
result of a suggestion from some sitter." She said once :
" My head goes s-s-click. I think the blood settles back
in my brain and then I am conscious."
Only quite lately I have been able to find an experience
analogous to ]Mrs. Piper's clicks. In a few articles Mr.
Oliver Fox (really Mr. Hugh G. Callawaj') has described
experiments in " Dream-travelling." These are too com-
plicated to be given here in full.^ I can only give certain
points in this paper. Mr. Callaway had been trying to
prolong a certain kind of dream :
" Dreams of knowledge,"
i.e. dreams in which he had the knowledge that he was
dreaming. He found that by exercising his will he could
resist the " attraction " of the body and considerably
prolong the dream. The effort, however, produced a
slowly increasing pain in what he imagined to be the
region of the pineal gland. He made the experiment of
fighting this pain. It then ceased quite suddenly and
something seemed to " click " in his head. Upon this he
appeared "to be in the position of a permanently
disembodied spirit," i.e. " out of the body." By will
power he managed " to return to his body," but the
after effects were bad. After this he found that when
he was in the iro/?ce-condition he could " leave the body "
by a sudden effort of will, and still later he found that the
" right " method to do this was to will that his incorporate
self should pass through the doorway of the pineal gland.
When this was done the little click sounded in his brain.
1 See The Occult Review, 1920, pp. 190 and 251, and 1923, p. 332.
xci.] Mechanism of So-Called Mednimistic Trance 171
When this method was -used there was no restrictmg:
" pineal " pain as before, no break in consciousness, no
difficulty in " re-entering the body " when he wished.
Mr. Callaway puts forward the theory that when
" dreams of knowledge " take place, a third state of con-
sciousness is the result, and he adds : "To prove that
the soul actually leaves the body is practically impossible,
for the experience may be purely subjective." Still he
considers that, to his ow7i satisfaction, he has proved the
" existence of his soul."
In a letter to me Mr. Callaway Avrites that he has
never read any detailed account of Mrs. Piper's trances,
though her name was, of course, known to him.
It would, of course, be wrong to attach much import-
ance to a single person's experiences of this kind. But it
certainly is rather curious, that in the . only case besides
Mrs. Piper's—known to me, at least,—where such clicks in
the brain can be produced quasi-experimentally, they
should occur just at that point or moment when the
experimenter feels and considers himseh to have " left the
body "
—whatever this may mean ^
—diiring a trance
condition.
There is another experience of Mr. Callaway's which
reminds me of one of Mrs. Piper's.
Once, when coming to and after the head-snap, Mrs. Piper
said : "I want to tell you the strangest thing. I had
two distinct pairs of eyes. I used the one pair behind
the other and looked through these eyes (touching her
own) as if they were spectacles. They looked like marbles . .
.
And Mr. Hodgson, when I saw you first ifc was through
the other pair of eyes and you didn't look as you do
now." (Just before she had said that she had two
distinct brains ..." one looks like sulphur burning, the
otlier like flesh") {Proc, Vol. XXVIII, p. 222).
Mr. Callaway relates that when in a certain experiment
he " concentrated " on its preliminary stages, he felt a
general numbness, his whole body stiffened and his eyes

for considering himself to have been out of his bodj^ see Mr. Callaway's
articles.

closed tightly {The Occult Review, 1923, p. 336). Then
came the sensation of possessing another pair of eyes, and
these " astral eyes " he opened. As he did this he
seemed to turn right round within his physical body, so
that he faced the other direction, etc.
What this felt duplication of eyes (and brain) really
means is difficult to decide. Still, the coincidence between
Mrs. Piper's and IMr. Callaway's experiences deserves to be
noted, and investigators ought to be on the look-out for
similar observations in the future.
Mrs. Leonard.
I now intend to give as a further example of the
mediumistic trance the case of the well-known medium
Mrs. Osborne Leonard, because she is still in full activity,
and it is therefore probably quite possible to get a
thorough examination of her different trance or hypnotic
stages from a purely psychological and neurological point
of view, which hitherto has not been done.
This medium presents, according to Una, Lady Trou-
bridge (Proc, S.P.R. Vol. XXXII. , p. 349), first of all^ a
condition, characterised by a slight drowsiness, productive
of automatic script, which has proved on several occasions
to convey accurate knowledge of events unknown to the
medium. Lady Troul)ridge asks if we iftay see in this
condition a relatively light hypnosis not followed by any
amnesia.
Mrs. Leonard further presents a partially analgesic trance,
in which she appears to be somewhat hyperaesthetic of
hearing. In the trance she shows the characteristics of a
personality quite foreign to her waking self. This is the
personality known as Feda. Also in this state Mrs.
Leonard gives evidence of supernormal knowledge. Lady
Troubridge believes this state to be a lower hypnotic
level than the former one, a deep somnambulism. I wish to
say that the hyperaesthesia of hearing seems to me in
this case certain only for the time which precedes a sitting,
i.e. when hypnosis is coming on. and is then quite what
we should expect. This hyperaesthesia consequently does
xci.] Mechanism of So-Called Mediumistic Trance 173
not ill an}^ way preclude the trance itself being a. deep
condition. A,s to the analgesia I should like to know
what is really meant by partially or "to some great
extent " anaesthetic and analgesic.
Fmally comes another trance condition, in which
according to I^ady Tronbridge IN'Irs. Leonard reproduces
the vocal characteristics and mannerisms of deceased
persons of both sexes, who were never known to her
during their lives. In this state the motor faculties are
largely in abeyance. Whereas Feda can easily move
about and talk loudly, these so-called personal controls
have, as Lady Troubridge expresses it, very limited
command of the organism as regards motion and vocal
energy (p. 362). Mrs. Leonard lies like a log against the
chair, and therefore seems to have lost her muscular tonus
to a great extent. The arrival so to say of a personal
control is announced by a long, sometimes very long, and
steady exhalation of breath, whereas Peda's arrival is
only heralded by a few moments of mere quiescence
(p. 365). At least one personal control shows a pronounced
hyperaesthesia of touch affecting the fingers. The personal
controls can only be mamtained for a short time. On
account of this and other features (the power of mental
concentration is for instance weakened), Lady Troubridge
beheves that this condition is possibly yet another and
still lower hypnotic level.
Later, on account of Mi'. Irving's letter {Journal, 1922,
p. 266), Lady Troubridge emphasises the circumstance
that the personal controls have access to the Feda material,
whereas Feda has only a very fragmentary and occasional
knowledge of the personal control material. This, however,
we might regard, writes Lady Troubridge, as some unusual
and momentary shiftmg of the levels, which gives Feda,
for an instant only, access to material which is generally
outside her purview and which might be acquired
telepathically by her durmg the periods when she herself
governs the organism (p. 291). This superiority in the
field of knowledge on the part of the personal controls
would then be another point in favour of regarding them
as representing a still deeper hypnotic level then Feda.
i74 Dr. Sydney Alruiz . [part
I should like to accentuate the desirability of distinguish-
ing here more exactly between two things. On the one
hand the condition of Mrs. Leonard's organism during the
emergence of Feda or the personal controls, i.e. the trance
state per se ; on the other hand the psycho-physiological
nature of these personalities themselves.^ But can such
a division be made ? How can we know what belongs
to the one and what to the other ? Three points seem
able to help us here : (1) our general knowledge of pure
(hystero-) hypnotic states ; (2) our knowledge of the nature
of Mrs. Leonard's condition immediately before and after
the emergence of the personalities ; (3) the circumstances
that these different outbursts apparently form coherent
organic unities, of which certain utterances, movements, etc.,
are integral parts.
To begin with the personal controls. It seems from the
description given by Lady Troubridge as i£ there existed a
special nervous condition, which precedes the trance per se,
runs through this and also succeeds it for about a minute.
I admit, however, that the data for this assertion are
rather poor. In the case of Mrs. Piper they are much
stronger. Still it seems as if there exists such a condition
also here, and that this is a state corresponding to a very
deep stage in (hystero-) hypnosis (the lethargic stage).
During this condition a partial restitution or revivification
of certain functions for an unknown reason takes place in
the form of speech (usually very weak), movements (very
limited), increase of muscular tone (hardly sufficient to
keep the vertebral column erect), and in one case hyper-
aesthesia (of fingers). Of these, speech seems to be the
only restitution which necessarily belongs to or expresses
the mental activity behind. Regarding the other symptoms
this connection is not quite clear, at least as far as Lady
Troubridge's information goes. They probably, however,
also belong to these personalities, as they occur simul-
1 Lady Trovibridge herself in her first paper {S.P.R. Proc. Vol. XXXII.) writes
of the possibility of the different trance conditions being different hypnotic
levels (p. 361). Then Mr. Irving writes about the personal controls being
this, and finallj. Lady Troubridge in lier reply writes that her suggestion
was that these controls represent a deeper hypnotic level.
xci.] Mechanism of So-Called Mediumistic Trance 175
taneously with their utterances.^ But even if this is so, they
may be only secondary and irradiative eifects of the resti-
tution of speecli and its corresponding nervous apparatuses.
As to the personal controls themselves, I think there is
very little evidence that these " entities " as such represent
or constitute a still deeper hypnotic level than Feda.
Even assuming Lady Troubridge to be in the right as to
their wider memory-range, I do not think that this is any
evidence in this respect. And for this reason, that they
are not really the inner side of coinjyhte hypnotic states,
but oiily—at the best—partial restitutions of such states.
Only of the former has it been assumed, with more or less
reason, that the deeper the hypnosis the more com-
prehensive the memory-range.^ Further : if we accept
telepathy as an explanation of Feda's incidental knowledge
of a personal control, why shouldn't telepathy also be able
to work the other way ?
The weakness, short duration and incompleteness of the
personal controls in comparison to that of Feda might very
easily be explained by the circumstance that Feda
obviously " emerges " from a lighter hypnotic state, where
the resistance to be overcome is less than in the lethargic
state, while the restitution, apparently brought about in
some way by the personal controls, demands a greater
output of energy.
In conclusion : all we can say is that the manifestation
of the personal controls takes place in a state of trance or
auto-hypnosis probably much deeper than the state from
which Feda emerges. As to the personaUties themselves,
it is of very little use comparing them to hypnotic levels
or egos at all, much less considering them to he such
^ Note here Lady Troubridge's observation, that the sitter must be on
the alert to catch Mrs. Leonard's body as the personal control comes to
an end (p. 366). May I ask a question : Who complains of the hyperaes-
thesia of the fingers as being " actually distressful " ? And does this
sensitiveness serve any purpose ?
^ There exists, however, no proof that Prof. Morton Prince in the case
of Miss Beauchamp had hypnotised B2 deeper than usual on the first
occasion B3 appeared. B3 had, however, a wider memory-range than B2.
And can we also in other cases be certain at \^'hat " level " a " person-
ality " is formed ?
176 Dr. Sydney Alrutz [part xc
levels. The mental life of the personal controls is not
inferior, seemingly, to that of Feda, whereas the deepest
(hystero-) hypnotic stage (the lethargic one) generally
shows much less mental activity, if any at all, than the
lighter ones—imless complications exist. As to the memory-
range, I should like to ask Lady Troubridge a question
or two. Is there not, to begin with, some evidence of
Feda's knowing the contents of the minds of the personal
controls from the circumstance that Feda, at least on the
face of it, transmits the thoughts of the personal controls,
for instance of A. V. B. 1 Now, seeing that, according to
Lady Troubridge, Feda generally has no knowledge of
personal control material, whereby no doubt is meant the
utterances of a personal control when really controlling, i.e.
when influencing Mrs. Leonard without intervention from
another source, the question arises : is there any evidence
that the thoughts of a certain personal control, say of
A. V. B., which Feda transmits, and the utterances of A. V. B.
as a personal control, really belong to each other or to a
common personal source ? If there is such evidence,
would not this then show that Feda at times really does
get at the minds of what we call the personal controls ?
When using the expression " restitution " of Mrs.
Leonard's organism, I do not of course mean that the
whole thing is explained by such a process. I can locally
or partially restitute a subject in deep hypnosis by simply
holding my hand above his : the sensibility returns then at
this place (on the hand). I can also by upward passes
over one arm, again, as in the former case, without
contact, e.g. through a sheet of glass, and taking as before
every precaution so that the subject cannot Imow or
suspect what I am doing, restore the sensibility, etc., on
that half of the body. That is not, however, a complete
analogy to what occurs in Mrs. Leonard's case, when a
personal control comes on. But if we suppose that in some
such way, by nervous effluence or otherwise, I could first
restore Mrs. Leonard's vocal organs, peripheral and central,
and then by the help of telepathy make these restored
parts of Mrs. Leonard's organism talk and give utterance
to my thoughts—then we should have, I believe, a process
xci.] Mechanism of So-Called Medhimistic Trance 177
which at least could be compared to what seems to take
place when a personal control manifests.
Other Mediums.
I lately examined (at the British College for Psychic
Science) a young man who put himself into an apparent
trance without any help from anybody present, and who
in this state manifested at least two different trance-person-
alities. There was a very great difference in the easiness
with which the knee-jerk reflexes could be evoked in the
awake condition, and the difficulty, not to say impossibility,
with which they could be shown to exist at all in the
trance state. And when the subject was awakening from
the trance state the returning of the knee-jerk reflex by
degrees could be very nicely observed. This was also
confirmed by a medical man present. There were also
interesting alterations in the sensibility. These changes
gave me the conviction that no shamming of the trance-
state as such occurred in this case, and also that the
trance-state in question involved a deep-reaching inhibition
of the excitability of the nervous system (as far as
the spmal cord). I was prevented from making further
examinations, but what I have put forward may be enough
to show once more the importance of always making a
neurological examination in such cases, if possible.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ^ has made some observations
which show the importance of studying . the pulse-rate in
trance. He found that a medium, Mr. Tickner, showed
remarkable variations in this respect. Before and after
a certain sitting the pulse rate was 78 per minute, but
during trance and when a certain " personality " manifested
it showed 124 (for about twenty minutes running), and
when another " personahty " came on the scene it showed
100. Sir Arthur writes with much reason that it may be
that we have an exceUent check against fraud in these
pulse-variations. I should like to add that they may
also aid us in understanding the mechanism of the trance-
condition and the restitutions taking place there.
1" Pulse-rate in Trance." Jour, of the Am. S.P.R., July 1923, p. 374.
178 Dr. Sydney Alrutz [part
I once registered the respiration and pulse of a gentleman
who claimed that he could " leave his body," and who,
in order to do this, sent himseK into a trance. No
reactions followed in this state on stimulation of the skin
senses, the knee-jerk reflex was absent, etc. During the
trance I held a sharp-smelling liquid under his nostrils ;
no reactions ensued, excepting a flattening out of the
respiration-curves for about 20 seconds. When, however,
the subject commenced the deep respiration which he
usually employed in order to " bring himseK back," and
had made two inspirations and expirations, he very
suddenly began to sneeze and complained of a sharp and
nasty smell. This seems to me good evidence of the
absence of the sense of smell during the trance-state.
The phenomenon itself can be interpreted in two ways :
either there remained enough smelling-particles in the
nostrils to prodiice the reaction when the olfactory organ
had regamed its sensitiveness, or an excitation of the
olfactory nerve and tract occurred already during trance,
but could not lead to a result because of the lessened
excitability of the corresponding centres in that state.
The Method of the Psycho-Galvanic Reflex.
Mr. Whately Smitli has put forward the idea {Proc.
S.P.B., Vol. XXXT., p. 401) that these problems might be
elucidated with the help of the phenomenon known as
the psycho-galvanic reflex, already inaugurated by Prince
and Peterson for this purpose.
There seems to exist a difficulty here, which Mr. Whafcely
Smith in my opinion undervalues. I mean the loss of
sensibility which encounters us in most trances or deep
hypnotic istates. Also hyperaesthesia may obtain here, at
least locally, as we have seen, and probably as a sign of
restitution. In light hypnosis we also often meet hjrper-
aesthesia, mostly I should think as a secondary symptom.
Mr. Whately Smith observes, however (p. 409, note), that
in cases of functional anaesthesia in connection with
dissociation the subject will re-act just as well on the
anaesthesic areas as on the normally sensitive ones. But
xci.] Mechanism of So-Called Mednmiistic Trance 179
the possibility, not to say the probability, exists here
that functional disturbances of sensibihty may occur which
do not depend—or do not depend solely—on dissociation,
and that in such cases the disturbances may involve
changes in the excitability even of the periplieral sensitive
nerves or nerve-organs. This is far from improbable,
because such changes can be shown to exist in regard to
motor peripheral nerves in the deep hyjmosis of certain
subjects. The electric kritabihty of such nerves has in
point of fact been found to be considerably lessened in
such a state (see my article " Problems of Hypnotism,"
Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXII., 1921, p. 169). On the other
hand this irritability has been found to be increased ui
certain other hypnotic states, and Krafft-Ebuig found that
such an enhancement could be observed as a result of
paralysis by suggestion {Eine experimenteUe Studie auf dem
Gebiete des Hypnotismus, 3rd ed., 1893, p. 62). We must
therefore reckon with the possibiUty that functional
anaesthesia may also mean a decrease of nervous excit-
ability stretching down as far as to the periphery. And this
form of anaesthesia ought certainly to affect the psycho-
galvanic reflexes.
In such circumstances it would seem to be far the
best thing to begui the study of the psycho-galvanic
reflex-phenomena on different forms of hjrpnosis, for
instance, on hypnosis with hemilateral changes, and,
perhaps most important of aU, on forms where the anaes-
thesia has been produced by suggestion, or by passes, or
by the deep hypnosis itself. When all this has been
cleared up the time may be ripe to attack the " big
problem " proposed by Mr. Whately Smith.
I have entered rather deeply mto this question, because
1 am of the opinion that the psycho-galvanic reflex really
is an important method for our purpose, and because
Professor Veraguth himself, the uiventor of the method,
proposed to me some time ago to use it in order to
examine if the changes in the sensibihty brought about
by passes are of a peripheral nature or not. I have not
yet, however, had the opportunity to do this. I hope now
that Mr. Whately Smith, with his large experience of how
M
180 Dr. Sydney Alrutz [part
this method works, will devote some of his time and
interest to the application of it to the important neuro-
logical problems which I have put forward and discussed
here.
Conclusion.
I hope that what I have advanced in this paper justifies
the following assertion. If we have comjjlete and clearly
formulated examinations of how a medium behaves and
reacts in different states to questions and suggestions, how
his or her senses, pulse, respiration and reflexes function,
etc., we can with much greater confidence decide to what
hypnotic level a certain trance condition per se corresponds,
and consequently also what sort of mental activity the
medium himself in such a condition is capable of, e.g. if
he is suggestible or not, and also what kind of suggesti-
bility exists. And we might also be able to decide if
the trance condition is of a kind which permits the
receiving of real telepathic impressions or not.
Furthermore, when we encounter trance states where
certain curious upheavals or restitutions occur which
sometimes seem to form a " personality " of some kind or
other, if we then examine also these personalities not only
from a psychological but also from a neurological point
of view, we shall be able to distinguish better between
the medium's " own " states and the foreign ones, and
consequently be in a more favourable position to judge of
the origin and nature of the latter.

Method of Scoring Coincidences .181
A METHOD OF SCORING COINCIDENCES IN
TESTS WITH PLAYING CARDS.
By R. a. Fisher, M.A.,
Fellow of Gonville and Cains College, Cambridge : Chief Statistician,
Rothamsted Experimental Station.
The problem of scoring a series of possible events so as to
measure appropriately the degree of success attained in
each trial seems to He on the borderline between the
purely deductive region of mathematical probability and
the region of arbitrary choice. The particular problem in
respect of which this note is written serves to illustrate
what abstract principles are available in arriving at a
rational system of scormg, and may be of use in dealuig
with more complex cases.
If two playing cards are obtained from different packs,
the maximum degree of success is clearly obtained if they
are corresponding cards of the same suit ;
but, short of
this we shall have obtamed some degree of resemblance if
the cards are either corresponding cards of different suits
or if they are of the same suit. A lower degree of success,
but still one which is worth counting, will have been
attained if the two cards are of the same rank (both
plain or both picture cards), or even if they are of the
same colour. There are in fact nine possibilities, to each
of which we need assign an appropriate score, and these
wiU be represented as follows :
00 No resemblance, a j^lain card and a picture card of
different colours.
CO A plain card and a picture card of the same colour, but
of different suits.
SO A plain card and a picture card of the same suit.
OR Both plain or both picture cards of different colours.
182 R. A. Fisher [PAET
CR Both plain or both picture cards of the same colour,
but of different suits.
SR Both plain or both picture cards of the same suit.
ON Corresponding cards of different colours.
CN Corresponding cards of the same colour, but of different
siiits. \
SN Corresponding cards of the same suit.
If the cards are both plain or both picture cards we
may speak of them as having the same rank ; if they are
corresponding cards we may speak of them as having the
same value, using this term to include the distinction
between Knave, Queen and King.
There are certain conditions respecting the order of tht,
classes, which any satisfactory system of scoring musi
satisfy. It is evident that each S class must score more
than the corresponding C class, and still more than the
corresponding 0 class ;
equally each N class must score
more than the corresponding R class, and still more than
the corresponding 0 class. These fundamental conditions
may be represented in the following diagram, in whic^ ^
the arrows point, in each case from a class with the lowe.
to a class with tlie higher score :
^OR .
^CN i
00" 'CR 'SN
"'CO"'' "'SR^'
^so-^
These conditions as to the order of the scores still
leave much latitude as to the actual scores to be assigned
to each class. In order to proceed further it is necessary
to take account of the relative rarity, upon purely random
conditions, of the several possible classes.
A circimistance which gives a clue to a rational system
of scoring is that in every one of the three groups 0,
R and N, the class S differs from the class C in being
right instead of wrong on an even chance ;
for, given that
the cards are of the same colour, it is an even chance
that they wiJl also be of the same suit, consequently the
AET
our,
xci.] Method of Scoring Coincidences 183
difference iu score between SO and CO, should be the
same as the difference in score between SR and CR, and
the same as the difference between SN and CN. Also
each C class differs from the corresponding 0 class in
being right instead of wrong on an even chance, and we
may, i£ not as a logical necessity, at least as a rational
convention, postulate that each C class shall exceed the
corresponding 0 class in score by as much as it is exceeded
by the corresponding S class. If the difference in score
between each of these 6 paks of classes be x units, evi-
dently each S class will exceed the corresponding 0 class
by 2x xmits.
. There is, I think, only one rational generalisation of
this rule, namely, that if the best class of a group of
classes occurs in random samples of that group once in
n trials, then its score differs from the lowest score in the
group by a quantity proportional to the logarithm of 7i.
If we accept this rule the determination of the relative
scores in the R and ISl classes becomes purely a problem
probabihty ; the cards wUl be of the same rank 109
.jiimes in 169 random samples, and of these 13 give the
same value ; the differences between the nine classes wiU
therefore be proportional to the following
:
C = log 2= -3010300
S=2C = -6020600
B=logi^= -1904602
109
N = log 13 = 1-1139434;
giving the following 9 scores :
-0 -R -X
O- 0 -1904602 1-1139434
C- -3010300 -4914902 1-4149734
S- -6020600 -7925202 1-7160034.
It is a matter of indifference to the principle upon
which these values ^^•ere obtained, and to our actual
conclusions from any experiment, if these scores are
altered either by adcUng any constant value to all the
scores, or by multiplying them by any factor, or by both
184 B. A. Fisher [PAET
processes. Their application to practical tests will, however,
require comparison to be made with the mean value, and
with the standard deviation. To simplify these applications
it will probably be most convenient to bring the mean
value to zero, so that in any experiment the observed
mean score shall measure the actual deviation from the
mean to be expected upon purely random conditions.
It will also be convenient to make the standard deviation
to take some simple value, such as 10, in order to facili-
tate tests of whether the observed deviation from expecta-
tion is really significant of something more thaii chance.
If we do this the following scores are obtained :
-0 -R -N
0- -11-18 -6-11 + 18-50
C- - 3-16 + 1-91 + 26-53
s- + 4-86 + 9-94 + 34-55.
Using these scores the statistical significance of a series
of observations may be tested by calculating the average
score, and comparing it to its standard error 10/Jn,
where n is the number of observations averaged.
To illustrate this test I am indebted to Dr. V. J.
Woolley for the following results of 49 cards drawings
under approximately random conditions ; the numbers of
occurrences in each class were
-0 -R -N
0- 10 18 1
c- 1 C) 2
s- 3 7 1
The total score on the above system is -31-21, from
which the mean score is -0-64; the square root of 49 is 7,
so that the standard error is 10/7 = 1-43. The mean score
is thus, in this case, negative, and distinctly less than the
standard error. In all cases where the mean score is less
than twice its standard error it is unsafe to argue that
any cause other than pure chance is required to produce
the observed deviation from expectation.
Some error is necessarily introduced by using a limited
number of decimal places. If we use two places, as above,
XCI.] Method of Scoring Coincidences 185
the scoring appears to be sufficiently accurate for dealing
with samples up to a hundred million ; if we cut off the
last place the bias begins to show at about 17,000.
Very little labour is, however, saved by excluding the
extra figure, and if we retain it the error is quite negligible
even if a large body of data is compiled on this system
from different sources.
Summary.
To each guess is allotted one of the following scores :
Nothing correct- ...... -11-18
Rank {i.e. plain or picture) correct, but
nothing else - - - - - - - 6-11
Colour correct, but nothing else - - - - 3-16
Colour and rank correct - - - - - +1-91
Suit correct, but nothing else - - - - + 4'86
Suit and rank correct - - - - - + 9-94
Value correct, but colour wrong - - - + 18-50
Value and colour correct, but suit wrong - +26'53
Value and suit correct ..... +34-55
If the average score of n guesses is greater than twice
~j- we are jastified in assuming that the guesses are
more accurate than we should expect them to be if they
were due entirely to chance.

The " Oscar Wilde " Script.
I. Psychic Ilessages frotn Oscar Wilde. Edited by Hester
Travers Smith, with a preface by Sir Wu.liam Barrett,
F.R.S. (Published by T. Werner Laurie Ltd., London, 1924.
8vo. Pp. 179.)
II. " A New Message from Oscar Wilde," with introduction and
discussion by Mr. V.'s brother. [Occult Review for
November, 1923.)
III. " The Oscar Wilde Scri2)t : A Criticpie by the brother of 31r. F."
{Psycltic Science for January, 1924.)
I SHALL refer to the above-mentioned book and articles in what
follows as I., II., and III. The " messages " with which they are
concerned came through Mx. V. by automatic writing, or Mrs.
Travers Smith by an ouija-board, and all between June 8 and
October 8, 1923, except that Mrs. Travers Smith has included in
her book two fragments of later date (Dec. 14, 1923, and January
4, 1924). The majority of them have been published from time
to time in newspapers and periodicals, and have excited con-
siderable interest. But this scattered pubUcation does not afford
a convenient means of studying them, and aU serious students
of automatism will welcome both Mrs. Travers Smith's book,
bringing together a number of the scrii^ts, and the very valuable
discussion of Mi\ V.'s script by his brother. For there is no
doubt that these communications, some twenty-five in number
and generally of considerable length, professing to come from Oscar
Wilde, suggesting his style throughout and (in the automatic
scrij^t) his handwriting, and also mentionmg a few true
incidents in his life of which the automatists had no conscious
knowledge—there is no doubt that these communications form
an addition to our knowledge of automatism which no one
studying the subject can afford to neglect. But when we
examine them m detail, and especially when we look for the source
of the inspiration—the mmd directing the script—and ask e.g.
XCI.] Reviews 187
if Oscar Wilde was really concerned, many difficulties present
themselves. No hypothesis so far formulated is without them,
and the scripts raise problems rather than solve them.
Before describing the development of the communications
it may be well to point out that " messages," though a con-
venient name for them, is perhaps a little misleading. For
there is no suggestion that Oscar Wilde had anything he wanted
specially to say except when attempting to give some reminis-
cences which might afford evidence of identity (see especially
I. pp. 65-67 and III. 320-323). For the rest the communications
seem for the most part attempts to amuse and interest in
Oscar Wilde's manner by conversation or by short essays, both
full of Avitty or cynical epigrams, intentional exaggeration,
quaint metaphors, and arresting turns of phrase.
As I have said, two automatists were concerned in the pro-
duction of these scripts, and on the first appearance of " Oscar
Wilde " they were workmg together. Neither, however, had
any special interest in Wilde, nor are they aware of anything
having occurred to recall his memory, and neither was well read
in Wilde's witings, though Mrs. Travers Smith had read more
than Mr. V. Mr. V., wishuig if possible to develop a power of
automatic writing, had jomed a class held by Mi's. Travers
Smith for the purpose. After two blank sittings his hand
wrote a few words purportmg to come from a deceased friend,
and, so far as they went, appropriate I understand. But they
came when Mrs. Travers Smith's hand rested lightly oh his,
and without partnership of this sort he has practically not
succeeded in obtaming automatic writing at all—his pencil
merely taps the paper. Nor can any one taken at random
serve as a partner. Mr. V. has tried with a good many in
vain, but in the scripts before us three ladies besides Mrs.
Travers Smith have at different times successfully given the
necessary help by placing hand or fingers on his wrist. One
question that arises is, m what way does this partner influence
the writing 1 Does she merely facilitate it by increasmg Mr.
V.'s confidence and thus perhaps breaking down some inhibition,
or is it a case of joint automatism ? Does the partner's mind
subconsciously operate jointly with Mr. V.'s, or at least serve
jomtly with his as a chamiel of communication ? It must be
remembered that Mr. V. writes with his eyes shut, and is not
188 Eleanor Mildred Sidgwich [part
aware at the moment of what is bemg written except perhaps
a word now and then.^ In fact he finds it advantageous to
concentrate his mind on something unconnected with the work
in hand—such as a calculation or mathematical question. The
partner on the other hand follows the writmg—or at least
Mrs. Travers Smith does.^
At the next sitting they had the same deceased friend began,
" I want my daughter Lily, my little Lily," when at the word
hly anotlier communicator mtervened with the words, " No
the lily is mine not his " and a soi disant Oscar Wilde made
his first app.earance and took possession of the script. It is
not unnatural that " lily " should suggest Oscar Wilde to any
one who remembers the aesthetic movement Avith which he was
so much identified in the last quarter of the nineteenth century,
and the caricatures of it by Punch and Gilbert and Sullivan, etc.
But did it merely suggest hioi to the subliminal consciousness
of the automatist, or did the suggestion give Oscar Wilde
himself the opjjortunity of coming in ?
The script on that day (June 8th) proceeded in a style and
handwriting both of which more or less resembled Oscar Wilde's,
and contamed sentences if not exactly quoted from, at any
rate strongly reminiscent of, sentences in his writings. One of
these apparently came from a work Intentions which JVIr. V.
had not read but which Mrs. Travers Smith had. On the other
hand there is a sentence almost exactly reproducing one in a
letter of Mr. V.'s own—a letter descriptive of scenery—which he
had written some eight years previously, and which was recalled
to the memory of his correspondent and unearthed in con-
sequence of the pubUcation of this script (see III. p. 314).
This must, one supposes, have come from Mr. V.'s mmd,
though he had no conscious recollection of it.
1 On at least one occasion, however, Oct. 8th, 1923, when Miss Mac-
Gregor was his partner, he seems to have read the script during pauses
and asked questions (see II. pp. 274-6).
2 There is I think a difference, not easy to define, in tlie style of
communications obtained with the aid of three of the partners. The
fourth was Mrs. Travers Smith's daughter, who took her mother's place
in the middle of a sitting, with the result that the writing became very
large without other obvious change. For what is said in the scripts
about the relations of the two automatists, see below p. 194.
XCI.] Revleivs 189
Ten days later Mr. V., again with Mi-s. Travers Smith's
assistance, produced a second script which contamed, among
other things, sarcastic remarks about the S.P.R. m Oscar Wilde's
epigrammatic manner. The siibject was probably suggested
by the presence of our Research Officer, Mr. Dmgwall. After
this, begmning from that evening,^ Mi-s. Travers Smith obtained
frequent " Oscar Wilde " communications by herself—usmg an
ouija-board—an instrument with which she is a very expert
and rapid operator.
The general resemblance to Oscar Wilde's style is continued
in the communications received by Mrs. Travers Smith alone,
but they tend to be less spontaneous and more conversatiojial,
the subject bemg often suggested to begin with by the auto-
matist and changed by questions interposed.
Mrs. Travers Smith's book, which I have numbered I. above,
contams most though not all the scripts produced by Mr. V.
with her as partner and a large number of the ouija-board
communications received by her during the period in question.
These are followed by several chapters of analysis and dis-
cussion, pleasantly written, and givmg a popular account of
arguments for and against various theories concernuig the
intelhgence behmd the scripts.
In II. we have two long scripts produced by Mr. V. mth
the hand of Miss Helen MaoGregor (of the College of Psychic
Science) on his. These are perhaps the most interesting
scripts of the series. They are the most fully developed in
Kterary form, and they contain the most vivid and lurid
imagery m then account of the communicator's " sort of
amphibian " life "in the twihght of existences " with " a foot
in either world " but belonguig " properly to neither." The
existence of the communicator in twihght is, it may be remarked,
spoken of in several scripts, includmg the first, and is possil)ly
reminiscent of Oscar Wilde's account of his prison hie. The
two scripts in II. are accompanied by very interesting and
careful comment and discussion by Mr. V.'s brother.
This comment and discussion, but now covermg the whole of
Mr. V.'s script, is continued by his brother in III. This article,
1 This date is an inference based on internal evidence. It does not
,
quite agree with the dates given in the book, but this is probably due
to a misprint. There are several in the book.
190 Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick [part
after giving a list (with brief descriptions) of the scripts, is
divided into three sections. The first is a careful study of the
handwritmg, comj)aring it in detail with that of the living
Oscar Wilde. (Facsimiles of both are given.) There were
definite resemblances in the first script of the series, but their
number decidedly increased as time went on, becoming remark-
ably complete in the latest scri^Dts. This need not have
surj)rised us very much if Mr. V. had been familiar with the
handwriting, for to imitate (without cojiymg) a marked hand-
writing is apparently a not very difficult accomplishment even
when the imitation is carried on through many pages.^ But
the puzzle here is that Mx. V. is not aware of having ever
seen Oscar Wilde's handwriting before the first script was
written, and he did not afterwards see any tiU all the scripts
were written except a " Beheve me your sincere friend Oscar
Wilde " which appeared m the Occult Review in August 1923
—
that is about the middle of Mr. V.'s scriptic activities (III.
p. 305). Mrs. Travers Smith was also ignorant of the handwriting
when the first script came, but she made investigations, and
at the Chelsea Book Club (I think between the first script and
the second) sav/ " a facsimile of Wilde's writing " and " an
autograph letter of his " which " happened to be there for
sale " (I. p. 81). Whether the knowledge she had thus acquired
influenced the scripts at aU we cannot tell. Nor of course is
it possible to assert positively that—though they do not Ue
about m every book shop—^Mr. V. had never at some unknown
date himself accidentally come across an autograph letter of
Wilde's (or a reproduction of one) which, while making no
permanent impression on his conscious mind, remained imprmted
on his subhminal memory. However this may be the hand-
writing remains a very curious and interesting problem.
The second section of III. (pp. 305-315) deals with Oscar
Wilde's style, and compares that of the scripts with it. Space
forbids my going fully into this. I will only say that this
section will be found both interestmg and instructive. The
author is evidentlj^ very familiar with Wilde's witings and a
Mr. V.'.s brotlier has shown this as regards Oscar Wilde's handwriting
by experiments of Iiis own described in a letter to the Occult Review of
March 1924. And I have known of similar success in an experiment
with another liandwriting many years ago.
XCI.] Reviews 191
great admixer of them, and his articles wOl I thinly convince the
reader that there are many real Wildean traits in the script
though Little plagiarism after the first day. But, as we
should expect whether Oscar Wilde was himself concerned or
not, the imitation, though it improves, is not in Mr. V.'s
brother's opinion equally sustained throughout each script.
Remarkably characteristic of Wilde ui parts it is not apparently
unmixed Wilde. And as the exteiit to which style can be
successfully imitated is not only a matter about which opinions
differ, but one which is essentially indefinite, we cannot I
think through style alone obtain conclusive evidence as to
origin any more than we can through handwriting. This
section ends with a portion of the letter written by Mr. V.
himself in 191.5 to which I referred above, from which a phrase
is plagiarised or at least repeated in the first script, and which
shows a way of looking at scenery somewhat Wildean though
no doubt c|uite unconsciously so.
The third section of III. concerns the subject matter of the
scripts. It is pointed out that ideas and opinions are expressed
in the scripts—in some criticisms of modern authors for instance—
which are not Mr. V.'s ; and Mi's. Travers Smith says the same
for herself (see I. p. 110). Also that both by excess and
defect the general knowledge exhibited by the scripts does not
appear to coincide with that of Oscar Wilde in his lifetime.
We find in the scripts for instance a knowledge of wild flowers,
and again of the history of astronomy, both of which might
well have come from Ivlr. V.'s mind but of which there is no
appearance in W^ilde's writmgs. On the other hand Oscar
Wilde was " a very competent Greek scholar " and " often
adorned his prose with quotations from the Classics " while
the automatists knew but little of Greek. It accords with this
that no Greek quotations appear in the scripts, and that classical
allusions, even though " thoroughly characteristic of Wilde,"
seem to be all contained in The Iliad and The Odyssey, trans-
lations of which Mr. V. had read. On July 13th the script
gives a " remarkabl}^ accurate reproduction of a passage " from
Butcher and Lang's translation of The Iliad, read by Mr. V.
some years before. The script reads :
" On that wondrous
shield forged by Hephaestos for Achilles, on which was depicted
the whole of the life of man in its joy and sorrow, we are told
192 Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick [part
was wrought '
the earth and the sea and the unwearyhig sun,
the Pleiads and the Hyads and (her ?) that men call the Bear
who watches Orion, and alone hath no part in the baths of
Ocean.' " The passage in Butcher and Lang, evidently the
source of this, runs :
" Then wrought he the earth and the
heavens and the sea and the unwearying sun and the moon
waxing to the full and the Signs every one wherewith the
heavens are crowned, pleiads and hyads and Orion's might,
and the Bear that men call the Wain her that turneth in her
place and watcheth Orion, and alone hath no part in the baths
of Ocean." (See III. p. 316 and I. p. 59.)
Various allusions in the scripts are traced by his brother to
knowledge stored in Mr. V.'s mind as their probable or possible
source, but space will not allow me to dwell on these. We
must proceed to incidents in Oscar Wilde's life to which the
scripts refer.
The Oscar Wilde of the scripts, though he complained that
"it is so difficult to drag the past from memory's black cave,"
did on July 20th (see I. pp. 05-67) " descend for once into
the dull abyss of facts," and recounted some seven or eight
alleged incidents in his life. Mr. V.'s brother has been at
considerable pains to verify these, and has succeeded in doing so
in the majority of cases. But it is in five or six different books,
biographies of Wilde and others, that the evidence is found,
and with none of these was Mr. V. consciously acquainted.
More curious still, the way the incident is told in some cases
sufficiently resembles the account in the book Avhich furnishes
the verification to suggest that the book was the actual source
of the supposed memory. I will quote the strongest instance
of this. The script says :
—" Other memories . . . lunching with
Margot Tennant, Mrs. Fox, Blunt, and others in London—jioor
Asquith was hke a fish out of water, I did most of the talliing
—
and afterwards I told Margot stories—stayed behind." In My
Diaries, by Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, pp. 178-9, Mr. V.'s brother
finds the following entry (III. p. 322) " 17th July. A brilhant
luncheon with Margot and her husband at 30 Upper Grosvenor
Street . . . The other guests were Mrs. Grenfell, Mrs. Daisy
White, Ribblesdale, his brother Reggie Lister and Oscar Wilde.
All immensely talkative, so that it Avas almost like a breakfast
in France. Asquith alone rather out of it. 1 sat next him
XCI.] Reviews 193
and was rather sorry for him, though he was probably happy
enough. After the rest had gone away Oscar remained telling
stories to me and Margot." There are two mistakes in the
script—the lunch occurred after Miss Tennant's marriage to
Mr. Asquith and no Mrs. Fox appears to have been present.
The occurrence of the name Fox may possibly, a.s Mr. V.'s
brother pomts out, be due to confusion with another reminis-
cence which had just been spoken of ui which that name
should have occurred but did not.
Of course if documentary evidence of the reahty of an
incident cannot be found, the chances of being able to verify it
at this distance of time (Wilde died in 1900) would be rather
poor. It would be Avise therefore in furnishing evidence of
identity to choose uacidents of which there are printed accounts.
But are we to suppose that Wilde himself knew where to look -
in books pubhshed after his death for mcidents he could use ?
Or is it possible that the subUminal consciousness of one of
the automatists put them together from then- o^^Tl subUminal
store of memories picked up from reviews, or conversation, or
books casually glanced at, etc. ? Perhaps more light may yet
be obtamed on this cpaestion.
Before concluduig I will call attention to two curious con-
tradictions or uiconsistencies in the Wilde communications which
come to light by comparmg those pubhshed in I. and in II.
and which seem different from the kmd of confusion we might
expect owing to real communications passmg thi-ough the mmds
of different automatists and being contaminated by them. The
first inconsistency concerns the sensations experienced by " Oscar
Wilde " m entering the brain of living human beings.
In script of July 2nd (see I. pp. 17, 18), written by Mr. V.
with ]Virs. Travers Smith assisting, " Oscar Wilde " describes
how he has gazed thi'ough the eyes of others on the sights of
the world :
" Once on a pleasure steamer on its way to St.
(Jloud I saw the green waters of the Seine and the hghts of
Paris, through the vision of a httle girl who clung weepmg to
her mother and wondered why ... It may surprise you to learn
that in this way I have dipped into the works of your modern
novehsts. That is, I have not drawn the whole brew, but
tasted the vintage."
In the evening of the same day through the ouija-board—
1
194 Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick [part
Mr. v., of coiirse, not present
—" Oscar Wilde " says (I. pp. 20,
21): "I will go on and tell you how I have wandered into the
minds of the moderns, as you are pleased to call them. It
is a rather entertainmg process. I watch for my opportunity,
and Avhen the propitious moment comes I leap into their
minds and gather rapidly these impressions, which are largely
collective."
But in the scripts of September and October given in II., in
which Mrs. Travers Smith did not take part, the same process
is spoken of in a much less light-hearted way. In these scripts
" Oscar Wilde " seems to describe his existence as consisting
largely of successive brief occupation of different human
organisms, and says :
" It is a strange thing, this birth
into a new brain. You may analyse it or dissect it as a
scientific curiosity, but for us who hang in fearful poise twixt
the daylight and the dark it is an experience no less terrible
than strange, and one which repetition cannot rob of its terrors.
By some central mystery of existence Life's oldest pangs must
accompany Life's newest creations " (II. p. 271).
The second inconsistency concerns the share in the work of
the two automatists. At the ouija-board on June 18 (see I.
p. 13) " Oscar Wilde " was asked :
" Who did you communicate
through at the sitting for automatic writing this afternoon ?
Through Mr. V., or through Mrs. Travers Smith ?
" He
replied :
" Through you dear lady. He is a tool. You are
the hght that lets me peep again into the world that seems so
dazzling, now that the Divine Justice finds it His pleasure to
keep me m dim twihght."
And again through the ouija-board on July 2 (see I. pp.
21, 22) when asked :
" How do you manage when Mr. V. and
I are together." He replies :
" I can control his hand, I can
only control your mind. Your hand is guided by your mind."
And again on July 5th, when asked by Mrs. Travers Smith
why he selected her as his medium, he gave an answer too
long to quote here, but in the course of it said (I. pp. 35, 36) :
" I tried many times to secure a vial for my ideas . . . But
until the day when I seized the pencil from some unnoticeable
being, who seemed to make an effort to press through the
brain of '
the tool '
never before had I found the exact quality
I needed ... I can use the hand of the tool. . . . But his brainy
XCI.] Reviews 195
does not serve me. I cannot use it, for ideas would stick
there as flies do in a cloyed mass."
What has been said in the course of this review about the
use in the scripts of material in Mr. V.'s mind is in itself a
sufficient disproof of this account of the matter. But, farther,
these ouija-board statements are flatly contradicted in a script
written by Mr. V. with Mrs. Travers Smith as his partner on
July 20th, 1923. In a part of this script not included in Mrs.
Travers Smith's book, but published in the Sunday Ex-press of
August 5th, 1923, the following sentences occur and have
been copied for me :
" Oscar Wilde ... It is through your
temperament that I am al)le to give my thoughts to tlie world.
You have that curious combination of the literary and scientific
temperament which creates a sort of psychic aftlruty with
myself. It is true that one of the ladies here supplies a
certain motive force—just as an electric machine must have its
'
starters '
or whatever one may call them. But these are
merely the accessories and the accessories are not the machine.
Tlie machine I use is your human temperament. So please
remember that there is only one Oscar Wdde and that you
are his prophet."
Nor is this all, for it does not seem possible to reconcile
either the ouija-board statements or the script .
just quoted with
the following curious statements made in the script of October
8th when Mr. V. wrote with Miss MacGregor as a partner (II.
p. 275). " Oscar Wilde " had been speaking of his experiences
when attached to different brains, and Mr. V. asked :
" To whose
brain are you attached at present ? Ansicer : To your
own. Question : How is it you are able to communicate
through Mrs. Travers Smith if, as you say, you are imprisoned
in my brain ? Answer : That is most probably another part
of myself, a poor fellow-unfortunate who suffers even as I
suffer. Question' : What do you mean ? Surely there are not
two Oscar Wildes ? Answer : Does that cause you to wonder ?
Yes, it reaUy is so. Quite possibly our name is legion. The
soul is no indivisible iinity, no solitary shadow seated in its
house of sin. It is a thmg, highly complex, built up, layer
upon layer . . ., etc."
It will be remembered that two of our ex-presidents in their
presidential addresses—Mr. Gerald Balfour in 1906 [Proceedings,
19b Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick [part
Vol. XIX.), and Dr. McDoiigall in 1920 {Proceedings, Vol. XXXI.)
—suggested that we are in this world polypsychic beings, and
Mr. McDougall discussed this hypothesis in some detail. Mr.
v., however, has no recollection of having read, or thought
about this hypothesis, and the subordinate personahties are
not I think conceived by either Mr. Balfour or Mr. McDougall
as continuing after death a separate and independent existence
in which they can masquerade as the dominant personality
wliile they Uve in the hope of some day being reunited to it
as the Oscar Wilde of the script of October 8th professes to do.
" I yearn," he says, " to be united to my soul. Somewhen
and somewhere I must surely meet my soul again. That is
my little taper of hope in infinite darkness."
But my paper is already too long, and I think I have said
enough to justify what I remarked at the beginning, namely that
these scripts raise problems rather than solve them. For myself |
I find it impossible to decide on the evidence before us whether
it is most probable, or should we say least improbable, that
we have here to do with an extraordinarily full development of
subliminal power both as regards imagination, dramatisation
and memory, or on the other hand with some distorted element
of Oscar Wilde inspiring the scripts. Or, again, is it conceivable
that there is some kind of combination of the two. I believe
that Mr. V. and his brother are in the same attitude of
complete suspense of judgment as myself, while Mrs. Travers
Smith, if I understand her rightly, inclines to the spiritualistic
hypothesis. But both those who feel able to come to a con-
clusion and those who do not will agree that we have here an
important addition to our knowledge of facts concerning
automatism.

Problems of Belief. By F. C. S. Schiller, D.Sc. "Library
of Philosophy and Religion." (Hodder & Stoughton.
1924. Price 3s. 6d. net.)
No one can have followed, even sjooradically and unprofession-
ally, the controversies of the last forty years without perceiving
the crisis through which philosophy and religion are passing.
The questions raised are " Can any philosophy be true t Is any
i
XCI.] Reviews 197
religion true '? " and the answers seem to be in the negative to
both questions. Mr. Schiller, no doubt, would quarrel with this
statement and retort
—" What do you mean by true ?
" involv-
ing one at once in the whole controversy about " pragmatism."
On that ground, so far as it is a question of logic, he has
nothing new to advance. But if a reader prefers to consider
the way in which men do, in fact, arrive at then- conclusions,
he will find this book full of interest. Sometimes the human
mind will seem merely grotesque or mad, as in the account of
Jeremiah, the Indian chief, who conducted three times a day,
for a naked congregation, a service which consisted in repeating
ten times over the English alphabet and the numbers from one
to ten. Sometimes it will a.ppear dishonest, sometimes confused,
sometimes pitifully inadequate ;
with, always, that little lamp
of what we call reason floating so desolately on so vast a sea
of instmcts, desires, hopes, fears, passions, cupidities, necessities.
And he will be a bold or an uiiimagmative man, Avho is not
constrained to say m the end : There, but for the Grace of
God, go I."
The analysis and classification of all this chaos of beliefs
is a principal object and achievement of this little book.
But it has other piirposes. One, perhaps too promuient, is a
further attack on those forms of ideahsm agamst which Mr.
Schiller has so long been tilting. Possibly residence in Oxford
has made him exaggerate the importance of these would-
be rational philosophies. Perhaps too, in his controversial zeal,
he neglects the real qualities of some of the men he attacks.
The present reviewer, at any rate, when he thinks of Plato
and Spinoza and even Hegel does not feel them to be the
merely ridiculous or dishonest figures that they are apt to
appear in Mr. Schiller's polemics. That, no doubt, is because
philosophers of that kmd are also poets ; and one does not
laugh at or quarrel with Dante because one does not accept
his theology. But that by the way, for it is not, hi this book,
the important pomt.
The important point is Mr. SchiUer's insistence on the real
character of the beliefs that may claim to be scientific ; how
relative, how tentative, how modest they are, m the minds of
their best exponents. And since it is here, if anywhere, that
the possibility of human progress lies, the service done is a
108 Cr. Lowes Dickinson [part
real one. Science has to steer its way betAveen credulity and
scepticism ; and how arduous that tasit is those l^est know who
have tried to perforin it.
Perhajjs the most important of Mr. Schiller's points is the
one he makes about the connection of belief with action.
Can you be said, really, to believe anything, unless you are
prepared to act upon it ? Broadly, and admitting qualifica-
tions, Mr. Schiller says " No." And certainly for the truths
of morals, action is a real and searching test, the candid
application of which must make most of us feel uncomfortable.
Moral genius implies the power of living the beliefs that
are professed. But it implies also that the beliefs shall be
" true." In what sense ? Mr. Schiller would like to reply,
and does in great part reply, in the sense that they tend to
survival. Clearly, however, they do not tend to the survival
of the genius who propounds them ; or Socrates would not
have been heralocked, nor Jesus crucified. It may be said,
however, that they tend to stu vive in others ;
and, if not, they
are false. But something hi us certainly rebels against this
doctrine. We remember " si fractus illabatur orbis, Impavidum
ferient ruinae " ; whicli brings one quickly to the question of
o])timism and pessimism ; for it is optimism that assumes
that the true valuations survive, and pessimism that holds the
contrary. This question of ojitimism and pessimism Mi'.
Schiller discusses ;
concluding apparently that it is an open
question, and that there is a fair choice between the alter-
natives. If uideed the pessimists shoAA'ed signs of being extin-
guished, he seems to think that then- doctrine would be false.
But in fact they survive. So, by that test, pessimism might be
" true." Anyhow Mr. Schiller is himself enough of a pessimist
to hold that optimism requires the admixture of a good deal
of pessimism before it becomes anything but frivolous. " Sur-
vival " does not helj) to conclusions about truth in this case,
nor yet in other dilemmas, such as that of determinism or free
will. Mr. Schiller says that, in such cases, we can and should
choose, and ovu- choice may affect the course of the wox'ld,
however faintly. Perhaps. But all this seems to be a hazardous
skating over the jjrecarious smiace of our dangerous world.
There comes a pomt, in these discussions, at which si:)eech
seems inadequate, unless it be the speech of poets or sauits.
XCI.] Reviews 199
But it is not always, or commoiily, that we are effectively
brought up against such issues. And for the issues of common
life Mr. Schiller has indicated very fruitfully, both how men
do form behefs, and how they should form them.
One of the questions he touches on is of peculiar interest to
the iS.P.R., for it is the question of survival after death.
Many years ago, as is well known to the older members of the
society, Mr. Schiller and Mr. Hodgson sent out a question-
naire enquuing what the recipients believed, hoped, feared,
and so on, about that problem. The replies, some of which
are quoted here, showed great diversity of opinion and much
reluctance to attempt to pursue the question in a scientific way.
This reluctance most people must have come across, and it
seems to be due partly to disbelief in there being any method
of enquiry, partly to a desire to beheve, or disbelieve, what one
wants. Mr. Schiller discusses the reasons for this attitude
and concludes that they are serious obstacles in. the path of
enquiry. " I have not yet despaired," he concludes, " of the
S.P.R., but I realise that its path lies through a terrible
complex of conflicthig emotions." When to this is added the
difficulty that people are almost ine\dtably either unduly
credulous or unduly sceptical, and that it is very hard to know
what degree of either quality is really " scientific," the obstacles
to the work of the Society seem formidable. But w-e have no
right to pronounce them insuperable, and it ^^'ould be very
" unpragmatic " to do so.

MaJcing of Man; a Study in Evolution. By Sir Oliver Lodge,
F.R.S (Pp. Lx +185. Hodder and Stoughton. 6s.)
In this book Sir Oliver Lodge discusses the Evolution and
Destiny of man from a somewhat novel standpoint. Realising
to the full the achievements of physical science, and in no
way underestimating the rigidity of its demonstrations, he
none the less considers that there is ample place for a super-
physical order of reality—a reality distinguished from that
with which jihysicists normally deal by permanence and im-
munity from decay. This order of existence he associates with
the Ether as opposed to Matter, though he considers that
200 W. Whately Smith
interaction between the two may and, indeed, habitually does
take place.
An original and interesting view is developed in the second
chapter, " The Effort of Evolution," where Sir Oliver com-
pares Evil with " inertia "—a fundamental property of matter
—
pointing out that although effort implies a resistance, that
resistance need not necessarily be active—it is not necessary
to postulate an Evil Force deliberately opposing our strivings
towards perfection—for the opposition encountered may be
merely analogous to that experienced in acceleratmg a mass to
the required state of motion.
In a later chapter the same concej^tion dominates the
discussion of " The Best of All Possible Worlds," in which the
view is advanced that given the conditions under which
the Universe was in fact evolved the World is as perfect as
is possible. Another corollary is an approximation to that idea of
the nature of the Deity of which the Rev. Studdert Kennedy
is j^erhaps the most notable exponent in ecclesiastical circles.
According to this view God is represented not as Omnipotent
and Omnisicient Being who, for inscrutable reasons, elects
to permit the existence of Evil, but rather as a beneficent
Power demanding and needing our cooperation in combating
it—or as Sir Oliver would say—in overcoming the inherent
inertia of the Universe.
The book is, in fact, full of suggestive passages of which
the above are but samples taken almost at random and is
certain to appeal to many who, while unwilling to violate
the established conclusions of physical science, still feel the
need for behef in possibihties transcendent thereto.

IN MEMORIAM—GUSTAVE GELEY.
1868-1924.
By Sir Oliver Lodge.
The sudden and untov/a.rd calamity which has removed
from us an indefatigable and devoted worker in meta-
psychic science calls for an ai^preciation of his personality
as well as of his work. Dr. Geley is not well known in
this country : I doubt if he is well known personally in
any country except in France and Poland ;
for, whether
through overwork or through a habit of concentrated
thinking, there was an outer husk to break through,
before one came upon the man himself. The first time
I saw him v/as at Mariemont, Edgbaston, in 1919, when,
in company with Mr. Stanley de Brath, he called upon me
unexpectedly one afternoon during what was at that time
an infrequent, perhaps exceptional, visit to England. I
too was very busy at the time ; and though he brought
a letter of introduction from my friend Charles Richet,
calculated to predispose me in his favour, I found him
rather reserved and difficile. Very hkely he got the same
impression of me ; and I was by no means as hospitable
as I v/ould now like to have been. Doubtless the diffi-
202 Sir Oliver Lodge [part
culty of language and of nationality is partly responsible ;
but something of the same kind was felt at first by
others whose control of language was much superior to
my own. Later, during several visits to France, I got
to know him and his family, and, with the friendly
assistance of Madame Geley, felt that I knew him better,
and established the beginning of a friendship. Moreover,
I met at his house some delightful people, and realised
the importance of his life and mission.
He was a philosophic thinker of no small magnitude.
His physiological and medical training gave him many^
advantages, he was well read in the writings of philoso-
phers who had dealt with the relations between the
conscious and the unconscious, and he had made a special
j
study of the views of M. Bergson.
His best known book, De Ulnconscient au Conscient}
aroused the attention of many in France. In it he tried
to deal with the philosophy and rationale of psycho-
physical phenomena in general, and it may be regarded
as the most important treatise on that aspect of the
subject since F. W. H. Myers's great and more comprehen-
sive work. Moreover, Geley had the advantage of being
better acquainted with physiological phenomena (which are
evidently of vital importance in supernormal psychology)
than even Myers was. And whether his views hold their
ground, whether they really form the initial chapter of a
new science, or whether they are destined to be replaced
as well as supplemented,—questions which cannot be
lightly or quickly decided,—they are certainly based on an
apj)rehension of ectoplasmic phenomena, some personally
apprehended, some collated from the experience of others,
which, as far as I know, is without a parallel. Had he
lived there seemed every prospect of our learning a great
deal more through his indefatigable work amid the oppor-
tunities which friends of the subject had provided, and of
which, with rare self-sacrifice (comparable with that of
Richard Hodgson), he availed himself to the uttermost.

Unconscious to the Conscious (Collins.)
xcii.] In Memoriam—Gustave Oeley 203
In addition to his own contemplation and study of
the subject he patiently devoted a great part of his time
to the convincing of others, especially of his medical con-
freres, or the few who would allow themselves to be
subjected to a demonstration, through first-hand experience,
of the reality of the supernormal physiological phenomena,
which had long attracted the attention and overborne the
scepticism of Richet, Schrenck Notzing, Osty, and others.
Gustave Geley—killed by the crash of an aeroplane
as he was leaving Warsaw for Paris on the 15th
of July 1924—was born in 1868 at Montceau-les-Mines.
He studied in the hospitals of Lyons (where incidentally
he obtained the first prize from the Faculty of Medicine
for his thesis), and then established himself as a medical
practitioner at Annecy, being at an early age specially
attracted by the study of metapsychic phenomena. His
first book was virtually on the origin of species, or what
was called in France (and occasionally by Huxley) " Trans-
formisme;' to express capacity for racial change, Les
Preuves du Transformisme, with a sub-title Enseignements
de la Doctrijie Evolutionniste, in which he criticised the
doctrmes both of Darwin and of Lamarck, and argued for
an element of guidance or plan as necessary to account
for the origin of variations. In his second book, UEtre
Subconscient (published in 1899), he attempted a syn-
thetic explanation of obscure phenomena m normal biology
as well as in abnormal psychology, and broached his
doctrine of what he called " dynamo psychism,"—a sort of
soul-energy akin to the elan vitale, and not very different
perhaps from the conceptions, otherwise arrived at by
ancient writers, of entdechy, and the Logos. This con-
ception of dynamo psychism was fundamental in Geley's
scheme, and in his mind took the form of a vitahstic
theory which sought to escape from the trammels of
materiaUstic philosophy through what may be treated in
a wide sense as the interaction of soul and body, or,
more generally, a dynamic power of the mental '
and
spuritual regions competent to control, guide, and rearrange
I atoms of matter. The fact of such control is famihar in
204 Sir Oliver Lodge [part
the bodily processes of digestion and the like, carried on with
a definite object or on a definite plan, but quite uncon-
sciously ; and of these normal analogies he makes full use.
This book attracted some attention, but not till 1920
did it develop into a more comprehensive treatise, the
outcome probably of a philosophy which was no longer
satisfied with the duality inseparable from the usual idea
of interaction, but was seeking for a unification of the
two main aspects of the universe by postulating a passage
or development or evolution of one into the other,—the
gradual growth of the conscious at the expense of the
unconscious,—somewhat perhaps as is suggested by De
Morgan's title From Hatter to Spirit. Geley's thesis, how-
ever is purely biological, it does not deal with the non-
living, it trealts of the gradual unfoldmg or emergence of
consciousness out of subconscious or unconscious life^
In this work {De Ulnconscient au Conscient) Geley
traces many analogies in the animal kingdom, where from
a formless mass of protoplasm a full-fledged seK-determm-
ino- and in some sense conscious or ultimately conscious,
orSknism is gradually elaborated. From the formless pulp
of the chrysahs, in which all the organs except the nervous
system of the larva have completely disappeared, bio-
logists odmit that Hmbs and organs are reconstituted,
under the guiding influence of " Life "-a term which here
at any rate must be left vague,—operating apparently
through the residual trace of nervous mechanism, until a
fully ^developed insect appears, with characteristics quite
different from those of the larva, though doubtless to
some extent foreshadowed by them in rudimentary and
barely recognisable form. From an egg again, which is
mairly a mass of unorganised food material, isolated
from "all external influence save the random molecular
agitation which we call heat,—yet which must contain a
microscopic germinal vesicle, the nucleus and container or
vehicle of the vital principle,—a bkd emerges, completely
constructed and able to function in every detail, with an
inteUigence enabluig it to stand erect, to move, to see,
and intentionally seek its food.
In analogies such as these, and by appeal to the pheno-
XCII.] In Memoriam—Gusfuve Geley 205
mena of reproduction generally, whether in association
with a placenta or otherwise, Geley and others are seeking
to rationalise the strange jphenomena exhibited by ecto-
plasm—the reality of which is testified to also by Prof.
Richet, who gave it its name,—from which there appears
to be quickly formed a temporary living organism, having
inevitably some of the main characteristics of the pre-
existing normal organism whence the ectoplasm must
have been derived. In beginning the study of such
temporary formations, controlled by intelMgence and yet
arising out of apparently formless pulp, we seem at first
to be in the region of the frankly incredible, certamly of
the plainly mysterious. But biological analogies, which
are undeniable though equally mysterious, may serve to
mitigate our initial increduUty, and enable us more placidly
to contemplate, and perhaps accept gradually and circum-
spectly, the strong and repeated evidence for the existence
of such thiags, which from time to time is forthcommg.
For these apparitions or simulacra, or whatever they
may be called, are able to make an appeal to our senses ;
not only to the sense of sight, but the sense of touch, and
the muscular sense also. They are visible, they are some-
times tangible, and they can exert force on matter ;
they
simulate human bodies or limbs. Indeed the analogy of
our own bodies may be pressed into the service ; for these
too are constructed by the vital principle out of materials
which, whatever their previous history, are first reduced
by the processes of mastication and digestion to a form-
less pulp or even to thek molecular constituents. Yet
under the mysterious guidance of Life, each portion of
food or assemblage of molecules, when it arrives at its
destination, is there converted into the organ or structure
appropriate to that particular locaHty, forming here a skin,
there a hair, here again a blood-vessel, or a part of some
internal organ ;
filling up artificially made cavities, such
as wounds, to the proper level, and, under healthy con-
ditions, stopping there without going beyond the normal
limits ; in some of the lower organisms actually replacing
lost limbs, or even reconstructing a whole amputated
body ; so that by section it is possible to get two animals
206 Sir Oliver Lodge [part
where only one existed before. In vegetable life the
process is still more familiar, as when the mere cutting
from a tree reproduces not only the tree, but flowers and
fruit and innumerable descendants.
To those who would study the operations of Life,
whether as displayed by mediums in the laboratory or by
organisms in the field, all these things have to be taken
into account. And we shall presently find that one class
of phenomena is no more incredible than any other, but
that every class must be examined and verified, and the
laws of its being gradually ascertained. There is much
work to be done, and Geley was on the track. Fortun-
ately a few biologists are waking up to the importance and
interest, not only of normal, but what appear now to be
supernormal phenomena : and in the course of a few gener-
ations we may hope, not for a full understanding—for
that must be far distant—but for a clearer comprehension
and more active receptivity of all responsibly vouched for
occurrences, not only in the chemical and physical and
biological, but in the psycho-physical direction as well.
For the boundary between the normal and the super-
normal shows signs of breaking down. We are beginning
to get a glimpse of a continuity running through the
whole of animate nature. The interaction of mind and
body is attracting more attention than ever before,
and in due time Philosophy may succeed in its great and
difficult and perennial task of unifying the vital and the
material, and realising that the ultimate clue is to be
found not in the material and transient but in those
permanent realities which appeal to us as Life and Mind.
But to return to Geley the man. In 1918 the Institut
Metapsychique Internationale was founded by the munifi-
cence of M. Jean Meyer, and was established by him at
89 Avenue Niel, Paris ; and Geley was invited to become
its first Director.^ This involved his abandoning his

medical practice and prospects of success in his profession,
and entering upon an arduous and unpopular task, which
he must have known would subject him to a painful
amount of ridicule and hostility. Even in this country-
such a step would be a sacrifice ;
although here, through
the exemplary and cautious labours of Sidgwick, Myers,
Gurney, not to mention such of the founders of the S.P.R.
as are still hving, the ground has been to some extent
prepared ; the hostility of the press, of the scientific
world, and of theologians, has been, not indeed removed,
but to some degree restrained or mitigated. In France,
however, it must be conceded that both among clerics and
among professional men hostility is rampant, though the
eminence of some of the workers is such as to render
them more or less immune from personal attacks. Geley
was not immune. His standing in normal and medical
science was not such as to curb the fiercest kind of
criticism. Scientific men in this country, as elsewhere,
have been accused of a kind of insanity, over credulity,
mal-observation, and the hke ; but Geley was accused, not
so much of those things, or not only of those, but of
downright fraud and deceitful co-operation ; in other words,
he was accused of being an accomplice and a liar.
Older members of the Society for Psychical Research
will remember that it was Henry Sidgwick's ambition to
make the evidence so strong that this accusation of com-
phcity would be the only one left to opponents. He
could well afford to take that line ; for his transparent
honesty was such that accusations of that kind, in his
case, would have been preposterous. But a comparatively
unlmown and junior man could hardly suffer such accusa-
tions without pain ; and to rebut such scandal Geley con-
sented to have his premises examined for secret doors and
the like, and to being chained up along with other investi-
gators,—himself as well as the medium being subject
mette, Medical Inspector-General (France) ; Professor Bozzano (Italy) ;
Professor Cuneo ; the veteran astronomer Camille Flammarion ; Count
de Gramont of the French Academy ; M. Jules Roche ; M. Gabriel j;De-

psychique, is published by the Institut.

to control. In the interests of truth, all these things
were submitted to ; and a v/hole year of work was de-
voted for the most part to convincing doctors and pub-
licists and men of science that under the most rigid
scrutiny and complete control of everybody present,
normally inexplicable phenomena actually occurred. That
at least was the aim. Whether it was accomplished or
not, is not a matter for assertion. Some were convinced,
others were not : each must speak for himself.
It may be argued that the effort to convince people
against their v/ill is neither necessary nor mse. It may
be argued on the other hand that the asserter of strange
and apparently unwelcome truth is bound to make the
attempt. Crookes made the attempt, and failed. But
many things have happened since the seventies of last
centur5^ Geley made the attempt, and partially suc-
ceeded ; the most stringent evidence that he has been
able to produce—evidence from which it is difficult to see
any loophole for escape—being the casts of hands and
other hmbs, but mainly of hands, which he obtained at
Warsaw through the unpaid mediumship of Franek Kluski.
I use the term " unpaid " because it was so, not because
that is a matter of ?^ny importance. Precautions are just
as necessary in one case as in another ; and remuneration
is perfectly reasonable if a medium is wiUing to accept it.
Kluski, though a manual worker, was not.
The jjaraffin gloves from which these casts were made,
considered in conjunction with the conditions under which
they were produced and the crucial tests made to ensure
their genuineness, are a standing demonstration of some-
thing inexphcable by normal science ;
they constitute the
kind of demonstrative evidence which Zolhier, long ago,
and many others have sought, without success ; a per-
manent material record, which can be examined at leisure,
and which,^—given ascertainable and recorded conditions,
—
are, as it were, a standing miracle. These casts repose
on the shelves of a cabinet in the Institut Metapsychique,
and this is not the place to describe them. They repre-
sent or tyi^ify the material side of Geley's achievements :
his books represent the other side. ...
XCII.] In Memoriam—Gtistave Geley 209
The last book he wrote was an account of these and
other experiments conducted at the Institut, or in other
countries with the Institut as base. Under the title
L'Ectoplasmie et la Clairvoyance, it narrates experiments
establishing his assurance of the genuineness of meta-
psychic phenomena. The book has only just appeared ;
and I hope that a translation will be forthcoming through
the industry of ]\Ir. Stanley de Brath, whose friendship
with the a;Uthor, and whose close acquaintance with his
work, will certainly make it a labour of love.
On the note of friendship and personal appreciation I
propose to conclude this notice. In answer to my en-
quiries, one of my daughters, who a year ago was kindly
invited by the Geley family to pay them a long visit, has
sent me the following personal information :
—
" Dr. Geley was quiet and difficult to understand, but
always felt friendly and kind. He v/orked much too hard :
it seemed as if he was always writing in his study or
holding a seance. These sittings seemed to take it out of
him, giving him a tired look, and making him rather
abrupt in his manner ; he was so conscientious about them,
and worried if sceptics went away still sceptical. At
meals he was never too tired to be thoughtful enough to
talk slowly and carefully whenever he spoke to me, so
that I should understand. There seemed but httle peace
for him. His heart was in his work, and he showed
great dehght when any important person obtained favour-
able and impressive results. Very often he would sit
silent, apparently immersed in thought. Madame Geley
of course managed everything in the house : and the
family hfe was peaceful and affectionate."
As showing the estimation in which Geley was held by
his friends and co-workers, I shall here translate or
paraphrase from a panegyric in La Revue Spirite a few
passages which speak for themselves :
—
" What we would speak of, we who have known
and loved him, is his magnificent inteUigence coupled
with high scientific conscientiousness ; also his exem-
plary simplicity, his rare faculty of reconciling the
210 8ir Oliver Lodge [part
enthusiasm of the investigator with the reflective
wisdom of the savant and philosopher ;
finally, and
above all, his charity which extended itself unmeasured
to his most sceptical adversaries. . . . Serenely he
persevered in his honest task, remaining indifferent
to attacks, seeking only one end, to which he was
valiantly devoted : namely, the advancement of the
status of a subject, of which the principles are already
indisputable, and which he sought to raise above the
cloud of suspicion in which it had too long been
enveloped and hampered by the negation of orthodox
materiaHstic science. He knew that time was on
his side and that by slow but sure increments his hypo-
thesis in some form would gradually become certainty.
His faith equalled his courage. He saw opening before
him a long stretch of life. He preserved that quiet
faith which sustains and guides all the great leaders,
he pressed forward in spite of obstacles, towards the
goal ;
striving only to bring about, one day, this
victory, towards which the advances are better and
securer when gradually and cautiously made. He
felt assured that the barriers would yield, one by one,
to persuasive pressure before the evidence of facts,
without any necessity for using violence ;
although
nevertheless violence was employed against him by
adversaries who doubtless felt that their ground was
beginning to shake under them.
" This achievement was for him the mission of the
future—of his future. He is no longer among us.
The torch has slipped from his fingers. Those who
hereafter carry on the interrupted work will not find
in the history of Truths courageously conquered a
finer example than that of Gustave Geley.
" For VIS spiritists, Gustave Geley is not dead. . . .
He falls, but his spirit rises. An active worker for
truth while on the earth, he will remain the same,
in the luminous regions which he has entered, without '
surprise, and where he has reopened his eyes on a
vaster vision. His mission has entered on a more
active phase.
XCII.] In Memc/riam—Oustave Geley 211
" If this conviction can be any alleviation to the
grief of his wife and children and many friends, we
may bless once more the knowledge which enables
us to mingle with our tears the vivifying promise
of future reunion."
To this tribute M. Jean Meyer adds a touching note of
remembrance and sympathy, speaking of the admiration
and regret which he feels for " this great savant and
benefactor of humanity, who lived only for the advance-
ment of his nascent science." " His work remains : it is
founded on a rock, and will be continued m the same
spirit. . . . He left the earth in that fragile aeroplane, his
eyes fixed on the heavens whence he came, . . . his great
soul will continue to inspire the strictly scientific work of
the Institut."

REPORT ON FURTHER EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-
TRANSFERENCE CARRIED OUT BY PROFESSOR
GILBERT MURRAY, LL.D., Litt.D.i
By Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.
Professor Gilbert Murray's experiments in Thought-
transference are perhaps the most important ever brought
to the notice of the Society, both on account of their
frequently brilhant success and on account of the eminence
of the experimenter. It is surprising, I think, that they
have not attracted more general attention than, so far as
I know, they have. All persons, however, who remember
his interesting Presidential address in 1915 (see Proceedings,
vol. xxix., p. 46), in which he gave an account of the
experiments, or have read the report by Mrs. Verrall on
the 504 experiments then before her (see the same volume,
p. 64), will rejoice to hear that Professor Murray has not
ceased experimenting, and will welcome the opportunity
of studying the further series, comprising 259 experiments,
which he has now submitted to us. I should Hke to
say first that though I win try to make the present report
intelhgible by itself, all who really wish to study the
subject should also read the above-mentioned papers.
As, however, we have probably not all of us got either
the Presidential address, or Mrs. Verrall's report fuUy in
our minds at the moment, I will quote Professor Murray's
brief account of the method of procedure. He says :
{Proc. vol. xxix., p. 58.)
The method followed is this : I go out of the room and of
course out of earshot. Someone in tlie room, generally my
eldest daughter, thinks of a scene or an incident or anything
she likes, and says it aloud. It is written down, and I am
called. I come in, usually take my daughter's hand, and then,
1 This paper was read at a General Meeting of the Society on
December 12, 1924.
xciT.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 213
if I have luck, describe in detail what she has thought of. The
least disturbance of our customary method, change of time or
place, presence of strangers, controversy, and especially noise,
is apt to make things go wrong. I become myself somewhat
over-sensitive and irritable, though not, I believe, to a
noticeable degree.
^
Mrs. Verrall, who was herself present on one occasion,
gives a somewhat fuller account of the method (pp. 64, 65).
As to the way he gets his impression, Professor Murray
says (same page, above) :
When I am getting at the thing which I wish to discover
the, only effort I make is a sort of effort of attention of a
quite general kind. The thing may come through practically
any sense-channel, or it may discover a road of its own, a
chain of reasoning or of association, which, as far as I remember,
never comcides with any similar chain in the mind of anyone
present, but is invented, much as a hallucination is invented,
for the purpose of the moment.
I have not myself had the advantage of witnessing any
of the experiments, but Mr. Gerald Balfour was present
one evening, August 26, 1916, and though the success on
this occasion was somewhat below the average, it will
give a good idea of the experiments if I quote the notes of
this sitting in full, and a brief note by Mr. Balfour as to

Lady Mary Murray (Professor Murray's wife), his daughters
Mis. Arnold Toynbee and Miss Agnes Murray, his son Mr.
Ba^il Murray, Mr. Arnold Toynbee, and Mr. BaKour, and Miss
Blomfield taking notes. On this, as on aU other occasions,
all in the room were aware of the subject selected for
1 The " subject " is written down, from the words of the agent, by
the note-taker, who keeps it in her hand and writes on the same sheet
of paper the remarks made by Professor Murray, etc. As the note-
taker faces Professor Murray after he enters the room it is difficult
to conceive any unconscious reading of the notes by him as has
been suggested by one critic. I may add that it is written so
quickly, and often in such faint pencil, that in studying the records
for the purposes of this paper I have sometimes found them quite
difficult to decipher, and have at times used a magnifying glass
with advantage.

transmission ; and all were, or may have been, agents in
the transmission ; but I shall use the word " agent " for
the principal agent—the person responsible for the subject
and to whom Professor Murray attends. In what follows
remarks by the agent and contemporary notes are in
round brackets ; additions by myself, to make things
clear, in square brackets.
1. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent): "I think of the
beginning of a [story by] Dostoievsky where the dog of a poor
old man [is] dying in a restaurant."
Professor Murray. " I think it's a thing in a book. I
should think a Russian book. A very miserable old
man, and I think he's doing something with a dead dog.
[A] very unhappy one. I rather think it is in a restaurant
and people are mocking, and then they are sorry and
want to be kind. I am not sure." (" Nationality ? ")
" No—I don't get their nationality. I have a feeling
it is a sort of Gorki thing. I have a feeUng that it is
something Russian."
([Mrs. ToynbeeJ had not said it but it was aU true. Mr.
Murray had not read the book. It was a German restaurant,
but Mr. Mixrray had not felt that.)^
2. Subject {suggested by Mr. Balfour). Mrs. Arnold ToY!N-
BEE (agent): "As he [Mr. Balfour] v.'as coming up the road he
was thinking :
—The shade of Nelson watching the funeral pro-
cession of the Duke of Wellington at St. Paul's Cathedral."
Professor Murray. " This is not your own. No, I'm aer^
getting it. I think it is Mr. Balfour['s]. I [am] onij'
getting you [Mr. Balfour,] walking up the road. No,
I'm not getting it."
3. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" I think of a
thing in Burnt Njal where Njal and his sons are burnt in his
house, and [the enemy and] his sons come up and set fire to
the house."
^ This " subject," but perliaps a slightly later stage of it, had
been successfully tried by the same agent four months earlier, on April
23, 1916. See Appendix, No. 53. ,

Proitessob Mtjbray :
" I don't think I shall get this. No,

4. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" I think of
Helena Cornford and Tony grown uji, walking beside the river
at Cambridge."
Peofessoe Mtjbeay. " This is not a book. It's got a sort
of Cambridge feel in it. It's the Cornfords somehow.
—
No—it's a girl walking beside the river, but it isn't
Frances [JVIrs. Cornford]. Oh ! is it baby Cornford grown
up ? Ought I to know what she is doing ? " (" Who
she is with "). " No, I don't get who she is with—No—
I should only be guessing." (Every one " go on ").
No. I should only think of another baby grown up
—
Tony [a small grandchUd]."
5. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) : "I think of
the Australians leaving GaUipoli and one man gomg back that
wouldn't leave."
(Tohu-bohu, [noise of] running about, having baths.)
Professor Murray. " No."
6. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) : "I think of a
scene in [Hardy's] Tess [of the Durbervilles] where she is open-
ing a letter, rather near the end, sitting by the fire."
(
[A] maid [moving] about all the time).
Professor Murray. " This is a book—It's a sort of country
milkmaid atmosphere very sad. I don't think it is Marie
Claire. Oh, I think it is Tess—No I can't get it—can't
quite—I think it is late on when the horrid religious
man has come back. It is not one of the early idyllic
scenes."
(Mrs. Toynbee. " [I] was thinking of a scene in Marie
Claire with the nuns going through, but I rejected it.
Both [in] the last one and this one, but I rejected
it.")
7. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) :
" Terence [a
nephew of Professor Murray's] and Napoleon standing on a
hiU above the Marne and watching the artillery down below."
Professor Murray. " This is a war scene—I don't get the
persons clearly, but I think on the hill looking down on
216 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part
the artillery. It is not Saumarez. They may be Oxford
people. I get the bursting of shells. I should think
it was Terence and somebody else—I don't think I know
the other person. I don't think I know him. No I
can't get him."
8. Subject {suggested by Mr. Balfour). Mrs. Arnold Toyn-
BEE (agent) : "Sir Galahad taking his seat on the Siege Peri-
lous, sajring '
If I lose myself I find myself.'
"
Professor Murray. " I am getting this very weakly. This
is Mr. Balfour again. I feel as if it was somebody
uttering an ajDothegm. Somebody saying I wiU do
something or other. No I can't get it."
9. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) :
" I think [of]
Diana of the Crossways. Diana walking up the road in the
ram, and crouching down in front of the empty grate in the
house."
Professor Murray. " This is a book. Oh it's Meredith.
It's Diana walking. I don't remember the scene properly.
Diana walkmg in the ram. I feel as if she was re-
visiting her house, but I can't remember when it hap-
pens " ("A little more ? ") " No—can't oblige."
10. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" I'll think of
Rupert [Brooke] meeting Natacha in War and Peace. Running
in a yellow di'ess ;
rumiing through a wood."
Professor Murray. " V/ell I thought when I came into the
room it was about Rupert. Yes it's fantastic. He's
meetmg somebody out of a book. He's meeting Natacha
in War and Peace. I don't know what he is saying—

the scene ? ") "I should say it was in a wood."
(" Colour of the dress ? ") No. I can't get it."
11. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) : "I think of
Rosalind and Arnold with Wiggs [Mr. and Mrs. Arnold Toynbee
with the dog] driving in a dogcart at the front along the
road that Dad [Professor Murray] went with shells dropping."
Professor Murray. " This is the road where they fired
shrapnel at me. There's a half-bu,rned village, and I

member the name [of the place] " (" Who is with her V)

body else I don't know ! !

" Philip B

look out for the flowers in the morning by the gardener."
(Too much noise.) '

14. Subject. Lady Mary Murray (agent) : "He and I at
the lunch party at the C's up the hiU [at Christiania], and all
the little green sprouts and the tricolors."
Professor Murray. " I think I shall get this. I feel as if
it was you and I going out to a party somewhere
—
going out to lunch, and there are flags and things—
I
ought to get it. Oh it must be at the C's."
(Mr. Murray had got the flags wrong.)
As regards this sitting, Mr. BaKour authorizes me to
state that " he came away from it with a conviction that
hypercesthesia, to whatever length it might be stretched,
could not be made to cover every case. In one instance
(No. 1) Professor Murray, in describing a scene out of a
book which he had not read, added certain striking details
that were present to the mind of the principal agent, but
of which no mention whatever had been made when the
choice of a subject was being decided." See, however,
No. 53, p. 250.
The experiments Mrs. Verrall reported on went down
to the end of 1915. Among those now before us I find
that 23 are dated in 1913 and 1915 respectively, and
were, I presume, accidentally omitted when the notes of
sittings, which are all written on loose sheets of paper, were
sent to Airs. Verrall. Subtracting these from the whole
259 there remain 236 between April 1916 and April 1924,
and these were made on twenty-four separate occa-
218 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [PABT
sions, the number on each varying from 3 to 26,^ with
an average of about 10. It will be seen therefore that the
attempts were infrequent. They were also very irregu-
larly distributed. Sometimes sets would be carried out
at short intervals, and even on two consecutive evenings,
while at other times there were intervals of months, and
twice over of more than a year. The company present,
exclusive of Professor Murray himself, varied in number on
different evenings from 3 to 10, but the most common
number was 6. It was always in the family circle that
the work was done, and though others were generally
present there were never, I think, fewer than two
of Professor Murray's immediate family—his wife or
children—in the party. ^ In the 236 experiments before
us, however, persons outside the immediate family'
have been present and taking active part more fre-
quently, I think, than was the case in the earlier
series examined by Mrs. Verrall. Besides 6 members
of the immediate family, who among them acted as
principal agents 167 times, 30 different people have
acted as principal agents, 19 of them only once. And
the success obtained by these principal agents outside the
immediate family was quite considerable enough by itself,
I think, to convince most people, though it was propor-
tionately less than that of the immediate family. Besides
the 36 persons who have taken the part of principal
agents about 20 others were present at different times.
Indeed only on two occasions, November 22, 1923, and
January 27, 1924, were no outsiders present. I imagine
that none of these outsiders, whether they acted as
^ It is perhaps worth noting that on the two occasions on which 26
experiments were tried at a sitting (September 10, 1916, and July 14,
1918), tliere was an unusual proportion in which Professor Murray
had no impression at all, especially early in the sitting, and this was
probably the reason why so many were tried. For an experiment in
which there is no impression is apt, I imagine, to take less time than
one in which an impression is gradually developed, or is oven immediately
felt and discussed by the company afterwards.

when Mrs. Toynhee went out of the room while Mr. Mellor acted as
principal agent.
'xcii.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 219
principal agents or not, were, strictly speaking, strangers,
and some of them were intimate friends or relations.
Nevertheless, that so many should have shared in the
experiments shows, I think, a widening of the conditions
described by Professor Murray in 1915 (see above, p. 213).
And the same is true of another restriction named by
Professor Murray, namely, change of place, for the 24 sets
of experiments before us were carried out in at least four
different houses. Noise appears to interfere with success
as much as ever ; but this is to be expected, since most
people with psychic gifts seem to find noise a serious and
often a complete obstacle to the exercise of them.^ It
should be added, to make the above statement complete,
that in one only of the 24 sets of experiments (January
2, 1918) was no success whatever obtained. There were
6 experiments—all failures—Mrs. Arnold Toynbee being
agent in 5 and Lady Mary Murray in 1. In 4 of these
cases no impression at all was received—an interruption in
one and noise in another perhaps accounting for two. In
the other 2 of the 6 cases wrong impressions uncon-
vincing to the percipient were experienced, but both
perhaps show signs of some influence from the thought of
the agent. On the other hand there were two occasions
when no failures occurred, the number of experiments
being 4 and 3 respectively. On the first of these occasions
(December 3, 1919) I have reckoned 2 experiments as
successes and 2 as partial successes. An outsider present
took the part of principal agent in one of the partial
successes. The other occasion was on November 22, 1923,
when only members of the family were present and only
3 experiments were tried, of which I reckon two as suc-
cesses and one as a partial success.
It is time I explain this classification and state how
many of the 236 experiments since the end of 1915 I
reckon as successes, etc., but first I must remark that
236 is of course too small a number to base rehable
statistical conclusions upon, and secondly that the classi-
' Seances for phyiieal phenomena at which noise—shiging, talking, etc.
—is insisted on, form an exception to this, if psychic gifts are really
exercised at them.
220 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part
fication is essentially indefinite ; there is no clear line
between one class and another. Endeavouring, however,
to follow the divisions and standards adopted by Mrs.
Verrall in her report I get roughly 85 {i.e. 36 per cent.)
successes, 55 (or 23"3 per cent.) partial successes, and 96
(or 40.7 per cent.) failures. Mrs. Verrall gives her per-
centages as 33' 1, 27-9, 39-0 respectively, so that, if I have
succeeded in dividing the classes as she would have done,
both the successes and the failures in the present set are
proportionally greater than in the previous set, at the
expense of course of the partial successes. But I have
doubts about the standard, and particularly in the failures.
Mrs. Verrall says there is little or no doubt about failures,
and this is true of 47 cases in which no impression was
received,^ and also of some 33 in which the only
impressions were wrong. But there remain about 16
in which the impression was on right lines so far as it
went, but in which it hardly seems to me to have gone
far enough to be reckoned as even a partial success. How
would Mrs. Verrall have reckoned these ? Nos. 2 and
8 on August 26, 1916, quoted above are instances, and
the following is an even clearer one :
—
September 10, 1916.
15. Siibject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" I think of
the girl in [Barrie's] Quality Street bringing down the wedding
dress."
Professor Murray. " No. I think it's a girl in a book,
but can't get it."
Or again on August 17, 1918.
16. Subject. Mr. Geoffrey Curtis (agent) : "I think of
Charles Lamb sitting by the fire with his maniac sister Mary
and dreaming of the wife he would have married."
Professor Murray : "I don't think I get it. I have a
faint impression of a man writing a book or an essay
—
No—I've got a little bit an old fashioned literarj' atmos-
phere."
^ I have included in these 10 cases where the note-taker has merely
Jeft a blank for the percipient's statement, as I feel sure these were
cases of "no impression."
xcii.] Experiments in Thought-TransferMce 221
Or again, to give more complicated examples—complicated
because a wrong idea intrudes itseH and is rejected :
—
February 24, 1918.
17. Subject. Mr. Patok (agent) :
" David O'Rane in 8onia
beginning to teach in his [old] school, and he is blind, and the
boys don't know it."
Professor Murray. "I get a faint impression of a school.
It's not a Baltic baron who can't read."
[It seems likely, as regards the rejected idea, that the name
of Mr. Stephen M'Kemia's novel, Sonia, though of course it is
not a Russian novel nor about Russian people, was responsible
for the idea of Baltic barons, and the blmdness for that of
inability to read.] -
July 14, 1918.
18. Subject. Lady Atjrea Howard (agent) : [Her only
attempt.] " I think of the American who was taken to the
church where the light had never been blown out for hundreds
of years, and he blew it out."
Professor Murray. " Is this a sort of Gothic medieval
thing ? " (" Yes.") " I don't think I know the book or
the story—It's not the people ItiUing Beckett in a church
—it's something like that."
[Here the percipient gets the church, and the occurrence of
something tragic in it.]
If these 16 cases are to be counted not as failures, but
as partial successes, the percentages become 36-0, 30-1,
and 33-9 for successes, partial successes and failures re-
spectively.
A similar difficulty occurs in drawing the line between
successes and partial successes. When the subject chosen
consists of several elements it may easily happen that
the agent fails to grasp one or more of these and yet
gets the essential ones. Mrs. Verrall decided to count as
successes for statistical purposes, "not only all cases where
the complete incident is described, but also cases where
what may be called the essential elements are given by
the percipient," though, as she admits, " opinions will
222 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part
differ as to what is essential." She gives examples to
illustrate her mode of deciding, and I have endeavoured
to judge what are to be taken as successes in the same
way, though of course without complete confidence that
she would have agreed with me. Examples of successes
and partial successes can be seen in the sitting of August
26, 1916, quoted above. Thus No. 1 (p. 214) is clearly
a success. The scene from a Russian book is fully
described by Professor Murray so far as the agent, Mrs.
Toynbee, had spoken of it, and (what is specially inter-
esting), though he had not read the book he gives further
details that were in her mind but had not been men-
tioned by her. He fails, however, to perceive a final
point she was thinking of and would have hked him
to name. No. 4 again—a fantastic subject—is com-
pletely, though only gradually, developed by Professor
Murray. It is interesting to note that the last item,
drawn out by a question by the agent, appeared to the
percipient to be merely a guess. No. 14 in which
Professor Murray recalls the real incident thought of by
the agent was also apparently a complete success.
On the other hand, Nos. 9 and 10 though, I
think, undeniably successes by Mrs. Verrall's standard,
each fail in one particular. In 9 Professor Murray did
not get Diana crouching by the empty grate, and in 10
he did not get the colour of Natacha's dress. For partial
successes we have a clear case, I think, in No. 6.
The percipient recognises that the subject concerns Tess
in Hardy's Tess of the Durhervilles, but fails to get the
scene. Nos. 7 and 11 are perhaps more difficult to
decide about, as they are so nearly complete successes.
But I have called them only partial successes because in
each case the percipient fails to recognise a person
important in the supposed incident. Failure, by the
percipient, to get some name or other item—impor-
tant or unimportant—forming part of the subject as
described by the agent happens rather often. An attempt
is sometimes made, either spontaneously by the percipient
or in reply to a question by the agent, to supply these
missing items. The attempt sometimes succeeds, as in

No. 4 above (p. 215), and No. 23 below (p. 224), and see,
e.g. Appendix Nos. 49, 68, 82, 88, 110, 134, but sometimes
leads to a wrong guess, see, e.g. Appendix Nos. 109, 111,
115, 120, 122.
It will have been realised both from Mrs. VerralFs
report and from the cases already reported in the present
paper that the subjects selected by the agents are very
various. We may divide them roughly into five classes :
—
(A) Scenes or incidents, either real or imaginary but
possible, in which the experimenters themselves or their
friends and acquaintances are concerned. Nos. 11,
13 and 14 above are instances, and see also Appendix,
e.g. Nos. 46, 96, 108, 127, etc. ;
(B) Scenes or incidents
from books, plays, or history (real or imaginary, but not
fantastic) or newspapers. Nos. 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 15, 16,
17, 18 above are instances, and see also Appendix, e.g.
Nos. 58, 73, 92, 137, etc. ;
(C) Fantastic scenes or
incidents, including dreams. Nos. 2, 4, 7, 10 above
are instances, and see also Appendix, e.g. Nos. 109,
110, 120, 128, etc. ;
(D) Particular quotations asked for.
No. 12 above is an unsuccessful instance. The following
are successful ones :
—
December 27 (1919 ?),
19. Subject. Miss Agnes Mtjrkay (agent) :
" I thmk of the
begimiing of Shelley's Ode to the West Wind."
Professor Murray. " I think this is a poem—O Wild
West Wind."
[These are the first words of the poem.]
December 3, 1919.
20. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) :
" I'll think of
The Shropshire Lad :
—
When smoke stood up from Ludlow,
And mist blew off from Teme,
And blythe afield to ploughing
Against the morning beam,
I strode beside my team."
Professor Murray. "This is a poem—oh it's the thing in
224 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part
The Shropshire Lad, where De dum de dum from Ludlow
and dum de dum from Teme—smoke—mist."
See for other instances No. 30 below (p. 234) and
Appendix Nos. 65, 81, and perhaps 80. In the fifth
class (E) are inanimate scenes, or rather scenes in which
human beings do not appear, e.g. No. 21, "The sun
sparkling on the water yesterday on the lake," on J^lly 14,
1918, and No. 22, "The four destroyers we saw this evening,"
on September 10, 1916. There are only five in this class
altogether, and only one was successful, and it is perhaps
doubtful whether that one should be placed in the class
as it certainly strongly suggests human activity. It is as
follows :
—
December 30, 1919.
23. Subject. Mr. Basil Murray (agent) :
" I think of Sham-
rock IV. coming into Southampton water in a storm, after
winning Atlantic Cup."
Professor Murray. " I should say it was a yacht running
before a strong wind—running into harbour—a thing I
have never had before—yacht running into harbour in a
storm. I should say a West country place like South-
ampton or Plymouth " (" Any particular yacht ? ")
"One of the Shamrocks."

is no doubt that the fantastic and the unusual specially
lends itself to the successful guessing of Professor Murray."
Xcii.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 225
Probably such subjects tend to be more amusing to the
agent, and thus perhaps to be more vividly in his mind,
or to be there with what one may call a more explosive
quality. Or perhaps their oddness more easily arrests the
attention of the percipient.
Inversely, it may be owing to then' not being vividly
interesting to the principal agent that subjects suggested
by some other person present seem apt to fail. There
are only three in the present series, two of which are
quoted above (Nos. 2 and 8), and all of which failed ;
^
but there were 40 instances, of which the undue proportion
of 20 failed, among the experiments reported on by Mrs.
Verrall (see Proc, vol. xxix., p. 72).
This brings us to the question of the function of
the principal agent. As already said, all the persons
present know the subject selected, and all try, or
are supposed to try, to transfer it telepathically to
the percipient as soon as he enters the room. We
may therefore ask (a) whether the principal agent takes
any larger share than the others in the transfer-
ence, and (6) if so, why ? As regards (a), it is clear,
I think, that the principal agent has a predominant
share in transferring the impression, because with the
same group of agents in the room the success with certain
principal agents is on the whole greater than with others.
Mrs. Arnold Toynbee, e.g., is more effective as principal
agent than when she is merely one of the company. As
regards {b), the principal agent diifers as a rule from the
rest of the company in two respects. He or she selects
the subject, and therefore is likely to grasp it more clearly
and vividly than the others present do. And, what is
perhaps more important, the percipient attends especially
to the principal agent, which probably tends to bring
their minds into special rapport.
In the earlier experiments it was the practice to try to
intensify this rapport by the percipient holding the hand
1 In two other experiments (September 14, 1916, and July 14, 1918
respectively) Professor Murray imagined wrongly that the subject had
been suggested to the principal agent by someone else. One of these
was a failure and the other a success. (See Appendix No. 93.)
226 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part
of the principal agent. I am not sure whether this is
still the usual plan. The drawback to it is, of course,
that in certain cases of gradual development of an impres-
sion, indications might be given by variation in hand
pressure. Approval or disapproval might also be indicated
by facial expression and movements of the agents gener-
ally, but more delicate shades might be given by the hand
of the principal agent. There are some cases where, as
an impression develops gradually item by item, the with-
drawal by the percipient of some item already mentioned
which sometimes occurs (see, e.g. Appendix Nos. 90, 102a,
105, 112, 129) may be influenced by subconscious perception
of the agent's disapproval ; bvit I think there are very few,
if any, of the experiments in which guidance of the kind
required to draw out correct items could have been ob-
tained in this way. However this may be, there have
been enough successful experiments in which the hand was
not held to show that holding it was not a necessary
condition.
1
It seems possible that agents sometimes interfere with
each other. This may have happened in the sittings on
September 10 and 14, 1916, the only occasions on which
Mr. W. Mellor was present. Numerous experiments—twenty-
1 We have in the present series 7 experiments in which it is ex-
pHcitly stated that there was no contact, and 2 in which Professor
Murray described his impression as he entered the room, and therefore
cannot have been holding the agent's hand. Among these 9 there
were 1 failure, 2 partial successes, Appendix No. 55 being one of
them, and 6 successes, for which see Appendix Nos. 52, 54, 71, 72,
80 and No. 40 below (p. 243). After starting an experiment with
no contact the hand was taken in tlie middle four times. In one of
these (see Appendix No. 53), with good results, and in two cases, of
which one, No. 66, is given in the Appendix, with apparently no result.
In one (.Appendix No. 56), contact is followed by a correct but entirely
irrelevant and promptly rejected impression about a book the agent had
been reading. I am disposed to think that on some other occasions,
even when nothing is said abovit it, there was no contact, because
contact is mentioned in one experiment of a set, as e.g. on September
14, 1916, Appendix No. 66. It is perhaps worth mentioning that on
December 27 (1919 ?), when Professor M'Dougall was acting unsuccess-
fully as principal agent, Miss Agnes Murray took the hand in the
middle of the experiment to see if this would improve matters, but it
did not.

six and nineteen respectively—were tried on these two
occasions, and Mr. Mellor was principal agent in eighteen of
them, with a degree of success ranking with that of the
immediate family. But they were pecuhar sittings, and
included a quite unusual proportion of failures. Mrs. Arnold
Toynbee started as principal agent on September 10, and
began with four failures. Lady Mary Murray followed with
a failure, and then Mx. Mellor tried, two partial successes
and a failure resulting. Then Miss Heath tried once and
failed, and so did Mrs. Arnold Toynbee. She had nothing
but failures on this day, though usually a very successful
agent. Mr. Mellor followed with two partial successes, Mrs.
Toynbee with a failure, ]VIr. Mellor again with a very partial
success and three failures, and then Mr. Basil Murray,
Miss Heath, and Lady Mary Murray with one failure each.
There had thus been twenty experiments with nothing that
I have counted as a success. But at this point success
began. Mr. Arnold Toynbee taking the part of principal
agent obtained a complete success (No. 33, p. 236 below),
and an interesting partial success (Appendix No. 61), and
Mr. Mellor followed with two successes (Appendix Nos.
62 and 63), and Mr. Basil Murray with one, Appendix
No. 64. The sitting ended with a failure. A contem-
porary note at the end of the sitting says :
—
" A curious evening. Mr. Murray had a feeling the whole
time that everyone was doing it very badly. Mr. Murray
jumped at everythmg with Mr. Mellor, but nothing would last
long. Everything was very short. After a little time with Mr.
Mellor it went off, and after trying with others—Rosalind [Mrs.
Toynbee], Lady Mary, Miss Heath and Basil, Mr. Mellor was
better agam. Again Mr. Mellor fell off, and Arnold [Mr.
Toynbee] was a success, and then returning to Mr. Mellor, he
was better than before. Mr. Murray, the whole time, had to
do it in Mr. Mellor's way, which rather aggravated [Note breaks
off here]."
At the next sitting on September 14, Mr. Mellor being
again present, there was more success, though still much
failure. The experimenters must, I think, have had the
idea that there was perhaps in some unknown way inter-
22? Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part
ference between agents, for the plan was adopted of Mr.
Mellor leaving the room during four of the experiments
while Mrs. Toynbee was acting as principal agent, and
Mrs. Toynbee leaving it during four experiments while
Mr. Mellor was principal agent ; and it certainly happened
that of the six successes obtained that evening, five—two
with Mrs. Toynbee and three with Mr. Mellor—occurred
while the other was out of the room. The matter is not
commented on ui the contemporary notes.
^
With so large a demand for suitable subjects to transfer
as these experiments involved, one would expect occasion-
ally to meet with repetition. And there is a httle. In
the present series there are two iiistances in which the
same subject from a book is selected by the same agent
after an interval of a few months, and is successful both
times. (See Appendix Nos. 52 and 53.) And there
are further two subjects from books—^the Bird-droves
chorus from Hippolytus and Shelley rescued from drowning
—which appear once m this series and also once in that
reported on by Mjrs. Verrall (see Appendix Nos. 45 and
99) ; but while the hrst of these produced a wrong im-
pression on the earlier occasion and was successful on the
Apropos of above paragraph Professor Murray writes to me :
—" In the
two cases of X and Y, who are both rather psychic, the experiments went
badly wrong until we made them themselves the agents. I.e. I could not
get messages from Rosalind while X or Y was there, but when she
went away and one of them was agent, or if they went away and left
her as agent, all went well. This happened only with these two persons,
and once or twice with my daughter Agnes. She rather disturbed the
commimications until she became agent. But later on, when she had
her full fling as agent, she did not disturb Rosalind's communications
any more. (I never saw enough of X or Y to be able, so to
speak, to satiate their desire to act as agent.) I am inclmed therefore
to think that the disturbing element is a sort of restless desire on the
part of some one present to act as agent. If so, it is not significant,
since any irritation or anger ixi the room acts like a loud noise and
incapacitates me at once. I do not think I ever foimd scepticism any
particidar obstacle. Putting this more briefly :
—I mean, it is generally
supposed in our circle that the presence of another '
medium '
is dis-
turbing ; I suggest that perhaps it is not the ' mediumistic '
quality, but
a certain irritated feeling, '
I could do that : I want to do that rnyself,'
which causes the disturbance."
xcii.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 229
second, the other, very successful eariier, produced no
impression at all when given again. On none of the
occasions do either agent or percipient appear to have
been conscious of the repetition.
So far the experiments have been discussed either from
the pomt of view of success and failure, or from that of
the agent's share in them. I now turn to the interesting
and important question of what light is thrown by the
records on the way the ideas the agent desires to transfer
reach the mind of the percipient. In connection with this,
Professor Murray's own discussion of the subject in 1915
{Proct^edings, vol. xxix., pp. 57-63) should be read. He
tells us in his Presidential address, among other things,
that he thuiks that when experimenting he probably gets
into a state of slight hypersesthesia and is particularly
sensitive to every kind of impression—noises, for instance,
becoming mtolerable. He also says he inchnes to the
conclusion that
" the basis of this so-called telepathy is unconscious sense-
perception, the sensory disturbance itself being too slight for
consciousness, but the state of mind resiiltrag from it being
fuUy perceptible But," he adds, "we must be prepared
for the possibility that this sense-perception is not confined to
the canonical five chamaels of Sight, Sound, Smell, Taste,
Touch . . . Again, some of the information which seems to
come most clearly and rapidly, as when I feel a certam emo-
tional atmosphere, or the country to which an uicident belongs,
or the fact that it is in a book and not in real life, does not
seem to be the sort that could well be conveyed by mere
sense-impressions of the canonical sort. Thus 1 should be
inclined provisionally to admit the likelihood that we may
become directly sensitive to another person's state of mind."
In this last sentence Professor Murray of course admits
the probability that telepathy has operated, but without
committing himself to telepathy bemg a purely psychical
process. He leaves the way open, as I understand him,
to the theory which used to be described as "brain
waves," but of which little has been heard of late. His
230 Mrs. Hennj Sidgivick [part,,
suggestion of hyperaesthesia, however, makes it necessary |
to scrutinise the records carefully to see what sign of it ;
there is. I will begin with the less important senses.
Touch, which can, I think, only have operated through
holding of hands, and then only in expressing approval or
disapproval by the agent of what has already been said
by the percipient, has been discussed above (p. 226). Taste
and smell do not so far as I can see come into the ques-
tion of hyperaesthesia at all, because there were no real
tastes and smells to be intensified by it. It is true that i
the percipient's impression began with a sensation of smell
on two occasions, but this had nothing to do with any
'
physically caused sensation. I shall revert to the matter later.
The possibility of hyperaesthesia of sight—unless on the
extreme assumption that we can potentially see anything
anywhere at any distance and through any obstacle, and
that therefore the percipient can read the note-taker's record I
of the " subject "—is in much the same position as that of t
touch. The only scope for it seems to be in the seeing of I
slight signs of approval or disapproval as the percipient
proceeds with his description. He cannot, however much his
sensibility is heightened, be supposed to see concrete ideas
or names in the faces of the agents. Sight in the sense
of mental seeing—the share of mental pictures in the
percipient's impressions—like imaginary smells and sounds
we must return to later.
The only sense through which we can seriously imagine
hyperaesthesia helping Professor Murray in his
'"'
guesses
"
is, I think, it will be agreed, the sense of hearing. In the
experiments before us the subject selected for transmission
is always spoken before it is written down, and I learn
from Professor Murray that at the beginning of the ex-
periments tests were made to see if any fragments of
ordinary conversation could be heard at the place where
he usually stood, and that the experimenters were satisfied
that they could not. His own ordinary hearing, he tells
me, is normal, but certainly not unusually acute. It
may, however, be that though out of earshot so far as
consciousness or normal hearing is concerned, he yet sub-
consciously hears the agent's description. There are some
xcu.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 231
arguments, both for and against this possibiUty, to be
found
^
in the experiments under consideration, as there
were in those reported on by Mrs. Verrall.
Takuig first thuigs which suggest hearing. There were first
and foremost two experiments stopped because Professor
Murray heard, or thought he had heard, a name. In the
first (No. 24) (August 17, 1918) the subject was "Pendennis
at Charterhouse," and Professor Murray heard the word
'Pendennis.' In the second (No. 25) (December 20, 1919)
the subject was "Denis motoring from here to London
by, etc," and Professor Murray heard '
Denis.' In both
cases the agent was Mr. Basil Murray. Professor Murray
writes to me as regards these occasions, " I am not
clear whether accidentally from excitement somebody had
spoken unusually loud, or whether my hearing was super-
normal. It seemed to me hke the first, but this is not
evidence."
In a very curious case, in which a name was neither
consciously heard or apprehended, it vet seems as if it
must have '
got through,' and if so, was the only part of
the " subject " that did. It was as follows :
July 14, 1918.
26. Subject. Mr. Penmoklan Main (agent) :
" Sh Francis
Drake drinking the health of Doughty before he was led out
to be hanged."
Pbofessor Murray. " Is this a-?-No, I've a faint feeling
of Arabia or desert."
Now Mr. C. M. Doughty, the traveller, wrote a well-
known book called Travels in Arabia Deserta, and it seems
almost certain that the " faint feeling of Arabia or desert
"
arose from association of ideas with the name Douc^htv
—the association with Thomas Doughty, the mutineeV
tried and executed by Drake, being at the moment absent
It this IS correct, how did the item Doughty reach the
percipient with the exclusion of other items in the "sub-
ject " proposed ? 1 It is obviously just what might have
ca^e of orJy a single word of the "subject" being apprehended
given m Mrs. Verrall's record, p. 74. Also one where the sound of a
word was grasped and at first misinterpreted.
232 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part
happened in case of imperfect hearing. But this kind of
imperfect apprehension, followed by wrong associations of
ideas, might also happen telepathically.^ In the following
case, though the chain of association is more doubtful
than in the Doughty case, I think the one I shall suggest
is probably the real one ; and if so, sound is not a link
in it.
September 10, 1916.
27. Subject. Mr. Mellor (agent) :
" I'm thinking of the
operating room in the nursing home in which I was operated."
Professor Murray. " I got an impression of a theatre.
No. I can't get it. I'm now guessing—Covent Garden
and CEdipus."
I think that here the idea of an operating room reached
the percipient's consciousness in the form of theatre
—
operating theatre of a hospital—but was not under-
stood, being in fact taken to be a place where plays are
acted. But the mistake, in whatever way it arose, was
not auditory.
It should perhaps be considered on the side of auditory
hyperaesthesia that on the two occasions when the " subject
"
had been suggested to the principal agent by Mr. Gerald
Balfour (see Nos. 2 and 8 above), the fact that it was
Mr. Balfour's suggestion was realised by the percipient,
as might have been the case if he had heard his voice.
But again this might equally be due to telepathy.
The apprehension of the rhythm of a verse or a sen-
tence before that of its meaning may be suggestive of an
auditory channel of transmission, and there are one or two
instances of this. No. 20 above (p. 223), where a stanza
from The Shropshire Lad is recognised but not completely
quoted by the percipient, is perhaps a case. And the
following is one where the impression of rhythm and of
the sound of counting combine to suggest possible hearing.
1 We must not altogether ignore the possibility that some one of the
agents may have had in mind, perhaps subconscioiisly, the association
of the name Doughty with Arabia Deserta and conveyed this telepathic-
ally to the percipient, and a similar possibility must be kept in mind in
some other cases.

The search for instances of possible sensory transmission
pleads to dwelling on experiments that failed, and it will
be refreshing to turn to one that succeeded, but in which
the rhythm of part of the central sentence was appre-
hended before the words and sense were gradually grasped.

29. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" This is the
gu-1 in the Cherry Orchard, by TchekofE, saying—When I was

Professor Murray. " I think this is a Russian story—
a

When I was the something, I
went up in a balloon ' —' when I was in Paris, I went

I have not noticed any instances such as occurred in
iihe series reported on by IVIrs. Verrall, where a name or
I word was mistaken for one similar in sound, and I think
[ have given above all the instances which in any way
lupport the idea of auditory hypersesthesia, unless the
ilmost verbatim repetition by the percipient of the " sub-
ect " set, whether prose or poetry, which sometimes
>ccurs be regarded as such. In the case of poetry, how-
ver, a fuU and correct transmission of the idea would of
ourse produce the quotation asked for verbatim, if the
toem is known to the percipient. The following is an
astance :

'
[The original runs :

|

The only instance I recall of the almost word for word
reproduction of the whole of a prose " subject," is the
following :
I
May 26, 1923.
31. Subject. Me. Denis Mubeay (agent) :
" Wiggs throwing
the Idtten in the air at Overstrand."
Peofessob Muebay. " This time I've got a clear idea.
Wiggs tossing the kitten in the air at Overstrand."
Here the words used are so much the natural ones ir
which to describe the short and simple incident, that
whether the idea reached the percipient telepathically oi
otherwise he would be hkely to clothe it in that form
Still, of course, auditory hypersesthesia is not excluded.
I now proceed to cases which do seem to exclude
auditory hypersesthesia, and cases where, if it operated al
all, its effect on the percipient's reproduction of the
" subject " must have been indirect. The most crucia
kind of case is that in which the percipient has corred
impressions of things neither mentioned by the agent ii
giving the "subject" nor such as would necessarily bej^j,
inferred from what is mentioned. There are a few in
stances of this. No. 1 (p. 214 above) is a case ii
point ; for the impression that in a scene from a bool
the people present were mocking and then were sorry anc
wanted to be kind, was true, but had not been mentioned
and Professor Murray had not read the book. Anothe

example from a book which he appears not to have read
will be found in the Appendix No. 88. That the person
to whom shelter was given was a spy and an Englishman
is not either stated or implied in the words of the agent,
but was nevertheless arrived at by the percipient. Another
case where a " subject " is taken from a book is somewhat
different from these. It is given in full in the Appendix
No. 48. The subject consisted of "the gkl skating,"
from a Swedish book named by the agent. The percipient
got Scandinavia and, after first being misled by another
association with Scandinavia and skating, which he re-
jected, correctly got a girl skating in "a very wild atmo-
sphere" "and wild burly people," and named the book in
which the scene occurred and which he had read. But
the book he named was different from that named by
the agent ;
and it turned out that he was right—^the
scene intended was in the book named by him. It is
clear that his impression went far beyond anything said
by the agent or necessarily implied in what was said. He
must first, it would appear, have got the scene and the
general atmosphere, and then remembered where it came
j^ifrom. In a fourth case the incident described was not
jt;from a book. The agent imagined a high two-wheeled
buggy being driven down Holywell at Oxford, and the
,^ J
percipient got this, but added that it was on "a muddy
jwet day." The agent had not mentioned mud, but after-
wards said that she had thought of it (see Appendix No.
itl8jll5). It is curious that though the percipient appears
3t|t.hus to have apprehended a sort of accidental accessory
Ho the picture in the agent's mind, he failed to realise
iwho the person was who was supposed to be driving the
ect|buggy—a person well known to him.
The kind of case which may be put next in order as
svidence against auditory hyperajsthesia is that in which
the percipient fails to recognise a person or book named
ijby the agent but realises something which is true about
Hhat person or book though not mentioned by the agent—
somethmg which would, however, have been a natural
inference from the name had the name been grasped. A
li^^.ase in point is the following :

March 10, 1913.
32. Subject. Mks. Arnold Toynbeb (agent) :
" I'll think of
Margaret K at a particular restaurant in Munich where I
used to have lunch."
Professor Murray. " It's some girl I don't know—a Cam-
bridge girl, I think—I can't get it clear—is she standing
in a restaurant or something like that 1
"
Here, if the agent had grasped the name, Margaret K ,
he would have known, no doubt, that she was a Cam-
bridge girl he did not know ; but it is difficult to see how
he can have arrived at these unmentioned facts about her
(except telepathically) without the name. |*
Two cases in the Appendix (Nos. 92 and 94) may fa
be referred to in this connection. In No. 92 the per-f"ai
cipient does not realise that it is the death of Hereward
the Wake that the agent had spoken of, though he does
realise that the somebody killed was early Saxon or Norse
and fought with a battle-axe—which facts had not been
named. In No. 94 the " subject " is taken from a book
the percipient had not read, but he realises that it is a
sort of legend or fairy story, though this is not implied
in the agent's words, at least apart from the unappre-
hended name.
The order in which the elements of a " subject " present
themselves in the impression of the percipient is often
very unlike what one would expect if the impression
depended on hearing the words spoken by the agent.
One form of this is when the agent names a person, and
a mental picture presents itseH to the percipient, inter-
preted by him as representing that person whom he then,
but only then, names. For example, on September 10,
1916 :
33. Subject. Mr. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" I'll do Riff
Van Winkle coming down the mountain." i^'
Professor Murray. " Oh I've got this. It's an old sort d
gnome-like person with a matted beard coming down—
r
very funny feeling expecting to be known and fine
things—Oh it's Rip Van Winkle."
Professor Murray gets a good picture of Rip Van Winkle [j^
lo,
liim

ink
pec
xcn.] Experiments m Thought-Transference 237
with appropriate description of his mental state—neither
"'
derived directly from the agent's words—before he realises
that his picture represents Rip Van Winkle after awaking
ifrom his 200 years' sleep.
Other somewhat similar instances in the Appendix are
No. 70, where the saUent personality in the agent's
i
statement, is named only after being described by
- the percipient; No. 82, where Mr. Gladstone is spoken
II- of by the percipient as a dignified person before he is
iwjrecognised ; Nos. 86 and 98, where the name Lusitania
—
eri prominent in the " subject "—is got at by the percipient
after "Torpedoed ship—people getting away in boats...
ly great big ship " has been said in the first case, and
r-
" awful impression of naval disaster " in the second. A
rdname uttered by the agent, but only appearing after
feeling about the subject by the percipient occurs also in
some cases of confused impressions gradually developing
into the right one. A conspicuous example is Appendix
No. 90, when Rousseau and the right incident concerning
tiim are at length grasped. Compare also Appendix
ed'No. 102a.
e-j There are two instances where the idea required is
jintroduced by a feeUng of an appropriate smell. The
nt 'ollowing is one of them :
pn ...
April 22, 1923.
34. Subject. Mr. Patrick Murray (agent) [The only time
ie acted as such] :
" The lion in the Zoo tr\ang to reach a large
liece of meat just outside the cage."
Professor Mtjrray. "A sort of smell of wild animals—car-
nivorous animals. Something grabbing through bars at a
piece of meat at a Zoo. Don't know the animal."
.n the other instance which is quoted in full in the
Appendix No. 49, Professor Murray begins by saying
'This is curious. I've got a smell of some kind of in-
^lensy stufi—I should think it was opium or hashish—
"
^he "subject" being in fact a night club and opium den.
The smell experienced by the percipient in both these cases
Qust have been an imaginary or hallucinatory smell ; there
'°'an hardly have been any real smell to suggest it. And
238 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [paut
why the required impression should enter the consciousness
of the percipient in this particular way is mysterious. It is
possible, no doubt, that the agents, or one of them, may
have been thinking of the smell appropriate to the idea
they wished to transfer ; but had they been conscious of
doing so, the fact would almost certainly have been
mentioned after the experiment. I think it must be \
assumed that the idea of the smell originated in the i
percipient's mind, and if so, that hypersesthesia cannot
have had anjrthing directly to do with it.
It will be observed that there is a difference in the
relation of the smell to the whole impression in these
cases and in the experience of smell in the case mentioned
by Professor Murray in his Presidential address. (Proc, vol.
xxix., p. 59). In this earlier case a small bit of tarry
coal falling out of the fire was the apparent means of
bringing into consciousness the smell of oil or paint burn-
ing, and so the scene of Savonarola and the burning of
pictures, etc., in the square at Florence ; there was an
external cause—perhaps a real smell from the tarry coal
—
to suggest the smell of burning pictures. In the cases
before us there seems to have been nothing to suggest
the smell except the " subject " of the experiment itself.
On one occasion, what was presumably in part at least
a sensation of soimd, " the feeling of something whizzing
along at a tremendous speed—aeroplane or car "—introduced
the percipient's correct impression (a certain motor car
race, see Appendix No. 130), just as an appropriate
sensation of smell introduced it in the two cases just
mentioned. There was no real sound to suggest it, apparently.
We may note in passing that, like smells, inarticulate
sounds seem to have entered very little into any part of
Professor Murray's impressions. I find but three cases
besides the one just referred to which suggest it. One
is the successful impression in No. 7 (p. 215 above),
where getting " the bursting of shells " may have meant
that they were heard, though not necessarily so. In the
other two the impressions were entirely wrong, but may
have included sound. In No. 35, September 10, 1916,
the percipient got a " sort of feeUng of a heavy hammer
10
lc(
xcn.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 239
in an engineering place " when the subject was " the waves
breaking on the breakwater." And in No. 36 on April
29, 1917, he had a " faint impression of an explosion or a
fire " when the subject was " Mr. Asquith being taken up
to the front in a staff car down at Verdun." Only once,
so far as I know, did an agent try to impress an in-
articulate sound on the percipient—it was the croaking of
frogs—but no impression was received (see Appendix No.
60). It occurred, however, in the middle of a series of
failures.
Returning to the question of hyperaesthesia. Cases where
the percipient's impressions begin with something associated
. in idea with the " subject " of the experiment, but some-
thing not alluded to by the agent at all, must I think be
regarded as weighing against any explanation by auditory
hyperaesthesia, for the associated idea precedes any know-
ledge of the subject. The foUowmg is a case in point :
August 17, 1918.
37. Subject. Mr. Basil Murray (agent) :
" I'm thinking of the
I
Etruscan seer who during the siege of Veil was captured by a
young Roman warrior. He told them to drain the Alban lake
in order to take Veii."
Professor Murray. " I don't thmk it's Balaam, but it's
something like—It's a prophet who's serving the wrong
side—not Hebrew. I think it's early Roman—I've got
the impression that he's telling them to drain a marsh.
—
Does he come in Livy ? I get an impression that he's
caught and made to reveal a secret."
For other examples see Appendix Nos. 77 and 81 and
No. 42 (p. 244 below). And perhaps we may class with
these the following case (only partially successful) where
an emotion—that of being frightened, unmentioned by the
agent—appears to precede any realisation by the percipient
of facts which would have justified it.
May 29, 1919.
38. Subject. Miss Agkes Murray (agent) :
" Don Juan eat-
ing cucumber sandwiches with [X. Y. a modern woman] on
'
Mount Vesuvius."
240 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part
Professok Mueray. " Curious feeling of being frightened.
It's quite clearly Mount Vesuvius. It isn't an eruption.
It is some one quite idly on the top, not frightened—
picknickmg—simply my own feeling how dangerous it is
"
(" Can you get who they are ? ") " No—Rosalind. They
are eating their picnic."
(Mr. Murray had a feelmg of cucumber at one time.)
A case which may be compared with this is No. 78
in the Appendix, where the emotion of being afraid in a
first battle presents itself not inappropriately, though the
impression as a whole is a failure.
With these cases of emotion may be considered what
Professor Murray calls in his Presidential address, " a
sort of indeterminate sense of quality or atmosphere " ^
—
geographical, literary or other—which often precedes any
more definite idea in his impression, and which appears
to him unlikely to be conveyed by the senses. There is,
however, apt to be some word or phrase in the " subject
"
given which, if apprehended, might suggest the atmo-
sphere in question, as there is, e.g. in the case No, 78
just referred to.
Another argument against the source of Professor
Murray's impressions being actual hearing is afforded by
cases where the general idea is manifestly caught by the
percipient and the right atmosphere, as it were, given,
yet no single important word of the subject is reproduced
by the percipient. No. 97 in the Appendix is a case in
point. We get there King George " giving V.C.'s and
things "—or at any rate " an investiture of some sort," for
Queen Victoria giving medals to the Crimean soldiers,
There is a similar kind of transformation in No. 84.
where crowded Eastern streets are substituted for the
bazaar in Cairo ; but in this case the guess that follows
is badly off the track. >
I think there is not much more to be said for or
against aid being received by Professor Murray through
the senses, or in particular the sense of hearing. In

address quoted above, pp. 212, 213.

some cases the evidence against it seems, as we have seen,
conclusive, and I feel sure that if hearing, however hyper-
aesthetic, has operated at all, it has done so rarely.
I do not propose to comment on all the experiments
before us, one by one. But before concluding, there are
a few things about the way the impression comes to the
percipient which it may be interesting to note. Though
Professor Murray's attempts to reproduce the agent's
subject are sometimes spoken of as guesses, no one, after
reahsing the degree of success obtained, will imagine that
mere guessing could have produced it. It is evident that
telepathy, or some other agency, has been at work. At
the same time Professor Murray distinguishes three things
—namely, the impressions that come to him from without,
inferences from these impressions, and guesses to supple-
ment them. No doubt both inferences and guesses may
sometimes really be impressions from without, but they
do not appear so at the time to the percipient. In the
following case impression, guess, and inference are all
exemplified.
December 26, 1921.
39. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) :
" I think of John
Bright going to speak in Birmingham on free trade—so fright-
ened he feU off his chair."
Professor Murray. "This is somebody all of a tremble-
It's somebody with [a] sort of stage fright who is going
to make a big speech—I think he faUs down—Does he
faU off his chair ? Oh I'm merely guessing—but I should
think it's John Bright—oh well—the rest I can guess.
I suppose he was making [the] speech on free trade-at
Birmingham."
I
The percipient here gets an impression of the scene,
jj
guesses that John Bright was the person concerned, and
I
given these facts, infers that he was making a speech on
1 free trade ;
for I assume that when Professor Murray said
'
"the rest I can guess," he meant it appeared to him a
I
pretty obvious inference.
It is of course the "impressions," as probable examples
242 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part
of telepathy, that interest us ; and their nature and
quaUty vary in different ways. First they differ in in-
tensity and clearness—varying from strong to faint or
even very faint, and from clear to blurred. From the
remarks occasionally made by the percipient about the
vividness, etc., of particular impressions, I should judge
that one which is strong and clear, or which comes
quickly, is usually right, but not always.^ But, on the
other hand, the impressions may be faint and dim or
blurred, or slow in developing, in quite successful ex-
periments.
Slow development is, sometimes at least, a kind of
groping after the " subject " with or without ultimate
success. The feeling, I suppose, is like what we have
when we are trying to recall something
—
e.g. a name or
an address—which we know we ought to remember and
feel on the verge of remembering, but which will not
emerge into consciousness. Perhaps indeed the attempt in
both cases is to raise into consciousness what is already
in our minds subconsciously. A very good instance of
groping for the right impression which does not come is
No. 47 in the Appendix. See also No. 16, (p. 220
above), and Appendix No. 139. Successful groping is
seen in No. 4, (p. 215 above), and in other cases of
gradual development (e.g. Appendix Nos. 61, 90, 95).
An instance where groping probably led to guessing is
1 In 17 of the 33 cases of failure (spoken of on p. 220 above) in
which Professor Murray got some impression, but a wholly wrong one,
it is stated that the impression was faint or vagxie, and in all these
but one this statement about faintness was made before anything was
said of what the impression was. In the other 16 cases nothing at all
was said about the intensity of the impression. There is, however, a
case of mixed success and failure on February 24, 1918, when the
subject to be transferred was an incident concerning a Mrs. B. '
being
silly '
at a cricket match. Professor Murray described another incident
concerning her and then said, " No—it is Mrs. B.—I don't expect I
shall get it—because I got that ]'the wrong incident] quite clearly."
On reading this report Professor Murray added : —" But the incident,
though wrong, was a very characteristic example of the kind of
'
silliness '
implied. The mistake was perhaps due to my subconscious
self over-dramatising the vague expression." The principal agent in
this case was acting as such for the only time in the present series.
xcn.] Experhnents hi Thought-Transference 243
Appendix No. 118, where the subject is "the four riders
of the Apocalypse," and the percipient having got gallop-
ing horses, and presumably some subconscious idea that
there is something unreal about them, thinks for a moment
that it is going to be a Walkyrie ride.
In contrast to cases of gradual development are those
where the impression comes instantly, and the percipient
probably could not have told us how it came to him.
For instances of this see Appendix Nos. 46 and 80, and
the following case (which chronologically followed 80).
November 18, 1917.
40. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) :
" Alice in Wonder-
land, falling down the rabbit hole and landing where Bill the
Lizard is watching, and White Rabbit is going by at the
same time."
Professor Murray (as he enters the room). " I want to say
'
Oh my ears and whiskers.'
"
[In the book, when Alice after falling down the rabbit hole
pursues and comes up with the White Rabbit, he is saying
'
0 my ears and whiskers, how late it's growing.' Bill the
Lizard does not appear in this scene in the book.]
In this case the impression takes the form of a quotation
so appropriate as to make it certain that the subject to
be transferred has been apprehended. There are several
examples of this. The following is one :
Augiist 17, 1918.
41. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) :
" I think of the
scene in Macbeth when the feast is beginning and Lady Macbeth
is sittmg at the head of the table, and Macbeth comes in and
won't sit down because he sees the murdered ghost."
Professor Murray. " I've got this :
—' Which of you has
done this ?
'
It's Macbeth when he sees the ghost in
the chair."
[The quotation is Macbetli's first remark when he sees Ban-
quo's ghost in his chair.]
Compare with this Appendix Nos. 76, 85, 89, 106,
107. In No. 109 an appropriate quotation comes to
244 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part
Professor Murray at once, but does not imply the whole
subject, most of which, however, is successfully developed
afterwards.
In all these cases where the answer is given in the
form of a quotation, it would seem probable that the
agent's ideas reached the percipient first as ideas.
In other cases, as we have seen, the impression comes
first through a sensory mental channel, e.g. smell in No.
34, (p. 237), sound in Appendix No. 130, a visual image
in No. 33, (p. 236). A very clear case of a visual image
and nothing else wiU be found in the Appendix No. 101.
The percipient recognised almost all the details of the
scene intended as though he had had the scene itself or
an actual picture of it before his eyes, but—as would
equally have been the case with a real picture unex-
plained—he failed to realise the agent's chief idea, which
was that the little girl sewing under the apple trees was
a youthful Joan of Arc. Her appearance could not inter-
pret itself as Rip Van Winkle's could.
Probably in most cases the impression comes in a mixed
way—partly as ideas not, at least to begin with, of a
sensory kind, and partly as visual or auditory images.
Judging from the experience of other percipients it seems
Hkely that the different avenues used are not always
distinguishable even by the percipient himself ; and as
between different telepathic percipients, had we others to
compare with Professor Murray, we should probably find
that the comparative use of the different possible avenues
partly depended on the make up of the percipient's own
mind—on whether he was a good visualiser and so forth.
I imagine the following case to be a good example of
impressions coming in different ways in the same experi-
ment and gradually producing a comprehensible whole.
February 24, 1918.
42. Subject. Mr. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" Isle of Capri,
and on it is the old Master of Balliol [Strachan Davidson] and
my uncle [Arnold Toynbee] and they are reading the Bible,
and my uncle says what a good book it is, and Strachan
Davidson is chuckling."
xcn.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 245
Professor Mtjrbay. " I get T L on the Riviera
being very funny about the book of Samuel. [He]
had never read it. It's Italy I am sure, and it's some-
body being impressed by the Bible or talking about it as
though he had never read it before. I get the manner
of Strachan Davidson.—I should say it was at Naples,
or some place with the blue sea all about. Should say
it was Capri. Oh your uncle Arnold Toynbee."
(
[Contemporary note]. Arnold had never seen his uncle [who
died in 1883], and Mr. Murray had not known him.)
Here an idea, at first probably subconscious, of the dis-
cussion on the Bible must have introduced the irrelevant
recollection of a similar conversation on the Riviera
;
getting the manner of Mr. Strachan Davidson seems to
imply a visual or auditory impression or both ; and " the
blue sea all about " suggests a visual impression.
There is one case, Appendix No. 54, where Professor
Murray gets almost all the items of the agent's subject
correctly in detail—whether visually or not we do not
know—but complains that he " can't get it together. [He]
only get[s] fragments." Perhaps this only means that he
imagined there was some kind of story connecting the
items he got, whereas the agent had not indicated any.
Of course all we know directly about the percipient's
reception of the subject set by the agent is what the
former can teU us about his conscious impressions. That
subconscious work goes on in the production of the result
is a matter of inference, but I think an inference fully
justified. It can almost be proved true in certain cases,
and I am inclined to think that as a matter of fact
most of the work in producing Professor Murray's tele-
pathic impression is subconscious. As evidence I may
first refer again to the Doughty case. No. 26, (p. 231
above). Here, if our interpretation of the case is right,
a name must have been unconsciously apprehended and
unconsciously associated with the title of a book ; this
last then emerging faintly into consciousness. Sensory
images, with interpretation following (not preceding) them, as
in 33, (p. 236 above), strongly suggest subconscious manu-
246 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part
facture—indeed I think imply it. So does emotion felt
appropriately, but without realised cause, as in No. 38,
(p. 239 above). Again, when the impression comes to the
percipient's consciousness in the form of an appropriate
quotation which has not been in the agent's mind there
must, it would seem, be an idea behind it, prompting it,
and that idea must be subconscious as the percipient is
not aware of it.
Granting that the subconscious mind does play so
important a part in receiving and forwarding the subject
to be transmitted, we see that error may come in at
four stages. The subject may get through from the agent
to the percipient's subconscious mind in any degree of
incompleteness ;
^ it may there be further distorted by false
associations and inferences ; loss may occur again in emerg-
ing into consciousness owing to inhibitions or otherwise ;
and finally, the conscious mind may reject some ideas or
images, and misinterpret others.
For an example of conscious rejection of a perfectly
correct impression see Appendix No. 74, where Professor
Murray refuses to accept Lord Morley as part of the
" subject " because he happened to be reading his Re-
collections, and therefore imagined a normal origin for the
idea of him. I suspect the normal consciousness to have
been responsible for a hasty (and rather muddled) mis-
interpretation of a visual image of a haK-naked Arab
initially presented to it in the following case :
February 24, 1918.
43. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" AUenby.
British troops in Palestine and a sort of Arab man coming up
and standing half naked by a well."
Professor Murray. " This is the good Samaritan guiding
the English troops into Jericho. I don't know that he
is the good Samaritan. He might be a biblical figure,
coming up and speaking to General AUenby, and show-
ing the way." (" Anything he is near ? ") " Well a
well. I got him naked with no clothes."
I It is at this stage presumably that deficiencies in the agent as an
available source for impressions would operate adversely.
xcTi.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 247
[The impression here seems to begin with a visual image of
the half naked Arab which suggested the man that fell among
thieves on the way to Jericho, and thus the good Samaritan
who helped him.]
If telepathic impressions usually come through the
subconscious mind, which on other grounds than the
experiments under discussion seems to me likely, it is
possible that one important quality in a good telepathic
percipient may be a power of drawing easily on the
contents of his own subconscious mind.

/ quote here almost all the cases counted as successes
which have not already been quoted in the body of the
Report, and also cases of partial success or of failure which

I will
take me to some cavern for my hiding.'
"
Professor Murray. " Again I think this is poetry. I don't
think I shall get it—I've got that bird-droves thing
running in my head."
[The " bird droves thing " is the chorus in question. The
bird droves chorus in the Hippolytus had been chosen as a
subject for transmission by Mrs. Toynbee five years earlier
(see Mrs. Verrall's Report Proceedings, vol. xxix., p. 92), but
on that occasion was a failure. Professor Murray only getting
"something about Egjrpt and the NUe."]
46. Subject. Mr. W. Archer (agent) : "I think of my
brother walking off with the Red Cross collecting box."
Professor Murray (instantly). " My mind is full of the
pork pie incident." (Right).
[He took the collecting box in mistake for a pork pie which
he had bought.]
47. Subject. Mr. W. Archer (agent) : "I think of Nora
dancing the tarantella in The Doll's House [Ibsen's play]."
Professor Murray. "No. I felt I was on the verge of it,
but I can't get it.—No—I got a feeling of someone in a
play. No, I seemed to be groping at something in an
Ibsen play and could not quite get it."
August 1, 1915.

" I think of
the girl in the first story of Gosta Berling—the girl skating."
Professor Murray (at once). " This feels, generally speak-
ing, Scandinavian, presumably Iceland,^ and I feel as if
it was Miss Philpotts skating in Iceland, but I don't
think that's correct—oh it's a book. I should think it

" This is people
going into a sort of night-club and opium den, and they go in
out of Piccadilly Circus underground, and there are red sofas
and a person with a skull cap, and people dancing."
Pkoeessor Murray. " This is curious. I've got a smell of
some kind of incensy stuff—I should think it was opium
or hashish—and it's like a sort of opium den and people
coming into it—I can't get anything very clear. There
are sorts of settees or divans round the room (" What
colour ? ") " Red—I'm not getting it very clear. I
think I feel as if it were in London—people going down
into it." (" Where do you go out ? ") "I should say
Regent Circus."

" This is in
Palestine, and there is a crucifixion going on ; and it is not
Christ being crucified, and there's a cart going by with Christ
on it, like the Hardy poem."
Professor Murray. " There's something worrying about
this. It seems like the crucifixion but, if so, it's seen
from the point of view of a person who thinks it's the
crucifixion of a new criminal,^ as Pontius Pilate might
have thought. It's Christ seeing somebody else crucified
—in the earlier part of his life—No I can't get it."

in [Ibsen's] The DolVs House, with the doctor and Nora, and
doctor saying thanks for the light."
Professor Murray. " This is Norwegian. Never had a Nor-
wegian thing before [but see No. (47) above]—I've got
this. It's Ibsen. Dr. Rank. Scene between Dr. Rank
and Nora, where he says good-bye before he goes to die."
[This is the right scene.]
(Mr. Murray did not hold [Mrs. Toynbee's] hand and did not
look at her.)
[The same subject was agaui selected by the same agent on
September 14, 1916, thus: . ,

Professor Murray. " It's somebody who thinks he's going
to die. It's a play. It's the man in The DolVs House—
Dr. Rank. Yes, it's his final scene, where he comes in
and says good-bye to them and leaves the note in the
box."
Neither agent nor percipient appear to have realised that
the subject is being repeated. It is rather curious that though
Professor Murray on both occasions got the scene, he on
neither got the sentence in it—Dr. Rank's last words—which
characterised it for Mrs. Toynbee.]
53. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" Scene at thellm
beginnmg of Insulted and Injured where the very old maiDf
with the dead dog dies on the door step." I
Professor Murray. " A book. I don't think I've read it-

think, is Insulted and Injured—No, can't get his name."
("His name was Smith.") (Mr. Murray had not read the
book.) (Mr. Murray wanted to get another name and
[Mrs. Toynbee] wanted to call it Despised and Eejected.)
[I do not profess to understand this last sentence of the
note-taker's, but it evidently represents a discussion which may
J I
perhaps be of importance in view of the fact that the subject,
]|Or probably an earlier phase of the incident, ^ was selected again
I
by Mrs. Toynbee four months later (see above No. 1, p. 214).
,
The two should be compared. As in the DolVs House case
neither agent nor percipient seem to have observed the
repetition.]
54. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" This [is] a
scene in a Maupassant about a Frenchman who travelled to
Genoa and met a funny Italian girl in the train, and they
had supper in the hotel."
Professor Murray. " I think this is a book too. A train
on the Riviera—sort of Riviera atmosphere—somebody
a\vfully amused. I think he is a friend [? Frenchman]
being rather gallant and amused to a girl whom he
meets in the train—I think the girl is Italian—am sure

.t to be the only instance in the present series of inarticulate
sound deliberately included in the " subject." It occurred in

ing a strike meeting. I suppose it is somewhere—you
have fixed it somewhere. I guess outside the mill at
Chipping Norton."

ihe other hand, the action may have been characteristic of
Mr. MeUor's oratory.]
63. Subject. Mr. Mellor (agent) :
" I'm thinking of myself
254 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part
as taking my seat as a Labour member in the House of Com-
mons."
Professor Murray. " I think this is you again, but in
some rather odd atmosphere. I thmk you are in the
House of Commons. Yes—being introduced in the
House of Commons."
(As Mr MeKor had thought before. He thought it was
curious his being there.)
64. Subject. Mr. Basil Murray (agent) :
" I'm thinking of
the football match last winter between Charterhouse and Win-
chester in which Winchester beat Charterhouse."
Professor Murray. " I think it is a football match. Rather
big swell match. Charterhouse [and] some big other
school. For a guess I should say Wmchester."
(Mr. Murray got it at Charterhouse. It was at Charterhouse.
Basil thought of the people looking on and Mr. Murray got
the crowd.)
September 14, 1916.
65. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" I think of
scene in Romeo and Juliet—'
It is the nightingale and not the
lark.'
"
Professor Murray. " I've got this. It's '
Go not, sweet
love, it is not yet near day. It is the nightingale and
not the lark.'
"
66. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" I think of
the monk in his cell, and the boy in Tolstoi's Youth going to
confess to him."
(Noise.)
Professor Murray. " I've got it blurred—A sort of shot
—
I was going to say it's something in Gorki's L'Espion.
I feel as if it was Russian and an unhappy sort of boy
—(takes hand). I should guess Dostoievsky."
[The taking of the hand here did not help.]
67. Subject. Mr. Mellor (agent) :
" I'm thinking of Ben
Tillett addressing a meeting of strikers on Tower Hill on the
occasion on which he wished God to strike Lord Devonport
dead."
Professor Murray. " Oh—I think it's the crowd of people
XCII.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 255
praying that Lord Penrhyn—I think it was—might be
struck dead. Ben Tillett's meeting."
68. Subject. Mr. Mellor (agent) :
" I'm thinking of myself
startmg Jim Larkin's meeting in the Corn Exchange, when
;own and gown were divided, each sitting in his appropriate
alace—like talking to a tomb."
IS
'
1
Professor Murray. " I should say this was you at a
meeting, and there's something funny about the meeting
)i —as if it was divided into two bits, as if men on one
1- side and women on the other—but I don't think it is
men and women—I should say a strike meeting in the
!r Corn Exchange. I should say that Dublin strike
—
T something Irish. I don't think I can get it clearer—
I
don't think I was there." (" Anyone else ? ") " I
s. should say Jim Larkin."
69. Subject. Mr. Mellor (agent) :
" I'm thinking of the men
md women on strike at Chipping Norton standing up as
^ole and I walked down their centre, singing the Red Flag
—
I
n the Town Hall."
J
Professor Murray :
" Another strike, I'm sure of that-
Chipping Norton strike, something or other at Chipping
t
Norton. I think it's a crowd partiiig, as it were, and
J
people walking up between them—[I] don't particularly
get anything more—I don't know if I ought to get any
people ? I naturally think of people I know coimected
with the meeting." (" What doing ? ") " Cheering or
' i
waving flags—I don't think there's any trick about it—
not Abraham Lincoln or Napoleon, as Rosalind might say."
70. Subject. Mr. Mellor (agent) :
" I'm thinldng of C. D.
peaking on the suffrage to a very small meeting in the
^
..L.P. rooms at Bristol, standing on the platform with his
lands raised."
Professor Murray. " A faint impression of a small scrubby
meeting—a little meeting in a room somewhere—Well I
I
get an impression of a man awfully unlike Ben Tillett—
a sort of blundering, sUly, yet rather nice person
—
Quality of man and quality of meeting, working away—
at (raising hands). Having said that, I should guess
C. D."
256 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick
April 29, 1917.
71. Subject. Miss Aones Murray (agent): "I think of
Masefield in his little hospital boat coming up to the mouth
of Mudros harbour—watching the troops go o£E to Gallipoli."
Professor Murray. " Oh this is your poem in The Nation
about Masefield—It's the scene of the people setting out
for [? from] Mudros—Masefield watching them." ]
(No hands.) i
72. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent). " I think of
'
Denis sitting on the top of the roof of his hospital, smoking
cigars and teaching the night nurse to play piquet."
Professor Murray (pointed to Denis's photograph). " Denis \
somehow"—it's not anything in the war—sitting on the s
roof of a house and laughing—sitting on the roof of his
present hospital—seems cheery
—
"
(No hands.)
73. Subject. Mr. Tatham (agent) : " Xenophon's soldiers
coming in sight of the sea and saying OaXaTra, etc."
Professor Murray. " Not Xenophon's people coming to the a
sea and saying OdXarTu— ?
"
November 17, 1917.
74. Subject. Miss Agnes Mukray (agent) :
" I think of
Terence [Professor Murray's nephew] and Lord Morley sitting
under a p3rramid in Egypt discussing how long the war will last."
Professor Murray. " I've got two sorts of impression. I
One with Morley because of the book ^—that is wrong. [
The other with Terence. I don't see particularly what (
he is doing—I should say he was just sitting down.
No I can't get it clear."
[This experiment illustrates interference by the conscious self
j
in deciding what is likely to be right.]
75. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) :
" I think of
Anna [Karenina] and Vronsky sitting in their drawing-room at
their country house, being very much bored with each other,
and waiting for a visitor to come up the drive."
l(["The book" means] Lord MorJeijs Recollections, which [Professor ^
Murray] was reading.)
:xcn.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 257
Professor Murray. " I should say this was Russian-
people very uncomfortable-—a big, rich sort of house—
•
in a book. I should say it was Anna and Vronsky. I
have the feeling of the sort of misery when they are
living together, and she is getting jealous."
[This describes the atmosphere and surroundings of Anna
Karenina and Vronsky at their country house, but no such
scene as that given in the " subject " is, I think, actually
described in Tolstoy's book.]
76. Subject. Miss Agnes MtrRRAY (agent) : "I think of King
Arthur riding out on his horse [after] speaking to Guinevere
when she is [looking] out of the Convent [window] and it is
snowing hard."
Professor Murray. " I am getting this as a quotation.
'
That mist which ever since I saw
One crouchmg in the dust at Almesbury
Has (something) all the passes of the world.'
"
[In Tennyson's Passing of Arthur : King Arthur to Bedivere
after he has left the Convent and before the battle :
Yet let us hence, and find or feel a way
Thro' this blind haze, which ever since I saw
One lying in the dust at Almesbury,
Hath folded in the passes of the world.]
(Agnes was thinking to herself, " All day long the noise of
battle rolled " [from the same poem]. These verses apply to
[Arthur] when he was riding out with Bedivere after seeing
Guinevere.)
77. Subject. Lady Mary Murray (agent) :
" I have had in
my mind for some time George Trevelyan with his ambulance
falling back in the rout from the Bainsizza plateau."
Professor Murray. " I get Geoffrey Young with his leg
off, having to retreat with George Trevelyan in the
Italian retreat."
[Mr. Geoffrey Young did have to retreat under these
circumstances.]
November 18, 1917.
78. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) : "I think of Joan
258 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [part
of Arc going out to fight for the first time, and her watching
her horse beiag saddled."
Professor Murray. " I got a dim feeling of being in a
battle, and being very much afraid. It's the first battle.
—As a mere guess—No—I was going to say G , as
we had been talking about him."
79. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) :
" I think of the
scene in Sonia where they are all sitting round in a country
house, and the news comes that Violet's husband is killed."
Professor Murray. " This is a book. It seems to me
something commonplace. News of somebody being killed
comes to a party of people in a sort of big house.
Smart people. Oh it must be—it's not a Russian book,
and it's not a good book—doesn't make much impression
on me. It's English. I don't know if there is such a
scene in Sonia. It's the news of Loring's death."
[I cannot find any such scene as the agent describes in
Sonia. The news of the death of Violet's husband (Loring)
came otherwise. But part of the book, to which Loring be-
longs, is in a country house atmosphere.]
80. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) :
" Lucifer sitting
in Pandemonium and making a speech to all the fallen angels,
and he is saying '
Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.'
"
Professor Murray (as he walked into the room) : "Ye
something principalities and powers. It's Milton and
Lucifer."
[Both agent and percipient think of Milton's Lucifer making
a speech. The remark quoted by the agent was, however,
said in conversation with Beelezebub ; and the words attributed
to him by the percipient are not an exact quotation according
to the iiotes. It must, however, be remembered that the notes
have to be taken down in long hand and very quickly, so
that quotations and names are not always quite accurately
recorded. In this case, for instance, Professor Murray thinks
he said " Thrones. Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers."]
8L Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) : l^aXe /3aAe

Professor Murray. " This is Hughes of New College, the

82. Subject. Miss Agnes Mukray (agent) :
" Mr. Gladstone
visiting Lloyd George at 10 Downing Street, and trying to
point out to him the indiscretion of his Paris speech."
Professor Murray. " It's a dignified person severely re-
proving somebody—giving them an awful dressing down.
I should think it was Mr. Gladstone ; it's something
political. Can't think who Mr. Gladstone would be
likely to rebuke. Oh he's rebuking Lloyd George."
83. Subject. Mr. Maurice Jacks (agent) :
" The scene in
[Sir Walter Scott's novel] The Fair Maid of Perth where the
great battle takes place, and Connacher swims the river and
runs away."
Professor Murray. " I think this is somebody running
away in a battle, or being frightened. I think it is in a
book. Certainly not present fighting. I get a feeling of
a Highlander as if it was Waverley or something like
that, but I don't remember the scene."
84. Subject. Mr. Hammond (agent) : "I think of the bazaar
in Cairo, and Indian and Persian merchants, shop next to
shop, and selling their wares to tourists arriving."
Professor Murray. " Sort of crowded Eastern streets. I
should say as a guess shopkeepers in Jerusalem shutting
up their shops because the English troops are coming."
85. Subject. Miss Beatrice Rose (agent) :
" Scene in Lady
of [the] Lake ; and Roderick Dhu discovers himself and teUs
FitzJames he must protect himself with his own sword."
Professor Murray. " I believe I am going to do a quo-
tation. I don't think it is right :
—
'
Come one, come aU, this rock shall fly
From it's firm base as soon as I.'
What Roderick Dhu says in his fight with Fitzjames."
[Two connected scenes in The Lady of the Lake are mixed
up by both agent and percipient I think, namely, the one
where Roderick Dhu reveals to Fitzjames his identity, while
showing him that they are surrounded by his clansmen, and
260 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [PABT
the one where shortly afterwards, away from Roderick's dis-
trict, he challenges Fitzjames to single combat. The lines
quoted by Professor Murray were uttered by Fitzjames (not
Roderick) in the first scene when surrounded by Roderick's
followers. It is perhaps owing to this confusion that the per-
cipient doubted if his quotation was right.] , .
.,
86. Subject. Mr. Paton (agent) :
" Lord Rhonda, sailing
away in a boat from the Lusitania and saying he is going to
be equal with Satan's hypocritical and canting chief of the
staff."
Professor Murray. " Torpedoed ship—people getting away
in boats. Ought I to know who is getting away ?
Great big ship. I'm trying to think of anybody who
escaped from the Lusitania."
[I quote this because the percipient does not seem to have
grasped that the agent had the Lusitania in mind, although it
had been mentioned, until he inferred it from facts which he
divined though not mentioned by the agent—the facts that it
had been torpedoed and was a great big ship.]
February 24, 1918.
87. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" A little
Chinese person ui an old Chinese poem. Brother and sister-in-
law were unkind ; father and mother were dead. By a river."
Professor Murray. " I am either not getting it at all, or
it is a new sort of place. It is not Russian—don't think
it is. WeU it's something like [a] Russian boy. It's
something like a small unliappy Russian child who has
been unldndly treated like a Gorki, and I think it
beside the Volga like Gorki. I think it's Chinese. I
mix it up with a Chinese girl crying because her feet
are being bent. Chinese motherless or fatherless child
being maltreated by her relations."
(Mr. Murray mixed it as to whether it was a girl or a boy.
Rosalind [Mrs. Toynbee] and Lady Mary had discussed [which
it was].)
88. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" Oreenmantle
[by Buchan]. Where the German peasant woman takes them in
in a snow-storm."
xcn.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 261
Professor Murray. " This is something out of a book. I
don't think I have read it. It's not Russian. It's got
no particular [national] character. It's a snow-storm. It's
somebody—I think it's a peasant woman—giving shelter
to a spy. I think it's a German peasant woman. I'm not
sure. I think it's a German woman." (" What sort of
a spy ? ") " I think he is English. I think it is a
book of adventure."
(In the book he is a spy.)
89. Subject. Lady Mary Murray (agent) :
" People in the
circle of Dante's Inferno who are driven by the wind all the
time."
Professor Murray. " I've got quite clear the Keats lines :—
'
Pale were the lips I kissed and fair the form
I floated with about that melancholy storm.'
"
The sonnet on [A Dream, after Reading Dante's Episode
of Paulo and Francesca.]
(About 6 back Lady Mary had got a picture of [Paolo] and
Francesca. Mr. Murray got the picture of the people being
driven by the storm.)
[The episode of Paolo and Francesca is of course a very
important part of Dante's account in the Inferno, Canto V, of
the '
Circle '
referred to by Lady Mary Murray.]
June 16, 1918.
90. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" Rousseau,
when he was a servant in the house in Turin and the thing
was stolen."
Professor Murray. " I get an impression—1st, that low
French newspaper that Wade Gery was talking about.
No, I think I am getting confused with your boys who
stole. I get it much confused. A nasty sort of French
person stealing. I don't think—It's a sort of artist
educated person—He's a lacquey of somebody's. It's
like GU Bias, but I don't think it is [him]. It's some-
body of that sort of date. Oh ! it's Rousseau, when he
stole the ribbon, etc."
(Rosalind had got the impression of a bad atmosphere.)
262 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick [part
July 14, 1918.
91. Subject. Mr. Penmorlan Main (agent) :
" Dante meeting
Beatrice on the bridge at Florence."
Professor Murray. " This isn't Greek, but it's high poetry
of some sort. It's not Greek—Is it—It's Dante somehow.
Is it Dante meeting Beatrice ?
"
92. Subject. Mr. Penmorlan Main (agent) :
" The death of
Hereward the Wake, when he's ringed round by his enemies.
Kills them one by one."
Professor Murray. " This isn't ? —keep getting—the death
of somebody. No—is it a sort of—I'm getting it very
confused, but I feel as if it were something early Saxon
or Norse—somebody with a battle-axe against crowds of
people."
93. Subject. Mr. Penmorlan Main (agent) :
" Theseus and
Heracles, when Theseus is trying to persuade him not to
commit suicide."
Professor Murray. " Is this your own thing ? I got an
impression of suggestion. Greek, I think—I should think
Heracles talking with Theseus."
94. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" OBlomoff
lying in bed, and a lot of curious visitors coming to see him."
Professor Murray. " I think it's a legend or fairy story or
something—It's like the levee of a French king—but it's
somebody in bed—people coming in—streams of people
—
but I think it's a sort of legend or something I don't
know."
(Curious book—allegory.) [Book by Ivan Goutcharofi.]
95. Subject. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee (agent) :
" I'm thinking
of the scene in Marie Claire, where she finds that nun Soeur
Marie Aimee crying."
Professor Murray. " This is a book—it's not English, not
Russian—It's rather a—I think there are nuns in it
—
there are a lot of people—either a school or a laundry
—
and one of the nuns weeping—I think it's French. Oh
it's a scene in Marie Claire, near the beginning—I can't
remember it, but it's something like that—it's in the
XCII.] Experiments in Thought-Tra7isference 263
place where she goes—one of the nuns crying—a double
name—no I can't get the [name] Marie Therese."
96. Subject. Lady Maey Murray (agent) :
" A monastery
that we slept in the first night in Peloponese with six beds
round."
Professor Murray. " I think this is in Greece. I think it
is the place where we were so afraid that the arch-priest
meant to sleep with us."
(Right.)
97. Subject. Countess of Carlisle (agent) :
" The Crimean
soldiers after their return receiving their medals from Queen
Victoria at [the] Horse Guards."
Professor Murray. " Is it the King givmg V.C.'s and
things to people ? Yes [I] think it's an investiture of
some sort."
98. Subject. Countess of Carlisle (agent) :
" Sinking of the
Lusitania."
Professor Murray. " I've got this violently. I've got an
awful impression of naval disaster. I should think it
was the torpedoing of the Lusitania."
99. Subject. Miss Wenifred Roberts (agent): "I'm thinking
of Caliban on Setebos, [Caliban] sitting in a cave thinking about
things." :
Professor Muhray. " I think it's a poem. Is it a scene in
a poem or a whole poem?" ("A scene.") It's like
Browning—I think it's Caliban tearing the crabs."
(in Caliban on Setebos.) [The agent's description applies to
the whole poem, of which the crabs incident is a part.]
August 17, 1918.
99a. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) :
" I'U thmk of
Shelley nearly being drowned, and when he was pulled out [he]
said, '
Oh what a pity. I wanted to see what the next world
was like."
(Interruptions, windows opened, also noise outside.)
Professor Murray. " No, nothing at all."
[This is quoted because the same subject was given by the
same agent in almost the same words in December 1915, and
students may like to compare. See Mrs. Verrall's Report,
264 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick [pab'j
Proceedings, xxix., p. 105. On that occasion Professor Murraj
was successful.] ^

numbered, and one soldier stood up and said '

101. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent): I think of
Joan of Arc when she was a little girl, sitting in the garden
with aU the apple blossom and sewing with her mother."
Professor Murray. " This comes to me like a scene—don't
think it's a picture. Some children sitting under apple
trees in blossom. I should think French, but I'm not
sure—not getting it clear. One of them sewing, bending
down over sewing."
[I quote this as a case of purely visual impression, like a
picture, with no interpretation.]
102. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) :
" I think of J. M
A. H., and B. and I crossing in a little gondola from VUla
Serbelloni to Varenna on a very beautiful day."
Professor Murray. " I think it's Italian. I'm not getting
it clearly. I think it's that place on the Italian Lake
that we stayed at—a beautiful hotel on Como—Vill
Serbelloni ? No, I can't get anything very clear—To
many of them—conjurers—buying umbrellas—crossing
the lake in a steamer." |ariai
[I quote this as an example of the place intended having
been apprehended, small remembered associations with it
present themselves. But the one thought of by the agent does
not emerge. Perhaps it had been normally forgotten and the
telepathic impression was too weak to force it forward.]
102a. Subject. Miss Agnes Murray (agent) : "I think of
the boy in [Masefield's] Daffodil Fields arriving in the camp in
America, finding them aU drinking, swearing, gambling, and
him being given a beautiful horse."

Professor Murray. " I think it's Masefield—I think it'Sj^i^.,

else—I'm sure it's very nearly that. I think it's Mase-

of cursing and swearing and gambling and someone
[

f Masefield's own life for a similar experience of one of his
eroes. Masefield was once bar-tender in a New York saloon. 1

his forehead, trying to recover a dream he's had—

out of a book, the only river they could have been walking
by was the Arno.]

SOME REMINISCENCES OF FIFTY YEARS'
PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.!
By Sm William Baekett, F.R.S.
" Science is bound by the everlasting law of honour to face fearlessly
every problem that can fairly be presented to it."
—
Lord Kelvin.
Just fifty years ago this month I first began a serious and
systematic investigation of psychical phenomena, and was
so impressed with the supreme importance of the subject
that so far as my time and strength permitted I have
continued the investigation to the present time with
unabated interest. Of course, other and far abler men
both preceded me and worked contemporaneously with me ;
to some of these I wiU refer directly.
Early Psychical Reseakchees.
By psychical research I mean the critical investigation,
and, where possible, the verification of alleged supernormal
phenomena, or of hitherto unrecognised human faculties.
So far as regards narratives of spiritistic phenomena,
these of course go back to remote ages, and records are
to be found in many different countries. Years ago
Andrew Lang had several conversations with me on the
value of the S.P.R. devoting some time to historical
research on this subject, for he attached great importance
to the fact of the wide diffusion, both in space and time,
of phenomena similar to those we are now engaged in
investigating. 2
1 Read at a Private Meeting of the Society on June 17, 1924.
^ The laborious and admii-able work by William Hewitt, entitled
History of the Supernatural, is well known and should be consulted by
all who are interested in the history of psychical research. It made a
great impression on me when I read it some fifty years ago. The term
supernatural should, however, have been supernormal, as all phenomena
—
however novel and inexplicable they may appear to be—are really
natural ;
only God is above and beyond Nature.
276 Sir William Barrett [part
Biblical references show that Spiritualism was rampant
in the early history of the Jews ;
King Saul himself being
a notable spiritualist, consulting his medium at Endor.
As I have said elsewhere, before science had established a
universal reign of law or of the great world order, the
pursuit of these spkitistic phenomena was justly con-
demned by the ancient prophets as hkely to lead to !
intellectual and moral confusion. It seems probable, how-
ever, that many of the prophetic writings were done
automatically, as in the book of Chronicles David says
that the instructions he gave regarding the building of the
Temple were not his own ideas, for " the Lord made me
understand in writing by his hand upon me." ^
One of the first psychical researchers of whom I can
find any report was the learned and famous German
Jesuit, Fr. A. Kircher. In his Latin foUos, published in
j
1640, he discusses the cause of the motion of the '
pendule
explorateur ' (a little ball or ring suspended by a string j
;
held by one hand) and of the forked divining rod, both h
of which at that time were the subject of acute con-
troversy. Kircher showed that if the '
pendule ' or the : i
rod were held, not by the hand, but by a rigid support, ii
no motion occurs under any circumstances. He was thus \
led to discover the principle of unconscious muscular i
action, a discovery claimed two centuries later by the |
distinguished French chemist, Chevreul, and by Dr. W. B. |
Carpenter subsequently. i
Some twenty years after Kircher's work appeared, one i
of the founders of the Royal Society, the Hon. Robert i
Boyle, '
the son of the Earl of Cork and the Father of s
Chemistry,' in his Philosophical Works discusses the I
question of the divining rod, and urges further experi- s
ments to test its value in the discovery of mineral veins, ]
for the evidence he collected was conflicting. He remarks t
that eye-witnesses, who were far from credulous, told him s
of the great value of the rod, and one gentleman in whose
hand it moved when he passed over a vein of ore, affirmed p
" that the motion of his hand did not at all contribute
to the inclination of the rod, but that sometimes when
1 See 1 Chron. xxviii. 19. ... .
j
xcn.] Reminiscences of Fifty Years 277
lie held it very fast it would bend so strongly as to
break in his hand." ^
In one of the first volumes of the Philosophical Trans-
actions of the Royal Society Boyle asks the question whether
anyone could inform him " whether diggers do meet with
the subterraneous demons which are said to inhabit the
lead mines of Somersetshire, and in what shape and
manner they appear ?
" In a subsequent number the famous
Dr. Glanvil, also a Fellow of the Royal Society, rephed
that he lived near the lead mines in the Mendips, and
that whilst the miners heard the knockings of the demons,
and by following the directions of these knockings were led
to plenty of ore, nevertheless he had not found anyone who
had actually seen the demons or gnomes themselves, and
therefore he could not describe their appearance or habits.^
A curious fact is that these knockings are heard and the
gnomes beheved in by lead miners in various parts of
England and Ireland. The simple scientific explanation of
these sounds I think I have discovered, but it would take
me too far to go into the m^atter here. The point I want
to bring out is that Boyle and Glanvil and many of the
early Fellows of the Royal Society were true psychical
researchers ; as Prof, de Morgan has said, " they set
themselves to work to prove aU things, that they might
hold fast to that which was good ;
they bent themselves
to the question whether sprats were young herrings and
whether a spider could crawl through the powder of a
unicorn's horn." They enquired whether there was any
value in magnetical cures and any good in Kenelm Digby's
sympathetic powder. Even a century later the great Sir
Isaac Newton describes in a series of letters—which I have
seen, as they have been preserved by my friend, Mx.
Blayny Balfour—how he spent much time and money in
besting the value of certain alchemical powders which were
3aid to turn lead into gold.
The early spiritualists really took the method of these
pioneers of physical science. Though they might have
1 Boyle's Philosophical WorJcs (1738), vol. i., p. 172 and 173.
^Phil. Trans., No. 19, Nov. 1666 ; and GlanvU's reply is in Phil.
Trans., vol. iii., 1668.
278 ' Sir William Barrett [part
been frequently too credulous, yet what they aimed at was
to collect facts however improbable they appeared to be,
and as De Morgan says, " The spiritualists beyond a doubt
are in the track that has led to all advancement in
physical science ;
they have the spirit and the method of
the grand time when paths had to be cut through the
uncleared forests in which it is now the daily routine to
walk. Their spirit was that of universal examination,
wholly unchecked by fear of being discovered in the
investigation of nonsense." ^
One of the earhest Fellows of the Royal Society, to
whom I have aheady referred, was Dr. Joseph Glanvil
;
he was chaplain to Charles II. and a prebendary of
Worcester. The historian Lecky describes him as " a man
of incomparable abihty." Speaking of one of Glanvil's
works, Lecky remarks, " it would be difficult to find a
work displaying less of credulity and superstition than this
treatise." Glanvil's Saducismus Triumpliatus, pubhshed at
the end of the seventeenth century, discusses the evidence;
concerning witches and apparitions, and gives the fuUest
report of those remarkable poltergeist phenomena known
as the '
Demon of Tedworth ' or the " Disturbances in
Mr. Mompesson's house in Wiltshire." Glanvil truly
remarks that " matters of fact well proved ought not to
be denied because we cannot conceive how they could be
performed. Deceit and fallacy will only warrant a greater
care and caution in examining." Glanvil had the warm
support not only of Robert Boyle, but also of the famous
Henry More.
In his record of the hauntings of the Epworth parsonage
in 1716, and in his endeavour to get first-hand evidence of
other supernormal phenomena, John Wesley—as Mr. J.
Arthur Hill has said
—" would have made an excellent
member of the S.P.R.," and it is certainly surprising—as
Mr. Hill adds
—" to find in an earnestly religious man of
that day, such as John Wesley, so much critical interest
in our subject."

s fellow-worker, Miss Ramsden, shows that the Duke was
i,
really a keen psychical researcher, for he critically
t
exammed several psychic cases, among others the well-
II
known dream of a Cornish farmer, WiUiams, who on
if
May 11, 1812, woke his wife and told her that he had
e dreamt he had seen a man shot in the lobby of the House
0 of Commons, and described his appearance, etc. The
1, dream was repeated, and told to several people ; sub-
e sequently it was found that the details of the dream
exactly corresponded with the facts connected with the
0 assassination of Mr. Percival, the Chancellor of the
;
Exchequer, on the eleventh May, the very evening Williams
)f had his dream. ^ Percival's descendant—my venerable
n friend. Miss Percival " of Chobham—has also given me a
1 written contemporary record of this remarkable dream.
a Among the Fellows of the Royal Society who warmly
is advocated the investigation of psychical phenomena, was
it Dr. Mayo, F.R.S., Professor of Physiology in King's
le College, London, whose witings on the subject, pubhshed
it about the middle of the last century, are well worth
n perusal, containing as they do many new and interesting
a facts, which at the present day seem little known,
y This period was also notable for the great interest
0 excited by mesmeric phenomena. The remarkable report
le of the committee appointed by the medical section of the
!! French Academy of Sciences on this subject, together with
n the amazmg phenomena to which they testify, excited
IS widespread interest. Eminent Enghsh physicians and
surgeons, such as Dr. EUiotson of St. Thomas' Hospital
re and Dr. Esdaile, presidency surgeon in Calcutta, made
}f numerous contributions to our knowledge on this subject,
J. especially as regards the therapeutic and analgesic power
it of mesmerism. Esdaile, as is weU known, conducted a
IS very large number of major surgical operations, absolutely
i)f painlessly, under the mesmeric trance ; and if the use of
1 3hloroform as an anaesthetic had not been discovered
ibout this time, the value of mesmeric trance in surgical
\ aperations would have been universally acknowledged. But
1 See p. 335 in Lady Gwendolen Ramsden's Correspondence of Two
Brothers from 1809-1819 (Longmans & Co.).
280 Sir William Barrett [part
in spite of the eminence of Dr. Elliotson and others,
mesmerism was nevertheless denounced by the profession
as a whole, and the Lancet called it " an odious fraud."
It was not until Braid of Manchester employed the word
hypnotism instead of mesmerism—and thus dissociated the
subject from Mesmer, who was more or less of a quack
—
that the medical profession began to treat the subject
with less contempt. Braid also gave a reasonable explana-
tion of the phenomena, but subsequently this proved to be
inadequate to account for all the facts. The valuable
experimental work of the continental hypnotists, and of
our own members, Edmund Gurney, Dr. Lloyd Tuckey
and Dr. Milne Bramwell, have now placed hypnotic treat-
ment among the recognised therapeutic agencies of the
medical profession.
Foundation of the Society eor Psychical Research.
Some twenty-five years before our Society was founded
a few of the younger Fellows of Trinity CoUege, Cam-
bridge, chief of whom was Mr. B. F. Westcott—afterwards
the famous Bishop of Durham—started a '
Ghost Society
'
very much on the lines of our S.P.R. In our Journal for
April last year I gave the object and the brief history of
this Society, which included among its members several
Cambridge graduates who subsequently became eminent, such
as Archbishop Benson, Prof. Hem-y Sidgwick, and others.
I will hand over for preservation among the archives of
our Society the original document of the '
Cambridge
Ghost Club '
(as it was called), given to me by my friend
the Archdeacon of Dublin.
As regards the foundation of our own Society, I have
corrected elsewhere the misunderstanding which Prof.
Richet and others have fallen into ;
^ and also I wrote, by
request, a fuller account of the early history of our
Society. 2 Though it is true I happened to be the chief
instrument in the foundation of our Society in 1882—and
of kindred societies in Canada and the United States in

1884—^yet the high position and respect the S.P.R. has
won is chiefly due to Sidgwick, Myers, and Gurney, the
three great pillars upon which the edifice of our Society
was originally built. These eminent men were unlike in
many ways : Sidgwick by his adhesion to the S.P.R.
greatly impressed the academic world, for his influence,
wisdom, and caution were widely recognised ;
Myers by his
enthusiasm, briUiant talents, and profound intuition, was
the corner stone of the S.P.R. till his death in 1901 :
Gurney with his industry and immense range of knowledge
was essential to the early progress and stabihty of our
Society.
Crookes was really the first scientific man to devote his
experimental skill, from 1870 to 1874, to the critical
investigation of the physical phenomena of spnitualism.
It is pitiful to think of the scientific ostracism to which he
was subjected and over which his genius eventually
triumphed. I am not, however, surprised at the Royal
Society refusing to publish his spiritistic investigations, for,
a few years later, my modest paper read before the British
Association in 1876 was refused pubKcation by scientific
ji societies, of which I was member, on the very natural
J
ground that science dealt with the evidence furnished by
1^
our recognised senses, whereas my paper dealt either with
.
phenomena which transcended the usual channels of sense
or with phenomena that transcended the material world.
Eaely Steps in Psychical Research.
Many friends have asked me how I first became
interested in psychical research. Perhaps I may be for-
given for relating an old story. Between the years 1862
and 1867 I was assistant to Professor Tyndall at the
Royal Institution. The atmosphere surrounding my early
years there was entirely opposed to any belief in psychical
phenomena. Faraday, to whom electrical engineers owe
the source of all their vast undertakings—yet who Hved and
died a poor man—Faraday I saw almost daily, before he
left the Royal Institution and went to Live at the Hampton
282 Sir William Barrett [part;
Court Cottage given to him by the Prince Consort. I can
never forget the debt I owe that famous man for his
generous kindness and guidance to a young ignoramus Uke
myself. Faraday had pubhshed about 1855 his famous
experiment on table-turning, showing how imconscious
muscular effort accounted for what he saw. A little later
he publicly declined to sit with the medium Home, saying
he had lost too much time over such matters already.
Tyndall also had denounced spkitualism as an imposture.
Both Huxley and Herbert Spencer were frequent visitors
to the Royal Institution laboratory, and both of these
eminent men treated all psychical phenomena with con-
temptuous indiiJerence. Among other frequent visitors was
an Irishman, Mr. John Wilson, who invited me to spend
my vacations at his place in County Westmeath. For a
couple of years I did so, and found to my astonishment
that Mr. Wilson was a firm behever in—and experienced
investigator of—mesmerism, as it was then called. He
showed me some most extraordinary experiments upon a
sensitive subject from his estate. I was naturally in-
credulous and asked to be allowed to repeat the experi-
ments myself, selecting another subject. We found a
young uneducated Irish girl, who proved to be extremely
sensitive. In the mesmeric trance—in spite of every pre-
caution that I took to prevent deception—whatever sensa-
tions I felt, whether of touch, taste or smell, were trans-
ferred to the subject, and, moreover, ideas and words
which I thought of were reproduced more or less accurately
by the hypnotised subject. A brief account of some of
these experiments may be found in the first volume of our
Proceedings, p. 240.
When I returned to London I repeated these experi-
ments with a couple of boys whom I found susceptible to
hjrpnosis. These experiments revealed to me the extra-
ordinary power of either verbal or silent suggestion upon
the hypnotised subject. For instance, placing a pan- of
shoes upon the table, I told one of the lads that I was
going to float round the room and pointed to the position
I was supposed to have reached near the ceiling. Then,
clapping my hands, I suggested that I was safely back in.
xcii.] Reminiscences of Fifty Years 283
my shoes on the table. The boy stared at me with
increduhty and related afterwards, both to me and to
others, that he had really seen me floating round the
room. A similar result was obtained by me with another
subject when I was on a visit to America in 1884. Hence
I was led to believe that spiritualistic phenomena, when
not fraudulent, were really due to the hallucination of the
observer ;
that, in fact, the phenomena, such as Home
floating out of the room or putting his hands into the
fire, were really subjective and not objective. I had been
in correspondence with Mr. Crookes on scientific matters so
far back as the year 1864, when I published in the Philo-
sophical Magazine my first scientific research. In 1870
Crookes began his experiments with the famous medium
D. D. Home ; soon after this he wrote to me (in a letter
which I have kept) as follows : -
''May 14, 1871.
Dear Mk. Barkett,
I must have some conversation with you respecting
these obscure phenomena. If you can help me to form
anything like a physical theory I should be delighted. At
present all I am quite certain about is that they are
objectively true. I have had all my wits about me when
at a seance, and the only person who appeared to be in
a state of semi-consciousness is the medium himself. The
other evening I saw Home handling red-hot coals as if
they had been oranges. Will you favour me with a visit
one evening when you are disengaged.
Very truly yours,
;
. William Crookes."
I had several interviews with Crookes, but unfortunately
lad no opportunity of any sitting with Home, and a year
)r two later I was appointed to the Chan- of Physics at
.he Royal College of Science, Dubhn. In 1874 I made
ny first acquaintance with the physical phenomena of
piritualism, and was able to put to the test my pre-
•onceived theory of hallucination, which was gradually
lispelled, and I became convinced of the objective reality
284 Sir William Barrett [part
of the phenomena. It so happened that one of the
London weekly reviews had sent me about this time a
number of books on spiritualism to review, and in a
lengthy review I suggested the hallucination hypothesis,
but in a postscript added that this view was open to
serious doubt.
The record of my experiments in Ireland on the physical
phenomena of spiritualism was read before the S.P.R., and
wiU be found in our Proceedings, vol. iv., p. 25, etc.
I was singularly fortunate in these early experiments on
physical phenomena, as the mediums were personal friends,
and the experiments took place in fvll light either in my
own house or in that of my friends. After this lapse of
time I think I may mention without indiscretion that the
name of the young medium I called Florrie was Miss Clark
;
her father, a leading London sohcitor, had taken a fur-
nished house near my residence in Kingstown. The house
belonged to ]\Ir. James Wilson (brother of my Westmeath
friend), who asked me to call on ]VIr. Clark. Mr. WUson
was the father of the late Commander-in-Chief, Henry
Wilson, an old student of mine. My prolonged investigation
of Florrie Clark, in full daylight, and other experimentsi
with the family of the Landers (one of the leading photo-
graphers in Dublin), so impressed me with the supreme
importance of the whole subject that I determined to let
no opportunity pass of pursuing these investigations.
Shortly afterwards I prepared a paper on the various
psychical phenomena I had witnessed ;
this was accepted
by and read before the British Association in 1876.
^
Verbatim reports of my paper were given both in the
local and the spiritualist journals of Sept. 1876.2 Jt wil]
be seen from the reports of this paper that, while some
notable scientific men such as Dr. W. B. Carpenter vigor-
ously opposed my paper, others still more notable spoke ir
my support ;
such, for example, as Mr. (afterwards Su
William) Crookes and the late Lord Rayleigh (both of whon

subsequently became Presidents of the Royal Society), also
the president of the Section, IVIr. A. R. Wallace, and the
distinguished antliropologist Col. Lane Fox, who afterwards
became General Pitt-Rivers. I may add that a warm
letter in support of my paper was received by me from
the famous astronomer who subsequently became Sir
Wilham Huggins, also a President of the Royal
Society.i The main object of my paper was a plea for a
scientific committee to examine the validity of the evidence
that I had adduced on behalf of what appeared to be
thought-transference and other supernormal phenomena,
especially those relating to spirituahsm. Unfortunately, in
the violent dispute which followed between Carpenter and
Wallace, my resolution was lost sight of.
For weeks a great controversy ensued in the London
Times, which, like all the other newspapers (with the
exception of the Spectator), poured ridicule upon my
daring to bring such a contemptible subject before the
British Association. Among other of my vigorous opponents
in The Times were Professors Lankester and Donkin (now
Su- Ray and Sir Bryan); both of these distinguished men
are still living and have not abated their hostihty to the
subject. Here it is interesting to note that in 1876 I
ventured to state m The Times that before we could hope
to arrive at any definite conclusion as to the origm of
spirituahstic phenomena, we must first ascertain whether
such a thing as the transfusion of thought between sitter
and medium really existed and its extent; and, secondly,
vvhether such a thing as clakvoyance or a transcendental
perceptive power had any foundation in fact ? Both
these questions have now been answered in the affirmative,
ind this renders the above caution the more necessary.
' Book tests '
show that Richet's theory of cryptesthesia,
a^hich seems to be another name for clairvoyance, needs
serious consideration. The critical examination of Stainton
Closes' script by our member Mr. Trethewy has shown
ihat many apparently spirit communications are transcripts

he courage to support my B.A. paper, no less than four received the

of some matter which had been written or printed, it
may be long ago, and, as a rule, only to be found m
places inaccessible to the medium. Nothing seems able to
elude the prying eyes of the transcendental self, whether
it be incarnate or discarnate. In many sittings of to-day
the same thing holds good.^ For example, that exceUent
but illiterate medium, Sloan, of Glasgow, when m a trance
state will often give details concerning a sitter whom he
has never seen before and whose name even he does not
know, yet in subsequent investigation many of the facts
stated by the medium will be found printed, either in
Who's Who or other books to which the medium appears
to have had no possibility of access.
Hence, with these and other facts known to us, we must
realize that, however trustworthy may be the evidence we
obtain of supernormal phenomena, the interpretation of that
evidence may in time alter—as our experience grows wider,
and our knowledge of human psychology more extensive
and profound. Albeit I am personally convinced that the
evidence we have published decidedly demonstrates (1) the
existence of a spiritual world, (2) survival after death,
and (3) of occasional communications from those who have
passed over.
It will be obvious that in the present paper I cannot
give even an outline of the evidence that has led me
to the foregoing conclusions. The so-caUed physical
phenomena afford striking evidence of amazing super-
normal power, but no proof of the survival of human
personality can be derived from them. In fact, many
people believe that they are simply due to the 'psychic
force
'
of the medium and sitters ;
however, this is an
opinion I do not share. Even the so-called 'ectoplasm,'
which is seen issuing in certain cases from the body of
the medium and sometimes taking human shape, may
be attributed to some mysterious, unknown, and un-,
conscious power possessed by the medium. There can be
little doubt that the source of the ectoplasm is m some
way derived from the human organism; but I believe

an unseen and intelligent supernormal agency external to
the medium causes this ectoplasm to take definite forms
and apparent vitality. I myself have not had the oppor-
tunity of ever witnessing these ectoplastic phenomena,
and therefore I defer to the opinion of such experienced
and critical observers as the late Dr. Geley, Prof. Richet,
and others.
Physical Phenomena.
As regards the ordinary physical phenomena I have
had a long series of experiments with various mediums,
going back to the time of Dr. Slade in 1876. Slade
always sat with me in broad daylight, and though I
have little doubt that he not unfrequently resorted to
trickery, yet there was also no doubt he had genuine
and remarkable mediumistic powers ; his so-called exposure
by Prof. Ray Lankester was quite inconclusive. Those
who are interested in the matter will find in Stainton
Moses's Psydiography, pp. 104-110, a record of some of
my experiments with Slade, in part quoted from the
London Tiines of September 1876, and also a careful
report written by my friend Mr. Conrad Cook, who
accompanied me to a sitting with Slade in August 1876.
The only case of '
materiahzation '
witnessed by me,
which seemed to be inexplicable by fraud, occurred with
the medium. Husk, many years ago. It may be worth
while describing this experiment as it has never been
published.
Mr. Wm. de Morgan had kindly lent Myers and myself
ills studio in Cheyne Row, an almost bare room, furnished
fnth a small deal table about 3 feet by 5 feet, and a
:ew chairs. After dinner Myers brought Husk to Cheyne
Row in a hansom cab, and we immediately sat round
:he table. There were six present including the medium.
^iVilham de Morgan and his sister (being sceptics), were
^ijjlaced in control of the medium, whose feet were tied
)0 the legs of the table, and his hands were grasped by
'he sitter on each side. Mrs. de Morgan (their mother),
at facing Myers, and I sat at the other end of the
288 Sir William Barrdt. [part
table and had control of the light. After the wrists of
all present had been loosely joined together by silk
thread, I blew out the candle and phenomena very soon
occurred. The medium went into a trance, lights, very
lilte fireflies, were seen darting about over our heads,
movement of some objects in the room was heard, and
a deep guttural voice spoke to us calling himself 'John
King.' In reply to our request he said he would try
and show himself. A violent convulsion of the medium
occurred, and suddenly right in front of me appeared a
clothed human figure from the waist upwards : the lower
part of the body might have been concealed by the
table. The face was illuminated by a bluish light which
seemed to issue from an object held in the hand of the
materialized figure. The face was undoubtedly a living
one, for I saw its eyes open and close and its lips move ;
I asked who it was and the guttural voice said "John
King." It was a dark bearded and rather unpleasant
face, quite unlike that of the medium. I exclaimed,
" Do you all see the figure ? I am going to light the
candle," and immediately risked doing so. The figure vanished
the moment the match was struck, and the medium
was found in deep trance, lying back in his chair and
groaning : when the medium had recovered he was sent
home in a cab. On comparing notes, each sitter described
the face accordmg to the different aspects it presented
from his or her position at the table. We found upon
experimenting that it was impossible to reproduce the
figure by leaning over the table, nor could the medium
have put on a mask, as his hands were held the whole
time and the tying of his legs and wrists were found
intact. De Morgan asked Myers and myseK to come
the next morning and see if we could in any way imitate
what we had seen. Though de Morgan remained somewhat
sceptical, Myers and I both agreed that it was extremely
difficult to explain the phenomena by trickery on the
part of the medium, who, moreover, was found dee^ply
entranced a few seconds later. \
With regard to the so-called 'spirit photographs,'
I have been extremely sceptical of their genuineness
SCI
tip

T xcn.] Reminiscences of Fifty Years 289
until quite lately. Recently, however, experiments con-
ducted by my friend Mr. de Brath, in one of which he
kindly allowed me to take part, appear to afford in-
dubitable evidence of supernormal psychic photography.
This conclusion confirms the opinion held by some expert
and critical experimenters, who have discussed their
results with me. Of course faked '
spirit photographs
'
abound and are easy to produce ; whilst heartless rascals
exist who prey upon the grief of a credulous sitter.
Healthy scepticism has therefore been inevitable and
wise. But we shall never arrive at any knowledge of
the conditions requisite for these and other marvellous
psychic phenomena, until hostile increduhty becomes no
longer possible. Then, as Sir John Herschel says, " occur-
rences which, according to received theories ought not to
e; happen, are the facts which serve as clues to new dis-
coveries." ^
These disputable subjects illustrate the importance of our
society recognizing the fact that a difference of opinion
—
a right and a left wing—will necessarily have to exist
among its different members. I mean that there are some
who have been convinced at first hand, from their own
i){
experience, that the existence of certain psychical pheno-
jijimena—especially those associated with spirituahsm—admit of
ied
ole
no doubt whatever, and are impatient with those who have
not had this experience and are therefore more inclined to
be cautious and even sceptical. The former class of our
members wish to push forward and perhaps attach less
importance to conclusive experimental evidence than they
did at first : the latter class wish to go much more slowly
and proceed step by step. This difference of opinion,
though healthy, naturally leads to a divergence of interest
in our subject, and from time to time threatens to break
up the solidarity of our society.
Nor must we forget that psychical research, as stated
in the original articles of our societj^ embraces far more
than spiritistic phenomena, and I hope that our research
officers will ever bear in mind the varied objects of our
^Discourse on Natural Philosophy, section 5.

society, which will be found printed in the first volume of
our Proceedings.
Personally I am very anxious that earnest attention
should be given to the so-called '
Reichenbach Phenomena,'
wherein certain sensitives after long immersion in complete
darkness perceive a luminosity emanating from the poles of
a magnet and also from the human fingers. I have pub-
lished in the Philoso-phical Magazine, and also in the early
volumes of our Proceedings, the experiments which led me
to the conviction that such phenomena do really occur
under suitable conditions.
Another point, which I hope will sooner or later be the
subject of further experiment, is the question of the old
mesmeric hypothesis of '
effluence,' for which both Gurney
and myseK obtained what appeared to be satisfactory
evidence forty years ago, and which Prof. Alrutz has in
recent years confirmed.
The immediate work before us is to convince scientific
authorities that various types of supernormal phenomenal
do really exist, and are capable of experimental proof
I do not think that the indifference of official science to
our investigation, which has now replaced their former
hostility, will be affected by an appeal to the emotions,
such as the evidence obtained of survival after death.
Science will approach the supernormal from an entirely
different angle ; it may possibly be pulled over the line of
its present indifference by a growing recognition that
telepathy does really exist. Unfortunately, the difficulty of
finding suitable subjects both for telepathy and telesthesia
is a great drawback. For this reason I am led to the con-
viction that the first movement of thought of official science
in our direction will occur from the impossibility of finding
any normal explanation of the phenomena of dowsing. And
this subject is of all others the simplest and easiest to
investigate. It has not only a wide practical importance,
but it raises no religious opposition, even from the most
timid of narrow-minded people. Moreover, the number of
efficient dowsers can easily be ascertained and experi->
mented with. Having devoted more than twenty years to
the critical investigation of this subject, I believe that ity

affords the easiest and most conclusive evidence that a
supernormal perceptive power—akin to clairvoyance
—
exists in certain persons, of either sex, of all ages and
all degrees of education.
This faculty is to be found not only in various races
of men, but appears to exist, as a new and necessary
sense, in many of the lower types of life. I am con-
vinced that the mysterious migration of birds, even of
very young ones, over vast tracts of land and sea, and
also the homing instincts of many birds and animals,
will be found to be akin to the dowsing faculty in man.^
Difference between Physical and Psychical
Research.
There is, of course, a fundamental difference between
physical research and psychical research. The former deals
with matter and energy, and the condition of the mind of
the observer, whether he be sceptical or not, is of no
consequence. The latter deals with the phenomena of the
subconscious, and the mental attitude both of the experi-
menter and his subject, is of prime importance. An
interesting illustration of the difference between the mental
states in the two cases occurred to me some time ago.
[ happened to be staying in Edinburgh with that famous
physicist. Professor Tait, when the news of the discovery of
:he telephone came to us by cable. I asked Tait what he
thought of it. He replied, " It is all humbug, for such a
iiscovery is physically impossible." When I asked him
low it was that well-known men had asserted that they
lad heard speech transmitted a couple of miles through a
^e, Tait replied it was " probably a case of the con-
iuction of sound by long straight wires." A little later,
;vhen the telephone was shown at the British Association
jy Sir W. Thomson (afterwards Lord Kelvin) and experi-
nents with it were successfully made, Tait's obstinate
ncredulity did not interfere with the success of the
!xperiment. A similar instance occurred in Paris when the
1 See Chapter Two of my little book Creative Thought, published by
Vatkins, CecU Court, London, W.C.
292 Sir William Barrett [part
I
if,

A
ID (
Abbe Moigno, a well-known scientific writer, first showed
Edison's phonograph to the Paris Academy of Sciences ; the
Abbe himself related to me what occurred. All the
savants present declared, as Professor Tait did, that the
reproduction of the human voice by an hon disc was
physically impossible owing to the subtle wave forms pro-
duced by speech, though they admitted music might be so
transmitted. The Abbe was even accused of having a
ventriloquist concealed beneath the table. He left the
chamber in disgust and told them to try the instrument
themselves—which they did quite successfully in spite of
their utter incredulity.
How different is the effect that is produced by mental
environment in psychical phenomena is well known. Those
experienced observers, Stainton Moses and C. C. Massey,
have said, " the most unfavourable disposition to take to
a medium is suspicion, and the most favourable is con-
fidence." Sceptics may think that this is to deliver one-
self over as a prey to the deceiver, and some men do
certainly get taken in, but experience after a time leads
them to discover their mistake. In the psychical world
"faith," as Mr. Massey says, "is a condition of obtaining
evidence, the key to the gate of the invisible world." By
faith Massey means that a sympathetic state of mind
establishes a rapport between the observer and the medium.
The fact that we need no sympathy with our instruments,
when testing a physical or chemical discovery, naturally
leads the physicist or chemist to a state of scornful
amusement, when told that his owir attitude of mind is of
importance in psychical research. But it appears to be a
fact that even if at the back of our minds we entertain
feelings of prejudice and hostility, we can hope for little
success in psychic enquiry, however much we may disclaim
the feeling of hostility. This, of course, does not mean an
attitude of creduhty or any relaxation of careful and
critical observation.
All psychical researchers need to bear in mind that
every sensitive or medium is a suggestible subject ;
if you go
expecting fraud you may possibly create the very fraud
you suspect. If you make preparations beforehand to lay^l^
ICI
rail
xcn.] Reminiscences of Fifty Years 293
a trap for the medium, it is probable that both medium
and experimenter will fall into the trap.
There is another aspect of our enquiry, known to most
of us —^that is, that psychical phenomena largely depend
upon involuntary and not voluntary effort, upon the sub-
conscious and not the conscious self. Even in the simple
phenomena of telepathy it is the subliminal self that is
operative. Further, I believe that the common practice of
experimenters energetically ivilling the idea to be thought
of, is of no value, and may indeed be detrimental to
success. In the early experiments which Myers, Gurney,
and myseK conducted with the Creery children at Buxton
we found tha,t the best results occurred when no strenuous
efforts were made. In fact, when we made the experi-
ments as amusing as possible, we had the greatest success,
though every precaution was taken to prevent coUusion or
signalling.
Another fact which seems to me brought out very clearly
in our experiments is that psychical phenomena, whether
oi telepathy, clairvoyance, or the higher phenomena of
spiritualism, are manifestations of, or through, the trans-
cendental self of the subject, and are therefore independent
3f the fundamental units of the physical world—matter,
bime, and space. It is true that, in the case of telepathy,
he mental response of the percipient to the idea in the
igent's mind, naturally suggests the physical analogue of
:he resonance of a silent tuning-fork to a sounding one
ivhich is in perfect unison with it. Indeed, I was inclined
it first to think that telepathy was somewhat similar to
:his—that it was a nervous induction across space, analogous
o the weU-kno^TL facts of electric and magnetic induction.
But whilst telepathy has been made more conceivable, and
nore credible to the pubHc generally, by the discovery and
ise of wireless telephony, we must remember that the two
phenomena are wholly different. One belongs to the
physical order, the other to the psychical order. The laws
'egulating the transmission of energy across space apply to
ihe one, but not to the other. Immense effort is neces-
lary to transmit a wireless message across the Atlantic,
)ut apparently no effort at all is required to transmit a
ileri

telepathic impact, of which we have instances, from New
Zealand to London. On the contrary, a passive condition
of both transmitter and receiver in telepathy seems
essential, so far at least as thek consciousness is con-
cerned.
The word '
thought-transference ' is apt to be mis-
leading, as it seems to suggest a transmission of ideas
between two persons across material space ;
but, as I said,
space does not seem to enter into the question at all.
Here it may be interesting to note that in the first
publication of the discovery of this super-sensuous faculty,
I called it not '
thought-transference,' but the transfusion
of thought.'^ We are now coming back to this idea, for
telepathy is probably the intermingling of our trans-
cendental selves or souls. The common and grossly
materialistic conception of the soul is that it is limited to
the confines and contour of the body. This is surely an
erroneous conception if, as we believe, the soul is an
immaterial entity, not simply a function of the brain. For
all we know to the contrary, the human soul may spread
through a vast orbit around the body, and may inter-
mingle with other incarnate or discarnate souls. Tennyson
speaks of a di'eam condition, " when the mortal limit of
the seK was loosed, and past into the Nameless, as the
cloud melts into Heaven." Moreover the intimacy and
immediacy of the union between the soul and God is the
fundamental idea, not only of the New Testament, but of
all great Christian thinkers.
CONCLTJSION.
As evidence of the great value which some eminent men
attached to our investigations at their very outset, I will
only quote from a couple of letters which I received more
than forty years ago. That distinguished scientific man of »
the last generation. Dr. Angus Smith, F.R.S., writing to'^
me in 1876, on the theoretic importance of thought-trans-
ference, remarked that " the indications now obtained point

to some mighty truth more decidedly than even the
aberrations of Uranus to the newest of the great planets.
If we could prove the action of mind at a distance by
constant experiments it would be a discovery that would
.make all other discoveries seem trifles." This was also the
s^iew of that eminent biologist, Mr. G. J. Romanes, F.R.S.,
who, when writing to me on the same subject in 1881,
-emarked " if the alleged phenomena are true I hold it to
)e unquestionable that they would be of more importance
)han any other in the science and philosophy of our
iime."'
Quite recently our former President, Professor W.
iI'Dougall, F.R.S., in his presidential address to the
\.merican S.P.R. speaks of psychical research as the most
lopeful barrier against the oncoming tide of materialism,
nd he remarks that " a civilization which resigns itself
holly to materialism lives upon and consumes its moral
apital and is incapable of renewing it. . . . Unless
sychical research can discover facts incompatible with
laterialism, materialism will continue to spread ; no other
ower can stop it, both revealed religion and metaphysical
hilosophy are equally helpless before the advancing tide."
.s regards religion being helpless, I cannot, however, go
3 far as M'Dougall.
Richet's point of view, which is purely materialistic,
3pears at first to contradict M'Dougall's remarks. We
low that Richet, with splendid courage and loyalty to
uth, has avowed his belief in the most incredible psychical
lenomena, some of which even we may perhaps hesitate
I
accept. But Richet's philosophy compels him to reject
le spiritualistic hypothesis and to explain everything by
'
modified psychic force theory ; a theory which was once
cepted by Crookes but subsequently rejected by him.
ichet attributes all the subjective phenomena of psychical
search to '
cryptesthesia,' and some of the objective to
•ragmatic cryptesthesia.' i

" One is reminded by this formidable
nomenclature of the numerous and recondite hypotheses by
which Ptolemaic astronomers tried to make their observa-

To the plain man it seems simpler, less improbable and
more in accordance with facts, for biologists to recognise
—what astronomers long since have done—that the universe
after all is not explicable from the restricted view-point
either of the earth or of the brain. Nevertheless, Richet's
views will doubtless form the half-way house of manj
savants who hold mechanistic theories of the universe
However, I venture to predict that neither they noi y
Richet will remain many years in that convenient bui
anomalous resting-place.
Sooner or later psychical research will demonstrate t(
the educated world, not only the existence of a soul ii
man, but also the existence of a soul in Nature. Ou:
biologists have hitherto been so largely wedded t(
materialistic views that they have overlooked the vas
importance of the psychic factor in evolution. The recog
nition of such a purposive and a pervasive factor, running
throughout the whole realm of nature, will be founc
necessary to invoke in order to explain many biologica
phenomena that now receive very inadequate solutioi
from current theories. Long ago Lord Kelvin said, " Over
poweringly strong proofs exist of intelhgence and benevo

At the present day, when the very foundations of religio:
appear to be shaken, and men are deserting the faith c

opinion on this subject is weU known and often quoted;
and Frederic Myers, as we know, has eloquently expressed
his views. In his Human Persoyiality again and again he

SOME FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF THE MODU^
OPERANDI IN MEDIUMISTIC TRANCE.
By Una, Lady Troubridge.

A,

in
Having read with great interest Doctor Sydney Alrutz'i
comments on my paper " The Modus Operandi in the so
called Mediumistic Trance {Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXII.
p. 344), I feel that in view of the fact that that paper wa
written some years ago, and that I have since then sa^
very constantly with Mrs. Leonard, it may be of interest
not only to Doctor Alrutz but to other members of th
Society if, in addition to answering to the best of m;
ability the questions which Doctor Ahutz asks me,
mention some further characteristics of Mrs. Leonard
trance which I have observed, especially durmg so-calle(
Personal Control. These might tend to confirm or modif;;
some of the tentative conclusions advanced by DoctO:
Ahutz.
I will begin by deahng with the actual questions whicllcli
he asks me in his Paper {Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXIV, leir
pp. 166-180), and by answering them so far as I am able ad
The first question he addresses to me is in Note 1
page 175, when referring to the hjrpersesthesia of th i
fingers observed when Mrs. Leonard is under '
Persona
Control.' Doctor Alrutz asks :
" Who complains of th
hyperaesthesia of the fingers as being 'actually distressful'?
The complaint has been made repeatedly by the persona
control known as A.V.B., and has been insisted upon i
various ways ;
notably by asking that the sitters wi.
refrain from wearing tweed clothes with a rough surface
The trance personaHty A.V.B., i.e. the medium whe:
controlled by A.V.B., who usually supports herself upo:
the sitter's shoulder, complained that the irregularities i;
such material felt to her fingers like great knots and pits
IK
It
299
sen.] Modus Operaridi in Mediumistic Trance
ind that the loose hairs of the stuff felt hke prickly
3ristles. She said that contact with such garments was
^ery unpleasant.
I have not known any other control make the same
omplamt, although other sitters may have met with this
)henomenon during personal controls which I have not
witnessed. It would be interesting to know whether this
las been the case.
Dr. Ah-utz's next question is of a less simple nature and
1 considering my reply to it, it must be borne in mind
hat I am for the moment treating the trance-utterances
t then- face value; acceptmg the trance 'drama' for
'hat It purports to be. Doctor Ah-utz asks on page 176
there is not ''Some evidence of Feda's knowing the
iaontents of the minds of the personal controls from the
-••ircumstance that Feda, at least on the face of it trans-
'Ms the thoughts of the personal controls, for instance
A.V.B. ?
"
My answer is that there is no evidence of Feda's know-
.g anythmg of the contents of the minds of the Personal
antrols or of entities purporting to communicate through
3r agency, beyond that which they elect to tell her or
tow her or in some other way deliberately communicate
:
her either during her control of the medium, or at
ich times as she claims to have 'been with them' m
eir post mortem surroundmgs. There is on the other
It md very strong evidence, on the face of it, that Feda
quite unable, at any time, to tap the mind of a '
com-
i unicator '
at will.
J
As I have said before, A.V.B. will very often, during
irsonal Control, initiate a new topic by stating that she
'i-s purposely not mentioned it "through Feda," as she
i not wish Feda to know anything about it.
'
Or that
e would not risk Feda " begimnng to think about it

5re emerges the fact that I do not think that in eight

300 Una, Lady Troubridge [part
slightest knowledge of any matter which the A.V.B.
Control has claimed to keep from her, and I cannot help
thinking that some slip would have occurred before now
if the claim of the A.V.B. Control to occupy a water
tight compartment were purely fictitious.
Another thing that tends to support this claim has
been of increasingly frequent occurrence during recent
years. As the A.V.B. Control has developed it has tended
to usurp more and more of the sitting, and indeed foi
some time past the Feda Control has seldom been allowec
more than a fleeting appearance of a few minutes duratior
before making reluctant, venj reluctant way indeed, for th(
usurper A.V.B. The manner of Feda's routing is usually
as follows :
—
Having said " Good morning," and made a few u-relevam
remarks, Feda tries to gain time by seeking to obtair
from A.V.B. some really evidential matter. Occasionalb
A.V.B. will apparently humour her, and she will be sue
cessful. She will then retain the Control sometimes unti
the topic initiated is exhausted, and some point of valujid
made clear. But sooner or later, generally sooner, sh *
will hesitate, repeat herself, pause, and exhibit futil
efforts to "get more" from the communicator. The] i«e
will begin the routine complaints : "She wants to com t
herself—she won't tell Feda any more—she's not evei
^
looking at Feda—she's making it impossible for Feda t
get anything ! . .
." Appeals to A.V.B. as Communicator
"Ladye, tvonH you tell Feda some more ?—Wouldn't yo ij
like to give a name for Feda to tell them? ..." FolLV
lowed by: "It's no use, Mrs. Una, she's just shutting heom
mouth tight and looking at somethmg else ! Feda'll hav fa;
to go, and Feda did want to talk more!" Occasionally lis
in desperation, Feda will seek to evoke some other con ta
municator. Then it will be: "Ladye, couldn't you brinice
Mrs. Twonnie's father?" Or she will even attempt iife
relevant conversation with the sitters :—The medium's ne-ies
hat, the sitter's new dress, a present a sitter has promise ppl
Feda—anything will do in order to retain control a litt.'a'
longer, but information from communicators obtaineji
against their will, at any time, Feda, as far as our e2

Bl xcn.] Modus Operandi in Mediumistic Trance . 301
B perience goes, cannot get ; and she is too honest to pre-
1[
tend that she can do so.
)i Doctor Akutz then asks another very important ques-
'i tion. He wishes to know, on page 176 : "Is there any
evidence that the thoughts of a certain Personal Control,
a: say of A.V.B., which Feda transmits, and the utterances
Dof A.V.B. as a Personal Control, really belong to each
9 other or to a common personal source ?
" And Doctor
s Alrutz adds : "If there is such evidence would not this
9 then show that Feda at times really does get at the
01 (tninds of what we call the Personal Controls 1
"
til Now the meaning of the above paragraph in Doctor
U ,A.hutz's paper is not quite clear to me, as it appears to
aae that it might be interpreted in two ways.
ID Does Doctor Ah-utz, when he speaks of Feda "at times
"
li getting at the minds of "What we call Personal Controls
"
E nean that she does so when they are (supposedly) con-
;it <roUing the medium, or is he for the moment referring to
it ihe discarnate entities from whom both '
Feda material
'
111 ind '
Personal Control material ' purport to emanate ?
i As I have already said, if Doctor Ah-utz is basing any
til uppositions upon the assumption that Feda has optional
le iccess as eavesdropper to any Personal Control utterances,
Di >r can tap the thoughts of an unwilling '
communicator,'
?e hen in my opinion all the evidence is against such being
t he case. But if his question suggests that evidence of
a jimilarity of character between A.V.B. utterances retailed
;[
ly Feda, and Personal Control utterances of the same
^0 L.V.B., would be evidence that both had a common
\ ource in her surviving entity to whose thoughts Feda
ail^as occasionally permitted access for purposes of trans-
11
{lission ;
then my answer is that such evidence of one
m haracter or personality running right tlxrough the utter-
ii nces abounds. It is one of the chief grounds upon
i ^hich one could base a supposition that a common source
le es behind the entire A.V.B. phenomena. The same
ii( pphes to a number of other '
Personalities '
manifesting
tt uring Mrs. Leonard's trance, partially through the Feda
Bl ?ency and partially as '
Personal Controls.'
e To discuss at any length the nature of this '

source ' was, as I stated, distinctly outside the scope oi
my former paper, and is and probably will remain prema
ture, so long as the 'modus operaridi' of the trances undei
consideration is almost completely unknown to us. Bui
it may possibly be of some interest to say a few words
as to what sources are definitely insufficient in themselves u
as wholly accounting for the entire manifestations of th(
'
Leonard A.V.B. Personality '
as known to Miss Radclyffe^ id
Hall and myself after eight years of constant sittings
with Mrs. Leonard.
As was stated in our joint-paper on Mrs. Leonard'^ tl
phenomena {Proc. S.PM., Vol. XXX., p. 339 ff.), both Mis!|»|
Eadclyffe-Hall and I were intimately acquainted witl
A.V.B. for many years, up to the actual time of he:
death, which took place fifteen months before either of ui
ever saw or sat with Mrs. Leonard. We have in tha
paper given a full accoiuit of our early investigations witl
that medium, and gone at length into our reasons fo
beUeving that no normal knowledge on her part of thi
living A.V.B. existed, that would account for even th
simpler early manifestations.
This belief has been consistently strengthened throughoufcn
the intervening years. Not only by the corroboration
afforded by Mrs. Leonard's untarnished career of integrity
and by the results of the investigation of her phenomen
by the Society for Psychical Research. But by the fac i
that no humanly conceivable system of enquiry, observa
tion, deduction, or of all three put together, could, in ov
opinion, sufiice for the production of the great mass c
verifiable utterances regarding matters known to A.V.I
during her lifetime, of facts and incidents regarding oui
selves and others that were also known to her, of coi
temporary events and actions affecting us mentione
during the trances, and above all of a salient and intense]
characteristic personality of which the point of view, senf
of humour, judgment, prejudices and partialities, tl
actual voice and laugh, in fine all those traits and pecul M
arities which go to make what we call '
Personahty ' a;
so constantly characteristic of the living A.V.B. as \
knew her that they could not fail to be equalfcsi

ecognised as such by anyone who had really known
jia-l.er.
It may be objected that since we ourselves knew her
o well it is unnecessary to seek beyond our minds for the
Durce of the phenomena, assuming that Mxs. Leonard
ossesses when in trance an extensive and almost infal-
ible access to the mind of anyone present. Undoubtedly
luch of what is uttered by the Feda and Personal Con-
ols might be obtained in this way, provided that we
re justified in assuming an extent of telepathic faculty so
,r hardly supported, in my opinion, by results obtained in
i& nought-transference experiments between hving persons,
ritliy stretching our creduhty very far beyond our knowledge
perhaps quite as far as would be necessary for the ac-
Dptance of the spirit hypothesis ?) we can assume that
nee we have m past years heard and known A.V.B.'s
rati pice and laugh, and have intimately known her character,
since that knowledge must remain sub-consciously in
together with an instinctive knowledge of what would
'
3 her comments on and reactions to certain situations or
imuH, all such useful content of our minds can be drawn
oon by the entranced Mrs. Leonard, and selected, sifted
itioiid dramatised for her purposes.
jiU But I am bound to say that in absence of all proof of
Mich possibility, this theory makes my own personal
faceduhty feel rather like Alice in Wonderland's neck after
era, .6 had sampled one side of the toadstool.
1 01 1
That a fitful and intermittent telepathy between medium
(
lid sitter does operate and account for some of the
V.liienomena produced I am practically convinced, and
on deed the fact is admitted by both the Feda and A.V.B.
(Oiimtrols ; but I cannot bring myself to the belief that it
inaei as extensive as is sometimes suggested by those who
iisele determined on explaining everything without recourse
;eni
the spiritistic hypothesis. Even were I to admit it as
tl explanation of all that occurs during the trance which
,e(iil
lid by this means be obtained from the mind of someone
ai
3sent, this admission would not dispose of the entire
; V.B. phenomena or account for all the evidence of
pal rsonality and Identity.
304 Una, Lady Troubridge [pai
We should still be compelled to seek a source for tl
residuum, and that source is not the medium's OM^n norm
knowledge, judgment or personality.
It cannot be too strongly emphasised that Mrs. Leonard
normal self and character do not in any way suggest *
resemble those of A.V.B. j
Mrs. Leonard is not without a marked character ar
personality, her opinions are definite as are her approva
and disapprovals, and no one knowing her at all w(
could call her colourless.
A.V.B. was also a very definite personality, and
many ways unusual and characteristic.
Had A.V.B. and Mrs. Leonard met in the flesh th(
would have liked and respected each other, I do not doul
but I equally do not doubt that had any intimate knoA
ledge of each other been possible they would have differe
on many matters great and small, reacted very different
to identical stimuli, and maintained contrary opinions wii
equal determination. I
Therefore I declare that the source of the Leonari
A.V.B. Personality as such is not to be found in a mere
coincidental resemblance to that of Mrs. Leonard, ev(
when we are dealing with matter which necessitates i
supernormal knowledge of events or facts.
Consideration must also be given to utterances both l
the Feda A.V.B. and the A.V.B. Personal Control
subsequently verified facts unknown at the time of utte
ance not only to the normal Mrs. Leonard but also
•
anyone present at the sitting.
It is true that such utterances are not of frequent occu
rence ; but they do occur, and cannot be ignored.
Coincidence has been invoked and done to death in th
connection, but anyone who has studied the utterances f(
as long as we have, or anyone for that matter who w:
study in the Proceedings of the Society Mrs. Henry Sid]
wick's Paper on Leonard Book Tests {Proc. S.P.R., Vc
XXXI., p. 242 ff.) and a later paper on Experimental Boc
Tests tabulated by Colonel Baddeley {Proc. S.P.R., Vc
XXXIII., p. 606 f¥.), and will consider the relative averag(
of success obtained, will not long remain contented wil
xcii.] Modus Operandi in Mediumistic Trance 305
the coincidence hypothesis as an adequate explanation of
everything that occurs in the Leonard trances which is
unexplainable as emanating from either Mrs. Leonard's
normal knowledge or from that of anyone present at the
time of utterance.
I am not proposing to offer any explanation, I am
merely stating observed facts, and I will add that on a
number of occasions the trance-utterances have referred
correctly to recent or almost contemporaneous actions by
persons some distance away. I am unfortunately unable
to include here any actual examples or extracts from
records of sittings, as I am away from home and have
not access to any papers or books of reference. I am
therefore confined to dealing with the matter in a general
way, which, however, I must ask my readers to believe,
does not flatter the phenomena under discussion.
In conclusion, I should like to record here some addi-
tional observations of the peculiarities of the trance which
have struck Miss Radclyffe-Hall and myself since my last
paper was written. Since then the A.V.B. Personal Con-
trol has manifested frequently and regularly. It has much
developed and strengthened, and some of my earlier com-
ments must be modified, some reversed.
The voice of the A.V.B. Personal Control is now quite
as strong as Feda's, at any rate during the greater part
of the Control, which has gradually usurped nearly the
entire sitting. Feda, as stated above, seldom appears at
our sittings in these days save as a very brief introduction
to the A.V.B. Control, and I think that but for our
insistence she might well have been dispensed with alto-
gether for more than a year past. When, however, her
control began to shrink to its present proportions, we
made a definite request both to Feda herself and to the
A.V.B. Control that Feda should always put in a pre-
liminary appearance, however brief. We felt that any
alteration of the customary procedure might increase the
strain on the medium's system, and initiate that deteriora-
tion in her phenomena which we have observed in other
mediums who admit of frequent, extended and various
Personal Controls, especially without introduction by an
30G Una, Lady Troubridge [part
habitual Control. Moreover, Feda, as stated above, is
always anxious to appear and reluctant to go, retiring
only when the A.V.B. Control, to all appearance, renders j
her presence impossible. The A.V.B. Personal Control \
now therefore manifests practically throughout the entire i
sitting, but the sittings are seldom of more than one hour's
to one and a half hour's duration, the Control collapsing,
usually quite abruptly, within that time, and giving evi-
dence of having '
held out ' to the very last gasp. There-
fore it cannot be said that even yet the A.V.B. Control
possesses the field with quite the same facihty as Feda,
who has been known to chatter volubly for nearly three
hours on end !
I stated formerly that the percentage of evidential
matter given by the A.V.B. Personal Control was much
inferior to that obtained through the Feda Control, and
this I think is no longer the case. In these days
the A.V.B. Control certainly equals Feda in the ease
with which evidential matter is volunteered and evi- !
dential topics initiated, and the manner of giving these !
by the A.V.B. Personal Control being much more
direct than are Feda's methods, more ground is often i
covered in less time. Feda still retains, either by choice
or of necessity, her childish phraseology, and her habit of '
elaborately describing an object which one would think t
must be as familiar to her as to the sitter. As it is i
invariably quicker to call a book a book than to describe «
it in the '
Feda manner '
as " A square thing—no, not
quite square, oblong—and fiat, or nearly fiat—and Feda if
thinks it's got a hard outside of some shiny stuff—wait it
a minute, cloth ? —And paper, yes—paper inside with print- j
s
ing on it—etc., etc., etc.," the A.V.B. Personal Control, in tf
the course of an hour's work will easily outstrip a two 6
hours' Feda Control in the number of evidential points st
volunteered.
On the other hand, Feda holds the palm when it comes
to answering a direct question put by the sitter. During »
our early experiences with Mrs. Leonard, a definite question, «
even when put to Feda, required a world of tact and judg-
ment on the part of the sitter. The selection of the ft)
xcn.] Modus Operandi in Mediumistic Trance 307
opportune moment, the manner of phrasing the enquiry,
the easy nonchalant tone of voice, the assurance that a
reply was really immaterial, all these were necessary to
obviate an immediate self-consciousness on Feda's part
which would jeopardise not only the required answer but
the whole e^ddential current of the sitting. In these days
this difficulty is almost non-existent where Feda is
concerned. A direct question, simply asked, will often
< ehcit an equally dii-ect answer or a suitable description.
At other times Feda will frankly express inability to reply,
or will promise, and in that case generally give, a later
answer. All this exactly as one would do oneself in the
i course of an ordinary conversation. But this particular
!
increase of faciUty does not apply equally to the A.V.B.
Personal Control. A direct question will more often than
not strike her literally dumb, she is seldom able to give
an immediate and direct answer, and indeed the injudi-
cious asking of such a question will often cause some
minutes of complete silence, and will only serve to break
the thread of the voluntary matter being given. This is
however not invariably the case, and A.V.B. is decidedly
jj
improving ; in fact only recently a question as to the
1|
nature of a new pet that we had acquired was triumph-
antly answered by A.V.B., who immediately wrote the
j
word '
Parrot '
in printed letters on the back of my hand,
'
naming each letter as she wrote it. She added, quite
correctly, that it was an unusual bird in its markings,
:
that it was more restless than any parrot she had ever
seen, constantly moving to and fro sideways, and that
j
it appeared to slip upon its perch, of which it did not
seem able to get a proper grip. However, in this matter
of answering direct questions, the A.V.B. Personal Control
is still very far behind Feda, and such a call upon her
self-possession is not usually successful.
Another point mentioned in my paper, and to which
Doctor Alrutz refers, is the long exhalation of breath which
so often heralds the arrival, so to speak, of a personal
control.
Since the further development of the A.V.B. Personal
Control another curious feature connected with the me-
308 Una, Lady Trouhridge [paet
dium's breathing has been observed on several occasions.
Some months ago the A.V.B. Personal Control expressed
a desire to learn to sit upright in her chair, instead of, as
heretofore, lolling forward on the sitter's shoulder. This
upright position did not appear materially to affect the
manifestations of the control, she spoke audibly, coherently
and evidentially as usual. But on several occasions the
medium became scarlet in the face, a series of gasps was
followed by moments of apparent asphyxia, and finally the
A.V.B. Personal Control fell forward into the sitter's arms
breathing heavily and proffering the explanation that she
had nearly choked the medium because she had " for-
gotten to breathe " !
The hypersesthesia of hearing also mentioned in my
paper as affecting Mrs. Leonard just before a sitting, or,
as Doctor Alrutz puts it, "When hypnosis is coming on,"
does not, as Doctor Alrutz surmises, depart with the
coming of the deep trance condition and the emergence of
Feda, or even with that of the A.V.B. Personal Control.
There have been signs of it quite often when the Feda
Control is in full swing. Not only is Feda easily put oft
and annoyed by trifling noises—I have heard her break off
from a subject in hand in order to compare the muffled
sound of a lift to the roaring of a lion—but, amid her
own noisy chatter, she will notice and draw the sitter's
attention to a tiny distant sound like a church bell or an
aeroplane, even though the sound in question be so faint
as to be almost inaudible to the sitters listening atten-
tively in the hushed seance room. As for the A.V.B.
Personal Control, on a quite recent occasion when she was
resting on my shoulder, she complained that I was champ-
ing my teeth, and that the sound I made appeared to
her like the firing of cannons !
I do not know whether what I have written here con-
cerning the Leonard-Feda-A.V.B. Phenomena will bring
forth any further interesting comments from Doctor
Alrutz. I hope it may, but in any event I am most
grateful to him for making me realise that I had
a duty too long delayed. Having put forward in my
earlier paper, for the benefit of those interested, certain
xcn.] Modus Operandi in Mediumistic Trance 309
aspects of Mrs. Leonard's trance and some tentative hypo-
theses based upon my experience up to the time of
wTiting, and having urged others to probe more deeply
into the subject, it is only right that I should give equal
publicity to further experiences and observations which
have led me to reconsider and modify some of my sup-
positions and suggestions, and which may influence others
to do likewise.
And—a big AND—I honestly do 7iot beheve that if
Doctor Ahrutz, having induced a deep hypnosis in a
subject, were able to restore to that subject the " Vocal
organs, peripheral and central, and then by the help of
telepathy make these restored parts of [the subject's]
organism talk and give utterance to [his] thoughts," he
would have achieved a process that could be compared,
in any conclusive manner, with what takes place when
the Leonard organism gives, via the Feda Control or the
A.V.B. Personal Control, a really evidential sitting.
If Doctor Akutz were able to attempt such an experi-
ment with IVIrs. Leonard (and I feel sure he agrees with
me as to the inadvisabihty of subjecting a valuable
medium to experiments of which it is impossible to foresee
the consequences) he might obtain very interesting results.
But I should not even then be prepared to decide upon
the source thereof. We should still have to consider the
rival claims of : 1. Dr. Akutz. 2. ]\Irs. Leonard herself.
3. The Feda Control. 4. The A.V.B. Personal Control.
And last but not least, of the Unknown Quantity.

farious in scope, and of very different intrinsic value. Along
with papers of historical interest there were things little better
than domestic memoranda, such as a list of things packed for
a voyage, or a list of purchases made before coming home, or
memoranda of the fees obtained for professional services, or
correspondence about what sort of fee it would be reasonable
to charge : any number of letters also, many of no particular
interest, such as acceptances of invitations, or applications for
tickets for ceremonials,—in fact, a good deal of what might
legitimately be stigmatised as "' rubbish." Beside all this,
however, there were letters and controversies about the dis-
covery of thallium, attempts to deal with the cattle plague,
correspondence and controversy about the radiometer,
speculations and predictions about wireless telegraphy, and
dealings with diamond, gold, and radium ; some of these being
of considerable, some of small, interest. And it must have
been very difficult to decide what to include.
One result, perhaps an unfortunate result, of the biographer's
decision to include a large number of trivial documents is that
methods of abstracting gold, in one form or another, loom
rather large throughout the volume, and are continually occur-
ring ; sometimes in the domain of chemistry, sometimes ap-
proaching the realm of high finance, but rather frequently in
xcn.] The Life of CrooJces 311
the petty details of business economy and comiiany specula-
tions. The biographer's aim no doubt is to produce a com-
posite portrait, and not to slur over anything that throws
light upon the character of his subject ; but it may be held
that the result is rather unfortunate. Trivial things occur in
the lives of all men, but they are usually taken for granted,
not emphasised or given a j^ermanent position in biography
;
so that when they are emphasised, or even recorded, these
details loom larger than they ought, and rather spoil the
balance ; not because they are anything more than common-
place, but just because they are commonplace.
What had to be brought out was that Crookes, by his own
exertions, did achieve a sufficient fortune to enable him to
devote the main part of his life to science. Details of the
fees which he received in consultation or in legal procedure,
j
after he had established his reputation, are utterly unimportant
and should be out of the picture ;
they distract attention from
the real business of life. Financial matters which lead to
disaster, or which lead on the other hand to increased facility
for work, are bound to be included ; but unnecessary details
about minor things of that sort are abhorrent.
The main outlines of what one would look for in the bio-
I
graphy of a man of science, after dates and parentage or
i
ancestry and educational opportunities, are such as these :—
the circumstances which led him to take up science as a pro-
fession or a hobby, some account of his early struggles and
gaining of recognition, and then a vivid representation, with
contemporary documents, illustrating the main work of his life.
For the carrying out of such a task in the case of William
Crookes Dr. Fournier d'Albe seemed eminently suitable ; for he
had graduated, so to speak, either literally or metaphorically,
in both physics and psychics, and was sufficiently acquainted
with chemistry to appreciate the work of a great chemist.
But in spite of a brave, and no doubt earnest, effort to over-
|Come the difficulties of the task, the result must be regarded
t
as somewhat disappointing : the outcome stril<es a reader who
knew Crookes and his work as rather less than fair to his
memory. Superlatives are introduced from time to time, no
ioubt ; some more, some less appropriate ; but it can in no
sense be called a panegyric. Possibly the biographer had not
312 iS!ir Oliver Lodge [part
much personal acquaintance with the subject of his memoir
in his study and laboratory. Undoubtedly it must be very
difficult to form an estimate of a man from a miscellaneous
array of letters and documents. From that point of view, the
wonder is that it has been done so well.
This reviewer's own personal estimate of Crookes is suffi-
ciently indicated in the introduction which he wrote for Dr.
Fournier's book ; and it is unnecessary to add to that. He
would only like to testify of his own knowledge, what the
book perhaps sufficiently indicates, that the mutual devotion
of Crookes and his wife can hardly be exaggerated ;
that they
lived to celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of their union ;
and
that when she died he was inconsolable until he obtamed
what he considered proof of her continued companionship. Ijs

Some remarks must now be made concerning a few of the
chemico-physical and psychic details recorded in this volume.
On the whole Crookes was more of a chemist than a physicist.
His traming had been that of a chemist ; and although he
made important discoveries in physics, he generally stated
them in such a way as to arouse opposition and controversy.
Controversy indeed ruled throughout his life, sometimes taking
a painful form. One of the most painful controversies must have
been that at the Royal Institution with Sir James Dewar. It is
mentioned in this review only to bring forward a privately known
proof of Crookes's magnanimity : for when, soon afterwards, it
was proposed at the Royal Society that its highest honour, the
Copley Medal, should be given to Dewar, Crookes, a previous
recipient of that medal, came out of his comparative retkement
and earnestly supported the proposition ;
which, needless to i
say, was carried.
The chief discoveries associated with Crookes's name are the
new element ThaUium,—discovered spectroscopically and ex- iti
hibited at the 1862 Exhibition, though even about that ill
there was much vexatious controversy ; the radiometer,— la
again with much disagreement about its mode of action ;
the
spinthariscope,—a useful and convenient and, as it turns out, II
important outcome of experiments on radium ;
and, chief ofId
all, radiant matter or cathode rays or "matter in a fourth
state,"—the foundation of a whole new branch of physics, and
irt
XCII.] The Life, of Crookes 313
the early beginning of the later discovery by others of the
j
electron. It will probably be held by posterity that the
;
electrical work in high vacua, part of which was summarised
and demonstrated in his discourse to the British Association
at Sheliield on August 22nd, 1879, marks the climax of Crookes's
. lUfe and achievement.
I
The discourse itself was rather brilliant, and passages from
it are quoted in this volume, but the experiments in high
vacua, by which it was illustrated, were far more brilliant ;
1 and it is difficult to over-estimate their great and epoch-
f I
making importance. From a sort of toy, exhibited at scientific
i soirees, the vacuum-tube rose to a position of extraordiaary
i dignity and usefulness, and may be said to dominate the
physics of the latter portion of the nineteenth and the early
part of the twentieth century.
Members of the S.P.R. will be able to form a good estimate
?f the main outlines of Crookes's work by reading the obituary
lotice by a contemporary man of science. Sir William Barrett,

So far, we have said not a word about that paiixful and
mpopular episode or period in Crookes's life wherein he took
ull advantage of exceptional opportunities olfered him for the
xamination of supernormal phenomena, diiring the years 1871
o 1874, a period of great importance to the disciples of
)sycbic science, and one in connexion with which they will
Iwaj^s hold Crookes and his pioneering work in high honour
nd remembrance. But, as often happens to investigators
ato unpopular novelties, the work brought upon himself, as
a,r as the public were concerned, only ridicule, painful
ontroversy, and condemnation. He entered upon the subject
ath a light heart, he left it \vith a heavy one. He
nagined that by careful experimenting, and by frankness,
e would disarm hostility and convince the scientific world,
thers have been under a similar impression, both before
nd since ! We now know, or at least the writer does, that
rookes observed many things which, however incredible, were
:ue ; and that, by aid of the unusual powers of D. D. Home
X
314 Sir Oliver Lodge [pabt
and Florence Cook, he had opportunities for investigation denied
to most of us. But the citadel of orthodoxy was too strong ;
Crookes failed to storm it ; it is intact to this day, though
breaches have been made in its wall, or at any rate some o[
the garrison have deserted. But for the rest of his life
though he would willingly speak privately on the subject, and
though his convictions were quite unaltered,—he no longer
thought it necessary to incur the odium and the numerous
disabilities incurred by pressing the subject on his scientific
confreres. So, after a vigorous and stormy few years, he went
on with M-hat he considered his scientific work proper, and
therein achieved so much that, in spite of the hostility he had
aroused, scientific honours and medals flowed upon him ;
and
ultimately he was even elected, though not without some
searchings of heart, to the Presidency of the Royal Society.
Undoubtedly the researches of Crookes into psycho-physical
phenomena must have been among the material which was in
the minds of the founders of the S.P.R., when in the late
seventies and early eighties, Sir William Barrett (the only
remaining livmg founder) discussed with Henry Sidgwick.
Frederic Myers, and Edmund Gurney, together with Alfred
Russel Wallace and probably some others, the prospects of a
society which might be founded to take up that large and
neglected field of investigation to the very existence of which
the long established scientific societies were blind and deai
when not contemptuous. Fortunately, or so it seems, the
first fruits of the Society, and indeed of Barrett's own work
on the subject, lay in the comparatively innocuous and less
sensational direction of the kind of thought transference to
which Myers gave the name " telepathy." Crookes indeed,
later in life, rather regretted that his good fortune had not led
him to approach the subject from that end. At the same
time the more physical end seemed natural to an experimentei
in chemistry and physics : and he probably had too little
training in psychology and literature to be able to make the
headway which the co-operators who founded the Society did
undoubtedly make. Nevertheless, physical phenomena are among|j|j
those occurrences which had been testified to again and again ;
and they were by no means excluded from the purview of the
^
new Society. Indeed a special committee was initiated from
tien
if.

the first to try to carry on and complete the investigation
begun by the Dialectical Society in the previous decade. And
if opportunity had offered, they would doubtless have been
willing to continue and develop the observations of Crookes.
Even telepathy, however, would not have been acceptable to
the scientific magnates of that day. There are still some to
whom it is not acceptable now. And Barrett encountered
hostility when, in 1876, he tried to read a paper on the subject
before a scientific body, and offered to make demonstration
of the telepathic powers possessed by members of a family
with whom he himself had made careful observations.
The best known of Crookes's experiments, and those which
3aused the most outcry and derision, were the remarkable
ieries of experiments in full blown materiaUsation,—for a
icientific treatment of Avhich the time was evidently not yet
•ipe. The Florence Cook and Katie King episodes are not
ully described in this volume. A fuller extract from the
ecords of the time is given by Dr. Fournier d'Albe himself in his
)ook, published by Longmans in 1908, New Light on Immor-
ality, Chapters 2 and 3 of Part III.,—a book which is well
« rorth referring to ;
though it contains statements by Mrs,
'
loss Church (Florence Marryat) which cannot be credited, and
0 some of which Crookes himself later gave unqualified denial
3ee Proc. 8.P.R., XII., p. 268.)
Crookes was the victim not so much of controversy as of
aeer denunciation ;
his most voluble antagonist being Dr. W. B.
arpenter, one of the learned physiologists of the time, who
|as subsequently Registrar of the University of London,—
a
lan of weight and influence, but, as is now seen, of far less
lan scientific caution and fairmindedness. Another antagonist
as the eminent man of science Sir Charles Wheatstone, to
hose inventions the early progress of telegraphy owed so much,
n the other hand there were one or two who had already
jcome convinced of some of the facts, not only the famous
ologist, A. R. Wallace, but the well-known electricians Crom-
ell, and his brother S. A. Varley ; who indeed encouraged
•cokes to take up the subject, and assisted him in some°of
3 early experiments Avith Home,—making, among others, an
ictrical test which, though not really more conclusive than
316 'Sir Oliver Lodge [part
m
im
ffltf
In
mechanical ones, might appear more conclusive to the public
mind. S. A. Varley was a man for whose contributions to
cable telegraphy Lord Kelvin in later life frequently asserted
that he had not received a due meed of recognition and
approbation. That by the way ; and only as showing, to a
generation which has now nearly forgotten these workers, that
their experimental ability was by no means to be despised.
There were others, of course, not so exactly in the line oi
scientific ancestry, who countenanced these phenomena and were
fully convinced of then- reality. And perhaps it was partlj
due to association with these that Crookes—akeady recognisec
as a discoverer—conceived that when he found himself able tc
add his own first-hand testimony, and utilise the exception
ally favourable opportunities which then prevailed, his wore
would be received and opposition would crumble. Wisely, h(
made selection of what he thought would be palatable material
he did not seek to interest the oificers of the Royal Society-
chief among whom was the world-famous mathematical phy
sicist Sir George Gabriel Stokes—in any of the strange anc
ultra-normal physiological and apparitional phenomena whicl
he had witnessed ; but he did seek to make a demonstratioi
of the powers of Home, reduced to their bare elements, b\
means of a very simple mechanical arrangement for provmg thi ^
existence of an unknown force, which he called " psychii
force." This experiment he begged both Stokes and Wheat
stone to come to see ; but they declined, saying that if thi
arrangements were really as he described them, the thin|
could not possibly work. To this Crookes replied that he di(
not say the thing was possible or likely, but only that i
happened. He succeeded in getting Dr. Huggins, the astrono
mer, to see the apparatus worldng, and also to be presen
while an accordion, held in Home's hand by its dummy em
in a cage, with its keyboard hanging down, moved about an(
sounded its notes. But Sir William Huggins refrained froE
conspicuously championing the phenomenon, and preferred fo
a considerable time to remain anonymous, at least so far a
the public were concerned. He, however, was not one of th
officials of the Royal Society at the time, though subsequentlj
in due time, he became its President. .. -

clearly in Chapter XII. of the book under review,—a long
chapter dealing with this phase in Crookes's life, —and it is
unnecessary to say more about it here ; except regretfully to
say that the author's treatment in a few particulars is not
altogether fair to Crookes's memory, and not such as Crookes
m his lifetim-e would have approved. Certain metrical state-
ments by Crookes are stigmatised as erroneous, while the still
more erroneous statements of objectors are cited without cor-
rection as if they were true. There must have been a certain
amount of carelessness in this part of the book ; and the
Genuineness of the whole affair appears to be left under a
3loud of suspicion which is very far from being justified by the
statements themselves, and which by no means correctly repre-
sents the attitude of Crookes hunself at any part of his life.
In this review, therefore, it seems desirable to call attention
io the particularly simple experiment above mentioned, and
)oint out some of the gratuitous errors which, judging from
-he text, were made at that time by critics of importance.
Jnimportant and anonymous critics did not hesitate to ridicule
he whole thing ; that is only to be expected, and is of no
noment, but what responsible scientific authorities say, at any
)eriod, is historically important, and, if uncorrected, is natur-
% taken as accurate. The foUowuag remarks, therefore, may
erve as a summary and supplement to this part of the book.
Crookes arranged an apparatus of the simplest possible land
a order to verify that an unknown force actually operated,
nd in some sense to record and measure its amount. Tor
his purpose he arranged a horizontal mahogany board three
3et long, 8 1 inches wide, and 1 inch thick ; with one edge
upported on the edge of a table, and the other end sus-
pended by a registering spring- balance, hung from a firm
ripod stand. The medium was seated at the table and his
ands were placed lightly on the fixed or fulcrum end. The
3sult was that after a time the board tilted down, and the
alance at the other end indicated that its spiral spring had
een stretched as if loaded by a weight, sometimes as much
s from 3 to 6 lbs. He also made a registering apparatus,
'ith smoked glass moved by clockwork, so that a trace should
e recorded, indicating by objective and permanent record the
mount of the force at different times. All this was pubhshed
318 Sir Oliver Lodge [paet
in The Quarterly Journal for Science for July 1871, and con-
tinned in October 1871, with confirmatory testimony by Sir
William Huggins and Serjeant Cox. The testimony was later
reiDroduced, with an appendix of correspondence illustrating the
controversial reception the experiment met with, in a book
called Researches in Spiritualism, which appears to be now out
of print.
These experiments are referred to in the volume now under
review, page 218 and thereabouts. To avoid the suspicion
that the medium, when touching the board, might trespass
beyond the fulcrum and be surreptitiously pressing with ex-
ceptional violence, so as to produce a force comparable to a
pound weight or more at the far end of the lever, Crookes
marked the position of Home's fingers on the board, and
subsequently placed on or near the fulcrum a vessel of water,
into which the medium was to dip his fingers without touching
the board at all. And to avoid accidentally or purposely
touching the rim or sides of this vessel, he arranged above
it another water container, a sort of copper bowl, fixed to an
independent support ; the bowl being (unfortunately and
perhaps unnecessarily) perforated at the bottom so that water
in the bowl communicated with the water in the vessel below
and the medium only dipped his fingers into this upper copper
bowl, shown in an illustration on page 220 of the book.
But stiU the spring balance at the far end of the lever, now
untouched except through water, exhibited a force of nearly
a pound.
The most absurd arguments were used agamst these experi
ments. For instance, a writer in the Journal of the Franklin
Institute says that, though Crookes's evidence practically shows
that the board apparently weighed only 6 lbs., it ought, from
its size and from the specific gravity of mahogany, to weigh
13 lbs. ; he therefore indicates a suspicion that the board was
a trick board, supplied by the medium ! To which Crookes,
repHed that the board had been in his possession for years,
that it had already formed part of several previous pieces ol
apparatus, and that, whatever it ought to weigh, it did actually „(
weigh only 6 lbs.
Another objection, more responsibly made by Sir Charles
Wheatstone, was that a water connection was no guarantee [f(

against the exertion of force, since—so he argues—if only
3 cubic inches of water were displaced by the fingers, it would
by hydrostatic laws be equivalent to a pressure of from 12
"to 13 ozs., or nearly a pound. This arithmetical error is
reproduced on p. 219 of The Life of Crookes without correction.
As a matter of fact the weight of three cubic inches of water
is only an ounce and threequarters ! This matter, though
apparently trivial, is historically important because a special effort
" was being made to interest the Royal Society. In its early
days the opportunity for witnessing such an "absurd" ex-
periment would have been welcomed by the Society ; but
now, ui its later dignity and immense loiowledge, it is repelled
by the apparently impossible. Crookes is accused by his
biographer of having, in this crucial instance, made a faux
pas, with serious consequences to Science. It is not really
so :
though m his original description he probably had a
Ij
momentary lapse, and had expressed himself with less than
« imeticulous accuracy. He was not a professor of Physics. When
"
he came to reply to objections, he might have admitted the
hydrostatic argument and at the same time attacked the
erroneous arithmetic ;
but, instead, he contented himself with
a, demonstration that as a matter of fact no appreciable
iefiexion of the lever could normally be caused in that way,
3ven when the bowl was not exactly over the fulcrum.
Brookes expressly states that dipping his whole hand to the
l;
lull extent in the upper bowl of water did not produce the
east appreciable action on the balance at the other end
jf the lever. This is in accordance with common sense.
The whole weight of a man on the fulcrum would not
i^liccoimt for the stretching of the spring. That the weight of
whatever water was displaced would give some extra pressure
m the fulcrum is true enough, but that this effect would be
'3 rery small is obvious from the picture of the apparatus, and
lothing appreciable could normally reach the far end of the
"lever.
Wheatstone's concluding comment, when this was pointed
>ut, was that it appeared to him contrary to all analogy that
-ny force, acting according to physical laws, should produce
he forcible depression of a lever by acting on its fulcrum !
t«
?o which Crookes replied that he entirely agreed ; that that
320 Sir Oliver Lodge [part
was the whole gist of the experiment, and the only reason he
regarded it as worthy of attention. \
The episode illustrates one of the difficulties which is bound
to be encountered by investigators of novel physical phenomena.
If a new kind of force is exerted, the experiments are almost
bound to be surprising and, so to speak, incredible—so in-
credible that responsible leaders in science may be unwilling
to subject themselves to what they regard as the farce of at-
tempted demonstration. As in Galileo's time, they may refuse
to look through the telescope ;
or, if they do, may regard it as
a deceptive instrument. Many Continental investigators, and
some in this country, are now inclined to suppose that the
force in these and other more striking instances of telekinesis
is due to or is associated with the mechanical intervention or
employment of an invisible previously unknown material,
probably emanating from the medium, in the form of what we
now call ectoplasm,—a form of substance which was then not
recognised or perhaps suspected by anyone. Nothing but
direct observation and instrumental confirmation can establish
such things as realities ; and in the absence of theory ex-
periment must always be scrutinised with exceptional severity.
A plausible theory need not jump into existence at the same
time as new facts are observed ; but until there is some guiding
theory or clue the facts seem detached from organised science,
and are rebutted and disbelieved on theoretical grounds. Dis-
belief is only natural, and its foundation in common sense is
rather like a modified version of David Hume's arguments
against miracles, viz. that it is more likely that a witness
should he than that a miracle should happen ; because the one-
is consonant with human experience and the other is not.
That is quite true ; but if the thing really does happen, and
if it can be shown contemporaneously to happen, the
argument has no weight ; the facts, when proven, are them-
selves an expansion of human experience ; and they clearly
establish the need for overhauliiig and enlarging our theoretical jj
h
foundations. Things that are unlikely may nevertheless be
true. Our knowledge of nature is not so extensive that we
are able to say beforehand what is possible and what is not
possible in a novel region of enquiry. That is where even
Faraday—that prince of investigators—made, in an obiter
XCII.] The, Life of Crookes 321
; dictmn, one of his few mistakes. The history of science is too
much disfigured by the premature rejection and contempt with
1 which novelties have often been received. They are accepted,
in the long run, by some subsequent generation ; but the re-
t sponsible generation living at the time does not rise to the
height of its opportunities. Contemporary men of science
I
unfortunately write themselves down, not only as ignorant,
which was inevitable, but as blind and prejudiced and sadly
e bigoted : though it is true that in their lifetime their contemp-
s tuous attitude gains them credit for robust common sense and
1 sanity. They are wise, therefore, in their day and generation,
e It is singular, and perhaps depressing, that the obscurantist
e attitude of theologians in the past had been so amply imitated
It by the pontiffs and high priests of science in the recent present.
I, They still oppose their admirable theories aiid great knowledge
e of the universe to resist the incursion of fresh information ;
it they oppose observed facts on a priori and utterly inadequate
it grounds. No one ought to consider his knowledge of the
i universe so complete and final as to be competent to negative
i- careful testimony based on critical and responsible experiment
r. and observation, especially if the observer has already proved
le his competence in more recognised branches of knowledge,
ij Explanatory hypotheses may be criticised severely, but the
e, facts demand attention.
s- In the light of our present or subsequent knowledge, his-
torical rejections of truth, and inability to recognise the value
of testimony, or even to accept a chance of being convinced
by actual experience, tend to arouse our impatience ; but
there is some excuse. Most of the orthodox facts of to-day
had to encounter similar opposition at their entry, and were at
one time heterodox. It has been said that even scientific fact
is not generally accepted until it becomes a habit ; and, as
illustrating pardonable and natural scientific scepticism, it
may be instructive and helpful to quote here from an old
letter from a scientific friend about Crookes's experiments,
preserved and cited with approbation by Crookes himself :
—
" Any intellectual reply to your facts I camiot see. Yet it
is a curious fact that even I, with all my tendency and
desire to believe spirituahstically, and with all my faith
in your poAver of observing and your thorough truthfulness.
322 Sir Oliver Lo^ge [part
feel as if I wanted to see for myself ; and it is quite
painful to me to think how much more proof I want. Painful,
I say, because I see that it is not reason which convinces a
man, unless a fact is rej^eated so frequently that the impres-
sion becomes hke a habit of mind, an old acquaintance, a
thing known so long that it cannot be doubted. This is a
curious phase of man's mind, and it is remarkably strong in
scientific men,—stronger than in others, I think. For this
reason we must not always call a man dishonest because he
does not yield to evidence for a long time. The old wall of
belief must be broken down by much battering."
The fact that Crookes fully adhered to his exceptional ex-
periences, throughout his life, is sufficiently plain to members
of the S.P.R. from his "Notes of Seances with D. D. Home,"
written for the Proceedings of the S.P.R. in 1889 (see Vol. VI.,
page 98 et seq). Also from his holding the Presidential Chair of
the Society for three years, 1896-1899, and from his Presiden-
tial Address to the Society in 1897 (see Proc. Vol. XII., page
338).
While, later still, in the critical and quite unprivileged
atmosphere of the British Association, when he was President
of that body at its Bristol meeting in September 1898, the
concluding portion of his address speaks of " one interest
"
which to him was " the weightiest and the farthest reaching
of all," and continues :
—
" Thirty years have passed since I published an account of
experiments tending to show that outside our scientific know-
ledge there exists a Force exercised by intelligence differing
from the ordinary intelligence common to mortals. . . . To
ignore the subject would be an act of cowardice—an act of
cowardice I feel no temptation to commit. . . . There is
nothing for the investigator to do but to go straight on. . . .
to follow the light wherever it may lead. ... I have nothing
to retract. I adhere to my already published statements.
Indeed, I might add much thereto. I regret only a certain
crudity in those early expositions which, no doubt justly,
militated against then' acceptance by the scientific world."
Though several letters about the preparation of this Address
are printed in the volume under review, pp. 353-370, it seems
XCII.] The Life of Crookes 323
legitimate to add, now, that while drafting the address Crookes
was also in correspondence with F. W. H. Myers ; and we may
trace Myers's hand in its final and ante-penultimate paragraphs.
I know that Crookes accepted these suggestions with joy, and
rejected several other eloquent literary passages with regret.
It is only fair to his memory to quote here the final jiara-
graph ;
though it is among those quoted in the book, and
although Members of the S.P.R.. will find the whole of the
psychic portion of this British Association Address easy to
refer to in Proc. XIV., pp. 2 to 5.
" In old Egyptian days a well known inscription was carved
over the portal of the temple of Isis :
'
I am whatever hath
been, is, or ever will be ; and my veil no man hath yet lifted.'
Not thus do modern seekers after truth confront Nature—the
word that stands for the baffling mysteries of the universe.
SteadUy, unflinchingly, we strive to pierce the inmost heart of
Nature, from what she is to re-construct what she has been,
and to prophesy what she yet shall be. Veil after veil we
have lifted, and her face grows more beautiful, august, and
wonderful, with every barrier that is withdrawn."

Freiherr von Schrenck-Notzing. (Leipzig, 1924.)
The importance of a new contribution to human knowledge
can often be estimated by a consideration of the attacks
made upon it by the learned world. The scientific mind is,
unfortunately, only too often divided into watertight com-
partments, and presents the strange spectacle of the true and
the false, the sublime and the ridiculous, all flourishing under
the same mask of a united personality. In the ordinary
sciences of to-day, religion has but little influence. The
biologist does not fear that by presenting his work he is
encroaching upon the domain of the Almighty, neither does
the geologist regret that his results do not appear to tally
with the statements in the Book. Facts concerning natural
phenomena are now only condemned for these reasons in such
places as Kentucky or the Kingsway HaU, whilst serious
minded people smile quietly and pass on. But in psychical
xcii.] Telekinetic and Teleplastic Mediumship 325
research the scientist joins the priest, and the philosopher the
journalist in deriding phenomena just as real and objective as
the meteor or the eclipse. As long as reports were confined to
the novelist or to the seeker after wonders, the learned ^^'o^ld
could afford to smUe disdainfully and proceed on its way,
but when the facts were reported by men of science them-
selves the case assumed quite a different complexion. The
r more important the record the greater the attack, and the
more virulent the abuse from all quarters. Even if in England
we have failed to realise the importance of Dr. von Schrenck-
Notzing's contribution (I), in. Germany the attacks made upon
it reflect great credit upon its author. For the truth is that
it is by far the most important work on telekinesis since
the S.P.R. Report on Palladino or Dr. Ochorowicz's observa-
^
tions on Mile T. Tom from the centre of spiritistic circles
in which he was becoming rapidly hardened through the
traditions of the tune, young WLUy Schneider was taken by
Dr. von Schrenck and educated with a view to a single
,
purpose. That goal in brief was to train the mediumistic faculty
so that the same phenomenon could be repeated under the
same conditions at specified times and before varying observers.
It is in the achievement of this purpose that the importance
of Dr. von Schrenck's record may be said principally to lie.
The methods of control and the phenomena observed are
substantially the same as those described in the Journal for
e October, 1922. Control consists broadly in the holding of
the medium's hands and wrists by two persons and the out-
lining of his body by luminous pins. Phenomena occur usually
1 m. 10 cm. from the medium and are not hindered by the
presence of an intervening gauze screen. Four methods were
used : (A) the medium within a gauze enclosed structure and
the objects to be moved upon a table in front of the observers,
ie (B) The medium sitting freely in a chair and the objects enclosed
']3
within a gauze cage about 1 m. 10 cm. from the medium. (C)
:S The medium and the objects being 1 m. 10 cm. apart, the latter
being separated from the observers by a four-winged gauze
screen. (D) The medium and sitters being entirely cut off from
i the objects by a gauze enclosure. In all these four cases the
]S medium is held by two persons as described above. {8ee I.,
al Abb. 3-6, p. 43.) - ....... . ...= ..
326 E.J. Dingivall [part
Besides printing an account of his own sittings, Dr. von
Schrenck records those held in the Psychological Institute
of Munich University. The same phenomena were witnessed
repeatedly under the same conditions and, as far as can be
gathered from the reports, no member of the examining com-
mission came to unfavourable opinions as to the authenticity
of the phenomena presented. The record is mainly one of
impressions and observations. Fresh experiments were not
apparently encouraged if we except the tunnel apparatus
described on pp. 11, 12. In his attempt to describe the pheno-
mena Dr. von Schrenck leans towards the hypothesis of
teleplastic structures proceeding from the medium (pp. 44, 47,
49), a theory to which colour is lent by the fact that the
mesh of the gauze is opened when the objects are separated
from the medium (pp. 46, 47). Similarly the experiment
with tissue paper described on p. 48 supports the same hypo-
thesis, and the observations printed on pp. 14, 16, 23, 46 and
163 will especially interest those few amongst us who have
ever attempted to examine the physical phenomena from this
point of view.
Recognising the immense importance of the book and the
unanswerable character of the records, German students who
had the reputation of being hard-headed sceptics set about to
devise suitable replies. At least two avenues of attack were
open. One was to declare that the whole thing was ridicu-
lous, a preposterous and futile farce which could be left un-
noticed. Professor Karl Marbe adopted this course and
(incredibile dictu) the Preussische Jahrbiicher opened its columns
in hospitality (II). Beginning with Steiner he passes to the
sideric pendulum and the divining rod, proceeding to teU us
that " up till now there is not the slightest proof of telepathy
"
(p. 53). From telepathy Professor Marbe passes to Dr. von
Schrenck, but obviously cannot find any flaw in the control
or in the results. He therefore resorts to ridicule and aspersions
concerning WiUy's character and conduct. Finally in a burst
of almost hysterical frenzy he thus describes the book. It is,
he says, only " ein Album der Blamage, sondern auch als
eine Publikation, die mit den wahren Interessen des Volkes
im Widerspruch steht "
(p. 59) [not only a publication which
makes the author ridiculous, but also one which conflicts
I
xcii.] Telekinetic and Teleplasfic Mediumship 327
I
with the true interests of the people]. Dr. Hellwig is calmer
I
than Professor Marbe (III). He has read the book sine ira
{
et studio and has made " hundreds and hundreds of critical
I
notes," but unfortunately, he gives us no striking example
of them, contenting himself with vague complaints, such as
r the lack of light and Willy's aversion to apparatus. The
[
second avenue of attack was adopted by Prof. Henning (IV).
\ It consists essentially in the production of a person Avho can
j
present aU the phenomena of Willy Schneider under the
. same control conditions and yet manage to produce them
[ I fraudulently. Professor Henning has accomplished this grand
feat. He has discovered a Russian medium whose name he
3
forgets to give us. This person, under the full light of three
\ I
half-watt lamps of sixty candle power each, works in the centre
[ I
of the investigators. Objects, such as a large book, a tray,
,. a china plate, a newspaper or a walking stick rise into the
J
air at a distance from the medium and float to any observer
J
at command. A cigarette case opens itself and a cigarette
s
floats out of it finally settling in the medium's mouth. The
phenomena are just as good if the medium's hands and feet
g are held. Control of the medium's person can be insisted
D
upon not only before and after the sittings but at any time
Q
during the production of phenomena. None of the observers
g
i could explain the manifestations, and no confederates were
[.
necessary, " nur zwei fast mikroskopische kleine Behelfe " [only
[.
two almost microscopic little devices] M^hich could be used

,
without the help of hands, feet or head.

Professor Henning's contribution to the Zeitschrift fiir Psyclio-

dreams according to the Freudian interpretation. But as a
I practical contribution the story is spoilt by Professor Henning

revealing some of the amazing methods of this modern Yogi.

J
suffice to add that this amusing skit by Professor Henning
has actually been taken seriously in Germany in the same way
^j
as Dr. Mercier's Spirit Experiences was accepted in certain
,|j
quarters in England. Professor Max Dessoir published a
Ij
laudatory article in the Vossische Zeitung (V). He proposes
328 E. J. Dingivall [part
that Willy shall be tested by Henning's Russian medium, but
we fear that the latter is even more shadowy than the phan-
toms produced by the former. The fact alone of Henning's
skits being treated seriously by such a prominent scholar as
Professor Dessoir indicates the amount of animosity prevalent
abroad on the subject of Baron von Schrenck's experiments
with Willy Schneider. For the experiments form a solid basis
upon which to work, and Baron von Schrenck was indeed
fortunate to obtain the help of such a medium as Willy
Schneider. The easy and at the same time efficient methods of
control are typical of what can be done with a good medium
for telekinesis.
How different are the problems presented by teleplastic
mediumship ! In the one case control is simple if only the
medium can be persuaded to consent to it. In the other
control is difficult even when the medium offers himself ap-
parently unreservedly. In my discussion of the problems
involved in the case of Eva C.^ I tried to point out how
difficult it is to prevent objects being smuggled into the
seance room despite the utmost vigilance on the part of the
controllers, and Dr. von Schrenck in his turn criticised my
objections in the Proceedings for 1923. In the first paragraph
of that criticism Dr. von Schrenck compares his experiments
with Eva C. with those with WHly Schneider. But the com-
parison is, I think, invalid, since telekinetic mediumship differs
entirely from teleplastic mediumship in methods of control.
In dealing with the control of WUly Schneider I have said
elsewhere that my objections to the Baron's control of WUl}''
would be as strong as those against his control of Eva C.
were Willy to sit for telejilasm."^ There is no doubt whatever
in my own mind that Eva C, Willy Schneider, Jan Guzik,
Pasquale Erto, etc., can bring objects into the seance room in
spite of the control exercised in Munich, London or Paris.
Moreover the recent case of Erto shows quite conclusively
that such is the case in at least one instance. But the im-
portant point to emphasise is not what the mediums can
bring in, but what use they can make of what they do bring
in. Willy no doubt can bring in a telescopic rod, but of what
use is it to him ? None whatever. With telekinesis the con-
^ Proceedings, 1922, 309-331. ^Journal, 1922, p. 370,
r XCTI.] TeleJcinetic and Teleplastic Mediumship 329
troUers can prevent mediums using their apparatus presupposing
such to be brought with them. With teleplastic mediumship
the apparatus is the phenomenon. Judgment must not be
founded upon a sure control, although a good deal can be
done in this direction. It must seek a firmer basis upon the
appearance and (above all) behaviour of the phenomenon
itself. A dummy hand swathed in cotton wool does not behave
like that described upon p. 678 of Professor Richet's Traite
de Metapsychique {2" ed.), neither does a dummy head resemble
that mentioned- by Dr. Geley on p. 13 of the Bulletin of the
Inst. Gen. -Psychol. (Nos. 1-3, Paris, 1918). But since we
camiot dictate as to what supernormal phenomena must or
must not resemble, the case becomes even more complicajted
.
And in this very complication lies part of the secret of the
tragic and at the same time farcical story of Ladislaus Laszlo
(VI). Laszlo was an electrical artisan and is generally con-
sidered to be neuropathic. lii December 1921 he made the
acquaintance of M. WUhelm Tordai, who was legally con-
nected with the Finance Ministry at Budapest. Asking to
be investigated, Laszlo attracted the attention of M. Tordai
who became convinced of the authenticity of the phenomena
and formed a circle for their investigation. The conditions
were the same as those usually obtaining at such experiments.
Before the sitting Laszlo changed his clothes, donned a bath-
ing costume and occasionally took a bath. The cabinet and
surroundings were also said to be carefully examined. Dim
white light was used together with red light or sometimes
total darkness. Besides producing alleged teleplasm, luminous
phenomena were observed. In this connection it is interesting
and highly illuminating to read the accounts of the observers
before the exposure. I select the following passages and
translate them verbatim.
' Luminous phenomena appeared, at first close to the
medium's body but latterly at a distance of several metres
from him. The size of these lights varied from that of a
pea to that of a pigeon's egg. At times these lights moved
in rapid zig-zag lines resembling comets. . .
."
"A trembling of the Avhole body then set in. The hands
and feet become cold. Saliva in abundance drops to the
ground. After the flow of saliva there emerges from the
mouth a band of plasma 3 cm. broad and 20 cm. long."
330 E. J. Dingwall [pakt
On April 24th, 1923, a special test took place. The medium
was stripped, searched, and taken to a special room con-
taining the minimum of furniture. A purgative was adminis
tered, the stomach j)ump was employed and he was watched j |
for twenty-four hours before being taken to the seance room.i* is
At the sitting four photographs were taken of alleged tele- :
plasm emergmg from the mouth. They show a strip 5 to: i
6 cm. broad and 60 to 70 cms. long. At other sittings the I
[a
medium wore . a veil as in the case of Eva C. The director k
thus describes the phenomenon. I 51
" At this experiment I had shpped my hands under the
veil, separating it with forefinger and thumb and keeping it
as far away from the mouth of the medium as possible. With ']
the surface of my hand I controlled and guided involuntarily
the movements of the plasma. This time again, we could
clearly observe, in the red light, the withdrawal of the sub- ; f
stance through the veil and afterwards ascertain that the veili' la
was intact "
(p. 6). Mi
In criticising this account Baron von Schrenck compares the !
photograph with those taken with Eva C. and Stanislawa P.
He declares that with Eva the mouth is wide open and
the veil is not drawn into the cavity whilst with Stanis-
lawa a small portion of the substance is seen inside the
veU.i
How far Baron von Schrenck is correct in this assertion
I am not prepared to say. During the sittings with Eva in
London it was observed that the veil was drawn into Eva's
mouth, and I published a statement upon that very point.^i;
Moreover it appears to me that in Fig. 155 the veil is again i
drawn into Eva's mouth, and I cannot think that the case of
^
Stanislawa P. can be called conclusive from the fact that a
portion of the substance is seen behind the mesh apparently
inside it.
The apparent vitality of the substance was also noticed by
the Hungarian observers. With red light falling directly upon
the plasma a piece was seen upon the ground at a distance
of 60 cm. from the medium. " As if attached to an invisible t

thread, it crawled to his feet, climbing up the body and dis-
appeared into the mouth." ^
Upon other occasions the observers handled the substance.
The report reads : "A few seconds later, the white, cold and
foam-like plasma which lay on our hands withdrew into the
medium's mouth "
(p. 7). Upon hearing of the marvels Baron
von Schrenck visited Budapest and had four sittings with
Laszlo.
In his published accounts it is clear that he was far from
]
satisfied with the phenomena and general conditions. Indeed
i at the conclusion of the series, he wrote to M. Tordai expres-
sing his uncertainties. He advised him to so seize the pheno-
menon and ascertain its real nature. M. Tordai, however,
]y
disregarded his advice and gave a lecture upon Laszlo 's medium-
ship. A professional showman was present at the lecture, and,
approaching Laszlo offered him an engagement. To him
Laszlo confessed that the whole thing was fraudulent, and
proofs of his guilt were finally established. One of the
sitters '
had assisted him and examples of the substance in
the shape of old pieces of muslin soaked in fat, etc., were
discovered.
In Dr. von Schrenck's pungent criticism of the case two
principal points are raised. His first objection is that the
products were so artificial in appearance that they had to be
regarded with extreme scepticism. Now it is clear from the
passages I have quoted above that the Hungarian observers
were quite convinced of the authenticity of the phenomena
even though they themselves may have noticed marks of
artificiality. It is to be remarked that they reported self-
mobility, change of form and the passage of the substance
through the veil. Indeed from their reports it is difficult to
understand how the deception was carried on unless we re-
member the religious atmosphere of the performances. Passages
from the Bible were read and the medium's guide, " Dr. Grunhut,"
gave salutary advice. The circle had instituted the best
^ Cf. Mat.-Phaen., Figs. 128 and 130 where in the one case the sub-
stance lies on the medium's chest supported by a black thread from
the mouth and in the other (the second photograph) the same appear-
ance is seen suspended from the breasts, the black thread being entangled
with it.
332 E. J. Dingioall [part
I
control they could devise and it can scarcely be contended
that it was not severe. It is true that it was totally in-
efficient, like that of the medium Erto, but it was the best
these inexperienced observers could suggest. In spite of
all the medium succeeded in smuggling in his apparatus.
Even the artificial appearance of the products cannot be
considered proof of their normal origin. Dr. von Schrenck
himself would scarcely deny, I think, that certain of the pro-
ductions of Eva C. and Stanislawa P. suffer from the same
objection. The answer to this point Dr. von Schrenck him-
self i^artly furnishes when he speaks of the control of the
hands. For if the hands are held then the arrangement of
the products becomes a matter of some difficulty. Laszlo's
hands were sometimes held and sometimes not. Often the
hands were free behind the curtains between the appearance
of different phenomena.^ Scrupulous, though inefficient, in
the bodily control, the Hungarian enquirers failed to perceive
the enormous importance of the hand-control. It is this
inability to discriminate the important from the unimportant,
not only in actual sittings but in considering the literature
of the subject, that is at the root of many of the difficulties
of psychical research. For if observers camiot distinguish the
differences between, we will say, the phenomena of WiUy
Schneider and those of Palladino, or of Laszlo and Eva C,
then the results can never be accepted by serious students
The history of Laszlo is not more incredible than the amazing
performances of Eldred whose exploits were the wonder of
the spiritualistic world for some two years. A solid basis
for our work can only be found in such laborious series of
experiments as those conducted by Baron von Schrenck with
the medium WUly Schneider. If this series contrasted with
the Laszlo series teaches us anything, it is the radical differences
of treatment necessary in the investigation of telekinetic and
teleplastic mediumship.

REVIEW.
Supernormal Faculties in Man : An Experimental Study by
Eugene Osty. Translated from the French by Stanley
DE Brath, M.I.C.E. (London: Methuen & Co. 1923.
Pp. xi, 245. 15s. net.)
Dr. Osty is a French medical man who published in 1913 a
work on Lucidity and Intuition, embodying what he had learnt
by " three years' experimental study of the strange faculty
possessed by certain persons of revealing the course of an
individual life, and that without regard to the normal exercise
of their intelligence, to information from then* ordinary senses,
and to the insuperable obstacles which time and space put in
the way of our ordinary perception," and sums up his sub-
sequent researches in the present book. These, he claims (p.
vii), show that supernormal cognition is producible at will,
independent of beliefs and faith in witnesses, and is susceptible
of exact observation and indefinitely repeated experimentation.
It can hardly, however, be maintained that he succeeds in
making good this very large claim. For, though his book is
readable and full of interesting stories, and no one after reading
it could doubt either his good faith, his ingenuity, or his en-
enthusiasm, it is disappointing to find that his method of
'
experimenting '
is merely that of consulting the oracle of the
professional clairvoyants who seem to abound in France, and
recounting their successes with a considerable display of
technical terminology. This method may be repeatable in-
definitely, and even ad nauseam, but it hardly deserves to be
called '
experiment ' or even '
precise observation,' and correct
^ Mr. de Brath translates " revealing the sequences of individual lives
independently of normal intelligence, of normal sensorial information,
and also of the unavoidable obstacles ". . . , a rendering which reveals
the chief defect of his translation. It is adequate, though not always
accurate, in ordinary narrative (as when on p. 234 he translates '
gros
'
and '
wOTce ' by 'big' and 'small'), but tends to become obscure in
theoretical passages.
I
334 F. C. S. Schiller [part
results are certainly not producible by it at will. Dr. Osty of
coui'se knows this as well as anyone ; but it is only towards
the end of the book, in a valuable chapter on '
errors in
metagnomy '
that one learns that errors abound and " pervade
metagnomic seances in variable proportions. . . . Some seances
contain scarcely any, others contain a few, others many
"
(p. 205), and that Dr. Osty, though he has had " ideally good
seances," has never come across " an impeccable percipient
"
(p. 215). All are C3.pable of starting off on a wrong clue, and
incapable of distinguishing between a genuinely supernormal
vision, an impression telepathically imbibed from another mind,
and a product of the '
fabulation ' of their own subconscious
imagination. Moreover, their visions are always fragmentary,
and therefore frequently misleading ; and public seances, " or
even private seances at which several persons are present " are
conducive to error (p. 233). Yet it is evident that private
sittings at which only one '
experimenter '
is jiresent, and has
to record all that is said by both parties, are liable to errors
of a different type : they can never inspire confidence like a
sitting of which a contemporaneous proces verbal is extant. If
in addition one recognises that every subject is different and
has idiosyncrasies to be humoured, and that hardly a glimmer
of a theoretic explanation of the facts alleged is in sight, it
will not seem extravagant to say that we are still Yerj far
from being in a position to call supernormal cognition an
experimental study reproducible at will.
True there remains a considerable body of evidence in its t
favour, which can hardly all be explained away. Nor need it ji
be denied that Dr. Osty has materially added to it. But its
quaUty is unsatisfactory and not always above suspicion, and, i
so far as it is fact, it is still uncomprehended fact. Only
^
minute and co-operative study can be expected to yield the I
clues that will lead to explanations and to experimental con-
jj
trol over it. And for this purpose it will be necessary to
have more, and more complete, accounts of the exact proceedings i;
at the sittings at which apparently supernormal knowledge is '
obtained. Dr. Osty (p. 239) regards these demands as un-
reasonable, and never gives a record of even one of his sittings
in full, as a specimen of his procedure. The reader therefore
has to take his accounts on trust, and cannot check his in-
ler(
XCII.] Review 335
ferences. His excuse is that the accumulation of mere obser-
vations without hypotheses is very slow work, and that such
records are very dull reading. True, but the question is
whether they are not scientifically necessary in the present
state of the inquiry. They are at any rate more important
than that every investigator should start afresh with a new
terminology of his own, especially when it is incorrectly formed.
For the term '
metagnomy '
which Dr. Osty has adopted from
Boirac should mean not '
beyond-intelligence '
but '
a/ier-judg-
ment ' (or '
opinion '). Lack of agreement about terminology is
one of the least of the difficulties of psychical research ; but
what is siu-prising is that the French students of these subjects,
who are lacking neither in numbers, nor in enthusiasm, nor in
ability and scientific repute, should not band themselves to-
gether into a Society like ours.

APPENDIX II. TO MRS. SIDGWICK'S PAPER ON
PROFESSOR MURRAY'S EXPERIMENTS IN
THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.
The experiments made on December 6 and 7, 1924, of
which the record is given below, are of interest for three
reasons. In the first place, only two (Mr. G. W. Balfour
and Mr. Basil Murray) of the company had been present
at any of the previous experiments ; in the second place,
these are two of the very rare occasions on which experi-
ments have been attempted elsewhere than in Professor
Murray's own home or home-ckcle ; and in the third
place, three out of the five successes or partial successes
on December 6, 1924, were obtained when the subject
had been chosen by some one who had never been present
before at experiments of Professor Murray's.
Mr. Basil Murray was asked to choose the subject of
the first three experiments on December 6, because, the
surroundings being strange, it was thought that there
would be a better chance of success if a beginning were
made with an agent to whom Professor Murray was
accustomed.
The experiments on December 7, 1924, failed,—probably
because the conditions were unfavourable. It should be
noted that in one instance Professor Murray's impressions
seem to have been infiuenced by things that had happened
earlier in the day.

the rest of the company being m the drawing-room.
During his absence the drawing-room door was shut on
every occasion, and on the first occasion the dining-
room door was also shut. On subsequent occasions the
dining-room door was left open. When the subject of
the experiment had been chosen and recorded, Mrs.

in order to summon Professor Murray. The drawing-room

is separated from the dining-room by another room about

thirty-six feet in length. While the subject was being
^
i
chosen and recorded Professor Murray was separated by
. at least forty-six feet from the person nearest to the
t
drawing-room door. The account of the subject chosen
] ,
was dictated to the recorder in a quiet tone of voice :
5
in fact in so quiet a tone that more than once the
t
recorder had to ask for words to be repeated. On each

occasion Professor Murray held the hand of the person
I
who had chosen the subject. J. G. Piddington acted as

recorder of all the experiments except the 9th, which
e
was recorded by Basil Murray.

During two, if not three, of the first three experiments
—

all of which failed—there was talking among the experi-

having been sufficiently realised at first that talking or

the chances of success.

asked him to have one more try.
Fourth Experiment, 10.5 p.m.
Subject (chosen by J. G. Piddington, who, as he records it,
reads it out). "I'm thinking of Queen Victoria when she
learnt that she was next in succession to the throne sajong
'
I wiU be good '."
Professor Murray. " It's something in a book. No. it's
a picture. It's the news coming to Queen Victoria that
she is Queen."
Fifth Experiment, 10.10 p.m.
Subject {chosen by J. O. Piddington, who, as he records it,
reads it out). " I'm thinking of Napoleon on the retreat from
Moscow with Murat riding by his side."
Professor Murray. " No impression."
Sixth Experiment, \0.\2p.m.
Subject {chosen by Basil Murray).
"'
He stood and heard the steeple
Sprinlde the quarters on the morning town :
'
One, two, three, four.
On market place and people
It tossed them down.'
"
Professor Murray. " This is poetry " (said as he entered
the room). (Pause). " De dum de dum de steeple de
dum de dum the town, one two three four. Yes, I
don't know the thing, but I rather think it's something
like '
He stood and heard the steeple something and
something on the dreaming town something down.'
"
Note.—These same lines had been chosen several years before for
-an experiment, and the experiment had partially succeeded.
See page 233 above.
XCII.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 339
Seventh Experiment, 10.20 p.m.
Subject {chosen by Basil Murray). " I'm thinking of a
scene in Galsworthy's The White Monkey, where Soames Forsyte
is defying a shareholders' meeting.
Professor Murray. " I don't think I shall get it. Famt
impression of a line of Homer."
Eighth Experiment, 10.24 p.m.
Subject (chosen by Basil Murray). " I'm thinldng of my
sister Rosalind riding on a grey horse across Port Meadow
with Rupert Brooke."
Professor Murray. " It's gallopmg—somebody galloping
on grass over—I should say Port Meadow. It's (pause)
I should think it was Rosalind."
Basil Murray. " Yes, anyone with her ?
"
Professor Murray. " I should be guessing. Mr. Z. I
should say it was a grey horse."
Basil Murray. " That's odd, because I was thinking of
Mr. Z. I very nearly said that she was riding a dead
horse."
Professor Murray. " I very nearly said '
a dead horse.'
"
Note.—Mr. Z. was a horse-dealer who sold a friend of the
Murrays a dead horse.
Ninth Experiment.
Subject (chosen by J. O. Piddington). " I'm thinking of
Thomas a Becket being murdered in Canterbury Cathedral."
Professor Murray. ' This is something rather horrible
"
(spoken at once on entering the room). " Oh ! (Pause).
It's some one being murdered in a church or something
like that. (Pause.) I first thought it was somethmg
in the Bolshevist revolution, but I'm sure it isn't
Russian. Oh ! I should think it was the murder of
Thomas a Becket.
Note.—When the experiment was over, Piddington said that
le had thought of including in the subject " and saying
' Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit ' "
; but
:not being sure whether a Becket had said these words, he
'did not include them ; but nevertheless he had thought of
the text during the experiment. Professor Murray said he had
Jhad no impression of the text.
340 M7's. Henry Sidgwick [PART
When the ninth experiment was over Professor Murray-
suggested that Lord Balfour should choose the subject of
the next experiment.
Tenth Experiment, 10.37 p.m.
Subject {chosen by Lord Balfour). " I'm thinldng of Robert
Walpole talldng Latin to George I."
Professor Murray (speaking as he enters the room).
" Something Eighteenth Century." (Here Lord Balfour
nodded assent.) " I don't think I shall quite get it
exactly. Doctor Johnson meeting George III. in the
King's Library ; but I'm sure he's talking Latin to him—
•
which he didn't do. I don"t think I shall get it right.
Wait. I've nearly got it. Eighteenth Century. Somebody-
talking Latin to a kmg."
December 7, 1924.
FISHERS HILL, WOKING
Present—Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, Hon. Mrs. G. Cole, Misa
L. PiDDiNGTON, Messrs. G. W. Balfour, Basil Murray,.
J. G. PiDDiNGTON, Lord Balfour, and Professor G..
Murray.
Conditions the same as on December 6, 1924, except
that on every occasion the dining-room door, as -well as
the dra-wing-room door, -was shut, and that Professor
Murray -was summoned back to the dra-wing-room by
Miss Piddington instead of by Mrs. Sidgwick.
When asked whether he would be wiUing to try further
experiments Professor Murray had said he would be quite
willing to do so, but that he anticipated failure, as he
was not in the tranquil and serene mood favourable to-
success. The day had been a disturbing one for the
whole party, as in the morning Lady Betty BaKour had
broken her leg.
First Experiment, 9.32 p.m. :
Subject (chosen by Basil Murray). -
" I was the man the Duke spoke to ;
I helped the Duchess to cast off his yoke, too."
[Browning, The Flight of the Duchess.},
f
xcii.] Experiments in Thought-Transference 341
Professor Murray. " Is it Basil ? I don't expect this is
right. The only thing I'm getting is enormous tropical
forests.
Basil Murray. '
I was thinking of '
Ours is a great wild
country.' " [i.e. the first line of the passage in the
poem which describes the Duke's country : —which,
however, is not a tropical one.]
Professor Murray. I also had the feeluig of a tree fall-
ing down."
Note.—Earlier in tlie day there had been conversation about
tropical forests ; and the accident to Ladj^ Betty Balfour had
been in part caused by the fall of the rotten branch of a tree.
Second Experiment, 9.37 jj.w.
Subject {chosen by Basil Hurray). "I'm thinldng of my
sister throwing a ball to Jack Medley at a terrace at Alassio,
and of him falling over backwards m the attempt to catch it
—
over the edge of the terrace."
Professor Murray. " No. Nothuig at all."
Third Experiment.
Subject {chosen by J. G. Piddington). " Sir Waiter Raleigh
in a bad temper refusing to spread his cloak before Queen
Mizabeth."
Professor Murray. I thought for a moment I should get
that. No."
J. G. Piddington. " Did you get anything ?
"
Professor Murray. " I got a momentary impression of
the Duke of Wellington."
