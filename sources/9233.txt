I ended up in the intensive care unit of the Erasmus Hospital in Rotterdam. I saw a big black vacuum-like hole that seemed to exude great peacefulness. It was clear that the black hole was about to swallow me, but before I went in I was given a choice of many films that I could watch. There were black films and white films. The black films were the bad things I did in my life and the white films were the good things I did. I only wanted to see the white films; these films were of my young son from his birth until the present time. After I had watched all the white films all of them disappeared. The big black hole stopped it's vacuuming. It was obvious I wasn't welcome in the hole/tunnel. After that, I regained consciousness.

I'm not at all religious but all this was so intensely real that it certainly got me thinking. I've concluded there is much more to creation than merely what we can see.

No. I'd only like to know the significance of my experience and if anyone else has ever experienced anything similar to it.
