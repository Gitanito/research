let&#39;s start with some of the you know
observed phenomenon of these ET craft
you know if you go to serious disclosure
calm SAR IUS disclosure calm so it&#39;s
serious disclosure calm we have five six
dozen military witnesses testimony up
there we have the Orion project links
all these sort of papers but there&#39;s a
lot of information from these witnesses
of things that they observe such as
pilots who&#39;d be flying along and there
would be a spacecraft off their wing and
it didn&#39;t just fly off it D materialized
quote-unquote instantly right there on
on radar and just vanished well it&#39;s not
like they were hallucinating because it
was on radar and ground radar and
onboard radar this is what happened also
by the way with the famous Alaska case
where the Japan Airlines 747 heavy was
flying to polar route from Paris Tokyo
carrying champagne and whatever else
they carry on cargo jets from Paris and
they had this massive spacecraft appear
and it was the size of a battleship but
it was in the sky and it actually was a
CG five in the sense that the pilots
signaled to it put the hit the landing
lights on and a craft signal back so
there was there was contact well people
don&#39;t know that
you read the case of the captain the
Japan Airlines captain&#39;s account well
the the spaceship and this is all on our
site and in the book disclosure the
captain called in and had it on its
radar and called it in and of course it
ended up being on FAA radar which we
eventually from john callen got the faa
tapes and also a military radar military
jets were scrambled but this massive
object did not move in a linear way what
do i mean by that well it would be say
twelve o&#39;clock and instantly it would
then be at six o&#39;clock
this is something that was many times
the size of 747 and it moved in this
nonlinear way and they could not
understand it first they thought the
radar was malfunctioning that&#39;s what you
go to immediately because you know
normally you track even if you&#39;re
tracking you know a b-2 stealth or
something that&#39;s supersonic you&#39;re it&#39;s
very linear I&#39;m even four times the
speed of sound it&#39;s pretty slow or the
Space Shuttle at 25,000 miles per hour
is pretty slow and track that thing this
is not trackable so in a linear way
Chloe would be here and then here how
I&#39;ll get to this and by the way the same
thing happened Merle Shane McDowell
who&#39;s one of our witnesses who was down
here in Virginia Norfolk at the Atlantic
command and he was working under the
sink Atlantic command the commander in
chief Atlantic command Admiral Harry
train and they had a full what&#39;s called
full zebra alert where basically if you
don&#39;t have a zebra stripe on your badge
you got to get out of the command center
within 60 seconds or you&#39;re shot by the
Marines who have them 16s there to
enforce that I&#39;ve been at this facility
and in that area and they mean business
when you&#39;re in there and so they went to
full zebra alert the Admiral came down
into his observation area and the
syphilis huge facility and they had this
et craft on radar off the coast of
Newfoundland boom one radar sweep it be
off the coast of South Florida one radar
sweep boom he&#39;d be right off the coast
of Norfolk and then it went off over to
the Canary Islands
etc and so they actually did scramble
jets when it was in one area I think up
in the Northeast I got close enough to
take photos so the photos got classified
and put into the black pit of Calcutta
never to be seen again but daytime
there&#39;s a daytime event but the movement
on the radar clearly showed that it was
this very large as several hundred feet
estimate maybe the size of a football
field circular object and that&#39;s how it
was moving this is not your granddad&#39;s
Oldsmobile
clearly not using a jet engine or a
rocket or anything like that so young
people say what are the cases where you
have proof of this I said well we have
the observation we have the radar tapes
we have the documents we have what you
want you know but there what&#39;s behind
the phenomenon is stop for a minute and
say how is it doing this well it little
gets into what Einstein called this
spooky effect everybody know what spooky
effect is well Einstein observed that a
particle being - could be in two places
at once like that the same thing and so
he couldn&#39;t really explain it but he has
called it spooky the spooky effect and I
guess it was spooky if you were linear
in your thinking and geologic and
Einsteinian but it&#39;s not spooky when you
think about it the whole cosmos is
actually non-local because it&#39;s
conscious a few years ago there was a
journal physics journal that published
and it was actually on the front page of
Newsweek this is back in the late 80s
early 90s where they did a study and
what they were doing is that they were
studying photons and shooting them down
a area and they were there be an
aperture or window that it would go
through but what happened is that the
physicists found that when they thought
of where they were going to move the
photons changed course precognitive lee
in other words two photons reacted with
the thought and consciousness and intent
of the physicist and this was done over
and over again and proven this is
published in mainstream physics journals
but people say oh well that&#39;s
interesting well I don&#39;t know what know
what it means they chucked it aside
again it&#39;s the cool stuff that gets
chucked aside this is in the mainstream
physics journals you look this study up
and they of course you have people like
dr. Bob John of Princeton the Princeton
engineering anomalies Research Lab the
peer lab
and back in the 90s he and I spoke about
this he says you know what you&#39;re doing
out under the stars is it&#39;s sort of in a
clinical you know exponential way what
I&#39;m improving in the lab and that is
that everything is conscious and
everything can react to thought and
consciousness and so what he did at
Princeton he was professor emeritus of
engineering and some of his work has
been contained by some of his his
students is that he would have like a
random number generator like a machine
that just generates you know zeros and
ones or something like that and they&#39;d
have someone just sit and wasn&#39;t like
this was some psychic or you know
somebody it just ordinary people and
they would put their intention on it
that it would instead of putting out
zeros would help more once and sure
enough the bell curve distribution was
shift now or the other way but what was
really cool about it he then found that
if there were two people who were really
connected to each other loved each other
where there was a heart connection and
did it together the effect was
exponential ten times greater so what is
that and this was this is a mechanical
system it&#39;s just a thing spitting out
zero in the random number generator and
this has been proven over and over and
over and over and over again now there&#39;s
no linear contact between the person&#39;s
body the physical 3d 4d
and the machine it&#39;s just purely thought
intending and yet it affects it what
does this mean well it means that
everything is awake
everything has within its structure an
element of this non-local consciousness
mind that isn&#39;t bound to 3d space time
and so nonlocality is something that
began to be talked about by physicists
and then there was a medical doctor or
man that I got actually met once and
we&#39;re at a wonderful book called
recovering the soul
there was all these accounts of P of
scientists and also lay people finding
that
the mind and thought was always an
omnipresent field and could have effects
whether it was like an intersession Airy
prayer for someone you know one person
would be in Europe the other person in
Hawaii and they would have an effect etc
and so on or they would take saliva
which has you know white blood cells in
it and they take it you know to another
continent keep it alive in a petri dish
and they would put electrodes and those
white blood cells would register when
the person had an emotional reaction to
something consistently even though it
was out of their body cool I mean this
is the really cool stuff so if is that
everybody understanding this you know
lost too many people yet and what that
means the real kind of the bullet point
is the mind is always omnipresent your
mind my mind all mind because there&#39;s a
singularity of mine
Erwin Schroedinger the father of modern
quantum quantum mechanics it was really
powerful wave theory back I think it was
1908 said the total number of minds in
the universe is one that is it&#39;s a
singularity so mind stuff or
consciousness is a singularity now we
can be aware of our own awareness and
think well I&#39;m conscious and I&#39;m Steeve
and you attach it to yourself and your
ego or your your individuation let&#39;s
call it your individuality however it&#39;s
always at the same time on a without any
effort whether you know it or not tied
into this sort of omnipresent non-local
field of consciousness as it turns out
without effort now you can be shut off
from that or you can be tied into it the
meditative state and Samadhi is when you
get tied into the universal component
that&#39;s why meditation is it&#39;s the
quieting of the individual
mine to re-experience the non-local mind
the unbounded mind and this actually has
profound implications not only for
health and healing and contact as we&#39;ll
get to but in physics because if you
look at the cosmos everything is in fact
consciousness phasing and resonating as
a photon or star or a person or an
individual or tree
now this is not pantheism it&#39;s an
understanding that&#39;s a transcendent
understanding of this sort of
universality of the awake state the
awareness and this has been proven
scientifically this is not there have
been study after study after study some
of which I&#39;m citing here I don&#39;t want to
get belabor the point you can look these
up yourselves I&#39;m sure you can all know
how to read but I want to pull it
together into sort of a sort of an
awakening within yourself for the fact
that your nerves not limited to your
physical body and self even when you
think you are
you
