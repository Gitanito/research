This happened some 40 kilometers from my home. Instantly, at unbelievable speed I was at my father's place.  I was floating while roaming through the rooms of the house.  Then I was back in my body within a few seconds. All this happened in such a state of abundance that it couldn’t be described with our words.  I was in the hospital for a few months.  Then I got back to my normal life, but with a certain sense of observation of human beings, that I didn't have before. 
 
 I told this story to four people, as I didn't understand what had been happening to me.  Since this experience, I'm not scared of death anymore.
