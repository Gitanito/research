 World's Paper. 
For the Discussion and Diffusion of Truth, and Exposure of Error. 
1857-1861?  Weekly 
Sandusky, then Randolph, VT.  Publisher: A.C. Estabrook & Co..  Editor: Daniel Tarbell, Jr., editor, and after 1861, R.P. Ripley. 
1/1, 1857-1861)   $1.50 a year in advance, and $2.00 in arrears!  4 pp., 17 x 22.

 "This newspaper also discusses spiritual and other pressing issues of the day."  Tarbell was a cantankerous Yankee who started the journal because of the spirits' insistence that he do so (and their threats to his financial well-being if he did not).  He delighted in controversy.  In his autobiography, Incidents of Real Life (1883), Tarbell says he sold the journal and his press to R.P. Ripley in 1861 who removed the enterprise to Randolph.  Contributions by Tarbell, D.J. Mandell, Miss A.W. Sprague, et al.  Because of Estabrook's involvement, this may be related to the Green Mountain Sybil.  University of Rochester
