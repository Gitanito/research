  		              		Experience Description   

    I was with my father, his friend, and the friend's older son who was  8 or 9 years old.  We were walking along a fast-moving, crystal-clear creek in Michigan.  It was mid-summer.
  
  We were checking fishing set-lines. My father had told me to stay away from the creek bank. I did not listen to him and slid down the bank and into the water. It was very cold.
  
  I was trying to breathe in while completely under water. I was confused as to why I wasn't getting any air. There was absolutely no pain, panic, fear, or anxiety.
  
  I was looking up and could see the older boy on the bank. Then I saw  beautiful, rainbow lights. 
  
  Then I was several feet up in the air.  I saw and heard the older boy yelling to my father and his dad that I had fallen into the water.
  
  The fathers had walked far up the creek bank.  I became very scared because my father had warned me not to go near the creek. 
  
  The dads were running back towards the site. I looked down and saw my body in the creek.  I couldn't understand why I was looking at myself from up in the air, but it seemed nice, fun, and interesting. 

  However, I knew my dad would spank me for disobeying him. That's what drove my fear. So, I was thinking about how I would get myself out of the creek while up in the air watching myself. I didn't know what to do.
  
  Then I saw the older boy grab my body by the hair and try to pull me out of the water but he couldn't. 
  
  As I was watching this, I felt myself becoming less interested and felt like leaving because, somehow, I knew there was a really nice place just a moment away. I began to want to go there very much.
  
  My dad got there on the bank and pulled me out. I saw myself lying face up on the bank and my father pushing on my chest.
  
  The fathers and the older boy were very distressed and yelling.  I was scared that my dad would spank me, so I was going to go to that other place I could sense was very near.
  
  Then something or someone 'pushed' me from behind and I woke up in my body. My chest was burning. The pain was intense.  I was coughing and vomiting water.

  I don't remember anything the others said.  I was so angry for being back when I was so near that beautiful place that I never saw; but I knew was there. 
  
  I was crying, but not from fear or panic. I felt it was so unfair that I had to come back to my body.

Date NDE Occurred:   	 Approx 1952  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Uncertain.    Drowning.  CPR given.     Other: Too young to know what was happening to me.  I was 3 or 4 years old. I did not have a clue about death.  
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Both pleasant AND distressing  

Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  I was only scared when I saw my father pull me out of the water because I thought he would spank me.  I was somewhat annoyed that I had to hear things.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I couldn't understand what was happening to me, but it felt 'right' and natural.  I saw beautiful lights. It was like I was a part of the world around me and Michigan in the summer is beautiful beyond words when you are a child.  I knew without a doubt there was a place even more beautiful just a blink away.  I have never felt that good since.  
  
At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         While I was up in the air  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Faster than usual  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     I was 3 or 4 years old. Time was meaningless at that age.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.        I was a child. I've never needed glasses but everything was sharply in focus. Like the colors were flowing liquid.  
  
Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I really didn't feel like listening to anything because the experience of vision was so intense.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain.     I knew there was a place to go but something or someone made me understand it was not to be yet.

  Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   Have you ever seen sunlight glisten on rippling water or  rainbows of colors?  Multiply that until it numbs your senses.  That is the only way I can explain it.  
  
Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         No       

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Awe. Mild confusion. Pleasant.

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will.  I was angry that I couldn't go on.
