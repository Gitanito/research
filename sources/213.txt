 This is an unusual journal.  It was Spiritist, as it could hardly help being, but was also Christian and professed strong admiration for the principles of Freemasonry, and believed there was good evidence from the spirits that Spiritism needed to be corrected.  It began to be published at the same time as the three journals then being published in Bordeaux (Ruche Spirite Bordelaise, Voix d'Outre-Tombe, and Sauveur des Peoples -- the last of which Lefraise edited and published) were being consolidated into the Union Spirite Bordelaise/La Union Spirite ou les Mysteres d'Outre-tombe Devoiles.  On the merger, see the notes under those journals.  Lefraise, a lawyer and former notary, was an ardent Freemason (he signed articles in the journal with R.C. trois puncts) and wrote articles on "Spiritism and Freemasonry" and on "Spiritism from a Religious Point of View."  Most of the issues contained a serialized article by Emilie Collignon (emilie Aimee Charlotte Breard Collignon, 1820-1902) on "Familiar Discussions on Spiritism," later published as a book.  She was Belgian and had been the writing medium for J.-B. Roustaing (1805-1879) in producing the spirits' enormous commentary on the four Gospels (which had the temerity of disagreeing with Allan Kardec on many points).  The journal also contained "Spirit Communications" from "Medium Breard" who is probably Collignon (Breard is her maiden name), and gave communications from Spirit Francis Xavier and Benjamin Franklin, among others.  On closing the journal after a year, Lefraise explained that the journal had been begun to explain to "developper la dictrine du Spiritisme," and was no longer necessary to complement his Sauveur des Peuples.
