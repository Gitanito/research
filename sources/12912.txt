My parents were busy inside the house. My brother got in the first canoe and paddled a hundred yards or so toward the middle of the lake. I reached for the second canoe and fell into the lake. I remember blacking out. 

The next thing I remember was me, about 10 feet away from my body.  I was looking at the body, whose eyes were closed.  The body appeared to be floating at the bottom of the lake's mud wall. I remember looking at myself for a short period of time. Time seemed like it was going in slow motion. When I was outside of my body, I felt the most intense feeling of inner peace that I have ever felt. It looked like there was at least four feet of water above my body. I felt myself moving toward and joining my body. 

At the point of joining my body, things got dark and I found myself on the shore with no one around me.
