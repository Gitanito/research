I still remember it very well. I started to leave my body and I flew through a white tunnel. It was a ring moving slowly around me. I still remember feeling that the ring was moving me away from my body and into the tunnel. I was trying to resist that.  I was not sleeping. I was awake. I was in a semi-sitting position, looking at the tunnel, resisting the ring’s push. I was conscious because I remember my mom sitting beside me trying cold compresses to reduce my fever.  My parents told me after many years that I was in a very critical condition and they took me to the hospital. I still have that feeling as if I was leaving this world.
