  		              		Experience Description   

    I was downtown Denver and came across a dude who thought I stole his skateboard. I told him I just got into Denver. He still kept  accusing me of stealing his skateboard. I was homeless at the time, so I got up and he was walking away.  I started to run away and he started  chasing after me in downtown Denver. As we were running, he got ahold of my shirt and ripped it off of me. I ended up losing my backpack with all my stuff in it. We ran through alley-way. Then we were outside of a hotel.  I was yelling, 'Help! Help! Somebody help! while the dude just kept throwing punches. A black dude came up and tried to intervene, saying 'Hey! Stop! Get off of him!' Then my attacker pulled out a knife.  I was thinking, 'Oh shoot! I'm going to die right here!'  I was somehow  able to hit him in the head, which  distracted him briefly. He then went full crazy  on me and I got knocked out when my head hit  the ground. 

   I saw a very bright light almost like at the end of a tunnel. It  made me so warm and happy.  I could just the see clouds and then I heard voices in the background. 

    I was blacked out for maybe a good 20 minutes.  I fully woke up at around  5 in the morning in the hospital with IVs in my body. At the time, I didn't know what they were start so I was pulling them out. They let me go. I left the hospital and tried to understrand what happened the night before.  I  felt so alive and like I had a better purpose in life. The experience  was  like a wake-up call.
