I could hear what everyone was saying during my operation. 

I was above my body and also in the wall. I felt that I was in the whole room at once, the whole clinic, even the whole world! 

Then there was a peaceful silence, and I felt very well. 

A tunnel opened up and I could see, feel, and smell a loving energy. All was love. This seemed to last a long time. 

Then, two days later, I awoke from a coma. 

That's it.
