When my heart stopped, I became conscious of going into a weightless state and moving off. Actually lifting off, above the gurney in the emergency room. There was much whiteness and a sense of peacefulness. I mused about the lifting without any pressure on my backside. Then I awoke and was being attended to after ‘shock treatment’. I feel, much as I had in the past, no fear of death.
