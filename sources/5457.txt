KEY to PHYSIC
AND THE
OCCULT SCIENCES..
WISDOM is the light ofReafon, and the bond of Peace. It affimilates
Man to God, and elevates his mind above unworthy purfuits. It is the
principal excellence which diftinguifhes him from brutes, and the chief
ornament that dignifies his charadter. Whatever is founded in Wifdom’s laws,
defies the mouldering hand of time, and ranks. with immortality. Hence it is
that a thirft after knowledge is natural to man ;
and, if the cares and follies of this
world could be eftranged from his concerns, his defire of information would be
infeparable from his exiftence. Ignorance and fuperflition may be confidered
as the curfe of God, which chains its votaries to unworthy objedts ;
whilft, on the-
contrary, wifdom and underftanding provide us with wings, whereby to foar above
the earth; to contemplate the works of creation—to difcern the myfteries of divi-
nity, and converfe with angels.
The beautiful defcription given by Solomon of his acquirements in wifdom, is
highly deferving the attention of all men ;
but particularly of thofe who profefs
the fcience of phyfic, and the cure of fouls. Iprayed, fays Solomon, and under
-
Jtanding was given me; I called upon God, and the fpirit of wifdom came to me. All
good things came with her, and innumerable riches in her hand, Wifd. vii. 7, 11.
What greater reward could any one defire? And though the intelledfual faculties
of all men are not alike flrong and apt for occult fpeculations ;
yet it is manifeft

that all perfons are capable of deriving great improvements from reading ;
and,
that it is not fo much the want of natural ability, as of induftry and application,
that fo many men difgrace the image of the Deity, and degrade the venerable
profeffions of Divinity, Phyfic, and Law.
It rarely happens that the want of intellect, or natural endowments of the mind,
are the rocks on which men fplit in their profeffional chara6ter. Indocile and
unapt indeed muft that man be, whom education, experience, obfervation, read-
ing, or enquiry, will not fet generally right in his progrefs through life. Yet,
without induftry, and an anxious defire of knowledge and improvement, neither
education, nor all the advantages of natural ability, can fave us from the wreck of
error, or the difgrace of ignorance. Obftinate men, though of the firft capacity
in the world, are a forlorn hope, and often irrecoverably loft, by unadvifedly pur-
fuing the phantom of'their own brain; wftilft others, enriched by dignity of fenfe,
and qualified by depth of underftanding to form the brightest charadters amongft
fociety, furrender up their talents for difcernment and enquiry, and content them-
felves with taking upon truft whatever they fee or hear ;
particularly in the prac-
tice of phyfic, in the law, and in the church. The mifchiefs attendant on this ge-
neral condudl of mankind, are great and many; for by thus implicity fubfcribing
to the vague notions, and falfe dodtrines, of others ;
by fhutting their eyes againft
the light of reafon and enquiry, and refufing to receive the convidtion of their own
fenfes, they transfer error from one generation to another, until the unlettered
multitude, dazzled by the fplendid ignorance of the learned few, become difciples
to their miftakes, and make error and enthufiafm an hereditary difeafe.
Hence, then, we fee the neceffity of confuiting our own reafon, and employing
our own underftanding, in the difcrimination of all our temporal and eternal af-
fairs; and of adting and judging for ourfelves on all occafions which immediately
regard our health, our happinefs, or our life; and under all thofe affiidtions and
misfortunes wherewith we ftruggle in this world, in our paffage to a better; to one
more gloriousa nd permanent; the ultimate end and reward of all our labours !
Our fenfes, on thefe occafions, are ever ready to fupport our endeavours, and per-
form their office; and it is unqueftionably the duty of all men to exercife, to im-
prove, and employ them. Yet it is aftonifhing in general to fee how diftruftful
we are of thofe very faculties Nature has given us for our guide, and how fondly
we fubmit to the opinions of others, whofe nerves cannot feel for us, and whofe
judgment is often founded upon erroneous principles, and fometimes on no princi-
ples at all. This, however, is a conduft by no means fitted to the dignity and office
aftigned to man ;
who being placed at the head of all God’s works upon earth,
walking
3
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES.
walking in his image, and exercifing dominion over his creatures, is bound to im-
prove that intellect of reafon and underftanding, whereby he is to govern and di-
redt them, according to the dictates of truth, of juftice, and ot mercy. For this
purpofe he ought, like Solomon, to ftudy the occult properties and qualities of all
things :
“ from the cedar-tree that is in Lebanon, even unto the hyffop thatfpring-
eth out of the wall with whatever relates to a proper knowledge of himfelf, “ and
of beads, and of fowls, and of creeping things, and of fiihes”—not to worfhip the
fun, nor the moon, nor the dars, nor any of the hod of heaven ; but to condder, to
admire, and to invedigate their charadters, fixed by the hand of God for dgns and
for feafons, and for days and years. They, in fadl, contain no more than what
every man ought to be acquainted with, to the bell of his abilities; becaufe they
lead to a comprehendve idea of thofe occult caufes and effedts, which adt the mod,
though they are the lead feen; and whereby the human underftanding is enlight-
ened and improved, and the mind enriched with thofe divine precepts, which lead
to a manifedation of that FIRST and omnipotent CAUSE to whofe power all
fecond caufes are fubfervient, and operate but as the, agents of his Will ;
and
under whofe provident care and fufferance we fee, feel, move, fpeak, and have our
being! The ten thoufand blefdngs which refult from this dudy, are found in our
enquiries after truth, and the myfteries which furround us; of the adonifhing fym-
pathy and antipathy betwixt heavenly and earthly lubdances ;
of the wonderful
harmony and conftrudtion of the celedial bodies; of the nature and qualities of our
own exidence, and the propagation of our fpecies ;
of the occult properties im-
planted in all created beings; and the end for which they are and were created !
To fuch enquiries all men are alike competent, and may boad the fame preten-
fions, unlefs obdinacy or indolence is fubdituted to prevent them. There is cer-
tainly implanted in the human mind, a power which perceives truth, and commands
belief, in all the occult properties of nature, not by the force of argument, nor learn-
ing, nor fcience ;
but by an indantaneous, inftindtive, and irreddibie, impulfe, de-
rived neither from education nor from habit, but from the peculiar gift of Provi-
dence, adting independently of our will, whenever thefe objedts are prefented,
bearing evidence of their reality, even when the pride of our external deportment,
and our very words, affedt to deny them. This is an intelledtual fenfation, which I
will venture to affirm, is felt more or lefs by all mankind; and I know the hearts of
all my readers, if not their tongues, will admit the fadt. It is therefore evident that
the humble cottager, the claffical curate, the regular phydcian, and the village doc-
tor, Hand on the fame level in this refpedt. The ftudy of Nature’s laws, of the oc-
cult properties in medicine, and in the frame and temperature of our bodies, is no

A KEY TO PHYSIC
lefs fimple, than important to our welfare; and without knowing thefe, we know
nothing that can place us beyond the fagacity of the brute creation. We can nei-
ther forefee danger, nor lliun it when it is near—we are fubjetd to mifguided treat-
ment, and miftake, in our medical applications, and advice—we receive intuitive
figns and tokens of misfortune or advantage, w'ithout knowing how to benefit by
the admonition In fhort, without this ftudy, our enquiries are vain—our percep-
tions are clouded—our views limited, and all our purfuits are vanity, vexation, and
difappointment. The weaknefs of our reafon, and the avocations arifing from the'
infirmities and neceffities of our fituations, require the moil powerfu linftrudtions,
and the cleared: perceptions of heavenly and earthly things, for the prefervation
of our fouls and bodies, and for the illumination of our minds; advantages that
can in no wife be more completely obtained than by an intimate acquaintance
with the Occult Sciences, or, in other words, by a contemplation
OF GOD.
THOUGH God has given us no innate ideas of himfelf, yet having furnilhed us^
with thofe faculties our minds are endowed with, heliath not left himfelf without
a witnefs; fince we have fenfe, perception, and reafon, and cannot want a clear
proof of him, as long as we carry any thought of ourfelves about us. To fhow,
therefore, that we are capable of knowing, that is, being certain, that there is a.
God; and how we may come by this certainty, I think we need go no farther than
ourfelves, and that undoubted knowledge we have of our own exigence. I think
it is beyond queflion, that man has a clear perception of his own being : he knows
certainly that he exifts, and that he is fomething. In the next place, man knows,
by an intuitive certainty, that bare nothing can no more produce any real being,
than it can be equal to two right angles. If, therefore, we know there is fome real
being, it is an evident demonflration, that from eternity there has been fomething
;
fince what was not from eternity had a beginning ;
and w'hathad a beginning mull
be produced by fomething ell'e. Next it is evident, that what has its being from
another muft alfo have all that which is in and belongs to its being from another
too ; all the powers it has muft be owing to, and received from, the fame fource.
This eternal fource of all being, muft be alfo the fource and original of all power
;
and fo this eternal being muft be alfo the moft powerful.
Again, man finds in himfelf perception and knowledge : we are certain then that
there is not only fome being, but fome knowing intelligent being, in the world.
There was a time when there was no knowing being, or elfe there has been a know-
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. $
ing being from eternity. If it be faid, there was a time Avhen that eternal being
had no knowledge; I reply, that then it is impoffible there ffiould have ever been
any knowledge; it being as impoffible that things wholly void of knowledge, and
operating blindly, and without any perception, lhould produce a knowing being,
as it is impoffible that a triangle ffiould make itfelf three angles bigger than two
right ones. Thus, from the confideration of ourfelves, and what we infallibly find
in our own conffitutions, our reafon leads us to the knowledge of this certain and
evident truth, that there is an eternal, moil powerful, and knowing, being, which
whether any one will call God, it matters not. The thing is evident ;
and from
this idea, duly confidered, will eafily be deduced all' thofe other attributes we
ought to afcribe to this eternal Being.
From what has been faid, it is plain that we have a more certain knowledge of
the exiftence of a God than of any thing our fenfes have not immediately dis-
covered to us. Nay, I prefume I may fay, that we more certainly know that
there is a God than that there is any thing elfe without us. When I fay, we
know, I mean, there is fuch a knowledge within our reach, which we cannot mifs,
if we will but apply our minds to that, as we do to other inquiries.
It being then unavoidable for all rational creatures to conclude, that Something
has exifted from eternity, let us next fee what kind of thing that muft be. There
are but two forts of beings in the world, that man knows or conceives : fuch as
are purely material without fenfe or perception; and fenfible perceiving beings,
fuch as we find ourfelves to be. Thefe two forts we fhall call cogitative and incogita-
tive beings ;
which, to our prefentpurpofe, are better than material and immaterial.
If then there muft be Something eternal, it is very obvious to reafon, that it muft
necefiarily be a cogitative being;, becaufe it is as impoffible to conceive that bare
incogitative matter ffiould ever produce a thinking intelligent being, as that no-
thing of itfelf Should produce matter. Let us fuppofe any parcel of matter eter-
nal, we fhall find it in itfelf unable to produce any thing. Let us fuppofe its parts
firmly at reft together ;
if there were no other being in the world, muft it not eter-
nally remain fo, a dead una&ive lump ? is it poffible to conceive that it can add
motion to itfelf, or produce any thing? Matter then, by its own Strength, cannot
produce in itfelf fo much as motion. The motion it has, muft alfo be from eter-
nity, or elfe added to matter by Some other being, more powerful than matter. But
let us fuppofe motion eternal too; yet matter, incogitative matter, and motion,
could never produce thought. Knowledge will ftill be as far beyond the po wer of
nothing to produce. Divide matter into as minute parts as you will, vary its figure
and motion as much as you pleafe, it will operate no otherwife upon other bodies
No. 1. C of
6 A KEY TO PHYSIC
of proportionable bulk than it did before this divifion. The minuteft particles of
matter, knock, repel, and refill, one another, juft as the greater do; and that is all
they can do : fo that, if we fuppofe nothing eternal, matter can never begin to
be: if we fuppofe bare matter without motion eternal, motion can never begin to
be: if we fuppofe only matter and motion eternal, thought can never begin to be:
for it is impofiible to conceive, that matter, either with or without motion, could
have originally, in and from itfelf, fenfe, perception, and knowledge; as is evident
from hence, that then fenfe, perception, and knowledge, rauft be a property eter-
nally infeparable from matter, and every particle of it. Since, therefore, whatfo-
ever is the firft eternal being, muft necelfarily be cogitative ;
and whatfoever is hi ft
of all things, muft necelfarily contain in it, and actually have at leaftall the perfec-
tions that can ever after exift ;
it necelfarily follows, that the firft eternal being can-
not be matter. If, therefore, it be evident, that fomethingmuft necelfarily exift from
eternity, it is alfo as evident, that that fomething muft be a cogitative being. For
it is as impoffible that incogitative matter lliould produce a cogitative being, as that
nothing, or the negation of all being, lliould produce a pofitive being, or matter.
This difcovery of the necelfary exiftence of an eternal mind fulficiently leads
us to the knowledge of God; for it will hence follow, that all other knowing beings
that have a beginning, muft depend on him, and have no other ways of knowledge
or extent of power, than what he gives them; and therefore, if he made thofe, he
made alfo the lefs-excellent pieces of this univerfe, all inanimate bodies, whereby
his omnifcience, power, and providence, will be eftablillied; and from thence all
his other attributes necelfarily follow.
Thus, a manifeftation of the Deity is viftble in all his works. There is not the
fmalleft part of that immenfe fpace our eyes behold, or our imaginations conceive,
that is not filled with His prefence. The worlds which revolve with fo much order,
beauty, and harmony, through the immenfity of fpace, the fun, moon, liars, and
planets, are upheld by the light of his countenance; but for which they would drop
from their orbs, and, plunged into the vail abyfs, would return to their primitive
chaos. To the mercy of God we ow e all the blelfmgs of this life, as the reward of
good and virtuous adlions. To his anger, we juftly attribute all violent conculftons
of the elements, famine, plague, peftilence, &c. brought on a wicked and aban-
doned people, like the ftorm of fire and brimftone on Sodom and Gomorrah. The
vengeance of the Deity cannot be more awfully defcribed, than by David in his
Pfalms ;
w'hich fihould a6t as a timely warning to thole atheifts and unbelievers, and
to thofe wicked, idolatrous, and polluted, countries, againft whofe deteftable crimes
thefe terrible fcourges have been fo often fent. The fhaking of the earth ;

AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 7
trembling of the hills and mountains ; the flames of devouring fire darting through
the firmament; the heavens bending down with forked thunderbolts; their riding
on the clouds, and flying on the wings of a whirlwind, the burfting of the light-
nings from the horrid darknefs; the tremendous peals of thunder; the florms of
fiery hail; the melting of the heavens, and diffolving into floods of tempeftuous
rains; the earth opening and fwallowing up her inhabitants; the rocks and moun-
tains cleaving afunder, and difclofingtheir fubterraneous channels, their torrents of
water, and bituminous fire, at the very breath of the noftrils of the Almighty; are
all of them circumfiances which fill the guilty mind with horror and difmay, and
admirably exprefs the power, the prefence, and the omnifcience, of God
!
To what has been ftated above, I would earneftly recommend an attentive pe-
rufal of what I have written in the firft volume of my Complete Illuftration of
the Occult Sciences, from page 61 to 71; whence it will be manifeft to the full
eonvidton of the moft obftinate atheifi, (if fuch a thing can really exifi,) that there
is a God, all-powerful and intelligent; fupremely perfe6t; eternal and infinite;
omnipotent and omnifcient ;
who endures from eternity to eternity, and is prefent
from infinity to infinity !
But though, from the nature and perfections of the Deity, he is invifibly prefent
in all places, and nothing happens without his knowledge and permiflion ;
yet it is
exprefsly revealed in Scripture, and admitted by all wife and intelligent authors,
that he is vifibly prefent with the angels and fpirits, and bleffed fouls of the de-
parted, in thofe manfions of blifs called Heaven. There he is pleafed to afford a
nearer and more immediate view of himfelf, and a more fenfible manifefiation of his
glory, and a more adequate perception of his attributes, than can be feen or felt in
any other parts of the univerfe; which place, for the fake of pre-eminent diftindlion,
and as being the feat, and centre, from whence all things flow, and have their be-
ginning, life, light, power, and motion, is called the interior, or empyrean, heaven.
The pofition and order of this interior heaven, or centre of the Divinity, has been
varioufly defcribed, and its locality fomewhat difputed among the learned; but all
agree as to the certainty of its exiftence. Hermes Trifmegiftus defines heaven to
be an intellectual fphere, whofe centre is every where, and circumference no where
;
but by this he meant no more than to affirm, what we have done above, that God
is prefent every where, and at all times, from infinity to infinity, that is to fay,
without limitation, bounds, or circumference. Plato fpeaks of this internal hea-
ven in terms which bear fo ftridta refemblance with the books of Revelation, and
in fo elevated and magnificent a ftyle, that it is apparent the heathen philofophers,
notwithftanding their worfhipping demi or falfe gods, poffeffed an unlhaken con-
fidence
s A KEY TO PHYSIC
fidence in one omnipotent, fupreme, over-ruling, Power, whofe throne was the
centre of all things, and the abode of angels and bleffed fpirits.
To defcribe this interior heaven, in terms adequate to its magnificence and glory,
is utterly impoffible. The utmoft we can do, is to colledt from the infpired writers,
and from the words of Revelation, aflifted by occult philofophy, and a due know-
ledge of the celeftial fpheres, that order and pofition of it, which reafon, and the
divine lights we have, bring neareft to the truth. That God muft be ftridtly and
literally the centre, from whence all ideas of the Divine Mind flow, as rays in every
dire6tion, through all fpheres, and through all bodies, cannot admit of a doubt.
That the inner circumference of this centre is furrounded, filled, or formed, by
arrangements of the three hierarchies of angels, is alfo confonant to reafon and
Scripture, and forms what may be termed the entrance or inner gate of the empy-
rean heaven, through which no fpirit can pafs without their knowledge and per-
miflion ;
and within which we muft fuppofe the vaft expanfe or manfions of the
Godhead, and glory of the Trinity, to be. This is ftridtly conformable to the idea
of all the prophets and evangelical writers. From this primary circle, or gate of
heaven, Lucifer, the grand Apoftate, as Milton finely defcribes it, was hurled into
the bottomlefs abyfs; whofe office, as one of the bigheft order of angels, having
placed him near the eternal throne, he became competitor for dominion and power
with God himfelf! But,
Him the Almighty Pow’r
Hurl’d headlong flaming from th’ ethereal fky,
With hideous ruin and combuftion, down
To bottomlefs perdition, there to dwell
In adamantine chains and penal fire!
Milton,
Parad. Lojt, b. i. 1. 44, See.
The circles next furrounding the hierarchies, are compofed of the miniftering an-
gels and fpirits, and meflengers of the Deity. In pofitions anfwering to the ideas
of the holy Trinity, and interfering all orders of angels, are feated, in tulnefs of
glory and fplendor, thofe fuperior angels, or intelligent fpirits, rvho anfwer to the
divine attributes of God, and are the pure eflences or ftream through w hich the w ill
or fiat of the Godhead is communicated to the angels and fpirits, and inftantaneoully
conduced to the Anima Mundi. Round the whole, as an atmofphere round a pla-
net, the Anima Mundi,
or univerfal Spirit of Nature, is placed ;
which, receiving the
impreflions or ideas of the Divine Mind, condudts them onward, to the remoteft
parts of the univerfe; to infinity itfelf; to, and upon, and through, all bodies, and to
all God’s works. This Anima Mundi is therefore what we underftand ot Nature, of
Providence,

Providence, of the prefence of God, and the fountain or feat of all fecond caufes,
being, as it were, the Eye of God, or medium between God and all created
things. Next to the Anima Muncli, is that vaft region or expanfe, called the
ethereal heaven, or firmament, wherein the fixed ftars, planets, and comets, are
difpofed ;
and wherein the celeftial bodies, and the comets, move freely in all
diredlions, and towards all parts of the heavens.
To illuftrate what has been ftated above, I have fubjoined a plate of the Inte-
rior Heaven, with the different orders of the Spirits and Effences of the Divine Mind,
diftinguilhed by their proper names and charadters, in the original Hebrew text,
as pointed out in holy writ, and in the manufcripts of ancient and learned philo-
fophers. As thefe names and characters are printed at length, and fully ex-
plained in the firft volume of my Uluftration of the Occult Sciences, p. 69, 70,
and 71, it is unnecelfary to repeat the fame here ; but for a more perfedt explana-
tion of what is there written, the annexed plate is abfolutely neceffary to aflift
the inquifitive reader in forming a competent underttanding of the fubjedt. It
will alfo appear from this plate, in what manner the rays or beams of Divine
Providence pafs from the centre or feat of the Godhead, through all the different
orders of angels and fpirits, to the Anima Mundi, and from thence to all the
celeftial bodies, planets, and ftars ;
to our earth, and to the remoteft parts of infi-
nite fpace, conftituting what is termed celeftial influx, or that faculty in nature by
which the quality and temperature of one body is communicated to another.
OF NATURE.
No one expreffion, ufed by authors, or fpoken amongft men, is in general more
varioufly applied, or fo little underftood, as the word Nature. When fpeaking of
the nature of a thing, we moft commonly mean its effence ;
that is, the attri-
butes or caufes which make it what it is, whether the thing be corporeal or not
;
as when we attempt to define the nature of a fluid, of a triangle, &c. oftentimes
we confound that which a man has by nature with what accrues to him by birth
;
as when we fay, that fuch a man is noble by nature. Sometimes we take nature
for an internal principle of motion ;
as when we fay, that a ftone by nature falls
to the ground. Sometimes we underftand by nature, the eftabliflied courfe and
order of things. Sometimes we take nature for an aggregate of powers belong-
ing to the fame body, efpecially a living one ;
in which fenfe phyficians fay, that
nature is ftrong, weak, or fpent ;
or that, in fuch and fuch difeafes, nature left

verfe, or whole fyftem of the corporeal works of God, as when it is faid of a

phoenix, or any imaginary being, that there is no fuch thing in nature. Some-
times too, and that not unfrequently, we exprefs by the word nature, a kind of
femi-deity, or fupernatural fpirit prefiding overall things.
This general abufe of the word nature, is by no means peculiar to the Eng-
lifh people or language ;
it prevails more or lefs in all countries, and amongft all
fe6ls ;
and feems to have been copied from the fabulous ideas of the ancients.
Ariflotle has written a whole chapter, exprefsly to enumerate the various accepta-
tions of the Greek word ^nS rendered in Englifh nature
;
and, among Latin wri-
ters, there are no lefs than fifteen or fixteen different acceptations of the fame
word, with advocates out of number for their interpretation. The bulk of them
infill, that the word nature radically means the fyflem of the world ; the machine
of the univerfe ;
or the affemblage of all created beings,; in which fenfe they fpeak
of the Author of Nature ;
and call the fun the eye of nature, becaufe he illuminates
the univerfe; and the father of nature, becaufe he warms the earth, and makes
it fruitful. Others, underftanding the word in a more confined fenfe, apply it to
each of the feveral kinds of beings, created and uncreated ;
fpiritual and corpo-
real ;
thus they fay divine nature, angelical nature, and human nature, meaning
all men together who poffefs the fame fpiritual reafonable foul. In this fenfe
the fchoolmen and divines fay, natura naturans, and natura naturata; fpeaking
of God, who is the natura naturans, as giving being and nature to all others ; in
oppofition or dillindlion to the creatures, who are the natura naturata, as receiv-
ing their nature from the hands of another.
Nature, in a flill more limited fenfe, is ufed for the eflfence of a thing; accord-
ing to which the Cartefians fay, it is the nature of the foul to think; and that the
nature of matter confifls in extenfion. Others more properly ufe the word Nature
for the eftablifhed order and courfe of material things ;
the feries of fecond caufes ;
or the laws which God has impofed on every part of the creation; in which fenfe
it is they fay, nature makes the night fucceed the day ;
nature has rendered refpira-
tion neceffary to life, &c. According to which, St. Thomas fpeaks of nature as a
kind of divine art, communicated to beings, which diredt and carry them to the ends
they were intended for; in which fenfe nature can be neither more or lefs than a
concatenation of caufes and effefls, or that order and ceconomy which God has efta-
blifhed in all parts of his creation. Others ftill more flri6lly confider nature as
the a6tion of Providence, and the principle of all things ;
or that fpiritual power or
being, which is diflufed throughout the creation, and moves and a£ts in all bodies,
and gives them peculiar properties, and produces peculiar effects. In this fenfe,
our modern philofopher Mr. Boyle confiders nature as nothing elfe but God,
acting
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. II
adting himfelf according to certain laws he himfelf has fixed. This correfponds
very much with the opinion of a fedt of ancient philofophers, who made Nature
the god of the univerfe, to n*v, whom they conceived to prefide over and govern
all things; but this they acknowledged to be only an imaginary being; and that
nature meant no more than the qualities, or virtues, which God implanted in his
creatures, but which their poets and orators had figuratively perfonified as a god.
Hence F. Malebranche was aggravated to fay, “that the nature fo much fpoken
of in the fchools, is only fit to lead us back to pagan idolatry ;
fince it taught us
to underfland fomething, which, without being God, adts continually throughout
the univerfe according to which, he fuppofes nature would be adored as an
idol, conceived to poffefs an adtual principle, which, in concurrence with God, was
the next and immediate caufe of all the changes which befal matter.
Ariflotle, with a view of concentrating thefe ideas of nature into one point, as
belt adapted to the wmrks of an infinitely-perfedt and all-pow'erful Being, defines
nature, principium et caufa motus et ejus in quo eji primo per fe, et non per acculens
;
which definition being miftaken by the Peripatetics and Stoics, they from hence
conceived the principle of nature to be a certain fpirit or virtue diffufed through-
out the univerfe, which gave every thing its motion by the invariable order of an
inevitable neceffity, without liberty or knowledge. This induced the idea of a
plajtic nature, which feveral learned modern w-riters have defcribed to be an in-
corporeal created fubftance, indued w-ith a vegetative life, but not with fenfation or
thought, penetrating the whole created univerfe, being co-extended w'ith it, and,
under God, moving matter fo as to produce the phenomena which cannot be foD
ved by mechanical laws ;
adtive for ends unknown to itfelf, not being confcious of
its own adtions, and yet having an obfcure idea of the adtion to be entered upon.
In fupport of this plajtic nature, Dr. Cudworth argues thus :
“ Since neither all things
are produced fortuitoufly, or by the unguided mechanifm of matter, nor God;
himfelf may reafonably be thought to do all things immediately and miraculoufly,
it may well be concluded, that there is a plajtic or formative nature under him,
which, as an inferior and fubordinatc inftrument, executes that part of his provi-
dence w'hieh confifts in the regular motion of matter; yet fo as that there is alfo,
befides this, a higher providence to be acknowledged, which, prefiding over it, doth
often fupply the defedts of it, and fometimes over rule it, forafmuch as this plaftic
nature cannot adt eledtively, nor with difcretion.” This dodtrine, he conceives,
had the fuffrage of the beft philofophers of all ages, Ariftotle, Plato, Empedo^
cles, Heraclitus, Hippocrates, Zeno, and the Stoics, and the latter Platonifts and
Peripatetics, as well as the chemifts and Paracelfians, and feveral modern writers.
. Now.
12 A KEY TO PHYSIC
Now I am clearly of opinion, that, notwithflanding thefe great authors have fo
obflinately contended for the definition of the word, and for the principles and
confti udtion of Nature, yet they all in reality meant one and the fame thing,
only giving different explanations of the fame ideas ;
and if their arguments are
clofely purfued, and compared with each other, they will all tend to fliow, that the
anima mundi, or foul of the univerfe, was wr
hat they meant by Nature.
This anima mundi, as we have before feen, is a medium invefling the whole inte-
rior heavens, and confifls of a pure ethereal fubflance, or fpirit: which, as it more
immediately refides in the celeftial regions, is the fecond or next caufe under God,
that moves and governs the heavens, and heavenly bodies, ftars, and planets
;
which bodies, having received their firfl exigence from the fecundity of the fame
fpirit in the a6t of creation, are by an influx of fympathetic rays, and by light,
heat, gravity, and motion, nourifhed and fuflained, upheld and continued, in the
fame regular courfe, and in the beautiful order we fee them. From the celeftial
regions, the fame influx of pure ethereal fpirit defcends into every part of the
immeafurable fpace, and is diffufed through the mafs of this world, informing,
adluating, and uniting the different parts thereof into various fubflances; and
being the primary fource of life, every-where breathing a fpirit like itfelf, it per-
vades all elementary bodies, and, intimately mixing with all the minute atoms
thereof, conflitutes the power or inftrument we call Nature, forming, fafhioning,
and propagating, all things, conformably to the ideas or will of the Divine Mind
in the firfl adt of creation. And fo the poet
:
Spiritus intus alit, totofque infufa per artus
Mens agitat molem, et magno fe corpore mifcet.
The only thing that has been objected to the notion of an anima mundi, is, that it
mingles the Deity too much with his creatures ;
confounds, in fome meafure, the
workman with his work, making this, as it were, a part of that, and the feveral
portions of the univerfe fo many parts of the Godhead.—Yet is the fame principle
afferted by Seneca, Epifl. 92. Totum hoc quo continemur,
et unum eji, et Deus. Etfocii
ejus fumus, et membra. M. du Hamel thinks, that thofe who deny it, objedt with-
out a reafon ;
of which every one will be fenfible, who reads the defcription above
given, fince it in no refpedt confound^ our comprehenfion of an infinitely-wife and
Supreme Being with that of the anima mundi; but, on the contrary, proves it to be
as diftindt from the Deity as are the angels and fpirits in heaven. And we may
further obferve, from what is above premifed, that thofe who deny the anima
mundi on one hand generally admit it on the other. Thus the Peripatetics
have
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES* 13
have recourfe to celeftial influxes, which is partly the fame thing, in order to ac-
count for the origin of forms, and the occult power of bodies. The Cartefians
have their fubtle matter, which anfwers to the a6tive fpirit of the anima mundi.
Others fuppofe an actuating fpirit to flow from the fun, and the other heavenly
bodies, which is diffufed over all parts of the world, and is the fource or principle
of life, motion, &c. which is ftill the fame thing. Some philofophers, in the placo
of thefe, have fubftituted the idea of fire, or an etherial elaftic fpirit, diffufed
through all parts of fpace, as the medium by which elementary bodies are nou-
rifhed and fuftained ;
which nearly comes to the fame thing. Even thofe who
have contended for a plcijiic nature, fall in with every principle of the anima mundi;
only they infift that the formative power is lodged in the earth; whereas the truth
is, that it dwells in the heavens, and is conveyed to the earth, to the elements, and
into all matter, by the medium I have defcribed.
I fliall conclude this definition of Nature, with remarking, agreeable to the
opinion of the ingenious Mr. Boyle, that, in order to regulate our conceptions of
the w ord in common, and to render the application of it lefs ambiguous, we fliould
diflinguifli between the univerfal and the particular nature of things. Univerfal
nature we fhould confider to be the aggregate of all the bodies that make up the
world* under the anima mundi, confidered as a principle by virtue whereof they a6t
and fuffer, according to the laws originally prefcribed by the Author of all things.
And this makes way for the other fubordinate notion; fmce the 'particular nature
of an individual confifls in the general nature, but only applied to that diftindl
part or portion of the univerfe; or, which is the fame thing, it is a particular af-
fernblage of the mechanical properties of matter, motion, &c. of thatfubjeft which
immediately engages our attention.
Of the VISIBLE and OCCULT PROPERTIES of NATURE.
HAVING thus far explained the foregoing fubje6t, we come next to an invef-
tigation of Caufes, and their Effects, or the means whereby Nature a6ts in the fruc-
tification of the univerfe. We derive the idea of caufes and effe6ts from our ob-
fervations of the viciffitudes of things, while we perceive fome qualities or fub-
ftances begin to exift, and that they receive their exigence from the due applica-
tion and operation of other beings ;
in all which circumftances, that which pro-
duces is the Caufe, and that which is produced is the Effe6t. There is fuch a rela-
tion and connexion between the caufe and the effect, that we cannot have a true
notion of the one, unlefs at the fame time we have a conception of the other.
So in general we fay that a caufe is nothing elfe but that which gives being to
*
No. 2. E another
H A KEY TO PHYSIC
another thing, which is the effeCt of it, which way foever it happens, according to
the various caufes.
The Firjt Caufe, which aCts of itfelf, and of its own fupreme power and will, is
God. This is a truth fo evident, and fo conlpicuous, that it cannot be denied. The
exigence of a Firft Cau fe may be deduced from the certainty of our own exiftence;
for that wp exift in the world, is a felf-evident truth ;
but that we came into it of
ourfelves, or by cafualtv, neceffity, or chance, isabfolutely impoftible. The fource
of our exiftence muft therefore be derived from fome being, who, as the author,
muft alfo be the free principle, of that eflence, or life, we poffefs. To fay that
we ourfelves were the caufe of our being, would be ridiculous; becaufe from thence
it would follow that we exifted before we had a being; that we gave ourfelves that
which we were not in the poffeffion of ;
and that the caufe and the effeCt were one
and the fame thing; which is likewife impoftible. It is no lefs an error to affirm
that we are in the world by neceffity ;
for, if fuch were the cafe, our exiftence would
have never had a beginning, and we ffiould have been immutable and independent,
and infinite in every kind of perfection; hut, as thefe qualities are only applicable
to a firft caufe, it follows that fuch caufe muft be Almighty.
Thofe who are convinced of the exiftence of a firft caufe, muft necefiarily attri-
bute to it all the perfections which are or can be in the world ; that it is not only
moft perfeCt, and molt noble, but alfo, that all the effeCts which it hath produced,
or is capable of producing, are contained within itfelf, in the utmoft perfection;
and that every one of them is infinite, in the unity of its being; for it is'neceffary it
ffiould poffefs the perfections of thofe beings it hath or can produce, otherwife it
would be faid to communicate that which it neither hath nor can have. The firft
caufe would not be abfolutely perfeCt, if it was not Eternal ;
for fo it would have
had a beginning, and might have an end ;
and then it could not have been the firft
caufe, infomuch as it derives its exiftence from that which w;
as pre-exifteot to it;
and by confequence this caufe, which we fuppofe to be the firft, would be a fe-
cond caufe, limited in its being and perfections, as in its duration; and it wmuld
feem to have a dependence upon another; whereas, when we fuppofe it to be the
firft, all others muft depend upon, and be fubordinate to, it. Whence it follows,
that thefe qualities muft be infeparable from it, independence, eternity, infinity,
and fupreme authority ;
andthat we cannot conceive any firft caufe, but at the
fame time we muft acknowledge the exiftence of God.
This JirJi caufe, which is God, muft necefiarily have that ‘perfett unity,
which ad-
mits no multiplication either of nature or perfections. Certainly if God was not
one in his being, but had feveral natures, the number of them ought to be infinite,
4 and
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 15
and yet none of thefe beings in particular would be infinite, becaufe, when the per-
fedtion of one cannot be the perfedtion of another, there will not be one to be found
but will (land in need of the other, that is, in whom there would not be requifitc
that perfection which the other beings poffefs. Therefore we may add, that all thefe
fuppofed beings would be oppofite, independent, and all fupreme, which is impof-
fible; or that all would be fubjedt to one or other of them, which is ridiculous^
whence it follows, that there is but one only God, who is one in his exigence, in-
capable of any multiplication, and who is the primary and univerfal caufe of all
things, The great number, or rather the infinity, of perfedlions which we appre-
hend to be in the firft caufe, is not repugnant to the Trinity, becaufe that does not
divide the being: and thefe perfedlions are but one and the fame thing, though we
give them feveral names, and confider them under feveral ideas, which we are forced
to corredl; finee without that unity there would be neeelfarily a compofition of
parts, which would be the materials of the whole compound, and would precede its
exiftence ;
therefore could not be the ingredients of that compofition, without fome-
thing elfe intervening. They may al-fo be divided and feparated; fo that, by the
dilfolution of the parts, the compound would ceafe ;
which is plainly inconfiftent
with that idea we have of God, who is not Ample in his nature, independent in his
, will, and every way incorruptible. The firft caufe is only one, and without its like,
in its efience, but alfo one foie, and without a fecond, in thatadlion by which this
world was produced; and for this reafon the adlion is called creation, fuppofing
nothing hut mere nothing, out of which all things were made, by the only power of
God, without the help of any other, having either the quality of an agent or a fub-
jedl. The world, being produced by this firft caufe, remains fubjedl to the will and
pleafure of it; and, in the fame manner as it was produced by the foie adl of this
firft caufe, fo it is preferved in the fame ftate, by the foie influence of the fame
caufe ;
which, as it did not want any help in the creation of the univerfe, fo neither
doth itftand in need of any affiftance in the confervation of it. If the firft caufe
was free in the creation of the world, thence it follows that all things were made
by diredtion of reafon and underftanding, and by eonfequence according to a cer-
tain idea and rule: and, finee the firft caufe operates after an independent manner,
it could not have the type of its produdlion any where elfe but from itfelf; neither
could it adt by a rule diftindt from its own being; fo that in truth God is not only
the firft, but the exemplary, caufe of all things. For the fame reafon it may be
faid, that the firft caufe, which isGod, is the final caufe of all things; for when he, as
an intelligent and free being, produced this world, he propofed to himfelf an end
anfwerable to his dignity, that is, to himfelf and his own proper glory. So that
>1 • the

the Firft Caufe is, neceffarily, the ultimate end of all its effe&s. This is a nice
fubje£t, wherein all preachers and writers feem at a lofs; but the cafe is clear and
beautiful to thofe who purfue the leffons of wifdom and fcience.
Second Caufes are thofe which derive the power or faculty of a6lin<rfrom the in-
fluence of the Firft Caufe. Hence the anima mundi is the feat of all fecond caufes,
which are alfo termed natural caufes, becaufe they have implanted in them, by the
Firft Caufe, the occult power of diffufmg through all fpace, and of communicating
to all bodies, that univerfal foul, or etherial fpirit, whereby every particle of matter
is moved, and made to a<5t upon one another, fo as to produce the various pheno-
mena in nature, in the animal, vegetable, and mineral, worlds; in the elements, and
in the firmament of heaven. This univerfal fpirit or caufe acts univerfally with
particular caufes; but after a manner agreeing with the nature of every particular
thing, and according to the power which was given it when it was created; which
neither alters the quality of the caufes, nor the neceffityor liberty of their actions.
This power of adting, which is communicated by fecond caufes, is not a quality
different from thofe things impowered to adl; whence the power which the atoms
have of moving in all dire6tions doth not differ from the atoms themfelves; the power
of burning or heating doth not differ from the fire to which it is inherent, unlefs
it be in the manner of our conceiving things, or of fpeaking of them according to
our conceptions. So it is of an a6lion which terminates from the caufe to the ef-
fe6I, and which is nothing elfe than a certain relation, or an a6tual fubordination,
which is always found betwixt the caufe and the effe6t. Hence we perceive that
fecond caufes are what all philofophers, ancient and modern, have contended for
under different forms ;
and are neither more nor lefs than that univerfal fpirit, or
inherent law, implanted in nature at the creation, whereby all God’s works are re-'
gulated and preferved, and the ends and purpofes of that creation conduced to
God’s glory and manifeftation, and to the good of all his creatures, the fludy of
which opens our eyes to the bright beams of true wifdom; to the mutual harmony
and dependence one thing has d^>on another ; to the fympathy and antipathy of
material bodies ;
to the perception^ of fenfe, reafon, and intelle&ual vifion ; to the
nice faculties and exquifite connexion of foul and body; and ultimately to the
knowledge of ourfelves, of our progrefs through this world; of our fublunary fate
and fortune ;
and of the things calculated to preferve life, or to deftroy it.
Efficient Caufes are all thofe actions of bodies or things, which are the agents or
direct means whereby any effe6ts are produced. Thus a painter, painting a picture,
is an efficient caufe ;
and the picture itfelf, when finifhed, is the effect thereof.
Efficient caufes comprehend a number of compound or fubordinate caufes, which
alfo
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 17
alfo contribute towards the production of their effedt. If the efficient caufe acts
by a power proper to itfelf, then it is called the principal caufe ; but, if only by the
force and {Length of another, then it is termed the inftrumental caufe. So we dif-
tinguifh between the painter and the pencil, though both contribute to the pro-
duction of the pidture. Again, the fubject whereon the agent works, or whereof
the thing is formed, is called the material caufe ;
thus the marble out of which a
ftatue is carved, is called the material caufe; as is likewife the paint and canvas of
a picture, as, being the matter, or materials, of which they are made; the fculptoi
and painter being the efficient caufes. There is alfo an efficient caufe in the fun,
moon, ftars, and elements, whereby they act upon fublunary matter, and produce a
variety of effects in the fructification and phenomena of this world. From thefe
arife neceffary and free caufes : the firffof which a6t neceffarily and without choice ;
as fire, the fun, and all created beings, except angels and men ; for they act by a free
will, wherein confifts the effence of liberty. The efficient caufe is likewife either
phyfical, or moral; the phyfical is that which produces a fenfible corporeal effect,
and acts obvioufly and immediately ;
thus fire is the phyfical caufe of burning, and
the fun the phyfical caufe of heat. The moral caufe alfo produces a real effect, but
in things immaterial ;
thus* repentance is the moral caufe of forgivenefs. Again,
we define a ‘phyfical caufe to be that which produces its effect by a phyfical virtue;
and a moral caufe, that which determines the phyfical caufe, though not neceffarily.
to produce the effect: thus, the fun is the phyfical caufe of light; a ftone that falls
from an eminence, and fractures the fkull, is a phyfical caufe of death; and thus
the advice, intreaty, commands, or menaces, which determine us, though not ne-
ceffarily, to do, or not to do, any thing, are moral caufes. In this fen fe it is obvious
a moral caufe is only applicable to a free intelligent agent ;
and it is this notion of
a moral and phyfical caufe that is the moft juft, clear, and diftindt.
Whenever the efficient caufe applies to a free intelligent being, and adts from
knowledge, all the fubordinate caufes concur to theprodudtion of one and the fame
effedt; as for example, the painter drawing his pidture is the principal caufe; the
pencil the inftrumental ;
the end propofed by the painter is the final caufe ;
the idea
diredting the performance is the exemplary caufe ;
the form and difpofition of its
parts is the formal caufe; the colours and the canvas are the material caufe, as being
the conftituent matter of the work; and if the artift, by any accidental touch, im^
proves his pidture, like Agillaus, who labouring many days to draw a foaming horfe,
and could not, in a paftion flung his brufh at the painting, and the thing he wanted
was thus accompliflied when it was not intended—it is termed an accidental caufe,
So that we fee all fubordinate caufes are in effedt under the efficient caufe; and
are fubfervient to it, when applied by reafon, and diredted by {kill.
No. 9., E Form
IS A KEY TO PHYSIC
Form and formal caufe is one and the fame thing; and, when we fay there are
two forts of forms, that is only according to our manner of conceiving things; fo
we fay there are two forts of formal caufes, the fubflantial and accidental. But all
forms are imaginary; neither do true philofophers acknowledge any other fubflance
to be in natural compounds than matter, except only in man ;
nor any other form
than the difpofition of the parts, becaufe all thefe forms are altogether ufelefs.
Moreover, the exemplary caufe may be referred to the formal, becaufe it is the
idea and inward form of that which w-e frame in our fpirit ; fo the formal caufe of
a pifture is the difpofition of its parts, according to the difpofition and ordination
which it then had in the mind of the painter. The fame may be faid of all rational
agents which are endued with underftanding.
There is no difference betwixt matter and a material caufe ;
and there are two
forts of material caufes, as well as of matter. That is the firft matter out of which
all bodies are compofed, and into which, by an univerfal divifion, they may be re-
duced ;
the fecond is nothing elfe but bodies made of the firft, and upon which the
efficient caufes exercife their a6tion. Therefore it is apparent, that there is nothing
in the world but what is a compound, and that there is no compound without mat-
ter. It is alfo certain that there is nothing made without an efficient caufe, which
a<5ts upon compounds, and deftroys them, that of them others may be made; becaufe
the matter of the firft ferves for the compofition of the fecond. The matter which
goes to the compofition of the firft and fecond is \hefirft matter, or material caufe,
of the compound ;
and that matter which ferves the efficient caufe for a fubjeft and
patient is called the fecond matter. Both of them may be an efficient caufe ; for
compounds a£t upon one another like the elements, which drive one another back-
wards and forwards. That which drives another is called the agent, as that which
is driven is called the patient ;
and if there be any thing which refills it, and drives
back another, this regrefs of the motion is called re-attion. So that one and the
fame thing may be the fubje6t and caufe of motion ;
and that, to give and receive
being the principle of agent and patient, both may happen at the fame time, but
in divers refpe6ls. ,
'
Efficient caufes, in folid and fluid bodies, we often fee, a6l in a moft wonderful
manner; and, if they were not vifible to our eyes, we fhould fcarcely believe any.of
thefe occult properties exifted in them. Thus, the a6lion of oil, in flopping the
violent ebullition of various fubftances, is truly furprifing. It is well known, that if a
mixture of fugar, honey, or the like, be boiling on the fire, and in danger of rifing
over the fides of the vefiel, the pouring in a little oil immediately makes it fubfide.
In many cafes the marking a circle round the infide of a veffel, in which a liquor of
2 this
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 19
this kind is to be boiled, with a piece of hard foap, fhall, like a magic ring, confine
the ebullition to that height, and not fuffer it to ftir any farther. This is wholly
owing totheoil, or fat, contained in the foap: but there is, befides thefe, anothervery
important ufe of oil, on a like occafion, which is the pouring a little of it on any me-
tallic folution while making ;
this reftrains the afcent of the noxious vapours ;
pre-
ferves the operator from danger; and, at the fame time, by keeping down the evapo-
rating matter, gives redoubled ftrength to the menftruum. Pliny has mentioned an
extraordinary efFe6t of oil, in Hilling the furface of water when it is agitated with
waves, and the ufe made of it, by the divers, for this purpofe : Omne, fays he, oleo
tranquillari, «§y?. lib. ii. cap. 103. And Plutarch, in Quasft. Natur. afks, Cur mare
oleo confperfumper lucidumfitet tranquillum
?
Pliny’s account feems to have been
either difcredited or difregardedby our writers on experimental philofophy, tillitwas
confirmed by feveral curious experiments of Dr. Franklin, which were publifhed in
the year 1774. The property of oil above mentioned has, however, been well known
to modern divers and dredgers for oyfters at Gibraltar, and elfewhere. The divers in
the Mediterranean, in particular, defcend, as in Pliny’s time, with a little oil in their
mouths, which they now and then let out ;
and which, on riling to the furface of the
fea, immediately renders it fmooth, fo as to permit the light to pafs through the wa-
ter undifturbed by various aild irregular refradtions. The Bermudans are enabled
to fee and ftrike filh, which would be concealed from their view through the
roughnefs of the fea, by pouring a little oil upon it. And the Lifbon fifhermen ef-
fe6t a fafe paffage over the bar of the Tagus, by emptying a bottle or two of oil into
the fea, when the furf is fo great as to endanger its filling their boats. Our failors
have alfo obferved, that the water is always much fmoother in the wake of a fhip that
hath been newly tallowed than it is in one that is foul. Dr. Franklin was led, by
an accidental obfervation made at fea in 1757, to attend particularly to Pliny’s ac-
count ;
and the various informations which he afterwards received relating to it in-
duced him to try fome experiments on the fubjeft. Standing on the windward fide
of a large pond, the furface of which was rendered very rough with the wind, he
poured atea-fpoonful of oil on the water. This fmall quantity produced an inftanfc
calm over a fpace of feveral yards fquare, which fpread amazingly, and extended it-
felf gradually, till it reached the lee fide, making all that quarter of the pond, per-
haps half an acre, as fmooth as a looking-glafs. On repeating this experiment,
which conftantly fucceeded, one circumftance ftruck him with particular furprife ;
this was the fudden, wide, and forcible, l'preading of a drop ol" oil on the face of the
water, which, he adds, “ I do not know that any body has confidered.” When a
drop of oil is put on a looking-glafs, or polifhed marble, itfpreads very little; but

on water it inftantly expands into a circle extending feveral feet in diameter, becom-
ing fo thin as to produce the prifmatic colours for a confiderable fpace, and beyond
them fo much thinner as to beinvifible, except in its effe6ts of ftnoothing the waves
at a much greater diftance. It feems, fays Dr. Franklin, as if a mutual repulfion
between its particles took place as foon as it touched the water, and a repulfion fo
ftrong as to a6t on other bodies fwimming on the furface, as ftraws, leaves, &c.
forcing them to recede every way from the drop, as from a centre, leaving a large
clear fpace. In endeavouring to account for the Angular effefts of oil, Dr. Franks
lin obferves, that there feems to be no natural repulfion between w ater and air, fueh
as to keep them from corning into conta6l with each other.—Therefore, air in mo-
tion, which is wind, in paffing over the frnooth furface of water, may rub, as it were,
on that furface, and raife it into wrinkles, which, if the wind continues, are the ele-
ments of future waves. The fmalleft W'ave does not immediately fubfide, but in
fubfiding raifes nearly as much of the water next to it. A fmall power, continually
operating, will produce a great adtiort : fo that the firft-raifed waves* being continu-
ally a6ted upon by the wind, are, though the wind does not increafe in ftrength,
continually increafed in magnitude, rifing higher and extending their bafes, fo as to
include a vaft mafs of water in each wave, which, in its motion, a<5ts with great vio-
lence. But, if there be a mutual repulfion between the particles of oil* and no at-
tra6lion between oil and water, oil dropt on water will not beheld together by ad-
hefion to the fpot on which it falls : it will not be imbibed by the water, but be at
liberty to expand itfelf and fpread on a furface, that prevents, perhaps, by repelling
the oil, all immediate contaft; the expanfion will continue till the mutual repulfion
between the particles of oil is weakened, and reduced to nothing by their diftance.
Dr. Franklin imagines, that the wind, blowing over water thus* covered with
a film of oil, cannot eafily catch upon it, fo as to raife the firft wrinkles, but Aides
over it, and leaves it fmooth as it finds it. It moves a little the oil, indeed, which,
being between it and the water, ferves it to Aide with, and prevents friction : hence
the oil, dropt on the windward fide of the pond, proceeds gradually to leewT
ard, as
may be feen by the fmoothnefs it carries with it quite to the oppofite fide ; for the
wind, being thus prevented from railing the firft wrinkles* which he calls the ele-
ments of waves, cannot produce waves, which are to be made by continually a6ting
upon and enlarging thofe elements; and thus the whole pond is calmed. Upon the
whole, there is great room to fuppofe (notwithftanding the partial failure of an ex-
periment made at Portfmouth by Dr. Franklin and others), that feafaring people
may derive advantages from ufing oil on particular occafions, in order to moderate
die violence of the waves, or to leften the furf which fometimes renders the landing

en a lee-fhore dangerous or impra&icable. To this purpofe we are iinformed, that
the captain of a Dutch Eaftlndia Chip, being overtaken byaftorm, found himfelf
obliged, for greater fafety in wearing the fhip, to pour oil into the fea, to prevent
the waves breaking over her; which had an excellent effe6l, and fucceeded in prefer-
ving her. Phil. Tranf. vol. lxiv. part 2. p. 445, &c. It is alfo obfervable, on
the coaft of Sutherland, when the lump-fiffi abounds in fpring, and are devoured by
the feals, that it may be known by the fmoothnefs of the water above the fpot; the
oil ferving to (till the agitation of the waves.
Occajional caufe is applied to the foul and body of man, and are only the occafions,
not the direct caufes, of their effe6ts. The foul is not able to a6t on the body, nor
the body reciprocally on the foul : to keep up an intercourfe between them, God,
on occafion of a motion of the body, impreffes a fen fation on the foul ;
and, on occa-
fion of a fentiment of the foul, impreffes a motion on the body : the motions, therefore,
of the foul and body, are only occajional caufes of what paffes in the one or the
other. Thus, we fay, the flroke, or percuffion, is only the occafional caufe of the
motion produced in the body ftruck; it is God is the dire6t efficient caufe. And
thus the adlion of objects on our organs is not the efficient caufe of our ideas and
perceptions, but merely the occafional caufe, which determines God toadlon the
mind, according to the laws of the union of foul and body.
In a medicalfenfe, w hatever produces a difeafe is called the caufe thereof. This
operates either by inducing a new ftate of the folids and fluids, or by taking away
fomething which is abfolutely requifite to the exercifeof fome fun6tion. If a caufe
pre-exifted in fome meafure in the body before the effedt produced, it is called an
internal caufe ;
but if it exifted out of the body, and by its application to it produced
the difeafe, it is called external.
Internal caufes generally injure firft the humours, and then the folid parts
;
whereas, the external caufes affe6t the folids, and, in confequence of that, the hu-
mours ;
and this holds univerfally, unlefs perhaps in fome few difeafes produced by
poifon or contagion. The immediate caufe is that which taken altogether immedi-
ately conflitutes the prefent difeafe ;
this is always adequate, and fufficient to the
formation of the difeafe, whether fimple or complicated. The prefence of this con-
ftitutes and continues the difeafe : and the abfence of it removes the diforder, being
very little different from the difeafe itfelf. The inveftigation, therefore, of this is ex-
tremely ufeful and very neceffarv. The remote caufe is that which changes the body
in fuch a manner, as to difpofe it for the reception of a difeafe upon the accelfion of
another caufe; but it is never adequate or fufficient to produce a difeafe alone; nor
would that other caufe, the accceffion of which is neceffary, be of itfelf fufficient for

the produ&ion ofthe difeafe; biit both muft concur. The bufinefsof phyfic, there-
fore, is to eradicate both together, which, in conjunction, conftitute the proximate
or immediate caufe. The remote caufe inherent in the body, is called preuifponent,
antecedent, and by the Greeks v{onx°vi*r>*, and confifts principally in temperaments,
plethora, and cacochymy. The caufe whofe acceffion to the remote caufe excites,
and in conjunction with it forms, the difeafe, is called the procatarCtic caufe, or the
rgoQa,o-k, or occafion of the difeafe. It is fometimes internal, fometimes external.
Thefe Boerhaave reduces to four clalfes. Firft, the ingejia,
or tilings entering the
body ;
fuch as the air, aliments, drink, medicines, poifons, fuch things as enter
by the pores of the (kin and noftrils ; by the feveral paffages of the mouth, lungs,
oefophagus, ftomach, inteftines, &c. either in a vifible or invifible manner; whether
by fleam, draught, deglutition, clyfler, or injedtion. Secondly, the gejia, or things
adted, as motion of the whole or any part of the body, affedtions of the mind, reft,
both of the body and mind, fleeping and watching. Thirdly, things retained, or
excreted, whether falubrious, fecrementious, or morbid. Fourthly, things applied
to the body ;
as air, vapours, fomentations, cloths, liniments, ointments, and
plafters; together with whatever wounds, contufes, or corrodes : all which cir-
cumftances fhould be well confidered by medical men.
Of the FIRST MATTER.
ALL philofophers agree that there is a firji matter,
which was produced from the
beginning ;
and, though it can never undergo any change, yet it is to be feen in all
the generations and corruptions which are in naturei Hence it appears, that the
firft matter exifted before the generation of the compounds wherein it is found, and
that it ftill remains and furvives the corruption ofit ;
as, for inftance, in fire which is
made of chips; the matter of the fire was in the chips, and is found partly in the
fire, partly in the fmoke, and partly alfo in the afhes. It is agreed by all, that no-
thing produces nothing, and that there is not any thing in nature that can be redu*
ced into nothing, but that the firft principles remain in all revolutions which can
happen ;
therefore, in refpedfc of matter, we may juftly fay, that there is nothing
new in the world fince the creation, and that this matter in its nature is incorrupti-
ble; fo that to explain the effence of this firft matter is the only difficulty.—Ariftotle
makes it the fubjedt of all forms, and nothing but a paflive power or a mere capacity
of producing them. He fays alfo, that matter in itfelf hath neither quality nor quan-
tity, nor any effence befides that which it received from that form which perfected it
:
but this explication gives us no clear idea of matter, neither doth it teach us any
thing of the nature of it. Thofe were nearer the truth who faid that the firft matter
was
23
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES.
was nothing elfe but the firft elements into whicu Compounds by a total diffolution
are reduced ;
alfo that thefe elements ought to be fimple and indivifible, for other-
wife the firft elements are not fuch as we fuppofe them to be. It follows from this
do6trine, that neither water, air, earth, nor fire, are firft elements, becaufe they
are compounds, as by the new chemiftry is evidently proved ;
therefore, we muft
look for other elements which are fimple and indivifible. Now, it is obvious, that
fimple and indivifible atoms are the only firft matter, and the principle and elements
whereof bodies are compofed : out of thefe atoms are corpufcles made, out of
thefe corpufcles fmall mafies, out of maffes greater parts, and of thefe parts
greater bodies, whereof the univerfe itfelf conlifts. And vice verfa, going back-
ward analytically, the world is divided into great bodies, thofe bodies are reduced
by mortality and time into parts, parts into fmall maffes, mafies into corpufcles,
and, laftly, corpufcles into atoms.
Of ATOMS, aw© their NATURE.
TO demonftrate the exiftence of atoms, we may fuppofe that every compound
may be divided into fo many parts as they are which make the compound; and di-
vifion nuift neceffarily ceafe when there is a failure of parts to be divided. On
the other hand, there is no end of divifion as long as there are particles to be di-
vided ;
for we muft allow, either that a body cannot be fo exa&ly divided but
that there always remain divifible parts in infinitum, or that there are parts after a
certain number of divifions which will not admit any further divifions. Ariftotle holds
the former, but Gaffendus and the ancient philofophers defend the latter; and, ac-
cording to this laft dodtriue, after all the divifions are made, nothing can remain be-
fides atoms, that is, indivifible beings, which are the firft elements of natural bodies.
I confefs it is hard to imagine a corporeal thing to lie indivifible, becaufe we fee no-
thing in this world w hich is not divifible ; but this makes nothing againft atoms which
are corporeal, becaufe they compofe bodies, and are indivifible, becaufe they are the
fii ft and moft fimple elements of bodies. Hence arifes another difficulty, becaufe it
cannot be eafily explained after what manneFa thing that is divifiole is compofed of
parts which are indivifible. Impartial minds do not find fo much difficulty ineonceiv-
ing this matter, as thofe do who follow the prejudices they have received ; fome
people do not confider, firft, that there are many things which efcape our fenfes, and
yet are moft real ;
fecondly, that which compofes a body is not a compound, as
we fee that unity makes number, though itfelf be not a number; letters, whereof
nouns and words are framed, yet are neither one or the other; the drops of water,
whereof rivers confift, are not rivers ; fo atoms, though they are invifible and indi-
vifible
24 A KEY TO PHYSIC
vifible, yet they compofe bodies"which are vifible and divifible. They are alfo
immutable, in order to the world's continuing in the fame Hate, and bodies being
of the lame nature now as formerly.
Of the PROPERTIES, MAGNITUDE, FIGURE, WEIGHT, and
MOTION, of ATOMS.
AN atom is a corporeal being, fimple, invilible, and indivifible; folidity confti-
tutes its elfence or elfential property, which jdiitinguilhes it from fpiritand vacuity,
which hath no power of refilling. Atoms necelfarily avoid ail our fenfes, becaufe
they are compofed of many diftin6l and grofs parts, whofe obje6l ought to be com-
poled ere it can be perceived by the external organ ;
this, however, does notdeftroy
|
the truth and reality of atoms, becaufe fmall corpufcles efcape our fenfes ;
as we
obferve in dull, which fticks to our clothes ;
in the corpufcles of a ftone, which
is made hollow by drops of water; in divers occult parts in a mite, which cannot
be feen without the help of amicrofcope ; and, lallly, in fmall corpufcles which
are feen to move in a chamber by the fun-beams : we may omit many others that
are fmaller, which, without doubt, we could fee if our fight were more acute.
Though atoms are moll fubtle and imperceptible, yet they have their particular
.extenfion, magnitude, and figure, from w hence their differences arife: for the figure
of fomeof them is round, as the atoms of w ater, oil, and quickfilver; others have
cubicular figures, fuch as the atoms of fea-water; and others are pyramidal, as thofe
whereof nitre confills; . there are fome which have lharp points like needles, as thofe
of fire ;
whence we have to fuppofe there are others varioully figured. This difference
is necelfary to dillinguifh compounds : and as thefe atoms, as to their folidity or in-
vifibility and indivifibility, (which are their infeparable properties,) are alike, fo
alfo, if they did not differ in their figure and thicknefs, all bodies would be alike.
Weight is the principle of the faid natural motion, inafmuch as it doth refill a
violent motion. I mention this, that we may know whether motion in atoms hath
an internal or external principle, or whether weight be determined only to one
motion, or that it be indifferently inclined to many ; and whether the motion of
atoms doth tend to fome centre; and whether it be continuant or interrupted,
and, lallly, whether it be perpendicular or horizontal, parallel or declined, right,
or parabolical, or circular.
In order to folvethis difficulty, I fuppofe that atoms may be confidered in a double
Hate: the firll ftate is before the compolition of the bodies which are made of them,
and may be called the Hate of liberty; the other, is that which they have in the bodies
which confill of them, which may be termed the ftate of obligation or fervitude.
4 If
25
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES.
If atoms be confidered in their fird date, flfitgir motion is perpetual ;
fo that an
atom that is loofe, and freed from any compofition, is edentially in motion, which
ought not in the lead to be wondered at ;
for motion in refpeft of a free atom is the
fame that underdanding is in refpedt of an angel, which is never without knowing,
unlefs his intelledt be bound and clouded.
From this principle it is evident, that atoms are in continual motion, unlefs
they are hindered, or mat they meet with fome obdru&ion, or that there are other
atoms redding or repelling them, or that they find fuch as will dick to them, or that
they infinuate themfelves into the atoms of certain bodies, or that they enter into
fome compofition whereby their motion is ftopped. Neverthelefs, atoms in com-
pounds are not altogether void of motion, becaufe they are not fo draitly embo-
died together but that they have fome motion, like vibrations and palpitations, ac-
cording to the liberty which is granted them by the dilfeminated vacuities ;
nay,
fome of them do fometimes attempt their efcape, efpecially in porous bodies, which
therefore fooner corrupt and perilh than bodies which are more folid and clofe.
It is yet more evident in living bodies, out of which the animal fpirits, which are
but the bodies of atoms, and mod fubtle corpufcles, are didipated by tranfpiration,
whence aliment is neceffarily requifite to fupply to the whole body thofe fpirits
which are didipated by motion and agitation. This motion of atoms, or the
lead corpufcles, in living bodies, may be defervedly accounted the image of their
fird liberty; and, though they do but feldom enjoy their full liberty, yet they are
apt to raife the greateft commotions in order to be freed, and to gain their liberty.
This is the origin of many diftempers ; as, in acute fevers, the atoms or corpufcles
of the boiling blood, orobdrudted choler, are carried and driven into thebrain, where
they produce watchfulnefs, deliriums, and phrenfies. According to this principle,
that which we laid before may be concluded, That many di/tempers arifefrom mi-
nute corpufcles and emancipated atoms
;
for thefe, being driven forwards by other
atoms, and forced back, run into the membranes, periodium, meninges, or intef-
tines, and caufe the cholic, head-ach, gout, and rheumatifm ;
fo that this folution
of corpufcles and emancipation of atoms in our bodies is much to be dreaded ;
and,
to prevent their danger, all motions of the body which are too violent mud be
avoided ;
for thefe are the external caufe of the condition of the fpirits and the
emancipation of the atoms.
The emancipation of the atoms, and alfo of thefmall corpufcles which arecom-
pofed of thofe atoms, are to be feen no lefs in the great world than in the little
:
for the winds are nothing lefs than emancipated atoms, which, by their impetuofity
being driven backwards and forwards, force all bodies that dand in their way :
No. 2. H it
S6 ,Y TO PHYSIC
it is thefe atoms which agittSffipr, and overturn all things which refill their mo-
tion; therefore the motion of atoffis is not equal, nor every where alike, but varies
according to the diverfity of bodies whereby they are driven, or as the figures of
them are more or lefs fitted for motion, or otherwife, according to the proportion
of vacuities which are difperfed in bodies ;
fo that fome atoms are moved quicker,
and others flower, not becaufe fome are heavier than others, but becaufe they are
driven backwards or forwards, or are flopped, by others which happen to fix
them with greater or lefs violence.
An atom is not a body according to the notion we have, that it is a compound
being ;
but a Ample being, and alfo corporeal ; that is, Ample, becaufe it is indiviA-
ble; and corporeal, becaufe it hath a certain extenfion, and makes up the compofi-
tion of bodies, which in the total diviAon of them are reduced again into atoms.
Two other difficulties arife from the former opinion : for, if an atom be indiviAble,
after what manner can we propofe to ourfelves that it hath extenfion, or how can
it be an ingredient in the compofition of divifible bodies ? To this we anfwer in
few words, that extenfion is according to the nature of the thing extended ; for, if
the thing extended be divifible, in the fame manner is the extenfion ; and fo, on
the other fide, it is of the rational foul, which is pofiefled of the whole body, and ex-
ercifes its operations in all the parts of it; neverthelefs it is, like an atom, indivifi-
ble ; and, though it be divifible in refpeft of the fpace it occupies, yet it hath an in-
ternal extenfion which is indiviAble ;
it is the fame thing which divines are forced to
fay of angels, and fome philofophers about their phyfical tumid points. But fome
will fay, that atoms are neither like fouls, angels, nor phyfical points, becaufe they
have parts, and thefe have none ;
and fince that which confifts of parts is divifible, it
follows alfo that an atom is divifible. To this difficulty I anfwer, with the divines,
that angels and our fouls, which are fpirits—and alfo, with philofophers, that phy-
fical points, which are material—have no real but only potential parts ;
that is, an
angel and rational foul in refpedl of the operations which they exercife and the fpace
which they occupy, and the tumid points in refpeft of the fpace which they fill up.
Indeed, an angel and the foul have two powers, whereof the one is the intellect, the
other the will, which, being only an indivifible fubftance, capable of underftanding
and willing, yet no man will deny but they, notwithftanding their indivifibility,
(which at leaft is equal to the indivifibility of an atom,) do fill up a divifible fpace;
as no man can doubt but that an angel can be at the fame time in the four corners
of the room and in the middle of it, and that it hath a four-fquare figure by com-
munication of the four angles or corners, and that it can quit this and aflume another
figure at its pleafure ;
which cannot be faid of tumid points and atoms, which are
7 deftitute
27
AND THE OCCULT^ SCIE
deftitute of underftanding and will. The ratio^jg^p^being equally indivifible
with an atom, angel, or point, doth wholly poffefs a great body, no lefs than it did
when the body was little; therefore it dilates itfelf without being divided, becaufe
in its nature it is fimple and indivilible, and is without diftindt parts. This is the
opinion of Ariftotle, and indeed it is the mod common opinion. But, if the foul
were not by its own fubftance extended through the whole body, and had its feat
onlv in the heart, as Empedocles would have it ;
or in the fpleen and the ftomach,
as Van Helmont places it; or in the glcinclula pinealis of the brain, according to
Cartefius ;
or in the ftriate bodies of the brain where the common fenfe is, or the
fenfe itfelf, as it is called by w'ay of excellency ;
and in the callous parts, becaufe
there it forms the ideas of things and judges of them ;
and in the cineritious part
of the brain, becaufe there it performs the functions of the memory, according to
the opinion of Duncan—it is certain that all thefe parts, which are taken to be
the feat of the foul, are divifible, and that thay have diftindt parts and figures :
fo the foul, as it is indivifible, occupies a fpace or place w hich isdivifible ;
whence
I conclude, that indivifibility does not hinder but that a fubftance may have a
certain indivifible extenfion, but divifible as to the place which it poffeffes, or
that it may have angles and figure in refpedt of place, though its fubftance effen-
tially remain one, fimple, and indivifible^
Hence it follows that there is One catholic or univerfal matter, called corpuf-
cles or atoms, filling all fpace, which is an extended, impenetrable, and divifible,
fubftance, common to all bodies, and capable of all forms; infinitely harder than any
of the fenfible porous bodies compounded of them; even fo hard, as never to wear,
or break in pieces ;
no other power being able to divide what God made one in the
firft creation. While thefe corpufcles remain entire, they may compofe bodies of
one and the fame nature and texture in all ages ;
but, fhould they wear away or
break in pieces, the nature of things depending on them would be changed. Wa-
ter and earth, compofed of old worn particles and fragments of particles, would not
be of the fame nature and texture now w ith water and earth compofed of entire par-
ticles at the beginning; and therefore, that nature may be lafting, the changes of
corporeal things are only to be placed in the various feparations and new affociations
of thefe permanent corpufcles ;
that, in order to form the vafi variety of natural
bodies, this matter muft have motion in all its affignable parts, and a6t in all man-
ner of dire6tions and tendencies. Thefe corpufcles have therefore not only a vis
inertia, accompanied with fuch paffive laws of motion as naturally refult from that
force ;
but alfo are moved by certain active principles, fuch as that of gravity, and
that which caufes fermentation, and the cohefion and fympathy of bodies. That

d into parts, and each of thefe primitive par-
ticles, fragments, or atoms of matter, muft have their proper magnitude, figure,
and fiiape; and muft hhve different orders, pofitions, fituations, and poftures,
whence all the varieties of compound bodies arife.
*
This view of the firft: principles
of matter accounts for an infinity of phenomena, otherwife inexplicable; and
points out all the occult operations in nature, by fympathy, antipathy, fafcination,
cohefion, coagulation, diffolution, &c. for, fince thefe corpufcles are every-where
and at all times in motion, ilfuing from and cohering to all bodies that fall in their
way ;
and fince they are operated upon and diverfly altered by the four elements
proper to this world ; and thefe elements again by rays of light, heat, and influx of
theanima mundi, and celeftial bodies —all the viciffitudes of nature are deduced
from them; and, according to the>qualities and temperature of the matter fo formed,
and of thofe they come in contact with, are the affedfions of the mind, the fun&ions
of the body, the paflion of love, and a thoufand inexplicable circumftances attend-
ant on human affairs, regulated and governed; as we fhall now proceed to fhow.
.
Of SYMPATHY and ANTIPATHY in NATURAL BODIES.
THE wonderful effedls we fee in nature, whofe true and efficient caufes are not
eafily found out, obliged philofophers heretofore to have recourfe to occult caufes,
and to attribute all thofe effects to natural fympathy and antipathy, which happen
amongft the feveral bodies whereof the world is compounded.
That we may the better underftand what may be faid upon a fubjedf fo nice and
delicate, and give a reafon for thofe wonderful effects which are attributed to fympa-
thy and antipathy, -jn the firft place we muft fuppofe, that the difficulty which oc-
t
curs in explaining an effe6t of this nature, is becaufe the mind is not able to know
the truth of things but by the fenfes, which are the gates through which the objects
enter, and form their ideas in our underftanding; but, becaufe there are an abun-
dance of things that efcape our fenfes, it is no wonder that it is fo hard to give a
reafon for thofe caufes which are fo remote from our view : as for example, iron
moves itfelf, and that by way of local motion, and joins itfelf to the loadftone; we
do not fee that which draws the iron to it, though we fee it attra&ed; and therefore,
that we may give a folid reafon for this and other phenomena of the like nature, we
declare, according to our philofophy, that there are no bodies but what continually
emit certain l’ubtle particles and imperceptible corpufcles which are difperfed through
the air, and are fometimes carried to a great diftance, unlefs they are furrounded
by other bodies in their way. By this principle we find the reafon why a dog follows
the

the footftep of the hare, or from a heap of a thoufand ftones, he readily knows the
ftone his mafter threw, and picks it out, and by his command brings it to him ;
from
this difperfion of corpufcles, we find the reafon how the contagion of the plague,
either from the perfon infedted, or from the wind blowing from that region, is car-
ried a great way off ;
by this appears the reafon why wounds may be cured at a
hundred miles diftance by means of the fympathetic powder, the aftoniihing proper-
ties of which are fully defcribed in my Illuftration of the Occult Sciences ;
fo like-
wife of the fermentation of Canary wine brought into England, which ferments
here at the fame time of the vintage there.
-
We muft luppofe, farther, that thefe fmall corpufcles differ in figure and magni-
tude, and are not equally received by this or that body ;
fo one man is infected by
the plague in the fame place where many others efcape ;
for the fame reafon the
beams of the fun melt wax, but not lead unlefs they are collected and united by the
help of a burning lens, or the like ; and the heat of fire melts metals in a very dif-
ferent manner.
Again, the palm-tree of the male kind is barren unlefs the female be planted near

and, if feparated by a river, they lean to each other as if they would embrace

the cock always crows and claps his wings in the fame moment the fun af-
cends the horizon. All effects which we fee from lympathy afford us matter of
admiration ;
but the loadftone demonftrates the affinity of corpufcles more palpably
to our fenfes than moft other experiments. The loadftone is found in iron-mines,
and is not much different from the nature of iron ; wherefore the particles which
proceed from the loadftone have a kind of agreement with the pores of iron ;
and
thefe fmall corpufcles, going out of the loadftone, and meeting with the iron in the
way, rufh into the pores of it ;
but, becaufe all cannot enter at once, a great many re-
main without, and thefe are as ftrongly beaten back by the particles of the iron which
they meet with, as if they were of the number of thofe corpufcles, which, being at li-
berty, return of their own accord, and at length fend thefe by a refleaive motion to
the loadftone, from whence they firft came. Hence it is that the iron is drawn towards
the loadftone, principally by the agitation of thofe minute magnetic corpufcles moved
in the concavities of the iron ;
and, being lhaken together by the fundry motion of
thofe corpufcles which are twitted one within another, thofe corpufcles which return
by refletftion are complicated and annexed to thofe which are in the pores of the
iron, and cannot be returned or moved towards the loadftone, unlefs they draw
along with them thole corpufcles to which they are annexed, and which cannot fol-

low unlefs by their motion the iron be carried with them ;
fo the iron follows and is
moved toward the loadftone, except the iron be bigger than the loadftone ;
for then
the corpufcles which proceed from the loadftone are not fo many, nor by confequence
fo powerful, as to draw the iron. The reafon the loadftone draws no other body but
iron, is becaufe other bodies dp not return the atoms, neither are their pores well
fitted for thofe magnetic corpufcles. By the fame reafon it appears, that the load-
ftone does not approach to the iron, but the iron to the loadftone. It may be faid
that hard and lolid bodies, fuch as iron, cannot emit fuch a great number of corpuf-
cles as other bodies, which, like the loadftone, are lefs folid and more porous.
There may be a reafon given alfo why the loadftone, being rubbed with garlic or
oil, does not fo eafily draw iron to it ;
w’hich is, that thefe ftrange corpufcles, by
their oilinefs, hinder the emiffion of the corpufcles out of the loadftone, and alfo
their entrance into the pores of the iron, and thus break their elaftic force.
We may obferve many other effects of the loadftone : as for example, that ir'on put
upon a table is moved by the virtue of this ftone placed under the table; for it is
certain that the corpufcles of the loadftone which moves the iron penetrate through
the vacuity or pores of the table, as if by fmall and invifible threads it had been tied
to the loadftone. It is the fame thing if the table be of marble or glafs, provided it
be not greafy nor too thick ;
which proves the porofity of bodies in general. An-
other effect of the loadftone is feen in a needle, which, being touched by it, always
turns towards the north pole ;
the reafon is, becaufe there are mountains of load-
ftones under the poles, difperfing their attractive fpirits through the univerfe, fpirits
which are entangled with thofe which adhere to the magnetical needle, whofe force
is leffened as the fpirits of it are diffipated ;
efpecially if the compafs be fet in a
place where there are pieces of iron to which the fpirits (tick, and leave the needle,
which had taken no greater quantity of them than what was requifite according to
its capacity. But the moft wonderful property in this ftone is, that it draws iron
on one fide, and rejects it on the other ;
fo that it appears in every loadftone that
there are two poles of the world, the north poleattradls iron, the fouth pole repels it;
becaufe the fpirit of the north pole enters in at the pores of the iron, but the fouthem,
cannot, for it ftrikes againft the iron, and drives back too much its elaftic particles.
This explication prefuppofes the being of fpirits and atoms, and their figures and
motions, as alfo fmall occult vacuities, which are difperfed through all bodies.
There are obferved to be many effects for which no reafon can be given, without
the help of the word antipathy. We will inftancefome few : and, firft, of thebafi-
liik, who kills all whom he fees, which is by the antipathy fubfifting betwixt it and
other animals ;
but this is rather done by the emiffion of certain venomous fpirits,
winch
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 31
which penetrate the eyes of thofe feen by the bafilifk ;
the nature of this poifon can-
not be explained, unlefs we know the occult property of poifon, becaufe poifon
kills only by a contrariety betwixt us and it; whence we difcover the principle of
this contrariety of the bafilitk, that the fpirits iffuingout of the pores of its eyes kill
thofe animals which they meet with, becaufe the fpirits penetrate them by their fub-
tilty, or ftiarp figure, like needles piercing the heart. The poifon of vipers, and
fuch like, is not fo acute nor fo deadly, nor fo ready in its effects, as that of the ba-
filifk. In reference to this matter, there are many things that are worth confidering.
In the firft place, it is certain that the bafilifk is not engendered but in moift deep
places, as in the bottom of pits where there is nothing but muddy, thick, ftinking,
water. In the /econd place, it is to be obferved, that, if you take a glafs, and hold
it againft the bafilifk ’s eyes, thofe fpirits which iffue from his eyes reflecting upon the
glafs are fent back from whence they came, and will kill the bafilifk. Now it cannot
be faid that the bafilifk hates itfelf; but that the venomous fpirits, reflecting from the
glafs, receive a more violent motion, and forcibly drive back the other fpirits which
are iffuing from his eyes, fo that they penetrate his brain and heart, and thence oc-
cafion his death; in the fame manner as vapours often arife w'itn fo great violence
from the hypochondria, the mefentery, and the ftomach, into the head, that they
caufe an apoplexy, epileptic dizzinefs, or lethargy ;
and fometimes they are carried
with fuch fubtilty and violence into the heart, that the perfons fo afflicted die fud-
denly.
A ftrange antipathy fubfifts in fome vegetables, as between the colewort and the
vine, which, if planted near together, will infenfibly give back and lean fideways,
as if they really hated one another. This effeCt cannot be afcribed to any thing but
the emiffion of the corpufcles and material fpirits of both of them, which ruth upon
one another, and mutually repel, by the irregularity of their figures. This is appa-
rent in the juice of coleworts, which if taken by a man when he is drunk, he pre-
fently comes to himfelf and is fober; becaufe the corpufcles of the juice of coleworts
blunt the corpufcles of the juice of the vine. In the fame manner, we find by ex-
perience, that fpirit of opium or laudanum cures the cholic, head-ach, tooth-ach, and
other kinds of pains ;
it alfo cures the phrenfy, and procures fleep. But there is
need of thegreateft care in ufing thefe narcotic medicines, becaufe it often happens
that the vital fpirits are fo ftupified by them, that they are deprived of their motion,
which caufes a deadly fleep. The colewort and the vine have not fo powerful an
effect on each other as narcotic medicines have on the animal fpirits ;
for neither
the vine nor the colewort will lean fideways if there be cloth or paper fet betw ixt
them, becaufe the corpufcles flowing from each are then flopped in their way.
1 A third
32 A KEY TO PHYSIC
A third effeCt, which is alcribed to antipathy, is obierved in the ufe ofmedicines, as
well internal as external ;
the external, of which we now fpeak, are thole we carry
about us, which by their quality take away the malign air, and prei'erve us from the
plague and other contagions; as prepared quickfilver, ora toad dried andlhut up in
a box. This phenomenon is afcribed to the peftiferous fpirits or corpufcles, which,
approaching towards us, find fubjedts more apt for their reception, and fix in them,
but not in us, atleaftin fuch a quantity as to hurt us; which moft evidently appears
in this, that the prepared quickfilver, or the toad, being once filled with thele con-
tagious atoms, becomes' ufelefs, and ought to be changed and renewed ;
and I know
by experience that quickfilver, prepared white and fhining like an adamant, or po-
lifhed filver, being carried about aperfon who is frequently with lick people, in time
becomes black, fo that afterwards it is ufelefs to him who carries it, becaufe there
are no fmall vacuities left to retain the airy poifons; but it may be renewed by ano-
ther preparation, whereby it may be made as white, tranl’parent, and ufeful, as before.
Quickfilver turns black more or lefs, fooner or later, according to the proportion of
the greater or lefs malignity in the air where the perfon goes who carries it about
him. And thefe antidotes can never hurt; nay, if rightly prepared, they not only
withstand the contagious air, when they hinder its nearer approach towards us, but
alfo fupprefs inward vapours, which, afcending into the head, occafion many dif-
tempers. Thefe confequences, properly fpeaking, are the joint effects of fympathy
and antipathy acting together ;
for the animal effluvia or corpufcles ilfuing from our
bodies repel as much as poffible the malignity of the ambient matter, by antipa-
thy ;
whilft bodies compofed of poifonous or noxious particles, draw to them-
felves, by fympathy, the foul or poifonous atoms which furround them, juft the
fame as the loadftone draws iron. In this we fee, and fhall hereafter prove, that
amulets or charms, worn about the body ;
that eleCtricity, animal magnetifm, and
other occult properties, aCting upon our bodies ;
though attributed to witchcraft, or
fome inexplicable caufe, are nothing more than the natural effects of fympathy and
antipathy, pre-ordained at the beginning of all things. Aromatic herbs and fweet-
linelling flowers, ufed againft infectious air, act by repulfion, or antipathy ;
whereas
nightfhade, hemlock, and all poifonous herbs, act by fympathy, drawing into their
pores the infectious atoms, juft the fame as horfe-radifh draws in vinegar ;
and
hence it follows that both thefe claffes of plants are ufeful in preferving the animal
juices from infection.
1 now proceed to effects internal. Rhubarb, and the leaves of fenna, purge
melancholy ;
jalop and diagridium, phlegm and waterifh humours. It is a conftant
and certain truth, that every purgative medicine comprehends in it certain fpirits
or
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 33"
or corpufcles which are venomous, that is, acute, pungent, and biting ;
lb that,
nature being ftirred up by them, and thereby the internal parts and membranes be-
ing touched and agitated, the animal lpirits ruth together in order to affift the part
affedted, and draw with them the foreign humours which are lefs fixed ;
and then
nature, by the help of thefe fpirits, expels them by the proper paffages : fo th-.t,
after a purgation by rhubarb, the urine is yellow, but, after fenna or caffia, it is
dark and high-coloured.
Thus fympathy and antipathy exift in all fubftances, whether animal, vegetable,
or mineral ;
and things of one clals have affinity or correfpondence with things
of another clafs, or contrariwife, accordirtg to the nature and quality of the atoms
or corpufcles whereof they are formed. Hence it is that fo ftrong a fympathy
exifts between rue and the fig-tree; and that the elm rejoiceth to cohabit with the
vine: and hence it is likewife that ferpents preferve -their fight by fennel; and
that the hind draws out the piercing dart with dittany, or garden-ginger. Hence
alfo, by antipathy, water and oil, and wine and the juice of hemlock, repel each
other; as do the vine and braffic plants; for the vine, which ufually entwines
round every thing it is near, ffiuns and inclines another way from thefe. Rue,
and the aih-tree, are fo inimical to ferpents, that they cannot exift under their
branches ;
and the herb polypody is fo obnoxious to crabs, that, if they are co-
vered over with its leaves, they will in a fhort time caft off their fhell and claws.
From an inveftigation of thefe properties in nature, medicine and the art of
healing were firft difcovered. All things temperate in quality concord fympatheti-
cally with our bodies ;
as fweet marjoram and nutmeg to the head, and wormwood
to the belly. Thofe which exceed this medium in their temperaments are noxious
and hurtful ;
and are the more dangerous or deadly, in proportion as they recede
from the temperate quality, which we perceive in opium, arfenic, and the like.
From this caufe, we likewile find that fympathy and fimilitude are fynonymous; and
that all fubftances which have refemblance by fignature, have fympathy and agree-
ment by nature, and ferve for the confervation of each other. Thus fulphur is found
to preferve wine, which hath great analogy with our blood; and, if wood, or cables,
or any thing whofe ufe is in the w?
ater, be done over with a preparation of the oil
of fulphur, they will be preferved, in a moft jingular and remarkable manner,
from injury or decay. From hence Paracelfus concludes, that the particles of
fulphur are of themfelvesa balfam, fufficient to prevent wine or any inanimate fub-
ftance from putrefadtion; and 1b conferves the body, that no adverfe qualities can
prejudice or affedt it. Querintius in his Pharmacy, allures us, that fulphur rightly
prepared is the true balfam of the lungs, and the principal ingredient uled by the
No. 3. K ancient
34 A KEY TO PHYSIC
ancient Egyptians to embalm their mummies, or bodies of their deceafed nobles,
whereby they are preferred even to this day from putrefaction, as may be feen
in the Britifh Mufeum, and in moft other magazines of curiofities. Sulphur is cer-
tainly the efficient caufe of all mineral fprings ;
of all cryftallizations, ftones, peb-
bles, See. by which they concrete, and are held together, as is evident from linking
them againft fteel, the fparks of fire produced being the fulphurous or inflammable
part. All volcanos, burning mountains, and fubterraneous fires, are occafioned
by fulphur; as are likewife earthquakes, thunder and lightning, meteors, &c. The
active properties of fulphur are indeed wonderful ;
and, were I to inftance many that
I have difeovered in the various chemical preparations I have made of it, few of my
readers would bedifpofed to give me credit. For ten lucceffive years I applied my-
feIf to the daily toil of making chemical experiments ;
and there is l'carcely an herb
ora mineral fubftance to be found, that I have not palled through the retort, or the
crucible, in order to afeertain their native qualities, and power of afilion, previous to
the invention of my Solar and Lunar Tinfitures ;
and I muft confefs that the occult
properties of fulphur coft me more labour to fix, to inveftigate, and to afeertain,
than all things elfe together, except mercury. And I do in confequence affirm, that
there are no mineral fuhftances in the bowels of the earth, whole virtues are not
communicated to plants and herbs growing on the earth’s furface ;
and that the
correfpondent virtues found in thefe herbs are infinitely more pure, innocent, bal-
famic, nutritive, and better adapted to medicine, than any grofs or earthy particles
whatever. Even from the common herb borage, we can extract nitre, fea-falt,
tartarum vitriolatum, and the common fixed alkali; and it is no trivial informa-
tion to the medical world, to know, that the three mineral acids are all to be found
in one humble plant. Indeed vegetables appear to be the medium contrived by an
all-wife and omnipotent Creator, for felefiling, concocting, and combining, the me-
dical and occult virtues of the different lubltances found in the bowels of the earth,
and for adapting their virtues by an eafy and natural concofilion to the alleviation
of human infirmities ;
according to that paffage in feripture which fays, that the Lord
hath caufed medicine to grow out ofthe earth,
andhe that is wise will not abhor them,
for withfuch doth he heal men,
and taketh away their pains. Eccl. xxxviii. 4, 7.
Whence I conclude, that all diforders incident to mankind are to be cured, pre-
ferably, and more elegantly, more fafely, and certainly, by preparations from me-
dical plants and herbs, than from any mineral fuhftances whatever; and that mer-
cury, for the lues venerea,
for the fcrophula, and impurities of the blood, ought to
be wholly expunged from our practice. Its baneful effefils are every day more or
lefs experienced, in the rotten bones and ruined conftitutions of thofe who have
habitually
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 35
habitually taken it in advertifed noftrums for a certain complaint, until it has fixed
itfelf, and the dil’eafe likewife, fo ftrongly in the habit, as to be almoft beyond the
reach of a proper remedy, which in reality and truth can only be found in the ve-
getable world.
Vegetables bear relation to the feven planets, and have form and affinity with the
microcofm, or parts of man; and conftitute the original aliment intended by the
Creator for the fuftenance of our bodies. And whatever fignatu re or fimilitude a
plant has with any member or part of our body, it will promote a cure in that
part, and tend fympathetically to its comfort and prefervatiou. For example, thofe
herbs which in any refpect refemble the form of the eyes, are lalubrious and heal-
ing to the eyes ;
as eyebright, fcabious, marigold, chameiion, fempervivum, nar-
dum, and ftar-wort. So plants which refemble the head are cephalic, and help the
diforders and infirmities thereof ;
the walnut refembles the brain, fo that, it the oil
or fpirit of the nut be applied to the head, it ftrengthens the fibres and comforts the
brain. Maidenhair and the mofs of quinces have the figure of the hair of our head
;
and a decofition of thefe herbs, in reftoring; hair loft by the lues venerea, is wonder-
fully efficacious. So plants, which in root, leaves, or fruit, refemble the figure of
the heart, have a power of comforting and fuftaining the heart : as the citron-apple,
fuller’s thiftle, fpikenard, mint, balm, white-beet, trefoil, and mother-wort. Herbs
which refemble the lungs promote refpiration, and ftrengthen the lungs ;
as hounds-
tongue, lung-wort, fage, camphor, wall-wort, &c. Plants which refemble the
ears conduce much to the relief of all diforders of the ears ;
as fools-foot, or wild
fpikenard, which are a fpecific for deafnefs ; and fo an oil extra&ed from the
fhell of fea-fnails, which refembles the ear, has been found of wonderful efficacy in
reftoring the faculty of hearing, even after feveral years deafnefs. The fenfe of
fmelling is greatly promoted by the application of thofe herbs which refemble the
nofe, as w^ater-mint, &c. So plants that bear refemblance with the womb, conduce
much to ftrengthen and comfort the fame, to purge the uterus, and promote fecun-
dity, as the round birth-wort, briony, ladies-feal, heart-wort, fatyrium, and man-
drakes, which have round and hollow roots. Plants which bear fimilitude with the
gall and bladder contribute to the benefit of thofe parts, by breaking the ltone,
ftrengthening the urinary paffiages, and bringing away the gravel ;
as particularly
pointed out in my edition of Culpeper’s Herbal. So likewife herbs and roots
which bear affinity with the generative parts contribute much to their virility,
ftrength, and vigour; and truffles, potatoes, and the capfula of the cafliew-tree,
which have fimilitude with the tefticles, wonderfully ftir up and promote the fe-
men ;
as do the parfnip, the root of rag-wort, and the mangel wurzel, or root of
fcarcity, .
-36 A KEY TO PHYSIC
fearcity; contribute much to ftimulate the virile member. Herbs having-forma-
tion like the milt,. nourifh and preferve the lame, fuch as fpleen-wort, milt-wort
lupines, and ivy. Plants which in leaves or roots bear fignature with the liver, do
wonderfully concur to promote a good digeftion and concoction of the blood, to
prevent the liver from decay, and to heal and cure all infirmities thereof: fuch vir-
tue has the herb trinity, agaric, liver-wort, fumitory, lent-figs, &c. Herbs and
feeds refembling the teeth confer much to the good and prefervation of them ;
as
tooth-wort, the pine-kernel, and the feeds of hemlock. Thole plants which have
refemblance with the knuckles and joints of the body, are wonderfully efficacious
againft the gout, white fwellings, and all pains whatever in the joints ;
fuch as ga-
Mngal and knotty odoriferous rulhes, &c. Plants and herbs expreffing a natural
fatnefsor oilinefs increafe corpulency,' or fatnefs of the body ;
as all pulfe, almonds,
and kernels of every kind ;
and, by the fame rule, thole vegetables which have a
lean and lpare defignation, macerate and reduce the body, fuch as farfaparilla, long-
leafed rofa-folis, &c. Nervous orftringy plants fupple and fortify the nerves and
linews ;
as fennel, flax, hemp, the nettle, the herb neuras, and the root of mallow's,.
Vegetables poflefling a milky juice propagate milk in all female animals ;
and thofe
pofleffing a fero us quality purge the noxious humours between the flefli and Ikin,
as fperage, fcammony, and the like. Plants that are hollow, as the ftalks of corn,
reeds, leeks, mallows, hollyocks, garlic, and buglofs, are Angularly good to purge,
open, and comfort, the porous and hollow organs of the body. St. John’s wort, ha-
ving its leaves perforated, is fanative to wounds; and palma Chrifti, having in its
root a ftrong refemblance of the hands and fingers, is remarkably healing to all
cuts, burns, fealds, and injuries, thereof.
There is another fimilitude found between fome vegetables and the brute fpecies,
which direfils us to a very curious occult virtue, in curing hurts or injuries received
from thofe creatures they bear affinity with. Thus, the herb dragon, w hich in form
refembles a fnake, and the bramble called Chrift’s-thorn, having its thorns fet like
the teeth of ferpents, are an abfolute cure for the bite of thofe animals. Ragwort,
which is like a bee, is the belt cure for the fting of bees. Fleabane, which grows
as if covered with vermin, caufeth all fleas to avoid the room. Scorpion-grafs,
dart-w7
ort, and the flowers of turnfol, having fimilitude with the tail of a fcorpion,
have furprifing efficacy in curing hurts by all venomous creatures.
The properties and virtues of plants are alfo known by the analogy of their form
;
thofe of the fame or like figure having the fame or like virtues and ufes. Thus the
umbelliferous tribe have all a carminative talte, or fmell, and are confequently powr -
•erful expellers of wind, and good in all flatulent dilorders. The galeate or verticil-
4, late
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 37
late kind are all of them a degree warmer, and more potent, and therefore may be
reputed aromatic, and proper for nervous diforders. The tetrapetalous kind are
hot and biting, and exert their power by means of a diuretic volatile fait with
which they abound, and are therefore good in chronical difeafes, obftruCtions, caco-
chvmias, &c.
The colours of plants and herbs likewife bear fimilitude or fympathy, and direct
us to a knowledge of their temperature and ufe; thole of a light colour, fuch as bri-
ony and water-lily, are profitable for the cure of phlegmatic difeafes. Thole of a
yellow afpefit purge choler, and remove obftruCtions occafioned thereby, as is the
effect of rhubarb, celandine, &c. Thofe of a fanguine hue purify the blood and
juices, and contribute greatly to a good complexion, as the root of fernbrake, agri-
mony, germander, and forrel. And this rule is to be obferved with refpect to
plants in general; that fo many diffinfit colours as it hath commixed, fo -many vir-
tues will it poffefs ;
and whatever difeafe it bears analogy or fympathy w'ith, that
difeafe it will cure. The flower of the water-lily, bearing the fignature of a drop
of water, is a prefervative again!! the apoplexy. The root of faffafras, and the
ftones of cherries, are good againft the ftone and gravel in the bladder and kidneys.-
The feeds of marigolds have refemblance with the canker, and are a certain cure for
that complaint. All plants of a glutinous nature, having their ftalks fignated with
cuts and ftabs, are fanative to cuts, fears, and wounds. The root of galangale
growing in marlhy grounds, and taken up in May or June, and worn as an amulet
againft the belly, will perform moft aftoniftiing cures in the dyfentery and flux ; it
has a Itrong refemblance to the natural excrements, both in figure and colour..
All the excrefcences of trees arifing above the branches, are good againft ex-
crefcences of the arteries. The ftraw-berry very much refembles puftules of the
leprofy ;
and the diftilled water of ftrawberries is a moft admirable cure for that
complaint, as well as for red and pimpled faces.
We may further remark, that the more fignatures or fimilitudes are found co-
hering in a plant to one and the fame fignification, fo mueh the more powerful and
efficacious will its operation be, in any of the purpofes for which it is applied ;
for
the fpirit is in quality the fame in all bodies, but different in quantity, which confti-
tutes that variety or difference perceivable by our fenfes. In fome bodies this
fpirit is more copious and afitive; in others, more lparing and debilitated ;
fo that,-
by how much the more the fame fpirit produces a convenient form and figure, in
divers things or fubje&s under the fame climate, by fo much the more the fame
fubjects are enabled to fympathize with, and aflift, each other. For fympathy is
by the fpirit ;
and fimilitude points out the things that a£t by fympathy. Hence it
No. 3*. L is
38 A KEY TO PHYSIC
is that {iuiilitude of afteCtion increafes ftrength, and the contrary, hatred. So it is
that plants whole parts refemble the fcorpion, as libards-bane, hellebore and aconi-
turn, will cure the bite of that reptile ;
and that the flowers of plants, having the
refemblance of butterflies, conduce to fruitfulnefs and virility, as gandergoofe, the
flower of beans, woodbine, and ragwort. Plants fpotted like ferpents, as cow-
garhc, wake-robin, dragon-wort, fea-dragon, &c; .
are fanative againft the bite of
ferpents ;
and plants which refemble the head of fuch animals are alfo good againft
their poifon ;
as the flowers of wild buglofs, which refemble the head of a viper,
Diofcorides affirms to be a certain cure.
The virtues of plants and herbs are, however, variable, and liable to be injured
by change of climate, which will alter or deftroy them, as we fee in many of the
medical plants of other countries brought into England ;
which, though they feem
to flourifli with us, never poflefs, their virtues in the fame excellent degree as in
their own climate, which is the reafon that Culpeper recommends Englijk herbs
for an Engl'ifi conjlitution. The bodies of different animals alfo render the effect
of the fame plant different ;
the tythmals, or fpurges, being all very violent cathar-
tics when taken by us ;
but yet they are eaten by goats and feveral other animals,
without any purgative effect, and feem to give them a particular fliare of vigour
and fpirits. Fifties, on the contrary, are more ftrongly affedted by them than we
are ;
for the juice of fpurge, made into a pafte with flour and honey, will fo much
intoxicate them, that they may be taken out of the water with one’s hand. Again,
bitter almonds are of no ill confequence to us, yet they kill all forts of birds that
touch them. The Buceros, oY hornbill, feeds upon the nux vomica,
which is known
to be a moft deadly poilbn to man and all quadrupeds and fifties. This is a late
dilcovery. See my Syftem of Nat. Hift. vol. viii. p. 153. and Encyclopedia
Londinensis, vol. iii. p. 478.
The foregoing notions may be ridiculed, from their extreme fimplicity; yet
where is the man, at all converlant with natural philofophy and phyfic, and poflefled
of an impartial mind, that will dare to controvert thefe facts ? Every wayfaring man
know's fomething of the herbs I have mentioned, and is capable of judging of their
fimilitude and fympathy. Let him apply them for the purpofes I have pointed out,
and their occult properties will foon be vifible to his fenfes. The track of nature
is a plain and obvious road, abounding with moft pleafing profpeffts, and the fureft
guides. God, in the plenitude of his onmifcience and mercy, feems to have fet a.
mark on the minuteft particles of his creation, for man’s information and benefit
;
in the contemplation of which, our happine'fs, as well as our health, will invariably
be found.

Of the OCCULT PROPERTIES or GENERATION
in PLANTS and HERBS.
ALL plants are produced from feeds, as all animals are produced from eggs, and
the procefs of nature is very fimilar in both kinds of generation. The fmalleft ve-
getables have feeds, though often not difcoverable by the naked eye. Miftletoe is
known to be produced from feed ;
and the feffile and flat funguies, which fome
confider as morbid excrefcences, are true fpecies of thole agarics which are fur-
nifhed with caps and ftems, and grow on the ground, whole feeds, falling on a
moift tree, produce, as it were, half-caps without ftems. Redes, that feeds are
the eggs of plants appears from hence, that, as every egg produces an offspring
fimilar to the parent, fo do alfo the feeds of vegetables ;
and therefore they alfo
are eggs. A feed refembles the egg of an hen ;
as this, as well as the egg, has a
fhell, external membrane or film, a membrane including the yolk, the yolk itfel'f,
and the fear, or point of life. In feeds, the white is wanting, becaufe the moifture
of the earth fupplies its place, and nourifhes the embryo of the plant. When the
flower is going off, the feed begins to fwell, and on the outfide there appears a ve-
ficle, which is the amnion, furniflied with an umbilical chord, or navel-ftring, which
is introduced through the chorion to the oppofite fide of the egg. While with the
egg the amnion increafes, on its top is obferved another fmall body, which like-
wife increafes continually, till it has filled the whole chorion and egg; and the am-
nion and chorion are turned into the external fhell or coat of the feed. Thus, as
the fame changes are brought about on the feed as in the egg, the feeds muft be the
eggs of plants. Farther, that plants fpring from eggs, is plain from the lobes,
which, when we fpeak of cows and fimilar quadrupeds, are nothing elfe than fe-
veral fecundines, always adhering to the foetus, drawing their fupply or fluids from
the matrix, which fluids they prepare for the nourifliment of the tender foetus.
That moft plants have feminal leaves, or lobes, is very well known. Thefe feminal
leaves once confti tilted the whole feed, except the hilum, or little heart, in which
is the point of life ;
and thefe lobes prepare the nourifliment for the very tender
plant, until it be able to Itrike root in the earth ;
in the fame manner as the yolk in
an egg, becoming the placenta, prepares the nourifhment, and fends it by the
navel-ftring to the chick; after which they drop off. Hence it appears, that the
feminal leaves are the lobes; but, fince all lobes proceed from the egg or feed, we
may fairly conclude that plants are produced from eggs. But, as no egg can pro-
duce an animal till it be impregnated or fecundated by the male, it will be necef-
fary to inveftigate the fituation of the genital organs deftined by nature for this
purpofe in plants.
It
40 A KEY TO PHYSIC
It is plain that the genital organs of plants muft be fituated where the feeds are
produced ;
now the feeds are produced where the flower and fruit are ;
therefore in
the flower and fruit are the genital organs of plants. And, as there was never a clear
and evident example produced of any plant which wanted flowers and fruit, though
they might not be diftinctly known on account of their exceeding minutenefs, we
may jultly fay, that the eflence of plants conflfts in their fru&ification, More-
over, as generation precedes the birth in animals, the flower in plants always pre-
cedes the fruit; and, therefore, we are neceflarily led to afcribe fecundation to the
fiovcer, and the birth or exclulion of the feed to the ripe fruit The flower may,
confequently, be defined to be the genital organs of a plant, ferving for fecunda-
tion, and the fruit to be the genital organs ferving for the birth or maturation of
the leed. And, fince we know that there are many plants, fome of which want the
calyx, others the corolla, others the filaments of the ftamina, and others the ftyle
;
but that all flowers, the mofles only excepted, are furniflied with the anther®, or
ftigmata, or both together; thefe parts muft conftitute the eflence of the flow-er.
If we find a flower with anther®, but no ftigmata, we may alfo afiuredly find ano-
ther flowmr, either in the fame or a different plant of the fame fpecies, which has
ftigmata with the anther®, or without them. The aft of fecundation is performed
in the flower ;
and therefore the genital organs of both fexes muft be prefent in
thepflower ;
not indeed always in one and the fame flower ;
but it is fufficient that
thofe of the male be in one flower, and thofe of the female in another ;
and thefe
genital organs are the anther® and ftigmata. The anther®, or male organs of ge-
neration in flowers, are nothing elfe but the bodies which prepare and contain the
male fperm ;
therefore thefe anther® are the tefticles together with the feminal ve-
ficles, and their duft the genuine male fperm of plants, anfwering to thofe par-
ticles which are called animalcules in the male fperm of animals. This propofi-
tion may be evinced by the following arguments: the anther® and the duft always
come before the fruit ; and, when they Ihed their duft, which they do before the
flower has attained its full vigour, they have performed their office, and then drop
and become ufelefs. Befides, the anther® are fo fituated in the flower, that their
duft, which is the male fperm, may reach the piftil or female organs ;
for the fta-
mina either furround the piftil, as in moft flowers, or, if the piftil incline to the up-
per fide of the flower, the ftamina do the fame ;
or, if the piftil nods, the ftamina
afcend.
Farther, the anther® and ftigmata are in full vigour at the fame time, both
when they are in tfie fame flower, and when they are in feparate flow'ers. More-
over, if we cut afunder the anther® before they have Hied their duft, their ftruc-
ture will be found altogether as wonderful and curious as that of the feed-
veflels
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 41
vefiels them Pelves; for, within, they confift of one, two, three, or four, cells;
and they open either longitudinally or at the bale, fcparating into pieces or
valves, or from the top, or at the two points or horns. And, if we cut off the
anther® of any plant which hears but one flower, taking care at the fame time
that no other plant of the fame fpecies is near it, the fruit proves abortive, or at
leaft produces feeds which will not vegetate. Finally, the figure of the fertilizing
duff will clearly convince any one, that this fine powder is not accumulated by
chance, or from the drynefs of the anther®.
The powder of the anther®, in point of fecundation, anfvvers to the animalcules
in the male fperm ;
and the ftigma which receives this duft is always moiftilh,
that the duft may inftantly adhere or ftick to it. That the ftigmata, which are
the other effential parts of the flower, are the female organs of generation, may be
proved by the following confiderations : the parts of the piftillum are the ger-
men, the ftyle, and the ftigma ;
the germen, or feed-bud, while the plant is in
flower, is always imperfect and immature, being only the rudiment of the future
foetus ;
the ftyle is no effential part, for it is wanting in many fpecies of plants
;
but the germen can never bring the fruit to maturity, except it be within the
flower along with the ftigma. Hence it follows, that the ftigma is that part of the
flower which receives the impregnating duft. This will farther appear, if we
confider that the ftigma is always fofituated, that the anther®, or their impregnating
duft, can reach it : moreover, it has always a figure peculiar to itfelf, fo that in
molt (though not all) plants it is double when the fruit confifts of two cells ;
triple
when the leed-veffel has three cells ;
quadruple when it has four cells, &c. Again,
the ftigmata are always in full vigour at the fame time with the anther® : befides,
the ftigmata in moft plants, when they have difcharged their office, drop off in the
fame manner as the anther® do ;
which proves, that the ftigmata contribute
nothing to the ripening of the fruit, but lerve only for the purpofe of genera-
tion. If the ftigmata be cut off before they have received the impregnating duft
of the anther®, the plant is caftrated as to the female organs, and the fruit
periffies. The ftigma of the flower has, befides, two other Angular properties
:
viz. that it is always divefted of the cuticle or film, nor has it any bark as the other
parts have, and it is always bedewed with a moifture.
Upon the wffiole it appears, that the generation of plants is accomplifhed by the an-
ther® thedding their duft on the ftigmata. In the generation of animals, we are certain,
that the male fperm muff come in contact with the female organ, if there be any im-
pregnation. In the vegetable kingdom, the genital duft is carried by the air to the
rnoift ftigmata, where the particles burft and difcharge their exceeding fine or
No. 3. M foluble
42 A KEY TO PHYSIC
foluble contents, which impregnate the ovary. This will appear if it be confi-
dered, that, when a plant is in flower, and the duft of the anthers^ flying about,
part of this duft viflblv lights upon and clings to the ftigma; the ftamina and
piftillum are generally of the fame height, that the male duft may more eafily
come at the ftigma ;
and, in thofe plants where this is not the cafe, a 'Angular pro-
cefs of fecundation may be obferved ;
thus in the African tree crane’s-bill, or
Geranium inquinans, where the piftillum is fhorter than the ftamina, the flowers be-
fore they blow are pendulous, but upon their opening they ftand upright, that the
powder may fall upon the ftigma; after which they again nod till the fruit is ripe,
and then ftand upright a fecond time, that their feeds may be more eafily fcattered
about. In fome of the pinks, the piftilla, which are longer than the ftamina, are
bent back like rams-horns towards the antherm.
Again, the ftamina for the moft part furround the piftillum, fo that fome of
the duft is always blown by the wind on the ftigma. Moreover, the ftamina and
piftillum come at the fame time, not only in one and the fame flower, but alfo
where fome are male and others female on the fame plant, very few excepted.
Farther, in almoft all forts of flowers we fee how they expand or open by the
heat of the fun ;
but in the evening, and in a moift ftate of the air, they dole or
contract their flowers, left the moifture, getting to the duft of the antheras, flaould
coagulate the fame, and render it incapable of being blown on the ftigma ; but
when once the fecundation is over, the. flowers neither contract in the evening, nor
yet againft rain. The wind on many occafions ferves as a vehicle for bringing the
farina of the males to the females. M. Geoftroy cites a ftory from Jovius Pon-
tanus, who relates that in his time there were two palm-trees, the one male,
cultivated at Brindifi, the other female, in the wood of Otranto, fifteen leagues
apart ;
that this latter was feveral years without bearing any fruit ;
till at length,
rifing above the other trees of the foreft, fo as it might fee (fays the poet) the
male palm-tree at Brindifi, it then began to bear fruit in abundance. M. Geoffroy
makes no doubt but that the tree then only began to bear fruit, becaul’e, it was
in a condition to catch on its branches the farina of the male, brought thither by
the wind. In the male and female of the piftachia-nut-tree they oblerve the fame
method as in thofe of the date-tree. We may oblerve farther, that, lince the male
duft is generally of greater fpecific gravity than the air, in moft plants that have
the piftillum longer than the ftamina, the all-wile Creator has made the flowers
nodding, that the powder may more eafily reach the ftigma. With refped to
thofe plants whofe ftems grow under water, the flowers, a little before they
blow, emerge or rife above the furface of the water ;
and thole, all whofe parts
grow
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 43
grow under water, about the time of flowering raif'e their genital ftems above
the water, which ftems fink again as foon as the time of generating is over. A
fimilar conclufion may be farther eftabliflied from the consideration of all forts of
flowers; but enough has been laid to prove that the generation of plants is per-
formed by the genital duft of the anther® falling on the moift ftigma, or female
organ ;
which duft, by the help of the moifture, adheres and burfts, difeharging
its contents, the fubtile particles of which are abforbed by the Style into the ova-
rium, germen, or feed-bud. However, the duft of the anther® does not penetrate
through the ftyle to the germen and rudiments of the feed, as fome writers have
fuppofed: the contrary appears to be the cafe from opening a flower of the oriental
rough poppy, with a large flower, cutting its piftillum perpendicularly down-
wards; and the lamell® or folds, the placentae, and the fmall feeds fticking to
them, will be found of a pure white colour, though at the fame time the ftyle and
all the ftigmata are wfflolly tinged with a purple hue from the duft of the anther®.
Hence we conclude, that not one grain or particle of the farina enters tlie folds of
the receptacle or feeds themfelves.
We may clofe this account with obferving upon the whole, that the calyx is
the marriage-bed, in which the ftamina and piftilla, the male and female organs,
celebrate the nuptials of plants, and where they are cheriihed and defended from
external injuries: the corolla or petals are the curtains clofely furrounding the
genital organs, in order to keep off/torm, rain, or cold; but, when the fun
fhines bright, they freely expand, to give accefs both to the fun’s rays and to the
fecundating duft: the filaments are the fpermatic veflels, by which the juice, fe-
creted from the plant, is carried to the anther® ;
the anther® are the tefticles, and
may not improperly be compared to the foft roe or milt of fifhes : the duft of the
anther® anfwers to the fperm and feminal animalcules ;
for, though it is dry, that
it may be the more eafily conveyed by the wind, yet it gets moifture upon touch-
ing the ftigma : the ftigma is that external part of the female organ which re-
ceives the male duft, and on w'hich the male duft a£ts : the ftyle is the vagina, or
tube, through which the effluvia of the male duft pafs to the germen, or leed-bud :
the germen is the ovary, for it contains the unimpregnated or unfertilized feeds
:
the pericarpium, or feed-veflel, anfwers to the impregnated ovary, and in fact is
the fame with the germen, or feed-bud, only increafed in bulk, and loaded with
fertile feeds ;
the feeds are the eggs. Moreover, the calyx is a production of the
external bark of the plant; the corolla of the inner bark; the ftamina of the al-
burnum, or white fap; the pericarpium, or feed-veflel, of the woody fubftance ;
and the feeds of the pith of the tree ;
for in this manner they are placed, and in
this
44 A KEY TO PHYSIC
this they are alfo unfolded ;
fo that in the flower we find all the internal parts of a
plant unfolded.
The ftomach of plants is the earth, from which they receive their nourifhment
;
and the fmeft and moft fubtile parts of its foil is their chyle : the root, which car-
ries the chyle from the ftomach to the body of the plant, is analogous to the lafcteals
or cliyliferous veflels of animals : the trunk, which lupports and gives ftrength to
the whole plant, is analogous to the bones ;
the leaves, by which plants tranfpire,
are inftead of lungs, and they may be alfo compared to tire mufcles of animals, for
by their agitation with the wind the plant is put in motion ;
on which account,
herbs furniflied with leaves cannot thrive except they have air; but fuccuient
plants, which have no leaves, though fhut up in green-boufes and quite deprived of
the external air, thrive very well. Heat is to plants analogous to the heart in animals;
for they have no heart, nor have they occafion for any ;
becaule they live like po-
lypes in the animal kingdom ;
their juices mixed with air being propelled through
their veffels, but not circulated back again by returning veflels. Plants have ge-
nerally their genital organs placed at their ramifications, as animals have theirs at
the ramification of the iliac veflels, with this difference, that the ramifications of
plants afcend, whereas thole of animals go downwards or backwards ;
whence the
ancients called a plant an inverted animal. Pliny obferves, that there is in plants
-a natural inftinct to generation; and that the males, by a certain blaft and a fubtle
powder, do confummate the nuptials on the females.
For the manner wherein the farina fecundities, M. Geoffrey advances two opi-
nions :
—1. That the farina being always found of a fulphureous compofition, and
full of fubtile penetrating parts (as appears from its fprightly odour), falling on the
piftils of the flowers, there refolve^, and the fubtileft of its parts, penetrating the
fubftance of the piftil and the young fruit, excite a fermentation to open and un-
fold the young plant, inclofed in the embryo of the feed. In this hypothecs the
feed is fuppofed to contain the plant in miniature, and only to want a proper juice
to unfold its parts, and make them grow. 2. The fecond opinion is, that the farina
of the flower is the firft germ or bud of the new plant, and needs nothing to unfold
it, and enable it to grow, but the juice it finds prepared in the embryos of the feed.
Thefe two theories of vegetable generation, the reader will obferve, bear a ftri6l
analogy to thole two of animal generation: viz. either that the young animal is in the
femenmafculinum, and only n&eds the juice of the matrix to cherifh and bring it forth; or
that the animal is contained in the female ovum, and needs only the male feed to excite
a fermentation, &c. M. Geoffrey rather takes the proper feed to be in the farina; inal-
much as the beft microfcopes do notdifcovertheleaftappearanceof any budin the little
1 embryos
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 45
embryos of the grains, when examined before the apices have died their duft. In
leguminous plants, if the leaves and ftamina be removed, and the piftil, or that part
which becomes the pod, be viewed with the microfcope, before the flower he
opened; the little green tranfparent veficulce, which are to become the grains, will
appear in their natural order; but (till fhowing nothing elfe but the mere coat or
{kin of the grain. If the obfervation be continued for feveral days fuccejTively, in
other flowers, as they advance, the veficulce will be found to fwell, and by degrees
to become replete with a limpid liquor; wherein, when the farina comes to bellied,
and the leaves of the flower to fall, we obferve a little greenifli fpeck, or globule,
floating about at large. At firft there is not any appearance of organization in this
little body; but in time, as it growls, we begin to diftinguilh two little leaves like
two horns. T^lie liquor diminiflies infenfibly, as the little body grows, till at length
the grain becomes quite opaque; when, upon opening it, we find its cavity filled
with a young plant in miniature; confiding of a little germ or plumula, a little
root, and the lobes of the bean, or pea, &c.
The manner wherein this germ of the apex enters the veficula of the feed, is not
very difficult to determine. For, befides that the cavity of the piftil reaches from
the top to the embryos of the grains, thofe grains or veficulas have a little aperture
correfponding to the extremity of the cavity of the piftil, fo that the ftnall duft, or
farina, may eafily fall through the aperture into the mouth of the veficula, which
is the embryo of the grain. This cavity, or cicatricula, is much the fame in moft
grains, and it is eafily obferved in peafe, beans, &c. without the microfcope. The
root of the little germ is juft againft this aperture, and through this it paflfes out
when the little grain comes to germinate.
From what has been faid, it becomes evident, that, unlefs the female plant is im-
pregnated by the male, it can bring forth no fruit, nor feed, that will grow. This
holds good throughout the whole fyftem of vegetation. But, as trees and plants are
immoveably fixed, and cannot like animals rove about in fearch of a mate, the all-
wife Creator has compenfated this, by means of little infe&s, the bee, and the
w inds, which doubtlefs carry the pollen, or fecundating matter of the male, to the
piftilla of the female, whereby impregnation and generation follow. But as this,
in the produ6tion of fruits, is rather a fortuitous event, uffiich fometimes happens
in profufion, and at others but fparingly, thofe who cultivate fruits have been led
by art to aflift nature in this neceffary conta6fc of the fexes. While in Arabia, I was
taken to fee this curious operation performed on the date- tree, by which the Arabs
always fecure to themfelves a plentiful harveft of that fruit, which is of fo much
importance to their traffic, and amongft whom this art appears to have been known

long before any botanifl dreamed of the difference of fexes in vegetables. Of this
the gardener informed me, but was furprifed to find I knew the circumftance be-
fore; “ for (fays he) all who come from Europe to this country have regarded this-
operation as a fable. When they obferve a tree where the fpadix has female
flowers, they fearch on a tree that has male flowers (which they know by euftom
and experience) for a male fpadix which has not yet burft out of its fpatha or hulk;
this they open, take out the fpadix, and cut it lengthwife in feveral pieces, taking
care not to hurt the flowers. Thefe pieces of fpadix with male flowers they put
lengthwife between the fmall branches of the fpadix which hath female flowers, and
then cover them over with a palm-leaf; in this fituation the piflilla of the female
flower becomes impregnated by the male, which foon after withers and dies; and,
unlefs the natives thus wed and fecundate the female date-tree, it bears no fruit.
Or even if they permit the fpadix of the male flower to burft, or come out, before
it is taken, it is ufelefs for fecundation; it muft for this purpofe have its maiden-
head, as the Arabs term it, or it will not do; and this is loft the fame moment the
bloffoms burft out of their cafe.” From this curious procefs of nature in the ge-
neration of vegetables, and from a contemplation of the apparatus fhe has contrived
for that purpofe, many ufeful hints may be derived how to alter, improve, enrich,,
and vary, the tafte, form, and quality, of fruits, &c. by impregnating the flower of
one with the farina of another of the fame clafs ;
and to this artificial coupling and
mixing it is, that the numberlefs varieties of new fruits, flowers, See. produced every
year by our nurfery-men and gardeners, with many other phenomena in the vege-
table kingdom, are to be aferibed.
In the cultivation of many of our home-plants, we fometimes meet with circum-
ftances not unftmilar to thofe of the date-tree, vyhich become barren when deprived
of the males. Thus, if the flowers of the male hemp are pulled off before thofe of
the female are fully expanded, the females do not produce fertile feeds. But, as a
male flower is fometimes found upon a female plant, this may be the reafon why
fertile feeds are fometimes produced even after this precaution has been obferved..
The tulip affords another experiment to the fame purpofe.—Cutoff all the antherae
of a red tulip before the pollen is emitted; then take the ripe antherse of a white
tulip, and throw the pollen of the white one upon the ftigma of the red; the feeds
of the red tulip, being thus impregnated by one of a different complexion, will next
feafon produce fome red, fome white, but moftly variegated, flowers.
In the year 1744, Linqssus publilhed a defeription of a new genus, which he called
peloria, on the fuppofition of its being a hybrid or mule plant, i. e. a plant produced
by an unnatural commixture of two different genera. The root, leaves, caulis, &c.
of
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 47
of this plant, are exceedingly fimilar to thofe of the Antirrhinum linaria, or com-
mon yellow toad-flax ; but the flower and other parts of the frudlification are
totally different. On account of its flmilarity to the linaria in every part but the
flow’er, Linnasus imagined it to have been produced by a fortuitous commixture
of the linaria with fome other plant ;
and from this dodlrine he fuppofes that only
two fpecies of each genus of plants exifled ab origine, and that all the variety of
fpecies which now appear have been produced by unnatural embraces betwixt
fpecies of different genera. Under this head he defends the cafe of Richard
Baal, gardener at Brentford. This Baal fold a large quantity of the feeds of the
Braflica florida to feveral gardeners in the fuburbs df London. Thefe gardeners,
after flowing their feeds in the uflual manner, were furprifed to find them turn out
to be plants of a different fpecies from that which Baal made them believe they
had purchafed; for, inftead of the Braffica florida, the plants turned out to be the
Braflica longifolia. The gardeners, upon making this diflcovery, commenced a
profecution of fraud againft Baal in Weftminfter-hall. The court found Baal
guilty of fraud, and decerned him not only to reftore the price of the feeds, but
likewife to pay the gardeners for their loft time, and the ufe of their ground.
“ Had thefe judges (fays Linnaeus) been acquainted with the fexual generation
of plants, they would not have found Baal guilty of any crime, but would have
afcribed the accident to the fortuitous impregnation of the Braflica florida by the
pollen of the Braflica longifolia.”
With refpedt to the nourifhment of plants, we need only recur to the analogy that
is known to fubfift between plants and animals. It is highly probable that the ra-
dical fibres of plants take up their nourifhment from the earth, in the fame manner
that the ladteal veflels abforb the nutriment from the inteftines ; and, as the oily and
watery parts of our food are perfe&ly united into a milky liquor, by means of the
fpittle, pancreatic juice, and bile, before they enter the ladleals, we have all the
reafon imaginable to keep up the analogy, and fuppofe that the oleaginous and
watery parts of the foil are alfo incorporated, previous to their being taken up by
the abforbing veflels of the plant. To form a perfedt judgment ot this, we mult
refledt that every foil, in a Rate of nature, has in itfelf a quantity of abforbent
earth, fufficient to incorporate its inherent oil and water ;
but, when we load it
with fat manures, it becomes eflentially necefiary to beftow upon it, at the fame
time, fomething to aflimilate the parts. Lime, foap-alhes, kelp, marl, and all the
alkaline fubftances, perform that office. In order to render this operation vifible
to the fenfes, diflolve one dram of Ruflia pot-alli in four ounces of w'ater ;
then add
one' fpoonful of oil; lhake the mixture, and it will inftantly become an uniform
mafs of a whitifh colour, adapted to all the purpofes of vegetation. This eafy and
familiar
48 A KEY TO PHYSIC
familiar experiment is a juft representation of what happens after the operation of
burn-baking, and confequcntly may be conftdered as a confirmation of the hypo-
thefts advanced. In this procefs, the fward being reduced to allies, a fixed alkaline
fait is produced; the moifture of the atmolphere loon reduces that fait into a
fluid ftate, which, mixing with the .foil, brings about an union of the oily and
watery parts, in the manner demonstrated in the experiment. When the under
ftratum confifts of a rich vegetable mould, the effects of burn-baking will belafting;
but, when the foil happens to be thin and poor, the firft crop frequently fuffers
before it arrives at maturity. The farmer, therefore, who is at the expenfe of
paring and burning a thin foil, Should beftow upon it a portion of rotten dung, or
Shambles manure, before the afhes are fpread, in order to fupply the deficiency of
oily particles : in this way the crop will be fupported during its growth, and the
land will be preferved in health and vigour. But plants not only receive nourish-
ment by their roots, but alfo by their leaves. Vegetables that have a fucculent
leaf, fuch as vetches, peafe, beans, and buck-wheat, draw a great part of their
nourishment from the air, and on that account impoverish the foil lefs than wheat,
oats, barley, or rye, the leaves of which are of a firmer texture. Rape and hemp
are oil-bearing plants, and, confequently, impoveriShers of the foil ;
but the former
lefs fo than the latter, on account of the greater fucculency of its leaf. The
leaves of all kinds of grain are fucculent for a time, during w'hich period the
plants take little from the earth ;
but, as foon as the ear begins to be formed,
they lofe their foftnefs, and diminish in their attradlive power. The radical fibres
are then more vigorously employed in extradling the oily particles of the earth for
the nourishment of the feed. The leaves of plants ferve, not only as excretory
dudts to Separate and carry off the redundant watery fluid, which, by being long
detained in the plants, would turn rancid and prejudicial to them, but likewife to
imbibe the dew and rain, which contain fait, fulphur, &c. and to be of the fame
ufe to plants that the lungs are to animals. But, as plants have not a dilating
and contradling thorax, their infpirations and expirations will not be fo frequent
as thofe of animals, but depend wholly on the alternate changes from hot to cold
for infpiration, and vice verfa for expiration. But the greater part of their nou-
rishment is derived from the roots. Thefe, therefore, are found to bear a con-
fiderable proportion to the body of the plant above ground ; the fuperficies of
the former being above four-tenths of that of the latter. Hence appears the ne-
ceffity of cutting off many branches from a transplanted tree ;
becaufe, in digging
it up, a great part of the root is cut off.
It is a curious occult fa 61,

fuch as would prove fatal to human life, yet thofe very plants exhale a diredf oppo-
fite effluvium, tending to refrefh and fweeten the atmofphere, and to render it whole-
fome, when it is become noxious in confequence of epidemical complaints, or of
animals dying and putrifying in it ;
whence it follows that vegetables draw in the
foul or infe&ed corpufcles, as favourable to their fuftenance, which being con-
codted, altered, and changed, in the body of the plant, it again emits them purified
and fweet. This I have proved by the following experiment : A quantity of air
was made thoroughly noxious, by fome mice breathing and dying in it. This I
divided into two parts, in glafs receivers. Into one I put a moufe with a fprig of
mint, which lived very well, and the mint alfo flourifhed ; but in the other, where
there was no mint, the moufe died almoft immediately. This experiment I have
many times repeated with different kinds and portions ofinfected air, and have always
found the refult nearly the fame ;
wherefore this plain reafoning follows ;
that, as
vegetables draw in by their leaves and roots the putrid effluvium of the air, fo their-
emiffion of purified corpufcles contributes to make the remaining air more fit and
wholefome for refpiration ;
and from this circumflance I recommend all perfons
who vifit the lick, or have putrid diforders in their families, to ufe as many frefli
vegetables as poffible, and never to be without forne fprigs of mint about them.
Of SYMPATHY, ANTIPATHY, SAGACITY, and OCCULT
INSTINCT, in BRUTES.
BRUTE is a general name given to all animals except man; and an animal
muft be an organized living body, endowed with fenfe ;
for minerals are faid to
grow and increafe, plants to grow and live; but animals alone are endowed with
fenfation. It is this property of fenfation alone, that conflitutes the effential cha-
ra6teriftic of an animal ;
and by which the animal and vegetable kingdoms feem to
be fo materially feparated. Thofe naturalifls, who have fuppofed the di6tin£tion
between animals and vegetables to confifl in any thing elfe than the gift of fenfation,
have found themfelves greatly embarraffed ; and have generally agreed, that it was
extremely difficult, if notimpoffible, to fettle the boundaries between the animal and
vegetable kingdoms. But this difficulty will be eafily feen to arife from their taking
the chara6teriftic marks of the animal kingdom from fomething that was evidently
common to both. Thus Boerhaave attempted to diffcinguifli an animal from a vege-

table, by the former having a mouth, which the latter has not : but here, as the
mouth of an animal is only the inftrument by which nourifhment is conveyed to its
body, it is evident that this can be no effential didinction, becaufe vegetables, as
we have above demondrated, require nourifhment, and have inflruments proper for
conveying it into their bodies; and where the end is the fame, a difference in the
means can never be effential. The fixing the difference in an animal’s having a
gula, ftomach, and inteftines, as is done by Dr. Tyfon, is as little to the purpofe.
The power of moving from one place to another, hath by many been thought to
conftitute their effential difference; and indeed, in moll cafes, it is the obvious mark
by which we diftinguifh an animal from a vegetable ;
but Lord Karnes hath given
us feveral very curious inftances of the locomotive power of plants; fome of
which would doubtlefs do honour to an animal.—Upon the flighted; touch, the
fenfitive plant fhrinks back, and folds up its leaves,* fimilar to a fnail, which on
the flighted; touch retires within its fhell. If a fly perch upon one of its flower-leaves,
it clofes indantly, and crufhes the infedt to death. There is not an article in botany
more admirable than a contrivance, vifible in many plants, to take advantage of
good weather, and to protect themfelves againd bad. They open and clofe their
flowers and leaves in different circumdances; fome clofe before funfet, fome after:
fome open to receive rain, fome clofe to avoid it. The petals of many flowers ex-
pand in the fun ;
but contract at night, or on the approach of rain. After the feeds
are fecundated, the petals no longer contradh All the trefoils may ferve as a baro-
meter to the hufbandman; they always contract their leaves on an impending dorm.
Some plants follow the fun, others turn from it. Many plants, on the fun’s recefs,
vary the pofition of their leaves, which is ftyled the Jleep of plants. A Angular
plant was lately difcovered in Bengal : its leaves are in continual motion all day
long : but, when night approaches, they fall down from an ereid podture to red.
A plant has a power of diredlingits roots for procuring food. The red whortle-
berry, a low ever-green plant, grows naturally on the tops of our highed hills,
among dones and gravel. This fhrub was planted in an edging to a rich border,
under a fruit-wall. In two or three years, it over-ran the adjoining deep-laid gravel
walk; and feemed to fly from the border, which was not congenial to its nature,
and in which not a Angle runner appeared. An effort to come at food in a bad
fituation, is extremely remarkable in the following indance : Among the ruins of
New Abbey, formerly a monadery in Galloway, there grows on the top of a wall a
plane-tree about twenty feet high. Straitened for nourifhment in that barren fitua-
tion, it feveral years ago dire6ted roots down the fide of the wall, till they reached

the
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 51
the ground ten feet below ;
and now the nourifhment it afforded to thofe roots
during the time of their defcending was amply repaid, having every year fincethat
time made vigorous fhoots. From the top of the wall to the furface of the earth,
thefe roots have not thrown out a fingle fibre ;
but are now united in a fmgle root.
Plants, when forced from their natural pofition, are endowed with a power to
reflore themfielves. A hop-plant, twilling round a flick, dire<5ts its courfe from
fouth to weft, as the fun does. Untwift it, and tie it in the oppofite diredlion ;
it
dies. Leave it loofe in the wrong dire6lion, it recovers its natural direction in a fingle
night. Twift a branch of a tree fo as to invert its leaves, and fix it in that pofition ;
if left in any degree loofe, it untwifts itfelf gradually, till the leaves be reftored to
their natural pofition. What better can an animal do for its welfare? A root of a
tree, meeting with a ditch in its progrefs, is laid open to the air. What follow s ? It
alters its courfe like a rational being; dips into the ground, undermines the ditch,
rifes on the oppofite fide to its wonted diftance from the furface, and then proceeds
in its original direction. Lay a wet fponge near a root laid open to the air ;
the root
will diredl its courfe to the fponge. Change the place of the fponge; the root varies
its diredtion. Put a pole into the ground at a moderate diftance from a fcandent
plant : the plant diredls its courfe to the pole, lays hold of it, and rifes on to its
natural height. A honeyfuckle proceeds in its courfe, till it be too long for fup-
porting its weight ;
and then ftrengthens itfelf by fhooting into a fpiral. If it meet
with another plant of the fame kind, they coalefce for mutual fupport; the one
fcrewing to the right, the other to the left. If a honeyfuckle-twig meets wdth a
dead branch, it fcrews from the right to the left. The clafpers of briony fhoot
into a fpiral, and lay hold of whatever comes in their w'ay for fupport. If, after
completing a fpiral of three rounds, they meet with nothing, they then try again
for further fupport, by altering their courfe.
By comparing thefe and other inftances of feeming voluntary motion in plants,,
with that ftiare of life wherewith fome of the inferior kinds of animals are endowed,
we can fcarcely hefitate in afcribing the fuperiority to the former; that is, putting
fenfation out of the queftion. Mufcles, for inftance, are fixed to one place, as
much as plants are ; nor have they any power of motion, befides that of opening
and fiiutting their ihells ;
and in this refpedt they have no fuperiority over the
motion of the fenfitive plant ;
nor doth their adlion difcover more fagacity, or even,
fo much, as the roots of the plane-tree, or the action of other vegetables..
M. Buffon, who feems to be delirous of confounding the animal and vegetable
kingdoms, denies fenfation to be any eflential diftindtion :
“ Senfation ( fays he)
more effentially diftinguifties animals from vegetables : but fenfation is a complex
idea^.
52 A KEY TO PHYSIC
idea, and requires fome explication. For if fenfation implied no more than
motion confequent upon a flroke or an impulfe, the fenfitive plant enjoys this
power. But if, by fenfation, we mean the faculty of perceiving and comparing
ideas, it is uncertain whether brute animals are endowed with it. If it fhould
be allowed to dogs, elephants, &c. whofe adtions feem to proceed from motives
fimilar to thofe by which men are actuated, it muft be denied to many fpecies
of animals, particularly to thofe which appear not to poffefs the faculty of
progreffive motion. If the fenfation of an oyfter, for example, differed only in
degree from that of a dog ;
why do we not afcribe the fame fenfation to vege-
tables, though in a degree ftill inferior? This diftindlion, therefore, between
the animal and vegetable, is neither fufficiently general nor determined. Hence
we are led to conclude that there is no abfolute and effential diftindtion between
the animal and vegetable kingdoms ;
but that nature proceeds, by imperceptible
degrees, from the moft perfedl to the moft imperfedl animal, and from that to the
vegetables ;
and the frefh-water polypus may be regarded as the laft of animals
and the flrft of plants.”
It were to be wifhed, that philofophers would on fome occafions confider, that
a fubjedt may be dark as well on account of their inability to fee, as when it really
affords no light. This great author boldly concludes, that there is no effential
difference between a plant and an animal, becaufe we afcribe fenfation to an
oyfler, and none to the fenfitive plant; but we ought to remember, that, though
we cannot perceive a diftindlion, it may neverthelefs exifl. Before M. Buffon,
therefore/had concluded in this manner, he ought to have proved that fome
vegetables were endowed with fenfation.
It is no doubt, however, as much incumbent on thofe who take the contrary fide
of the queflion, to prove that vegetables are not endowed with fenfation, as it was
incumbent on M. Buffon to prove that they are. But a little attention will ftiow us,
that the difficulty here proceeds entirely from our inability to fee the principle of
fenfation. We perceive this principle in ourfelves, but no man can perceive it in
another. Why then does every individual of mankind conclude, that his neighbour
has the fame fenfations with himfelf ? It can only be from analogy. Everyman
perceives his neighbour formed in a manner fimilar to himfelf;
he adts in a fimilar
manner on fimilar occafions, &c. Juft fo it is with brute animals. It is no more
doubtful that they have fenfations, than that we have them ourfelves. If a man is
wounded with a knife, for inftance, he expreffes a fenfe of pain and endeavours to
avoid a repetition of the injury. Wound a dog in the fame manner, he will alfo
exprefs a fenfe of pain ; and, if you offer to ftrike him again, will endeavour to
efcape,
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 53
efcape, before he feels the ftroke. To conclude here, that the adtion of the dog
proceeded from a principle different from that of the man, would be abfurd and
unphilofophical to the laft degree.
We mull farther take notice, that there are fenfations effentially diftindt from one
another ;
and in proportion as an animal is endowed with more or fewer of thefe
different fpecies, it is more or lefs perfect as an animal: but, as long as only one of
them remains, it makes not the leaft approach to the vegetable kingdom ;
and,
when they are all taken away, is fo far from becoming a vegetable, that it is only
a mafs of dead matter. The fenfes of a perfedt animal, for inflance, are five in
number. Take away one of them, fuppofe fight, he becomes then a lefs perfedt
animal; but is as unlike a vegetable as before. Suppofe him next deprived of hear-
ing, his refemblance to a vegetable would be as little as before; becaufe a vegeta-
ble can neither feel, tafte, nor fmell; and we fuppofe him ftill to enjoy thefe three
fenfes. Let us, laftly, fuppofe him endowed only with the fenfe of feeling, which
however feems to include that of tafte, and he is no more a vegetable than for-
merly, but only an imperfedt animal. If this fenfe is then taken away, we connedt
him not with the vegetable kingdom, but with what M. Buffon calls brute-matter.
It is to this kingdom, and not to the vegetable, that animals plainly approximate
as they defcend. Indeed, to fuppofe an approximation between the vegetable and
animal kingdoms, is very abfurd ;
for, at that rate, the moft imperfedt animal
ought to be the mofl perfedt plant: but we obferve no fuch thing. All animals,
from the higheft to the loweft, are polfelfed of vegetable life; and that, as far as
we can perceive, in an equal degree, whether the animal life is perfedt or imper-
fedt : nor doth there feem to be the fmallefl connedtion between the higheft de-
gree of vegetation and the loweft degree of fenfation. Though all animals are
poffeffed of vegetable life, thefe two feem to be as perfedtly diftindt and incom-
menfurate to one another, as any two things we can poftibly imagine.
The power of vegetation, for inftance, is as perfedt in an onion or leek, as in a
dog, an elephant, or a man : and yet, though you threaten a leek or an onion ever
fo much, it pays no regard to your words, as a dog would do : nor, though you
wound it, does it avoid a fecond ftroke. It is this principle of felf-prefervation in
animals, which, being the moll powerful one in their nature, is generally taken,
and with very good reafon, as the true charadteriftic of animal life. This principle
is undoubtedly a confequence of fenfation ;
and, as it is never obferved to take
place in vegetables, we have a right to fay that the foundation of it, namely, fen-
fation, belongs not to them. There is no animal, which makes any motion in con-
fequence of external irnpulfe where danger is threatened, but what puts itfelf in a
No. 4, P pofture
A KEY TO PHYSIC
54
pofture of defence; but no vegetable whatever does fo. A mufele, whon It is-
touched, immediately Ihuts its ihell; and, as this action puts it in a (late of de-
fence, we conclude that it proceeded from the principle of felf-prefervation. When
the fenfitive plant contracts from a touch, it is no more in a ftate of defence than
before; for whatever would have deftroyed it in its expanded ftate, will alfo do fo*
in its Contracted ftate. The motion of the fenfitive plant proceeds only from a cer-
tain property called irritability
;
and which, though our bodies poffefs it in an
eminent degree, is a charaCteriftic neither of animal nor vegetable life, but belongs
to us in common with brute-mattei\ It is certain, that an eleCtrified filk thread
ihows a much greater variety of motions than any fenfitive plant. If a bit of filk
thread is dropt on an electrified metal plate, it immediately ereCts itfelf; fpreads
out the fmall fibres like arms; and, if not detained, will fly off. If a finger is
brought near it, the thread feems greedily to catch at it. If a candle approaches,
It clafps clofe to the plate as if afraid of it. Why do we not conclude that the
thread in this cafe is really afraid of the candle? For this plain reafon, that its
feeming flight is not to get away from the candle, but to get towards the electrified
metal ; and, if allowed to remain there, will fuffer itfelf to be burnt without offer-
ing to ftir. The fenfitive plant, in like manner, after it has contracted, will fuffer
itfelf to be cut to pieces, without making the leaft effort to efcape. The cafe is not
fo with the meaneft animal. An hedge-hog, when alarmed, draws its body toge-
ther, and expands its prickles, thereby putting itfelf in a pofture of defence^
Throw it into water, and the fame principle of felf-prefervation prompts it’ to ex-
pand its body and fwim. A fnaiJ, when touched, withdraws itfelf into* its ihell,
but if a little quicklime is fprinkled upon it, fo that its ihell is no longer a place of
fafety, it is thrown into agonies, and endeavours to avail itfelf of its locomotive
power in order to efcape the danger. In mufcles and oyfters, indeed, we cannot
obferve this principle of felf-prefervation fo ftrongly, as nature has deprived them
of the power of progreflive motion : but, as we obferve them conftantly to ufe the.
means which nature has given them for felf-prefervation, we can have no reafon
to think that they are deftitute of that principle upon which it is founded.
But there is no need of arguments drawn from the inferior creation. We our-
felves are poiTeffed both of the animal and vegetable life, and certainly muft know
whether there is any connexion between vegetation and fenfation or not. We are
confcious that we exift; that we hear, fee, &c. but of our vegetation we are abfo-
lutely unconfcious. We feel a pleafure, for inftanee, in gratifying the calls of hun-
ger and thirft; but of the procefs by which our aliment improves our growth and
Tdgpur* we are altogether ignorant. If we, then, who are more perfect than other
vegetables,
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 55
vegetables, are utterly infenfible of our own vegetable life, why fliould we imagine
that the lefs perfect vegetables are fenfible of it?
To illuftrate our reafoning here by an example. The direction of the roots of the
plane-tree, mentioned above, Shows as much fagacity, if we are to look only to the
outward aCtion, as can be obferved in any motion of the moft perfect animal what-
ever ;
nevertheless, we have not the leaf!: fufpicion, either that the tree faw the
ground at a diftance, or that it was informed of its being there by the reft of its roots.
If a wound is made in the body of a man, and a lofs of fubftance is to be repaired,
the fame fagacity will be obferved in the arrangement of the fibres, not only as if
they were animated, but they will difpofe of themfelves Seemingly with a degree of
wifdom far Superior to what we have any idea of ;
yet this is done without our having
the leaft knowledge either how it is done, or of its being done at all. We have
therefore in ourfelves a demonstration, that vegetable life aCts without our knowing
what it does : and, if vegetables are ignorant of their moll Sagacious actions, why
Should we fufpeCt that we have a fenfation, let it be ever fo obfcure, of any of their
inferior ones, Such as contracting from a touch, turning towards the fun, or ad-
vancing to meet a pole ? Thus we may eafily give M. Buffoii a reafon why we
afcribe fenfation to an oyfter, and none to a vegetable ;
namely, becaufe we per-
ceive the vegetable to do nothing but what is alfo performed in our own bodies
without our having the leaft fenfation of it; whereas an oyfter puts itfelf in a de-
feniive pofture on the approach of danger ;
and, this being an aCtion fimilar to our
own upon a like occafion, we conclude that it proceeds from the fame principle of
fenfation. Here it may alfo be obferved, that, though the inferior animals are
deficient in the number, they are by no means fo in the acutenefs of their fenfa-
tion; on the contrary, though a mufcle or an oyfter is probably endowed with no
other fenfe than that of feeling, yet this fenfe is fo exquifite, that it will contract
upon the flighteft touch, fuch as we fliould altogether be infenfible of.
As to that power of contractility, or irritability, which is obferved in Some plants;
our folids have it, when deprived both of vegetable and animal life; for the human
heart, or a mufcle, cut out of an animal body, will continue to contract, if it is
irritated by pricking it, after it has neither fenfation nor vegetation.
A very good moral reafon may alfo be adduced, why vegetables are not endowed
with fenfation. Had they been fo, we may fuppofe them to fuffer pain when they
are cut or destroyed'; and, if fo, what an unhappy State muft they be in, who have
not the leaft power to avoid the injuries daily offered them ? In faCt, the goodnefs
of the Deity is very confpicuous in not giving to vegetables the fame fenfations as
to animals ;
and, as he hath given them no means of defence, though we had not
been
5G A KEY TO PHYSIC
been told it by himfelf, we might have known that he gave them for food to ani-
mals ;
and, in this cafe, to have endowed them with fenfation would have been
cruelty. Though animals without number prey upon one another, yet all of them
have fome means of defence; from whence wejuftly conclude, that their mutual de-
ftru£tion was not an original appointment of the Creator, but what followed from
the fall of Adam, and what he forefaw would happen in a courfe of time, and which
he therefore gave every one of them fome means of guarding againft. It may no
doubt be here objedled, that the giving fome means of felf-defence to every animal
cannot be reckoned a fufficient proof that it wr
as not the original defign ofthe Creator
that they lliould be deftroyed, feeing thefe means are not always effe6tual for their
prefervation. This objedtion, however, cannot be completely obviated without a
folution of the queftion concerning the origin of evil among the works of a per-
fe6lly-good Being. But, whatever difficulty there may be in folving this queftion,
It is certain, that, as fome means of felf-defence is given to every animal, it has
been the original defign of the Creator, that in all cafes one fpecies of animals fhould
not be deftroyed at the pleafure or vi ill of any other fpecies : and, as no means of
felf-defence is given to any vegetable, it is plain that they have been deftined for a
prey to every fpecies of animals that had accefs to them. Philofophers have infifted
much on the neceffity of one animal’s devouring another, that there might be room
fufficient for all; but this, fo far from being a fyftem worthy of the divine w'ifdom,
feems to be a reflexion upon it, as if the Author of Nature could not have found
means to preferve the life of one part of his creatures, without the deftrudfion and
mifery of the reft The facred writings leave us at no lofs to fee how' this carnivo-
rous difpofition came in; and in the next world, this piece of perfe6tion (as the
fanguinary philofophers above-mentioned would have it to be) feems to be left out;
for there, it is faid, “ They fhall not hurt nor deftroy; the lion fhall eat ftraw like
the ox; and there fhall be no more pain.” Ifa. xi. 7, 9- Rev. xxi. 4.
Of ANIMAL BLOWERS.
The grand argument for animal life in vegetables, w7
as inferred from the curious
conftru6tion of the frefh-water polypus, and the actinia genus, called animal flowers,
fea-anemone, fea-funfloM'er, &c. which, having indeed the external form and figure
of vegetables, with fcarcely any progreffive motion, might eafily deceive fuperficial
obfervers ;
but, when more minutely examined, the polypus, and all the adfinia
clafs, turn out to be abfolute animals, of the viviparous kind, and feed on flfh
;
the heads or mouths of which, when open, refemble a full-blown flower, whence
they
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 57
they are called ftower-fifh. There is one fpecies of them, in which the pureft white,
carmine, and ultramarine, are fcarcely fufficient to exprefs their brilliancy. The
bodies of fome of them are hemifpherical, of others cylindrical, and o^ others
fliaped like a fig. Their fubltance likewife differs ;
fome are Itiff and gelatinous,
others flellry and mufcular; but all of them are capable of altering their figure
when they extend their bodies and claws in fearch of food. They are found on
many of the rocky coalts of the Weft-India illands, and on fome parts of the coalt
of England. They have only one opening, which is in the centre of the uppermofl
part of the animal; round this are placed rows of flefhy claws ;
this opening is the
mouth of the animal, and is capable of great extenfion. The animals themfelves,
though exceedingly voracious, will bear long fafting. They may be preferved
alive a whole year, or perhaps longer, in a veffel of fea-water, without any vifible
food ; but, when food is prefented, one of them will fucceffively devour two
mufcles in their fhells, or even fwallow a w'hole crab as large as a hen’s egg. In
a day or two the' crab-fhell is voided at the mouth, perfectly cleared of all the
meat. The mufcle-fhells are likewife difcharged whole, with the fhells joined to-
gether, but entirely empty, fo that not the leafl particle of fifli is to be perceived
on opening them. An anemone of one fpecies will even fwallow an individual of
another fpecies; but, after retaining it ten or twelve hours, wall throw it up alive
and uninjured. Through this opening alfo it produces its young ones alive, already
furnifhed with little claws, which, as foon as they fix themfelves, they begin to
extend in fearch of food. One of the extremities of the fea-anemone exactly re_
fembles the outward leaves of that flower ;
while its limbs are not unlike the lhag
or inner part of it. By the other extremity it fixes itfelf, as by a fucker, to the
rocks or Itones lying in the fand; but it is not totally deprived of the power of
progreffive motion, as it can drift its lituation, though very flowly.
A peculiar fpecies of animal-flowers, called the cluftered animal-flower, has
been found in fome of the Weft-India illands, an account of which was publilhed
in the Philofophical Tranfa6lions, vol. lvii. by Mr. Ellis, in a letter to Lord Hill T-
borough. This compound animal, which is of a tender flellry fubltance, confiits
of many tubular bodies, fwelling gently towards the upper part, and ending like a
bulb or very fmall onion ;
on the top of each is its mouth, furrounded by one or
two rows of tentacles, or claws, which when contracted look like circles of beads.
The lower part of all thefe bodies has a communication with a firm flellry wrink-
led tube, which Iticks fait to the rocks, and fends forth other flellry tubes, which
creep along, them in various directions. Thefe are full of different fizes of thefe
No. 4. Q remarkable
A KEY TO PHYSIC

remarkable animals, which rife up irregularly in groups near to one another. .This
adhering tube, that fecures them fall to the rock, or fhelly bottom, is worthy of our
notice. The knobs are formed into feveral parts of it by its infinuating itfelf into
the inequalities of the coral rock, or by grafping pieces of fliells, part of which
ftill remain in it, with the flelhy fubftance grown over them. This fhows us the
inftimft of nature, that diredls thefe animals to preferve themfelves from the vio-
lence of the waves, not unlike the anchoring of mufcles by their fine filken fila-
ments that end in fuckers ;
or rather like the ilielly bafis of the ferpula, or worm-
fhell, the tree-oyfter, and the flipper barnacle, &c. whofe bafes conform to the
fhape of whatever fubftance they fix themfelves to, grafping it faft with their tefta-
ceous claws, to withftand the fury of a ftorm. When we view the infide of this
animal differed lengthwife, we find a little tube leading from the mouth to the fto-
mach, from whence there rife eight wrinkled fmall guts, in a circular order, with a
yellowifh foft fubftance in them ;
thefe bend over in the form of arches towards
the lower part of the bulb, whence they may be traced downwards, to the narrow
part of the upright tube, till they come to the flelhy adhering tube, where fome of
them may be perceived entering into the papilla, or the beginning of an animal of
the like kind, moft probably to convey it nouriihment till it is provided with claws;
the remaining part of thefe flender guts are continued on in the flefhy tube, with-
out doubt for the purpofe of producing and fupporting more young from the fame
common parent.
The Abb6 Dicquemarre, by many curious though cruel experiments, related in
the Phil. Tranf. for 1773, has fhown that thefe animals poffefs, in a moft extraor-
dinary degree, the power of reprodudtion ;
fo that fcarcely any thing more is ne-
ceffary to produce as many fea-anemones as we pleafe, than to cut a fingle one
into as many pieces. A fea-anemone being cut in two by a fe&ion through the
body, that part, where the limbs and mouth are placed, ate a piece of mufcle of-
fered to it foon after the operation, and continued to feed and grow daily for three
months after. The food fometimes paffed through the animal; but was generally
thrown up again, confiderably changed, as in the perfedl fea-anemone. In about
two months, two rows of limbs and a mouth were perceived growing out of the
part where the incifion was made. On offering food to this new mouth, it was
laid hold of and eaten ;
and, the limbs continually increafing, the animal gradu-
ally became as perfed as thofe which had never been cut. In fome inftances,
however, when one of thefe creatures was cut through, new limbs would be pro-
duced from the cut place, thofe at the mouth remaining as before ;
fo that a mon-
ftrous animal was the confequence, having two mouths, and feeding at both ends.

and forms a bafon, there is a fixed ftone, or piece of rock, in the middle, which is
always under water. Round its fides, at different depths, feldom exceeding
eighteen inches, are feen at all times of the year, iffuing out of little holes, cer-
tain fubfiances that have the appearance of fine radiated flowers, of a pale yellow,
or a bright ftraw colour, flightly tinged with green, having a circular border of
thick-fet petals, about the fize of, and much refembling, thofe of a Angle garden-
marigold, except that the whole of this feeming flower is narrower at the difcus, or
fetting-on of the leaves, than any flower of that kind. Mr. Hughes, in his Hiftory
of Barbadoes, gives the following curious account of them: “I have attempted to
pluck one of thefe animal-flowers from the rock to which they are fixed-; but
never could effeCt it; for, as foon as my fingers came within two or three inches of
it, it would immediately contract together its yellow border, and flirink back into
the hole of the rock ;
but, if left undifturbed for about four minutes, it would come
•gradually in fight, expanding, though at firfl very cautioufly, its feeming leaves,
till at laft it appeared in its former bloom. However, it would again recoil, with a
furprifing quicknefs, when my hand came within a fmall diftance of it. Having
tried the fame experiment by attempting to touch it with my cane, and a fmall
Render rod, the effeCt was the fame. But, though I could not by any means con-
trive to take or pluck one of thefe animals entire, yet I cut off (with a knife
which I had held for a long time out of fight, near the mouth of a hole out of which
one of thefe animals appeared) two of thefe feeming leaves. Thefe, when out of
the water, retain their fhape and colour ; but, being compofed of a membrane-
like fubftance, furprifingly thin, they foon flirivelled up, and decayed.” The
reproductive power of the Barbadoes animal-flower is prodigious. Many people
-coming to fee thefe ftrange creatures, and occafioning fome inconvenience to a
perfon through whofe grounds they were obliged to pafs, he refolved to deftroy
the objedt of their curiofity ;
and, that he might do fo effectually, he caufed all
the holes out of which they appeared, to be carefully bored and drilled with an
Ron infirument, fo that we cannot fuppofe but their bodies muft have been en-
tirely crufhed to a pulp : neverthelefs they again appeared in a few weeks in ftill
greater abundance, from the very fame places.
The fea-carnation, or animal-flower, found among the rocks at Haftings in Suf-
fex, is very fimilar to the animal-flower of Barbadoes. This animal adheres by its
tail, or fucker, to the under part of the projecting rocks oppofite the towm ;
and,
when the tide is out, has the appearance of a long white fig ; which is alfo the form
of it w'hen put into a glafs of fea-water.

60 A KEY TO PHYSIC
' Of the POLYPUS.
THE Polype, or Polypus, which fo long divided naturalifts in opinion whether
it was of vegetable or animal conformation, is a frefli- water animal, of the hydra
genus, in the clafs of worms, and order of zoophytes, in the Linnaean fyftera. It
is of a cylindrical figure, but variable, with very long tentacula, or claws. There
is fcarcely an animal in the world more difficult to defcribe, than this furprifing
worm; it varies its whole figure at pleafure, and is frequently found befet with
young in fuch a manner as to appear ramofe and divaricated ;
thefe young ones
adhering to it fo as to appear parts of its body.
When fimple and In a moderate ftate as to contraction or dilation, it is oblong,
*
{lender, pellucid, and of a pale-reddilh colour; its body is fomewhat fmaller to-
wards the tail, by which it fixes itfelf to fome folid body: and larger towards the
other extremity, where it has a larger opening, called its mouth, around which are
the tentacula, or claws, which are eight in number, and are ufually extended to
about half the length of its body. By means of thefe tentacula, or arms, as they are
commonly called, expanded into a circle of more than half a foot diameter, the crea-
ture feels every thing that can ferve it for food ;
and, feizing the prey with one of
them, calls in the afliftance of the others, if neceffary, to conduCt it to its mouth.
The produ&ion of its young is different from the common courfe of nature in
other animals ; for the young one iffues from the fide of its parent in the form of a
fmall pimple, which, lengthening every hour, becomes, in about two days, a perfeCt
animal, and drops from off its parent to fiiift for itfelf : but, before it does this, it
has often another growing from its fide ;
and fometimes a third from that, even
before the firft is feparated from its parent; and what is very extraordinary,
there has never yet been difeovered among them any diftinCtion of fex, or ap-
pearance of copulation; every individual of the whole fpecies being prolific, and
that as much if kept feparate as if fuffered to live among others ; but what is even
ftill more furprifing, is the reproduction of its feveral parts when cut off; for,
when cut into a number of feparate pieces, it becomes in a day or two fo many
diftinCl and feparate animals ;
each piece having the property of producing a head
and tail, and the other organs neceffary for life, and all the animal functions.
There is no diftinguillied place in the body of the polypus, from whence the
young are brought forth ;
for they fpring out like flioots or branches of a tree, from
all the exterior parts of their bodies. M. Trembley, who had heard much of this
creature, and being determined to convince himfelf, by real experiments, whether
it was a vegetable or an animal, cut one in the middle, when, to his utter amaze-
ment.

AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES.
ment, he found that in two days each of thofe pieces was become a perfedt animal,
the head-part having Ihot forth a tail, and the tail a head. Numerous trials of a
fimilar nature have been made in my own laboratory; and I have always found
that it is of no confequence how often you cut them, for they Hill put out new
members, and become fo many diftimft polypes.
They are always to be found in clear flowly-running waters, adhering by the tail
to ilicks, Hones, and water-plants, and live on fmall infe&s. They are ealily kept
alive a long time in glaffes, often changing the water, keeping the glaffes clean,
and feeding them with a fmall red w-orm, common in the mud of the Thames, or
with other fmall infedts. The creature has its name from the Greek no\w;, many,
and wav?, a foot, fignifying an animal with many feet; but a more appofite one might
eafily have been invented, fince it has in reality no feet at all. What were originally
taken for feet, are what have fince been called its horns, and of late more properly
its arms, their office being to catch its prey. With thefe little arms, which are
capable of great extenfion, it feizes minute worms, and various kinds of water-in-
fe<fts, and brings them to its mouth : and, like the lea-anemone, often fwallows
bodies larger than itfelf : having a furpriling property of extending its mouth wider,
in proportion, than any other animal. After its food is digefted in its ftomach, it
returns the remains of the animals upon which it feeds through its mouth again,
having no other obfervable emundtory. In a few days there appear fmall knobs or
papillae on its fides; as thefe iticreafe in length, little fibres are feen rifing out of
the circumference of their heads, as in the parent animal; which fibres they foon
begin to ufe for the purpofe of procuring nourilliment, &c. When thefe are ar-
rived at mature fize, they fend out other young ones on their fides in the fame man-
ner ;
fo that the animal branches out into a numerous offspring, grow ing out of
one common parent, and united together and difpofed in the manner reprefented in
the annexed plate. Each of thefe provides nourilliment not only for itfelf, but for
the whole fociety; an increafe of the bulk of one polype, by its feeding, tending
to an increafe in the reft. Thus a polype of the frelh-water kind becomes like a
plant branched out, or compofed of many bodies, each of which has this fingular
eharafteriftic, that, if one of them be cut in two in the middle, the feparated part
becomes a .complete animal, and foon, adhering to fome fixed bafe, like the parent
from which it was feparated, produces a circle of arms; a mouth is formed in the
centre; it increafes in bulk, emits a numerous progeny, and is foon, in every re-
fpe6t, as perfeft an animal as that from which it was fevered.
The feveral ftrange properties recorded of the polypes and animal flowers, though
very furprifing, are not, however, peculiar to them alone. The Surinam toad is well

known to produce its young, not in the ordinary way, but in cells upon its back.
And, as to the moft amazing of their properties, the re-produdlion of their parts,
we know the crab and lobfter, if a leg be broken off, can always produce a new one.
I have annexed a copper-plate of fome excellent drawings of thefe curious phe-
nomena in nature ;
in which No. 1 reprefents the freih water polype, with its ten-
tacula or arms extended upwards. No. 2 reprefents the fame animal, with its
young branching from it, and putting out their claws for food, which, howfoever
taken, goes to the common fupport of the whole family. No. 3 fliows the animal
carnation-flower of the rocks near Haftings in Suffex, with its tentacles extended
in fearch of food. No. 4 is an exa<5t reprefentation of the fea-anemone, above
defcribed. No. 5 fliows the head of the animal-flower of Barbadoes. No. 6 is
a brilliant difplay of the fea fun-flower animal, with its innumerable tentacles ex-
panded to catch its prey, which being allured to it by its elegant appearance, they
clofe inftantly upon it, and convey it to the interior concavity or mouth. No. 7
reprefents a clufter of the animal-flower defcribed by Mr. Ellis, in the iflands ceded
by France; in which a fliows one of the animals ftretching out its tentacles in fearch
of food. No. 8 is a perpendicular diffedtion of one of the fame animals, in order to
fliovv the gullet, inteftines, ffomach, and the fibres or tendons that move the claws.
Of ANIMALCULES.
THE next moft furprifing part of animal nature, is that of animalcules, an innu-
merable tribe of living beings, wholly invifible to the naked eye, and which cannot
even be perceived to exift, but by the afiiftance of microfcopes. The fmalleft
living creatures our inftruments can ftiow, are thofe that inhabit the w’aters ;
for,
though poflibly animalcules equally minute, or perhaps more fo, may fly in the
air, or creep upon the earth, it is fcarcely poffible to bring fuch under our exami-
nation;' but, water being tranfparent, and confining the creatures in it, we are able,
by applying a drop of it to our glaffes, to difeover, to a certain degree of fmallnefs,
all that it contains.—Some of the moft curious of thefe animalcules, which have
been defcribed by microfcopical obfervers, are as follow.
3. The Hair-like InjeB. This is fo called on account of its fliape; being ex-
tremely flender, and frequently an hundred and fifty times as long as broad. The
body or middle part, which is nearly ftraight, appears, in fome, compofed of fuch
rings as the windpipe of land-animals; but, in others, feems rather fealed, or made
up of rings that obliquely crofs one another. Its two ends are hooked or bent, pretty
nearly in the fame degree, but in a direction oppofite to one another ;
and, as no eyes
can
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 63
can be difcerned, it is difficult to judge which is the head or tail. Its progreffive
motion is very lingular, being performed by turning upon one end as a centre, and
defcribing almbft a quarter of a circle with the other; its fhape and form may be
feen greatly magnified in the following curious Plate of Animalcules, at fig. 1. Its
motions are very flow, and require much patience and attention in the obfcrver.
Thefe creatures are fo fmall, that millions of millions of them might be contained
in the circle, fig. 2. When viewed fingly, they are exceedingly tranfparpnt, and
of a beautiful green colour; but, when numbers of them are brought together, they
become opaque, lofe their green colour, and grow entirely black. The hair-like
infedt was firft difeovered in a ditch at Norwich, one end of which communicates
with the river there, and the other end with a fecond ditch, into which feveral
kennels empty themfelves. The length of this ditch was at leaft a hundred yards,
and its breadth nine. The bottom, for more than a foot thick, was covered with a
blackifh green fubftance in appearance like mud, made up for the moft part of
thefe infedts ; but, fuppofmg only half or a quarter part of it to be compofed of
them, according to the above dimenfions, their numbers muft exceed all imagination.
2. Eds in Pojte, &c. When pafte is allowed to ftand till it becomes four, it is
then found to be the habitation of numberlefs animalcules, which may be difcerned
by the naked eye ;
and, though their form cannot be perfedtly diftinguifhed, their
motion is very perceptible, and the w’hole pafte w ill feem to be animated. Fig, 3
reprefents one of thefe anguilloe highly magnified. The moft remarkable property
of thefe infedts is, that they are viviparous. If one of them is cut through near
the middle, feveral oval bodies, of different fizes, will be feen to iffue forth. Thefe
are young anguillas, each of them coiled up and inclofed in its proper membrane,
which is fo exquifttely fine, as fcarce to be difcernible by the greateft magnifier,
while it inclofes the embryo animal. The*largeft and moft forward immediately
break through this covering, unfold themfelves, and w'riggle about in the water
nimbly; others get out, uncoil, and move themfelves about more flowly; and the
leaft mature continue entirely without motion. The uterus, or veffel that contains
all thefe oval bodies, is compofed •of many ringlets, not unlike the afpera arteria
of land-animals, and feems to be confiderably elaftic ;
for, as foon as the animal-
cule is cut in two, the oval bodies are thruft out with fome degree of violence, from
the fpringing-back or adlion of this bowel. An hundred and upwards of the young
ones have been feen to iffue from the body of one fingle eel, whereby the prodi-
gious increafe of them may be acounted for; as probably feveral fuch numerous
generations are produced in a fhorttime. Animalcules of a fimilar kind are like-
wife found in vinegar ;
and, like thofe already deferibed, are found to be vivipa-
rous. But it is not only in acid matters that fuch appearances are obferved. In
fome
64 A KEY TO PHYSIC
fome fields of wheat, many grains maybe obferved, that appear blackilh outwardly,
as iffcorched; but when opened, are found to contain a foft white fubftance, which,
attentively confidered, appears to be nothing elfe than a congeries of threads or
fibres, lying clofe to each other in a parallel diredtion, much refembling the unripe
down of fome thirties on cutting open the flower-heads before they begin to blow.
This fibrous matter difcovers not the leaft fign of life or motion, unlefs water is
applied : but immediately on wetting, provided the grains of wheat have been
newly gathered, the fuppofed fibres feparate, and appear to be living creatures.
Their motions at firft are very languid ;
but gradually become more active and vi-
gorous, twifting and wriggling themfelvcs fomewhat in the manner of the eels in
parte, but always flower and with lefs regularity.
3. The Proteus, fo called on account of its artuming a great number of different
fhapes, fo as fcarcely to be known as the fame animal in its various transformations;
and indeed, unlefs it be carefully watched while parting from one fhape to another,
it will often become fuddenly invirtble. When water, wherein any fort of vegetable
has been infufed, or animals preferved, has ftood quietly for fome days or weeks
in any glafs or other veflel, a flimy fubltance will be collected about the fides: fome
of which being taken up with the point of a pen-knife, placed on a flip of glafs in a
drop of water, and looked at through the microfcope, will be found to harbour fe-
veral kinds of little animals that are feldom found fwimming about at large ;
among
which the proteus is one. Its fhape is better underftood from the following plate,
than from any defcription that could be given. Its fubftance and colour re-
femblethatof a fnail; and its whole fhape feems to bear a confiderable refemblance
to that of a fwan. It fwims to and fro wdth great vivacity: but will now and then
flop for a minute or two; during which time its long neck is ufually employed as far
as it can reach, fonvards, and on every fide, with a fomewhat-flow but equable mo-
tion, like that of a fnake, frequently extending thrice the length of its body, and feem-
ingly in fearch of food. There are no eyes, nor any opening in the head like a mouth,
to be difcerned: but its adtions plainly prove it to be an animal that can fee; for,
though multitudes of different animalcules fwim about in the fame water, and its
own progrefrtve motion is very fwift, it never ftrikes againftany of them, but diredts
its courfe between them with a dexterity wholly unaccountable fhould w^e fuppofe it
deftitute of fight. When it is alarmed, it fuddenly draws in its neck, reprefentedin the
Plate at fig. 4 and 5. transforming itfelf into the fhape reprefented at fig. 6. when it
becomes more opaque, and moves about very flowly, with the large and foremoft.
When it has continued fome time in this pofture, it will often, inftead of the head
and neck it had formerly, put forth a new one, with a kind of w'heel-machinery,

represented at fig. 7. the motions of which draw a current of water to it from a con-
siderable didance. Having often pulled in and thrud out this fhort head, Sometimes
with and Sometimes without the wheel-work, the creature, as if weary, will remain
motionlefs for a Avhile ;
then its head and long neck will be very (lowly protruded,
as at fig. 8. and it foon refumes its former agility. Sometimes it difpofes of its neck
and head as reprefented at fig. 9.
4. The Wheel-animal,
or Vorticella. This wonderful animalcule is found in rain-
water that has Stood fome days in leaden gutters, or in hollows of lead on the tops
of houfes, or in the (lime or Sediment left by fuch water ;
and perhaps may alfo be
found in other places; but, if the water (landing in gutters of lead, or the Sediment
left behind it, has any thing of a red colour in it, one may be almofl certain of
finding them therein. Though it difcovers no Signs of life except when in the wa-
ter, yet it is capable of continuing alive for many months after it is taken out of
the water, and kept in a (late as dry as dud. In this (late it is of a gobular lhape,
exceeds not the bignefs of a grain of Sand, and no Signs of life appear; but, being
put into water, in the Space of half an hour a languid motion begins, the globule
turns itlelf about, lengthens itfelf by (low degrees, aflfumes the form of a lively
maggot, and mod commonly in a few minutes afterwards puts out its wheels
;
Swimming vigoroudy through the water, as if in Search of food; or elfe, fixing
itfelf by the tail, works the wheels in fuch a manner as to bring its food to it.' Fig.
10, 11, 12, and 13, (how the different appearances of its wheels; and fig. 14, and 15,
-Show its globular form. The mod remarkable part of this animalcule is its wheel-
work. This confids of a couple of Semicircular indruments, round the edges of
which many little fibrillae move themfelves very brifkly, fometimes with a kind of
rotation, and fometimes in a trembling or vibrating manner. When in this date,
it fometimes unfadens its tail, and fwims along with a great deal of fwiftnefs, Seem-
ingly in purfuit of its prey. Sometimes the wheels feem to be entire circles, armed
with fmall teeth, like thofe of the balance-wheel of a watch, appearing projected
forwards beyond the head, and extending tideways fomewhat wider than its diame-
ter. The teeth or cogs of thefe wheels feem to Stand very regularly at equal dis-
tances ;
but the figure of them varies according to their pofition, the degree of their
protrufion, and perhaps the will of the animal itfelf. All the adtions of this crea-
ture feem to imply fagacity and quicknefs of fenfation. At the lead touch or mo-
tion in the water, they indantly draw in their wheels ;
and their eyes feem to be
lodged fomewhere about the wheels ;
becaufe, while in the maggot date, its mo-
tions are (low and blundering; but, after the wheels are protruded, they are per-
formed with great regularity, fwiftnefs, and deadinefs.
No. 5. S Befides
66 A KEY TO PHYSIC
Beftdes the above, there are found in our waters feveral other fpecies of animals
furnished with wheels, fome of which appear to have a rotatory, and others a vi-
bratory, motion. Fig. Id. represents a kind found in the ditch at Norwich, where
the hair-like infedf is produced. They differ from the foregoing only in having
very long tails. Fig. 17, 18, and 19, reprefent a fpecies of wheel animals, which
are alfo covered with Shells. The body of this fpecies conflfts of thrde parts, in
like manner as the other; only the thorax and abdomen, in this, are not Separated
by any gut, or intermediate veil'd, but are joined immediately together. The heart
is plainly perceived, having a regular fy Stole and diaftole, at a a a, as in the former
fpecies. Thefe creatures occasionally draw themfelves entirely within their Shells;
and the Shell then appears terminated by Six Short Spikes on one fide and two on the
other. The young ones of this fpecies are carried in oval facculi, or integuments,
faftened externally to the lower part of their Shells Somewhere about the tail. When
a young one is about to burft its integuments, the parent affifts it greatly, by wag-
ging its tail, and Striking the oval bag, So that the young one’s head becomes as it
were forced into the water, though the tail cannot be So Soon difengaged. In this
condition the young one Sets its wheel a-going, and exerts all its endeavours to free
itfelf from its confinement. When it has got clear, it Swims away, wagging its
tail as the old one does, and leaving the integument adhering to the Shell of the
parent. Thefe wheel-animals are great tormentors of the water-flea, of which a
figure is given in the plate. Fig. 20. Shows it magnified, with fome of the wheel-
animals adhering to it; fig. 21. Shows the natural Size of the flea. Thefe infedls
are often found in great numbers in the Same water ;
and, when that is the cafe,
it is not uncommon to difcover five or Six of thefe cruftaceous wheel-animals faft-
ened by their tail to the Shell or horns of the flea : cauftng it, Seemingly, a vaft deal
of unealinefs ;
nor can they be driven away, or Shaken off, by all the efforts the
flea can ufe for that purpofe.
5. The Bell-Jlower Animal, or Plumed Polype. Thefe animalcules dwell in colo-
nies together, from ten to fifteen, (Seldom falling Short of the former number, or
exceeding the latter,) in a flimy kind of mucilaginous or gelatinous cafe ;
which
out of the water has no determined form, appearing like a little lump of Slime;
but, when expanded therein, has fome refemblance to the figure of a bell with its
mouth upwards ;
and is ufually about half an inch long and a quarter of an inch in
diameter. Thefe bells, or colonies, are to be found adhering to the large leaves of
duckweed, and other aquatic plants. They may be moft eafily difcovered by let-
ting a quantity of water, with duckweed in it, Hand quietly for three or four hours
in glafs veffels in a window, or other place where a Strong light comes ; for then,
if
67
AND THE dCCULT SCIENCES.
if any are about the duckweed, they will be found, on careful infpeCtion, extending
themfelves out of their cafes, and making an elegant appearance. Befides the par-
ticular and feparate motion which each of thefe creatures is able to exert within its
own cafe, and independent of the reft; the whole colony together has a power of
altering the pofttion of the bell, or even of removing it from one place to another ;
and hence this bell is fometiines found Handing perfectly upright, as at fig. 22. and
fometimes bending the upper part downwards. As thefe animalcules feem not to
choofe to ftay together in focieties whofe number exceeds fifteen, when the colony
happens to increafe in number, the bell may be obferved to fplit gradually, begin-
ning from about the middle of the upper or anterior extremity, and proceeding
downwards towards the bottom, as at fig. S3, till they at laft feparate entirely, and
become two complete colonies independent of each other, one of which fometimes
removes to another part of the vefiel. The arms of each individual of this colony
are fet round the head, to the number of forty, having each the figure of an Italic /,
one of whofe hooked ends is fattened to the head, and all together, when expand-
ed, compofe a figure fhaped fomewhat like a horfe’s Ihoe, convex on one fide next
the body, but gradually opening and turning outwards, fo as to leave a confidera-
ble area within the outer extremities of the arms. When the arms are thus extend-
ed, the creature, by giving them a vibrating motion, can produce a current in the
water, which brings the animalcules, or whatever other minute bodies are within
the fpliere of its action, with great velocity to its mouth, fituated between the arms;
where they are taken in if liked, or driven away by a contrary motion. Though
their eyes cannot be difcovered, yet they have perception of the light: for, when
kept in the dark, they always remain contracted ;
but, on being expofed to the
light of the fun or of a candle, they conftantly extend their arms, and fhow evident
figns of being pleafed.
6. The Globe-animal. This animalcule, reprefented at fig. 24. feems exaCtly glo-
bular, having no appearance of either head, tail, or fins. It moves in all directions,
forwards or backwards, up or down, either rolling over and over like a bowl, fpin-
ning horizontally like a top, or gliding along fmoothly without turning itfelf at all.
Sometimes its motions are flow, at other times very fwift ;
and, when it pleafes,
it can turn round, as it were upon an axis, very nimbly, without removing out of
its place. The whole body is tranfparent, except where the circular black lpots
are fhown in the figure. Some of the animals have no lpots, and others from one
to feven. The l'urface of the whole body appears, in fome, as if all over dotted
with points ;
in others, as if granulated like fhagreen : but their more general ap-
pearance is, as if befet thinly round with fliort moveable hairs or briftles, which
probably
<53 A KEY TO PHYSIC
probably are the inftruments by which their motions are performed. Thefe ani-
malcules may be feen by the naked eye, but appear only like moving points.
/. The Pipe-animal. Thefe creatures are found on the coaft of Norfolk, living
in final 1 tubes or cafes of fandy matter, in fuch multitudes as to compofe a mafs
fometimes of three feet in length, fig- 25. fhows a piece of fuch a congeries broke
off, where aaaa reprefent the mouths or openings of the pipes wherein the little
animals make their abode. Fig. 26. fhows one fingle pipe, with its inhabitant, fepa-
rated from the reft, and magnified nine or ten times in diameter. The pipe or cafe
h is made of fand, intermixed here and there with minute fliells, and all cemented
together by a glutinous dime, probably ifluing from the animal’s own body c, which
is compofed ofmufcular ringlets like thofe of a worm, capable of great extenfion or
contraction. The anterior end or head, d, is exceedingly beautiful, having round it
a double row of little arms dilpofed in a very regular order, and probably capable
of extenfion, in order to catch its food, aud bring it to its mouth. Some of thefe
tubes are found petrified.
8. An Infect with net-like arms. The properties and lliape of this little animal
are very extraordinary. It is found only in cafcades, where the w ater runs very fwift.
There thefe infeCts are found in clutters, ftanding ereCt on their tails; and refem-
bling, when all together, the combs of bees at the time they are filled with their
aurelias. On being taken out of the water, they fpin threads, by which they hang
exactly in the fame manfier as the garden-fpider. Fig. 27. fhows one of thefe infeCts
magnified. Its body appears curioufly turned as on a lathe; and at the tail are
three fharp fpines, on which it raifes itfelf, and ftands upright in the water: but
the moft curious apparatus is about its head, where it is furnifhed with two inftru-
ments like fans or nets, which ferve to provide its food. Thefe it frequently fpreads
out and draws in again ;
and when drawn up they are folded together with the ut-
moft nicety and exaCtnefs, fo as to be indifee rnible when brought clofe to the body.
At the bottom of thefe fans a couple of claws are fattened to the lower part of the
head, which, every time the nets are drawn in, conduCt to the mouth of the ani-
mal whatever is taken in them. Some of thefe creatures being kept with water
in a vial, moft of them died in two days ;
and the reft, having fpun themfelves
tranfparent cafes, ( which were fattened either to the fides of the glafs, or to pieces
of grafs put into it,) teemed to be changed into a kind of chryfalis. None ofthem
lived above three days ;
and, though freth water was given them twr
o or three
times a-day, yet in a few hours it would ftink to a degree fcarcely conceivable, and
that too at leveral yards diftance, though, in proportion to the water, all the in-
cluded infeCts were not more than as one to one million one hundred and fifty thou-
fand.

fand. This makes it probable, that it is neceffary for them to live in a rapid dream,
left they fhould be poifoned by the effluvia ilfuing from their own bodies, as no
doubt they were in the phial.
9. A curious aquatic worm. This animalcule is fhown, magnified, at fig. 28.
It is found in ditch -water, and is of various fizes, from one fortieth to half an inch
in length. About the head it has fomewhatof a yellowifh colour; but all the reft
of the body is perfedtly colourlefs and tranfparent, except the inteflines, which are
confiderably opaque, and difpofed as in the figure. Along its fides are feveral
papillae, with long hairs growing from them: it has two black eyes, and is very
nimble. But the mod remarkable thing in this creature, is a long horn or probofcis ;
which, in the large ones, may be feen with the naked eye, if the water is clear, and
is fornetimes one tenth of an inch in length ;
this it waves to and fro as it moves
in the water, or creeps up the fide of the glafs; but it is not known whether it is
hollow, or of what ufe it is to the creature itfelf.
10. Spermatic Animals and Animalcula Infuforia. The difcovery of living ani-
malcules in the femen of mod animals, is claimed by Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch natu-
turalid. According to this naturalid, thefe animalcules are found in the male feed
of every kind of animal ;
but their general appearance is very much the fame, nor
doth their fize differ in proportion to the bulk of the animal to which they belong.
The bodies of all of them feem to be of an oblong oval form, with long tapering
dender tails iffuing from them: and, as by this fhape they refemble tadpoles, they
have been frequently called by that name; though the tails of them, in proportion
to their bodies, are much longer than the tails of tadpoles are: and it is obfervable,
that the animalcules in the feed of fifties have tails much longer and more dender
than the tails of thofe in other animals; infomuch, that the extremity of them is
not to be difcerned without the bed glades, and the utmod attention. Fig. 29, a,
b, c, d, reprefentthe fpermatic animalcula of the rabbit; and fig. 30, e,f, g, h, thofe
found in the feed of a dog. The numbers of thefe animalcula are inconceivable.
On viewing with a microfcope the milt or feed of a male cod-fidi, innumerable
multitudes of animalcules are found therein, of fuch a diminutive fize, that at lead
ten thoufand of them are capable of being contained in the bulk of a grain of fand;
whence it is concluded, that the milt of this fingle fiih contained more living ani-
malcules than there are to be found people living in the whole world.. To find the
comparative fize of thefe animalcules, Mr. Leeuwenhoek placed a hair of his head
near them; which hair, through his microfcope, appeared an inch in breadth; and
he was fatisfied, that at lead fixty fuch animalcules could eafily lie within that dia-
meter; whence, their bodies being fpherical, it follows, that two hundred and fix-
No. 5. T teen
70 A KEY TO PHYSIC
teen thoufand of them are but equal to a globe whofe diameter is the breadth of a
hair. He obferved, that, when the W'ater wherewith he had diluted the feed of a
cod-fifh was exhaled, the little bodies of the animalcules burft in pieces ;
which did
not happen to thofe in the feed of a ram: and this is imputed to the greater firmnefs
and confidently of the latter, as the fleih of a land-animal is more compadi than fifli.
Thefe animalcules appear to be very vigorous and tenacious of life; for they may
be obferved to move long after the animal from which they are taken is dead. They
have this peculiarity alfo, that they are continually in motion, w ithout the leaft reft
or intermiffion, provided there is fluid fufficient for them to fwirn about in. Thefe
animalcules are only peculiar to the feed; nothing that has the leaft token of life
being difcoverable by the heft glaffes, either in the blood, fpittle, urine, gall, or
chyle. Great numbers, however, are to be found in the whitifh matter that flicks
between our teeth; fome of which are of an oval figure, and others refetnble eels*
The Animalcula Infufaria take their name from their being found in all kinds
either of vegetable or animal infufions. Indeed, there is fcarcely any kind of water,
unlefs impregnated with fome mineral fubftance, but what will difeover living
creatures. Leeuwenhoek fays, that at firft he could difeern no living creatures in
rain-wr
ater; but, after Handing fome days, he difeovered innumerable animalcules*
many thoufands of times lefs than a grain of fand, and in proportion to a mite as
a bee is to a horfe. In other rain-w'ater, which had likewife flood fome time, he
found the fmalleft fort he had ever feen; and, in a few' days more,, met with others
eight times as big as thefe, and almoft round. In another quantity of rain-w ater,,
that had been expofed like the former, he difeovered a kind of animalcules w itht
two little horns, in continual motion. The fpace between the horns was flat,,
though the body was roundifh, but tapering a little towards the end; where a tail
appeared, four times as long as the body, and the thicknefs of a fpider’s wr
eb.
He obferved feveral hundreds of thefe w ithin the fpace a grain of fand would oc-
cupy. If they happened on the leaft filament or fixing, they were entangled in it;
and then would extend their bodies into an oblong round, and ftruggle hard to-
difengage their tails. He obferved a fecond fort, of an oval figure, and imagined
the head to ftand at the fharpeft end. The body was flat, with feveral fmali feet,
moving exceeding quick, but not difcernible without a great deal of attention.
Sometimes they changed their ihape into a perfect round, efpecially when the water-
began to dry away. He met alfo with a third fort, twice as long as broad, and.
eight times fmaller than the firft
:
yet in thefe he dilcerned little feet, whereby they,
moved very nimbly. He perceived likewife a fourth fort, a thoufand times fmaller
than. a loufe's eye, and which exceeded all the reft in brifknefs : he found thefe-
r

AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 71
turning themfelves round, as it were upon a point, with the celerity of a top. And
he fays, there were feveral other forts. The production of animalculainfuforia is-
very furprifing.. In four hours time, an infufion of cantharides has produced ani-
malcula lefs than even the tails of the fpermatic animals we have already defcribed.
Neither do they feem to be fubjeCb to the fate of other animals; but, feveral kinds
of them at lead, by dividing themfelves in two, to enjoy a fort of immortality. Nor
do the common methods by which other animals are dedroyed, feem to be effectual
for dedroying their vital principle. Hot mutton-gravy, fecured in a phial with a
cork, and afterwards fet among hot aflies, to deftroy as effectually as poffible every
living creature that could be fuppofed to exift in it, has neverthelefs been found
fvvarming with animalcules, after ftanding a few days. In the Philofophical Tranf-
a.Ctions, vol. lix. we have a very curious account, given us by Mr. Ellis, of animal-
cules produced from an infufion of potatoes and of hemp-feed.
“On the 25th of May, 1768, Fahrenheit’s thermometer feventy degrees, I boiled
a potatoe in the New-River water, till it was reduced to a- mealy confidence. I
put part of it, with an equal proportion of the boiling liquor, into a cylindrical
glafs veffel, that held fomething lefs than half a wine pint, and covered it clofe
immediately with a glafs cover. At the fame time I diced an unboiled potatoe,
and, as near as I could judge, put the fame quantity into a glafs veffel of the fame
kind ;
with the dime proportion of New-River water not boiled ;
and covered it
with a glafs cover; and placed both veffels clofe to each other. On the tvventy-
dxth of May, twenty-four hours afterwards, I examined a fmall drop of each, by
the firll magnifier of Wilfon’s nricrofcope, whofe focal diftance is reckoned at the
fiftieth part of an inch ;
and, to my amazement, they were both full of animalcules
of a linear fliape, very didinguilliable, moving to and fro with great celerity; fo
that there appeared to be more particles of animal than vegetable life in each drop.
T liis experiment I have repeatedly, tried, and always found it to fucceed in pro-*
portion to the heat of the circumambient air; fo that even in winter,. if the liquors
are kept properly warm, at lead in two or three days the experiment will fucceedf
What I have obferved are infinitely fmaller than fpermatic animals, and of a very
different fhape: the truth of which every accurate obferver will foon be convinced
of, whofe curiofity may lead him to compare them; and I am perfuaded he will
find they are no way akin. At prefent I fliall pafs over many other curious ob-
fervations, which I have made on two years experiments, in order to proceed to
the explaining a hint which 1 received lad. January from M. de Sauffure, of Geneva,’
when he was here; which is, that he found one kind of thefe animalculainfuforia
that increafe by dividing acrofs into nearly two equal parts. I had often feen this

appearance in various fpecies a year or two ago, as I found upon looking over the
minutes I had taken when I made any new obfervation; but always fuppofed the
animal, when in this ftate, to be in coition. Not hearing, till after M. de Sauflure
left this kingdom, from what infufion he had made his obfervation, his friend
Dr. de la Roche, of Geneva, informed me, the latter end of February iaft, that
it was from hemp-feed. I immediately procured hemp-feed from different feed s-
men, in diftant parts of the town. Some of it I put into New-River water*, fome
into diftilled water, and fome I put into very hard pump water. The refult was,
that in proportion to the heat of the weather, or the warmth in which they were
kept, there was an appearance of millions of minute animalcula in all the infufions;
and, fome time after, fome oval ones made their appearance. Thefe were much
larger than the fir ft, which ftill continued; they wriggled to and l'ro in an undu-
latory motion, turning themfelves round very quick all the time that they moved
forwards. Nothing more plainly fliows thefe animals to be zoophytes than this
circumftance; that when, by accident, the extremity of their bodies has been fhri-
velled for want of a fupply of frefh water, the applying more frefh water has given
motion to the part of the animal that was ftill alive; by which means, this lhapelefs
figure has continued to live and fwim to and fro all the time it was fupplied with
frefh water.”—Thus we have given as full an account as our limits would admit, of
the moft curious kind of animalcules that have hitherto been obferved. We can-
not, however, difrnifs this fubjedt, without taking notice of the animalcules found
in the feed of man.
Before the invention of microfcopes, the do6trine of equivocal generation, both
with regard to animals and plants of fome kinds, was univerfally received : but this
inftrument foon convinced every intelligent perfon, that thofe plants which for-
merly were fuppofed to be produced by equivocal generation, arofe from feeds;
and the animals, in like manner, from a male and female. But, as the microfcope
threw light upon one part of nature, it left another involved in darknefs: for the
origin of the animalcula infuforia, or of the fpermatic animals already mentioned,
remains as much unknown, as that of many other kinds was, when the dodlrineof
equivocal generation reigned in full force.
The difeovery ot fpermatic animalcules was thought to throw fome light on the
myfterious affair of generation itfclf, and thefe minute creatures were imagined to
be each of them individuals of the fame fpecies with the parent. Here the infinite
number of thefe animalcules was an objection, and the difficulty remained as great
as before; for, as every one of thefe animalcules behoved to be produced from a
male and female, to explain their origin by animalcular generation in the fame
manner,
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 73
manner, was only explaining generation by itfelf. This hypothecs, therefore, hav-
ing proved unfatisfaCtory, others have been invented, but which are likewife in-
volved in doubt. M. Buflfon, however, fo far as concerns human generation, has
given fuch a particular account of the animalcules in the feed of man, that we fliall
hate it here, for the information of the curious.
Having procured the private parts of a man who died a violent death, he extract-
ed all the feed from them while they were hill warm: and having examined a drop
of it with a double microfcope, it had the appearance as in the Plate, at fig. 31.
Large filaments appeared, which in fome places fpread out into branches, and in
others intermingled with one another. Thefe filaments clearly appeared to be agi-
tated by an internal undulatory motion, like hollow tubes which contained fome
moving fubftance. He faw diftinCtly this appearance changed for that at fig. 32.
Two of thefe filaments, which were joined longitudinally, gradually feparated from
each other in the middle, alternately approaching and receding, like two tenfe cords
fixed by the ends, and drawn afunder in the middle. Thefe filaments were com-
pofed of globules that touched one another, and refembled a chaplet of beads.
After this, he obferved the filaments fwelled in feveral places, and perceived fmall
globular bodies ilfue from the fwelled parts, which had a vibratory motion like a
pendulum. Thefe fmall bodies were attached to the filaments by fmall threads,
which gradually lengthened as the bodies moved. At laft, the fmall bodies detached
themfelves entirely from the filaments, drawing after them the fmall thread, which
looked like a tail. When a drop of the feminal liquor was diluted, thefe fmall bo-
dies moved in all directions very brifkly. The feminal matter was at firft too thick,
but gradually became more fluid; and, in proportion as its fluidity increafed, the
filaments difappeared, but the fmall bodies became exceedingly numerous. Each
of them had a long thread or tail attached to it, from which it evidently endeavoured
to get free. Their progreffive motion was extremely flow, during which they vi-
brated to the right and left; and at each vibration they had a rolling unfleady mo-
tion in a vertical direction.
At the end of two or three hours, the feminal matter becoming ftill more fluid, a
greater number of thefe moving bodies appeared. They were then more free of
incumbrances; their tails were fhorter; their progreffive motion was more direCt,
and their horizontal motion greatly diminifhed. In five or fix hours, the feed had
acquired almoft all the fluidity it could acquire without being decompofed. Moll
of the fmall bodies were now difengaged from their threads : their figure was oval;
they moved forward with confiderable quicknefs. and, by their irregular motions
backward and forward, they had now more than ever the appearance of animals.
No. 5. U Thofe
74 A KEY TO PHYSIC
Thofe that had tails adhering to them, feemed to have lefs vivacity than the others:
and of thofe that had no tails, fome altered both their figure and their fize. In
twelve hours, the feed had depofited at the bottom of the vial a kind of afh-coloured
gelatinous fubftance, and the fluid at top was almoft as tranfparent as water. The
little bodies, being now entirely freed from their threads, moved with great agility*
and fome of them turned round their centres. They alfo often changed their
figures, from oval becoming round, and often breaking into fmaller ones. Their
''dlivity always increafed as their fize diminiflied. In twenty-four hours the feed
nad depofited a greater quantity of gelatinous matter, which, being with fome dif-
ficulty diluted in water, exhibited an appearance fomewhat refembling lace. In
the clear feed itfelf, only a few fmall bodies were now feen moving ; next day;
thefe were dill farther diminifhed ;
and after this nothing was to be feen but glo-
bules, without the lead appearance of motion. All the above-mentioned appear-
ances in the feed of man, are fhown in the Plate, at fig. 33, 34, 3o, 36, 37, and 38.
Fig. 39 and 40 reprefent an appearance of the globules in another experiment, in
which they arranged themfelves in troops, and paffed very quickly over the field
of the microfcope : in this experiment tey were found to proceed from a fmall
quantity of gelatinous mucilage, depofited by the feed.
An objedtion has, however, been made to the exidence of animalcules in the feed,
or in any other part of animal bodies, from the total exclufion of air, w hich is found
fo neceffary to the life of larger animals. Many inftances, however, have been ob-
ferved of large animals being found in fuch filiations as they could not poffibly have
enjoyed the lead; benefit from the air for a great number of years ; and in this date
have not only lived, but lived much longer than they would othenvife have done.
In Toulon harbour, and the road, are found folid hard dones* and perfectly en-
tire, containing, in different cells, fecluded from all communication with the air,
feveral living fhell-fifh, of an exquifite tafte, called duByli. To come at thefe
fifh, the dones are broken wdth mauls. Alfo, along the coad of Anconia, in the
Adriatic, are dones ufually weighing about fifty pounds, and fometimes even more;
the outfide rugged, and eafily broken, but the infide fo hard as to require a drong
arm and an iron maul to break them ;
within them, and in feparate niches, are
found fmall diell-fifh, quite alive, and very palatable, called folenes, or cappe lunghe.
Thefe fadts are atteded by Gaffendi, Blondel, Mayol, the learned bifhop of Sultu-
rara; and more particularly by Aldrovandus, a phyfician of Bologna. The two
latter fpeak of it as a common fadt which they themfelves faw.
In the volume for the year 1719, of the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences
at Paris, is the following palfage :
“ In the foot of an elm, of the bjgnefs of a pretty
corpulent
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 75
corpulent man, three or four feet above the root, and exactly in the centre, has
been found a live toad, middle-fized, but lean, and filling up the whole vacant
fpace : no fooner was apalfage opened by fplitting the wood, that it fcuttled away
very haftily : a more firm and found elm never grew ;
fo that the toad cannot be
fuppofed to have got into it. The egg or fpawn whence it was formed, muft, by
fome very fingular accident, have been lodged in the tree at its firft growth. There
the creature had lived without air, feeding on thefubftance of the tree, and grow-
ing only as the tree grew. This isattefted by Mr. Hubert, profeffor of philofophy
at Caen.”
The volume for the year 173 1 has a fimilar obfervation, exprelfed in thefe words
:
— “ In 1719, we gave an account of a fa6t, which, though improbable, was well at-
tefted ;
that a toad had been found living and grow’ing in the trunk of a middling
elm, without any way for the creature to come out or to have got in. M. Seigne, of
Nantes, lays before the academy a fa6t juft of the very fame nature, except that
inftead of an elm it was an oak, and larger than the elm, which ftill heightens the
wonder. He judges, by the time requifite for the growth of the oak, that the toad
muft have fubfifted in it, without air or any adventitious aliment, during eighty or
one hundred years. M. Seigne feems to have known nothing of the faft in 1719-”
With the two foregoing may be clafied a narrative of Ambrofe Pare, chief fur-
geon to Henry III. king of France, who, being a very fenfible writer, relates the
following fa6t, of which he was an eye-witnefs :
—“ Being (fays he) at my feat,
near the village of Meudon, and overlooking a quarry-man whom I had fet to
break fome very large and hard ftones ;
in the middle of one we found a huge
toad, full of life, and without any vifible aperture by which it could get there. I
began to wonder how it received birth, had grown and lived : but the labourer
told me, it was not the firft time he had met with a toad, and the like creatures,
within huge blocks of ftone, having no vifible opening or filfure.”
Obfervations of living toads, found in very hard and entire ftones, occur in fe-
veral authors, particularly Baptift Fulgofa, doge of Cenoa, the famous phyficians
Agricola and Horftius, and Lord Verulatn; others give very fpecious accounts of
fnakes, frogs, crabs, and lobfters,. being found alive, inclofed within blocks of mar-
ble, rocks, and large ftones.
An inftance fimilar to thefe, of the truth of which we have no reafon to doubt,
was obferved in this country in the year 1773, where a large toad was found in
the middle of a piece of coal, having not the leaft vifible crack or filfure.
Thus much as to the faculty of fome animals to live without air.
Upon the whole, though philofophers are not yet able to difcover how very mF
nute creatures are produced ;
yet, that there really are animals much fmaller than
what
76 A KEY TO PHYSIC
what we can difcern with our naked eye, feernsto be indifputable. And the fub-
je6t evidently requires the utmofl attention of philofophers, as well as further im-
provements in the conftruftion of mierofcopes, fully to invefligate and explain it.
—Moft naturalifls fuppofe another fpecies or order of invifible animalcules, iuch
as efcape the cognizance even of the befl mierofcopes, and give many probable
conjectures in relation to them. Reafon and analogy give fome fupport to the
exiftence of infinite imperceptible animalcules. The naked eye takes in from the
elephant to the mite ;
but there commences a new order, referved only for the
microfcope, which comprehends all thofe from the mite to thofe twenty-feven
millions of times fmaller; and this order cannot be yet faid to be exhaufted, if the
microfcope be not arrived at its lafl and highefl perfe&ion.
Animalcules are the caufe of various diforders. The itch, from feveral expe-
riments, is a diforder arifing from the irritations of a fpecies of infeCt found in
the puftules of that diforder, (the Acarus exulcerans;) whence the communication
of it by centaCl from one to another is eafily conceived; as alfo the reafon of the
cure being effe&ed by external applications. Many other cutaneous eruptions,
often fuppofed to originate in the blood, are nothing more than fettlements made
by colonies of thefe invifible beings. A fwarm of them light upon the fkin, and,
finding in its pores a comfortable habitation, foon produce a pun&ure, with fcabs
and irritation. But this is not the worft. Obfervation has long convinced me that
a variety of internal complaints in the flomach, pancreas, lungs, liver, and intef-
tines, are brought on by fwallowing myriads of thefe, and other imperceptible
living creatures, which inhabit raw vegetables and foul water; and, finding the
heat and food of the flomach congenial to their growth, they become a new fpe-
cies, of an alarming fize, and prey upon the vital parts, to the great detriment of
the patient’s health, and oftentimes at the expenfe of his life, before the malady
can be known, or even fufpe&ed.
A patient of mine, a young man near eighteen years of age, had been a confider-
able time in a confumptive habit, and difordered in the flomach ;
and notwithfland-
ing he had the advice of feveral eminent phyficians, and had taken a variety of
medicines, he never found the fmallefl alleviation of his pain. Upon enquiring
into the nature of his food for fome time before, he told me he came from a village
near Bridport, in Dorfetfhire, which abounds w ith water-creffes, and on thefe he had
fed almofl daily for fome months previous to his coming to London. I gave him
three emetics fucceffively, with a view to cleanfe the flomach from all flime, phlegm,
and undigefled food; and immediately after the lafl had operated, he took a flrong
dofe, undiluted, of my Solar TinCture. In lefs than ten minutes it brought up an
animal of the mofl hideous form, which at fir ft appeared incapable of motion, be-
ing
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 77
ing overcome by the ftrength of the medicine ;
but, on putting it into a bafon of
warm water, it quickly recovered, and fent forth a fet of tentacles or claws, which,
though greatly enlarged, and diverfely altered, foon convinced me it muft originally
have been a fhoot from the frefh-water polypus ;
that, on leaving the parent anitnal,
it had attached itfelf to a root or leaf of the vrater-creffes which this young man
unfortunately fwallowed. And it appeared further, that thefe tentacles or claws
had been fo ftrongly affixed to the bowels or coats of the ftomach, as to have defied
the poAver of all common remedies to remove them. The patient happily fdund
immediate relief, and is now healthy and robuft.
From feveral other patients, apparently in confumptions, or afflicted with naufea,
or uncommon fenfations in the ftomach and bowels, I have brought away living
animals that would terrify many people to look upon ;
and which muft have come
from the fpawn, or eggs, of minute animals, taken in with the food. For this rea-
fon I would admonifh all my readers to have the uttnoft care taken in the walking
and cleanfmg of fallads, water-creffes, and all raw vegetables ;
and particularly to
guard againft the long red worm which almoft continually lies concealed in the very
heart or centre of a head of celery. The fame caution is neceffary in eating all
kinds of fruit ;
fince nothing much more abounds with animalcules, and various
living creatures. Cold raw water, particularly when ftagnant, ought never to be
drunk. It is ever the fafeft way to boil your water, before it be ufed in the com-
pofition of any kind of beverage, or even to drink alone.
I might here adduce many other inftances of perfons having engendered living
creatures in their bowels, by fwallowing the eggs or fpawn of the parent animal.
A young man, fervant to Lord Stawell, at Holt-park near Farnham, Surry, had
eaten voracioufly of water-creffes. Some time afterwards he went into a decline,
and complained of a continual fenfation of pain at the pit of his ftomach, which no
medicine could remove. His lordfhip, having a value for the man, fent him to
town for the advice of the moft able phyficians ; but ftill to no purpofe. He was
in this ftate fent home to his friends, and given over as a loft and incurable
cafe. In this ftage fome ftrong emetics were given him by a country apothecary;
and he threw up, to the amazement of all the country round, an incredible
number of fmall tadpoles, which were evidently the produdtion of fpawn attached
to the water-creffes, eaten without care, and perhaps without wafiiing. The patient
recovered rapidly, and in lefs than a month was able to refume his former
avocation.
But a ftill more extraordinary cafe happened in the county of Hants, in the
year 1792, of a girl about fourteen years of age, who found a moft uncommon
fenfation in her ftomach and bowels, and could plainly feel and diftinguiih fome-

thing alive, and moving within her. The girl’s description was for fome time
treated as a chimera. At laft, however, lhe brought up a living toad 1 This un-
questionably mull have been taken into her Stomach in that ftate of the Spawn
which is juft emerging to tadpoles, and was attributed to her eating water-creSfes,
which had long been a common food with her. Nothing could have faved her from
poifon, but the creature having been bred and nourished up as it were in her own
body, and had affimilated fo much with the nature thereof as to have thus long
proved harmlefs. It is however certain, that, had it not been thus timely brought
away, She muft very foon have died.
Animalcules are the moll common caufes of foul and rotten teeth. They attack
the roots below the enamel, which they perforate, and in a Short time form cruSta-
tions or Scales round the teeth, as hard as Stones ; but which are nothing more than
a congeries or crullaceous Shell, which thefe little animals inhabit, and are probably
formed of the fine particles falling from the teeth during their perforations, ce-
mented together by a glutinous Slimy matter iffuing from their own bodies, which
are compofed of ringlets like a worm. Hence too we difcover the true caufe of
foetid or Slinking breath ;
for, when thefe little eels have made their way to the
marrow, or internal part, of the tooth, the whole crown foon becomes rotten, and
the marrow fends forth a putrid effluvia, fomewhat Similar, but much more offensive,
than the animalcules in Stinking cheefe. Thefe circumflances feem to be but
little known to the generality of dentifls and operators on the teeth ;
otherwife I
am perfuaded their mode of pradtice would be widely different. Inftead of apply-
ing powders and dentifrices calculated to defiroy thefe little worms, they prepare
fuch as multiply and nourifh them ;
of which any perfon may be convinced, who
will take the pains to make a few Simple experiments. Let the roots of the teeth
be Scraped, and the matter colledted from them put into a few drops of any denti-
frice or tooth-tindlure, particularly of the aromatic kind. If viewed with a mi-
crofcope, it will be Seen that the animalcules or eels found in this matter will move
about with great celerity, as if delighted with the liquor; and, in proportion as it
evaporates or dries away, the animals appear diSfatisfied and become very uneafy.
Happening to have a patient who had a very bad fet of teeth, he fuffered me to
make fome experiments upon them. I took off a few of the fcales, and emerged
them in a Small quantity of fpring water. It was quickly Silled with the little eels
or animalcules ; but imparted no ill fmell. I examined the fcales with the mi-
crofcope, and found them full of pores, out of which thefe invifible animals were
bluing. I then took out as much of the foul matter from the cavities of his hollow
teeth as I could conveniently get at ;
and, the moment I put it in the water, it be-
came foetid, and fent forth an offenfive fmell. Viewing it with the microfcope, the

animals appeared in the fame fhape as the former, but quite opaque, and the inteflinal
canal much fuller, and more diftended. I poured into the water a few drops of my
Solar Tindture, and in lefs than five minutes all motion ceafed, and they were
quite dead. This induced me to perfuade the man to wafh his teeth and gums well
with the Solar Tindture. He did fo ;
and I then took off more of the fcales, and
collected all the matter I could from the rotten teeth ;
but very few living animal-
cules could be found therein, and the foetid frnell was confiderably abated. He
continued to wafli his mouth with the Tindture every other day for a week, and
then ufed the following preparation : Chalk finely powdered, burnt hartfhorn le-
vigated, Florentine orris-root, and myrrh, of each tw’O drams ;
fpirit of fait, fix
drops ;
the whole mixed into a fine powder. With this he rubbed his teeth every
third day, with a foft brufh, and in lefs than three weeks his black fet of teeth be-
came beautifully white ;
his breath fweet ;
and his gums hard and firm ;
and he has
ever fince continued them fo by the fimple means above defcribed. I am no
dentift ;
what I have ftated was matter of mere accident : but I would caution all
my readers againft too free a ufe of thofe numerous powders and preparations con-
tinually recommended for the teeth. Inftead of preferving them, they have too
often the diredt contrary tendency, by deftroying the whole fet. The world how-
ever is fond of tooth-powders ;
and a moderate ufe of fome of them may be of fervice;
but the daily rubbing does more injury to the teeth than wholly neglecting them.
Fine levigated powders may be prudently ufed once in fix or feven days, to keep the
teeth white and fplendid. But the generality of powders prepared for this purpofe
are much too hard, and wear away the gums, as well as the enamel of the teeth.
Yet, notwithftanding the danger of thefe preparations, it is a very defirable thing to
be enabled to preferve the beauty and foundnefs of the teeth, from infancy to old
age. For this purpofe I would advife, that children fhould be accuftomed to wafh
their teeth every morning wdth common water, and a foft tooth-brufh; and after
meals to rince the mouth, and rub the teeth with their fingers, where a brufh can-
not conveniently be ufed. Thofe who conftantly purfue this method, may expect
to be free from rotten teeth, putrid flough, external difcolourations, flaccid gums,
and pain and loofenefs of the teeth, arifing from the animalcules which prey upon
them. When teeth have been negledted for a time, and fcales and cruftations are
affixed to them, thefe fhould be removed by inftruments, and the teeth and gums
well waflied with a powerful infinuating tindture, to kill the animalcules ;
then the
teeth fhould be rubbed with a fine teftaceous powder, in order to remove the difco-
louration. When the enamel is become perfedtly clean, white, and polilhed, even
this fine pow’der fhould be ufed very fparingly, and at diftant intervals. The colour
and
80 A KEY TO PHYSIC
and fweetnefs are only to be preferved by frequent brufliing and wafiling. The
common trick of dentifts is to give a vvafh that inftantly cleanfes and whitens the
teeth, the fudden effects of which are apt to furprife and pleafe people; but their
confequences are very pernicious. All the acid fpirits will do this ;
but they deftroy
the enamel, and rot the teeth. The fafeft liquid to take off black, green, and yellow,
difcolorations, is the following : Take plantane water, an ounce ;
honey of rofes,
two drams ;
fpirit of fait, ten drops : mix the whole together, and rub the teeth
well with a linen rag dipped in the mixture, every day till they are perfectly white.
If the roots of the teeth are very foul, inclined to grow' rotten, and furrounded
with fcales and cruftations, I fliould by all means recommend them to be well
waflied with the Solar Tindture, which will {top them from further decay, entirely
remove the fcurvy from the gums, and perfectly fw'eeten the breath.
The form, difpofition, and order, of the teeth, are admirable; and furnifh us with
a noble inftance of the wifdom and goodnefs of the Creator ;
the foremoft are weak,
and far from the centre, as being only preparers to the reft; the others, being to
grind and mafticate, are accordingly ftronger, and placed near the centre of motion.
Their peculiar hardnefs is very remarkable, confidering the tender fubftance they
are formed of. Again, their various forms, in various creatures, are no lefs con-
fiderable, being all curioufly adapted to the peculiar food and occafions of the
different fpecies of animals. Thus in the rapacious, they are fitted for the catching,
holding, and tearing, the prey ; in herbaceous, for the gathering and comminution
of vegetables ;
and in fuch as have no teeth, as birds, the bill fupplies the defedt.
Add to this, that the temporary defedt of them is no lefs obfervable in fome : that
children, for inftance, fliould have none while they are not able to ufe them, but
to hurt themfelves or the mother ; and that, at the very age when they can take in
the more fubftantial food, and live without the breaft, and begin to need teeth for
the help of fpeech, that then their teeth fliould begin to appear, and gradually
grow, as they more and more ftand in need of them ;
and that, when this firft crop
are w'orn out or decayed, they fliould be fucceeded by anevy fet, more firm and du-
rable than the former. Nature, indeed, fometimes deviates from the ordinary rule;
according to the conftrudtion of the elementary influx then operating, as is fliown at
large in my Illuftration of the Occult Sciences ;
whence we have inftances of per-
fons born with all their teeth, as Marcus Curius Dentatus and Cneius Papirius
Carbo : others have only had one continued tooth, reaching the whole length of the
jaw, as Pyrrhus king of Epirus, and Prufias fon of the king of Bithynia. A
German phyfician, named Mentrelius, allures us, that he faw an old man at Cleves,
in 1066,
aged a hundred and twenty years, who had a new fet of teeth only two
years

years before, which were cut with great pain' and he alfo faw an Englishman at
the Hague, who cut a new fet of teeth in his hundred and eighteenth year. To
the fame purpofe Dr. Slare mentions a relation, who had all his teeth at eighty
years of age, and afterwards died them, and had a new fet all round. See Phil,
Tranf. Abr. vol. v. p. 353.
Of INSTINCT.
INSTINCT is an occult power or difpodtion of the mind, by which animals are
unerringly direfted to do fpontaneoufly whatever is neceftary for the prefervation
of the individual, or the continuation of the fpecies. From this caufe, all the
adtions of brutes, or inferior animals, are faid to be diredted by injiintt
;
but thofe
of man by reafon. Philofophers, however, have greatly differed in their opinions
concerning this fubjedt ;
and modern authors are extremely at a lofs where to draw
the line. Some maintain that man is endowed with a greater number of inftindts
than any fpecies of brutes whatever. Others infift, that in human nature there
is not any power or propenfity at all, which can properly be called inftin<5tive.
Some contend that brutes are guided wholly by an invariable inftindt, without the
fmalleft power of memory, or of any intelledtual faculty ;
whilfl others infift, that
they poffefs a vegetative foul, dire<5ted by a certain inftindt, capable of reafon/ of
memory, and of experience.
With refpedt to man, nothing can be more apparent, than that, as being the
microcofm, or epitome of all created nature, he muft of neceffity partake of all
its effential properties ;
of which reafon and inftintt rank amongft the foremoft.
Upon the flighteft refle6tion, it will be obvious to every reader, that reafon can
never be exercifed but from experience ;
confequently, until man is arrived to a
certain degree of maturity, he muft be diredted, in moft of the propenfities of na-
ture, by mere inftin6t. Thus an infant, a few moments after its birth, is diredted
by an inftin&ive impulfe for its prefervation, to feek the breaft, and to fuck it
;
and to the fame caufe, in the earlier ftages of life, and in all favage uneducated
countries, are to be attributed the firft fenfations or defires of copulation, not
from the pleafures of enjoyment, for they are then unknown; but from an impul-
five inftindt, for the propagation of the fpecies. It has been infifted, that the
firft commerce of the fexes amongft human beings is dire&ed by reafon ; and the
arguments affigned for it are thefe ;
that, as foon as the organs of generation in
either fex become fufficiently ripe for the purpofe intended by nature, they fym-
pathife with the fenfes, and are affedted with vibrations in the nerves, which rife
into pleafure above the power of controul, and are heightened by youth, health,
No. 6. Y grateful
82 A KEY TO PHYSIC
grateful aliment, imagination, ambition, fympathy, and various other involuntary
fenfations, which, under fuch circumftances, pervade the whole fyftem. And as
thefe organs are endued with a greater degree of fenfibility than the other parts,
both from their make, and the peculiar ftruCture and difpofition of their nerves;
from the great diftention of the mufcular fyftem and feed-velfels in males; as well
as from the extenfion of the clitoris and finufes of the uterus in females, which never
fail to take place about the time of puberty, the genital organs in both fexes be-
come fo extremely irritable, that reafon, being thereby awakened, directs and impels
to that aCt, by which alone the human fpecies can poffibly be continued, and the
works of an Omnipotent Creator carried on and conduced to the ends intended.
In the above ftatement, I am perfuaded every rational mind will agree, that the
word ivjiinti ought to have been fubflituted where that of reafon is ufed ; becaufe i«
civilized focietieswe are taught by reafon to overcome thofe inftinCtive paffions, in-
ftead of having our reafon awakened by them ;
but we too often find that thefe in-
ftinClive paffions are proof againft both reafon and refolution, even in the moft
virtuous families, in all countries, and in the beft-regulated focieties. What fhall
we fay then of that part of the human race which yet remains in a ftate of nature,
uncultivated, and unenlightened by any precepts of morality orfcience? They
are fubjeCt to the primary command, “ Increafe and multiply and they obey it.
A couple of young favages go together for the firjl time, without any view to
offspring, without any knowledge of the pleafure to be derived from it, and with-
out any determinate idea at all ;
and, as we fee thefe means invariably purfued by
all animals, as well rational as irrational, w ithout experience, and without inftruc-
tion, wr
e mull refer the mutual defire of the fexes to a much higher principle than
can poffibly arife from human motives ;
and that principle can be nothing but in-
ftinCt. But as I fhall have occafion to fpeak more at large on this fubjeCt under
the article Love, when I come to treat of the affections and paffions of the mind,
and of the nature and perfections of Man, I fhall in the interim proceed to fliow,
that the inferior animals are directed by inftinCt to performances of the moft fur-
prifing kind ; and are, within certain limits, endued with memory, and a reafoning
intellect.
The moft remarkable inftance of the power of inftinCt is obferved in the con-
ftruCtion of a honey-comb. Bees, it is well known, conftruCt their combs with
fmall cells on both fides, fit both for holding their ftore of honey, and for rearing
their young. There are only three poffible figures of the cells, which can make
them all equal and fimilar, without any ufelefs interftices. Thefe are the equila-
teral triangle, the fquare, and the regular hexagon. Of the three, the hexagon is the

moft proper, both for convenience and ftrength. Bees, as if they knew this,
make their cells regular hexagons. As the combs have cells on both fides, the
cells may either be exadtly oppofite, having partition againft partition, or the
bottom of a cell may reft upon the partitions between the cells on the other fide,
which will ferve as a buttrefs to ftrengthen it. The laft way is the beft for ftrength
;
accordingly the bottom of each cell refts againft the point where three partitions
meet on the other fide, which gives it all the ftrength poflible. The bottom of a
cell may either be one plane, perpendicular to the fide-partitions ;
or it may be
compofed of feveral planes, meeting in a folid angle in the middle point. It is
only in one of thefe two ways that all the cells can be fimilar without lofing room.
And for the fame intention, the planes, of which the bottom is compofed, if there
be more than one, muft be three in number, and neither more nor fewer. It has
been demonftrated, that, by making the bottoms of the cells to confift of three
planes meeting in a point, there is a faving of material and labour no-way inconfi-
derable. The bees, as if acquainted with thefe principles of folid geometry, fol-
low them moft accurately ;
the bottom of each cell being compofed of three planes,
which make obtufe angles with the fide partitions and with one another, and meet
in a point in the middle of the bottom ;
the three angles of this bottom being fup-
ported by three partitions on the other fide of the comb, and the point of it by the
common interfedtion of thefe three partitions. Oneinftance more of the mathe-
matical fkill dilplayed in the ftrudture of a honey-comb deferves to be mentioned.
It is a curious mathematical problem, at w'hat precife angle the three planes which
compofe the bottom of a cell ought to meet, in order to make the greateft poflible
faving of material and labour. This is one of thofe problems belonging to the
higher parts of the mathematics, which are called problems of maxima and minima.
The celebrated Maclaurin refolved it by a fluxionary calculation, which is to be
found in the Tranfadtions of the Royal Society of London, and determined pre-
cifely the angle required. Upon the moft exadt menfuration which the fubjedt
could admit, he afterwards found, that it is the very angle in which the three
planes in the bottom of the cell of a honey-comb do actually meet. If a honey-
comb were a w?
ork of human art, every man of common fenfe would conclude,
without hefnation, that he who invented the conftrudtion muft have utiderftood
the principles on which it was conftrudted. We need not fay that bees know none
of thefe things. They work moft geometrically without any knowledge of geome-
try; fomewhat like a child, who by turning the handle ©f an organ makes good
mufic without ^any knowledge of mufic. The art is not in the child, but in him
who made the organ. In like manner, when a bee makes its comb fo geometri-
cally.
8'4 A KEY TO PHYSIC
cally, the geometry is not in the bee, but in that great Geometrician who made
the bee, and made all things in number, weight, and meafure. This places in a
moft ftriking point of view the difference betwixt inftindt and reafon. There are
no improvements made by man, but what we fee carried ftill further by fucceeding
generations ;
but in bees, and in all inferior animals, we fee precifely the fame
economy and contrivance now, in conftrudting their cells, building their nefts, lay-
ing up provifions, &c. as at the beginning ;
and that in all ages, and in all gene-
rations, they have neither improved, nor departed from, that fixed fyftem alfigned
to them by nature, for their prefervation and guidance ;
whereas men, adting by
reafon and fcience, improve from the labours and inventions of each other. Were
we to attribute reafon inftead of inftindt to bees, in the conftru&ion of their combs,
we fhould at the fame time admit them to be rational creatures, endued with think-
ing and reafoning faculties far fuperior to men ;
for the principle upon which the
honey-comb is conftru6ted, is founded oh thofe high departments of the mathema-
tics, w'hich were altogether unknown to the human race till the beginning of the
prefent century, and which at this moment are beyond the comprehenfion of nine-
tenths of mankind in the moft enlightened nations on earth. Hence it is plain that
the contrivance is not in the bees, but in the Creator of the bees, who direfts them,
and all brute creatures, to a6t by an inftindl for their own immediate benefit, with-
out knowing the principles upon which they a6t. And this is by no means contrary
to reafon ;
for we daily fee men, working under the diredtion of others of fuperior
underftanding, to effect purpofes, and accomplifh ends, without having them felves
any idea of either; and, if we look through the endlefs variety of human avoca-
tions, we fhall find that the greater part of mankind feem deftined by God and
nature to be governed in this way. But to proceed
—
Caterpillars, when ihaken off a tree in every dire&ion, inftantly turn round
towards the trunk, and climb up, though they had never formerly been on the fur-
face of the ground. This is a ftriking inftance of inftiruft. On the tree, and not
upon the ground, the caterpillar finds its food. If therefore it did not turn and
climb up the trunk, it would inevitably perifh. The folitary wafp digs holes in
the fand, in each of which fhe depofits an egg : lhte colledts a few fmall green
worms, which fhe rolls up in a circular form, and fixes in the hole in fuch a man-
ner that they cannot move. When the wafp-worm is hatched, it is amply ftored
with the food which nature has deftined for its fupport. The green worms are de-
voured in fucceffion; and the number depofited is exa&ly proportioned to the time
neceffary for the growth and transformation of the wafp-worm into a fly ; then it
iffues from the hole, and is capable of procuring its own nourifliment. This in-

ftindt of the parent-wafp is the more remarkable, that the feeds not upon fleth her-
felf. Birds of the fame fpecies, unlefs when retrained by peculiar circumftances,
uniformly build their nefts of the fame materials, and in the fame form and fituation,
though they inhabit very different climates ;
and the form and fituation are always
exadtly fuited to their nature, and calculated to afford them fhelter and protection.
When danger, or any other circumftance peculiar to certain countries, renders a
deviation from the common form or fituation of nefts neceffary, that deviation is
made in an equal degree, and in the very fame manner, by all the birds of one fpe-
cies; and it is never found to extend beyond the limits of the country where alone it
can ferve any good purpofe. When removed by neceffity from their eggs, birds
return to them with hafte and anxiety, and fliift them fo as to heat them equally;
and it is worthy of obfervation, that their hafte to return is always in proportion to
the coldnefs of the climate. Thus the oftrich in Senegal, where the heat is exceffive,
negledts her eggs during the day, but fits upon them in the night. At the Cape
of Good Hope, however, where the degree of heat is lefs, the oftrich, like other
birds, fits upon her eggs both day and night. In countries infefted with monkeys,
many birds, which in other climates build in bullies and clefts of trees, fufpend their
nefts upon {lender twigs, and thus elude the rapacity of their enemies.
The following is remarkable.—A cat frequented a clofet, the door of which was
fattened by an iron latch. A window was fituated near the door. When the door
was fhut, the cat gave herfelf no uneafinefs. As foon as file was tired of her con-
finement, fhe mounted on the fill of the window, and with her paw dexteroufly
lifted the latch, and came out. This pradtice, which we are told continued for
years, muft have been the confequence of reafoning in particular ideas. It could
not be the effedt of inftindt; for inftindt is adapted only to a ftate of nature, in
which cats have neither latches to lift nor doors to open ;
and as it is not faid that
the animal attempted to lift the latches of other doors, we are not authorifed to
infer that this particular adtion was the confequence of reafoning in ideas enlarged
by abftradtion : the cat had repeatedly feen one door opened by an exertion which
die was capable of imitating. It is well known that crows feed upon feveral kinds
of fhell-fifh when within their reach; and that they contrive to break the fhell by
raifing the fifh to a great height, and letting it drop upon a ftone or a rock. This may
perhaps be confidered as pure inftindt, directing the animal to the proper means of
acquiring its food. But what is to be thought of the following fadt, communi-
cated by a gentleman whofe veracity is unqueftioned, and who, being totally un-
acquainted with the theories of philolophers, has of courfe no favourite hypothecs
to fupport 7 In the fpring of the year 1791, a pair of crows made their neft in a

he had often been amufed by witnefling furious combats between them and a cat.
One morning the battle raged more fiercely than ufual, till at laft the cat gave wav
and took fhelter under a hedge, as if to wait a more favourable opportunity of re-
treating to the houfe. The crows continued for a fliort time to make a threatening
noife : but, perceiving that on the ground they could do nothing more than threaten,
one of them lifted a ftone from the middle of the garden, and perched with it on a
tree planted in the hedge, where fhe fat watching the motions of the enemy of her
young. As the cat crept along under the hedge, the crow accompanied her by
flying from branch to branch, and from tree to tree; and, when at laft pufs ven-
tured to quit her hiding-place, the crow, leaving the trees and hovering over her
in * the air, let the ftone drop from on high on her back. That the crow on this
occafion reafoned, is felf-evident, and it feems to be little lefs evident, that the
ideas employed in her reafoning were enlarged beyond thofe which fhe had received
from her fenfes. By her fenfes flie may have perceived, that the fhell of a fifli is
broken by a fall; but could her fenfes inform her, that a cat w'ould be wounded or
driven off the field by the fall of a ftone? No ;
from the effedlof the one fall pre-
ferved in her memory, fhe muft have inferred the other by her power of reafoning.
As to the natural affe6tion of brutes, fays an ingenious writer, “ the more I re-
fled! on it, the more I am aftonifhed at its effedts.” It feems to awaken the paffions,
quicken the invention, and fliarpen the fagacity, of the brute creation. Thus a
hen, juft become a mother, is no longer that placid bird fhe ufed to be, but with
feathers ftanding on end, wings hovering, and clocking note, fhe flies at every
thing which feems to threaten her brood. Dams will throw themfelves in the way
of the greateft danger, in order to avert it from their progeny. Thus a partridge
will tumble along before a fportfman, in order to draw away the dogs from her
helplefs covey. In the time of nidification the moft feeble birds will affault the
moft rapacious. All the hirundines of a village are up in arms at the fight of a
hawk, whom they will perfecute till he leaves that diftiicl. A very exadt obferver
has often remarked, that a pair of ravens neftling in the rock of Gibraltar, would
fuffer no vulture or eagle to reft near their ftation, but would drive them from the
hill with an amazing fury: even the blue thrufh at the feafon of breeding would
dart out from the clefts of the rocks to chafe away the keftril or the fparrow-hawk.
If you ftand near the neft of a bird that has young, fhe will not be induced to betray
them by an inadvertent fondnefs, but will wait about at a diftance, wdth meat in
her mouth, for an hour together.
A moft Angular effedt of inftindt may be obferved in the means by which cuc-
kows are propagated. Unlike the generality of birds, they do not pair. When
a female appears on the wing, fhe is often attended by two or three males, who

feem to be earneftly contending for her favours. From the time of her appearance
till after the middle of fummer, the nefts of the birds feledted to receive her egg are
to be found in great abundance; but, like the other migrating birds, the does not
begin to lay till fome weeks after her arrival. It is on all hands allowed, that the
cuckow does not hatch its own eggs. The hedge-fparrow, the water-wagtail, the
titlark, the red-breaft, the yellow-hammer, the green-linnet, or the winchat, is
generally the nurfe of the young cuckow. It may be fuppofed, that the female
cuckow lays her egg in the abfence of the bird in whofe neft the intends to depofit;
as it has been known, that, on fight of one of thcfe, a red-breaft and its mate jointly
attacked her on approaching the neft, putting her to flight ;
and fo effedtually drove
her away, that the did not dare to return. Among the birds above mentioned, it
generally feledts the three firft, but fliows a much greater partiality to the hedge-
fparrow. This laft commonly takes up four or five days in laying her eggs. Dur-
ing this time (generally after the has laid one or two), the cuckow contrives to de~
pofit her egg among the reft, leaving the future care of it entirely to the hedge-
fparrow. When the hedge-fparrow has fat her ufual time, and difengaged the
young cuckow and fome of her own offspring from the fliell, her own young ones,
and any of her eggs that remain unhatched, are foon turned out, the young cuckow
remaining poffeffor of the neft, and foie objedt of her future care. The young birds
are not previoufly killed, nor are the eggs demolished ;
but all are left to perilh to-
gether, either entangled about the bufh which contains the neft, or lying on the
ground under it. The early fate of the young hedge-fparrow (fays Mr. Jenner, who
made thefe experiments) is a circumftance that has been noticed by others, but at-
tributed to wrong caufes ;
but the true caufe we Shall prefently explain. A
variety of conjedtures have been formed upon it. A cuckow laid her egg in a
water-wagtail’s neft in the thatch of an old cottage. The wagtail fat her ufual time,
and then hatched all the eggs but one ;
which, with all the young ones except the
cuckow, was turned out of the neft. The young birds, confifting of five, were found
upon the rafter that projedted from under the thatch, and with them was an egg not
in the leaft injured. The cuckow was reared by the wagtails till it tvas nearly ca-
pable of flying, when it was killed by an accident.
A hedge-fparrow built her neft in a hawthorn-buSh in a timber-yard. After She
had laid two eggs, a cuckow dropped in a third. The fparrow continued laying
as if nothing had happened, till She had laid five, her ufual number, and then fat.
On infpedting the neft, June 20, 1786, (fays Mr. Jenner,) I found that the bird
had hatched this morning, and that every thing but the young cuckow was thrown
out. Under the neft I found one of the young hedge-fparrows dead, and one egg
by the fide of the neft entangled with the coarfe woody materials that formed its out-
fide
88 A KEY TO PHYSIC
fide covering. On examining the egg, I found one end of the fhell a little crack-
ed, and could fee that the fparrow it yet contained was alive. It was then reftored
to the neft, but in a few minutes was thrown out. The egg, being again fufpended
by the outfide of the neft, was faved a fecond time from breaking. To fee what
would happen if the cuckow was removed, I took out the cuckow, and placed the
egg containing the hedge-fparrow in the nefl in its ftead. The old birds, during
this time, flew about the fpot, fhowing figns of great anxiety ;
but, when I with-
drew, they quickly came to the neft again. On looking into it in a quarter of an
hour afterwards, I found the young one completely hatched, warm, and lively.
The hedge-fparrows were fuffered to remain undifturbed with their new charge for
three hours (during which time they paid every attention to it), when the cuckow
was again put into the neft ;
and, on examining it again in a few minutes, I found
the young fparrow was tumbled out. It was a fecond time reftored, but again ex-
perienced the fame fate. From thefe experiments, and fuppofing, from the feeble
appearance of the young cuckow juft difengaged from the fhell, that it was utterly
incapable of difplacing either the egg or the young fparrows, I was induced to be-
lieve that the old fparrows were the only agents in'this feemingly-unnatural bufinefs*
But I afterwards clearly perceived the caufe of this ftrange phenomenon, by difco-
vering the young cuckow in theadl of difplacing its fellow-neftlings, as the follow-
ing relation will fully evince. June 18, 1787, I examined the neft of a hedge-fpar-
row-, which then contained a cuckow’s and three hedge-fparrow’s eggs. On in-
fpe&ing it the day following, I found the bird had hatched, but that the neft now
contained only a young cuckow and one young hedge-fparrow. The neft was
placed fo near the extremity of a hedge, that I could diftindlly fee what was going
forward in it ;
and, to my aftonifhment, faw the young cuckow, though fo newly
hatched, in the a6t of turning out the young hedge-fparrow. The mode of accom-
plilhing this was very curious. The little animal, with the alfiftance of its rump
and w ings, contrived to get the bird upon its back; and making a lodgement for
the burden by elevating its elbow's, clambered backward with it up the fide of the
neft, till it reached the top ;
where refting for a moment, it threw off its load with
a jerk, and quite difengaged it from the neft. It remained in this fituation a fhort
time, feeling about with the extremities of its wings, as if to be convinced whe-
ther the buftnefs was properly executed, and then dropped into the neft again.
With thefe (the extremities of its wings) I have often feen it examine, as it were,
an egg and nettling before it began its operations ; and the nice fenfibility which
thefe parts appeared to poffefs, feemed fufficiently to compenfate the want of fight,
which as yet it was deftitute of. I afterwards put in an egg ;
and this, by a fimi-
lar procefs, was conveyed to the edge of the neft and thrown out. Thefe experi-
ments
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 89
ment I have fince repeated feveral times in different nefts, and have always found
the young cuckow difpofed to a6t in the fame manner. In climbing up the neft,
it fometimes drops its burden, and thus is foiled in its endeavours; but, after a lit-
tle refpite, the work is refumed, and goes on almoft incelfantly till it is effedted.
It is wonderful to fee the extraordinary exertions of the young cuckow, when it is
two or three days old, if a bird be put into the neft with it that is too weighty for
it to lift out. In this ftate it feems ever reftlefs and uneafy. The Angularity of
its fhape is well adapted to thefe purpofes; for, different from other newly-hatched
birds, its back, from the fcapulte downward, is very broad, with a confiderable
depreflion in the middle. This depreflion feems formed by nature for the defign
of giving a more fecure lodgement to the egg of the hedge-fparrow, or its young
one, when the young cuckow is employed in removing either of them from the neft.
When it is about twelve days old, this cavity is quite filled up, and then the back
affumes the fhape of neftling birds in general.,
It appears a little extraordinary that two cuckows eggs fhould ever be depofited
in the fame neft, as the young one produced from one of them tnuft inevitably perifli;
yet two inftances of this kind fell under our author’s obfervation, one of which he
thus relates: Two cuckows and a hedge-fparrow were hatched in the fame neft this
morning, (June 27, 1787;) one hedge-fparrow’s egg remained unhatched. In a
few hours after, a conteft began between the cuckows for the poffeflion of the
neft, which continued undetermined till the next afternoon, when one of them,
which was fomewhat fuperior in fize, turned out the other, togetherwith the young
hedge-fparrow and the unhatched egg. This conteft w as very remarkable. The
combatants alternately appeared to have the advantage, as each carried the other
feveral times nearly to the top of the neft, and then funk down again, oppreffed
by the weight of its burden; till at length, after various efforts, the ftrongeft pre-
vailed, and was afterwards brought up by the hedge-fparrows.
But the principal circumftance that has agitated the mind of naturalifts refpedting
the cuckow is, why, like other birds, it fhould not build a neft, incubate its eggs,
and rear its own young? The moft probable fuggeftion is, the fhort refidence this
bird is allowed to make in the country where it is deftined to propagate its fpe-
cies ;
and the sail that nature has upon it, during that refidence, to produce a nu-
merous progeny. The cuckow’s firft appearance here is about the middle of
April, commonly on the 17th. Its egg is ndt ready for incubation till fome weeks
after its arrival, feldom before the middle of May. A fortnight is taken up by
the fitting bird in hatching the egg. The young bird generally continues three
weeks in the neft before it flies, and the fofter-parents feed it more than five weeks
after this period ;
fo that, if a cuckow fhould be ready with an egg much fooner
No. 6. A a than
90 A KEY TO PHYSIC
than the time pointed out, not a Angle neftling, even one of the earlieft, would
be fit to provide for itfelf before its parent would be inftin&ively direded to feek
a new refidence, and be thus compelled to abandon its young one; for old cuc_
kows take their final leave of this country the firft week in July. Among the
many peculiarities of the young cuckow, there is one that fiiows itfelf very early.
Long before it leaves the neft, it frequently, when irritated, afiumes the manner
of a bird of prey, looks ferocious, throws itfelf back, and pecks at any thing pre-
fented to it, with great vehemence, often at the fame time making a chuckling noife
like a young hawk. Hence probably the vulgar opinion, that this bird changes
into a hawk, and devours its nurfe on quitting its neft; whence the French pro-
verb, Ingrat comme un coucou, “ As ungrateful as a cuckow.” Sometimes, when
difturbed in a fmaller degree, it makes a kind of hi fling noife, accompanied w ith a
heaving motion of the whole body. From w'hat has been faid, it becomes evident,
that the fame inftin&ive impulfe which dire&s the cuckow to depofit her eggs in
the nefts of other birds, dire&s her young one to throw' out the eggs and young of
the owner of the neft. The fcheme of nature would be incomplete without it; for
it would be extremely difficult, if not impoflible, for the little birds deftined to find
fuccour for the cuckow, to find it alfo for their owm young ones after a certain pe-
riod ; nor would there be room for them to inhabit the neft. Cuckows may be, and
often are, brought up tame, fo as to become familiar. They will eat in this ftate
bread and milk, fruits, infe&s, eggs, and flefh, either cooked or raw; but in a ftate
of nature, they chiefly live on caterpillars. When fat, they are faid to be as good
eating as a land-rail: tire French and Italians eat them to this day. The ancient
Romans admired them greatly as food : Pliny fays that there is no bird which can
be compared to them for delicacy. In migrating, the major part of thefe birds are
fuppofed to go into Africa; fince they are obferved to vifit the ifland of Malta
twice in a year, in their pafiage backwards and forwards, as is fuppofed, to that
part of the world.
The inftin6t which has been difcovered in ants, beavers, &c. is too well known
and admired, to need any mention in this place : and we fee in a grea t variety of
birds, infe&s, and quadrupeds, a fimilar economy in laying up ftores of provifion in
time of plenty, that they might have accefs to it in time of need. The common daw
has a peculiar knack of this fort ;
and, in houfes where they have been brought up
tame, have frequently been known to hide, with their meat, money, rings, feaLs,
lockets, and other fmall trinkets, thereby occafioning injurious fufpicions of theft
in fervants or others, w’ho are perfectly innocent.
We have a remarkable anecdote given by the Rev. Mr. Robinfon of Oufiby in
Weftmoreland, relative to an inftinft in crows, by which they are made the na-
tural
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 91
fural planters of all forts of wood and trees. They difleminate the kernels upon
the earth, which like nurferies bring them forth till they grow up to their natural
ftrength and perfe6tion. He fays, “ About twenty-five years ago, coming from
Rofecaftle early in the morning, I obferved a great number of crows very bufy at
their work upon a declining ground of a moffy furface ;
I went out of my way on
purpofe to view their labour, and I found they were planting a grove of oaks.
The manner of their planting was thus : they firft made little holes in the earth
with their bills, going about and about till the hole was deep enough ; and then
they dropped in the acorn, and covered it with earth and mofs. The feafon was
at the latter end of autumn, when all feeds are full ripe.” Mr. Robinfon feems to
think that Providence had given the crows this inftin6fc folely for the propagation
of trees ; but I imagine it was given them principally for their own prefervation,
by hiding provifion in time of plenty, in order to fupply them in a time of fcarcity f
fo that fuch an inftinft in thefe birds may anfwer a double purpofe ; both then-
own fupport in times of need, and the propagation of the trees they plant : for,
wherever they hide a great number of nuts or grains in the earth, we cannot fup-
pofe they find them all again ;
but that as many will remain in the plot of ground
they make ufe of, as can well grow by one another.
A wonderful fpirit of fociality in the brute creation, independent of fexual at-
tachment, has been frequently remarked. Many horfes, though quiet with com-
pany, will not flay one minute in a field by themfelves : the ftrongeft fences cannot
reftrain them. A horfe has been known to leap out at a ftable-window through
which dung was thrown, after company ; and yet in other refpe&s to be remarka-
bly quiet. Oxen and cows will not fatten by themfelves; but will neglect the fined
pafture that is not recommended by fociety. It would be needlefs to inftance in
fheep, which conftantly flock together. But this propenfity feems not to be con-
fined to animals of the fame clafs or fpecies. Even great difparity of kind and
fize does not always prevent fociai advances and mutual fellowfhip. Of this the
following remarkable inftance is given : A gentleman who kept but one horfe, hap-
pened alfo on a time to have but one folitary hen: thefe two incongruous animals
fpent much of their time together in a lonely orchard, where they faw no creature
but each other: by degrees an apparent regard began to take place between thefe
two fequeftered individuals : the fowl would approach the quadruped with notes
of complacency, rubbing herfelf gently againft his legs; while the horfe would
look down with fatisfa6tion, and move with the greateft caution and circumfpec-
tion, left he fhould trample on his diminutive companion ;
and thus by mutual
good offices each feemed to confole the vacant hours of the other.
In
92 A KEY TO PHYSIC
In the Gentleman’s Magazine for March 1788, we have the following anecdotes
of a raven. The raven alluded to “ lives, or did live three years fince, at the Red
Lion at Hungerford; his name, I think, is Rafe. You muft know then, that,
coming into that inn, my chaife ran over and bruifed the leg of my Newfound-
land dog; and, while we were examining the injury done to the dog’s foot, Rafe
was evidently a concerned fpedtator; for, the minute the dog was tied up under
the manger with my horfe, Rafe not only vifited, but fetched him bones, and
attended upon him with particular and repeated marks of kindnefs. The bird’s
notice of the dog was fo marked, that I obferved it to the hoftler ;
for I had not
heard a word before of the hiftory of this benevolent creature. John then told me,
that he had been bred from his pin-feather in intimacy with a dog ;
that the affec-
tion between them was mutual ; and that all the neighbourhood had often been
witneffes of the innumerable a6ts of kindnefs they had conferred upon each other.
Rafe’s poor dog, after a while, unfortunately broke his leg; and during the long
time he was confined, Rafe waited upon him conftantly, carried him his pro-
vifions daily, and never fcarcely left him alone ! One night by accident the
hoftler had fhut the ftable door, and Rafe was deprived of the company of his
friend the whole night; but the hoftler found in the morning the bottom of the
door fo pecked away, that, had it not been opened, Rafe would in, another hour
have made his own entrance-port. I then enquired of my landlady, and heard
what I have related confirmed by her, with feveral other fingular traits of the
kindnelfes this bird {hows to all dogs in general, but particularly to maimed or
wounded ones. I hope and believe, however, the bird is Hill living; and the
traveller will find I have not over-rated his merit.”
To thefe inftances of attachment between incongruous animals from a fpirit of
fociality or the feelings of fympathy, may be added the following inftance of fond-
nefs from a different motive, recounted by Mr. White, in his Hiflory of Selborne :
“ My friend had a little helplefs leveret brought to him, which the lervants fed
with milk in a fpoon ;
and about the fame time his cat kittened, and the young
were difpatched and buried. The hare was foon loft, and fuppofed to be gone
the way of moft foundlings, or killed by fome dog or cat. However, in a fortnight
after, as the mafter was fitting in his garden in the dulk of the evening, he ob-
ferved his cat, with tail ere6t, trotting towards him, and calling with little ffiort
inward notes of complacency, fuch as they ufe towards their kittens, and fome-
thing gamboling after, which proved to be the leveret, which the cat had fup-
ported with her milk, and continued to fupport with great affebtion. Thus was a
graminivorous animal nurtured by a carnivorous and predacious one! Why fo cruel
and fanguinary a beaft as a cat, of the ferocious genus of felis, the murium leo,
as
AND OCCULT SCIENCE. 93
as Linnaeus calls it, fhould be affe&ed with any tendernefs towards an animal
which is its natural prey, is not fo eafy to determine. This ftrange affe£lion
probably was occafioned by that defiderium, thofe tender maternal feelings,
which the lofs of her kittens had awakened in her bread j and by the compla-
cency and eafe (he derived to herfelf from the' procuring her |teats to be drawn,
which were too much diftended with milk, till from habit (he became as much
delighted with this foundling as if it had been her real offspring. This incident
is no bad folution of that ftrange circumftance which grave biftorians as well as
poets affert, of expofed children being fometimes nurtured by female wild
beafts that had probably loft their young. For it is not one whit more marvellous
that Romulus and Remus, in their infant ftate, ftiould be nurfed by a fhe-wolf,
than that a poor little fucking leveret ftiould be foftered and cherifhed by a bloody
grimalkin.
That brute animals poffefs refle&ion and fentiment, and are fufceptible of the
kindly as well as the irrafcible paflions, independently of fexual attachment and na-
tural affe&ion ;
and that they have a great ftiare of fidelity, of pride, and even a
fenfe of glory ; may be demonftrated from the elephant, the horfe, and the dog.
Elephants, even in a favage ftate, are peaceable and gentle creatures. They never
ufe their weapons but in defence of themfelves or companions. Their facial dif-
pofitions are fo ftrong, that they are feldom found alone, but march always in large
troops : the oldeft and mod experienced lead the van ; the younger or lame ones
keep in the middle; and thofe of a fecond rate, as to age, walk in the rear. The
females carry their young on their tufks, embracing them at the fame time with their
trunk. They feldom march in this regular order but when they reckon the jour-
ney dangerous, fuch as an expedition to cultivated lands, where they expe£t to
meet with refiftance. On other occafions they are lefs cautious; fome of them fall-
ing behind or feparating from the reft, but feldom fo far as to be without the
reach of affifiance by alarming and affembling their companions. It is dangerous
to offer them the leaft injury ; for they run ftraight upon the offender ; and, although
the weight of their body be great, their fteps are fo large, that they eafily
outrun the fwifteft man, whom they either pierce with their tufks, or feize with
their trunk, dart him in the air like a ftond, and then trample him under their feet.
But they never attack any perfon Unlefs when provoked. However, as they are
extremely fenfible and delicate With regard to injuries, it is always prudent to keep
out of their way. Travellers who frequent thdfe countries kindle large fires, and
beat drums, during the night, in order to prevent their approach. After being
once attacked by men, or falling into any ambufh, they are faid never to forget

the injury, but fearch for every opportunity of getting revenge. As they are en-
dowed perhaps with a more exquifite fenfation of fmell than any other animal, owing
to the great extent of their nofe, they can fcent a man at a very great dillance, and
trace him by his footdeps.
I he elephant, when tamed, is the mod friendly and obedient of all animals;
he is entirely attached to the perfon who feeds and takes care of him. In a fhort
time he underdands figns, and the found of his mader’s voice. He didinguifhes
the language of paffion, of command, of fatisfa&ion ; and a£ts accordingly.
He receives his orders with attention, and executes them with prudence and ala.
crity, but without precipitation. He eafily learns to bow his knees and lower his
body, for the convenience of thofe who mount him. He careffes his friends with
his trunk. He lifts burdens with his trunk, and affifts thofe who are loading him in
laying them on his back. He delights in fhining harnefs and trappings. When
yoked in a cart or waggon, he pulls equally and cheerfully, unlefs he be abufed
by injudicious chadifement. His guide is generally mounted on his neck, with
a fmall rod of iron, lharp at the point, in his hand ; he direfts his motion by pricking
him on the ears and head; but, for the mod part, a word is fufficient. A
tame elephant will do more labour than fix horfes; but then he requires a propor-
tional quantity of food. They are the principal beads of burden in many parts of
Africa and the Eafl Indies. They carry facks and bundles of all kinds on their
neck, back, and tufks. They never lof« or damage any thing committed to their
care : they will Hand on the edge of a river, take bundles off their necks and tufks,
lay them carefully in a boat, whenever they are defired, and try with their trunk
whether they are properly fituated; if they be loaded with cafks, they go in qneft
of ftones to prop them and prevent them from rolling. The elephant is not only
the mod tra&able, but the mod intelligent, of animals ;
fenfible of benefits, and
refentful of injuries. In India, they were once employed in the launching of
fhips: one was directed to force a very large veffel into the water; the work
proved fuperior to his drength ; his mader, with a farcadic tone, bade the keeper
take away this lazy bead and bring another: the poor animal indantly repeated his
efforts, fra&ured his fku.ll, and died on the fpot. In Delhi, an elephant, palling
along the dreets, put his trunk into a taylor’s fhop where feveral people were at
work; one of them pricked the end with his needle: the bead paffedon; but at
the next dirty puddle filled his trunk with water, returned to the fhop, and, fpurting
every drop among the people who had offended him, fpoiled their work. An
elephant in Adfmeer, which often palled through the bazar or market, as he went
by a certain herb-woman, always received from her a mouthful of greens: at
^ length
AND OCCULT SCIENCE. 95
length he was feized with one of his periodical fits of rage, broke his fetters, and,
running through the market, put the crowd to flight; among others, this woman,
who in hafte forgot a little child fhe had brought with her. The animal, recollecting
the fpot where his benefadrefs was wont to fit, took up the infant gently in his
truak, and placed it in fafety on a flail before a neighbouring houfe. Another,
in his madnefs, killed his cornac or governor: the wife, feeing the misfortnne,
took her two children and flung them before the elephant, faying, <{
Now you
have deltroyed their father, you may as well put an end to their lives and mine.”
It inflantly flopped, relented, took the greatefl of the children, placed him on
its neck, adopted him for his cornac, and never afterwards would permit any body
elfe to mount it. A foldier at Pondicherry, who was accuftomed, whenever he
received the portion that came to his fhare, to carry a certain quantity of it to one
of thefe animals, having one day drank rather too freely, and finding himfelf
purfued by the guards, who were going to take him to prifon, took refuge under the
elephant’s body, an d fell afleep. In vain did the guard try to force him from this
afylum, as the elephant protected him with his trunk. The next morning the fol-
dier, recovering from his drunken fit, fhuddered with horror to find himfelf
flretched under the belly of this huge animal. The elephant, who without
doubt perceived the man’s embarrafTment, careffed him with his trunk, in order
to infpire him with courage and make him underfland that he might now depart
in fafety. A painter was defirous of drawing the elephant which was kept in the
menagerie at Verfailles in an uncommon attitude, which was that of holding
his trunk raifed up in the air with his mouth open. The painter’s boy, in order
to keep the animal in this poflure, threw fruit into his mouth; but as fhe lad
frequently deceived him, and made an offer only of throwing him the fruit,
he grew angry; and, as if he had known that the painter’s intention of drawing
him was the caufe of the affront that was offered him, inflead of revenging him-
felf on the lad, he turned his refentment on the matter, and, taking up a quantity
of water in his trunk, threw it on the paper on which the painter was drawing,
and fpoiled it. At the Cape of Good Hope, it ir cuftomary to kill thofe
animals for the fake of their teeth, by the chafe. Three horfemen, well mounted
and armed with lances, attack the elephant alternately, each relieving the other
as they fee their companion preffed, till the beafl is fubdued. Three Dutch-
men (brothers), who had made large fortunes by this bufinefs, determined to
retire to Europe, and enjoy the fruits of their labours ; but refolved, before
they went, to have a laft chace by way of amufement: they met with their game,
and began the attack in the ufual manner; but unfortunately one of their horfes
fell
96 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
fell down and flung its rider: the enraged animal inftantly feized the unhappy man
with its trunk, flung him up to a vaft height in the air, and received him on one of
his tufks ; then turning towards the two other brethren, as if it were with an afpeCt
of revenge and infult, held out to them the impaled wretch writhing on the bloody
tooth.
When the elephant is properly managed, he lives very long even in a ftate of
flavery and labour. That fome have lived in this ftate an hundred and thirty years,
is pretty well authenticated. In a natural ftate they often exceed two hundred
years, and propagate their fpecies till they are an hundred and twenty : it is thirty
years before they come to their full growth. The mode of connection be-
tween the male and female is now afcertained beyond the poflibility of doubt;
as Mr. Buller, Lieut. Hawkins, and many others, faw a male copulate with a female,
after they were fecured, in the Eaft-Indies, in a manner exactly fimilar to the con-
junction of the horfe with a mare. This faCt entirely overturns what has been fo
often related concerning the fuppofed delicacy of this ufeful animal, and a variety
of other hypothefes, which are equally void of foundation. The time an elephant
goes with young, has been afcertained to be fomewhat lefs than two years, as an
elephant brought forth a young one twenty-one months and three days after fhe was
taken. She was cbferved to be with young in April or May 1788, and fhe was only
taken in January preceding; fo that it is very likely fhe muft have had '‘connection
with the male fome months before fhe was fecured, otherwife they could not difcover
that fhe was with young, as a fcetus of lefs than three months cannot well be fup-
pofed to make any alteration in the fize or fhape of fo large an animal. The young
one, a male, was produced October 16, 1789, and appeared in every refpeCt to
have arrived at its full time. He was thirty-five inches high at his birth, and grew
four inches in nearly as many months. Elephants are always meafured at the
fhoulder; for the arch or curve of the back, of young ones particularly, is confi-
derably higher than any other part, and it is a fure fign of old age whenever this
curve is found flattened or confiderably depreffed, after an elephant has once
attained its full growth. The young elephants fuck conftantly with their mouths,
and never with their trunks, as Buffon has aflerted; a conclufion he made merely
from conjeClure, and the great and various ufes to which the trunk is adapted
and applied by every elephant.—The approach of the rutting feafon is eafily
known; for fome days before it happens, an oily liquor flows from a fmall hole
on each fide of the head. The domeftic female on thefe occafions fometimes
makes her efcape, and joins the wild males in the woods. Some days afterward,
her cornac goes ia queft of her, and calls her by her name till fhe comes. She
fubmits to him with complacence, and allows herfelf to be conducted home, and
(hut
AND OCCULT SCIENCE. 97
(hut up in the liable. They bring forth but one at a time, though the female has
two dugs, one on each fide the breaft. The young one, as foon as it comes into the
world, is as large as a wild boar, and is furnilhed with teeth : however, the large
tufks do not make their appearance till fome time after, and at the age of fix
months they are feveral inches long. Elephants of this age are as large as an ox
when in a natural Hate.
The intrepidity and fagacity of the horfe, have been regarded with admiration
by all ranks of men, and in all ages of the world. Even in a domeftic flate he is
bold and fiery ; and, equally undaunted as his mailer, faces danger and death with
ardour and magnanimity. He delights in the noife and tumult of arms, and feems
to feel the glory of viflory: he exults in the chace; his eyes fparkle with emula-
tion in the courfe. But, though bold and intrepid, he is docile and tradable; he
knows how to govern and check the natural vivaeity and fire of his temper. He
not only yields to the hand, but feems to confult the inclination of his rider.
Conftantly obedient to the impreffions he receives, his motions are entirely regu-
lated by the will of his mailer. He in fome meafure refigns his very exillence to
the pleafure of man. He delivers up his whole powers, he referves nothing; he
will rather die than difobey. Who could endure to fee a charadler fo noble, abufed ?
Who could be guilty of fuch grofs barbarity ? none but wretches moll relentlefs
and unfeeling ! We need go no further than the horfe, to prove how ftrongly na-
ture has endowed brute animals with memory; for whatever roads, pallures, inns,
or ftables, a horfe has been accullomed to, though removed for years to a dillant
part of the country, he never forgets them; but if ever he returns, or paffes by
them again, he gives evident tokens that he has been accullomed to the place.
The celebrated equettrians, Hughes and Altley, could, I doubt not, furniffi a thou-
fand curious anecdotes to illuftrate this fa£l; but the following, I think, being in-
controvertible, will be fufficient for the purpofe.
Mr. James George, a gentleman of Southampton, in the county of Hants, loft
his horfe from off the common on which he had been accullomed to be turn-
ed out. About twelve months after, the horfe was feen and recognized, grazing
on a common near Burfledon. Soon as this was made known, Mr. George fent
his fervam with a bridle, and ordered the horfe to be caught, and brought home.
In a few days after, a Mr. Langtree of Burfledon came to Mr. George, to demand
the horfe, infilling it was his property, and had been fo for years. The horfe,
however, being pofitively withheld, Mr. Langtree brought an aftion for his re-
covery, which was tried at Winchefter Lentaflizes, in March 1789. The plaintiff,
on the pofitive affirmations of fix or feven witneffes, traced the fale of the
horfe from one dealer’s hands to another, as far back as the year 1784, when he
No. 7. C c '
was
tj% AKEYTOPHYSIC,
was purchafed of one farmer Mofes, in the county of Suffex, who bred him; and
the horfe was identified by them all. On the part of the defendant, the mofl po-
fitive evidence was adduced, to fhow that this horfe was not the horfe fworn to
Irave been fo bought and fold by the witnefles on the other fide, but was, and
had been, the real property of Mr. George, from the year 1786. In this fituation,
with the horfe equally fworn to and identified by the witneffes on both fides, who had
all been to infpefl him but the day before the trial, the judge, by crofs-examining
the lafl witnefs, difcovered, that when the defendant’s fervant brought the horfe back,
he turned him into his old paflurage on Southampton common, where he had not
been many minutes, before he fet off, of his own accord, towards Southampton;
and in his way croffed a number of lanes, and turnings, paffed by eight or ten Rabies,
until he came to the liable of Mr. George, where he inflantly flopped, and neighed
at the liable door, as much as to fay he was come back, and begged to be taken in k
This circumflance decided the verdiCl. The learned judge remarked, that there
could be no collufion in the evidence derived from the memory of the horfe
,
and di-
rected the jury to find for the defendant.
This charaCler, though natural to the animal, is improved by habit and education.
His education commences with the lofs of liberty, and is finifhed by conflraint. In
the vafl deferts of America, they roam at large without any reflraint. M. de Salle
relates, that he faw, in the year 1685, horfes feeding in the meadows of North
America, near the bay of St. Louis, which were fo ferocious that nobody durft
come near them. Oexmelin fays, that he has feen large troops of them in St. Do-
mingo running in the valleys; that, when any perfon approached, they all flopped;
and one of them would advance till within a certain dtflance, then fnort with his
nofe, take to his heels, and the whole troop after him. Thefe relations fufficiently
prove, that the horfe, when at full liberty, has no inclination to affociate with
mankind: that all the foftnefs and duCtility of his temper proceed entirely from
the culture and polifh he receives in his domeflic education, which in fome mea-
fure commences as foon. as he is brought forth.—The horfe has not only a gran-
deur in his general appearance, but there is the greatefl fymmetry and propor-
tion in the different parts of the body. The regularity and proportion of the dif-
ferent parts of the head gives him an air of lightnefs, which is well fupported by
the flrength and beauty of his chefl. He ereCls his head, as if willing to exalt
himfelf above the condition of other quadrupeds; his eyes are open and lively;
his ears are handfome, and of a proper height; his mane adorns his neck, and gives
him the appearance of flrength and boldnefs. At the age of two years, or
two years and an half, the horfe is in a condition to propagate; and the mare,
like mofl other females, is ready to receive him flill fooner. J3 ut the foals pro-

duced by fuch early embraces are generally ill made and weakly. The horfe
Ihould never be admitted to the mare till he is four or four and a half; this is
only meant with regard to draught-horfes. Fine horles (hould not be admitted to
the mare before they be fix years old; and Spanifh ftallions not till feven. The
mares are generally in feafon from the beginning of April to the end of June;
but their chief ardour for the horfe lafts only about fifteen or twenty days, and this
critical feafon fhould always be embraced. The ftallion ought to be found, well
made, vigorous, and of a good breed. For fine faddle-horfes, foreign ftallions,
as Arabians, Turks, Barbs, and Andalufians, are preferable to all others. Next
to tbefe, JBritifh ftallions are the beft; becaufe they originally fprang from thofe
above-mentioned, and are very little degenerated. The ftallions of Italy, and
efpecially the Neapolitans, are very good. The beft ftallions for draught or
carriage horfes, are thofe of Naples, Denmark, Holftein, and Friezeland. The
ftallions for faddle-horfes (hould be from fourteen to fifteen hands high, and for
draught-horfes at leaft fifteen hands. Neither ought the colour of ftallions to be
overlooked; as a fine black, grey, bay, forrel, chefnut, &c. Befides thefe external
qualities, a ftallion ought to have courage, traGability, Ipirit, agility, a fenfible
mouth, fure limbs, &c. Thefe precautions in the choice of a ftallion are the more
necefifary, becaufe he has been found by experience to communicate to his offspring
almoft all his good or bad qualities, whether natural or acquired.
To fhow, more obvioufly, the reafonmg faculty of brutes, and to diftinguifh
the operations of intellect from thofe of inftinG, we need only contemplate the
actions and difpofition of the dog. In a favage ftate, it muft be allowed, that
he is fierce, cruel, and voracious; but, when civilized and accullomed to live
with men, he is po fie fled of every amiable quality. He feems to have no other
defire than to pleafe and proteG his matter. He is gentle, obedient, fubmiftive,
and faithful. Thefe difpofitions, joined to his almoft unbounded fagacity, juftly
claim the efteem of mankind. Accordingly no animal is fo much carefled or
refpeGed : he is fo duGile, and fo much formed to pleafe, that he affumes the
very air and temper of the family in which he refides. An animal endowed with
fuch uncommon qualities, muft anfwer many ufeful purpofes. His fidelity and
vigilance are daily employed to proteG our perfons, our flocks, or our goods.
The acutenefs of his fmell gains him employment in hunting : he is frequently
employed as a turnfpit : at Brufiels and in Holland he is trained to draw little carts
to the herb-market; and in the northern regions draws a fledge with his matter in
it, or loaden with provifions. It is a remarkable inftinG in the dog, that when op-
preffed with ficknefs, to which he is very fubjeG, efpecially in the beginning of
fummer, and before ill weather, in order to procure him a puke, he eats the leaves
of

•of the quicken grafs, the bearded wheat-grafs, or the rough cock’s-foot grass,
which gives him immediate relief. He does not throw out his excrements promif-
cuoufly upon every thing that happens to be in the way, but carefully feeks Hones,
trunks of trees, or barren places. This is a wife inftitution of nature ; for the ex-
crements of a dog deltroy almoft every vegetable or animal fubftance. They are of
fuch a putrid nature, that, if a man’s fhoe touches them when recently expelled, that
particular part will rot in a few days. He obferves the fame method in making his
urine, which he throws out at a fide. It is remarkable, that a dog will not pafs a
{lone or a wall againft which any other dog has pitted, without following his exam-
ple, although an hundred fhould occur in a few minutes, infomuch that it is afto-
niffiing how fuch a quantity can be fecreted in fo ffiort a time. The principal ob-
jection to dogs, is the {hocking circumllance of their going mad, and of commu-
nicating “the diforder to whatever perfon, or animal, they may chance to bite; and of
which the cure has ever been confidered precarious and uncertain. From a minute
invelligation of the poifonous qualities of the hydrophobia, and the effeCl it has on
the blood, as well as from a corjfideration of what the blood and juices undergo
by emerging the body in the fea, I am bold to affirm that my Solar Tinflure, ad-
miniftered in the way I have direCled, is a certain and infallible cure for this de-
plorable malady; at lead as far as human certainty can go with refpeft to medi-
cine. I would not however be underftood to encourage a negligence in tbofe who
keep dogs, to watch well their actions, and, on the fmalleft fufpicion that fuch a
misfortune is near, to have them inftantly difpatched, as they may be eafily re-
placed, and much anxiety and diftrefs prevented.—With regard to the propagation
of dogs, the females admit the males before they are twelve months old. They
remain in feafon ten, twelve, or even fifteen, days, during which time they will
admit a variety of males. They come in feafon generally twice in the year, and
more frequently in the cold than in the hot months. The male difcovers the con-
dition of the female by the fmell ; but ffie feldom admits him the firft fix or feven
days. One coition will make her conceive a great number of young; but, when
not reftrained, ffie will admit feveral dogs every day ; ffie feems to have no choice
or predile&ion, except in favour of large dogs; from this circumftance it fome-
times happens, that a fmall female, who has admitted a maftiff, periffies in bring-
ing forth her young. During the time of copulation, thefe animals cannot fepa-
rate themfelves, but remain united fo long as the ere&ion fubfifts. This is owing
to the ftruflure of the parts. The dog has not only a bone in his penis, but in the
middle of the corpus cavernofum there is a large hollow, which is blown up in the
time of ere£lion to a confiderable bulk. The female, on the other hand, has a
larger clitoris than perhaps any other animal : befides, a large firm protuberance
rife#
AND OCCULT SCIENCE. id
rlfes in the time of copulation, and remains perhaps longer than that of the male, and
prevents him from retiring till it fubfides ;
accordingly, after the aft of penetrating
is effefted, the male turns about in order to reft himfelf on his legs, and remains
in that pofidon till the parts turn flaccid. The female goes with young about nine
weeks. They generally bring forth from fix to twelve puppies. Tliofe of a fmall
fize bring forth five, four, and fometimes but two. They continue to copulate and
bring forth during lffe, which lafts generally about fourteen or fifteen years. The
whelps are commonly blind, and cannot open their eyes till the tenth or twelfth
day; the males are like the dog, the females like the bitch.—The dog, the wolf,
and the fox, are certainly derived from one original parent; and all dogs whatfo-
ever, from the terrible boar-dog to Pompey the little, were all one in the firft
creation. All the variety we behold in them, is either produced by change of
climate, of the accidental effeft of foil, food, or fituation; or from the iffue of hu-
man care, experiment : or caprice. Every huntfman knows what a vaft alteration
may be made in dogs, by induftrioufly improving the breed, for twenty or thirty
years. Nature wifely tends to render every kind of creature fit for the country
where it is to inhabit, or be employed, which is the reafon why hounds, and all
other animals, degenerate, by being removed into contrary climates. This is ma-
nifeft from the following experiment; if a couple of right fouthern hounds be re-
moved to the north, and differed to propagate without art or mixture, they will,
by fenfible degrees, decline into lighter bodies, and fhriller accents ; and in the
lame way are all dogs varied, by being carried from one country to another.
But the utmoft efforts of human induftry and contrivance, whether aflifted by
change of climate, or mixture of breed, could never add one new fpecies to the
works of the creation. Nature is ftill uniform as to the main, nor fuffers the
Almighty Creator to be imitated by fhort-fighted mortals. In fpi’te of art, our
mules are always barren; nor can the mod curious projeftor produce one amphi-
geneous animal that will increafe and multiply. There appears a diftinft fpecific
difference in all living creatures ; the horfe, the dog, the bear, the goat, how-
ever diverfified by art, by copulation, or by climate, either in fize, fhape, or
figure, will ever difcover fomething that approximates to the charafter of their
fpecies. Above all, the peculiar inltinft and appetite for generation, will prompt
them to own and indicate their relation. Animals of different fpecies will never
copulate together. This is one of the moft undeniable arguments that wolves,
foxes, and dogs, are originally the fame fpecies, becaufe in coition they are not
• only all held together in the fame manner, but we have frequent inftances of litters
of puppies both from the dog and fox, and from the dog and wolf. Mr. Brooke,
animal-merchant in Holborn, turned a wolf to a Pomeranian bitch in heat;

the congrefs was immediate, and as ufual between dog and bitch : fhe produc ed
ten puppies. Mr. Pennant faw one of them at Gordon Caftle, that had very
much the refemblance of a wolf, and alfo much of its nature; being flipped at
a weak deer, it inflantly caught at the animal’s throat and killed it. I could not
learn (fays Mr. Pennant) whether this mongrel continued its fpecies; but another
of the fame kind did, and flocked the neighbourhood of Fochabers, in. the county
of Moray, (where it was kept,) with a multitude of curs of a moft wolfifli afpeCl.
There was lately living a mongrel offspring of this kind. It greatly refembled its
wolf parent. It was firft the property of Sir Wolftein Dixey; afterwards of Sir
Willoughby Afton. During day it was very tame; but at night fometimes relapfed
into ferocity. It never barked, but rather howled; when it came into fields
where fheep were, it would feign lamenefs, but if no one was prefent would inftantly
attack them. It had been feen in copulation with a bitch, which afterwards pupped:
the breed was imagined to refemble in many refpefts the fuppofed fire. It died be-
tween the age of five and fix.—The woodman of the manor of Mongewell, in Ox-
fordfhire, has a bitch, which conftantly follows him, the offspring a tame dog-fox
by a fhepherd’s cur; and fhe again has had puppies by a dog. Since there are fuch
authentic proofs of the further continuance of the breed, we may furely add the
wolf and fox to the other fuppofed flocks of thefe faithful domeftics, particularly as
moft naturalifts fuppofe the dog to have been originally the production of one or
other of thefe animals, tamed and civilized.
Many and wonderful are the inftances of fagacity, fidelity, and attention, and
even of forefight, which thefe faithful animals have evinced towards their mailers*
Some fuch will doubtlefs occur to the minds of my readers, as falling under their
own obfervation ; I fhall therefore only recite two or three fuch inftances, of un-
queftionable authenticity. —In the year 1791, a perfon went to a houfe in Dept-
ford, to take lodgings, under pretence that he was juft arrived from the Welt-
Indies; and after having agreed on terms, faid he fnould fend in his trunk that
night, and come himfelf the next day. About nine o’clock in the evening, the
trunk was brought in by two porters, and was carried into his bed-room. Juft
as the family were going to bed, their little houfe-dog, deferting his ufual
ftation in the fhop, placed himfelf clofe to the chamber door, where the cheft
was depofited, and kept up an inceffant barking. The moment the chamber
door was opened, the dog flew to the cheft, againft which it barked and
fcratched with redoubled vehemence and fury. At firft they tried to get the
dog out of the room ; but in vain. Calling in fome neighbours, and making
them eye-witneffes of the circumftance, they began to move the trunk about,
when they quickly difeovered that it contained fomething alive. Sufpicion

falling very ftrong, they were induced to open it, when, to their utter aflonifhment,
who fhould prefent himfelf but their new lodger, who had been thus conveyed in,
to rob the houfe!—In the fummer of the year 1792, a gentleman went down to
Portfmouth for the benefit of lea-bathing. He went to Mr. Bradley’s machines,
to be conduced into the water. Being unacquainted with the depth of the water,
and no fwimmer, he found himfelf, the inllant he quitted the machine, nearly out
of his depth. Fright increafed the peril of his fituation, and, unnoticed by the
perfon who attends the machines, he had funk for the laft time in the agonies of
drowning. A large Newfoundland dog, Handing by accident on the Ihore, and
feeing the diftrefs of this ftranger, plunged in after him ; and, feizing him by the
hair of the head, conduced him fafely on-fhore, though it was fome time before
he recovered. The gentleman afterwards purchafed the dog at a high price, but
values him equally with the fum total of his fortune. —At the feat of the late Earl
of Litchfield, three miles from Blenheim, there is a portrait in the dining-room
of Sir Henry Lee, by Johnlton, with that of a maftiff dog which faved his life.
It feems a fervant had formed the defign of alfafiinating his mailer and robbing
the houfe j but the night he had fixed on, the dog, which had never been much
noticed by Sir Henry, for the firlt time followed him up-llairs, got under his bed,
and could not be got from thence by either mailer or man; in the dead of night,
the fame fervant entered the room to execute his horrid defign, but was inltantly
feized by the dog, and, being fecured, confelfed his intentions. There are ten
quaint lines in one corner of the piflure, which conclude thus
:
But in my dog, whereof I made no llore,
I find more love than thofe I trulled more.
Upon what hypothefis can we account for a degree of forefight and penetration
fuch as this? Or will it be fuggelled, as a folution of the difficulty, that a dog
may poffibly become capable in a great meafure of underllanding human difcourfe,
and of reafoning and a£ting accordingly ; and that, in the prefent inltance, the
villain had either uttererj his defign in foliloquy, or imparted it to an accomplice,
in the hearing of the animal ? It has been much difputed whether the brutes have
any language whereby they can exprefs their minds to each other; or whether all
the noife they make confilts only of cries inarticulate, and unintelligible even to
themfelves. We may indeed, from analogy, conclude, with great reafon, that
fome of the cries of bealls are really expreffions of their fentiments; but whether
one bead is capable of forming a defign, and communicating that defign by any
kind of language to others, is what I lhall leave to the judgment of the reader,
after fubmitting to his confideration the following inftance.—A fparrow finding a
neft
104 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
neft that a martin had juft built, (landing very conveniently for him, poflefled
himfelf of it. The marlin, feing the ufurper in her houfe, called for help to
expel him. A thoufand martins came full fpeed, and attacked the fparrow ; but
the latter being covered on every fide, and prefenting only his large beak at the
entrance of the neft, was invulnerable, and made the boldeft of them who durft
approach him repent of their temerity. After a quarter of an hour’s combat, all
the martins difappeared. The fparrow thought he had got the better, and the fpefta-
tors judged that the martins had abandoned their undertaking. Not in the lead.
Immediately they returned to the charge ;
and, each of them having procured a
little of that tempered earth with whith they make their nefts, they all at once fell
upon the fparrow, and inclofed him in the neft to perifh there, though they could
not drive him thence. Can it be imagined that the martins could have been able
to hatch and concert this defign all of them together, without fpeaking to each
other, or without fome medium of communication equivalent to language ?
From all thefe extraordinary endowments, manifefted by brute animals of differ-
ent countries and kinds, fome philofophers have maintained that brutes are endowed
with a foul, though effentially inferior to that of men ; and to this foul they
have allowed immortality. Father Bougeant, a Jefuit, has lately published a
treatife exprefsly on this fubjeft, entitled, A Philofophical Amufement on the Language
of Brutes,
in which he affirms that they are animated by evil fpirits, or devils:
The ftrangenefs of this doctrine has induced me to give the outline of his argu-
ments, fince it cannot fail to prove entertaining to the reader. “ Reafon (fays
he) naturally inclines us to believe that beafts have a fpiritual foul; and the only
thing that oppofes this fentiment is, the confequences that might be inferred from
it. If brutes have a foul, that foul muft be either matter or fpirit; it muft be one
of the two, and yet you dare affirm neither. You dare not fay it is a matter, be-
caufe you muft then neceffarily fuppofe matter to be capable of thinking; nor will
you fay that it is fpirit, this opinion bringing with it confequences contrary to the
principles of religion ; and this, among others, that man would differ from beafts
only by the degrees of plus and minus ; which would demolilh the very foundation
of all religion. Therefore, if I can elude all thefe confequences ; if I can affign
to beafts a fpiritual foul, without ftriking at the doctrines of religion ; it is evident*
that my fyftem, being moreover the molt agreeable to reafon, is the only warrant-
able hypothefis. Now I (hall, and can do it, with the greateft eafe imaginable.
I even have means, by the fame method, to explain many very obfeure paffages in
the Holy Scriptures,' and to refolve fome very great difficulties which are not well
confuted. This I (hall unfold in a more particular manner. Religion teaches
us*
AND OCCULT SCIENCE. 105
us, that the devils, from the very moment they had finned, were reprobate, and
that they were doomed to burn for ever in hell; but the church has not yet deter-
mined whether they do ablually endure the torments to which they are condemned.
Tt may then be thought that they do not yet fuffer them, and that the execution of
the verdibt brought againft them is referved for the day of final judgement. —Now
what I pretend to infer from hence is, that, till doomfday comes, God, in order
not fo fuffer fo many legions of reprobate fpirits to be of no ufe, has diftributed
them through the feveral fpaces of the world, to ferve the defigns of his Provi-
dence and make his omnipotence to appear. Some, continuing in their natural
ftate, bufy themfelves in tempting men, in feducing and tormenting them; either
immediately, as Job’s devil, and thofe that lay hold of human bodies; or by the
miniftry of force re rs or phantoms. Thefe wicked fpirits are thofe vihom the ferip-
ture calls the powers of darknefs, or the powers of the air. God, with the others,
makes millions of beafts of all kinds, which ferve for the ufes of men, which fill
the univerfe, and caufe the wifdom and omnipotence of the Creator to be admired.
By that means I can eafily conceive, on the one hand, how the devils can tempt us;
and on the other, how beafts can think, know, have fentiments, and a
fpiritual foul, without any way ftriking at the dobtrines of religion. I. am no
longer furprifed to fee them have forecaft, memory, and judgement. I fhould
rather have occafion to wonder at their having no more, fince their foul very likely
is more perfebt than our?. But I difeover the reafon of this : it is becaufe, in beafts
as well as in ourfelves, the operations of the mind are dependent on the material
organs of the machine to which it is united; and thofe organs being grolfer and
lefs perfebt than in us, it follows, that the knowledge, the thoughts, and tire
other fpiritual operations, of beafts, muft of courfe be lefs perfebl than ours:
and if thefe proud fpirits know their own difmal ftate, what an humiliation muft
it be to them thus to fee themfelves reduced to the condition of beafts! But whe-
ther they know it or no, fo fhameful a degradation is ft ill, with regard to them,
the primary eftebt of the divine vengeance I juft mentioned; it is an anticipated
hell.”—Having mentioned the prejudices againft this hypothefts, fuch particular-
ly as the pleafure which people of fenfe and religion take in beafts and birds, efpe-
cially all forts of domeftic animals; he proceeds, “‘Do we love beafts for their
own fakes? No. As they are altogether ftrangers to human fociety, they can have
no other appointment but that of being ufeful and amufing. And what carp we
whether it be a devil or any other creature that amufes us? The thought of it,
far from (hocking, pleafes me mightily. I with gratitude admire the goodnefs
of the Creator, who gave me fo many little devils to ferve and amufe me. If I am
told that thefe poor devils are doomed to fuffer eternal tortures, I admire Godls
No. 7. E e decrees,,
106 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
decrees, but I have no manner of {hare in that dreadful fentence 5 I leave the
execution of it to the fovereign judge; and, notwithftanding this, I live with
my little devils as I do with a multitude of people, of whom religion informs me
that a great number (hall be damned. But the cure of a prejudice is not to be
cffe&ed in a moment; it is done by time and refleblion: give me leave then lightly
to touch upon this difficulty, in order to obferve a very important thing to you.
Perfuaded as we are that beafts have intelligence, have we not all of us a thoufand
times pitied them for the exceffive evils which the majority of them are expofed to,
and in reality fuffer? How unhappy is the condition of horfes ! We are apt to fay
upon feeing a horfe whom an unmerciful carman is murdering with blows. How
milerable is a dog whom they are breaking for hunting! How difmal is the fate of
beafts living in woods; they are perpetually expofed to the injuries of the weather,
alwaysfeized with apprehenfions of becoming the prey ofhunters,or of fome wilder
animal ; lor ever obliged, after long fatigue, to look out for fome poor infipid
food ; often fuffering cruel hunger; and fubjeft, moreover, to illnefs and death!
If men are fubjebl to a multitude of miferies that overwhelm them, religion ac-
quants us with the reafon of it; viz. the being born Tinners. But what crimes can
beafts have committed by birth to be fubjeQ: to evils fo very cruel ? What are we,
then, to think of the horrible excefles of miferies undergone by beafts? miferies
indeed, far greater than thofe endured by men. This is, in any other fyftem, an
incomprehenftble myftery ; whereas nothing is more eafy to be conceived from the
fyftem 1 propofe. The rebellious fpirits deferve a punifliment ftill more rigorous,
and happy is it for them that their puniffiment is deferred. In a word, God’s
goodnefs is vindicated, man himfelf is juftified: for what right can we have,
without neceffity, and often in the way of mere diverfion, to take away the life of
millions of beafts, if God had not authorised us fo to do ? And, beafts being as
fenfible as ourfelves of pain and death, bow could a juft and merciful God have
given man that privilege, if they were not fo many guilty victims of the divine
vengeance ?—But hear ftill Something more convincing, and of greater confe-
quence: beafts, by nature, are extremely vicious. We know well that they
never fin, becaufe they are not free; but this is the only condition wanting to
make them Sinners. The voracious birds and beafts of prey are cruel. Many
infe&s of one and the fame Species devour one another. Cats are perfidious and
ungrateful; monkeys are miSchievous; and dogs envious. All beafts in general
are jealous -and revengeful to excefs; not to mention many other vices we obferve
in them; and at the fame time that they are by nature fo very vicious, they have,
fay we, neither the liberty nor any helps to refift the bias that hurries them into
fo many bad actions. They are, according to the fchools, neceffitated to do evil*
to
AND OCCULT SCIENCE. 107
to difconcert the general order, to commit whatever is moft contrary to the notion
we have of natural juftice and to the principles of virtue. What monfters are
thefe in a world originally created for order and juflice to reign in ? This is, in
good part, what formerly perfuaded the Manicheans, that there were of neceffity
two orders of things, one good, and the other bad ;
and that the beads were not
the work of the good principle : a monftrous error ! But how then {hall we be-
lieve that beads came out of the hands of their Creator with qualities fo very
ftrange! If man is fo very wicked and corrupt, it isbecaufe he has himfelf through
fin perverted the happy nature God bad given him at his creation. Of two things,
then, we mutt fay one : either that God has taken delight in making beafts fo vi-
cious as they are, and of giving us in them models of what is molt fhameful in
the world; or that they have, like man, original fin, which has perverted their pri-
mitive nature.—The firft of thefe propofitions finds very difficult accefs to the
mind, and is an exprefs contradi&ion to the Holy Scriptures; which fay, that what-
ever came out of God’s hands, at the time of the creation of the world, was good,
yea very good. What good can there be in a monkey’s being fo very mifchievous,
a dog fo full of envy, a cat fo malicious ? But then many authors have pretended,
that beafts, before man’s fall, were different from what they are now ; and that it
was in order to punifli man that they became fo wicked. But this opinion is a mere
fuppofition, of which there is not the leaft footftep in holy fcripture. It is a piti-
ful fubterfuge to elude a real difficulty : this at moft might be faid of the beafts
with whom man has a fort of correfpondence ; but not at all of the birds, fifties,
and infedts, which have no manner of relation to him. We rauft then have re-
courfe to the fecond propofition, that the nature of beafts has, like that of man,
been corrupted by fome original fin : another hypothefis, void of foundation, and
equally inconfiftent with reafon and religion, in all the fyftems which have been
hitherto efpoufed concerning the fouls of beafts. What party are we to take ?
Why, admit of my fyftem, and all is explained. The fouls of beafts are refrac-
tory fpirits which have made themfelves guilty towards God. The fin in beafts
is no original fin ; it is a perfonal crime, which has corrupted and perverted their
nature in its whole fubftance; hence all the vices and corruption we obferve in
them, though they can be no longer eriminal, becaufe God, by irrecoverably re-
probating them, has at the fame time diverted them of their liberty.”
Thefe quotations contain the ftrength of Father Bougeant’s hypothefis, which alfo
hath had its followers -; but the reply to it is obvious. Beafts, though remarkably
mifchievous, are: not completely fo; they are in many iriftances capable of grati-
tude and love, which devils cannot poffibly be. The very fame paflions that are
in the brutes exift in the human nature; and if we chofe to argue from the
exiftencc
i-c8 A KEY TO PHY SI C,
exigence of thofe paffions, and the afcendency they have over mankind at force-
times, we may fay with as great juftice, that the fouls of men are devils, as that
the fouls of brutes are. All that can be reafonably inferred from the greater pre-
valency of the malignant paffions among the brutes than among men, is, that the
former have lefs rationality than men: and accordingly it is found, that among
favages, who exercife their reafon lefs than other men, every fpecies of barbarity
is praffifed, without being deemed a crime. —Upon the- whole, it is impoffible
to deduce this variety of aOion, in animals, from a general and uniform inftinfl
only. For they accommodate their operations to times and circumftances. They
combine; they choofe the favourable moment; they avail themfelves of the
occafion, and feem to receive fnftru&ion by experience. Many of their operations
announce refleftion : the bird repairs a (hattered neft, inftead of conllrufiling in-
itin&ively a new one : the ben, who has been robbed of her eggs, changes her
place in order to lay the remainder with more fecurity : the cat difcovers both
care and artifice in concealing her kittens. Again it is eyident, that, on many
occafions, animals know their faults and miftakes, and correfil them; they fome-
times contrive the molt ingenious methods of obtaining their ends, and when one
method fails, have recourfe to another; and they have, without doubt, a kind of
language for the mutual communication of their ideas. How is all this to be ac-
counted for, unlefs we fuppofe them endowed with the powers of perceiving,
thinking, remembering, comparing, and judging?' They certainly have thefe
powers, in a degree inferior to the human fpecies, and form clalfes below them in
the graduated fcale of intelligent beings; but, their actions not being directed to
moral ends, are confequently not accountable and proper fubje&s for reward or
punifhment in a future world.
After all, it does not appear upon what principle of reafon and juftiqe it is
?
that mankind have founded their right over the lives of every creature that is placed
in a fubordinate rank of being to themfelves. Whatever claim they may have in
right of food and felf-defence, did they extend their privilege no farther, number-
less beings might enjoy their lives in peace, who are now hurried out of them by
the molt wanton and unnecelfary cruelties. It is furely difficult to difcover why
it ffiould be thought lefs inhuman to cruffi to death a harmlefs infe£t, whofe fingle
offence is that he eats that food which nature has prepared for his fuftenance, than:
it would be were we to kill any bulky creature for the fame reafon. There are
few tempers fo hardened againft the impreffions of humanity, as not to ffiudder at
the thought of the latter; and yet the former is univerfally pra&ifed, without the
leaft check of compaffion. This feems to arife from the grofs error of fuppofing,
’hat every creature is really in itfelf contemptible, which” happens to be clothed
with
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 109
with a body infinitely difproportionate to our own, not confidering that great
and little are merely relative terms. But the inimitable Shakefpeare would teach
us, that-
the poor beetle that we tread upon,
In corp’ral fuff’rance feels a pang as great
As when a giant dies.
And, indeed, there is every reafion to believe, that the fenfations of many infe<5ts
are as requifite as thofe of creatures of far more enlarged dimenfions, perhaps
even more fo. The millepede, for indance, rolls itfelf round upon the flighted
touch; and the fnail gathers in her horns upon the lead approach of our hand.
Are not thefe the dronged indications of their fenfibility ? and is it any evidence
of ours, that we are not therefore induced to treat them with a more fympathifing
tendernefs?
I cannot conclude thefe obfervations on the indin&'and oeconomy of brute
animals, without reciting the following molt remarkable account of the land-
crab, which inhabits the Bahama Iflands, as well as mod parts between the
tropics, and feeds upon vegetables. Thefe creatures live not only in a kind of
orderly fociety in their retreats in the mountains, but regularly, once a-year, march
down to the fea-fide in a body of feme millions at a time. As they multiply in
great numbers, they choofe the month of April or May to begin their expedition ;
and then fally out by thoufands from the dumps of hollow trees, from the clefts
of rocks, and from the holes which they dig for themfelves under the furface of
the earth. At that time the whole ground is covered with this band of adven-
turers ;
there is no fetting down one’s foot without treading upon them. The
fea is their place of dedination, and to that they cliredt their march with right-
lined precifion. No geometrician could fend them to their dedined dation by a
fliorter courfe; they turn neither to the right nor to the left, whatever obdacles
intervene; and, even if they meet with a houfe, they will attempt to fcale the
walls to keep the unbroken tenor of their wT
ay. But, though this be the general
order of their route, they upon other occafions are obliged to conform to
the face of the country; and, if it is interfered with rivers, they are then feen
to wind along the courfe of the dream. The proceflion fets forward from the
mountains with the regularity of an army under the guidance of an experienced
commander. They are commonly divided into three battalions; of which the
fird confids of the dronged and bolded males, that, like pioneers, march for-
ward to clear the w'ay, and face the greated dangers. Thefe are often obliged
to halt for want of rain, and to go into the mod convenient encampment till
No. 8.. F f .

the weather changes. The main body of the army is compofed of females,
which never leave the mountains till the rain has fet in for fome time, and then
defcend in regular battalia, being formed into two columns of fifty paces broad,
and three miles deep, and fo clofe that they almoft cover the ground. Three
or four days after this, the rear guard follows, a ftraggling undifciplined tribe,
confifting of males and females, but neither fo robuft nor fo vigorous as the
former. The night is their chief time of proceeding; but, if it rains by day,
they do not fail to profit by the occafion ; and they continue to move for-
ward in their flow uniform manner. When the fun fliines and is hot upon
the furface of the ground, they then make an univerfal halt, and wait till the
cool of the evening. When they are terrified, they march back in a confufed
disorderly manner, holding up their nippers, with which they fometimes tear
off a piece of the fkin, and then leave the weapon where they infli6ted the
wound. They even try to intimidate their enemies; for they often clatter
their nippers together, as if it were to threaten thofe that come to diflurb them.
But, though they thus flrive to be formidable to man, they are much more
fo to each other ;
for they are poffeffed of one moft unfocial property,' which
is, that, if any of them by accident is maimed in fuch a manner as to be inca-
pable of proceeding, the reft fall upon and devour it on the fpot, and then
purfue their journey.—When, after a fatiguing march, and efcaping a thou-
fand dangers, (for they are fometimes three months in getting to the fhore,)
they have arrived at their deftined port, they prepare to caft their fpawn.
The peafe are as yet within their bodies, and not excluded, as is ufual in ani-
mals of this kind, under the tail; for the creature waits for the benefit of
fea-water to help the delivery. For this purpofe the crab has no fooner reached
the fhore, than it eagerly goes to the edge of the water, and lets the waves
wafh over its body two or three times. This feems only a preparation for
bringing their fpawn to maturity ;
for, without further delay, they withdraw
to*feek a lodging upon land. In the mean time the fpawn grows larger, is ex-
cluded out of the body, and fticks to the barbs under the flap, or more pro-
perly the tail. This bunch is feen as big as a hen’s egg, and exa&ly refem-
bling the roes of herrings. In this ftate of pregnancy they once more feek
the lhore for the laft time; and, fhaking oflf their fpawn into the water, leave
accident to bring it to maturity. At this time whole fhoals of hungry fifh
are at the fhore in expe&ation of this annual fupply; the feu. to a great diftance
feems black with them ;
and about two thirds of the crabs’ eggs are immediately
devoured by thefe rapacious invaders. The eggs that efcape are hatched under
the fand; and, foon after, millions at a time of the little crabs are feen quitting the
fhore,
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. hi
ihore, and {lowly travelling up to the mountains. The old ones, however, are not
fo adtive to return ;
they have become fo feeble and lean, that they can hardly
creep along, and their flelh at that time changes its colour. The moil of them,
therefore, are obliged to continue in the flat parts of the country till they recover,
making holes in the earth, which they cover at the mouth with leaves and dirt,
fo that no air may enter. There they throw off their old fhells, which they leave,
as it w'ere, quite whole ;
the place where they opened on the belly being unfeen.
At that time they are quite naked, and almoft without motion for fix days together,
when they become fo fat as to be delicious food. They have then under their
ftomachs four large white Hones, which gradually decreafe in proportion as the
fhell hardens, and, when they come to perfedtion, are not to be found. It is at
that time that the animal is feen flowly making its way back ; and all this is moft
commonly performed in the fpace of fix weeks.—This animal, when polfi fled of
its retreats in the mountains, is impregnable; for only fubfifting on vegetables,
it feldom ventures out ;
and, its habitation being in the moft inacceftible places,
it remains for a great part of the feafon in perfedt fecurity. It is only when im-
pelled by the defire of bringing forth its young, and when compelled to defeend
into the flat country, that it is taken. At that time the natives wait for its
defeent in eager expedtation, and deftroy thoufands ;
but, difregarding their
bodies, they only feek for that fmall fpawn which lies on each fide the ftomach
within the fhell, of about the thicknefs of a man’s thumb. They are much
more valuable upon their return after they have caft their fhell ;
for, being co-
vered with a fkin refembling foft parchment, almoft every part except the ftomach
may be eaten. They are taken in the holes by feeling for them with an inftru-
ment; they are fought after by night, when on their journey, by flambeaux. The
inftant the animal perceives itfelf attacked, it throws itfelf on its back, -
and with
its claws pinches moft terribly whatever it happens to fallen on. But the dexte-
rous crab-catcher takes them by the hinder legs in fuch a manner that the nip-
pers cannot touch them, and thus he throws them into his bag. Sometimes alfo
they are caught, when they take refuge in the bottoms of holes in rocks by the
fea-fide, by clapping a Hick to the mouth of the hole, w'hich prevents their get-
ting out ;
and then foon after, the tide coming, enters the hole, and the animal
is found, upon its retiring, drowned in its retreat.—Thefe crabs are of various
fizes, the largeft about fix inches wide ;
they walk fide-ways like the fea-crab, and
are fhaped like it: fome are black, fome are yellow, fome red, and others
variegated with red, 'white, and yellow, mixed. Some of thefe are poifonous ;
and feveral people have died of eating of the crabs, particularly of the black kind.

Of SCENT.
NOTHING more eminently demonftrates the dodtrine of atoms, than fcent.
It is an effluvium continually arifing from the corpufcles that iifue out of all
bodies; and, being impregnated with the peculiar ftate and quality of the blood
and juices of that particular animal from which they flow, occafions the vaft
variety of fmells or fcents cognizable by the olffidtory nerves," or organs of
fmelling. Hence the reafon why one perfon differs from another in fcent; and
why a dog will trace the footfteps of his mafter for a hundred miles together, fol-
low him into any houfe, church, or other building, and diftinguifli him from every
other perfon, though furrounded by ten thoufand; and when the faithful animat
has thus diligently fought out and recognifed his mafter, he is feldom willing'
even to truft the evidence of his own eyes, until, with eredted ereft, he has taken
a few cordial fniffs, to convince himfelf he is right. Hence alfo we perceive how
a pack of hounds are enabled to purfue the hare, fox, ftag, or any other animal*
they are trained to hunt, acrofs the fcent, and amidft the fociety of others of the
fame fpecies, without being diverted from the purfuit of that felf-fame animal
they had JirJi on foot. And hence too we difeover how it is poffible for birds and'
beafts of prey to be diredted to their food at fuch vaft diftances; for thefe corpufcles,
iffuing from putrid bodies, and floating in the air, are carried by the wind to dif-
ferent quarters; and, ftriking the olfaftory nerves of whatever animals they meet'
in their way,*' immediately conduct them to the fpot. It matters not how much the
effluvia may be gone off, fo as enough remains to irritate the olfa6tory organ ;
for*
whether it be biid or beaft, they try the fcent in all diretftions, till at length they,
difeover that which is ftronger and ftronger in proportion as they proceed ; and
this nature has taught them to know is the diredl and obvious road to their prey,,
and prevents them from following the contrary courfe, which is naturally weaker
and weaker, and what in hunting is termed heel. This obfervation is con-
firmed by the increafed eagernefs we perceive in all animals, the nearer they,
approach the object of purfuit; as we fee honnds*and fpaniels in hunting and.

footing, are the more earneft, in proportion as the fcent is recent, and as they draw
nearer to the game. The fame thing, amongft quadrupeds, whether wild or
domeftic, dire&s the male to the female that is in feafon for love; and hence
we fee the dog, the boar, the bull, and the' ftallion, when turned loofe, apply their
noftrils to the ambient air, and proceed accordingly. By the fame medium the ver-
min which infeft our dwellings know how to dire6t their operations, whether to un-
dermine walls, eat through folid boards, crols rivers, or climb fpouts; which fhows
how much ftronger the faculty of fmelling is polfelfed by the brute fpecies than
by the human ;
wifely ordained by nature, to enable them to feek their food, and
propagate their fpecies, but for which they would often perifli, or have long fince
become extindt.
There are wonderful inflances of fome animal carcafes, which, though flaked
with lime, and buried ten feet under ground, have fent forth fo ftrong a fcent as
to have attracted dogs to the fpot, that eagerly endeavoured to dig away the earth
to get at them. And an inftance happened only a few years fince at Petersfield
in Hampfliire, where an unfortunate female, having privately delivered herfelf of
two children, went and buried them in a deep hole in an adjoining field; but
within three days fome dogs were attra6led to the fpot by the fcent, dug them up,
and partly devoured them before the fliocking circumftance was difcovered. No
wonder then a pack of hounds, which have caught the fcent of a polecat or weafel,
will purfue it into the thickeft foreft, and affemble round the very tree up
the trunk of which it had run for fhelter ; or that blood-hounds, as in
times of old, fliould trace out fugitives and robbers in fubterraneous caverns, in
trees, caves, or forefts, or in clefts of inacceflible rocks, of which inflances are
given by the moft reputable hiftorians. It is however to be remarked, that, as all
animals hunt for and purfue their prey by its fcent, fo they feem inftinftively
to know, that they themfelves are hunted and purfued by means of the fcent
iffuing from their own bodies. But, as this fubje<5t admits of fo much curious
and occult fpeculation, I fliall give a few inflances of the effe6ts of fcent upon dif-
ferent animals, and the fenfe and fagacity they difplay in the management of it.
—
And firft, of the hare.
The hare is naturally a timid animal, but emanates a very ftrong fcent. He
fleeps in his form or feat during the day; and feeds, copulates, &c. in the
night. In a moon-light evening, a number of them are fometimes feen fport-
ing together, leaping and purfuing each other: but the leaft motion, the falling
of a leaf, alarms them ;
and then they all run off feparately, each taking a
different route. They are extremely fwift in their motion, which is a kind of
gallop, or a fucceftion of quick leaps. When purfued, they always take to the
No. 8. G g higher
114 A KEY TO PHYSIC
higher grounds : as their fore feet are much fliorter than the hind ones, they
run with more eafe up-hill than down-hill. The hare is endowed with all thofe
inftindts which are neceffary for his own prefervation. In winter he choofes a
form expofed to the fouth, and in fu miner to the north ; and has a thoufand
contrivances to elude the vigilance of his purfuers, and to cut off his fcent
from the hounds. If it be rainy, the hare ufually takes to the highways
;
and if fhe come to the fide of a young grove, or fpring, fhe feldom enters,
but fquats down till the hounds have over-fhot her; and then die will return
the very way die came, for fear of the wet and dew that hang on the boughs.
—
When fhe comes near brook,-fides and plafhes, die will make all her erodings,
doublings, and workings. Some hares have been fo crafty, that, as foon as they
have heard the found of a horn, they would inftantly ftart out of their form,
though it was at the diftance of a quarter of a mile, and go and fwim in fome
pool, and reft upon fome rudi-bed in the midft of it; and would not ftir from
thence till they have heard the found of the horn again, and then have ftarted
out, fwimming to land, and have flood up before the hounds for hours before
they could kill them, fwimming and uftng all l’ubtilties and erodings in the
water* Nay, fuch is the natural craft and fubtilty of the hare, that fometimes
after fhe has been hunted three hours, die will drive up a frefli hare, and
fquat in the fame form herfelf. Others, having been hunted a conftderable
time, will creep under the door of a flieep-cot, and hide themfelves among the
flieep; or, when they have been hard hunted, will run in among a flock of flieep,
and will by no means be gotten out from among them till the hounds are coupled
up, and the flieep driven into their pens. Some of them will take the ground
like a rabbit, and run up a wall, and hide in the grafs on the top of it. Some hares
will go up one fide of the hedge and come down the other, the thicknefs of the
hedge being the only diftance between the courfes. A hare that has been forely
hunted, has got upon a quickfet hedge, and run a good way upon the top thereof,
and then leapt off upon the ground. And they will frequently betake themfelves
to furze-bufties, and will leap front one to the other, to cut off the fcent, w'hereby
the hounds are frequently at fault. —In the fpring-time or fummer, a hare will
not fit in buflies, becaufe they are frequently infefted w'ith pifmires, fnakes, and
adders; but will fit inborn-fields and open places. In the winter-time they fit
near towns and villages, in tufts of thorns and brambles, efpecially when the wind
is northerly or foutherly.—It is remarkable that the hare, although ever fo fre-
quently purfued by the dogs, feldom leaves the place w here flie was brought forth,
or even the form in which flie ufually fits. It is common to find them in the fame
place next day, after being long and keenly chafed the day before.. The females
2 are
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 115
are more grofs than the males, and have lefs ftrength and agility; they are likewife
more timid, and never allow the dogs to approach fo near their form before riling
as the males. They likewife pradtil’e more arts, and doable more frequently, than
the males. The hare is diffufed almoft over every climate ; and, notwithftanding
they are every-where hunted, their fpecies never diminiflies. They are in a con-
dition of propagating the firft year of their lives ;
the females go with young about
thirty days, and produce four or five at a time; and, as foon as they have brought
forth, they again admit the embraces of the male; fo that they may be faid to be
always pregnant. The eyes of the young are open at birth ;
the mother fuqkles
them about twenty days, after which they feparate from her, and procure their own
food. The young never go far from the place w-here they were brought forth; but
ftill they live folitary, and make forms about thirty paces diftant from each other:
thus, if a young hare be found any where, you may almoft be certain of finding
feveral others within a very fmall diftance.
The fecundity of the rabbit is ftill greater than that of the hare. They will breed
feven times in the year, and the female fometimes brings eight young ones at a
time. Suppofing this to happen regularly for four years, the number of rabbits
from a fingle pair will amount to one million two hundred feventy-four thoufand
eight hundred and forty.—They are in a condition for generating when fix months
old ;
and, like the hare, the female is almoft conftantly in feafori ; fhe goes with
young about thirty days, and brings forth from four to eight at a litter. A few
days before littering, fhe digs a hole in the earth, not in a ftraight line, but in a
zig-zag form: the bottom of this hole the enlarges every w-ay, and then pulls off
a great quantity of hair from her belly, of which fiie makes a kind of bed for
her young. During the two firft days after birth, fiie never leaves them but when
prefled with hunger, and then fiie eats quickly and returns ;
and in this man-
ner fiie fuckles and attends her young for fix weeks. All this time both the
hole and the young are concealed from the male: fometimes, when the female goes
out, the, in order to deceive the male, fills up the mouth of the hole with earth,
mixed with her own urine. But w hen the young ones begin to come to the mouth
of the hole, and to eat fuch herbs as the mother brings to them, the father feems
to know them ;
he takes them betwixt his paws, fmooths their hair, and careffes
them w'ith great fondnefs..
The fox is efteemed to be the raoft fagacious and moft crafty of all beafts of
prey. The former quality he fliow's in his method of providing himfelf with an
afylum, where he retires from prefling dangers, where he dwells, and where he
brings up his young: and his craftinefs is chiefly difcovered by the lchemes he
falls upon in order to catch lambs, geefe, hens, and all kinds of fmall birds. The
fox
J 16 A KEY TO PHYSIC
fox fixes his abode on the border of a wood, in the neighbourhood of cottages :
he liflens to the crowing of the cock, and the cries of the poultry. He fcents them
at a diflance,- he choofes his time with judgment; he conceals his road as well as
his defign; he flips forward with caution, fometimes even trailing his body; and fel-
dom makes a fruitlefs expedition. In this manner he has been feen, on a moon-light
night, toenter a paflure where feveral hares were feeding, when lying down, and taking
his tail in his mouth, he has trailed along like a rolling-flone, unfufpedled by his prey,
till he had got too near for them all to efcape. If he Can leap the wall, or get in
underneath, he ravages the court-yard, puts all to death, and then retires foftly with
his prey, which he either hides under the herbage, or carries off to his kennel. He
returns in a few' minutes for another, which he carries off, or conceals in the fame
manner, but in a different place. In this way he proceeds till the progrefs of the
fun, or fome movements perceived in the houfe, advertife him that it is time to
fufpend his operations, and to retire to his den. He plays the fame game with the
catchers of thrufhes, woodcocks, &c. He vifits the nets and birdlime very early
in the morning, carries off fucceffively the birds which are entangled, and lays them
in different places, efpecially near the fides of highways, in the furrows, under the
herbage or brufliwood, where they fometimes lie two or three days ;
but he knows
perfedlly where to find them when he is in need. He hunts the young hares in
the plains, feizes old ones in their feats, never miffes thofe which are wounded,
digs out the rabbits in the warrens, difcovers the nells of partridges and quails,
feizes the mothers on the eggs, and deflroys a vafl quantity of game. The fox is
exceedingly voracious; befides flefh of all kinds, he eats, with equal avidity, eggs,
milk, cheefe, fruits, and particularly grapes. When the young hares and partridges
fail him, he makes war againft rats, field-mice, ferpents, lizards, toads, &c. Ofthefe
he deflroys vafl numbers; and this is the only fervice he does to mankind. He is fo
fond of honey, that he attacks the wild bees, wafps, and hornets. Theyatfirfl put him
to flight by a thoufand flings ;
but he retires only for the purpofe of rolling himfelf on
the ground to crufli them ;
and he returns fo often to the charge, that he obliges them
to abandon the hive, which he foon uncovers, and devours both the honey and wax.
He will alfo devour fiflies, lobflers, grafs-hoppers, &c. Foxes produce but once
a-year; and the litter commonly confifls of four or five, feldom fix, and never lefs than
three. When the female is full, flie retires, and feldom goes out of her hole, where fhe
prepares a bed for her young. When fhe perceives that her retreat is difcovered, and
that her young have been diflurbed, the carries them ofl’one by one, and goes infearch
of another habitation. The fox, as well as the congenerous wolf, will produce with
the dog kind, as noticed before. The fox fleeps found, and may be eafily approached
without awakening: he fleeps in a round form, like the dog; but, when he only
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 117
repofes himfelf, he extends his hind legs, and lies on his belly. It is in this fitua-
tion that he fpies the birds along the hedges, and meditates fchemes for catching
them. The fox flies when he hears the explofion of a gun, or fmells gunpowder.
Being exceedingly fond of grapes, he does much mifchief in vineyards.—When
purfued by the hounds, he feldom fails to deceive and fatigue them, becaufe he
purpofely palfes through the thickeft parts of the foreft or places of the moft diffi-
cult accefs, where the dogs are hardly able to follow him; and, when he takes to
the plains, he runs ftraight out, without (topping or doubling.—He is a great ad-
mirer of his own tail, with which he frequently amufes and exercifes himfelf, by run-
ning in circles to catch it : and, in cold weather, wraps it round his nofe. The
fmell of this animal is in general very ftrong, but that of the urine is remarkably
fetid. This feems fo offenfive even to itfelf, that it will take the trouble of dig-
ging a hole in the ground, Itretching its body at full length over it ; and there,
after depofiting its water, covers it over with the earth, as the cat does its dung.
The fmell is fo obnoxious, that it has often proved the means of the fox’s efcape
from the dogs; who have fo ftrong an averfion at the filthy effluvia, as to avoid
encountering the animal it came from. It is faid the fox makes ufe of its urine as
an expedient to force the cleanly badger from its habitation : whether that be the
means, is rather doubtful ;
but that the fox makes ufe of the badger’s hole is cer-
tain; not through want of ability to form its own retreat, but to fave itfelf fome
trouble; for, after the expulfion of the firft inhabitant, the fox improves as well as
enlarges it confiderably, adding feveral chambers, and providently making feveral
entrances to fecure a retreat from every quarter. In warm weather, it will quit its
habitation for the fake of balking in the fun, or to enjoy the free air; but then it
rarely lies expofed, but choofes fome thick brake, that it may reft fecure from fiir-
prife. Crows, magpies, and other birds, who confider the fox as their common
enemy, will often, by their notes of anger, point out his retreat.
The ftag or buck is the moft crafty of all the fpecies of deer. He conceals him-
felf with great addrefs, is moft difficult to trace, and derives fuperior refources from
inftinft; for, though he has the misfortune to leave behind him a ftrong fcent,
which redoubles the ardour and appetite of the hounds, he knows how to withdraw
himfelf from their purfuit, by the rapidity with which he begins his flight, and by
his numerous doublings. He delays not his arts of defence till his ftrength fails
him; but, as loon as he finds that the firft efforts of a rapid chace have been un-
fuccefsful, he repeatedly retraces his former fteps ;
and after confounding, by
thefe oppofite movements, the dire6tion he has taken, after intermixing the pre-
fent with the paft fcent from his body, he rifes from the earth by a great bound,
and, retiring to a fide, he lies down flat on his belly, and in this immoveable

lituation he allows the whole troop of his deceived enemies to pafs very near him.
His laft refuge, when forely hunted, is the foil, keeping the middle, fearing,
left, by touching a bough, or a fhrub, he may give greater fcent to the hounds.
He always fwims againft the ftre^m, and will often cover himfelf under water, fo
as to Ihow nothing but his nofe. Where opportunity of water fails, he will fly
into herds of cattle, as cows, fheep, &c. and will fometimes leap on an ox, cow,
or the like, that he may leave no fcent on the ground. What is ftill more re-
markable, it is related by the principal huntfman of Louis XII. that a buck which
they had hunted for a long time, being at laft hard preffed, leaped into the
middle of a very large white-thorn, in order to cut off its fcent; and there flood
aloft till he was run through by the huntfman, rather than ftir from the place to
be worried by the dogs.—Their feafon of love commences about the end of Auguft
or beginning of September, when they leave the coppice, return to the forefts, and
fearch for the hinds. They cry with a loud voice ; their neck and throat fwell
;
they become extremely reftlefs, and traverfe in open day the fields and the fallow
grounds: they ftrike their horns againft the trees and hedges ; in a word, they feena
to be tranfported with fury, and run from country to country, till they find the hinds
or females, whom they purfue and compel into compliance ; for the female at firft
avoids and flies from the male, and never fubmits to his embraces till flie is fatigued
with the purfuit. The old hinds likewife come in feafon before the younger ones.
When two bucks approach the fame hind, they mull fight before they enjoy. If
nearly equal in ftrength, they threaten, paw the ground, fet up terrible cries, and
attack each other with fuch fury, that they often infli6t mortal wounds with the
ftrokes of their horns. The combat never terminates but in the defeat or flight of
one of the rivals. The conqueror lofes not a moment in enjoying his victory, unlefs
another rival approaches, whom he is again obliged to attack and repel. The oldeft
flags are always mailers of the field . becaufe they are ftronger and more furious
than the young ones, who muft wait patiently till their fuperiors tire, and quit their
miftreffes. Sometimes, however, the young flags accomplifh their purpofe while
the old ones are fighting, and, after a hafty gratification, fly off. The hinds prefer
the old flags, not becaufe they are moft courageous, but becaufe they are much,
more ardent. It has been alleged, that, attracted by the fcent of the hinds, the
flags in the rutting-feafon throw themfelves into the fea, and pafs from one ifland
to another at the diftance of feveral leagues. They leap ftill more nimbly than they
fwim ; for, when purfued, they eafily clear a hedge or fence of fix or feven feet
high ;
and on all prefiing occafions fhow aftonifhing fenfe and fagacity.
The fenfes of the wolf are likewife excellent, particularly his fenfe of fmelling, which
often extends farther than his eye. The odour of carrion ftrikes him at the diftance

of more than a league. He likewife {cents live animals very far, and hunts them
a long time by following their track. When he ilfues from the wood, he never lofes
the wind. He flops on the borders of the foreft, fmells on all Tides, and receives
the corpufcles of living or dead animals brought to him from a diftance by the
wind, Though he prefers living to dead animals, yet he devours the moft putrid
carcafes. He is fond of human flefh ;
and, if ftronger, he would perhaps eat no
other. Wolves have been known to follow armies, and to come in troops to the
field of battle, where bodies are carelefsly interred, to tear them up, and to devour
them with an infatiable avidity ;
and, when once accuftomed to human flelh, they
ever after attack men, prefer the fhepherd to the flock, devour women, and carry
off children. The wolf, unlike the dog, is an enemy to all fociety, and keeps no
company even with thofe of his own fpecies. When feveral wolves unite together,
it is not a fociety of peace, but of war ;
it is attended with tumult and dreadful
howlings, and indicates an attack upon fome large animal, as a flag, an ox, or a
formidable maftiff. This military expedition is no fooner finilhed, than they fepa-
rate, and each returns in filence to his folitude. There is even little intercourfe be-
tween the males and females : they feel the mutual attractions of love but once a-
year, and never remain long together. The females come in feafon in winter: many
males follow the fame female; and this affociation is more bloody than the former;
for they growl, chace, fight, and tear one another, and often facrifice him that is
preferred by the female. The female commonly flies a long time, fatigues her ad-
mirers, and retires, while they deep, with the moft alert or favourite male. The
wolves copulate like dogs, and have an offeous penis, furrounded with a ring, which
fwells and hinders them from feparating. When the females are about to bring
forth, they fearch for a concealed place in the inmoft receffes of the foreft. The
puppies come into the world blind, like dogs ;
the mother fuckles them fome weeks,
and foon teaches them to eat flefh, which the prepares for them by tearing it into
ftnall pieces. Some time after fhe brings them field-mice, young hares, partridges,
and live fowls. The young wolves begin by playing with thefe animals, and at laft
worry them ;
then the mother pulls off the feathers, tears them in -pieces, and gives
a part to each of her young. They never leave their den till the end of fix weeks
or two months. They then follow their mother, who leads them to drink in the
hollow trunk of a tree, or in fome neighbouring pool. She conduCts them back
to the den, or, when any danger is apprehended, obliges them to conceal them-
felves elfewhere. Though, like other females, the ftie-wolf is naturally more timid
than the male, yet, when her young are attacked, fhe defends them with intre-
pidity ;
fhe lofes all fenfe of danger, and becomes perfectly furious. She never
leaves them till they are fo ftrong as to need no alfiftance or protection, and till
they
no A KEY TO PHYSIC
they have acquired talents fit for rapine. The wolf has great ftrength, efpecially in
the anterior parts of the body, in the mufcles of the neck, and jaws. He carries a
fiieep in his mouth, and at the fame time outruns the fhepherds ;
fo that he can
only be flopped or deprived of his prey by dogs. His bite is cruel, and always
more obftinate in proportion to the fmallnefs of the refiftance ; for, when an animal
can defend itfelf, he is cautious and circumfpeft. He never fights but from necef-
fity, and not from motives of courage. When wounded with a ball, he cries ;
and
yet, when difpatching him with bludgeons, he complains not. When he falls into
a fnare, he is fo overcome with terror, that he may be either killed or taken alive
without refiftance ;
he allows himfelf to be chained, muzzled, and led where you
pleafe, without exhibiting the leaft fymptom of refentment or difcontent. Wolves
are now fo rare in the populated part of America, that the inhabitants leave their
fheep the whole night unguarded ;
yet the government of Pennfylvania and New
Jerfey did fome years ago allow a reward of twenty fhillings, and the laft even
thirty fhillings, for the killing of a wolf. Tradition informed them what a fcourge
thofe animals had been to the colonies ;
fo they wifely determined to prevent the
like evil. In their infant ftate, wolves came down in multitudes from the moun-
tains, often attra6led by the fmell of the corpfes of hundreds of Indians who died
of the fmall-pox, brought among them by the Europeans : but the animals did not
confine their infults to the dead, but even devoured in their huts the fick and dying
favages.—Britain, a few centuries ago, was much infefted by them. They were, as
appears by Hollingfhead, very noxious to the flocks in Scotland in 1577; nor were
they entirely extirpated till about 1680, when the laft wolf fell by the hands of the
famous Sir Owen Cameron. Edward I. iffued out his royal mandate to Peter Corbet
to fuperintend and aflift in the deftru6tion of them in the feveral counties of Glou-
cefter, Worcefter, Hereford, Salop, and Stafford; and in the adjacent county of
Derby, certain perfons atWormhill held their lands by the duty of hunting and
taking the wolves that infefted the country, whence they were ftiled wolve-himt. To
look back into the Saxon times, w'e find that in Athelftan’s reign wolves abounded
fo in Yorkfhire, that a retreat was built at Elixton in that county, “ to defend
paffengers from the wolves, that they fliould not be devoured by them ;” and fuch
ravages did thefe animals make during winter, particularly in January, when the
cold was fevereft, that the Saxons diftinguifhed that month by the name of the
wolf-month. —At the Cape of Good Hope, there is a fpecies called the tiger-vrolf,
which is poffeffed of the peculiar gift of being enabled, in fome meafure, to
imitate the cries of other animals ; by which means this arch-deceiver is fome-
times enabled to beguile and attra£l calves, foals, lambs, and other animals.
Near fome of the larger farms, where there is a great deal of cattle, this ravenous
7
beaft
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 121
bead is to be found almoft every night; and at the fame time frequently from one
hour to another betraying itfelf by its howlings, gives the dogs the alarm. In this
eafe the cunning of the wolves is fo great, that a party of them, half flying and half
defending themfelves, will decoy the whole pack of dogs to follow them to the dis-
tance of a gun-fhot or more from the farm, with a view to give an opportunity to the
reft of the wolves to come out from their ambufcade, and, without meeting with
the leaft refiftance, carry off booty fuflicient for themfelves and theif fugitive bre-
thren. The tiger-wolf, though a much larger and ftronger animal, does not ven-
ture, without being driven to the utmoft necefiity, to meafure its ftrength with the
common dog, which is certainly an evident proof of its cowardice. Notwithftand-
ing this, the Hottentots inform us, that it is ftill within the memory of man, that
the tiger-wolf was bold enough to fteal upon them and moleft them in their huts,
particularly by carrying off their children. This, however, is now no longer the
cafe; a circumftance, perhaps, proceeding from the introduction of fire-arms into
the country, an invention which, in thefe latter times, has caufed this as well as
other wild beafts to ftand in greater awe of man than formerly. I have
heard the following ftory of the tiger-wolf mentioned, which is laughable enough,
though perhaps not quite fo probable :
“ At a feaft near the Cape one night, a trum-
peter who had got his fill was carried out of doors, in order that he might cool him-
felf, and get fober again. The fcent of him foon drew thither a tiger-wolf, which
threw him on his back, and dragged him along as a corpfe, up towards Table-moun-
tain. During this, however, the drunken mufician waked, enough in his fenfes to
know the danger of his fituation, and to found the alarm with his trumpet, which
he carried fattened to his fide. The wild beaft, as may eafily be fuppofed, was
not lefs frightened in his turn.” Any other betides a trumpeter would in fuch cir-
cumftances have been undoubtedly no better than wolf’s meat.
The jackal appears to have the gift of fcent equal to a dog, of which it feems to
be a wild fpecies. They go in packs of forty, fifty, and even two hundred ;
and hunt
like hounds in full cry from evening to morning. They deftroy flocks and poultry,
but in a lefs degree than the wolf or fox: ravage the ftreets of villages and gardens
near towns, and will even deftroy children, if left unprotected. They will enter
ftables and outhoufes, and devour {kins, or any thing made of leather. They
will familiarly enter a tent, and fteal whatfoever they find from the fleeping traveller.
In default of living prey, they will feed on roots and fruits ;
and even on the moft
infeCted carrion: they wiil greedily difinter the dead, and devour putrid carcafes.
They attend caravans, and follow armies, in hopes that death will provide them a
banquet. Their voice naturally is a howl. Barking, Mr. Pennant obferves, is la-
tently inherent, and in their ftateof nature feldom exerted ;
but its different modi-
No. 8. I i fications
A KEY TO PHYSIC
122
fications are adventitious, and expreffive of the new paflions and affe&ions gained
by a domeftic ftate. Their howlings and clamours in the night are dreadful, and
fo loud that people can fcarcely hear one another fpeak. Dellon fays, their voice is
like the cries of a great many children of different ages mixed together: when one
begins to howl, the whole pack join in the cry. This animal is vulgarly called the
lions provider, from an opinion that it roufes the prey for that quadruped. The
fa6t is, every creature in the foreft is fet in motion by the fearful cries of the jackals
;
the lion, and other beafts of rapine, by a fort of inftin6t, attend to the chace, and
lie in wait, to feize fuch timid animals as betake themfelves to flight at the noife of
this nightly pack.
From what has been ftated, as well as from the contemplation of nature in general,
it will appear, that there is an occult inftin6tive principle infufed into the whole race
of animal beings, whereby they are unerringly led on to the propagation and pre-
servation of their fpecies ;
yet fo as that no one ftiall become too numerous for the
exiftence of another, upon which they prey, or with which they live in a conti-
nual ftate of warfare. We may likewife remark, that the more fimilarity we dif-
cover among brutes, the more amicable we find them towards each other, becaufe
the corpufcles of their bodies have an agreement pleafing to their fenfitive faculty,
without exciting the appetite—but for which the fame fpecies would inceffantly
devour each other, and the purpofes of creation w'ould be annihilated by the opera-
tion of its own works. Contrary however to fuch a violation of order, we find
the beafts of the foreft, and brute animals in general, prey by antipathy upon thofe
which are oppofite or inimical in fcent and fpecies to themfelves ;
and affociate by
fympathy with thofe of fimilar and concordant qualities ;
but the moft powerful
effe6t of fympathy is to be found between the male and female of one and the fame
clafs of beings ; as we fhall demonftrate more fatisfa&orily and pleafingly, in our
confiderations
On MAN.
MAN is placed at the head of the animal creation ;
and is a being who feels,
refle6ts, thinks, contrives, and a6ts ;
who has power of changing his place upon
the earth at pleafure ;
who poffeffes the faculty of communicating his thoughts by
means of fpeech ;
and who has dominion over all other creatures on the face of the
globe. Animated and enlightened by a ray from the Divinity, he furpaffes in
dignity every material being. He fpends lefs of his time in folitude than in fociety,
or in obedience to thofe laws which he himfelf has framed.
The hiftory of man is an object of attention highly interefting, whether we con-
sider him in the different periods of his life, or take a view of the varieties of his

fpecies, of examine the wonderful fymmetry and conftruCtion of his parts in the
womb, or the more mature completion and organization of his body in perfeCt
manhood.—I fliall therefore attempt firlt to give a fhort fketch of him in thefe dif-
ferent points of view ;
and then, by confidering the aCtions and paffions of his
mind, the infirmities of his nature, the affeCtions of his heart, the objeCts of his
purfuits, and the impreffion of the celeftial, elementary, and atmofpherical influx;
of light, heat, colour, motion, magnetifm, electricity, and the univerfal fpirit of
nature which aCts upon his Conftitution ; deduce thofe obvious and inevitable
caufes that refult from them, and which it fhould be the care of every man to
know, who would with to difcover the golden Key to the occult operations of
Nature, and to the fecret of preferving health and long life.
Nofce teipfum,
“ Know thyfelf,” is a precept worthy of the lawgiver of Athens ;
it has been called the firft Itep to wifdom, and was formerly written in letters of
gold over the portal of the Temple of Diana. In purfuit of this important infor-
mation, Man may be contemplated in the following refpe&S:
Physiologically,—as a frail machine, chiefly compofed of nerves and fibres
interwoven with each other. His molt perfeCt (late is during youth ;
and he is
endowed with faculties more numerous, and in higher perfection, than thofe of all
other animals. “ Man, intended for exercifing dominion over the whole animal
creation, is fent by Nature into the world naked, forlorn, and bewailing his lot;
he is then unable to ufe his hands or feet, and is incapable of acquiring any kind of
knowledge without inftruCtion ;
he can neither fpeak, nor walk, nor eat, nor per-
form any aCtion whatever by natural inftinCt Pliny.
—“ We may judge what kind
of life is allotted to us by Nature, fince it is ordained, as an omen, that we fhould
come weeping into the world Seneca.
—“ It is humiliating to the pride of man, to
confider the pitiable origin of this moll arrogant of all the animals Pliny.
Dietetically.—Cura valetuclinem. Bodily health and tranquillity of mind are
more to be defired than all the riches, pomp, or glory, of a Crcefus, a Solomon,
or an Alexander. Health is to be preferved by moderation ;
it is deftroyed by
abftinence, injured by a variety of delicacies, weakened by unufual things, and
ftrengthened by the ufe of proper and accuflomed fare. Man, learned in the per-
nicious art of cookery, is fond of many difhes, rendered palatable by the injurious
eflfeCts of fire, and by the baneful addition of wine. “ Hunger is fatisfied with a
fmall quantity of food, while luxury demands over-abundance. Imagination requires
vaft fupplies ;
while nature is contented with a moderate quantity of ordinary
food, and is burthened by fuperfluity Seneca. —According as thou lived, fo
lhall thy life be enjoyed.
Patho-
124 A KEY TO PHYSIC
Pathologically.—Memento rnori
!
The life of man refembles a bubble ready
to burft ;
bis fate is fufpended by a hair, and is dependent on the uncertain lapfe
of time. “The earth contains nothing more trail than man Homer.—“ Nothing
is weaker than human life : to what dangers, and to how many difeafes, is it not
expofed ! Hence the whole period of a man’s life is but a fpan : half of it is ne-
celfarily fpent in a (late refembling death ;
without including the years of infancy,
wherein there is no judgment ;
or the period of old age, fertile in fufferings, during
which the fenfes are blunted, the limbs become ftiff, and the faculties of fight and
hearing, the powers of walking, and the teeth, the inftruments of nourifhment,
fail before the reft of the body Pliny.—“ Thus a confiderable part of death is
fuffered during life ;
and death poflefles all that belonged to the times which are
paft. Finally, nature will fpeedily recal and deftroy all the beings which thou feeft,
and all that thy imagination can fuppofe to exift hereafter ; for death calls equally
upon all, whether they be good or whether they be evil Seneca.
Naturally.—Innocui vivite, Numen adejl
!
Man, the prince of animated be-
ings, who is a miracle of nature, and for whom all things on this earth were created,
is a mimic animal, weeping, laughing, finging, fpeaking ;
tractable, judicious, in-
quifitive, and moft wife; he is weak and naked, unprovided with natural weapons,
expofed to all the injuries of fortune, needful of affiftance from others, of an anx-
ious mind, folicitous of protection, continually complaining, changeable in temper,
obftinate in hope, and flow in the acquifition of wifdom. He defpifes the time
which is paft, abufes that which is prefent, and fets his affections on the uncertain
future ;
thus continually neglecting winged time, which, though infinitely precious,
can never be recalled : for thus the beft and readieft time, in every age, flies on
with miferable mortals ; fome it fummons to attend their daily and burthenfome
labours ;
fome it confines to luxurious inaction, pampered even to fuffocation with
fuperfluities ;
fome it folicits in the ever-reftlefs paths of ambition ;
fome it ren-
ders anxious for the acquifition of wealth, and diftrefles by the pofleflion of the
thing defired ; fome it condemns to folitude, and others to have their doors con-
tinually crouded with vifitors ;
here one bewails the conduct of his children, there
one grieves their lofs. Tears will fooner fail us than their caufes, which only obli-
vion can remove. “ On every hand our evils overbalance our advantages ;
w'e
are furrounded with dangers; we rufh forward into untried fituations; we are
enraged without having received provocation ;
like wild beafts, we deftroy thofe
we do not hate ;
we with for favourable gales, which lead us only to deftruction ;
the earth yawns wide, ready for our death Seneca.—“ Other animals unite to-
gether againft enemies of a kind different from their own, while man fuffers moft
injuries from his own fpecies:” Pliny.
POLI-
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 125
Politically.—E/to antiqua virtute et fule ! Man, inftead of following that
which is rights is fubje6led to the guidance of manifeft error; this envelopes all
his faculties under the thick veil of cuftom, as foon as he is born; according to its
didlates he is fed, educated, brought up, and direfted in all things; and by its
arbitrary rules-his honefty, fortitude, wifdom, morality, and religion, are judged of;
thus, governed by opinion, he lives conformably to cuftom, inftead of being
guided by reafon. Though fent into the world a perilhable being, (for all are evi-
dently born to fuffer,) inftead of endeavouring to fecure thofe things which are raoft
advantageous and truly beneficial, he, infatuated by the fmiles of fortune, anxioufly
eolle&s her gaudy trifles for future enjoyment, and negle6!s her real benefits; he
is driven to madnefs by envious fnarlers; he prwfecutes with hatred the truly reli-
gious for differing from himfelf in fpeculative opinions ;
he excites numberlefs
broils, not that he may do good, but for a purpofe that even himfelf is ignorant of.
He waftes his precious and irrecoverable time in trifles; he thinks lightly of im-
mortal and eternal concerns, while regulating the fucceffion of his pofterity; and
perpetually entering on new projects, forgetful of his real condition, he builds pa-
laces inftead of preparing his grave; till at length, in the midft of his fchemes,
death feizes him; and then, firft opening his eyes, he perceives, O man! that all is
delufion.
u Thus we live as if immortal, and firft learn in death that we have to
die:” Seneca*
Morally.—Benefac et Icetarel Man is compofed of an animated medullary
fubftance, which prompts him to that which is right; and of a bodily frame liable to
impreffions which inftigate him to the enjoyment of pleafure. In his natural ftate
he is foolilh, wanton, an inconfiderate follower of example, ambitious, profufe,
diffatisfied, cunning, peevilh, invidious, malicious, and covetous; by the influence
of juft morals he is transformed to be attentive, chafte, confiderate, modeft,
temperate, quiet; fincere, mild, beneficent, grateful, and contented. “ Sorrow,
luxury, ambition, avarice, the defire of life, and anxiety for the future, are common
to all animals Pliny;
Theologically.—Memento Creatoris tui
!
Man, the ultimate purpofe of crea-
tion, and mafterpiece of the works of Omnipotence, was placed on earth that he
might contemplate its perfe6tions; he was endowed with lapient reafon, and made
capable of forming conclufions from the impreffions of his fenfes, that, from a con-
fideration of created objects he might know' their Creator as the Almighty, the In-
finite, the Omnifcient,. the Eternal, God: that w'e may live morally under his
governing care, it is requifite that, we have a thorough convidtion of his exiftence,
and muft have it ever in remembrance. “ There are two things which lead to a
knowledge of God ;
creation and revelation Auguftine.—“ God, therefore, may

In the Syftema Naturae, Man ( Homo) is ranked as a diftin-61 genus of the order
Primates or “ Chiefs,” belonging to the Mammalia clafs of animals, or thofe which
nourifh their young by means of ladliferous teats or paps. Of this genus he is the
only fpecies: and denominated Sapiens
,
as being endowed with wifdom far fuperior
to, or rather in exclufionof, all other animals.
—
He varies, from climate, education,
and habits; and the following varieties, exclufive of wild men, are enumerated by
Linnaeus.
Americans. “ Ofcopper-coloured complexion, choleric conftitution, and remark-
ably eredl.”—Their hair is black, lank, and coarfe; their noftrils are wide; their
features harfh, and the chin is fcantily fupplied with beard. Are obftinate ki their
tempers, free and fatisfied with their condition; and are regulated in all their pro-
ceedings by traditional cufloms. —Paint their fkin with red ftreaks.
Europeans “ Of fair complexion, fanguine temperament, and brawny form."
The hair is flowing, and of various fhades of brown ; the eyes are moftly blue.
—
They are of gentle manners, acute in judgment, of quick invention, and governed
by fixed laws.—Drefs in clofe veflments.
Ajiaiics. “Of footy complexion, melancholic temperament, and rigid fibre.”
—
The hair is ftrong, black, and lank; the eyes are dark brow n. They are of grave,
haughty, and covetous, manners; and are governed by opinions.—Drefs in loofie
garments.
Africans. “ Of black complexion, phlegmatic temperament, and relaxed fibre.”
The hair is black and frizzly ; the fkin foft and filky; the nofe flat : the lips are
thick ;
and the female has a natural apron, and long lax breafis. —They are of
crafty, indolent, and carelefs, difpofitions, and governed in their a&ions by caprice.
—Anoint the fkin with greafe.
The following arrangement of the varieties in the human fpecies is offered by Dt.
Gmelin as more convenient than that of Linnaeus :
a, White, (Horn, albus.) Formed by the rules of fymmetrical elegance and
beauty; or atleaft what wr
e confider as fueh. —This divifion includes almofl all the
inhabitants of Europe; thofe of Afia on this fide of the Oby, the Cafpian, Mount
Imaus, and the Ganges; likewife the natives of the north of Africa, of Greenland,
and the Efquimaux.
b, Brown:

b, Brown : (Horn, badius.) Of a yellowilh brown colour ;
has fcanty hair, flat
features, and fmall eyes.—This variety takes in the whole inhabitants of Afia not
included in the preceding divifion.
c, Black : ( Horn. niger.J Of black complexion ;
frizzly hair, flat nofe, and thick
lips. —The whole inhabitants of Africa, excepting thofe of its more northern parts.
d, Copper-coloured : (Horn, cupreus.) The complexion of the {kin refembles
the colour of copper not burnilhed.—The whole inhabitants of America, except
the Greenlanders and Efquimaux.
e, Tawny: (Horn, fufcus.) Chiefly of a dark blackilh-brown colour ;
having a
broad nofe, and harfli coarfe ftraight hair The inhabitants of the louthern iflands,
and of moil of the Indian iflands.
Monjlets. Of thefe there are feveral varieties ;
the firft and fecond of which, in
the following lift, are occafioned by peculiarity of climate, while the reft are pro-
duced by artificial management. 1. Alpini: The inhabitants of the northern moun-
tains : they are fmall in ftature, aCtive, and timid in their difpofitions. 2. Patagonici:
The Patagonians of South America ;
of vaft fize, and indolent in their manners.
3. Monorchides
:
The Hottentots ;
having one tefticle extirpated. 4. Imberbes
:
Moft
of the American nations ; who eradicate their beards and the hair from every part
of the body except the fcalp. 5. JWacrocephali
:
The Chinefe; who have their heads
artificially forced into a conical form. 6. Plagiocephali
:
The Canadian Indians,
who have the fore part of their heads flattened, when young, by compreflion.
We have like wife the following account of monfters : Homines feri; defcribed
as walking on all- fours, as being dumb, and as covered with hair.—1. A youth found

Thofe characters in the form of man by which he is diftinguilhed from brute
animals, are reducible to two heads. The firft is the ftrength of the mufcles of the

confifts in the articulation of the head with the neck by the middle of its bale. We

we are fupported in thefe feveral pofitions. This power refides chiefly in the
mufcles which conftitute the principal part of the calf of the leg. Their exertion is
felt, and their motion is vifible externally, when we ftand upright and bend
our body backwards and forwards. This power is no lefs great when we walk even
on an horizontal plane. Inafcending a height, the weight of the body is more fen-
fibly felt than in defcending. All thefe motions are natural to man. Other animals,
on the contrary, when placed on their hind legs, are either incapable of performing
them at all, or do it partially, with great difficulty, and fora very fhort time. The
gibbon,
and thejocko or ourong-outcing, are the animals moft refembling man in their
conftruffion : they can ftand upright with much lefs difficulty than other brutes; but
the reftraint they are under in this attitude plainly fliows that it is not natural
to them. The reafon is, that the mufcles in the back part of the leg in the gibbon
and the jocko are not, as in man, fufficiently large to form a calf, and confequently
not fufficiently ftrong to fupport the thighs and body in a vertical line, and to pre-
ferve them in that pofture.—The attitudes proper to man, and to the animals,
are pointed out by the different manners in which the head is articulated with the
neck. The two points, by which the ofleous part of the head is conne&ed with the
firft vertebra of the neck, and on which every movement of the head is made with
the greatefl facility, are placed at the edge of the great foramen of the occipital
bone, which in man is fituated near the centre of the bafe of the cranium, affords a
pafiage for the medullary fubftance into the vertebrae, and determines the place of
the articulation of the head with the neck. The body and neck being, according to
the natural attitude, in a vertical dire&ion, the head muff; be placed in equilibrium
upon the vertebrae as upon a pivot or point of fupport. The face is on a vertical
line, almoft parallel to that of the body and neck. The jaws, which are very fliort
compared with thofe of moft other animals, extend very little farther forwards than
the forehead. —No animal has, like man, its hind legs as long as the body, neck, and
head, taken together, meafuring from the top of the head to the os pubis. —In the
frame of the human body the principal parts are nearly the fame with thofe
of other animals; but in the connexion and form of the bones, there is as great a.
difference as in the attitudes proper to each. Were a man to aflume the natural
pofture of quadrupeds, and try to walk by the heLp of his hands and feet, he would
find himfelf in a very unnatural fituation ;
he could not move his feet and head,
but with the greateft difficulty and pain; and, let him make what exertions he
pleafed, he would find it impoffiple to attain a fteady and continued pace. The
principal obftacles he would meet with would arife from the ftru6ture of the pelvis,
the hands, the feet, and the head.—The plane of the great occipital foramen, which
in man is almoft horizontal, puts the head in a kind of equilibrium upon
4 the

the neck when we dand ere6t in our natural attitude,- but, when we are in the
attitude of quadrupeds, it prevents us from raifing our head fo as to look forwards,
becaufe the movement of the head is (topped by the protuberance of the occiput,
which then approaches too near the vertebrae of the neck.—In molt animals, the
foramen magnum of the occipital bone is fituated at the back part of the head ;
the
jaws are very long; the occiput has no protuberance beyond the aperture, the
plane of which is in a vertical direction, or inclined a little forwards or backwards;
fo that the head is pendant, and joined to the neck by its poderior part. This po-
fition of the head enables quadrupeds, though, their bodies are in a horizontal di-
rection, to prefent their muzzle forwards, and to raife it fo as to reach above them,
or to touch the earth with the extremity of their jaws when they bring their neck
and head down to their feet. In the attitude of quadrupeds, man could touch the
earth only with the fore part or the top of the head. —When man is ftanding, his
heel reds upon the earth as well as the other parts of his foot; w’hen he walks, it is
the find part which touches the ground; man can (land on one foot: thefe are pe-
culiarities in (IruClure and in the manner of moving which are not to be found in
other animals. We may therefore conclude that man cannot be ranked in the clafs
of quadrupeds. We may add, that in man the brain is much larger, and the jaws
much (horter, than in any other animal. The brain, by its great extent, forms
the protuberance of the occipital bone, the forehead, and all that part of the head
w hich is above the ears. In animals, the brain is fo fmall, that mod of them have
no occiput, or the front is either wanting or little raifed. In animals which have
large foreheads, fuch as the horfe, the ox, the elephant, &c. they are placed as
low, and even lower, than the ears. Thefe animals likewife want the occiput,
and the top of the head is of very fmall extent. The jaws, which form the greated
portion of the muzzle, are large in proportion to the fmallnefs of the brain. The
length of the muzzle varies in different animals in folipede animals it is very
long; it is fhort in the ourang-outang; and in man it does not exid at all. No
beard grows on the muzzle.
Anatomids have employed much pains in the dudy of the material part of man,
and of that organization which determines his place in the animal creation. From
tracing and combining his different external parts ^ from obferving that his body is
in fome places covered with hair; that he can walk upon his hands and his feet at
the fame time, in the manner of quadrupeds; that, like certain animals which hold
their food in their paws, he has two clavicles; that the female brings forth her
young alive, and that her breads are fupplied with milk ;
from thefe circumdances
we might be led to adign man a place in the clafs of viviparous quadrupeds. But,
in truth, fuch an arrangement would be defective, arbitrary, and abfurd. Man is
» No. 9. L L not
130 A KEY TO PHYSIC i
not a quadruped : of all the animals, he alone can fupport himfelf continually,
and without reftraint, in an ere6t pofture; (that is, with his head and body in a
vertical line upon his legs.) In this inajeftic and dignified attitude, he can change
his place, furvey this earth which he inhabits, and turn his eyes towards the vault
of heaven. By a noble and eafy gait, he preferves an equilibrium in the feveral
parts of his body, and tranfports himfelf from one place to another with different
degrees of celerity. To man alone nature has denied a covering; but ftill he is her
mafterpiece, the laft work which came from the hands of the Almighty Artift, the
fovereign and the chief of animals, a world in miniature, the centre which conne6ts
the univerfe together. The form of his body, the organs w hereof are conftru&ed
in fuch a manner as to produce a much greater effe6l than thofe of other animals,
announces his power. Every thing demonftrates the excellence of his nature, and
the immenfe diftance placed by the bounty of the Creator between man and beaft.
Man is a reafonable being; brute animals are deprived of that noble faculty. The
weakeft and raoft ftupid of the human race is able to manage the moft fagacious
quadruped; he commands it, and makes it fubfervient to his ufe. The operations
of brutes are purely the effect of mechanical impulle, and continue always the fame;
human works are varied without end, and infinitely diverfified in the manner of
execution. The foul of man is free, independent, and immortal. He is fitted lor
the ftudy of fcience, and the cultivation of art; he has the exclufive privilege of
examining every thing which has exiftence, and of holding communication with
his fellow-creatures by language, by particular motions of the body, and by
marks and chara6ters mutually agreed upon. Hence arifes that phyfical pre-emi-
nence which he enjoys over all animals; and hence that power w’hich he poffeftes
over the elements, and (fo to fpeak) over nature itfelf. Man, therefore, is une-
qualled in his kind; but the individuals thereof differ greatly from one another in
figure, ftature, colour, manners, and difpofitions. The globe which man inha-
bits is covered with the produ6tions of his induftry and the works of his hands
:
it is his labour, in fhort, which gives a value to the w'hole terreftrial mafs.
Nothing (fays M. Buffon) exhibits fuch a ftriking pi6ture of our weaknefs as
the condition of an infant immediately after birth. Incapable of employing its
organs, it needs afiiftance of every kind. In the firft moments of our exiftence,
we prefent an image of pain and mifery, and are more weak and helplefs than the
young of any other animal. At birth, the infant pafles from one element to
another: when it leaves the gentle warmth of the tranquil fluid by which it was
completely furrounded in the womb of the mother, it becomes expofed to the im-
preffions of the air, and inftantly feels the effe&s of that a<5live element. The air
afting upon the olfactory nerves, and upon the organs of refpiration, produces a
4 fhock

lhock fomething like fneezing, by which the breaft is expanded, and air is ad-
mitted into the lungs. In the mean time, the agitation of the diaphragm prefies
upon the vifcera of the abdomen, and the excrements are thus for the firft time
difcharged from the inteftines, and the urine from the bladder. The air dilates
the veficles of the lungs, and, after being rarefied to a certain degree, is expelled
by the fpring of the dilated fibres re-adting upon this rarefied fluid. The infant
now refpires ;
and articulates founds, or cries. —Moft animals are blind for fome
days after birth : infants open their eyes to the light the moment they come into
the world ;
but they are dull, fixed, and commonly blue. The new-born child
cannot diftinguifli objedts, becaufe he is incapable of fixing his eyes upon them.
The organ of vifion is yet imperfedt ;
the cornea is u'rinkled ;
and perhaps the
retina is too foft for receiving the images of external objedts, and for communicating
the fenfation of diftindt vifion. At the end of forty days, the infant begins to hear
and to fmile. About the fame time it begins to look at bright objedts, and fre-
quently to turn its eyes towards the window, a candle, or any light. Now like-
wife it begins to weep ;
for its former cries and groans were not accompanied ufith
tears. Smiles and tears are the effedt of two internal fenfations, both of which de-
pend on the adtion of the mind. Thus they are peculiar to the human race, and
ferve to exprefs mental pain or pleafure ;
while the cries, motions, and other marks
of bodily pain and pleafure, are common to man and moft of the other animals.
Confidering the fubjedt as metaphyficians, we fhall find that pain and pleafure are
the univerfal power which fets all our paftions in motion.
The fize of an infant born at the full time is commonly twenty-one inches; and
that foetus, which nine months before was an imperceptible bubble, now weighs
ten or twelve pounds, and fometiines more. The head is large in proportion to
the body ;
and this difproportion, w hich is ftill greater in the firft ftage of the
foetus, continues during the period of infancy. The Ikin of a new-born Child is of
a xeddifh colour, becaufe it is fo fine and tranfparent as to allow a flight tint of the
colour of the blood to fliine through. The form of the body and members is by
no means perfedt in a child foon after birth ;
all the parts appear to be fwollen. At
the end of three days, a kind of jaundice generally comes on, and at the fame time
milk is to be found in the breafts of the infant, which may be fqueezed out by the
fingers. The fwelling decreafes as the child grows up.
The liquor contained in the amnios leaves a vifcid whitilh matter upon the body
of the child. In this country we have the precaution to wafli the new-born infant
only with warm water ;
but it is the cuftom with whole nations, inhabiting the
coldeft climates, to plunge their infants into cold water as foon as they are born,
without their receiving the leaft injury. It is even faid that the Laplanders leave
* their
132 A KEY TO PHYSIC
their children in the fnow till the cold has almoft flopped their refpiration, and then
plunge them into a warm bath. Among thefe people, the children are alfo wafhed
thrice a-day during the fil'd year of their life. The inhabitants of northern coun-
tries are perfuaded that the cold bath tends to make men dronger and more robud,
and on that account accudom their children to the ufe of it from their infancy.
The truth is, that we are totally ignorant of the power of habit, or how far it can
make our bodies capable of differing, of acquiring, or of lofing.
The child is not allowed to fuck as foon as it is born; but time is given for dis-
charging the liquor and dime from the domach, and the meconium or excrement,
which is of a black colour, from the intedines. As thefe fubdances mio-ht four the
milk, a little diluted wine mixed with fugar is firft given to the infant; and the
bread is not prefented to it before ten or twelve hours have elapfed.
The young of quadrupeds can of themfelves find the way to the teat of the mo-
ther: it is not fo with man; the mother, in order to fuckle her child, mud raife
it to her bread; and, at this feeble period of life, the infant can exprefs its wants
only by its cries.
New-born children have need of frequent nourifhment. During the day, the
bread ought to be given to them every two hours, and during the night as
often as they wake. At fird they deep almod continually ;
and they feem never
to wake but when preffed by hunger or pain. Sleep is ufeful and refrefhing to
them; and it fometimes becomes neceffary to employ narcotic dofes, proportioned
to the age and conftitution of the child, for the purpofe of procuring them repofe*
The common way of appeafing the cries of children is by rocking them in the
cradle; but this agitation fhould be very gentle, otherwife a great rifk is run of con-
fufing the infant’s brain, and of producing a total derangement. It is neceffary to
their being in good health, that their deep be long and natural. It is poffible, how-
ever, that they may deep too much, and thereby endanger their conditution. In
that cafe, it would be proper to take them out of the cradle, and awaken them by a
gentle motion, or by prefenting fome bright objedl to their eyes. At this age we
receive the fii d impredions from the fenfes, which, without doubt, are more im-
portant during the red of life than is generally imagined. Great care ought to be
taken to place the cradle in fuch a manner that the child lhall be directly oppofite
to the light : for the eyes are always diredted towards that part of the room where
the light is ftronged: and, if the cradle be placed fideways, one of them, by turn-
ing towards the light, will acquire greater drength than the other, and the child
will fquint. For the two fird months, no other food fhould be given to the child
but the milk of the nurfe; and, when it is of a weak and delicate confutation, this
nourifhment alone fhould be continued during the third or fourth month. A child,
however
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 133
however robuft and healthful, may be expofed to great danger and inconvenience,
if any other aliment is adminiftered before the end of the firft month. In Holland,
Italy, Turkey,- and the whole Levant, the food of children is limited to the milk of
the nurfe for a whole vear. The favages of Canada give their children fuck for
four, live, and fometimes even feven, years. In this country, as nurfes generally
have not a fufficient quantity of milk to fatisfy the appetite of their children, they
commonly fupply the want of it by panada, or other light preparations.
The teeth ufually begin to appear about the age of feven months. . The cutting
of thefe, although a natural operation, does not follow the common laws of nature,
which a6t continually on the human body without occafioning the fmalleft pain,
or even producing any fenfation. Here a violent and painful effort is made, accom-
panied with cries and tears. Children at firft lofe their fprightlinefs and gaiety;
they become fad, reftlefs, and fretful. The gums are red, and fwelled; but they
afterwards become white, when the preffure of the teeth is fo great as to flop the
circulation of the blood. Children apply their fingers to their mouth, that they may
remove the irritationWhich they feel there. Some relief is given, by putting into
their hands a bit of ivory or of coral, or of fome other hard and fmooth body,
with which they rub the gums at the aff36ted part. This preffure, being oppofed
to that of the teeth, calms the pain for a moment, contributes to make the mem-
brane of the gum thinner, and facilitates its rupture. Nature here a£ts in oppo-
fition to herfelf; and an incifion of the gum muff fometimes take place, to allow
a paffage to the tooth.
When children are allowed to cry too long and too often, ruptures are fometime&
occafioned by the efforts they make. Thefe may eafily be cured by the fpeedy ap-
plication of bandages; but, if this remedy has been too long delayed, the difeafe
may continue through life. Children are very much fubjeft to worms. Some of
the bad effects occafioned by thefe animals might be prevented by giving them a
little wine now and then,, for fermented liquors have a tendency to prevent their
generation.
Though the body is very delicate in the ftate of infancy, it is then lefs fenfible of
cold than at any other part of life. The internal heat appears to be greater : the
pulfe in children is much greater than in adults ;
from which we are certainly inti-
tled to infer, that the internal heat is greater in the fame proportion. For the fame
reafon, it is evident that final 1 animals have more heat than large ones; for
the beating of the heart and of the arteries is always quicker in proportion to the
fmallnefs of the animal. The ftrokes of the heart in a fparrow fucceed one another
fo rapidly, that they can fcarcely be counted.

Till three years of age, the life of a child is very precarious. In the two or three
following years, it becomes more certain; and at fix or feven years of age, a .child
has a better chance of living than at. any other period of life. From the bills of
mortality publilhed in London, it appears, that, of a certain number of children born
at the fame time, one half of them die the three firft years : according to
which, one half of the human race are cut off before they are three years of age.
But the mortality among children is not near fo great every-where as in London.
M. DuprC de Saint Maur, from a great number of obfervations made in France, has
fhown that half of the children born at the fame time are not extinCt till feven or
eight years have elapfed.
t
The period of infancy is followed by that of adolefcence. This begins, together
with puberty, at the age of twelve or fourteen, and commonly ends in girls at fix-
teen, and in boys at eighteen, but fometimes not till twenty-one, twenty-three,
or twenty-five, years of age. According to its etymology (being derived fiom
the Latin word cidolcfcentia,') it is completed when the body has attained its full
height. Thus, puberty accompanies adolefcence, and precedes youth. This is
the fpring of life; this is the feafon of pleafures, of loves, and of graces: but
alas ! this fmiling feafon is of Ihort duration. Hitherto nature feems to have had
nothing in view but the prefervation and increafe of her work : fhe has made no
provifion for the infant except what is neceffary to its life and growth. It has lived,
or rather enjoyed a kind of vegetable exiftence, which was fhut up within itfelf, and
which it was incapable of communicating. In this firft ftage of life, reafon
is ftill afleep: but the principles of life foon multiply; and man has not only what
is necelfary to his own exiftence, but what enables him to give exiftence to others.
This redundancy of life, this fource of health and vigour, can no longer be con-
fined, but endeavours to diffufe and expand itfelf.
The age of puberty is announced by feveral marks. The firft fymptom is a kind
of numbnefs and ftiffnefs in the groins, accompanied with a new and peculiar fenfa-
tion in thofe parts which diftinguilh the fexes. There, as well as in the arm pits,
fmall protuberances of a whitilh colour appear, which are the germs of a new pro-
duction, of a kind of hair by which thefe parts are afterwards to be veiled. The
voice, for a confiderable time, is rough and unequal; after which it becomes ful-
ler, ftroriger, and graver, than it was before. This change may eafily be diftin-
guilhed in boys ;
but lefs fo in girls, becaufe their voices are naturally lharper.
Thefe marks of puberty are common to both fexes: but there are marks peculiar
to each, fuch as the difcharge of the menfes and growth of the brealts, in girls;
the beard, and the emilfion of femen, in boys : in Ihort, the feeling of venereal
defire, and the appetite which unites the fexes. Among all races of mankind, the
females
t
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 135
females arrive at puberty fooner than the males ;
but the age of puberty is different
in different nations, and feems partly to depend on the temperature of the climate
and the quality of the food. In all the fouthern countries of Europe, and in cities,
the greateft part of girls arrive at puberty about twelve, and boys about fourteen,
years of age. But in the northern parts, and in the country, girls fcarcely arrive
at puberty till they are fourteen or fifteen, and boys not till they are fixteen or
feventeen. In our climate, girls, for the greateft part, have attained complete
maturity at eighteen, and boys at twenty, years of age.
At the age of adolefcence, and of puberty, the body commonly attains its full
height. About that time, young people flioot put feveral inches almoft at once.
But there is no part of the human body which increafes more quickly and more
perceptibly than the organs of generation in both fexes. In males, this growth is
nothing but an unfolding of the parts, an augmentation in fize ;
but in females, it
often occaftons a fhrinking and contradtion, which have received different names
from thofe who have treated of the figns of virginity.
Marriage is a ftate fuitable to man, wherein he muft make ufe of thofe new fa-
culties which he has acquired by puberty. At this period of life, the defire of pro-
ducing a being like himfelf is ftrongly felt. The external form and the correfpon-
dence of the organs of fex occafion without doubt that irrefiftible attradlion which
unites the fexes and perpetuates the race. By connedting pleafure with the pro-
pagation of the fpecies, nature has provided moft effedtually for the continuance
of her work. Increase and multiply is the exprefs command of the Creator, and
one of the natural fundtions of life. We may add, that at the age of puberty a
thoufand impreffions adt upon the nervous fyftem, and reduce man to fuch a fitua-
tion, that he feels his exiftence only in that voluptuous fenfe, which then appears to
become the feat of his foul, which engroffes the whole fenfibility of which he is
fufceptible, and which at length proceeds to fuch a height, that its attacks cannot
long be fupported w ithout a general derangement of the whole machine. The
continuance of fuch a feeling may fometimes indeed prove fatal to thofe w-ho in-
dulge in exceffive enjoyment; but it is equally dangerous to thofe who obftinately
perfift in celibacy, efpecially when ftrongly folicited by nature to the contrary.
The femen, being too long confined in the fhminal veffels, may, by its ftimulant
property, occafion difeafes in both fexes, and excite irritations fo violent as to
reduce man to a level with the brutes, which, when adted upon by fuch impref-
fions, are perfedtly furious and ungovernable. When this irritation proceeds to
extremity, it produces what is called the furor uterinus in women. The oppofite
habit, however, is infinitely more common, efpecially in the temperate, and above
all in the frozen, zones. After all, excefs is much more to be dreaded than conti-
J36 A KEY TO PHYSIC
nency. The number of diffolute and intemperate men afford us plenty of examples.
Some have loft their memory, fome have been deprived of fight, many have become
early bald, and fome have died, through mere weaknefs. In fuch a cafe, bleeding
is well known to be fatal. Young men cannot be too often warned of the irrepara-
ble injury they may do to their health ;
and parents, to whofe care they are en-
trufted, ought to employ all the means in their power to turn them from fuch dan-
gerous exceffes. But at the age of puberty, young men know not of how great
importance it is to prolong this finding feafon of their days, whereon the happinefs
or mifery of their future life fo much depends. Then they look not forward to fu-
turity, nor refledt on what is paft, nor enjoy prefent pleafures with moderation.
How many ceafe to be men, or at leaft to have the faculties of men, before the age
of thirty? Nature mull not be forced : like a true mother, her objedl is the fober
and difcreet union of the fexe3. It is fufficient to obey when flie commands, and
to anfwer when lhe calls. Neither muft we forget here to mention and condemn an
outrage committed againft nature, the fhameful pradtice of which endangers the
lofs of health, and the total ruin of the conftitution ;
I mean that folitary liberti-
nism, fo extenfively explained in the Medical Part of my edition of Culpeper, by
which a man or woman, deceiving nature as it were, endeavours to procure thofe
enjoyments which religion has forbidden except when connedted with the happinefs
of being a parent. Such then is the phyfical order which the Author of Nature, the
great preferver of the fpecies as well as the individual, has appointed to induce
man, by the attraction of pleafure, to propagate and continue his race.
According to the ordinary courfe of nature, women are not fit for conception
till after the firft appearance of the menfes. When thefe flop, w hich generally
happens about forty or fifty years of age, they are barren ever after. Their
breafts then fhrink and decay, and the voice becomes feebler. Some, however,
have become mothers before they have experienced any menftrual difcharge*
and others have conceived at the age of fixty, and fometirnes at a more ad-
vanced age. Such examples, though not unfrequent, muft be confidered as
expeptions to the general rule ;
but they are fufficient to fhow that the menftrual
difcharge is not abfolutely effential to generation. The age at which man ac-
quires the faculty of procreating is not fo diftindtly marked. In order to
the production of femen, the body muft have attained a certain growth,
which generally happens between twelve and eighteen years of age. At fixty
or feventy, when the body begins to be enervated by old age, the voice be-
comes weaker, the femen is fecreted in fmaller quantities, and it is often un-
prolific. There are inftances, however, of old men who have procreated at the
age of eighty or ninety. Boys have been found who had the faculty of generating
at
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 137
at nine, ten, or eleven, years of age; and young girls who have become pregnant at
the age of feven, eight, or nine. But fuch fafts, which are very rare, ought to be
confidered as extraordinary phsenomena in the courfe of nature.
At the age of puberty, or a few years after, the body attains its full ftature.
Some young men grow no taller after fifteen or fixteen, and others continue to grow
till the age of twenty or twenty-three. At this period they are very (lender; but by
degrees the members fwell and begin to a(fume their proper (hape; and, before the
age of thirty, the body in men has attained its greateft perfe6tion with regard to
ftrength, confidence, and fymmetry Adolefcence ends at the age of twenty or
twenty-five; and at this period youth (according to the divifion which has been
made of the years of man’s life into different ages) begins. It continues till the
age of thirty or thirty-five.
The common ftature of man is about five feet and three, four, five, fix, or feven,
inches; and of women about five feet, and two, three, and four, inches. Men be-
low five feet are of a fmall ftature. The Laplanders do not exceed four feet and
a half; and the natives of fome other countries are ftill fmaller. Women attain
their full height fooner than men. Haller computes, that, in the temperate climates
of Europe, the medium ftature of men is about five feet and five or fix inches. It
is obferved by the fame author, that inSwifferland the inhabitants of the plains are
taller than thofe of the mountains. It is difficult to afcertain with precifion the
a6tual limits of the human ftature. In furveying the inhabited earth, we find
greater differences in the ftatures of individuals than in thofe of nations. In the
fame climate, among the fame people, and fometimes in the fame family, there are
men whofe ftature is either too tall or too diminutive. —The body, having acquired
its full height during the period of adolefcence, and its full dimenfions in youth,
remains for fome years in the fame date before it begins to decay. This is the pe-
riod of manhood, which extends from the age of thirty or thirty-five to that of
forty or forty-five years. During this ftage, the powers of the body continue in
full vigour, and the principal change which takes place in the human figure arifes
from the formation of fat in different parts. Exceftive fatnefs disfigures the body,
and becomes a very cumberfome and inconvenient load.
The body of a well-(liaped man ought to be fquare, the mufcles ought to be
ftrongly marked, the contour of the members boldly delineated, and the features
of the face well defined. In women, all the parts are more rounded and fofter, the
features are more delicate, and the complexion brighter. To man belong ftrength
and majefty ;
gracefulnefs and beauty are the portion of the other fex. —Every
thing in both fexes points them out as the fovereigns of the earth; even the exter-
nal appearance of man declares his fuperiority to other living creatures. His body

is ereCf; his attitude is that of command; his auguft countenance, which is turned
towards heaven, bears the impreffion of his dignity. The image of his foul is
painted in his face; the excellence of his nature pierces through the material organs,
and gives a fire and animation to the features of his countenance. His majeftic de-
portment, his firm and emboldened gait, announce the noblenefs of his rank. He
touches the earth only with his extremity; he views it only at a diftance, and feems
to defpife it. It has been juftly obferved, that the countenance of man is the mir-
ror of his mind. In the looks of no animal are the expreffions of paffion painted
with fuch energy and rapidity, and with fuch gentle gradations and fhades, as in
thofe of man. We know, that in certain emotions of the mind, the blood rifes to
the face, and produces blufhing; and that in others the countenance turns pale.
Thefe two fymptoms, the appearance of which depends on the ftruCture and tranf-
parency of the reticulum, efpecially rednefs, conftitute a peculiar beauty. In our
climates, the natural colour of the face of a man in good health is white, with a
lively red fuffufed upon the cheeks. Palenefs of the countenance is always a fuf-
picious fymptom. That colour which is fliaded with black is a fign of melancholy
and of vitiated bile; and conftant and univerfal rednefs is a proof that the blood is
carried with too great iinpetuofity to the brain. A livid colour is a morbid and dan-
gerous fymptom; and that which has a tint of yellow is a fign of jaundice or re-
pletion of bile. The colour of the ikin is frequently altered by want of lleep or of
nourishment, or by loofenefs and diarrhoea.
Notwithftanding the general fimilitude of countenance in nations and families,
there is a wonderful diverfity of features. No one, however, is at alofs to recol-
lect the perfon to whom he intends to fpeak, provided he has once fully feen him.
One man has livelinefs and gaiety painted in his countenance, and announces be-
forehand, by the cheerfulnefs of his appearance, the character which he is to fup-
port in fociety. The tears which bedew the cheeks of another man would excite
compaffion in the molt unfeeling heart. Thus the face of man is the rendezvous of
the fymptoms both of his moral and phyfical affeCtions; tranquillity, anger, threat-
ening, joy, fmiles, laughter, malice, love, envy, jealoufy, pride, contempt, difdain
or indignation, irony, arrogance, tears, terror, aftonifhment, horror, fear, fhame or
humiliation, forrow and affliction, compaffion, meditation, particular convulfions,
fleep, death, Sec. See. The difference of thefe characters is of fufficient importance
to form a principal article in the natural hiftory of man.
When the mind is at eafe, all the features of the face are in a Itate of profound
tranquillity. Their proportion, harmony, and union, point out the ferenity of the
thoughts. But, when the foul is agitated, the human face becomes a living canvafs,
whereon the palfions are reprefented with equal delicacy and energy, where every
7 '
emotion
I
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 139
emotion of the foul is exprefled by fome feature, and every adtion by fome mark
;
the lively impreflion of which anticipates the will, and reveals by pathetic figns our
fecret agitation, and thofe intentions which we are anxious to conceal. It is
particularly in the eyes that the foul is painted in the ftrongeft colours and with the
moft delicate fhades.
The different colours of the eyes are, dark hazel, light hazel, green, blue, grey,
and whitilh-grey. The moft common of thefe colours are hazel and blue, both
of which are often found in the fame eye. Eyes which are commonly called black
are only dark hazel ;
they appear black in confequence of being contrafted with
the white of the eye. Wherever there is a tint of blue, however flight, it becomes
the prevailing colour, and outfhines the hazel; with which it is intermixed, to fuch
a degree, that the mixture cannot be perceived without a very narrow examination.
The moft beautiful eyes are thofe which appear black or blue. In the former, there
is more expreflion and vivacity; in the latter, more fweetnefs and perhaps delicacy.
Next to the eyes, the parts of the face by which the phyfiognomy is moft ftrongly
marked are the eye-brows. Being of a different nature from the other parts, their
effect is increafed by contraft. They are like a fliade in a pidture, which gives relief
to the other colours and forms.
The forehead is one of the largeft parts of the face, and contributes moft to its
beauty. Every body knows of how great importance the hair is in the phyfiognomy,
and that baldnefs is a very great defedh When old age begins to make its ap-
proaches, the hair which firft falls off is that which covers the crown of the head
and the parts above the temples. We feldom fee the hair of the lower part of the
temples, or of the back of the head, completely fall of. Baldnefs is peculiar to
men; women do not naturally lofe their hair, though it becomes white, as well as
that of men, at the approach of old age.
The nofe is the moft prominent feature of the face; but, as it has very little mo-
tion, and that only in the moft violent paflions, it contributes lefs to the expreflion
than to the beauty of the countenance. The nofe is feldom perpendicular to the
middle of the face, but for the moft part is turned to one fide or the other. The
caufe of this irregularity, which, according to the painters, is perfectly confident
with beauty, and of which even the want would be a deformity, appears to be fre-
quent prefiure on one fide of the cartilage of the child’s nofe againft the breaft of
the mother when it receives fuck. At this early period of life, the cartilages and
bones have acquired very little folidity, and are eafily bent, as may be obferved in
the legs and thighs of fome individuals, who have been injured by the bandages of
the fwaddling clothes.

Next to the eyes, the mouth and lips have the greateft motion and expreflion.
Thefe motions are under the influence of the paffions. The mouth, which is fet
off by the vermilion of the lips and the enamel of the teeth, marks, by the various
forms which it affumes, their different charadters. The organ of the voice like-
wife gives animation to this feature, and communicates to it more life and expref-
fion than is poffeffed by any of the reft. The cheeks are uniform f eatures, and
have no motion or expreflion excepting from that involuntary rednefs or palenefs
with which they are covered in different paffions; fuch as fhame, anger, pride, and
joy, on the one hand; and fear, terror, and forrow, on the other.
In different paffions, the whole head affumes different pofitions, and is afte&ed
with different motions. It hangs forward during fliame, humility, and forrow
;
it inclines to one fide in languor and compaffion ;
it is elevated in pride; ere£t and
fixed in obftinacy and felf-conceit; in aftonifhment it is thrown backwards; and it
moves from fide to fide in contempt, ridicule, anger, and indignation.—In grief,
joy, love, fliame, and compaffion, the eyes fw.ell and the tears flow. The effufion
of tears is always accompanied with an extenfion of the mufcles of the face, which
opens the mouth.—-In forrow, the corners of the mouth are depreffed, the under
lip rifes, the eye-lids fall down, the pupil of the eye is raifed and half concealed by
the eye-lid. The other mufcles of the face are relaxed, fo that the diftance be-
tween the eyes and the mouth is greater than ordinary; and confequently the
countenance appears to be lengthened. —In fear, terror, confternation, and horror,
the forehead is wrinkled, the eye-brows are raifed, the eye-lids are opened as wide
as poffible, the upper lid uncovers a part of the white above the pupil, which is
depreffed and partly concealed by the under lid. At the fame time;
-
the mouth
opens wide, the lips recede from each other, and difcover the teeth both above and
below.—Xn contempt and derifion, the upper lip is raifed at one fide and expofes
the teeth, while the other fide of the lip irjfl^es a little, and wears the appearance of
a fmile. The noftril on the elevated fide of the lip flirivels up, and the corner of
the mouth falls down. The eye on the fame fide is almoft fhut, while the other is
open as ufual; but the pupils of both are depreffed, as when one looks down from
a height.—In jealoufy, envy, and malice, the eye-brows fall down and are wrinkled;
the eye-lids are elevated, and the pupils are depreffed. The upper lip is elevated
on both fides, while the corners of the mouth are a little depreffed, and the under
lip rifes to join the middle of the upper. —In laughter, the corners of the mouth
are drawn back and a little elevated; the upper part of the cheeks rife; the eyes
are more or lefs clofed; the upper lip rifes, and the under one fails down; the
mouth opens; and, in cafes of immoderate laughter, the fkin of the nolle wrinkles.
That gentler and more gracious kind of laughter which is called fmiling, is feated
wholly
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. .141
\ /
wholly in the parts of the mouth. The under lip rifes; the angles of the mouth
are drawn back; the cheeks are puffed up; the eye-lids approach one another;
and a fmall twinkling is obferved in the eyes. It is very extraordinary, that
laughter may b e excited either by a moral caufe without the immediate action of
external objects, or by a particular irritation of the nerves without any feeling of
joy. Thus an involuntary laugh is excited by a flight tickling of the lips, of the
palm of the hand, of the foie of the foot, of the arm-pits, and below the middle
of the ribs. We laugh when two diffimilar ideas, the union of which was un-
expedted, are pre fented to the mind at the fame time; and when one or both of
thefe ideas, or their union, include fome abfurdity which excites an emotion of
difdain mingled with joy. In general, ftriking contrails never fail to produce
laughter.
—
A change is produced in the features of the countenance by weeping
as well as by laughing. When we weep, the vmder lip is feparated from the
teeth, the forehead is wrinkled, the eye-brows are depreffed, the dimple, which
gives a gracefulnefs to laughter, forfakes the cheek; the eyes are more compreffed;
and almofl conflantly bathed in tears, which in laughter flow more feldom and lefs
copioufly..
The arms, hands, and every part of the body, contribute to the expreflion of
the paffions. In joy, for inftance, all the members of the body are agitated with
quick and various motions. In languor and forrow, the arms hang down, and
the whole body remains fixed and immoveable. In admiration and furprife, this
total fufpenfion of motion is likewife obferved. In love, defire, and hope, the
head and eyes are raifed to heaven, and feem to folicit the wifhed-for good ;
the
body leans forward, as if to approach it ; the arms are ftretched out, and feem to-
fieize beforehand thebeloved objedl. On the contrary, in fear, hatred, and horror,-
the arms feem to pufh backward and repel the objedl of our averfion; we turn
away our head and eyes as if to avoid the fight of it; we recoil in order to fhun it.
Although the human body is externally much more delicate than that of any
other animal, yet it is very nervous, and perhaps llronger in proportion to its lize
than that of the ftrongell animals. We are allured that the porters at Conftantinople-
- carry burdens of nine hundred pounds weight, yet drink nothing but water. A
thoufand wonderful ftories are related of the Hottentots and other favages, concern-
ing their agility in running. Civilized man knows not the full extent of his powers,
nor how much he lofes by that effeminacy and inactivity by which they are weakened
and deftroyed. He is contented even to be ignorant of the ftrength and vigour
which his members are capable of acquiring by motion, and by being accuftomed
to fevere exercifes, as is obferved in runners, tumblers, and rope-dancers. The con-
clufion is, therefore, founded on the moft juft and indifputable induction and
No- 1 0. O o analogy.
142 A KEY TO PHYSIC
analogy. —The attitude of walking is lefs fatiguing to man than that in which he is
placed w hen he is flopped in running. Every time he fets his foot upon the ground,
he paffes over a more confiderable fpace; the body leans forward, and the arms fol-
low the fame diredlion; the refpiration increafes, and breathing becomes difficult.
Leaping begins with great inflexions of the members ;
the body is then much
fliortened, but immediately ftretches itfelf out with a great effort. The motions
which accompany leaping make it very fatiguing.
It is obferved that a ceffation from exercife is not alone fufficient to reftore the
powers of the body when they are exhaufted by fatigue. The fprings, though not
in a61ion, are ftill wound up while we are awake, even when every movement is
fufpended. In Jleep nature finds that repofe which is fuited to her wants; and the
different organs enjoy a falutary relaxation. This is that wonderful ffate in which
man, unconfcious of his own exiftence, and funk in apparent death, repairs the
lofs which his faculties have fuftained, and feems to affume a new exiftence. In this
ftate of drowfinefs and repofe, the fenfes ceafe to a£t, the functions of the body are
fufpended, and it feems abandoned to itfelf. The external fymptoms of fleep, which
alone are the obje&s of our attention, are eaftly diftinguifhed. At the approach of
fleep, the eyes begin to wink, the eye-lids fall down, the head nods and hangs
down: its fall aftonifhes the fleeper; he ftarts up, and makes an effort to drive
away fleep, but in vain ;
a new' inclination, ftronger than the former, deprives him
of the power of raifing his head ;
his chin refts upon his breaft, and in this pofition
he enjoys a tranquil fleep.
The age of decline extends from forty or forty-five to fixty or fixty-five years of
age. At this time of life, the diminution of the fat is the caufe of thofe wrinkles
which begin to appear in the face and fome other parts of the body. The {kin, not
being fupported by the fame quantity of fat, and being incapable, from want of
elafticity, of contra61ing, finks down and forms folds. In the decline of life, a
remarkable change takes place alfo in vifion. In the vigour of our days, the cryf-
talline lens, being thicker and more diaphanous than the humours of the eye, enables
us to read letters of a fmall charadter at the diftance of eight or ten inches.
But, when the age of decline comes on, the quantity of the humours of the eye di-
miniflies, they lofe their clearnefs, and the tranfparent cornea becomes lefs convex.
To remedy this inconvenience, we place what w;
e with to read at a greater diftance
from the eye: but vifion is thereby very little improved, becaufe the image of the
objedt becomes fmaller and more obfcure. Another mark of the decline of life is a
weaknefs of the ftomach, and indigeftion, in moft people who do not take fufficient
exercife in proportion to the quantity and the quality of their food.—At fixty,
fixty-three, or fixty-five, years of age, the figns of decline become more and more
2 vifible,
I
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 145
vifible, and indicate old age. This period commonly extends to the age of feventv,
fometimes to feventy-five, but feldom to eighty. When the body is extenuated
and bent by old age, man then becomes crazy. Crazinefs therefore is nothing but
an infirm old age. The eyes and ftomach then become weaker and weaker; leannefs
increafes the number of the wrinkles; the beard and the hair become white; the
ftrength and the memory begin to fail.—After feventy, or at moil eighty years of
age, the life of man is nothing but labour and furrow : fuch was the language of
David near three thoufand years ago. Some men of ftrong conftitutions, and in
good health, enjoy old age for a long time without decrepitude; but fuch inftances
are not very common. The infirmities of decrepitude continually increafe, and at
length death concludes the whole. This fatal term is uncertain. The only con.
clufions which we can form concerning the duration of life, muft be derived from
obfervations made on a great number of men who were born at the 'fame time, and
who died at different ages.
The figns of decrepitude form a ftriking picture of weaknefs, and announce the
approaching diffolution of the body. The memory totally fails; the nerves be-
come hard and blunted; deafnefs and blindnefs take place; the fenfes of frnell, of
touch, and of tafte, are deftroyed; the appetite fails; the neceffity of eating, and
more frequently that of drinking, are alone felt; after the teeth fall out, maftica-
tion is imperfectly performed, and digeflion is very bad; the lips fall inwards;
the edges of the jaws can no longer approach one another ;
the mufcles of the
lower jaw become fo weak, that they are unable to raife and fupport it; the body
finks down; the fpine is bent outward; and the vertebrae grow together at the
anterior part ;
the body becomes extremely lean : the ftrength fails ; the decrepid
wretch is unable to fupport himfelf; he is obliged to remain on a feat, or ftretched
in his bed : the bladder becomes paralytic ; the inteftines lofe their fpring ; the
circulation of the blood becomes flower; the ftrokes of the pulfe no longer amount
to the number of eighty in a minute, as in the vigour of life, but are reduced to
twenty-four, and fometimes fewer: refpiration is flower; the body lofes its heat;
the circulation of the blood ceafes; death follows; and the dream of life is no
more.
Man, however, has no right to complain of the fhortnefs of life. Throughout
the whole of living beings, there are few who unite in a greater degree all the in-
ternal caufes which tend to prolong its different periods. The term of geftation is
very confiderable ;
the rudiments of the teeth are very late in unfolding; his
growth is flow, and is not completed before about twenty years have elapfed.—The
age of puberty, alfo, is much later in man than in any other animal. In fhort, the
part* of his body, being compofed of a fofter and more flexible fubftance, are not
fo
144 A KEY TO PHYSIC
fo foon hardened as thofe of inferior animals. Man, therefore, feems to receive
at his birth the feeds of a long life: if he reaches not the diftant period which na-
ture feemed to promife him, it mull be owing to accidental or acquired caufes, fo-
reign to himfelf. Inflead of faying that he has finifhed his life, we ought rather to*
fay that he has not completed it. —The natural and total duration of life is in fome
meafure proportioned to the period of growth. A tree or an animal, which foon
acquires its full fize, decays much fooner than another which continues to grow for
a longer time. If it be true that the life of animals is eight times longer than the
period of their growth, we might conclude that the boundaries of human life may
*
be extended to a century and a half.
It does not appear that the life of man becomes {barter in proportion to the length
of time the world has exifted. In the days of the Pfalmift, the ordinary limits of
human life did not exceed feventy or eighty years. No king of Judah lived be-
yond that period. When the Romans, however, were numbered byVefpafian,
there were found in the empire, in that age of effeminacy, ten men aged an hun-
dred and twenty and upwards. Among the princes of modern times, Frederic
the Great of Pruffia lived to the age of 74. George II. of Britain lived to that
of 77. Louis XIV. lived to the fame age. Staniflaus King of Poland and Duke
of Lorrain exceeded that age. Pope Clement XII. lived to the age of 80. George
I. of Britain attained the age of 83. William Lecomte, a fhepherd, died fuddenly

fummit of Mount Jura undertook a journey to Verfailles, to behold and return
thanks to the national affembly for the vote which had freed him and his poor
countrymen from the feudal yoke. In the early part of his life, he was a fervant
in the family of the Prince de Beaufremont. His memory continued .good to the
lafb day of his life; and the principal inconveniences which he felt from his great
age»were, that his fight was weakened, and the natural heat of his body was fo
diminillied, that he fhivered with cold in the middle of the dog-days if he was
not fitting by a good fire. This old man was received in the body of the houfe
by the national affembly, indulged with a chair, and directed to keep on his hat
left he fliould catch cold if he were to fit uncovered. A collection was made for
him by the members, which exceeded 5001. fterling; but he lived not to return to
Mount Jura. He was buried on Saturday the 31ft of January 1790, with great
funeral pomp, in the parifti-church of St. Euftace, at Paris. Mathew Tait, of

Before we proceed to afiign the common caufes of longevity, it is proper to in-
quire into the manner of life and the fituation of thofe by whom it has been enjoyed.
We find, then, that thofe who have lived to the greateft age have been fuch as did
not attain their full growth till a very advanced period of life, and who have kept
their appetites and paflions under the moft complete fubjedlion. In a word, thofe
who have exceeded 100 years, have in general been robuft, laborious, fober, and
careful to obferve the ftridleft regimen. Enjoying a good conftitution from nature,
they have feldom or never been fubjedl to difeafe. They have even enjoyed the
greateft health and vigour, and retained the ufe of their fenfes, to the laft moment
of their lives.
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 147
Among thofe who have led a life of contemplation and ftudy, many have reached
a very advanced age. Longevity is frequent among the different orders of religious,
who by their flatutes are confined to a moderate diet, and obliged to abflain from
wine and the ufe of meat. Some celebrated anchorets have lived to a great age
while- they fed upon nothing but the wfild roots and fruits which they found in the
defert whither they had retired. The philofopher Xenophilus, who lived to the
age of 106, was of the Pythagorean fedt. It is well known, that thofe philofophers
who held the tranfmigration of fouls denied themfelves the ufe of meat, becaule
they imagined that killing an animal would be to affaffinate another felf. A coun-
try life has produced many found and vigorous old men. It is fuppofed that a
happy old age is attained with greater difficulty in towns than in the country. Sir
Hans Sloane, Duverney, and Eonteneile, however, are inftances of men whofe
lives have been lpent in cities, and yet extended to a very great length. It has been
obferved, that men deprived of reafon live very long; which is to be imputed to
their being exempt from thofe inquietudes which are the mofl deadly poifon. Per-
fons poffefling a fufficiently good underftanding, but deflitute of ambition, have
been found to enjoy very long life. Men who are devoid of pretenfions,- who are
free from thofe cares which a defire of filming by a difplay of talents, or of acquir-
ing dignity and power, neceffarily brings in its train, who feel no regret for the
pafl nor anxiety about the future, are flrangers to thofe torments of the mind which
wafle and con-fume the body. To that tranquillity of foul, which is fo excellent a
prerogative of infancy, they add that of being long young by phyfical conftitution,
on which the moral has a linking and powerful influence.
Premature wifdom, and early talents, are often fitter to excite aflonifiiment than
expedtation. The rapid unfolding of the moral faculties, by fiiortening the period
of youth, feems to diminifh in proportion the total duration of life. We have known
a young lady of feventeen, who could fpeak very corredtly feven languages : fhe
tranflated and wrote Latin, Greek, Italian, Spanifh, German, Englifh, and French;
but fhe died at the age of eighteen. The young man by whom the was afked in
marriage, having been informed that he could not obtain her hand till he had made
himfelf worthy of her by the fame degree of talents and information, died the fame
year, and at the fame age.
From the preceding obfervations, Haller has attempted to deduce the caufes
why a few men are longer exempted than others from the common fate.—The cir-
cumftances which oppofe their influence are independent of our will; fuch as the
ravages of epidemic diftempers; trouble and anxiety of mind, which create difeafes
in the body : or the torments of ambition. It is neceffary to live in a falubrious
climate; to enjoy a fortune fufficiently eafy to exclude thofe uneafy defires which

create a feeling of want and privation; to be defcended from healthy parents, to
avoid drinking wine in youth ;
to drink water ;
and to eat little meat, and a great
deal of vegetables. It is neceffary alfo to be temperate in meals; moderate in plea-
fures, ftudy, and exercife ;
to be naturally inclined to cheerfulnefs ;
and to allot
a due time to deep and repofe. —Long life is certainly very rare; but, as has been
already obferved, we muft diftinguifh between what is natural to the conftitution
of man and that which is the confequence of his condition. By the former he is
made to be long-lived : but nature is arrefted in her courfe by local and accidental
caufes, which it is nof always in our power to avoid.
Let us take a retrofpedtive view of man’s life from his infancy, and enumerate
the chief of thefe different caufes. Of a thoufand infants, extracted from the Lon-
don bills of mortality, twenty-three died almoft as foon as they came into the world ;
teething carried off fifty, and convulfions two hundred and feventy-feven : eighty
died of the fmall-pox, and feven of the mealies. Among the adult females, eight
at lead died in child-bed: confumption and afthma, difeafes more frequent in Eng-
land than in France, carried off a hundred and ninety-one of the fame fex, and
almoft a fifth part of the full-grown men. A hundred and fifty died of fevers.
At a more advanced age, twelve died of apoplexy, and forty-one of dropfy, with-
out mentioning thofe to whom difeafes of little importance in themfelves became
mortal. There only remained feventy-eight whofe death could be aferibed to old'
age; and of thefe twenty-feven lived to the age of eighty and upwards. Among
the different difeafes of which we have juft now feen the fatal effedts, and which
carry off more than nine-tenths of mankind, not one, it muft be allowed, is na-
tural to the conftitution. The inhabitants of this ifland are in general but little
fubjedt to difeafes, excepting the fmall-pox and the mealies; and many of them
enjoy uninterrupted health to old age. —And here it may be proper to mention
what are the moft prevalent difeafes in other countries, which prove equally
fatal to the duration of human life. In northern climates, feurvy, the cholic of
the Laplanders, and the difeafes of the lungs, moft frequently occafion death. In
temperate climates, dropfy carries oft' a great many at the beginning of old age,
which is the boundary of life in the greateft part of both fexes, when they have
efcaped the acute difeafes, fuch as putrid fever, &c. Acute diieales are moft com-
mon in warm countries. In fome places, the rays of the fun kill in a few hours
thofe who are expofed to its burning heat. The air of Egypt and of Afia Minor
engenders the plague, by which one half of their inhabitants are carried off. Be-,
tween the tropics men are fubjedl to dyfenteries and violent fevers. The cold of
the night, in warm climates, occafions fometimes violent difeafes, fuch as palfy,
quinfey, and a fwelling of the head. Damp and marlhy places give rife to fevers

of a different kind, hut alfo very dangerous. The life of failors has a great ten-
dency to produce fcurvy. How many profeffions prove fatal to the health, and
haften that period which nature would have brought on by flow degrees ! Miners,
ftone'-cutters, gilders, perfons employed in emptying privies, &c. are fubjedt to
difeafes of the lungs, and become paralytic. Other profelfions of life bring on
other accidents, of which it would carry us too far to give a particular account.
What has been faid is fufficient to fhow, that it is the dangers with which we are
furrounded that fhorten the period of human exiftence.
By examining the lift of thofe who have attained a great age, it will be found that
mankind are longer lived in northern than in fouthern countries. It has been
obferved, that there are more old men in mountainous and elevated fttuations than
in plains and low countries. We repeat it, if the duration of life among the inhabi-
tants of fouthern climates be compared with the duration of life in northern nations,
it will be allowed, that the latter enjoy both longer life and better health than the
former. Their growth being retarded by the rigour of the climate, their decay
muft alfo be flower, becaufe of the proportion which exifts between the growth of
animals and the length of their lives. Among ten perfons who have lived to the
age of an hundred, eight or nine will be found to have lived in the north.
It appears from the bills of mortality, that in the country more boys are born
than girls; in cities, on the contrary, the number of females is commonly greateft.
Obfervations made with great care prove, that in moft countries there are fewer men
alive than women, and that more males die, chiefly at the firft and laft periods of
life. In Sweden, the whole number of females, in 1763, was to that of males in the
proportion of ten to nine. The number of old women who exceeded eighty years
of age was to that of old men of the fame age in proportion of thirty-three to
nineteen ;
and there were more women than men who had attained the age of eighty-
fix, in proportion of almoft two to one.
Dr. Price made obfervations, after Dr. Percival, on the difference of longevity,
and the duration of human life, in towns, country-pariflies, and villages;
of which the following is the refult: a greater number in proportion die in
great towns than in ftnall ones, and a greater number in the latter than in vil-
lages. The caufe of this difference, which is found to be very great, muft be, in
the firft place, the luxury and diflipation which prevail in towns; and, fecondly,
the badnefs of the air. In the town of Manchefter, according to obfervation, l-28th
of the inhabitants die annually; whereas in the neighbouring country, the number
of deaths does not exceed l-46th of the wdiole inhabitants.. It may be laid down
as a general principle, that in great towns, the number of deaths annually is from*

one in nineteen to one in twenty-two or twenty-three ;
in middling towns, from
one in twenty-four to one in twenty-eight; and in country parities and villages
feldom more than one in forty or fifty. In 1763, the number of inhabitants in
Stockholm amounted to 72979. The average number of deaths for the fix years
preceding had been 3802, which makes one in nineteen annually; while through-
out all Sweden, including the towns and the country, not more than one in thirty-five
die annually. At Rome the inhabitants are numbered every year. In 1771 they
were found to amount to 159675: the average number of deaths for ten years was
7 367 ;
which makes one in twenty-three and a half annually. In London not lei's
than one in twenty three-fourths of the inhabitants die every year.
M. Daubenton has given, in the Encyclopedic M6thodique, a table of the proba-
bilities of the duration of life, conftrudted from that which is to be found in the
feventh volume of the Supplemens a l’Hifloire Naturelle de M. de Buffon. The
following is an abridgement of it
:
Of twenty-three thoufand nine hundred and ninety-four children, born at the
fame time, there will probably die,

It thus appears, that a very fmall number of men indeed pafs through all the pe-
riods of life, and arrive at the goal marked out by nature. Innumerable caufes ac-
celerate our diffolution. The life of man, we have obferved, confifts in the adtivity
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 151
and exercife of his organs, which grow up and acquire ftrength during infancy,
adolefcence, and youth. No fooner has the body attained its utmoft perfe&ion,
than it begins to decline. Its decay is at firft imperceptible; but in the progrefs of
time the membranes become cartilaginous, the cartilages acquire the confiftence of
bone; the bones become more folid, and all the fibres are hardened. Almoft all
the fat waftes away; the fkin becomes withered and fcaly ;
wrinkles are gradually
formed; the hair grows white; the teeth fall out; the face lofes its fiiape; the
body is bent; and the colour and confifience of the cryftalline humour become
more perceptible. The firft traces of this decay begin to be perceived at the age
of forty, and fometimes fooner; this is the age of decline. They increafe by flow
degrees till fixty, which is the period of old age. They increafe more rapidly till the
age of feventy or feventy-five. At this period crazinefs begins, and continues
always to increafe. Next fucceeds decrepitude, when the memory is gone, the ufe of
the fenfes loft, the ftrength totally annihilated, the organs worn out, and the func-
tions of the body almoft deftroyed. Little now remains to be loft; and, before the
age of ninety or a hundred, death terminates at once decrepitude and life.
The body then dies by little and little; its motion gradually dkniniflies; life is
extinguifhed by fucceflive gradations, and death is only the laft term in the fuc-
cefiion. When the motion of the heart, which continues longeft, ceafes, man has
then breathed his laft ;
he has pafied from the ftate of life to the ftate of death; and,
as at his birth a breath opened to him the career of life, fo with a breath he finiflies
his courfe.
This natural caufe of death is common to all animals, and even to vegetables.
We may obferve that the centre of an oak firft perifhes and falls into the duft, be-
caufe thefe parts, having become harder and more compa6t, can receive no further
nourifhment. The caufes of our diffolution, therefore, are as neceflary as death is
inevitable; and it is no more in our power to retard this fatal term than to alter
the eftabliflied laws of the univerfe. Hence the following maxim has been uni-
verfally adopted ;
Contra vim mortis, nullum medicamentum in Jiortis. In whatever
manner death happens, the time and circumftances thereof are unknown. It is
confidered, however, as at all times terrible, and the very thoughts of it fill the
mind with fear and trouble. It is notwithrftanding our duty frequently to direct
our thoughts to that event, which muft inevitably happen, and by a life of virtue
and innocence to prepare againft thofe confequences which we fo much dread.
As in women the bones, the cartilages, the mufeies, and every other part of the
body, are fofter and lefs folid than thofe of men, they muft require more time in
hardening to that degree which occafions death. —Women of courfe ought to live
longer than men. This reafoning is confirmed by experience; for, by confulting
4- the
152 A KEY TO PHYSIC
the bills of mortality, it appears, that, after women have palled a certain age, they
live much longer than men who have arrived at the fame age.—In like manner, it
is found by experience, that in women the age of youth is Ihorter and happier than
in men, but that the period of old age is longer, and attended with more trouble.
Citius pubefcunt,
citius fenefcunt.
After death, the organization of the body begins to be dilfolved, and all the parts
relax, corrupt, and feparate. This is produced by an inteftine fermentation,
which occafions putrefa&ion, and reduces the body to volatile alkali, fetid oil,
and earth.
The defire of felf-prefervation, and of protracting the Ihort fpan of life, is fo in-
timately interwoven with our conftitution, that it is juftly efteemednne of the firft
principles of our nature, and, in fpite even of pain and mifery, feldom quits us to
the lalt moments of our exiftence. It feems, therefore, to be no lefs our duty than
our intereft to examine minutely into the various means that have been confidered
as conducive to health and long life; and, if poffible, to diftinguifh fuch circum-
ftances as are effential to that great end, from thofe which are merely accidental.
It has long been known that frelh air is more immediately neceffary to life than
food; for a man may live two or three days without the latter, but not many mi-
nutes without the former. The vivifying principle contained in the atmofphere, fo
effential to the fupport of flame, as well as animal life, concerning which authors
have propofed fo many conjedures, is nothing elfe but the pure oxygenated
fluid difcovered by that ingenious philofopher Lavoifier. The common atmofphere
may well be fuppofed to be more or lefs healthy in proportion as it abounds
with this animating principle. As this exhales in copious ftreams from the green
leaves of all kinds of vegetables, even from thofe of the moft poifonous kind, may
we not, in fome meafure, account why inftances of longevity are fo much more
frequent in the country than in large cities; where the air, inftead of partaking fo
largely of this falutary impregnation, is daily contaminated with noxious animal
effluvia.
With refped to climate, various obfervations confpire to prove, that thofe regions
which lie within the temperate zones are beft calculated to promote long life.
Hence, perhaps, may be explained, why Italy has produced fo many long livers,
and why iflands in general are more falutary than continents ;
cf which Bermudas
and fome others afford examples. And it is a pleafing circumftance that our own
ifland appears to contain far more inftances of longevity than could well be ima-
gined. The ingenious Mr. Whitehurft affures us, from certain fads, that Englifh-
men are in general longer lived than North Americans; and that a Britifh; confti-
tution will laft longer, even in that climate, than a native one. But it muft be
allowed
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 153
allowed in general, that the human conftitution is adapted to the peculiar ftate and
temperature of each refpedtive climate, fo that no part of the habitable globe can
be pronounced too hot or too cold for its inhabitants. Yet, in order to promote a
friendly intercourfe between the moll remote regions, the Author of nature has
wifely enabled the inhabitants to endure great and furprifing changes of temperature
with impunity.
Though foods and drink of the moll fimple kinds are allowed to be the belt cal-
culated for fupporting the body in health, yet it can hardly be doubted but variety
may be lately indulged occafionally, provided men would retlrain their appetites
within the bounds of temperance; for bountiful Nature cannot be fuppofed to have
poured forth fuch a rich profufion of provifions, merely to tantalize the human
fpecies, without attributing to her the part of a cruel ftep-dame, inftead of that of
a kind and indulgent parent. Befides, we find, that, by the wonderful powers
of the digeftive organs, a variety of animal and vegetable fubflances, of very dis-
cordant principles, are happily affimilated into one bland homogeneous chyle;
therefore it feems natural to diftruft thofe cynical writers, who would rigidly confine
mankind to one fimple difh, and their drink to the mere water of the brook.
Nature, it is true, has pointed out that mild infipid fluid as the univerfal diluent,
and therefore moft admirably adapted for our daily beverage : but experience has
equally proved, that vinous and fpirituous liquors, on certain occafions, are no
lefts falutary and beneficial, whether it be to fupport ftrength againft ficknefs or
bodily fatigue, or to exhilarate the mind under the preffure of heavy misfortunes.
But, alas ! what Nature meant for innocent and ufeful cordials, to be ufed only
occafionally, and according to the diredlion of reafon,. cuftoin and caprice have,
by degrees, rendered habitual to the human frame, and liable to the moft enormous
and deftrudtive abufes. Hence it may be juftly doubted, whether gluttony and in-
temperance have not depopulated the world more than even the fword, peftilence,
and famine. True, therefore, is the oLd maxim, Modus utendi ex oeneno facit medi~
camentum, ex medicamento xenenum.
It is allowed on all hands, that alternate motion and reft, and fleep and watch-
ing, are neceffary conditions to. health and longevity ;
and that they ought to be
adapted to age, temperament, conftitution, temperature of the climate, &c. but
the errors which mankind daily commit in thefe refpedts become a fruitful fource of
difeafes. While fome- are bloated and relaxed with eafe and indolence, others are
emaciated and become rigid through hard labour, watching, and fatigue.—Where
the animal fundlious are duly performed, the fecretions go on regularly; and the
different evacuations fo exadfly correfpond to the quantity of aliment taken in, in a
given time, that the body is found to return daily to nearly the fame weight. If any.

particulas' evacuation happen to be preternaturally diminiftied, Tome other eva-
cuation is proportionally augmented, and the equilibrium is commonly preferved ;
but continued irregularities, in thefe important functions, cannot but terminate in
difeafe. —The due regulation of the paffions, perhaps, contributes more to health
and longevity than that of any other of the non-naturals. The animating paffions,
fuch as joy, hope, love, &c. when kept within proper bounds, gently excite the
nervous influence, promote an equable circulation, and are highly conducive to
health ;
while the deprcfling affections, fuch as fear, grief and defpair, produce the
contrary effe<5l, and lay the foundation of the moft formidable difeafes.
From the light which hiftory affords us, as well as from the foregoing lift of
long lives, there is great reafon to believe, that longevity is in fome meafure here-
ditary; and that healthy long-lived parents would commonly tranfmit the fame to
their children, were it not for intemperance, and the frequent errors in medical ad-
vice, which fo evidently tend to the abbreviation of human life. —Where is it, but
from thefe caufes, and the unnatural modes of living, that, of all the children which
are born in the capital cities of Europe, nearly one half die in early infancy? To
whatelfe can we attribute thisextraordinary mortality? Such an amazing proportion
of premature deaths is a circutnftance unheard-of among favage nations, or among
the young of other animals! In the earlieft ages, we are informed, that human life
was protradled to a very extraordinary length; yet how few perfons, in thefe latter
times, arrive at that period which nature feems to have defigned! Man is by na-
ture a field-animal, and feems deftined to rife with the fun, and to fpend a large
portion of his time in the open air, to inure his body to robuft exercifes and the
inclemency of the feafons, and to make a plain homely repaft only when hunger
dilates. But art has ftudioufly defeated the kind intentions of nature; and, by
enflaving him to all the blandifhrnents of fenfe, has left him, alas ! an eafy victim
to folly and caprice. Let the confideration of the following fubjefts dire6t every
one, who values health and long life, to purfue the meanj nature has pointed out
for their prefervation and fuftenance.
Of NUTRITION.
NUTRITION, in the animal eeconomy, is the acceffion of new parts to the
body, either for its augmentation, or for the reparation of fuch as are worn off,
or exhaled through the pores and perfpiiing veffels, whereby the fluids are dimi-
niftied, and the body falls away. So that, to preferve life, it is neceffary that a.
reftitution be made to the juices and folids of the body, at leaft equal to whatis
loft by thofe motions; which is what we call the action of nutrition
•
Now, the
loft juices are eafily and quickly fupplied by aliment, air, &c. but the nutrition
o ... of

of the folid parts is much more obfcure. This, indeed, has proved a fubjeft of
infinite doubts and differences among authors; nor had we any rational or fatjsfac-
tory account of the fame, till that of the accurate Boerhaave, whofe do&rine is as
follows.
Every folid part of the body confifts of other fmaller ones, in all refpefts like the
larger; veffels, of veficles, and thofe of others flill fmaller; bones, of officles, &e.
Which flru&ure goes beyond all limits of fenfe, however affifted by art; as appears
by the experiments and obfervations of Malpighi, Ruyfch, Leeuwenhoek, and
Hooke. Yet it is fcarcely poffible this divifion and fubdivifion fliould be infinite, as
thofe of foods and juices are. Again, it appears from microfcopes, inje&ions,
fmall wounds, exficcations, &c. that the folid parts of the body are very fin all,
compared with the fluids; and it is alfo demonflrable, from confidering the rife
and generation of the veffels, and the refolution of the greater veffels into their
fmaller constituent ones, that all the folid mafs of the body is conftrufred of mere
nerves, as its elements. And, in effect, all this mafs, an incredible fmall particle
only excepted, at firft arofe out of what was a very fmall colliquament, much like
the nervous juice itfelf; as is abundantly fhown by the great Malphighi, in his two
treatifes on incubated eggs. For neither does the white of the egg nourifh, till, by
means of the incubation, it has paffed innumerable degrees of fluidity, from its
firft thicknefs, to that exceeding fubtilty wherein it terminates. But, even then,
the liquor, thus given to the embryo, is exceedingly thick, in comparifon with
what it is to be when converted into its veffels and vifeera. Now, the firft tender
folids, ariftng from this fubtle humour, do again pafs infinite intermediate degrees,
before they arrive at their utmoft ftate and confiftence; as is fhown by Malpighi in
eggs, and by Ruyfch in embryoes and foetufes. Hence, therefore, it follows, that
the folids, in their firft formation out of the liquids whence they arife, only differ
from them in reft, cohefion, and figure. Therefore fuch a particle, now in its
fluid ftate, will become a part of the folid to be formed out of it, as foen as there
happens to be a power to effect its cohefion with the other folid parts, howfoever
that cohefion be effected.
This cohefion is eafily produced in a fibre already formed, if there happen to be
a proper cavity in the folid, left open by fome loft particle, and, at the fame time,
a particle in the fluid, anfwerable thereto in bulk, figure, and nature; and, laftly,
if there be a power wherewithal to intrude it into that place, or accomodate it
thereto. Thus will arile a real nutrition of the folids in the minute veffels, by
whofe union the large ones are formed; that is, in the nerves, or in veffels fimilar
thereto. Which being impra6ticable by any other liquid than that brought into
thefe veffels, it appears very evident, that the nervous juice, at leaft a juice perfe&iy
like
V
156 A KEY TO PHYSIC
like it, is the immediate matter of nutrition: whence nutrition appears one of the
laft and moil perfedt adtions of the body; fince, to have this laudable, all the pre-
cedent adtions mult of neceffity have been fo. The chyle, therefore, which fome
make the immediate matter of nutrition, is, indeed, fitted to fill the larger veffels
;
but it cannot nourifh or reftore them. This, when attenuated, changed, more
intimately mixed in the lungs by means of refpiration, and thus fitted for the
paffage of certain veffels, is indeed rendered fitter, yet far from being quite fit, to
be the matter of nutrition. But, by the repeated adtion of the lungs, the vifcera,
veffels, &c. there is formed, out of this humour, a foft, tenacious, plafiic, infipid,
ferum, which, thickening by the fire, becomes perfedtly like the white of an egg.
This fluid, therefore, has in it all the conditions found in that, from whence, by
fure experience, we know all the folid parts of an animal arife by mere incubation.
It is, therefore, a ffep nearer; but is not yet quite difpofed for nutriment; much
lefs is the cruor, or red globular part of the blood, fo. Neither are yet fitted to
enter the veffels; yet both the one and the other are, by different authors, made
the nutritive juice. But, as the heat of the incubation, fo the action of the vifcera
and veffels on the ferum, introduces various changes therein, till at length a part of
it be rendered fubtile enough for the purpofe required. This, when exhauded,
is inflantly repaired: and thus we have the true immediate matter of nutrition.
The matter of nutrition thus afcertained, the manner wherein, and the caufe
whereby, it is effedted, are as follows : A juice being driven diredtly through a full,
conic or cylindric, elaflic or rigid, canal ;
if its courfe be from a wider to a nar-
rower part, or if it have any thing to oppofe its motion, will endeavour to ftretch
the Tides of its canal, according to the axis of its length. This mud be the cafe
every-where in the body, except, perhaps, in the veins and receptacles. By this
nifus, or endeavour, how weak foever, continually repeated, the veffels "ill be
infenfibly lengthened out; and, in lengthening, they will be made more and more
Header. Hence the laft extremities of the veffels, which in man are extremely
fmall, are continually ftretched, and rendered lefs and lefs coherent, i. e. dill
nearer and nearer to a diffolution; and thus at length will they cohere fo weakly,
as fcarcely to differ from fluids. While fuch motion goes on, therefore, and the
propulfion is continued, there will, of neceffity, happen thefe two things: Fird,
the outmoft particles of the minuted tubes being torn off, will again be converted
into a kind of humour, what part of the body foever they dick in. Secondly, the
fmalleft particles, which, by their union, compofed the (tendered fibrillte, will be
fo feparated from each other, as to leave open interdices in thofe places, where,
before, they cohered. Both thefe effedts will be produced at all times, and in all
parts of the body, fo long as life continues, efpecially where nature is ftrong, and
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. U7
Che actions of the body violent. But the fame humour whereby thefe effe&s are pro-
duced containing abundance of particles fimilar to thofe thus feparated and loft, con-
veys and applies them to thofe interftices, by that veryimpetus whereby itendeavours
to diftend the canals; and, thus intercepted, at length it forms, adapts, and faftens,
them, fo as to adhere in the fame manner as the former. The matter, preparation,
application, energy of motion, ftill remaining the fame; what, from time to time,
is loft, is- thus prefently reftored ;
and the folids continue in the fame ftate as before,
that is, they are perpetually nourifhed, and fupplied, and preferved.
In this the Creator’s wifdom is very confpicuous; in that the fame power which
inevitably deftroys does repair again at the fame time, and by the fame adtion;
and that, the greater the lofs is, the more copious the fupply; and, laftly, that
thofe parts firft fpent in the adtion of the body are the firft reftored. Farther, it
is evident, that the newer, the more tender, and the nearer to the moving caufe,
thefe velfels are, the more eafily will they be lengthened, diftended, deftroyed, and
repaired : our bodies, therefore, the nearer to the origin, the more do they grow.
For, the action ftill continuing, the greater veflels become more extended by their
fluid; and at the fame time the fmaller, whereof the membranes or coats, of the
larger fort are compofed, are comprefled, dried, and at laft concreted, and grow
up ;
whence arifes a firmnefs, indeed, of the fibres, but a lofs of the veficles. Thus
what were formerly veflels commence mere hard ligaments; and thus, the fluids
being once fixed, the feveral veflels coalefce; from the concurrence of thefe caufes
arife the ftrength, hard nefs, rigidity, and thicknefs, of the folid parts. Hence the
number of veflels is greateft in embryoes, and, as age comes on, it fenfibly dimi-
nifhes; and hence it is, that their weaknefs conftantly declines, and their ftrength
and firmnefs increafe. In young people, therefore, the quantity of humours is
redundant, and greatly exceeds the folids : in old men, the folids exceed the fluids.
And hence we fee the reafon, manner, and appearance, of growth, ftate, declenfion,
and, at length, of death from pure old age.
A perfon who confiders this account, and compares it with what is adtually ob-
fervable in the body, will find every circumftance to obtain: thus the whole cuti-
cula is every-where, and at all times, conftantly defquamating, peeling off, and
again renewing; and thus the hair, nails, teeth, continually rubbed, torn, and
worn off, come again :
parts taken off from the veflels and the bones foon grow
again : and the fordes, or filth, rubbed off from the extremities of the veflels,
when examined by a microfcope, or diluted, and viewed in water, appear plainly to
confift both of folid and fluid parts; and thofe carried off by wafhing, fhaving, &c.
are the fame. Hence too, we fee, that a general increafe of the bulk of the body,
with regard to habit, as in fat, flelhy, brawny, perfons, does not arife from any
No. 11. S f increafe
158 A KEY TO PHYSIC
increafe of the folids, but by their extenfion into larger cavities, crowded with dag-
nant humours. And hence fatnefs becomes hurtful, as it loads, weakens, and
fuffocates. Whence arifes a very confiderable didin6tion between nutrition and
repletion, to which a physician fhould have fpecial regard; the one drengthening
and condenfing the veffels ;
the other weakening, loofening, and extending, the
fame. Hence, laftly, we fee why the fabric of the folids is not deftroyed by the
contained fluids; how our machine comes to fubfift fo long; why, when a nerve
is corrupted, the nutrition of that part it belongs to ceafes; and why the fame
obtains in an artery ;
why in an embryo there are no folids, in a foetus very few,
in old men a great deal; and why even the nerves, tendons, arteries, and recep-
tacles, become fird cartilaginous, and then bony. Dr. Prieftley concludes, from
fome experiments undertaken with a view of difcovering the principle of nutrition
in vegetable and animal fubftances, that this principle is phlogiston, in fuch a date
as to be capable of becoming, by putrefaction, a true inflammable air, (hydro-
genous gas ;) but not generally fuch as to burn with explolion, but rather with a
blue and lambent flame, mixed with a certain proportion of fixed air. This prin-
ciple in nutrition is immediately held in folution by the galtric juice, and in the
chyle formed by it; and, when it has entered into the circulation with the chyle, and
anfwered the purpofe in the animal oeconomy for which it is defigned, it is thrown
out again by means of the blood in the lungs, and communicated to the air, which
is phlogidicated with it.
Of FOOD, or ALIMENT.
FROM aliment, or food, by the procefs of digeftion, is prepared a very mild,
fweet, and whitifh, liquor, refembling milk, and didinguifhed by the name of
chyle; which, being abforbed by the laCleal veins, by them conveyed into the cir-
culation, and there affimilated into the nature of blood, affords that fupply of nu-
trition, which, as we have feen above, the continual wade of the body is found to
require. Food is the mod neceffary thing for the prefervation of our bodies : and,
as on the choice thereof our health greatly'depends, it is of much importance to un-
derdand, in general, what is the propered for our nourifhment ;
and, in particular
deviations from health, what is the bed adapted to redore us. Our blood and
juices naturally incline to become putrid and acrimonious : frefh chyle, duly re-
ceived, prevents this dedru6live tendency, and preferves in them that mild date
which alone confids with health. An animal diet affords the mod of this bland
nutritious mucilage ;
watery fluids dilute the too grofs parts, and carry off what
is become unfit for ufe. It is only the fmall portion of jelly which is feparated from
the farinaceous parts of vegetables, that, after being much elaborated, is con-
verted
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 1.59
'verted into the animal nature; yet the ufe of vegetables prevents both repletion and
a too great tendency to a putrefcent acrimony of the blood. In hot climates, as
well as againft the conftitutional beat of particular perfons, vegetables are demand-
ed in the largeft portion ;
animal fubftances afford the higheft relitli while our ap-
petite continues; but will fate the appetite before the ftomach is duly filled. Ve-
getables may be eaten after either fiefii or fifh : few herbs or fruits fatiate fo much
as that the ftomach may not be filled with them when it is already fatisficd with
Helh or fifh; whence it may be obferved, that no diet which is very nourifhing can
be eaten to fulnefs, becaufe its nutritious parts are oily and fatiating. Health de*.
pends almoft wholly on a proper crafts of the blood; and to preferve this, a mixture
of vegetables in fome degree is always required, for a loathing is foon the confe-
quence of animal food alone: hot acrid habits, too, receive from milk and vegeta-
bles the needful for corredting their excefies ;
but in cold, pituitous, and nervous,
habits, which want moft nourifhment from leaft digeftion, and from the fmalleft
quantity of food, animal diet is to be ufed more freely.
As the blood, the nutritive juice, and in general all the parts of the body, are
made up of three elements, viz. of one which is fulphureous, oily, and inflam-
mable; of one of an earthy, fubtile, alkaline, nature; and of one of an aqueous
nature: fo the feveral kinds and virtues of food may be moft commodioufly re-
duced to thefe three claffes; and aliments of thefe three feveral qualities, duly mix-
ed with one another, afford a proper nourifiiment for the human body.—The flefli
of animals, efpecially when roafted, affords the body its principal fupply of the
fulphureous part; but it is to be obferved, that wild animals are preferable in this
refpeft to the tame and domeftic kind, becaufe their oils and falts are exalted by
'habitual exercife. Among the aliments which furnifti the blood with its humid
parts, of animals, fifh; and of vegetables, pot-herbs, the milder roots, and fome
fummer-fruits; are reckoned the principal. To the third clafs, which fupplies the
blood with its fixed and earthy parts, belong all kinds of grain, as the feveral forts
of bread, rice, peafe, beans, lentils, chefnuts, almonds, cocoa, cheefe, &c. From
what has been faid, it will appear that all fuch aliments as are of a mild quality,
and refemble the chyle and blood, are fit for nourifiiment; that all fuch food as
either recedes from, or is quite oppofite to, the nature of the chyle and blood, is
unfit for nourifhing the parts; that all food in which there is too much of an acid,
is improper for nourifhment, becaufe milk and blood will not mix with an acid,
which is quite oppofite to their natures, and induces a coagulation of the circulat-
ing juices ;
that all falts, and all foods too highly ftalted, muft be unfit for nou-
rifliment, becaufe no fait whatever can be mixed with the blood, chyle, and milk;
and
I
160 A KEY TO PHYSIC
and laftly, that the free ufe of fpirits muft be very detrimental both to health and
nourilliment, becaufe blood and chyle never incorporate with fpirituous liquors, but
rather feparate from them.
Thus much being obvious as general principles with refpe6t to the matter and
quality of our aliment, the valetudinarian may eafily regulate his diet with fome ad-
vantage to himfelf by an attention to the few enfuing particulars. In winter, eat
freely, but drink fparingly : roaft meat is to be preferred, and what is drunk lhould
be ftronger than at other feafons. In fummer, let thirft determine the quantity to
be drunk; cold ftomachs never require much: boiled meats and vegetables,, if
not otherwife contradi&ed, may now be more freely ufed. Lax habits require
the winter’s diet to be continued all the year, and rigid ones lhould be confined to
that of fummer. Oceafional fading will prevent the neceflity of periodical bleeding,
&c. Thofe who are troubled with eradiations occafioned by their food lhould
drink but little, and ufe fome unaccuftomed exercife. The thirfly lhould drink
freely, but eat fparingly. In general, let moderation be obferved; and, though no
dinner hath been had, a light fupper is at all times to be preferred. After very
high feafoned meats, a glafs of water acidulated with the acid elixir of vitriol, or in
very weak ftomachs the fweet elixir of vitriol,, is far more affiftant to the work of
digeftion than the common method of taking brandy.
As to common drink, water alone is fufficient and effedlual for all the purpofes of
nature. Strong liquors were never defigned for common ufe. They were formerly
kept here in England, as other medicines are, in apothecaries’ Ihops, and prefcribed
by phyficians, as they do diafcordium, and Venice treacle, to refrelh the weary,
ftrengthen the weak, and raife the low-fpirited. The effect of the ordinary ufe of
wine and fpirituous liquors, as natural caufes will always produce their effe&s*'
is to inflame the body into gout, ftone, and rheumatifm, fevers, pleurifies, fmall-
pox, &c. to dry up the juices, and fcorch and Hirivel the folids. Thofe whofe ap-
petite and digeftion are good and entire, never want ftrong liquors to fupply them
with fpirits; fuch fpirits are too volatile and fugitive for any folid or ufeful pur-
pofes of life. Two ounces of flelh.-meat, well digefted, beget a greater ftock of
more durable and ufeful fpirits than ten times as much ftrong liquor.
All ftrong liquors are as hard to digeft, and require as much labour of the con-
co6tive powers, as ftrong food itfelf. Water is the only univerfal diflolvent, or
menftruum, and the moft certain diluter of all bodies proper for food. There are
a great many fpirituous liquors, which not only will not diftolve, but which will
harden, and make more indigeftible, certain parts, efpecially the falts of bodies,
wherein their a6tive qualities, that is, thofe which can..do moft harm to human con-
ftitutions,
2
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 161
ftitutions, confift. And we have known perfons of tender conftitutions, who could
neither eat nor digeft upon drinking wine, but who, by drinking at meals common
water, warmed, have recovered their appetites and digeftion, and have thriven
and grown plump. It is true, ftrong liquors, by their heat, and Simulation on the
organs of conco&ion, by increaling the velocity of the motion of the fluids, and
thereby quickening the other animal functions, will carry off the load that lies upon
the ftomach, with more prefent cheerfulnefs. But then, befides the future damage
of fuch a quantity of wine to the ftomach and fluids, by its heat and inflammation,
the food is hurried into the habit unconcofted, and lays a foundation for a fever,
a fit of the cholic, or fome chronical difeafe. With refpeft to fermented liquors,
which are commonly ufed, it may be obferved, that thofe which are too ftrong
hurt digeftion, and are fo far from ftrengthening the body, that they weaken and
relax it. They keep up a conftant fever, which exhaufts the fpirits, heats and in-
flames the blood, difpofes to numberlefs difeafes, and occafions a premature old
age. But fermented liquors may be too weak, as well as too ftrong : thefe muft
either be drunk new, before the fermentation is over, and in this cafe will generate
air in the bowels, and occafion flatulencies; or they foon become ftale, four the
ftomach, and injure digeftion. On this account all malt liquors, cider, &c. fhould
be fufticiently ftrong to keep till they are ripe, and then they fhould be ufed ; and
neither fooner nor later. Liquors that are adulterated with a mixture of ingredi-
ents of the opiate kind, which are poifonous in their quality, as they moftly are by
thofe who make them for fale, hurt the nerves, relax and weaken the ftomach, and
fpoil its digeftive powers.
A due regulation of the quantity and quality of our meat and drink, and a nice
adjuftment thereof to the conco6tive powers, is of the utmoft confequence to health
and long life. What we expend in motion, excretion, effluvia, &c. is but a deter-
minate quantity; and the fupply fhould only keep pace with the expence; a juft
proportion of the two would, probably, preferve us from acute diftempers, as it
certainly would from chronical ones; moft or all of which proceed from reple-
tion, as appears from their being cured by evacuation.
Phyftcians have attempted to determine the healthful quantity of food for a hu-
man body. Some fay, that in winter, when the perfpiration of an unexercifed per-
fon is only equal to the urine, the diet for twenty-four hours ought not to exceed four
pounds, or four pounds and a half. In fummer, the diet may be fix pounds and
a half, which may be carried off without the help of exercife, when the air is hot
and dry* If the quantity of food be fuch as to make the perfpiratien and urine of
a natural day always nearly equal, and the morning weight of the body always
nearly the fame, that quantity is the truly healthful quantity of food for grown.
No. 11. Tt bodies
162 A KEY TO PHYSIC
bodies which ufe but little exercife. The quantity of food neceffary to keep a
grown body in health, will be better and more eafily digefted, when it is fo divided
as to make the meals equal, than when they are very unequal. The diftance be-
tween one meal and another Ihould bear fome proportion to the largenefs of the pre-
ceding meal. Good and conftant health confifts in a jull quantity of food, and a
juft proportion of the meat to the drink; and, in order to be freed from chronical
disorders contradted by intemperance, the quantity of food ought to be leffeued,
and the proportion of the meat to the drink increafed, more or lefs, according to
the greatnefs of the diforders ;
and both the quantity of food, and the proportion
of meat to the drink, ought to be fuch as fhall make perfpiration and urine nearly
equal at all feafons of the year.
The quantity of animal food confumed by the Englifh is generally pernicious,
becaufe it produces but little of that air which is antifeptic: hence they are fubje6t
to the fcurvy, and its numerous train of confequences, indigeftion, low fpirits,
bypochondriacifm, &c. whereas, if vegetables and milk, whofe antifeptic quality,
arifing from the gas or air which they plentifully afford, were more ufed as food,
we fhould have lefs fcurvy, and likewife few'er putrid and inflammatory fevers.
One great reafon why leproftes, hot fcurvies, dyfenteries, plagues, peftilential
fevers, and the like diftempers, formerly fo frequent in London, are now fo rare,
is the change that has been made in the food of the inhabitants. Hopped beer,
and wine, coming into general ufe, have been a great means of fupprefling putrid
difeafes; greens and fruit are likewife more univerfally eaten, and falted meats
make a much lefs part of our food than formerly: to which may be added the more
general confumption of tea and fugar.
Vegetable food is moft proper for fcorbutic and hedlical perfons, and does very
well with people who have much exercife; but in other circumftances, a mixed diet
of vegetable and animal fubftances, fuch as is commonly ufed, feems beft calculated
to nourifh and preferve the body from decay.
The fofter and milder kinds of aliment are proper for children, and for youth the
ftronger. Old people ought to leffen the quantity of their food, and increafe that
of their drink: but yet fome allowance is to be made for cuftom, efpecially in
cold climates; for, as in thefe the appetite is keener, fo is the digeftion ftronger and
better performed.
Different fexes alfo require a different food and regimen. Women are weaker
than men, and for that reafon require a food and regimen peculiar to themfelves
;
they are of a fpungy and lax habit, and for the moft part addidted to indolence and
pleafure, drink little, have bodies of a highly delicate and fenfible nature, much
inclined to fpafms and convulfive motions, and difpofed to generate a redundance
of
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. lfiS
of blood. Befides, at certain ftated times they have a regular evacuation by the
veins of the uterus; and in confequences of thefe circumftances it is neceffary that
\vomen, rather than men, fhould obferve a regimen and method of living peculiarly
and accurately adapted to their habit and conftitution.
Hence it is obvious, that the phyfician a6is a prepofterous and unaccountable
part who to every one prefcribes the fame method of living; or thinks, that what
contributes to the health of one will without diftin<5tion or referve prove falutary to
all. For we are fufficiently taught by daily experience, that all fubftances are not
equally adapted to all patients; and that what one may bear without being fenfible
of any bad effedts, may to another prove prejudicial, and even fatal. Time itfelf
has a confiderable influence in determining the falutary or noxious effedls of ali-
ments; fince fome fubftances may fafely, and without any bad confequence, be
uled at one feafon, which at another may contribute not a little to the deftrudiion
of health.
As to the effedis of food on the mind, it is plain, that delicacy of feeling, live-
linefs of imagination, quicknefs of apprehenfion, and acutenefs of judgment, very
frequently accompany a weak ftate of the body. True it is, indeed, that the fame
ftate is liable to timidity, fluctuation, and doubt; while the ftrong have that fteadir
nefs of judgment, and firmnefs of purpofe, which are proper for the higher and
more adlive fcenes of life. The moft valuable ftate of the mind, however, ap-
pears to refide in fomewhat lefs firmnefs and vigour of body. Vegetable aliment,
as never over-diftending the vqflels or loading the fyftem, never interrupts the
ftronger motions of the mind ;
while the heat, fulnefs, and weight, of animal food,
are an enemy to its vigorous efforts. Temperance, then, does not fo much confift
in the quantity, for that always will be regulated by our appetite, as in the quality,
viz. a large proportion of vegetable aliment.
Of AIR.
IT is no eafy talk to afcertain the nature and origin of air, as being a fluid im-
perceptible to all our fenfes, except that of feeling. Indeed, from the refiftance
and impreffion it makes, we know that there is fuch a body, which every-where
furrounds our earth, and is of the utmoft importance, not only to mankind, in pro-
moting many ufeful arts, but abfolutely neceffary for the prefervation of health
and life.
The wholefomenefs or unwholefomenefs of air is certainly owing to the differ^
ent effluvia with w’hich it abounds, and ought to be particularly attended to by the
valetudinarian. The beft air is to be met with in open champaign countries ;
where the foil is dry, not parched or fandy, and fpontaneoufly produces wild
4 thyme,
164 A KEY TO PHYSIC
thyme, wild marjoram, and the like fweet-fcented plants. That near rivers is
rather prejudicial, unlefs they are fmall, clear, and have a gravelly channel. The
morning air is deemed more refrefiring than that of the evening, and air agitated
with breezes than that which is ferene and ftill. As good air contributes greatly
to health, fo that which is bad is no lets prejudicial to it. Stagnating air is pro-
ductive of putrid and malignant disorders, a3 dyfenteries, bilious fevers, &c. and
that which is too moift, of inflammatory ones, as coughs, rheumatifins, &c.
Moift and rainy feafons, however, differ widely in this refpe6t; fince, in marfliy
countries, intenfe and continued heats occafion the greatefl moifture in the air
:
whereas frequent fliowers, during the hot feafon, cool it, check the excels of va-
pour, dilute and refrefh the corrupted ftagnating w ater, and precipitate all noxious
and putrid effluvia.
To the preffure of air we are to attribute the coherence of the parts of bodies.
Breathing too, on w'hich depends animal life, is owing to the preffure and fpring
of the air; and to the fame caufe may be attributed the production of fire and
flame, as appears from the fudden extinction of a coal or candle in the exhaufted
receiver. It is likewife neceffary for the exiftence and preparation of founds, for
the germination and growth of plants, for conveying all the variety of fmells, and
for tranfmitting the rays and influence of the celeftial bodies. In fliort, fuch is the
generating and vivifying power of air, that fome of the ancient philofophers confi-
dered it as the firft principle of all things. Air not only aCts upon all bodies by its
common properties of weight and elafticity, but by the peculiar virtues of the in-
gredients whereof it is compofed. By means of a corroding acid, it diffolves iron
and copper, unlefs well defended by oil. Even gold, in the chemift’s laboratory,
when the air is impregnated with the effluvia of aqua regia, contracts a ruff like
other bodies. It fixes volatile bodies, and volatilizes thofe which are fixed. From
the different effluvia, diffufed through the air, proceed a variety of effeCts. Near
mines of copper, it will difcolour filver and brafs; and in London, the air of
which abounds with acid and corrofive particles, metalline utenfils ruff fooner than
in the country. It is very difficult to obtain oil of fulphur in a clear dry air, as its
parts are then more ready to evaporate; whereas in a moift cloudy air it may be
obtained in abundance. All falts melt moft readily in cloudy weather; and fepa-
rations fucceed belt in the fame ftate of the air. If pure wine be carried into a place
where the air is full of the fumes of wine then fermenting, it will begin to ferment
afrefh.
Wherever air ftagnates long, it becomes unwholefome. Hence the unhappy
perfons confined in gaols not only contract malignant fevers themfelves, but often
communicate them to others. Nor are many of the holes, for we cannot call them
houfes,
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 165
houfes, pofteffed by the poor in great towns, much better than gaols. Thefe low
dirty habitations are the very lurking-places of bad air and contagious difeafes.
Such as live in them feidom enjoy good health; and their children commonly die
young. In the choice of a houfe, thofe who have it in their power ought always to
pay the greateft attention to open free air. The various methods which luxury has
invented to make houfes clofe and warm, contribute not a little to render them un-
wholefome. No houfe can be wholefome unlefs the air has a free paffage through
it. For which reafon houfes ought daily to be ventilated, by opening oppofite
windows, and admitting a current of frefh air into every room. Beds, inftead of
being made up as foon as people rife out of them, ought to be turned down, and
expofed to the frefh air from the open windows through the day. This would expel
any noxious vapour, and could not fail to promote the health of the inhabitants.
In hofpitals, gaols, fhips, &c. where that cannot be conveniently done, ventilator*
Ihould be uled. The method of expelling foul, and introducing frefh, air, by
means of ventilators, is a moft falutary invention, and is indeed the mofl ufeful of
all our modern medical improvements. It is capable of univerfal application, and
is fraught with numerous advantages, both to thofe in health and in ficknefs. In all
places where numbers of people are crowded together, ventilation becomes abfo-
lutely neceffary. Air which flagnates in mines, wells, cellars, &c. is extremely
noxious. That kind of air is to be avoided as the moft deadly poifon. It often
kills almoft as quickly as lightning. For this reafon, people fhould be very cautious
in opening cellars that have been long fhut, or going down into deep wells, or pits,
efpecially if they have been kept clofe covered. We have daily accounts of per-
forms who lofe their lives by going down into deep wells and other places where the
air ftagnates. All thefe accidents might be prevented by only letting down a lighted
candle before them, and flopping when they perceive it go out : yet this precaution,
Ample as it is, is feidom ufed.
If frefh air be neceffary for thofe in health, it is ftill more fo for the lick, who
often lofe their lives for want of it. The notion that fick people rnuft be kept very
hot, is fo common, that one can hardly enter the chamber where a patient lies, with-
out being ready to faint, by reafon of the hot fuffocating fmell. How this muft af-
fect the fick any one may judge. No medicine is fo beneficial to the fick as frefh
air. It is the moft reviving of all cordials, if it be adminiftered with prudence. We
are not, however, to throw open doors and windows at random upon the fick. Frefh
air is to be let into the chamber gradually, and, if pofftble, by opening the windows
of fome other apartment.
There are many kinds of air, produced by accidental or artificial caufes, of which
the following are the moft material
:
No. 11. U u Dephlogijiicated,
160 A KEY TO PHYSIC
Dephlogifticated air, the oxygenous gas, or vital air, of the new chemiftry, is an
elaftic fluid naturally extricated in the procefs of vegetation; but artificially pro-
cured from nitre, minium, magnefia, water, &c. This is eminently capable of fup-
porting flame and animal life, and is one of the component parts o'f our atmofphere.
Plilogijticatedair, or azotic gas, is produced in great quantities during putrefadlion
and fermentation; and is alfo obtained in the calcination of metals and other phlo-
giflic procelfes. It deftroys animal life, and extinguiihes flame; but is very friendly
to vegetation, and is another of the component parts of our atmofphere.
Fixed air,
or carbonic acid gas, derives its name from the property of adhering to
certain bodies, and fixing itfelf in them. It confifts of dephlogifticated air united to
charcoal; this is obtained by fermentation, and in all phlogiftic procelfes, and mani-
fefts the properties of an acid. It extinguishes flame, and deftroys animal life.
Inflammable air, (hydrogenous gas,) confifts wholly of charcoal and water rarefied
by heat; and is remarkable for being the lighted of all gravitating fubftances. It is
produced naturally from all putrid waters, and may be artificially procured from cer-
tain metallic Solutions, by palling the fleam of water over red-hot iron, and by didd-
ling wood, pit-coal, &c. with a ftrong heat, or by oppofing charcoal to the heat of a
burning lens in vacuo. It extinguiihes flame, unlefs it be mixed with a certain pro-
portion of atmofpherical, or dephlogifticated, air; in which cafe, it explodes vio-
lently. It deftroys animal life, but is friendly to vegetation.
Nitrous air, or nitrous gas, is procured artificially by diflblving metallic or other
fubftances in nitrous acid. Being mixed with dephlogifticated air, both the fluids
lofe their elafticity, and a fmall quantity of nitrous acid is produced. It inftantly
kills animals and extinguiihes flame. By union with fome metals it is converted
into volatile alkali. In fome cafes it may be made to fupport flame, and even ani-
mal life. Its property of condenfing with dephlogifticated air, renders it a teft of
the Salubrity of the atmofphere.
Marine acid air, the muriatic acid gas of the new chemiftry, is the fame as marine
acid reduced into vapour, and deprived of moll of its waters.
Dephlogifticated marine acid air, or oxygenated muriatic acid gas, is fuppofed by
fome to be the marine acid deprived of its phlogifton; by others, to be the fame acid
with an addition of pure air. It deftroys many kinds of colours, and, with inflam-
mable air, regenerates common marine acid.
Alkaline air,
or ammoniacal gas, is the fame with pure volatile alkali, and is form-
ed by an union of phlogifticated and inflammable air.
Hepatic air, or Sulphureous acid gas, is produced from the decomposition of liver
of fulphur by acids; and in the common atmofphere it is inflammable, but does not
burn with explofion.
Atmofpherical
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 167.
Atmofphcrical air, is compofed ofdephlogifticated and phlogifticated air, and thus
fupports and fuftains both animal life and vegetation.
The exterior part of our habitable world is the air or atinofphere, a fpringy
body, that encompaffes the folid earth on all fides, and is near a thoufand times
lighter than water; and the higher it is, the lefs it is compreffed by the fuperior
incumbent air; and fo confequently, .
it being a fpringy body, the thinner it is.
And, as a pillar of air of any diameter is equal in weight to a pillar of quickfilver
of the fame diameter of between twenty-nine and thirty inches high, we may
infer that the top of the atmofphere is not very near the furface of the folid earth-
Now, as quickfilver is near fourteen times heavier than water, the atmofphere will
fuflain a column of water about fourteen times higher than the column of quick-
filver, that is, about thirty-four feet; and, if we confider that air is a thoufand times
lighter than water, then a pillar of air, equal in weight to a pillar of quickfilver of
thirty inches high, will be thirty-four thoufand feet; whereby we come
to know, that the air or atmofphere is at leafl 34,000 feet, that is, about fix
miles, high, but probably much more. And if we confider that the air is a
fpringy body, and that that which is neareft the earth is compreffed by the
weight of all the atmofphere above it, we fliall find that the air near the furface
of the earth is much deafer and thicker than it is in the upper regions. On this
theory it may be accounted for why great cities are not fo healthful to refide in as
fmall towns and country villages; and why London is much more prejudicial to
health, owing to the many works containing noxious effluvia poffeffed of the com*
ponent parts mentioned in the different kinds of air, and confequently forms an air
to breathe in that is not congenial to the life of Man.
Of EXERCISE.
EXERCISE may be faid to be either active or paffive. The a&ive is walking
hunting, dancing, playing at bowls, and the like; as alfo fpeaking, and other
labour of the body and mind. The paffive is riding in a coach, on horfeback or
in any other manner. Exercife may be continued to a beginning of wearinefs
and ought to be ufed before dinner in a pure light air; for which reafon, journeys,
and going into the country, contribute greatly to preferve and re-eftablifh health.
Exercife increafes the circulation of the blood, attenuates and divides the fluids,
and promotes a regular perfpiration, as w’ellas a due fecretion of all the’ humours;
for it accelerates the animal fpirits, and facilitates their diftribution into all the fibres
of the body, ftrengthens the parts, creates an appetite, and helps digeftion. Whence
it arifes, that thofe who accuftom themfelves to exercife are generally very robuft,
and feldoui fubjeft to difeafes.
Boerhaave
158 A KEY TO PHYSIC
Boerhaave recommends bodily exercife in difeafes of a weak and lax fibre. By
riding on horfeback, the pendulous vifeera of the abdomen are fhaken every mo-
ment, and gently rubbed as it were one againft another, while in the mean time
the pure air aCts on the lungs with greater force. But it is to be obferved, that a
weak man fhould not ride with a full ftomach, but either before dinner or after
the digeftion is near finiflied; for, when the ftomach is diftended, weak people do
not bear thefe concu'ffions of the horfe without difficulty; but, when the primce vise
are near empty, the remaining fasces are difcharged by this concuffion. Sailing in
a fhip is alfo an exercife of great ufe to weak people. If the veffel moves with an
even motion, by increafmg perfpiration it ufually excites a wonderful alacrity,
creates an appetite, and promotes digeftion. Thefe exercifes are more, efpecially
ferviceable to weak people; but, in order to ftrengthen the body by mufcular mo-
tion, running and bodily exercifes are to be ufed. In thefe we ftiould begin
with the moft gentle, fuch as walking, and increafe it by degrees till we come to
running. Thofe exercifes of the body are more efpecially ferviceable which give
delight to the mind at the fame time, as tennis, fencing, &c. for which reafon,
the wifdom of antiquity appointed rewards for thofe who excelled in thefe gym-
naftic exercifes, that by this means the bodies of their youth might be hardened for
warlike toils.
As nothing is more conducive to health than moderate exercife, fo violent exer-
cife diffi pates the fpirits, weakens the body, deftroys the elafticity of the fibres,
and exhaufts the fluid parts of the blood. No wonder, then, that acute and mor-
tal fevers often arife from too violent exercife of the body ;
for the motion of the
venous blood towards the heart being quickened by the contraction of the mufcles,
and the veins being thus depleted, the arteries more eafily propel their contained
humours through the fmalleft extremities into the now lefs-refifting veins ;
and
therefore the velocity of the circulation will be increafed through all the velfels.
But this cannot be performed without applying the humours oftener, or in a
greater quantity, to the fecretory organs in the fame time, whence the more fluid
parts of the blood will be difiipated, and what remains will be infpiffated; and, by
the greater aClion of the veffels upon their contained fluids, and of the re-a&ing
fluids upon the veffels, the blood acquires an inflammatory denfity. Add to this,
that by the violent attrition of the folids and fluids, together with the heat thence
arifing, all the humours will incline to a greater acrimony, and the falts and oils
of the blood will become more acrid and volatile. Hence thofe fevers which arife
from too much exercife or motion, are cured by the reft of body and mind, with fuch
aliments and medicines as moiften, dilute, and foften or allay acrimoay.
The exercife of afoldier in camp, confidered as conducive to health, Dr. Pringle
diftinguilhes into three heads ;
the firft relating to his duty, the fecond to his
4 . living

living more commociioufly, and the third to his diverfions. The firft, confifting
chiefly in the exercife of his arms, will be no lefs the means of preferving health than
of making him expert in his duty: and frequent returns of this, early, and before
the fun grows hot, will be more advantageous than repeating it feldom, and
flaying out long at a time,* for, a camp affording little convenience for refrefliment,
all unneceffary fatigue is to be avoided. As to the fecond article, cutting boughs
for fhading the tents, making trenches round them for carrying off the water, airing
the draw, cleaning their clothes and accoutrements, and affifting in the bufinefs of
the mefs, ought to be no difagreeable exercife to the men for fome part of the day.
Laftly, as to diverfions, the men muft be encouraged to them either by the example
of their officers, or by fmall premiums to thole who fliall excel in fuch kind of fports
as fliall be judged molt conducive to health : but herein great caution is neceffary,
not to allow them to fatigue themfelves too much, efpecially in hot weather or fickly
times ;
but above all, that their clothes be kept dry, wet clothes being frequent caufes
of difeafes and death.
Exercife, above all, is peculiarly neceffary to the philofopher, the ftudent, and
young gentlemen at fchool. How ufeful, how agreeable foever, ftudy may be to
the mind, it is very far from being equally falutary to the body. Every one ob-
ferves, that the Creator has formed an intimate connection between the body and
the mind; a perpetual aCtion and re-aCtion, by which the body inftantly feels the
diforders of the mind, and the mind thofe of the body. The delicate fprings of
our frail machines lofe their activity and become enervated, and the veffels are
choaked by obfiruC^ions, when we totally defifl from exercife ;
and the confequences
neceffarily aflfeCt the brain: a life entirely ftudious and fedentary is therefore
equally prejudicial to body and mind. The limbs likewife become ftiff ;
we con-
tract an aukward conftrained manner; a certaffi difguftful air attends all our
aCtions, and we are very near being as difagreeable to ourfelves as to others. An
inclination to ftudy is highly commendable; but it ought not, however, to in-
fpire us wit-h an averfion to fociety. The natural lot of man is to live among his
fellows: and, whatever may be the condition of our birth or our fituation in life,
there area thoufand occafions where a man muft naturally defire to render himfelf
agreeable; to be aCtive and adroit; to dance with a grace; to command the fiery
{teed; to defend himfelf againft a brutal enemy ;
to preferve his life by dexterity,
as by leaping, fwimming, &c. Many rational caufes have therefore given rife
to the practice of particular exercifes; and the moft fagacious and benevolent le-
giflators have infiituted, in their academies and univerfities, proper methods of
enabling youth, who devote themfelves to ftudy, to become expert alfo in laudable
athletic exercifes.
No. 11. X x Whoever
170 A KEY TO PHYSIC
Whoever confiders the ftruCture of the human body will foon be convinced of
the neceffity of exercife for the health of children. The body is compofed of an
infinite number of veffels, whofe fluids cannot be puthed on without the aCtion
and preffure of the mufcles. But, if the fluids remain inactive, obftru&ions muft
happen, and the humours will, of courfe, be vitiated, which cannot fail to occafion
difeafes. Nature has furnifhed both the veffels which carry the blood and lymph
with numerous valves; in order that the action of every mufcle might pulh for-
ward their contents; but, without aCtion, this admirable contrivance can have no
effect. This part of the animal oeconomy proves to a demonftration the neceffity
of exercife for the prefervation of health. Without exercife, the circulation of the
blood cannot be properly carried on, nor the different fecretions duly performed
;
without exercife, the humours cannot be properly prepared, nor the folids rendered
ftrong or firm. The aCtion of the heart, the motion of the lungs, and all the
vital functions, are greatly affifted by exercife. But to point out the manner in
which thefe effeCts are produced, would lead us farther into the oeconomy of the
human body than inoft of thofe for whom this treatife is intended would be able
to follow. We fhall therefore only add, that, where exercife is negleCted, none
of the animal functions can be duly performed; and, when that is the cafe, the whole
conftitution muff go to wreck.
The love of activity fliows itfelf very early in man. So ftrong is this principle,
that a healthy youth cannot be reftrained from exercife, even by the fear of punilh-
ment. Our love of motion is furely a ftrong proof of its utility. Nature implants
no difpofition in vain. It feems to be a catholic law throughout the whole animal
creation, that no creature, without exercife, fhould enjoy health, or be able to find
fubfiftence. Every creature, except man, takes as much of it as is neceffary. He
alone, and fuch animals as are under his direction, deviate from this original law;
and they fuffer accordingly. Inactivity never fails to induce an univerfal relaxa-
tion of the folids, which difpofes the body to innumerable difeafes. When the
folids are relaxed, neither the digeftion nor any of the fecretions can be duly per-
formed. In this cafe, the worft confequences muft enfue. How can perfons who
loll all day in eafy chairs, and fleep all night on beds of down, fail to be relaxed ?
Nor do fuch greatly mend the matter, who never ftir abroad but in a coach, fedan*
or fuch like. Thefe elegant pieces of luxury are become fo common, that the in-
habitants of great towns feem to be in fotne danger of loftng the ufe of their limbs
altogether. It is now below any one to walk, who can afford to be carried. How
ridiculous would it feem, to a perfon unacquainted, with modern luxury, to behold
the young and healthy fwinging along on the flioulders of their fellow-creatures !
or to fee a fat carcafe, over-run with difeafes occafioned by inactivity, dragged
through the ftreets by half a dozen horfes
!
G Glandular
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 171
Glandular obftru dtions, now fo common, generally proceed from inactivity.
Thefe are the moll obftinate of maladies. So long as the liver, kidneys, and other
glands, duly perform their functions, health is feldom impaired; but, when they
fail', nothing can reftore it. Exercife is almoft the only cure we know for glan-
dular obftru Ctions; indeed, it does not always fucceed as a remedy,- but there is
reafon to believe that it would feldom fail to prevent thefe complaints, were it
ufed in due time. One thing is certain, that, amongft thofe who take fufficient
exercife, glandular difeafes are very little known ; whereas the indolent and
inaCtive are feldom free from them. Weak nerves are the conftant companions of
inactivity. Nothing but exercife and open air can brace and ftrengthen the nerves,
or prevent the endlefs train of difeafes which proceed from a relaxed Hate of thefe
organs. We feldom hear the aCtive or laborious complain of nervous difeafes;
thefe arereferved for thefonsof eafe and affluence. Many have been completely
cured of thefe diforders by being reduced from a ftate of opulence to labour for
their daily bread. This plainly points out the fources from whence nervous dif-
eafes flow, and the means by which they may be prevented. It is abfolutely itn-
poffible to enjoy health, where the perfpiration is not duly carried on; but that
can never be the cafe where exercife is negleCied. When the matter which ought
to be thrown off by perfpiration is retained in the body, it vitiates the humours,
and occaflons the gout, fevers, rheumatifm, See. Exercife alone would prevent
many of thofe difeafes which cannot be cured, and would remove, others where
medicine proves ineffectual.
No piece of indolence hurts the health more than the modern cuftom of lying
a-bed too long in a morning. This is the general practice in great towns. The
inhabitants of cities feldom rife before nine or ten o’clock; but the morning is
undoubtedly the beft time for exercife, while the ftomach is empty, and the body
refrellied with fleep.. Befides, the morning air braces and ftrengthens the nerves,
and, in fome meafure, anfwers the purpofe of a cold bath. Let any one who has
been accuftomed to lie a-bed late, rife by fix or feven, fpend a couple of hours in
walking, riding, or any aCtive diverfion without doors, and he will find his fpirits
cheerful and ferene through the day, his appetite keen, and his body braced and
ftrengthened. Cuftom foon renders early rifing agreeable, and nothing contributes
more to the prefervation of health. The inaCtive are continually complaining of
pains of the ftomach, flatulencies, indigeftions. See. Thefe complaints, which
pave the way to many others, are not to be removed by medicine : they can
only be cured by a vigorous courfe of exercife, to which, they feldom fail to
yield.
Exercife, if poflible, ought always to be taken in the open air. When that
cannot be done, various methods may be contrived for exercifing the body within
doors*.
172 A KEY TO PHYSIC
doors. It is not neceffary to adhere ftridtly to any particular kind of exercife. The
beft way is to take them by turns, and to ufe that longeft which is aioft fuitable to
the ftrength and conflitution. Thofe kinds of exercife which give adlion to raoft
of the bodily organs, are always to be preferred, as walking, running, riding, digging,
fwimming, and fuch like. It is much to be regretted, that a6tive and manly diver-
fions are now fo little pradlifed. Diverfions make people take more exercife than
they otherwife would do, and are of the greateft fervice to fuch as are not under the
neceffity of labouring for their bread. As aftive diverfions lofe ground, thofe of a
fedentary kind feem to prevail. Sedentary diverfions are of no other ufe but to
confume time. Inftead of relieving the mind, they often require more thought than
either ftudy or bufinefs. Every thing that induces people to fit ftill, unlefs it be.
fome necefiary employment, ought to be avoided.
The diverfions which afford the beft exercife are hunting, fhooting, playing at
cricket, bowls, &c. Thefe exercife the limbs, promote perfpiration, and the other
fecretions. They likewife ftrengthen the lungs, and give firmnefs and agility to the
whole body. Such as can, ought to fpend two or three hours a-day on horfeback
;
thofe who cannot ride, fliould employ the fame time in walking. Exercife fiiould
never be continued too long. Over-fatigue prevents the benefit of exercife, and
inftead of ftrengthening the body tends to weaken it. Every man fliould lay himfelf
under fome fort of neceffity to take exercife. Indolence, like other vices, when in-
dulged, gains ground, and at length becomes agreeable. Hence many who were
fond of exercife in the early part of life, become quite averfe from it afterwards.
This is the cafe of moft hypochondriac and gouty people, which renders their dif-
eafes in a great meafure incurable. Indolence not only occafions difeafes, and
renders men ufelefs to fociety, but promotes all manner of vice. To fay a man is
lazy, is little better than calling him vicious. The mind, if not engaged in fome
ufeful purfuit, is conftantly in queft of ideal pleafures, or impreffed with the ap-.
prehenfton of fome imaginary evil. From thefe fources proceed moft of the miferies
of mankind. Certainly man was never intended to be idle, lnadlivity fruftrates
the very defign of his creation : whereas an active life is the beft guardian of virtue,
and the greateft prefervative of health.
Of SLEEP.
SLEEP, as well as food, ought to be duly regulated. Too little fleep weakens
the nerves, exhaufts the fpirits, and occafions difeafes; and too much renders the
mind dull, the body grofs, and difpofes to apoplexies, lethargies, and other com-
plaints of a fimilar nature. A medium ought therefore to be obferved ; but this
is not eafy to fix. Children require more fleep than grown perfons, the laborious
than
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 173
than the idle, and fuch as eat and drink freely than thole who live abftemioufly.
Befides, the real quantity of fleep cannot be meafured by time ; as. one perfon will
bje more refrethed by five or fix hours deep than another by eight or ten. Chil-
dren may always be allowed to take as much fleep as they plcale, but, foi adults,
fix or feven hours is certainly fufficient, and no one ought to exceed eight. Thole
who lie aT bed more than eight hours may (lumber, but they can be hardly faid to
deep; luch generally tofs and dream away the forepart of the night, fink to reft
towards morning, and doze till noon. The belt way to make fleep found and re-
freftiing is to rife betimes. The cufiom of lying a-bed for nine or ten hours,' not
only makes the fleep lefs refreflnng, but weakens the conftitution. Nature points
out night as the proper feafon for fleep. Nothing more certainly deftroys the con-
ftitution than night-watching. It is a great pity that a practice fo deftructive to
health fhould be fo much in fafhion. How quickly the want of reft in due feafon
will blaft the moft blooming complexion, or ruin the beft conftitution, is evident
from the ghaftly countenances of thole who, as the phrafe is, turn day into night,
and night into day. To make fleep refreflnng, the following things are requifite
.
Firft, to take fufficient exercife in the open air ;
to avoid ftrong tea or coffee ; next,
to eat a light (upper ;
and laftly, to lie down with a mind as cheerful and ferene
as poflible.
It is certain that too much exercife will prevent fleep as well as too little. We
feldom, however, hear the active and laborious complain of reftlefs nights. It is
the indolent and flothful who generally have thefe complaints. Is it any wonder
that a bed of down fliould not be refreftiing to a perfon who fits all day in an eafy
chair? A great part of the pleafure of life confifts in alternate reft and motion;
but they who neglect the latter can never relifli the former. The labourer enjoys
more true luxury in plain food and found fleep, than is to be found in fumptuous
tables and downy pillows, where exercife is wanting. That light fuppers caufe
(bund fleep, is true even to a proverb. Many perfons, if they exceed theleaftat
that meal, are lure to have uneafy nights ;
and, if they fall afleep, the load and
oppreflion on their ftomach and fpirits occafion frightful dreams, broken and
difturbed repofe, the night-mare, &c. Were the fame perfons to go to bed with
a light lupper, or fit up till that meal was pretty well digefted, they would enjoy
found fleep, and rife refrelhed and cheerful. There are indeed fome people who
cannot fleep unlefs they have fome lolid food at night, but this does not imply
the neceffity of a heavy fupper.
Nothing more certainly difturbs our repofe than anxiety. When the mind is
not at eafe, one feldom enjoys found fleep. That greateft of human bleflings flies
the wretched, and vifits the happy, the cheerful, and the gay. This is a fufficient

reafon why every man fliould endeavour to be as esfy in his mind as poffiblb when
he goes to reft. IV Iany, by indulging grief and anxious thought, have baniihed
found ileep fo long, that they could never afterwards enjoy it. Sleep, when taken
in the fore part of the night, is generally reckoned moft refrelhing. Whether this
be the effect of habit or not is hard to fay; but, as moft people are accuftomed
to go early to bed when young, it may be prefumed that deep, at this feafon, will
prove moft refrelhing to them ever after. Whether the fore part of the night be
bed for deep or not, furely the forepart of the day is fitted both for bufmefs and
amufement ;
and we hardly ever find an early rifer who does not enjoy a good date
of health. . '

Experience proves that, the more a perfon deeps, the more he is inclined to deep
;
if in the morning we deep an hour beyond our cuftom, the confeqnence is, that
we diall be dull and heavy all the day; and, as to thefe facts, there are fome very-
remarkable. —A youth in Germany, of immenfe wealth, was fummoned by his
prince to take up a title of nobility; on which occafion he drank to fuch an excels,
that the prince, in order to cure him of fuch a fcandalous vice, had him carried
into a dark and remote place, where he dept three days and three nights ;
for
whenever he awoke, believing it to be the middle of the night, he betook himfelf
to deep again. —The memoirs of the academy of fciences at Paris mention a deep
of two months, cauled by a catalepfy, a difeafe by which the patient is initantly
rendered as immoveable as a ftatue. —Samuel Chilton, a labourer, in Somerfetfhire,
fell, and without any vifible caufe, into a profound deep, out of which no means
could recover him, till after a month’s time, he arofe of himfelf. His mother,,
fearing he ihould be ftarved in that fallen humour, as die called it, put bread and
cheefe and fmall beer by him, and it was daily fipent. On the ninth' of April,
1 696,
he was feized with a like deepy fit, which iafted till the leventh of Anguft,
when lie awaked, without knowing be had dept above a night. Meoccafionally
ufed the food fet by him, and had evacuations, till, about the tenth week, his
jfaws feemed to be fet, and his teeth clinched fo dole that his “mouth could not be
opened ;
and all the nouridiment he received-, during thefe feven weeks, was about
three 'pints of tent infinuated through a cavity in one of his teeth. He had made
water but once, and never had a ftool all the time. On the 17th of Anguft, 1 697,
his fit returned, and Dr. Oliver, the author Of the memoir, in order to try whe-
ther there might not he fome impofture in this extraordinary phenomenon, went
to the houi’e ;
he put his mouth to his ear, and called him feveral times, by his
name, as loud as he could ;
pulled him by the fhoulders, pinched his nofe, flop-
ped his mouth and nofe at the fame time; lifted up his eye-lids, when he found

half-ounce bottle, and the fpirit, he lays, being drawn from quick lime, was almoft
as hot as fire itlelf. Not fatisfied with this, he. crammed the fame noftril with pow-
der of white hellebore: all thefe experiments producing no other effect, than to
make his eyes fliiver a little. Dr. Oliver left him, convinced that he •was really
afleep. A few days after, an apothecary drew fome ounces of blood from his arm,
and bound up the orifice, without his making the leaft motion : likewife, a gentle-
man, though fbriiewhat indifcreetly, ran a pin into his arm, up to the very bone
;
and in this ftate of infenfible fleep he continued till the nineteenth of November
;
during all this time he ate and evacuated, but never fouled his bed. The above
inftanee of fleep is to be feen at large in Jones’s Abridgement of the Philofophical
Tranl’acfions, vol. v.
Of DREAMS.
SCARCE any part of nature is lefs open to our obfervation than the human
mind in this ftate. The dreamer himfelf cannot well oblerve the manner in which
dreams arife or difappear to him. When he awakes, he cannot recollect the cir-
cumftances of his dreams with fufficient accuracy. Were we to watch over him
with the moft vigilant attention, we could not perceive with certainty what emotions
are excited in his mind, or what thoughts pafs through it, during his fleep. But
though we could afeertain thefe phenomena, many other difficulties would ftill re-
main. What parts of a human being are aCtive, what dormant, when he dreams ?
Why does he not always dream while afleep ? Or why dreams he at all ? Do any
circumftances in our conftitution, fttuation, and peculiar character, determine the
nature of our dreams ? We may lay before the reader l’uch facts as have been afeer-
tained concerning dreaming, and the moft plauftble conjectures that have been of-
fered to explain thofe particulars, about which we can only conjecture, or have at
leaft hitherto obtained nothing more certain than conjecture.
In dreaming, we are not confcious of being afleep. This is well known from a
thoufand circumftances. When awake, we often recolleCt our dreams ;
and we
remember on Inch occafions, that, while thofe dreams were palling through our
minds, it never occurred to us that we were feparated by fleep from the aCtive
world. We are often oblerved to aCt and talk in dreaming as if we were buftly
engaged in the intercourse of focial life. In dreaming, we do not conftder ourfelves
as witneffing or bearing a part in a fictitious feene : we feem not to be in a ftmilar
fituation with the aCtors in a dramatic performance, or the fpeCtators before whom
they exhibit, but engaged in the bufmefs of real life. All the varieties of thought
that pafs through our minds when awake may alfo occur in dreams; all the images
which
176 A KEY TO PHYSIC*
which imagination prefents in the former ftate die is alfo able to call up in the latter
;
all the fame emotions may be excited, and we are often actuated by equal violence
of paftion; none of the tranfafitions in which we are capable of engaging while
awake is impoffible in dreams: in fliort, our range of action and obfervation is
equally wide in one ftate as in the other; and, while dreaming, we are not fenfible
of any diftinclion between our dreams and the events and tranfaclions in which we
are actually concerned in our intercourfe with the world.
Though in dreams imagination appears to be free from all reftraint, and indulges
in the moft wr
anton freaks, yet it is generally agreed, that the imaginary tranfaCtions
of the dreamer bear always fome relation to his particular charader in the world,
his habits of action, and the circumftances of his life. The lover, we are told,
dreams of his miftrefs ;
the mifer of his money ;
the philofopher renews his re-
fearches in deep often with the fame pain and fatigue as when awake ;
and even
the merchant, at times, returns to balance his hooks, and compute the profits of
an adventure, when {lumbering on his pillow. And not only do the more general
circumftances of a perfon’s life influence his dreams; his paflions and habits are
nearly the fame when afleep as when awake. Aperfon whofs habits of life are vir-
tuous,
does not in his dreams plunge into aferies of crimes ; nor are the vicious
reformed when they pafs into this imaginary world. The choleric man finds him-
felf offended by flight provocations as well in his dreams as in his ordinary inter-
courfe with the world, and a mild temper continues pacific in deep. The charac-
ter of a perfon's dreams is influenced by his circumftances when awake in a ftill
more unaccountable manner. Certain dreams ufually arife in the mind after a pe'r-
fon has been in certain fituations. Dr. Beattie relates, that he once, after riding
thirty miles in a high wind, paffed a part of the fucceeding night in dreams beyond
defcription terrible. The ftate of a perfon’s health, and the manner in which the
vital funfitions are carried on, have a confiderable influence in determining the cha-
racter of dreams. After too full a meal, or after eating of an unufual fort of food,
a perfon has always dreams of a certain nature. In dreaming, the mind for the moft
part carries on no intercourfe through the lenfes with furrounding objects. Touch
'a perfon gently who is afleep, he feels not the impreffion. You may awake him
by a fmart blow; but, when the ftrokeis not fufficiently violent to awake him, he
remains infenfible of it. We lpeak foftly betide a perfon afleep without fearing
that he overhear us. His eye-lids are fliut; and, even though light thould fall upon
the eye-ball, yet ftill his powers of vifion are not awakened to afitive exertion,
unlels the light be fo ftrong as to roufe him from deep. He is infenfible both to
fweet and diiagreeable fmells. It is not eafy to try whether his organs of tafte retain
their activity, without awakening him ;
yet frpm analogy it may be prefumed
- 1 that
177

that thefe too are inactive. With refpefifc to the circumftances here enumerated, it
is indifferent whether a perfon be dreaming or buried in lleep.
Yet there is one remarkable fact concerning dreaming which may feem to contra-
dict what has been here alferted. In dreams, we are liable not only to fpeak aloud
in confequence of the fuggeftions of imagination, but even to get up, and walk
about and engage in little enterprifes, without awaking. Now, as we are in this
iultance fo aCtive, it feems that we cannot be then infenfible of the prefence of fur-
rounding objeCts. The flecp-walker is really fenfible, in a certain degree, of the pre-
fence of the objeCts around him ;
but he does not attend to them with all their cir-
cumftances, nor do they excite in him the fame emotions as if he were awake. He
feels no terror on the top of a houfe, or the brink of a precipice: and, in confe-
quence of being free from fear, he is alfo without danger in fuch a fituation, unlefs
luddenly awaked. This is one of the moft inexplicable phenomena of dreaming.
There is alfo another faCt not quite confonant with what has been above advanced.
It isfaid, that in deep a perfon will continue to hear the noife of a cataract in the
neighbourhood, or regular ftrokes with a hammer, or any fimilar found fufficiently
loud, and continued uninterruptedly from before the time of his falling afleep.
We know not whether he awakes on the fudden ceflation of the noife. This fact
is alferted on lufficient evidence : it is curious. Even when awake, if very deeply
intent on any piece of Itudy, or clofely occupied in bufinels, the found of a clock
ftriking in the neighbourhood, or the beating of a drum, will efcape us unnoticed
:
and it is therefore the more furprifing that we fhould thus continue fenfible to
founds when afleep. Not only do a perfon’s general character, habits of life, and
ftate of health, influence his dreams ; but thole concerns in which he has been
moft deeply interefted during the preceding day, and the views which have
arilen molt frequently to his imagination, very olten afford the lubjeCts of his
dreams. When I look forward with anxious expectation towards any future event,
I am likely to dream either of the difappointmentor the gratification of my willies.
Have I been engaged through the day, either in bufinefs or amufements which I
have found exceedingly agreeable, or in a way in which I have been extremely un-
happy, either my happinels or my milery is likely to be renewed in my dreams.
Though dreams have been regarded among almol't all nations through the world,
at leaft in fome periods of their hrftory, as prophetic of future events; yet it does
not appear that this popular opinion has been eftablilhed on good grounds. Chril-
tianity, indeed, teaches us to believe,* that the Supreme Being may, and actually
does, operate on our minds, and influence at times the determinations of our will,
without making us fenfible of the reftraint to which we are thus lubj acted. And,
in the fame manner, no doubt, the fuggeftions which arife to us in dreams may ba

produced. The imaginary tranfacfions in which we are then engaged, may be
fuch as are actually to occupy us in life; the ftrange and feemingly incoherent ap-
pearances which are then prefented to the mind’s eye, may allude to fome events
which are to befal ourfelves or others. It is, therefore, by no means impoffible,
or inconfiftent with the general analogy of nature, that dreams ihould have a refpecf
to futurity. We have no reafon to regard the dreams which are related in the Holy
Scriptures to have been prophetic of future events as not infpired by heaven, or
to laugh at the idea of a prophetic dream as abfurd or ridiculous.
M e know.of no other fadts that have been fully afcertained concerning dreaming.
But we are by no means lufficiently acquainted with this important phenomenon in
the hiftory of the mind. We cannot tell by what laws of our conftitution we are
thus liable to be fo frequently engaged in imaginary tranfadtions, nor what are the-
particular means by which the delulion is accompliihed. The delufion is indeed
remarkably ftrong. One will fometimes have a book prefented to him in a dream,
and fancy that he reads, and adtually enter into the nature of the compofition be-
fore him, and even remember, after he awakes, what he knows that he only
fancied himfelf reading. Can this be delufion? If delufion, how or for what
purpofes is it produced ? The mind, it w7
ould appear, does not, in deep, be-
come inadtive like the body ; 01 at leaft is not always inactive while we are afleep.
When we do not dream, the mind mull either be inadtive, or the connection be-
tween the mind and the body mult be confidered as in fome manner fufpended
:
and when we dream, the mind, though it probably adts in concert with the body,
yet does not adt in the fame manner as when we are awake. It leems to be clouded
or bewildered, in confequence of being deprived for a time of the fervice of the
fenfes. Imagination becomes more adtive and more capricious : and all the other
powers, efpecially judgment and memory, become difordered and irregular in.
their operation.
Various theories have been propofed to explain what appears here moft inexpli-
cable. The ingenious Mr. Baxter, in his treatife on the Immateriality of the Hu-
man Soul, endeavours to prove that dreams are produced by the agency of fome
fpiritual beings, who either amufe or employ themfelves ferioufly in engaging man-
kind in all thofe imaginary tranfa&ions with which they are employed in dreaming.
This theory, however, is far from being plaufible. It leads us entirely beyond
the limits of our knowdedge. It requires us to believe without evidence. It is
unfupported by any analogy. It creates difficulties ftill more inexplicable than
thofe which it has been propofed to remove. . Till it appear that our dreams can-
not poffibly be produced without the interference of other fpiritual agents, pof-
feffing luch influence over our minds as to deceive us with fancied joys, and involve
us
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 179
us in imaginary afflictions, we cannot reafonably refer them to fuch a caufc. Betides,
from the fadfs which have been ftated as well known concerning dreams, it appears
that their nature depends both on the ftate of the human body and on that of the
mind. But, were they owing to the agency of other fpiritual beings, how could they
be influenced by the ftate of the body ? Thofe muft be a curious let of fpiritual
beings who depend in fuch a manner on the ftate of our corporeal frame. Better not
to allow them exifteace at all, than to place them in fuch a dependance.
Wolfius, and after him M. Formey, have fuppofed, that dreams never arife in
the mind except in confequence of lome of the organs of fenfation having been
previoufly excited. Either the ear or the eye, or the organs of touching, tailing,
or fmelling, communicate information, fomehovv, in a tacit, fecret, manner; and
thus partly roufe its faculties from the lethargy in wfflich they are buried in fleep,
and engage them in a feries of confufed<and imperfedt exertions. But what paffes
in dreams is fo very different from all that wr
e do when awake, that it is impoffible
for the dreamer himlelf to diftinguifh whether his powers of fenfation perform any
part on the occafion. It is not neceffary that imagination be always excited by fen-
fation. Fancy, even when we are awake, often wanders from the prefent lcene.
Abfence of mind is incident to the ftudious ;
the poet and the mathematician many
times forget what they are. We cannot dilcover from any thing that a pcrfon in
dreaming difplays to the obfervation of others, that his organs of fenfation take a
part in the imaginary tranfadtions in which he is employed. In thofe inftances, in-
deed, in which perfons afleep are faid to hear founds ;
the founds which they hear
are laid all’o to influence, in lome manner, the nature of their dreams. But fuch
inftances are fingular. Since then it appears that the perfon who dreams is himfelf
incapable of diftinguilhing either during his dreams, or by recollection when awake,
whether any new impreffions are communicated to him in that ftate by his organs
of fenfation ;
that even by watching over him, and comparing our obfervations of
his circumftances and emotions, in his dreams, with what he recolledts of them after
awaking, we cannot, except in one or two fingular inftances, afcertain this fadt; and
that the mind is not incapable of adting while the organs of fenfation are at reft, and
on many occafions refufes to liften to the information which they convey; we may,
without hefitation, conclude, that the theory of Wolfius and Formey has been
too haftily and incautioufly advanced.
Other phyfiologilts tell us, that the mind, when we dream, is in a ftate of
delirium. Sleep, they fay, is attended with what is called a collapfe of the brain ;
during which either the whole or a part of the nerves of which it confifts, are in a
ftate in which they cannot carry on the ulual intercourfe between the mind and the
organs of fenfation. When the whole of the brain is in this itate, we become en-
180 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
tirely unconfcious of exiftence, and the mind finks into inactivity : when only a part
of the brain is collapfed, as they term it, we are then neither alleep nor awake, but
in a fort of delirium between the two. This theory, like the laft mentioned, fup-
pofes the mind incapable of acting without the help of fenfation: it fuppofes that
we know the nature of aftateof which we cannot afcertain the phenomena; it alfo
contradicts a known faCt, in reprefenting dreams as confufed images of things around
us, not fanciful combinations of things not exifting together in nature or in human
life. We mult treat it likewife, therefore, as a bafelels fabric.
Inftead of the attendant fpirits watching over our bodies, and inciting us to
good or evil in our dreams, may we not more rationally fuppofe, that thefe
incitements, or rather exertions towards real and lenfible aCtions, are produced
by the foul or fpirit within us, which, being mortal, never Deeps; but which
rather, during that paffive ftale of the body, aflumes an endeavour to aCt
without it, or to efcape from it, as from a prifon, wherein it is reftrained to
certain limits, and obliged to act under the will of its keeper. This furelv
will beft explain the faCts attending Deep-walkers, who, in the darkelt nights,
vifit different apartments, walk up and down ltairs, lock and unlock doors,
open windows, and crawl over the roofs of houfes, with the ulmoft eale and
celerity; which, if the persons were awake, would be impoflible. May we not
likewife attribute to the fame fource, thofe elevated ideas, and fublime com-
pofitions, which Milton and other celebrated authors have confefled, were
communicated nightly in their dreams?—It lately happened, that a young gen-
tleman, about fifteen years of age, from one of the public fchools, Dept in
the fame room with me. He chofe to go to bed early ;
and when I came into
the fame apartment, about two hours after, he appeared remarkably intent
upon his ftudies, though faft locked in the arms of Deep. I ftood fome time
at his bed-fide, and heard him repeat feveral lines from Homer and Virgil.
After this he repeated, with a bold and nervous accent, the whole of the He-
brew alphabet; then, turning, feerned to fall into a more compofed Deep.
The next morning at breakfaft I related this circumftance to the company, in
the prefence of the young gentleman ; and all were inftantly commending the
great progrefs he muft have made in his ftudies. The young man inftantly
declared, that, however converfant he might be with Virgil and Homer, he
had never heard the Hebrew' alphabet repeated, nor did he ever know the
name of any one of its characters. —The nature of the connection by which, the
foul and body are united, feems to be almoft beyond our comprehenfion ;
and,
till we can apply experiment and obfervation in a better manner to this branch of
1 phyfiology,
181
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES.
phyfiology, it muft undoubtedly remain unknown. To fomething myfterious in
the nature of that conneaion, the delufion produced in dreams is in all pro-
bability owing.
Amid this uncertainty with refpect to the manner in which our powers of mind
and body perform their functions in dreaming, it is pleafing to find that we can,
however, apply to ufeful purpofes the imperfect knowledge which we have been
able to acquire concerning the feries of phenomena. Our dreams are affected by
the ftate of our health, by the manner in which we have palled the preceding day,
by our general habits of life, by the hopes which we moft fondly indulge, and the
fears which prevail moft over our fortitude when we are awake. From recollecting
our dreams, therefore, we may learn to correct many improprieties in our conduct;
to refrain from bodily exercifes, or from meats and drinks, that have unfavor-
able effects on our conftitution ;
to refift in due time evil habits that are ftealing
upon us ;
and to guard againft hopes and fears which detach us from our proper
concerns, and unfit us for the duties of life. Inftead of thinking what our dreams
may forebode, we may, with much better reafon, reflect by what they have been
occafioned, and look back to thofe circumftances in our paft life to which they are
owing. The fleep of innocence and health is found and refrefhing; their dreams
delightful and pleafing. A diftempered body, and a polluted or perturbed mind,
are haunted in fleep with frightful, impure, and unpleafing, dreams.
Of INTEMPERANCE.
It is univerfally agreed, that temperance and exercife are the two beft phyfi-
cians in the world, and that, if thefe were duly regarded, there would be little oe-
cafion for any other. Temperance mayjujlly be called the parent of health ; yet
numbers of mankind a6t as if they thought difeafes and death too flow in their pro-
grefs, and, by intemperance and debauch, feem, as it were, to folicit their approach.
The danger of intemperance appears from the very conftrufition of the human body.
Health depends on the ftate of the folids and fluids which fits them for the due
performance of the vital, functions ;
and, while thefe go regularly on, we are
found and well ;
but whatever difturbs them neceffarily impairs health. Intem-
perance never fails to diforder the whole animal oeconomy ;
it hurts the digeftion,
relaxes the nerves, renders the different l'ecretions irregular, vitiates the humours,
and occafions numberlefs difeafes.
The.analogy between the nourifhment of plants and animals affords a ftriking
proof of the danger of intemperance. Moifture and manure greatly promote ve-
getation; yet an over-quantity of either will entirely deftroy it. The beft things
become hurtful, nay deftruclive, when carried to excefs. Hence we learn, that
No. 12. 3 A th&
182 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
the higheft degree of human wifdom confifts in regulating our appetites and paf-
fions I’o as to avoid all extremes. It is that chiefly which entitles us to the cha-
racter of rational beings. The Have of appetite will ever be the difgrace of human
nature. —The Supreme Being hath endued us with various paflions for the pro-
pagation of the fpecies, the prefervation of the individual, &c. Intemperance is
the abufe of thefe paflions ;
and moderation confifts in the proper regulation of
them. Men, not contented with fatisfying the Ample calls of Nature, create ar-
tificial wants, and are perpetually in fearch of fomething that may gratify them ;
but imaginary wants can never be gratified. Nature is content with little : but
luxury knows no bounds. Hence the epicure, the drunkard, and the debauchee,
leldom flop their career, till their money, or their conftitution, fails : then, indeed,
they generally fee their error when too late.
It is impoflible to lay down fixed rules with regard to diet, on account of the
different conftitutions of mankind. The moft ignorant perfon, however, certainly
knows what is meant by excefs ;
and it is in the power of every man, if he choofes,
to avoid it. The great rule of diet is to ftudy fimplicity. Nature delights in the
moft plain and Ample food ;
and every animal, except man, follows her dictates.
Man alone riots at large, and ranfacks the whole creation in queft of luxuries, to
liis own deftruCtion. An elegant writer of the laft age fpeaks thus of intemperance
in diet: “ For my part, when I behold a fafhionable table fet out in all its mag-
nificence, I fancy that I fee gouts and dropfies, fevers and lethargies, with other
innumerable diftempers, lying in ambufcade among the difhes.” Nor is intem-
perance in other things lefs deftructive than in diet.. How quickly does the im-
moderate purfuit of carnal pleafures, or the abufe of intoxicating liquors, ruin the
beft conftitution ! Indeed thefe vices generally go hand in hand. Hence it is that
we fo often behold the votaries of Bacchus and Venus, even before they have ar-
rived at the prime of life, worn out with difeafe, and hafting with l’wift pace to an
untimely grave. Did men reflect on the painful difeafes, and premature deaths,
which are daily occafioned by intemperance, it would be fufficient to make them
thrink back with horror from the indulgence even of their darling pleafures.
Intemperance does not hurt its votaries alone; the innocent too often feci the
direful effects of it. How often do we behold the miferable mother, with her
helplefs infants, pining in want, while the cruel father is indulging his infatiate
appetites? Families are not only reduced to mifery, but even extirpated, by in-
temperance. Nothing tendsJo much to prevent propagation,
and to Jhorten the
lives of children,
as the intemperance ofparents. The poor man who labours all
day, and at night lies down contented with his humble fare, can boaft a numerous
offspring; while his pampered lord, funk in eal'c and luxuiy, often languiflies
without
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 183
without an heir to his ample fortunes. Even ftates and empires feel the influence
of intemperance, and rife or fall as it prevails. Inltead of mentioning the different
kinds of intemperance, and pointing out their influence upon health, we ffiall only,
by way of example, make a few obfervations on one particular lpecies of that vice,
viz. the abufe of intoxicating liquors.
Every aSi of intoxication puts Nature to the expence of afever, in order to
dijcharge thepoifonous draught. When this is repeated almoft every day, it is eafy
to forefee the colifequences. That conftitution muft be ftrong indeed, which is able
long to hold out under a daily fever ! But fevers occafioned by drinking do not
always go off in a day; they frequently end in an infanimation of the breafi,
liver, or brain, and produce fatal effeSls. Though the drunkard ftiould not
fall by an acute difeafe, he feldom efcapes thofe of a chronic kind. Intoxica-
ting liquors, when ufed to excefs, weaken the bowels and fpoil the digeftion
;
they deftroy the power of the nerves, and occafion paralytic and convulflve dis-
orders : they likewife heat and inflame the blood, deltroy its balfamic quality,
render it unfit for circulation, and the nourifhment of the body. Hence ob-
ftru6tions, atrophies, dropfies, and confumptions of the lungs. Thefe are the
common ways in which drunkards make their exit.' Difeafes of this kind, when
brought on by hard drinking, feldom admit of a cure. Many people injure their
health by drinking,
whofeldom get drunk. The continual habit of foaking, as
it is called, though its effedts be not fo violent, is not lels pernicious. When the
vefiels are kept conftantly full and upon the ftretch, the different digeftions can
neither be duly performed, nor the humours properly prepared. Hence molt
people of this charadter are afflicted with the gout, the gravel, ulcerous fores in
the legs, &c. If thefe dilbrders do not appear, they are feized with low Spirits,
hypochondriacal affections, and other iymptoms of indigeftion.
Confumptions are now fo common, that it is thought one-tenth of the inhabitants
of great towns die of that difeafe. Hard drinking is no doubt one of the caufes to
which we muft impute the increafe of confumptions. The great quantities of vifcid
malt-liquor drunk by the common people of England cannot fail to render the
blood fizy and unfit for circulation ;
from whence proceed obftrufifions, and in-
flammations of the lungs. There are few great ale-drinkers who are not phthifical
.
nor is that to be wondered at, confidering the glutinous and almoft indigeftible
nature of ftrong ale. Thofe who drink ardent Spirits or ftrong wines run Still
greater hazard; thefe liquors heat and inflame the blood, and tear the tender
vefiels of the lungs in pieces ;
yet, fo great is the coniumption of them in this coun-
try, that one would almoft be induced to think the inhabitants lived upon them.
The habit of drinking proceeds frequently from misfortunes, in life. The mifiera-
We
184 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
ble fly to it for relief. It affords them indeed a temporary cafe. But, alas ! this
folace.is lliort-lived ;
and when it is over, the fpirits fink as much below their
ufual tone as they had before been raifed above it. Hence a repetition of the dofe
becomes necefiary, and every frefh dofe makes way for another, till the unhappy
wretch becomes a Have to the bottle, and at length falls a facrifice to what at fit It
perhaps was taken only as a medicine. No man is fo dejedted as the drunkard
when his debauch is gone off. Hence it is, that thofe who have the greateft flow
of fpirits while the glafs circulates freely, are of all others the moft melancholy
when fpber, and often put an end to their own miferable exiftence in a fit of
fpleen or ill humour.
Drunhennefs not only proves deftruElivc to health ,
but likewife to thefaculties
of the mind. It is ftrange that creatures who value themfelves on account of a
fuperior degree of reafou to that of brutes fhould take pleafure in finking fo far
below them. Were fuch as voluntarily deprive themfelves of the ufe of reafon
to continue ever after in that condition, it would f’eem but a juft punifliment.
Though this be not the confequence of one a£t of intoxication, it leldoin fails
to fucceed a courfe of it. By a habit of drinking, the greateft genius is often re-
duced to a mere idiot. Intoxication is peculiarly hurtful to young per
Jans. It
heats their blood, impairs their ftrength, and obftrudls their growth ;
belides, the
frequent ufe of ftrong liquors in the early part of life deftroys any benefit that
might arife from them afterwards. Thofe who make a praSlice of drinking ge-
nerous liquors when young, cannot expedl to reap any benefitfrom them as a cor-
dial in the decline of life. Drupkennefs is not only in itfelf a moft abominable
vice, but is an inducement to many others. There is hardly any crime fo horrid
that the drunkard will not perpetrate for the love of liquor. We have known mo-
thers fell their children’s clothes, the food that they Ihould have eaten, and after-
wards even the infants themfelves, in order to purchafe the accurfed draught
It is amazing that our improvements in arts, learning, and poli tenets', have not
put the barbarous cuftom of drinking to excels out of fafhion. It is indeed lefs
common in South Britain than it was formerly : but it ftill prevails very much in
the North, where this relic of barbarity is miftaken for hofpitality. In Ireland, no
man is fuppofed to entertain his guefts well, who does not make them drunk.
Forcing people to drink, is certainly the greateft piece of rudenefs that any man
can be guilty of. Bravado, complailance, or mere good-nature, may induce a
man to take his glafs, if urged to it, at a time when he might as well take poifon.
The cuftom of drinking to excels has long been out of falhion in France; and, as
it begins to lofe ground among the politer part of the Englifh, we hope it will foon
be banilhed from every part of the united kingdom,

Of the PASSIONS.
The paffions have great influence both in the caufe and cure of difeafes. How
the mind affects the body, will, in all probability, ever remain a fecret. It is
luflicient for us to know, that there is eftablifhed a reciprocal influence betwixt
the mental and corporeal parts, and that whatever injures the one, diforders the
other.
Of Anger. —The paflion of anger ruffles the mind, diftorts the countenance,
hurries on the circulation of the bjood, and diforders the whole vital and animal
functions. It often occalions fevers, and other acute difeafes, and fometimes even
ludden death. This paflion is peculiarly hurtful to the delicate, and thole of weak
nerves. I have known luch perfons frequently lofe their lives by a violent fit of
anger, and would advife them to guard againft the excels of this paflion with the
ulmoft care. It is not indeed always in our power to prevent being angry; but
we may lurely avoid harbouring refentment in our breaft. Refentment preys upon
the mind, and occafions the moft obftinate chronical diforders, which gradually
wafte the conftitution. Nothing {flows true greatnefs of mind more than to forgive
injuries: it promotes the peace of fociety, and greatly conduces to our own ealb,
health, and felicity. Such as value health Iflouldavoid violent gufts of anger as
they would the moft deadly poil'on. Neither ought they to indulge refentment,
but to endeavour at all times to keep their minds calm and ferene. Nothing tends
fo much to the health of the body as a conftant tranquillity of mind. Add to this,
die indecency of extravagant anger ;
how it renders us, whillt it lafts, the fcom
and fport of all about us, of which it leaves us, when it ceafes, lenfible and alflam-
ed; the inconveniences and irretrievable mifeondufit into which our irrafeibility
has fometimes betrayed us ;
the friendlflips it has loft us ;
the diftreffes and em-
barrafl’ments in which we have been involved by it, and the lore repentance which
on one account or other it always cofts us.
Phyficians and naturalifts afford inftances of very extraordinary effects of this
paflion. —Borrichius cured a woman ofan inveterate tertian ague, which had baffled
the art of phyfic, by putting the patient in a furious fit of anger. Valeriola made
ufe of the fame means, with the like l'uccefs, in a quartan ague. —The fame paflion
has been equally falutary to paralytic, gouty, and even dumb, perfons ;
to which
laft it has fometimes given the ufe of l’peech. Etmuller gives divers intiances of
very lingular cures wrought by anger; among others, he mentions a perfon laid
up in the gout, who, being provoked by his phvfician, flew upon him, and was
cured. It is true, the remedy is fomewhat dangerous in the application, when a
1
atient does not know’ how to ufe it with moderation. We meet withfeveral in*
No. 12. 3 B fiances
1 86 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
fiances of princes to whom it has proved mortal ;
for example, Valentinian the
Firft, Wenceflas, Matthias Corvinus king of Hungary, and others. There are
alfo inftances wherein it has produced the epileply, jaundice, cholera-morbus
diarrhoea, See. In fa£t, this paffion is of fuch a nature, that it quickly throws
the whole nervous fyftem into preternatural commotions, by a violent ftricture of
the nervous and mufcular parts ;
and furprifingly augments not only the lyftole of
the heart and of its contiguous veffels, but alfo the tone of the fibrous parts in
the whole body. It is alfo certain that this paffion, by the lpafmodic ftricture it
produces in the parts, exerts its power principally on the ftomach and inteftines,
which are highly nervous and membranous parts ;
whence the lymptoms are more
dangerous, in proportion to the greater content of the ftomach and inteftines with
the other nervous parts, and almoft with the whole body. The unhappy influence
of anger likewife, on the biliary and hepatic d uCts, is very furprifing ; fince, by an
intenfe conftriction of thefe, the liver is not only rendered feirrhous, but ftones alfo
are often generated in the gall-bladder and biliary du6ls ; thefe accidents have
fcarcely any other origin than an obftruction of the free motion and efflux of the
bile, by means of this violent ftriCture. From fuch a ftriCture of thefe duCts like-
wife proceeds the jaundice, which in procefs of time lays a foundation for calculous
concretions in the gall-bladder. Laftly, by increafing the motion of the fluid, or
the fpafms of the fibrous parts, by means of anger, a larger quantity of blood is
propelled with an impetus to certain parts ;
whence it happens that they are too
much diftended, and the orifices of the veins diftributed there are too much open-
ed. It is evident from experience, that anger has a great tendency to excite he-
morrhages, either from the nofe, the aperture of the pulmonary artery, the veins of
the anus ;
or in women, from the uterus, elpecially in thofe previoufly accuftomed
and difpofed to fuch evacuations.
Of Fear.—The influence of fear, both in occafioning and aggravating difeafes,
is very great. No man ought to be blamed for a decent concern about life ;
but
too great a defire to preferve it, is often the caufe of lofing it. Fear and anxiety
by deprefling the fpirits, not only difpole us to difeafes, but often render thofe
difeafes fatal which an undaunted mind would overcome. Sudden fear has gene-
rally violent effects. Epileptic fits, and other convulfive diforders, are often oc-
eafioned by it. Hence the danger of that practice, fo common among young
people, of frightening one another. Many have loft their lives, and others have
been rendered miferable, by frolics of this kind. It is dangerous to tamper with
the human paffions. The mind may eafily be thrown into fuch diforder as never
again to a£t with regularity.
Cut
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 187
But the gradual effe6ts of fear prove moft hurtful. The conftant dread of fome
future evil, by dwelling upon the mind, often occafions the very evil itlelf. Hence
it comes to pafs, that fo many die of thofe very difeafes of which they long had a
dread, or which had been imprefled on their minds by fome accident, or foolitli
prediction. This, for example, is often the cafe with women in child-bed. Many
of thofe who die in that fituation are imprefled with the notion of their death a
long time before it happens ;
and there is real'on to believe, that this impreflion is
often the caufe of it. The methods taken to imprefs the minds of women with
the apprehenflons of the great pain and peril of child-birth, are very hurtful. Few
women die in labour, though many lofe their lives after it ;
which may be thus ac-
counted for. A woman after delivery, finding herl'elf weak and exhaufted, imme-
diately apprehends the is in danger ;
and this fear feldora fails to obftruCt the ne-
eefiary evacuations upon which her recovery depends. Thus the fex often fall a
lacrifice to their own imaginations, when there would be no danger, did they appre-
hend none. It feldom happens, when two or three women, in a great town, die in
child- bed, but their death is followed by many others. Every woman of their ac-
quaintance who is with child dreads the fame fate, and the difeafe becomes epide-
mical by the mere force of imagination. This fliould induce pregnant women to
defpife fear, and by all means to avoid thofe tattling goflips who are continually
buzzing in their ears the misfortunes of others. Every thing that may in the leafl:
alarm a patient, or a child-bed woman, ought with the greateft care to be guarded
againft.
In general, the effeCts of terror are a contraction of the finall veflels and a repul-
fion of the blood in the large and internal ones ;
hence proceed a fuppreffion of
perfpiration, a general oppreffion, trembling, andanguilhof the heart, and lungs,
overcharged with blood. Frights often occafion incurable difeafes, as epilepiy,
ftupor, madnefs, &c. .
In acute difeafes, they have evidently killed many, by the
agitation into which they have thrown the fpirits, already too much difordered.
We have alto accounts of perfons abfolutely killed by terrors when in perfect health
at the time of receiving the fhock from them :
people ordered to be executed, but
with private orders for a reprieve, have expired at the block without a wound.
Out of many inftances of the fatal efiedts of fear recorded in writers, the follow-
ing is felefited as one of the moft fingular. “ George Grochantzy, a Polander,
who had inlifted as a foldier in the lervice ot the King ot Pruflia, deferted during
the war. A finall party was lent in purfuit of him ;
and, when he lealt expected it,
they furprifed him tinging and dancing among a company of pealants, who were
got together at an inn and were making merry. This event, fo ludden and un-
forefeen, and at the fame time fo dreadful in its confequences, ftruck him in luch a
manner,
188 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
manner, that, giving a great cry, he became at once altogether ftupid and in-
fenfible, and was feized without the leaft refiftance. They carried him away to
Glogau, where he was brought before the council of war, and received fentence
as a delerter. He fullered himlelf to be led and difpofed of at the will of thofe
about him, without uttering a word, or giving the leaft fign that he knew what
had happened or would happen to him. He remained immoveable as a ftatue
wherever he was placed, and was wholly paffive with refpedt to all that was done
to him or about him. During all the time that he was in cuftody, he neither ate,
nor drank, nor flept, nor had any evacuation. Some of his comrades were lent
to fee him ;
after that he was vifited by fome officers of his corps and by fome
priefts ;
but he ftill continued in the fame ftate, without difcovering the lealt figns
of fenfibility. Promifes, ijitreaties, and threatenings, were equally ineffectual.
The phyficians who were confulted upon his cafe were of opinion, that he was in
a ftate of hopelefs idiocy. It was at firft fufpected, that thofe appearances were
feigned ;
but thefe fufpicions neceffarily gave way when it was known that he took'
no fuftenance, and that the involuntary functions of nature were in great mealure
lufpended. After fome time they knocked off his fetters, and left him at liberty
to go whither he would. He received his liberty with the fame infenfibility that he
had ffiow’n on other occafions: he remained fixed and immoveable; his eyes
turned wildly here and there without taking cognizance of any object, and the
mufcles of his face were fallen and fixed like thofe of a dead body. Being left to
himfelf, he palled twenty days in this condition, without eating, drinking, or any
evacuation, and died on the twentieth day. He had been fometimes heard to fetch
deep fighs ;
and once he rullied with great violence on a foldier, who had a mug of
liquor in his hand, forced the mug from him, and, having drank the liquor with
great eagernefs, let die mug drop to the ground.
”
When a perl’on is affected with terror, the principal endeavour lliould be to re-
ftore the circulation to its due order, to promote prefpiration, and to allay the
agitation of the patient. For thefe purpoles he may drink a little warm liquor,
as camomile-tea, & c. the feet and legs may be put into warm water, the legs rub-
bed, and the camomile-tea repeated every fix or eight minutes ;
and when the lkin
is warm, and there is a tendency to perfpiration, lleep may be promoted by a
gentle opiate. But frights have been known not only to caufe, but alio to cure,
difeafes. Mr. Boyle mentions agues, gout, and fciatica, cured by this means.
To turn from the lerious to the ludicrous effedts of fear, the following inltance
of the latter fort, quoted from a French author by Mr. Andrews in his volume
of Anecdotes, fhows upon what flight occafions this paffion may be fometimes ex-
cited in a very high degree, even in perlons the molt unlikely to entertain l’uch a

gueft. “ Charles Guftavus (the fucceffor of Chriftina of Sweden) was beueging
Prague, when a boor of moft extraordinary vifage defired admittance to his tent;
and, being allowed entrance, offered, by way of amufing the king, to devour a
whole hog of one hundred' weight in his prefence. The old general Koningfmark,
who ftood by the king’s fide, and who, foldier as he was, had not got rid of the
prejudices of his childhood, hinted to his royal rnafter that the pea fan t ought to be
burnt as a l’orcerer. ‘
Sir,’ faid the fellow, irritated at the remark, ‘if your raa-
jefty will but make that old gentleman take off his fword and his fpurs, I will eat
him immediately, before I begin the hog.’ General Koningfmark (who had, at the
head of a body of Swedes, performed wonders againft the Auftrians, and ’.vho wr
as
looked upon as one of the braveft men of the age) could not ftand this propofal,
efpecially as it wr
as accompanied by a moft hideous and preternatui’al expanlion of
the frightful peafant’s jaws. Without uttering a word, the veteran fuddenly turned
round, ran out of the court, and thought not himfelf l’afe until he had arrived at
his quarters; where he remained above twenty-four hours locked up fecurely, be-
fore he got rid of the panic which had fo leverely affected him.”
Fear Ihould not rife higher than to make us attentive and cautious ;
when it
gains an alcendency in the mind, it becomes an inlupportable tyranny, and ren-
ders life a burden. The objedt of fear is evil ;
and to be exempt from fear, or at
leaft not enflaved to it, gives dignity to our nature, and invigorates all our facul-
ties. Yet there are evils which we ought to fear. Thofe that arife from ourfelves,
or which it is in our power to prevent, it would be madnefs to defpife, and auda-
city not to guard againft. External evils, which we cannot prevent, or could
not avoid without a breach of duty, it is manly and honourable to bear with for-
titude. Infenfibility to danger is not fortitude, any more than the incapacity of
feeling pain can be ealled patience ;
and to expofe ourfelves unneceflarily to evil is
vorfe than folly, and very blameable prefumption.
Or IMPOTENCY occasioned by FEAR.
IT has been proved by Dr. Hunter, that impotency is frequently the refult of
fear. He obferves, that as the “ parts of generation are not neceffary for the
oxiftence or fupport of the individual, bpt have a reference to fomething elie in
which the mind has a principal concern ;
fo a complete adtion in thofe parts can-
not take place without a perfect harmony of body and of mind : that is, there mult
be both a power of body and dilpofition of mind ;
for the mind is fubject to a
.thoufand alarms which affedt the actions of thefe parts. —Copulation is an act of
the body, the fpring of which is in the mind ;
but it is not volition : and according
No. 13. SC to
190 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
to the ftate of the mind, fo is the act performed. To perform this p.Ct well, the
body fhould be in health, and the mind fhould be perfectly confident of the powers
of the body : the mind fhould be in a ftate entirely difengaged from every thing
elfe; it fhould have no difficulties, no fears, no appreheniions, not even an
anxiety to perform the a6t well; for even this anxiety is a ltate of mind different
from what fhould prevail ;
there ihould not be even a fear that the mind itfelf
may find a difficulty at the time the aCt fhould be performed. Perhaps no function
of the machine depends fo much upon the ftate of the mind as this. —The will and
reafoning faculty have nothing to do with this power ;
they are only employed in
the aCt, fo far as voluntary parts are made ufe of; and if they ever interfere, which
they fometimes do, it often produces another ftate of mind which deftroys that
which is proper for the performance of the aCt, it produces a defire, a wifh, a
hope, which are all only diffidence and uncertainty, and create in the mind the
idea of a poffibility of the want of fuccefs, which deftroys the proper ftate of mind,
or neceffary confidence. —There is perhaps no aCt in which a man feels himfelf
more interefted, or is more anxious to perform well ;
his pride being engaged in
fome degree, which if within certain bounds would produce a degree of perfection
in an aCt depending upon the will, or an aCt in voluntary parts ;
but, when it pro-
duces a ftate of mind contrary to that ftate on which the perfection of the aCt de-
pends, a failure muft be the confequence. —The body is not only rendered inca-
pable of performing this aCt by the mind being under the above influence of fear,
but alfo by the mind being, though perfectly confident of its power, yet confcious
of an impropriety in performing it; this, in many cafes, produces a ftate of mind
which lhall take away all power. The ftate of a man’s mind refpeCting his fitter
takes away all power. A conl’cientious man has been known to lofe his powers on
finding the woman he was going to be connected with unexpectedly a virgin. —Shed-
ding tears arifes entirely from the ftate of the mind, although not fo much a com-
pound aCtion as the act in queftion ;
for none are fo weak in body that they can-
not fhed tears ;
it is not fo much a compound aCtion of the mind and ftrength of
body joined, as the other aCt is
;
yet, if we are afraid of fhedcling tears, or are de-
firous of doing it, and that anxiety is kept up through the whole of an affeCting
fcene, we certainly lhall not Ihed tears, or at leaft not fo freely as would have
happened from our natural feelings.”
From this account of the neceffity of having the mind independent relpeCting the
aCt, we mult fee that it may very often happen that the ftate of mind will be'fuch
as not to all»ow the animal to exert his natural powers ;
and every failure increafes
the evil. ,
We mult alfo fee from this ftate of the cafe, that this aCt muff be often
interrupted ;
and, the true caule of this interruption not being known, it will be
laid
191
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES.
laid to the charge of the body, or want of powers. As thefe cafes do not arile from
real inability, they are to be carefully diftmguifhed from luch as do ;
and perhaps
the only way to diftinguilh them is, to examine into the date of mind refpecting
this a£t. So trifling often is the circumftance which fhall produce this inability
depending on fear, that the very defire to pleale fhall have that effect, as in making
the woman the foie object to be gratified.
Cafes of this kind we fee every day ;
one of which I fhall relate as an illuftration
of this fubjefit, and alfo of the method of cure. —A gentleman told me, that he
had loft his virility. After above an hour's inveftigation of the cafe, I made out
the following facts: that he had at unneceflary times ftrong erections, which
fliowed that he had naturally this power ; that the erections were accompanied
with defire, which are all the natural powers wanted ;
but that there was ftill a
defefit fomewhere, which I fuppofed to be from the mind. I inquired if all women
were alike to him? His anfwer was, No ;
fome women he could have connection
with as well as ever. This brought the defect, whatever it was, into a fmaller
compafs: and it appeared there was but one woman that produced this inability,
and that it arofe from a defire to perform the a6t with this woman well : which 4
defire produced in the mind a doubt or fear of the want of fuccefs, which was "
the caufe of the inability of performing the a6t. As this arofe entirely from the
ftate of the mind produced by a particular circumftance, the mind was to be ap-
plied to for the cure; and I told him that he might be cured, if he. could perfefitly
rely on his own power of lelf-denial. When I had explained what I meant, he told
me that he could depend upon every a£t of his will or refolution. I then told him,,
that, if he had a perfect confidence in himfelf in that refpefit, he was to go to bed
to this woman, but firft promife to himfelf that he would not have any connection
with her for fix nights, let his inclinations and powers be what they would ;
which !
he engaged to do, and alfo to let me know the refult. About a fortnight after,
he told me, that this refolution had produced fuch a total alteration in the ftate
of his mind, that the power foon took place; for, inffead of going to bed with the
fear of inability, he went with fears that he fhould be pofleffed wfith too much
defire, too much power, fo as to become uneafy to him; which really happened;
for he would have been happy to have fhortened the time : and, when he bad once
broke the fpell, the mind and powers went on together, and his mind never re-
turned to its former ftate.
Impotency alfo happens from a want of proper correfpondence between the
afition of the tefticles and penis : for we find that an irregularity in the afitions of
thefe parts fometimes happens in men, producing impotence ;
and fomething fimilar
probably may .be one caufe of barrennefs in women, In men, the parts fubfervient
1 to
192 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
to generation may be divided into two ;
the effential and the acceffory. The
tefticles are the effential ;
the penis, &c. the acceffory. As this divifion arifes
from their ufes or actions in health, which exadtly correl’pond with one another, a
want of exactnefs in the correfpondence or fufceptibility of thofe adtions may alfo
be divided into two
:
where the actions are reverfed, the acceffory taking place
without the firft or effential, as in the erections of the penis, where neither the mind
nor the tefticles are ftimulated to action ;
and the fecond is where the tefticles per-
form the adtion of fecretion too readily for the penis, which has not a correlpond-
ing erection. The firft is called priapifm ;
and the fecond is what ought to be
called leminal weaknels. —The mind has confiderable effect on the correfpondence
of the adtions of thefe two parts: but it would appear in many inftances, that
erections of the penis depend more on the ftate of the mind than the fecretion of
the femen does ;
for many have the fecretion, but not the erection ;
but in l'uch,
the want of eredtion appears to be owing to fears of the mind only.
Priapifm often arifes fpontaneoufly ;
and often from vifible irritation of the
penis, as in the venereal gonorrhoea, efpecially when violent. The fenlation of
fuch erections is rather uneafy than pleafant; nor is the fenfationof the glans at
the time fimilar to that arifing from the eredtions of defire, but more like to the
lenfation of the parts immediately after coition. Such as arile fpontaneoufly are
of more ferious confequence than thofe from inflammation, as they proceed pro-
bably from caufes not curable in themfelves or by any known methods. The pria-
pifm arifing from inflammation of the parts, as in a gonorrhoea, is attended with
nearly the fame lymptoms; but generally the fenfation is that of pain, proceeding
from the inflammation of the parts. It may be obferved, that what is laid of pria-
pifm is only applicable to it when a difeafe in itfelf, and not when a fymptom of
other difeafes, which is frequently the cafe.
Seminal w’eaknefs, or a fecretion and emiffion of the femen without eredtions,
is the reverie of a priapifm, and is by much the worft difeafe of the two. There
is great variety in the degrees of this difeafe, there being all the gradations from
the exact correfpondence of the actions of all the parts to the tefticles adting alone ;
in every cafe of the difeafe, there is too quick a fecretion and evacuation of the fe-
men. Like to the priapifm, it does not arile from defires and abilities ;
although
when mild it is attended with both, but not in a due proportion ;
a very flight de-
lire often producing the full effect. The fecretion of the femen fhall be fo quick,
that Ample thought, or even toying, lhall make it flow.—Dreams have produced
this evacuation repeatedly in the fame night ;
and even when the dreams have been
fo flight, that there has been no confcioufnefs of them when the fleep has been
broken by the act of emiffiOin. I have known cafes where the tefticles have been
fo
193
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES.
To ready to fecrete, that the leaft fri&ion on the glans has produced an emiflion:
I have known the Ample action of walking or riding produce this effeft, and that
repeatedly in a very fhort lpace of time. A young man, about four or five and
twenty years of age, not fo much given to venery as moft young men, had tliefe
laft-mentioned complaints upon him. Three or four times in the night he would
emit ;
and if he walked faft, or rode on horfeback, the fame thing would happen.
He could fcarcely have conne&ion with a woman before he emitted, and in the
emiffion there was hardly any fpafm. He tried every fuppofed ftrengthening me-
dicine, as alfo the cold bath and fea-bathing, but with no effea By taking twenty
drops of laudanum on going to bed, he prevented the night-emiffions ;
and, by
taking the fame quantity in the morning, he could walk or ride without the before-
mentioned inconvenience. I directed this practice to be continued for fome time,
although the difeafe did not return, that the parts might be accuftomed to this healthy
ftate of a£tion ;
and I have reafon to believe the gentleman is now well. It was
found neceffary, as the conftitution became more habituated to the opiate, toincreafe
the dofe of it.-—The fpafms, upon the evacution of the femen in fuch cafes, are
extremely flight, and a repetition of them foon takes place ;
the fir ft emiffion not
preventing a fecond ;
the conftitution being all the time but little affe6ted. When
the tefticles aft alone, without the accefl’ory parts taking up the neceflary and natural
confequent action, it is ftill a more melancholy difeafe : for the fecretion arifes from
no vifible or fenfible caufe, and does not give any vifible or fenfible effea, but x*uns
off fimilar to involuntary ftools or urine. It has been obferved that the femen is more
fluid than natural in fome of thefe cafes.
There is great variety in the difeafed aaions of thefe parts ;
of which the follow-
ing cafe may be confidered as an example. A gentleman has had a ftridlurein the
urethra for many years, for which he has frequently uled a bougie, but of late has
neHefited it. He has had no connection with women for a confiderable time, being
afraid of the confequences. He has often in his deep involuntary emiflions, which
generally awake him at the paroxyfin ;
but what furprifes him moft is, that often
he has fuch without any femen pafling forwards through the penis, which makes
him think that at thole times it goes backwards into the bladder. This is not
always the cafe, for at other times the femen pafles forwards. At the time the
femen feems to pafs into the bladder, he has the erection, the dream ;
and is
awaked wr
ith the lame mode of aftion, the fame fenfation, and the fame pleafure,
as when it pafles through the urethra, whether dreaming or waking. My opinion
is, that the fame irritation takes place in the bulb of the urethra without the femen,
that takes place there when the femen enters, in confequence of all the natural
preparatory fteps, whereby the very fame actions are excited as if it came into
No. 13. 3D the
m A KEY TO PHYSIC,
the paflage ;
from which one would fuppole, that either the lemon is not lecreted ;
or, it' it be, that a retrograde motion takes place in the aCtions of the accelerators
urina?. But, if the firft be the cafe, then we may luppofe, that in the natural ftate
the actions of thole muicles do not arife fun ply from the ftimulus of the femen in
the part, but from their action being a termination of a preceding one making
part of a feries of actions. Thus they may depend upon the friCtion, or the ima-
gination of a friction, on the penis : the tefticles not doing their part, and the
fpafm in fuch cafes arifing from the friction and not from the fecretion. In m&ny
of thofe cafes of irregularity, when the ereCtion is not ftrong, it fhall go oft' with-
out the emiffton; and at other times an emiflion fhall happen almoft without an
erection ;
but thefe arife not from debility, but affections of the mind. In many
of the preceding cafes, waffling the penis, fcrotum, and peringeum, with cold
water, is often of fervice ;
and, to render it colder than we find it in fome feafons of
the year, common l'alt may be added to it, and the parts waftied when the fait is
almoft diffolved.
Of GRIEF.
GRIEF is the moft cleftruCtive of all the paflions. Its effects are per-
manent, and when it links deep into the mind, it generally proves fatal. An-
ger and fear being of a more violent nature, feldom laft long; but grief often
changes into a fixed melancholy, which preys upon the fpirits, and waftes the
conftitution. This paffion ought not to be indulged. • It may generally be con-
quered at the beginning ;
but, when it has gained ftrength, all attempts to remove
it are vain. No perfon can prevent misfortunes in life ; but it fhows true great-
nefs of mind to bear them with ferenity. Many perfons make a merit of indulging
grief, and, when misfortunes happen, they obltinately refufe all confolation,
till the mind, overwhelmed with melancholy, finks under the load. Such conduct
is not only deftru&ive to health, but inconffltent with reafon, religion, and common
fenfe.
Change of ideas is as neceflary for health as change of pofture. When the
mind dwells long upon one fubjeft, efpecially of a difagreeable nature, it hurts
the whole functions of the body. Hence grief indulged fpoils the digeftion and
deftroys the appetite ;
by which means the Ipirits are deprefled, the nerves relaxed,
the bowels inflated with wind, and the humours, for want of frefh lupplies ot chyle,
vitiated. Thus many an excellent conftitution has been ruined by a family mis-
fortune, or any thing that occafions excefiive grief. It is utterly impoflible, that
any perfon of a dejected mind fhould enjoy health. Life may indeed be dragged
out for a few years : but whoever would live to a good old age nruft be good-
humoured
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 195
humoured and cheerful. This indeed is not altogether in our own power; yet
our temper of mind, as well as our actions, depend greatly upon ourfelves. We
can either afl’ociate with cheerful or melancholy companions, mingle in the amufe-
ments and offices of life, or fit ftill and brood over our calamities, as we choofe.
Thefe, and many fuch things, are certainly in our power, and from thele the
mind generally takes its caft. —The variety of fcenes which prefent themfelves to
the fenfes, were certainly defigned to prevent our attention from being too long
fixed upon any one objeSt. Nature abounds with variety, and the mind, unlefs
fixed down by habit, delights in contemplating new bbjefits. This at once points
out the method of relieving the mind in diftrefs. Turn the attention frequently to
new objects: examine them for fome time: when the mind begins to recoil, ihift
the fcene : by this means a conftant fucceffion of new ideas may be kept up, till the
difagreeable ones entirely difappear. Thus travelling, the ftudy of any art or
faience, reading or writing on fuch fubjects as deeply engage the attention, will
fooner expel grief than the moft fprightly amufements.
It has already been obferved, that the body cannot be healthy unlefs it be exer-
cifed ;
neither can the mind. Indolence nourifhes grief. When the mind has no -
thing elfe to think of but calamities, no wonder that it dwells there. Few people
who purfue bufinefs with attention are hurt by grief. Inftead therefore of abftract-
ing ourfelves from the world or bufinefs, when misfortunes happen, we ought to
engage in it with more than ul’ual attention, to difcharge with double diligence the
functions of our ftation, and to mix with friends of a cheerful and facial temper.
Innocent amufements are byno means to be neglected. Thefe, by leading the mind
infenfibly to the contemplation of agreeable objects, help to difpel the gloom which
misfortunes caft over it. They make time feem lels tedious, and have many other
happy effects. Some perfons, when overwhelmed with grief, betake themfelves to
drinking. This is making the cure worfe than the difeafe. It l'eldom fails to end in
the ruin of fortune, character, and conltitution.
Of LOVE.
LOVE is perhaps the ftrongeft of all the paffions ; at leaft, when it becomes
violent, it is lefs fubjedt to the controul either of the underltanding or will than
any ot the reft. Fear, anger, and l'everal other paffions, are neceflary for the
prelervation of the individual, but love is neceflary for the continuation of the
lpecies itlelf: it was therefore proper .that this paffion ftiould be deeply rooted in
the human breaft. —Though love be a ftrong paffion, it is feldom 1b rapid in its
progrels as feveral of the others. Few perfons fall defperately in love all at once.
'
We would therefore advife every one, before he tampers with this paffion, to con-
fid er
196 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
fider well the probability of his being able to obtain the obje£t of his love.
When that is not likely, he fliould avoid every occafion of irtcreafing it. He
ought immediately to fly the company of the beloved objedfc ;
to apply his mind
attentively to bufinel's or ftudy ;
to take every kind of amufement; and, above
all, to endeavour, if poflible, to find another objedt which may engage his affec-
tions, and which it may be in his power to obtain. There is no paffion with
which people are lo ready to tamper as love, although none is more dangerous.
Some men make love for amufement, others from mere vanity, or on purpofe to
fliovv their confequence with the fair. This is perhaps the greateft piece of cruel tv
which any one can be guilty of. What we eagerly with for, we eafily credit.
Hence the too-credulous fair are often betrayed into a fituation which is truly de-
plorable, before they are able to dilcover that the pretended lover wr
as only in jeft.
But there is no jefting with this paffion. When love is got to a certain height, it
admits of no other core but the pofleflion of its objedt, which, in this cafe, ought
always, if poflible, to be obtained. The conduct of parents with regard to the dif-
polal of their children in marriage is often very blameable. An advantageous
match is the conftant aim of parents ;
while their children often fuffer a real mar-
tyrdom between their inclination and their duty. The firft thing which parents
ought to confult, in difpofing of their children in marriage, is certainly their inclina-
tions. Were due regard always paid to thefe, there would be fewer unhappy
couples, and parents would not have fo often caufe to repent the feverity of their
conduct, after a ruined conftitution, a loft character, or a diffracted mind, has fliown
them their miftake.
With regard to love, in its ufual and more appropriate fignification, it may
be defined, “ that aftedtion which, being compounded of animal defire, efteem,
and benevolence, becomes the bond of attachment and union between individuals
of the different fexes ;
and makes them feel in the l’ociety of each other a lpecies
of happinefs which they experience no-where elfe.” We call it an affe&ion rather
than a paffion, becaufe it involves a defire of the happinefs of its objedt: and that
its conftituent parts are thofe which have been juft enumerated, we ihall firft en-
deavour to prove, and then proceed to trace its rife and progress from a felfilh
appetite to a generous fentiment.
Animal defire is the adtual energy of the fenfual appetite ;
and that it is an
eflential part of the complex affection, which is properly called love, is apparent
from this confideration, that, though a man may have fentiments ofefteem and beue-
volence towards women who are both old and ugly, he never fuppoles himfelf to
be in love with any woman towards whom he feels not the fenfual appetite to have
a ftrongcr tendency than to other individuals of her fex. On the other hand, that
3 animal
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 197
animal defire alone cannot be called the affeCtion of love is evident ;
becaufe he
who gratifies fuch a defire without efteeming its object, and wilhing to communi-
cate at the fame time that he receives enjoyment, loves not the woman, but him-
felf. Mere animal defire has nothing in view but the fpecies and the fex of its
objeCt; and, before it make a feleCtion, it muft be combined with fentiments very
different from itfelf. The firft fentiment with which it is combined, and by
which a man is induced to prefer one woman to another, feems to be that by which
we are delighted with gracefulnefs of perfon, regularity of features, and beauty of
complexion. It is not indeed to be denied that there is fomething irrefiftible in
female beauty. The moft fevere will not pretend that- they do not feel an imme-
diate prepofleffion in favour of a handfome woman ;
but this prepoffeflion, even
'when combined with animal defire, does not conftitute the whole of that affeCtion
which is called love. Savages feel the influence of the fenfual appetite, and it is
extremely probable that they have fome ideas of beauty; but among the favages
the affeCtion of love is feldom felt. Even among the lower orders in civil fociety
it feems to be a. very grofs paffion, and to have in it more of the felfiffmefs of
appetite than of the generofity of efteem- To thefe obfervations many exceptions
will no doubt be found; but we fpeak of favages in general, and of the great body
of the labouring poor, who in the choice of their mates do not ftudy—who indeed
are incapable of ftudying—that reCtitude of mind and thofe delicacies of fentiment,
without which neither man nor woman can deferve to be efteemed.
In the favage ftate, and even in the firft ftages of refinement, the bond of
hnion between the fexes feems to confift of nothing more than mere animal defire
and inftinfitive tendernefs for their infant progeny. The former impels them to
unite for the propagation of the fpecies ;
and the latter preferves the union till
the children, who are the fruit of it, are able to provide for their own fubfiftence.
That in fuch unions, whether cafual or permanent, there is no mutual efteem and
benevolence, is apparent from' the ftate of fubjection in which women are held
in rude and uncultivated nations, as well as from the manner in which marriages
are in fuch nations contracted
,
Sweetnefs of temper, a capital article with us in the female character, difplays
itfelf externally in mild looks and gentle manners, and is the firft and perhaps the
moft powerful inducement to love in a cultivated mind. But fuch graces are fcarcely
-difcernible in a female lavage; and even in the moft polilhed woman would not
be perceived by a male favage. Among favages, ftrength and boldnefs are the
only valuable qualities. In thefe, females are miferably deficient ;
for which
real’on they are contemned by the males as beings of an inferior order. The North-
American tribes glory in idlenefs; the drudgery of labour degrades a man in their

opinion, and is proper for women only. To join young perfons in marriage is
accordingly the bufinefs of the parents ;
and it would be unpardonable meannefs in
the bridegroom to fhow any fondnefs for the bride. In Guiana a woman never
cats with her hufband, but after every meal attends him with water for wafhing
and in the Caribbee iflandsfhe is not permitted to eat even in the prefence of her
hufband. Dampier obferves in general, tliat among all the wild nation? with
which he was acquainted the women carry the burdens, while the men walk be-
fore and carry nothing but their arms ;
and that women even of the highelt rank
are not better treated. In Siberia, and even in Ruffia, the capital excepted, men
till very lately treated their wives in every refpefit like flaves. It might indeed be
thought, that animal defire, were there nothing elfe, ihould have railed, women
to l’ome degree of eftimation among men ;
but male favages, utter ftrangers to
decency and refinement, gratify animal defire with as little ceremony as they do
hunger or thirft.
Hence it was that in the early ages of fociety a man purchafed a woman to be
his wife as one purchafes an ox or a fheep to' be food ;
and valued her only as lhe
contributed to his fenfual gratification. Inftances innumerable might be collected
from every nation of which we are acquainted with the early hiftory ;
but we fhall
content ourfelves with mentioning a few. Abraham bought Rebekah, and gave
her to his fon Ifaac for a wdfe. Jacob, having nothing elfe to give, ferved Laban
fourteen years for two wives. To David, demanding Saul’s daughter in marriage,
it was faid, “ the king defireth not any dowry, but an hundred forefkins of the
Philiftines.” In the Iliad, Agamemnon offers his daughter to Achilles for a wife
;
and fays that he would not demand for her any price. By the laws of Ethelbert
king of England, a man who committed adultery with his neighbour's w;
ife was
obliged to pay the hufband a fine, and to buy him another wife. But it is needlefs
to multiply inftances; the practice has prevailed univerfally among nations emerg-
ing from the favage ftate, or in the rudeft ftage of fociety ;
and, w herever it pre-
vailed, men could not poffibly have for the fex any of that tender regard and
efteem which conftitute fo effential a part of the complex affeCtion of love.
But, if among favages and the vulgar, love be unknowm, it cannot poffibly be-
an inftinCtive affection ;
and therefore it may be afked, How it gets pofleffion of
the human heart; and by what means we can judge whether in any particular
inftance it be real or imaginary ? Thefe queftions are of importance, and deferve
to be fully anfw’ered; though many circumftances confpire to render it no eafy
talk to give to them luch anlwers as fhall be perfectly fatisfaCtory. Love can fub-
fift only between individuals of the different'fexes. A man can hardly love two
women at the fame time ;
and we believe that a woman is ftill lefs capable of loving

at once more than one man. Love, therefore, has a natural tendency to make
men and women pair, or, in other words, it is the fource of marriage: but in po-
litlied l’ociety, where alone this affection has any place, fo many things befides mu-
tual attachment are neceflary to make the married life comfortable, that we rarely
fee young perfons uniting from the impulle of love, and have therefore but few op-
portunities of tracing the rife, progrels, and confequences, of the affedtion. We
fhall, however, throw together fuch reflections as have occurred to us on the fub-
ject, not without indulging a hope, that they may be ufeful to the younger part of
our readers when forming the molt important connection in life.
We have faid, that the perfection of beauty, combined with animal deflre, is
the firft inducement which a man can have to prefer one woman to another. It
may be added, that elegance of figure, a placid malculine countenance, with a
perfon which indicates ftrength and agility, are the qualities which firft tend to
attach any woman to a particular man. Beauty is defined, “ That particular form,
which is the moft common of all particular forms to be met with in the fame fpe-
cies of beings.” Let us apply this definition to our own fpecies, and try, by
means of it, to afcertain what conftitutes the beauty of the human face. It is
evident, that of countenances we find a number almoft infinite of different forms,
of which forms one only conftitutes beauty, whilft the reft, however numerous,
conftitute what is not beauty, but deformity or uglinefs. To an attentive ob-
ferver, however, it is evident, that of the numerous particular forms of uglinefs,
there is not one which includes fo many faces as are formed after that particular
caff which conftitutes beauty. Every particular fpecies of the animal as well as of
the vegetable creation may be faid to have a fixed or determinate form, to which,,
as to a centre, nature is continually inclining. Or it may be compared to pendu-
lums vibrating in different directions over one central point; and as they all crofs
the centre, though only one paffes through any other point, 1b it will be found
that perfect beauty is oftener produced by nature than deformity : we do not
mean than deformity in general, but than any one kind and degree of deformity.
To inftance in a particular part of a human feature : the line which forms the
ridge of the nofe is deemed beautiful when it is ftraight ;
but this is likewife the
central form, which is oftener found than any one particular degree of concave,,
convex, or any other irregular form that fhall be propofed. As we are then more,
accuftomed to beauty than deformity, we may conclude that to be the reafon why
we approve and admire it, juft as we approve and admire falhions of drels for no
other reafon than that we are ufed to them. The fame thing may be faid of colour
as of form : it is cultom alone which determines our preference of the colour of
the Europeans to that of the Ethiopians, and which makes them prefer their own
colour
300 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
colour to ours; fo that, though habit and cuftoni cannot be the caufe of beauty,
they are certainly the caufe of our liking it. That we do like it cannot be denied.
Every one is confcious of a pleating emotion when contemplating beauty either in
man or woman; and, when that pleafure is combined with the gratification of the
fenlual appetite, it is obvious that the fum of enjoyment muft be greatly increafed.
The perception of beauty, therefore, neceffarily diredts the energy of the fenfual
appetite to a particular objedt ;
but ftill this combination is a mere felfifli feeling,
which regards its objedt only as the Left of many fimilar inftruments of pleafure.
Before it can deferve the name of love, it muft be combined with efteem, which is
never beftowed but upon moral character and internal worth ;
for let a woman be
ever fo beautiful, and of courfe ever fo defirable as an inftrument of fenfual grati-
fication, if fhe be not poffefTed of the virtues and difpofitions which are peculiar to
her fex, fhe will infpire no man with a generous affedtion. With regard to the
outlines, indeed, whether of internal difpofition or of external form, men and
women are the fame; but nature, intending them for mates, has given them dif-
pofitions, which, though concordant, are however different, fo as to produce
together delicious harmony. The man, more robuft, is fitted for fevere labour,
and for field exercifes; the woman, more delicate, is fitted for fedentary occu-
pations, and particularly for nurfing children. The man, bold and vigorous, is
qualified for being a protedtor; the woman, delicate and timid, requires protec-
tion. Hence it is, that a man never admires a woman for pofTeffing bodily ftrength
or perfonal courage; and women always defpife men who are deftitute of them.
The man, as a protedtor, is directed by nature to govern ;
the woman, confcious
of inferiority, is difpofed to obey. Their intelledtual powers correfpond to the
deftination of nature. Men have penetration and folid judgment to fit them for
governing ; women have underftanding to make an engaging figure under good
government : a greater proportion would excite dangerous rivallhip between the
fexes, which nature has avoided by giving them different talents. Women have
more imagination and fenfibility than men, whicli make all their enjoyments more'
exquifite; at the fame time that they are better qualified to communicate enjoy-
ment. Add another capital difference of difpofition : the gentle and infinuating
manners of the female fex tend to loften the roughnefs of the other fex ;
and, where-
ever women are indulged with any freedom, they polifli looner than men.
Thefe are not the only particulars that diftinguifh the fexes. With refpedt to
the ultimate end of love, it is the privilege of the male, as fuperior and protedtor,
to make a choice: the female, preferred, has no privilege but barely to content
or to refuf'e. Whether this diftinction be the immediate refult of thb originally-
dilfcrent difpofitions of the fexes, or only the effedtof afiociations inevitably form-

ed, may be queftioned; but among all nations it is the practice for men to court,
and for women to be courted : and, were the moft beautiful woman on earth to
invert -this practice, flic would forfeit the efteem, however by her external grace
Hie might excite the defire, of the man whom fiie addreffed. The great moral
virtues which may be comprehended under the general term integrity, are all ablo-
lutely neceffary to make either men or women eftimable ;
but, to procure efteem
to the female character, the modejly peculiar to their fex is a very effential circum-
Itance. Nature hath provided them with it as a defence againft the artful folici-
tations of the other fex before marriage, and alfo as alupport of conjugal fidelity.
A woman, therefore, whole difpofilions are gentle, delicate, and rather timid
than bold, who is poffeffed of a large fiiare of fenfibility and modefty, and whole
manners are loft and infatuating, muft, upon moral principles, command the
efteem and benevolence of every individual of the other fex who is poffefied of
found underftanding ;
but if her perl’on be deformed, or not Inch as to excite
l’ome degree of animal defire, fhe will attraCl no man's love. In like manner, a
man whofe moral character is good, whofe underftanding is acute, and whofe con-
verfation is inftruCtive, muft command the efteem of every fenfible and virtuous
woman ;
but if his figure be difagreeable, his manners unpolifiied, his habits
flovenly, and, aboveall, if he be deficient in personal courage, he will hardly
excite defire in the female breaft. It is only when the qualities which command
efteem are, in the fame perfon, united with thofe which excite defire, that the
individual l’o accomplilhed can be an objeCt of love to one of the other fex ;
but,
when thefe qualities are thus united, each of them increafes the other in the ima-
gination of the lover. The beauty of his miftrefs gives her, in his apprehenfion,
a greater fiiare of gentlenefs, modefty, and every thing which adorns the female
character, than perhaps fiie really polfelTes; whilft this perluafion of her internal
worth makes him, on the other hand, apprehend her beauty to be abfolutely un-
rivalled.
The affeCtion thus generated is more or lei’s pure, and will be more or lefs per-
manent, according as the one or the other part of which it is compounded pre-
dominates. Where defire of polieffion prevails over our efteem of the perfon and.
merits of the defirable objeCt, love lofes its benevolent character ;
the appetite
for gratification becomes ungovernable, and tends violently to its end, regardlefs
of the mifery that muft follow'. In that ftate love is no longer a fvveet agreeable
affeCtion ;
it becomes a felfiih, painful, pafiion, which, like hunger and thirft,
produces no happinels but in the inftant of fruition ;
and, when fruition is over,
difguft-and averlion generally Succeed to defire. On the other hand, where efteem,
founded on a virtuous character and gentle manners, prevails over animal defire,

the lover would not for the world gratify his appetite at the expence of a lady's
honour or peace of mind. He withes, indeed, for enjoyment; and to him en-
joyment is more exquifite than to the mere fenfual lover, becaule it unites lenti-
ment with the gratification of fenfe ;
at the lame time that,- io far from beina; luc-
ceeded by difguft or averlion, it increales his benevolence to the woman, whole
character and manners he efteems, and who has contributed lb much to his plea-
lure. Benevolence to an individual, having a general end, admits of afits without
number, and is feldom fully accomplifhed. Hence mutual love, which is com-
pofed chiefly of efteem and benevolence, can hardly be of a lliorter duration than
its objeCts. Frequent enjoyment endears fuch lovers to each other, and makes
conftancy a pleafure ;
and, when the days of fenfual enjoyment are over, efteem and
benevolence will remain in the mind, making fvveet, even in old age, the fociety
of that pair, in w’hom are collected the affections of hulband, wife, lover, friend
—
the tendereft affeCtions of human nature.
From the whole of this inveftigation, we think it appears, that the affeCtion be-
tween the fexes which deferves the name of love, is infeparably connected with
virtue and delicacy ;
that a man of gallantry cannot be a faithful or a generous
lover ;
that in the breaft of him, who has ranged from woman to woman fo rthe
mere gratification of his fenfual appetite, defire muft have effaced all efteem for
the female character; and that, therefore, the maxim too generally received,
“ that a reformed rake makes the belt hulband,” has very feldom a chance to be
true. We think it may likewife be inferred, that thoufands fancy themfelves in
love who know not what love is, or how it is generated in the human breaft; and
therefore we beg leave to advife fuch of our readers as may imagine themfelves to
be in that ftate, to examine their own minds, with a view to dilcover, whether,
if the objeCts of their love were old and ugly, they would ftill efteem them for the
virtues of their character, and the propriety of their manners. This is a queftion
which deferves to be well weighed by the young and amorous, who, in forming
the matrimonial connection, are too often blindly impelled by mere animal defire,
inflamed by beauty. It may indeed happen, after the pleafure of gratifying that
defire is gone, (and if not refined by efteem and benevolenee, go it muft with a
lwift pace,) that a new bond of attachment may be formed upon more dignified
and more lafting principles ;
but this is a dangerous experiment. Even luppofing
good fenfe, good temper, and internal worth ofevery fort, yet a new attachment, even
upon fuch qualifications, is rarely formed ;
becaufe it commonly, or rather always,
happens, that fuch qualifications, the only folid foundation of an indiffoluble con-
nection, if they did not originally make efteem predominate over animal defire, are
afterwards rendered altogether invifible by latiety of enjoyment creating dilguft,

which is generally the cafe with violent love founded on the defire ot enjoyment
only. As the delicate nature of female honour and decorum, and the inexpreffible
grace of a chafte and modeft behaviour, are the fureft and indeed the only means of
kindling at firft, and ever after of keeping alive, this tender and elegant flame,
and of accomplifhing the excellent ends defigned by it; to attempt by fraud to
violate one, or under pretence of paffion to fully and corrupt the other, and,
by fo doing, toexpofe the too-often credulous and unguarded object, with a wan-
ton cruelty, to the hatred of her own fex and the fcorn of ours, and to the lovveft
infamy of both, —is a conduct not only bafe and criminal, but inconfiftent with that
truly rational and refined enjoyment, the fpirit and quinteflence of which is de-
rived from the bafhful and facred charms of virtue kept untainted, and therefore
ever alluring to the lover’s heart.
The lymptoms produced by love as a difeafe are as follow : The eye-lids often
twinkle ;
the eyes are hollow, and yet appear as if full with pleafure ;
the pulfe
is not peculiar to the paflion, but the fame with that which attends folicitude and.
care. When the objefit of this affection is thought of, particularly if the idea is
fudden, the fpirits are confufed, the pulfe changes, and its force and time are very
variable: in fome inftances, the perfon is fad and watchful ;
in others, not being
confcious of his ftate, he pines away, is llothful, and regardlefs of food. As the
paffion prevails, fighs grow deeper ;
a tremor affefits the heart and pulfe ;
the
countenance is alternately pale and red ; the voice is fuppreflfed ;
the eyes grow
dim : cold lweats break out ;
fleepabfents itfelf; the fecretions become difturbedr
and a lofs of appetite, a hefitic fever, melancholy, or perhaps madnefs, or death,
conftitutes the fad cataftrophe. On this fubject the curious may confult fEgineta

object of their defire, the operation of which was violent and dangerous, and fre-
quently deprived iuch as drank them of their reafon. Some of the moft remark-
able ingredients of which they were compoted were thefe: the hippomanes, the

the hairs on the tip of a wolf’s tail, his fecret parts, the bones of the left fide of a

twitted cords Oi wool in which a perfon had hanged himfelf, rags, torches, reliques,.

potion. The antidotes againlt love were generally agnus crjlus, which has the
power of weakening the generative faculty ;

Of MELANCHOLY.
THE pathology of melancholy and mania is very obfcure ;
as coming on with-
out any fever, or difturbance in the blood's motion. Often alfo they are hereditary,
depending on the original ftrufture of the body, efpecially of the brain ;
the fault
of which, however, cannot be detected by the niceft anatomift. But it is well
known, that various dileafes of the brain, obftructions, tumors, either of the
brain itfelf or of the cranium preffing upon it, any injury done to the head, and,
as fome phyficians relate, the hardnefs and drinefs ,of the brain, and fome peculiar
irritations affeCting the nervous fyftem, are capable of bringing on this malady.
And indeed fo great are the irritations affeCting the nervous fyftem in mad people,
that they often deep little or none for a long time. Yet even this fo defective and
imperfeCt knowledge of the difeafes of the brain and nerves, is by no means free
from difficulties. For, though we know7
that the brain, or a certain part of it, is
hurt, or that it is irritated, by a dwelling, or a pointed bone growing into it, no-
body can foretel how7
great, or what may be the nature of the malady from fuch
a hurt : for examples are not wanting of people who, after lofmg a large part of
the brain, have recovered and lived a long time ;
or of thofe w ho have perceived
no inconvenience from a large portion of that vifcus being corrupted, until
at length they have fallen fuddenly dow7
n and died in convuhions.
Many perfons of a religious turn of mind behave as if they thought it a crime to
be cheerful. They imagine the whole of religion confifts in certain mortifications,
or denying themfelves the fmalleft indulgence, even of the moft innocent amufe-
ments. A perpetual gloom hangs upon their countenances, while the deepeft
melancholy preys upon their minds. At length the faireft profpeCts vanilli, every
thing puts on a difrnal appearance, and thofe very objeCts which ought to give
delight afford nothing but difguft. Life itfelf becomes a burden, and the un-
happy wretch, perluaded that no evil can equal what he feels, often puts an end
to his own miferable exiftence. It is great pity that ever religion ffiould be fo far
perverted as to become the caule of thofe very evils which it was defigned to
prevent. Nothing can be better calculated than true religion to raile and
fupport the mind of its votaries under every affliction that can befal them. It
teaches them, that even the fufferings of this life are preparatory to the happinefs
of
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 205
of the next; and that all who perfift in a courfe of virtue fhall at length arrive at
complete felicity.
Perfons whofe bufinefs it is to recommend religion to others, fhould beware of
dwelling too much on gloomy fubjedts. That peace and tranquillity of mind,
which true religion is calculated to infpire, is a more powerful argument in its
favour, than all the terrors that can be uttered. Terror may indeed deter men
from outward adts of wickednefs ; but can never infpire them with that love of God,
and real goodnefs of heart, in which alone true religion confifts. In Ihort, the
beff way to counteradt the violence of any palfion, is to keep the mind clofely en-
gaged in fome ufeful purfuit.
Of the PROGNOSTICS of DISEASES; with RULES for Preserving
Health.
PROGNOSTIC is a judgment of the event either of a Rate of health, or of a
difeafe ; as, Whether it fhall end in life or death, be long or fhort, mild or malig-
nant, &c. taken from certain fymptoms thereof. When, by the following remarks,
the perfon fhall judge what diforder is coming upon him, or already prefent, a fafe
and effectual remedy will in general be found in the Medical Part of the Herbal
;
but, whenever that work is not fufficiently full to the purpofe, I fhall add fuch
occafxonal obfervations for prevention and cure as have occurred to me in my
late practice.
Hippocrates was the firR who treated of medicine in a regular and rational man-
ner, and he is therefore juftly confidered as the father of phylic. Hippocrates re-
marked four Rages in diRempers ; viz. The beginning of the difeafe, its augmenta-
tion, its Rate or height, and its declination. In fuch difeafes as terminate fatally,
-death comes in place of declination. In the third Rage, therefore, the change is
moR conRderable, as it determines the fate of the Tick perfon ; and this is moR com-
monly done by means of a crijis. By this word he underRood any fudden change in
ficknefs, whether for the better or for the worfe, whether health or death fucceed
immediately. Such a change, he fays, is made at that time by nature either abfol*
ving or condemning the patient. Hence we may conclude, that Hippocrates ima-
gined difeafes to be only a diRurbance of the animal economy, with which Nature
was perpetually at variance, and ufingher utmoR endeavours to expel the offending
caufe. Her manner of adting on thefe occafions is to reduce to their natural
Rate thofe humours whofe difcord occafions the diRurbance of the whole body,
whether in relation to their quantity, quality, mixture, motion, or any other way
in which they become offenfive. The principal means employed by nature for this
No. 14. 3 G end
406 a KEY TO PHYSIC,
end is what Hippocrates calls concoction. By this he underfloor! the bringing th*
morbific matter lodged in the humours to fuch a (late, as to be eafily fitted for ex_
pulfion by whatever means nature might think moll: proper. When matters are
brought to this pafs, whatever is fuperfluous orhurtful immediately empties itftlf, or
nature points outto phyficiansthe way bywhichfuch an evacuation isto beaccom-
plifhed. The crifis takes place either by bleeding, ftool, vomit, fweat, urine, tu-
mors or abfceffes, fcabs, pimples, fpots, &c. But thefe evacuations are not to be
looked upon as the effe&s of a true crifis, unlefs in confiderable quantity j fmall
difcharges not being fufficientto make acrifis; which, on the contrary, are a iign
that nature is depreffed by the load of humours, and that the lets them go
through weaknefs and continual irritation. What comes forth in this manner is
crude, becaufe the diftemper is yet too ftrong; and, while matters remain in this
ftate, only a bad or imperfe6t crifis is to be expe6ted. This fhows that the dif-
temper triumphs, or at leaf!; is equal in ftrength to nature, which prognofticates
death, or a prolongation ofthedifeafe. Inthislaft cafe, however, nature often hasan
opportunity of attempting a new cnlis more happy than the former, after having
made frefh efforts to advance the eonco6lion of the humours.—It muft here be ob-
ferved however, that, according to Hippocrates, eonco6tion cannot be made but
in a certain time, as every fruit has a limited time to ripen: for he compares the
humourswhich nature has digefted to fruits come to maturity. The time required
for conco6tion depends on the differences among diflempersmentioned above. In
thofe which Hippocrates calls very acute, the digeftion or crifis happens by the
fourth day; in thofe which are only acute, it happens on thefeventb, eleventh,
or fourteenth, day ;
which laft is the longeft period generally allowed by Hippocrates
indiftempersthat aretruly acute, though in fome places he ftretches it to the twen-
tieth or twenty'-firft, nay, fometimes to the fortieth or fixtieth, days. All difeafes
that exceed this laft term arecalled chronical. And while,in thofe difeafes thatex-
ceed fourteen days,heconliders every fourth day as critical, or at leaft remarkable,
by which we may judge whether t he crifis on the fourth day will be favourable or
not;fo in thofe which run from twenty to forty he reckons only thefevenths, and
in thofe that exceed forty he begins to reckon by twenty. Beyond the hundred
and twentieth he thinks that the number of days has no power over the crifis.
They are then referred to the general changes of the feafons; fome terminating
about the equinoxes ; others about the folflices ; others about the rifing or fetting
•f theftarsof certain conftellations; or, if numbers have yet any place, he reckons
by months, or even wholeyears. Thus (he fays) certain difeafes in children have
their crifis in the feventh month after their birth, and others in their feventh or even
their fourteenth year.
Though
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 207
Though Hippocrates mentions the twenty-firft as one of the critical clays in acute
diftempers, as already noticed; yet, in other places of his works, he mentions alfo
the twentieth. The reafon he gives for this in one of thofe places of his works is,
that the days of ficknels were not quite entire. In general, however, lie is much
attached to the odd days; infomuch that in one of his aphorifms he tell us, “The
fweats that come out upon the third, fifth, feventh, ninth, eleventh, fourteenth,
feventeenth, twenty-firft, twenty-feventh, thirtv-firft, or thirty-fourth, days, are
beneficial ; but thofe that come out upon other days fignify that the fick fiiall be
brought low, that hisdifeafe ftiall be very tedious, and that he fhall be fubjeCt to
relapfes.” He farther fays, that ts
the fever which leaves the fick upon any but an
odd day is ufually apt torelapfe.” Sometimes, however, he confefles that it is other-
wife; and he gives an inftance of afalutary crifis happening on the fixth day. But
thefe are very rare inftances, and therefore cannot, in his opinion, overthrow the
general rule. Befides the crifis, however, or the change which determines the fate
of the patient, Hippocrates often fpeaks of another, which only changes the fpecies
of the diftemper, without reftoring the patient to health; as when a vertigo is
turned to an epilepfy, a tertian fever to a quartan, or to a continual, &c.
But what chiefly contributed to procure the vaft refpeCt generally paid to Hippo
crates, was his accuracy in prognofti.es: thus he not only diftinguifhed one difeafe
from another by the figns which properly belonged to each; but by comparing
the fame fort of diftemper which happened to feveral perfons, and the accidents
which ufually appeared before and after, he could often foretel a dif afe before it
came, and afterwards give a rightjudgment of the event of it. By this way of prog-
nofticating, he came to be exceedingly admired; and this he carried to fuch a
height, that it may juftly be faid to be his raafter-piece ; and Celfus, who lived
after him, remarks that fucceeding phyficians, though they found out feveral new
things relating to the management of difeafes, yet were obliged to the writings of
Hippocrates for all that they knew of figns; and let us add, that we are obliged to
Celfus for a true underftanding of the works of Hippocrates. The firft thing Hip-
pocrates confidered, when 'called to a patient, was his looks.—It was a good fign
with him to have a vifage refembling that of a perfon in health, and the fame with
what the fick man had before he was attacked by the difeafe. As it varied from
this, fo much the greater danger was apprehended. The following is the deferip-
tion which he gives of the looks of a dying man ;
—“When a patient (fayshe) has
his nofe fliarp, his eyes funk, his temples hollow, his ears cold and contracted, the
fkin of his forehead tenfe and dry, and the colour of his face tending to a pale-green
or lead-colour, one may give out for certain that death is very near at hand; unlefs
the ftrength of the patient has been exhaufted all at once by long watchings, or by a
loofenefs.
so8 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
loofenefs, or being a long time without eating.” This obfervation has been con-
firmed by thofe of fucceeding phyficians, who have, from him, denominated it the
Hippocratic face. The lips hanging relaxed and cold, are likewife looked upon by
this author as a confirmation of the foregoing prognoftic. He took alfo his figns
from the difpofition of the eyes in particular. When a patient cannot bear the
light; when heflieds tears involuntarily; when, in fteeping, fome part of the white of
the eye is feen, unlefs he ufually fleeps after that manner, or has a loofenefs upon
him: thefe figns, as well as the foregoing ones, prognofticate danger. The eyes
deadened, with a mill before them, or their brightnefs loft, prefages death, or great
weaknefs. Eyes fparkling, fierce, and fixed, denote the patient to be delirious, or
that he foon will be feized with a frenzy. When the patient fees any thing red, and
like fparks of fire and lightning pafs before his eyes, you may expe6t an hasmor-
rage; and this often happens before thofe crifes which are to be attended by a lofs
of blood. The condition of the patient is alfo Ihown by his pofture in bed. If
you find him lying on one fide, his body, neck, legs, and arms, a little contrafted,
which is the pofture of a man in health, it is a good fign: on the contrary, if he lies
on his back, his arms ftretched out, and his legs hanging down, it is a fign of great
weaknefs; and particularly when the patient Aides or lets himfelf fall down towards
the feet, it denotes the approach of death. When a patient in a burning fever is
continually feelingabout with his hands and fingers, and moves them up before his
face and eyes as if to take aw^ay fomething that parted before them; or on his bed-
covering, as if picking or fearching for little-ftraws, or taking away fome filth, or
drawing out little ftocks of wool; all this is a fign that he is delirious, and that he
will die. Amongft the other figns of a prefent or approaching delirium, he alfo
adds this: When a patient who naturally fpeaks little begins to talk more than he
ufed to do, or when one that talks much becomes filent, this change is to be reck-
oned a fort of delirium, or is a fign that the patient will foon fall into one. The
frequent trembling or ftarting of the tendons of the wrifts prefage likewife a deli-
rium. As to the different forts of delirium, Hippocrates is much more afraid of
thofe that run upon mournful fubje&s than fuch as are accompanied with mirth.
When a patient breathes faft,and is oppreffed, it is a fign that he is in pain, and
that the parts above the diaphragm are inftamed. Breathing long, or when the
patient is a great while in taking his breath, Aiows him to be delirious; but eafy
arid natural refpi ration is always a good fign in acute difeafes. Hippocrates depended
much on the refpiration in making his prognoftics ; and therefore has taken care in
feveral places to defcribe the different manner of a patient’s breathing. Continual
wa chings in acute difeafes, are figns of prefent pain, or a delirium near at hand.
Hippocrates alfo drew figns from all excrements, whatever they are, that are fepa-
rated
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. *©$
rated from the body of man. Mis moft remarkable prognoftics, however, were
from the urine. The patient’s urine, in his opinion, is heft when the fediment is
white, foft to the touch, and of equal confiftence. If it continue fo during the
courfe of the diftemper, and till the time of the crifis, the patient is in no danger,
and will foon be well, This is what Hippocrates called conco6led urine, or what
denotes the concodtion of the humours; and he obferved, that this concofilion of
the urine feldom appeared thoroughly but on the daj^s of the crifis which happily
put an end to the diftemper. £<
We ought (faid Hippocrates) to compare the urine
with the purulent matter which runs from ulcers. As the pus, which is white, and
of the fame quality with the fediment of the urine we are now fpeaking of, is a fign
that the ulcer is on .the point of clofing, fo that which is clear, and of another co-
lour than white, and of an ill fmell, is a fign that the ulcer is virulent, and there-
fore very difficult to be cured: the urines that are like this we have defcribed
are only tbofe which may be named good ; all the reft are ill, and differ from one
another only in the degrees of more and lefs. The firft never appear but when na-
ture has overcome the difeafe; and are a fign of the concodtion of humours, with-
out which you cannot hope for a certain cure. On the contrary, the laft are made
as long as the crudity remains, and the humours continue unconcodled. Among
the urines of this laft fort, the beft are reddifli, with a fediment that is foft, and
‘
of an equal confiftence; which denotes, that the difeafe will be fomewhat tedi-
ous, but without danger. The worft are thofe which are very red, and at the fame
time clear and without fediment; or that are muddy and toubled in the making.
In urine there is often a fort of cloud hanging in the veftel in which it is received ;
the higher this rifes, or the farther diftant it is from the bottom, or the more differ-
ent from the colour of the laudable fediment above-mentioned, the more there is of
crudity. That which is yellow, or of a Tandy colour, denotes abundance of bile;
that which is black is the worft, efpecially if it has an ill fmell, and is either alto-
gether muddy or altogether clear. That whofe fediment is like large ground wheat,
or little flakes or fcales fpread one upon another, or bran, prefages ill, efpecially
the laft.. The fat or oil that fometimes fwims upon the top of the urine, and ap-
pears in a form fomething like a fpider’s web, is a fign of a confumption of the
flefli and folid parts. The making of a great quantity of urine is the fign of a crifis,
and fometimes the quality of it fliows how the bladder is affedled. We muft alfo
ebferve, that Hippocrates compared the ftate of the tongue with the urine; that ia
to fay, when the tongue was yellow, and charged with bile, the urine he knew muft
®f courfe be of the fame colour; and, when the tongue was red and moift, the urine
was of its natural colour. His prognoftics from the excretions by ftool areas follow:
Thofe that are foft, yellowifh, of fome confiftence, and not of an extraordinary ill

fmell, thatanfwer to the quantity of what is taken inwardly, and that are voided at
the ufual hours, are the belt of all. They ought alfo to be of a thicker confidence
when the diftemper is near thecrifis; and it ought to be taken for a good prognof-
tic, whenfome worms, round and long, are evacuated at the fame time with them.
.The prognofis, however, may {till be favourable, though the matter excreted be
thin and liquid, provided it make not too much noife in coming out, and the eva-
cuation be not in a fmall quantity nor too often, fo as to make the patient faint. All
matter that is watery, white, of a pale green or red, or frothy and vifcous, is bad.
That which is blackifh, or of a livid hue, is the molt pernicious. That which is
pure black, and nothing elfe but a difcharge of black bile, always progno (ligates
very ill ; this humour, from what part foever it comes, fliowing the ill difpofition
©f the intellines The matter that is offeveral different colours denotes the length
of the diftemper ; and, at the fame time, that it may be of dangerous confequence.
Hippocrates places in the fame clafs the matter that is bilious or yellow, mixed
with blood, or green and black, or like the dregs or fcrapings of the guts. The
ftools that confifl of pure bile, or entirely phlegm, he alfo looks upon to be very
bad. Matter call up by vomiting ought to be mixed with bile and phlegm ; where
one of thefe humours only is obferved, it is worfe. That which is black, livid,
green, or the colour of a leek, indicates alarming confequences. The fame is to be
faid of that which fmells very ill; and, if at the fame time it be livid, death is no**
far off. The vomiting of blood is very often mortal. The fpittings which give
eafe in difeafes of the lungs and in pleurifes, are thofe that come up readily and
without difficulty: and it is good if they be mixed at the beginning with much yel-
low: but if they appear of the fame colour, or are red, agreat while after the begin-
ning of the diftemper, are fait and acrimonious, and caufe violent coughings, they
are not good. Spittings purely yellow are bad; and thofe that are white, vifcous,
and frothy, give no eafe. Whitenefs is a good ftgn ofconcoction in regard to fpit-
tings; but they ought not all to be vifcous, nor too thick, nor too clear. We
may make the famej
udgment of the excrements of the nofe according to their con-
coCtionand crudity. Spittings that are black, green, and red, are ofbad confequence.
In inflammations of the lungs, thofe that are mixed with bile and blood prefage well
if they appear at the beginning, but are bad if they arife not about the feventh day.
But the word ftgn in thefe diftempers is, when there is no expectoration at all,and
the too great quantity of matter that is ready to be difcharged this way makes a rat-
tling in the bread. After fpittingof blood, the difcharge of purulent matter often
follows, which brings on a confumption, and at laft death. A kind good fweat is
that which arifes on the' day ofthecrifis, and is difcharged in abundance all over the
body, and at the fame time from all parts of the body, and thus carries oflf the fe-
ver.

ver. A cold fvveat is alarming, efpecially in acute fevers, for in others it is only a
fign of long continuance. When the patient fweatsno-wherebut on the head and
neck, it is a fign that the difeafe will be long and dangerous. A gentle fweatin
fome particular part, of the head and bread; for inftance, gives no relief, but de-
notes the feat of the diftemper, or the weaknefs of the part. This kind of fweat was
called by Hippocrates ephidrojis. Thehypochondria, or the abdomen in general,
ought always to be foft and even, as well on the right fide as on the left. When
there is any hardnefs or unevennefs in thofe parts, or heat and fvvellings, or when
the patient cannot bear to have it touched, it is a fign the inteftines are indifpofed.
Hippocrates alfo inquired into the date of the pulfe, or the beating of the
arteries. The moft ancient phyficians, however, and even Hippocrates hinafelf,
for a long time, by this word underftood the violent pulfation that is felt in an in-
flamed part, without putting the fingers to it. It is obferved by Galen, and other
phyficians, that Hippocrates touches on the fubjedt of the pulfe more (lightly than
any other on which he treats. But that our celebrated phyftcian underftood fome-
thingeven on this fubje6t, iseafily gathered from feveral paffages in his writings ;
as when he obferves, that in acute fevers the pulfe is very quick and very great;
and when he makes mention, in the fame place, of trembling pulfes, and thofe that
beat (lowly; when he obferves, that in fome difeafes incident to women, when the
pulfe (trikes the finger faintly, and in a languifhing manner, it is a fign of approach-
ing death. He remarks alfo, in the Coaca? Praenotiones,thathe whofe vein, that is
to fay, whofe artery of the elbow, beats, is juft going to run mad, or elfe that the
perfon is at that time very much under the influence of anger. Many other varia-
tions of the pulfe are enumerated by phyficians, but moft of them uncertain, and
not confirmed by experience. See the Article Pulfe, in the Medical Part of the
Herbal, p. 106. where the fubjeA is more fully treated.
We (hall now proceed to fome farther remarks on the prognostics of par-
ticular DISEASES.
The tertian aguehath eneprognoftic peculiar to itfelf, namely, dry fcabby ulcers
breaking out upon the lips; thefe fometimes appear about the third or fourth
paroxyfm; and then we may venture to foretel that the difeafe will go offfponta-
neoufly after thefeventh.
The following are the prognoftics of a nervous fever
;
and therefore, when they
appear, people (hould take precautions accordingly, by confulting the Medical Part
of the Herbal, p. 128, for a fafe and certain preventative and cure. The patient at
firft grows fomewhat liftlefs, and feels flight chills, and (hudders, with uncertain
flufties of heat, and a kind of wearinefs all over, like what is felt after great fatigue.
This is always attended with a fort ofheavinefs and dejection of fpirits, and more or

lei's ofa toad, pain, or giddinefs ofthe head ; a naufea, or difreliffi ofevery thing, foon
follows, without any condderable third, but frequently with urging to vomit,
though little but inlipid phlegm is brought up. Though a kind of lucid interval
cf feveral hours fometimes intervenes, yet the fymptoms return with aggravation,
efpecially towards night ; the head grows more giddy or heavy ;
the heat greater;
the pulfe quicker, but weak; with an oppreffive kind of breathing. A great tor-
por, or obtufe pain and coldnefs, affccls the hinder-part of the head. frequently,
and oftentimes a heavy pain is felt on the top all alongthe coronary future ; this,
and that of the back-part of the head, generally attend nervous fevers, and are
commonly fncceeded by fome degree of delirium. In this condition the patient
often continues for five or fix days, with a heavy, pale, funk, countenance, feern-
ingly not very Tick, and yet far from being well ; reftlefs, anxious, and common-
ly quite void of deep, though fometimes very drowfy and heavy : but, although lie
appears to thofe about him a&aally to deep he is utterly infendble of it, and de-
nies that he doth fo. The pulfe during all this time is quick, weak, and uneqlial
;
fometimes fluttering, and fometimes for a few moments flow; nay, even intermit-
ting, and then, with a fudden dudi in the face, immediately very quick, and per-
haps foon after furprifingly calm and equal; and thus alternately.
Prognoftics of afcarlct fever. With various general fymptoms of fever, the pa-
tient atfirft complains of a dejection of fpirits,a flight forenefs or rather ftilfnefs in
the neck, with a fenfe of draitnefs in the mufcles of the neck and dioulders, as
if they were bound with cords. The fecond day of the fever this forenefs in the
throat increafes, and the patient finds a difficulty in fwallowing; but the difficulty
feems lefs occadoned by the pain excited in the attempt, or by the draitnefs of the
padage,than by an inability to throw the necedary mufcles into action. Thetkin
feels hot and dry, but not hard ; and the patients experience frequent fmall pun-
gent pains, as if touched with the point of a needle. The breath is hot and burn-
ing to the lips, and third makes them with to drink; but the tendency to ficknefs,
and the exertions necedary indeglution,are fo unpleafant, that they feldom care to
drink much at a time. They have much uneadnefs alfo from want of red during
the night. In the morning of the third day, the face, neck, and bread, appear
redder than ufual : in a few hours thisrednefs becomes univerfal; and increafes to
fuch a degree of intendty, that the face, body, and limbs, refemble a boiled lobfler
in colour, and are evidently fwollen.
The figns ofanimpending phrenitis,or injlammationofthe brain, are fully explained
in the MedicalPart of this work, p. 139. In this difeafe, the following are the mod
fatal fymptoms: A continual and furious delirium, with watching; thin watery
urine.
and the OCCULT SCIENCES. 11 j
urine, white feces, the urine and {tools running off involuntarily, or a total fub-
preffion of thefe excretions ;
a ready difpofttion to become ftupid, or to faint; trem-
bling, rigour, chattering of the teeth, convulfions, hiccough, coldnefs of the extre-
mities, trembling of the tongue, {brill voice, a fudden ceffation of pain, with ap-
parent tranquillity. The following are favourable : Sweats, apparently critical,
breaking out'; a feerning effort of nature to terminate the difeafe by a diarrhoea ;
a large hemorrhage from the nofe ; fwellings of the glands behind the ears
;
haemorrhoids.
A vertigo is obferved to be both thefymptom and forerunner of fome dangerous
difeafes; fuch as apoplexy, or epilepfy, hyfteria; haemorrhages from the nofe and
other parts ; fuppreflion of the menfes; plethora; fevers, as well fuch as are
accompaniedwith debility as thofe in which there is an increafed impetus of the
Mood towards the head; —Though a vertigo be for the moft part a fy mptom and con-
comitant of other difeafes, yet it is fometimes a primary difeafe, returning at inter-
vals, increafing gradually, and equally impeding and deftroying the funsftions of
the body and mind.
A delirium accompanies fevers of many different kinds. Sometimes it is
flight, eaflly removed, and fcarcely to be accounted a bad flgn. Often, however,
it is very violent, and one of the very worft of flgns, requiring the utmoft care and
attention. Adelirium is either fierce or mild. The fierce delirium is oreceded and
accompanied by a rednefs of the countenance, a pain of the head, a great beating,
of the arteries, and noife in the ears ; the eyes imthe mean time looking red, infla-
med, fierce, fliining, and unable to bear the light; there is either no fleep at all,,
orfleep troubled with horrid dreams; the wonted manners are changed, an unu-
fual peeviflmefs and ill-nature prevail; The depravation ofjudgment is firft obfer-
ved between fleep and waking,and by the perfon’s crediting his imagination, while
the perceptions of fenfe are negledted, and the ideas of memory occur in an irregular
manner. Fury at laft takes place, and fometimes an unufual and incredible decree
of bodily ftrength,fo that feveral people can fcarcely keep a Angle patient in his bed.
The mild delirium, on the contrary, is often accompanied with a weak pulfe, a
pale collapfed countenance, and a vertigo when the patient fits in an ere<5t pofture
;
;
he is feldom angry, but often ftupid, and fometimes remarkably grieved and fear-
ful. The lofs of judgment, as in the former kinds, is firft perceived when the
patient is half awake; but a temporary recovery enfues upon the admiffton of the
light and the converfation of his friends. The patient mutters much to himfelf,
and attends little to the things around him ; at laft, becoming quite ftupid, he nei-
ther feels the fenfation of hunger or thirft, nor any of the other propenfities of na-
ture, by which means the urine and excrements are voided involuntarily. As the
No. 14. 3 T diforder-
£14 A KEY tO PHYSIO,
diforder increafes, it terminates in fubfultus tendinuro, tremors, convulfions,
fainting, and death. The other fpecies of delirium alfo frequentljr terminates in
this, when the fpirits and ftrength of the patient begin to fail. The fymptoms ac-
companying either of thefe kinds of delirium fliow an ufual, inordinate, and une-
qual, motion of the blood through the brain, and a great change in that flate of it
which is neceflary to the exercife of the mental powers. It is fuflieiently probable,
that an inflammation of the brain, more or lefs violent and general, fometimes takes
place, although the figns of univerfal inflammation are frequently flight. This we
learn from the diffedtion of dead bodies, which often fliow an univerfal rednefs of
the brain or of fome of its parts, or fometimes an effuflon or fuppuration.
The prognoftics of the malignant,
putrid, or ulcerous, fore throat, are very
different in different perfons. Sometimes a rigour, with fulnefs, and forenefs of the
throat and painful fliffnefs of the neck, are the flrft fymptoms complained of.
Sometimes alternate chills and heats, with fome degree ofgiddinefs, drowfmefs, or
bead-ach, uflier in the diftemper. It feizes others with much more feverifli fymp-
toms; great pain of the head, back, and limbs; avail; oppreffion of the prascordia,
and continual flghing. Some grown perfons go about for fome days in a droop-
ing ftate, with much uneaflnefs and anxiety, till at laft they are obliged to take to
their beds. —Thus various is the difeafe at the onfet. But it commonly begins with
chills and heats, load and pain of the head, forenefs of throat, and hoarfenefs;
fome cough, ficknefs at ftomach, frequent vomiting and purging, in children
efpecially, and fometimes very fevere; though a contrary ftate is more common to
the adult. There is commonly a very great dejedtion of fpirits, very fudden weak-
nefs, great heavinefs on the breaft, and faintnefs, from the very beginning. The
pulfe in general is quick, lmall, and fluttering, though fometimes heavy and undu-
lating. The eyes heavy, reddifli, and as it were weeping ; the countenance often
full, fluflied, and bloated, though fometimes pale and funk. The following are
the prognoftics in the difeafe :
—If a gentle eafyfweat comes on the third or fourth day;
if the pulfe becomes more flow, firm, and equal ; if the floughs of the fauces caft off
in a kindly manner, and appear at the bottom tolerably clean, and florid ; if the brea-
thing is more foft and free, and fome degree of vigour and quicknefs return in the
eves ; all is well, and afalutary crifis follows foon, by a continuance of the lweat, and
a turbid, fubfiding, farinaceous, urine, a plentiful expe&oration, and a very large
defquamation of the cuticle. But if a rigour comes on, and the exanthemata fud-
denly difappear or turn livid ; if the pulfe grows very fmall and quick, and the fkin
remains hot and parched as it were ; the breathing more difficult, the eyes dead and
glaffy, the urine pale and limpid ; a phrenzy or coma may be expected to fucceed,

with a coldifh clammy fweat on the face or extremities; life will now be defpaired
of, efpecially ifafingultus and choaking or gulping in the throat ffiould attend, with
fudden, liquid, involuntary, livid, ftools, intolerably fetid.
Symptoms of the croup,
or inflammation of the glottis. A hoarfenefs, with fame
ffirillnefs and ringing found, both in fpeaking and coughing, as if the noffe came
from a brazen tube. At the fame time there is a fenfe of pain about the larynx,
•fome difficulty of refpiration, with a whizzing found in infpiration, as if thepaffage
of the air were ftraitened. The cough which attends it is commonly dry; and, if
any thing be fpit up, it is a matter of a purulent appearance, and fometimes films
refembling portions of a membrane. With all thefe fymptoms, there is a frequen-
cy of pulfe, a reftleffnefs, and an uneafy fenfe of heat. When the internal fauces
are viewed, they are fometimes without any appearance of inflammation ; but fre-
quently a rednefs, and even fwelling, appears; and fometimes there is an appear-
anceof matter like to that rejected by coughing, together with the fymptoms now
defcribed, and particularly with great difficulty of breathing, and a fenfe of ftrang-
ling in the fauces, by which the patient is fometimes fuddenly taken off.
In a pleurifvt the pathognomonic figns are a cough, a difficulty of breathing, a
pain of the fide, and a continued fever; the adjunCt figns are the various forts of
matter expe&orated, which are fometimes bloody, fometimes bilious, &c. When
the pains, which at firft affedled one fide only, ffiall afterwards fpread into the other
;
or when, leaving the fide firfl affiedled, they pafs entirely into the other ; thefe are
always marks of a dangerous difeafe. A delirium coming on during a pneumonic
inflammation is always a fymptom denoting much danger. Bleeding is the re-
medy chiefly to be depended on ; and may be done in either arm, as the furgeon
finds mod convenient; and the quantity taken away ought in general to be as
large as the patient's ftrength will allow. Yet the patient muft keep out of bed
as much as he can bear; muft have plenty of warm diluting drinks, impregna-
ted with vegetable acids, accompanied with nitre or fome other cooling neutral fait
;
and the belly alfo ought to be kept open by emollient clyfters or cooling laxative
medicines. Vomiting in the beginning is dangerous ; but in a fomewhat advan-
ced ftate of the difeafe emetics havebeen found the beft means of promoting expec-
toration. Fomentations and poultices to the pained part have been found ufeful
;
but bliftering is found to be much more effectual. A blifter, however, ought not
to be applied till at.leaft one bleeding hath been premifed, as venefeCtion is lefs ef-
fectual when the irritation of a blifter is prefent. If the difeafe be moderate, a blif-
ter may be applied immediately after the firft bleeding ; but in violent cafes, where
it may be prefumed that a fecond bleeding may foon be neceffary after the firft, it
will
2x6 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
will be proper to delay the blifter till after the fecond bleeding, when it maybe fup-
pofed that the irritation occafioned by the blifter will be over before a third bleed-
ing becomes n'eceffary. It may frequently be of ufe in this difeafe to repeat the
bliftering ; and in that cafe the plafters ftiould alwaysbe applied fomewhere on the
thorax, for when applied to more diftant parts they have little effedt. The keep-
ing the bliftered parts open, and making what is called a perpetual blifter, has
much lefs effect than arepeated bliftering. When this difeafe terminates unfavoura-
bly, it often ends in an empyema, which is occafioned by the eftufionofa quantity
of purulent matter into the cavity of the thorax, producing a lingering and painful
diforder, very often incurable. The firft fign of an empyema is a cefiation of the
pain in the breaft, which before was continual: this is followed by a fenfation of
weight on the diaphragm ;
and a lludtuation of matter, fometimes- making a noife
that may be heard by the by-ftanders: the acute fever is changed into- a hedlie, witfii
an exacerbation at night: a continual and troublefome dry cough remains, The
refpiration is exceedingly difficult, becaufe the lungs are prevented by the matter
from fully expanding themfelves. The patient can lie eafily on that fide where the
matter is effufed, but not on the other, becaufe then the weight of the matter on
the mediaftinum produces uneafinefs. #
The more the hedtic heat is augmented, the
more is the body emaciated, and its firength decayed. In fome there is danger of
fuffocation when they ftoop down;- which' gods off when they alter that pos-

bloody fetid pus be difcharged, if the fever continue, and if the patient fpit up a
purulent, pale, frothy, livid, or green, matter with a decay of ftrength, there is
no hope; but when a fmall quantity of pus, of a white colour, not very fetid, is dif-
charged; when the fever and thirft prefentlyceafe, the appetite returns, and faeces

there is then hope of a perfedt recovery. If the matter be not dried up in leven weeks

The figns of an inflammation of the ftomach are great heat and pain in the
epigaftric region, extreme anxiety, an almoft continual and painful hiccough, with
a mod painful vomiting of everything taken into the ftomach. This difeafe is
always very dangerous, and the prognofis doubtful, which alfo muft always be in
proportion totbl feverity of the fymptoms. A ceflation of pain, coldnefs about the
praecordia, great debfRty, with a languid and intermitting pulfe, and an abatement
of the hiccough, denote a gangrene and fpeedy death. From the fenfibility of the
ftomach alfo, and its great connection with the reft of the fy Item, it muft be obvious
that an inflammationvof it, by whatever caufes produced, may be attended with fatal
confequences; particularly, by the great debility it produces, it may prove fuddenly
fatal, without gunning through the ufual courfe of inflammations.—Its tendency to
admitof refolution may be known by its having arifen from no violent caufe, by the
moderate ftate of the fymptoms, and by a gradual remiffion of thefe in the courfe
ofthefirft or at moftof the fecond week of the difeafe. The tendency to gangrene
may be fufpeCted from the fymptoms continuing with unremitting violence, not-
withftanding the ufe of proper remedies; and a gangrene already begun may be
known by the fymptoms above-mentioned, particularly great debility and fudden
reflation of pain. The tendency to fuppuration may be known by the fymptoms
continuing but in a moderate degree for more than one or two weeks, and by a
eonfiderable ret*viflion of the pain while afenfe of weight and anxiety ftil! remains.
When an abfcefs has been formed, the frequency of the pulfe is ftrft abated, but foou
after it increafes, with frequent cold fhivering, and an exacerbation in the after-
noon and evening; followed by night-fweats, and other fymptoms of hedlic fever.
Thefe at length prove fatal, unlefs the abfcefs open into the cavity of the ftomach,
the pus be evacuated by vomiting, and the ulcer foon healed.
An inflammation of the inteflines fhows itfelf by a fixed pain in the abdomen,
attended with fever, vomiting, and coftivenefs. The pain is often felt in different
parts of the abdomen, but more frequently fpreads over the whole, and is particu-
larly violent about the navel. Inflammations of the inteflines mayarife from the
fame caufes as thofeof the ftomach; though commonly the former will more rea-
dily occur from cold applied to the lower extremities, or to the belly itfelf. It is
alfo found fupervening on the fpafmodic cholic, incarcerated hernia, and volvulus.
The inflammations of the inteflines have the fame termination with thofe of the
ftomach, and the prognofis in both cafes is much the lame.
Inflammation of the liver is attended with eonfiderable fever ; a frequent, ftrong,
and hard, pulfe; high-coloured urine; an acute pain in the right hypochondrium,
increafedby prefling upon the part. The pain is very often in fuch a part ofthe fide
as to make it appear like a pleurify : and frequently, like that, is increafed on infpr*-

ration. The difeafe is alio commonly attended with a cough, which is generally
dry, but fometimes moift; and, when the pain thus refembles a pleurify, thepatient
cannot lie eafily except upon the fide affeCted. The pain is frequently extended to
the clavicle, and to the top of the fhoulffer ; and is attended fometimes with hic-
cough, and fometimes with vomiting. The inflammation of the liver, like others,
may end by refolution, fuppuration, or gangrene; and the tendency to the one or
to the other of thofe events may be known from what has been already mentioned.
Inflammation of the fpleen, comes on with a remarkable fhivering, fucceeded by a
moft intenfe heat and very great thirft; a pain and tumour are preceived in the left
bypochondrium, and the paroxyfms for the moft part affume a quartan form. When
the patients expofe themfelvesfor alittle tothefreeair, th eir extremities immediately
grow very oold. If an iiaemorrhage happens, the biood flows out of the left noftril.
It is often a very difficult matter to diftinguilh rheumatifm from gout: but in
rheumatifm there in general occurs much lefs affection of the ftomach ; it affeCts
chiefly the larger joints, and often feveral of them at the famfe time: it occurs at an
earlier period of life than gout; it is not obferved to be hereditary ; and it can in ge-
neral be traced to fomeobvious exciting caufe, particularly to the action of cold. To
diftinguilh the chronic rheumatifm from the acute : When the pains are ftill ready to
fluff their place ; when they are efpecially fevere in the night-time ; when, at the
fame time, they are attended with fome degree of pyrexia, and with fome fwelling,
and efpecially fome rednefs, of thejoints; the difeafe is to beconfidered as partaking
of the nature of the acute rheumatifm. But.when there is no longer any degreeof
pyrexia remaining; when the painedjoints are without rednefs; whentheyare cold
and ftiff ;
when they cannot eafily be made to fweat ; or when, while a free and warm
fweat is brought out on the reft of the body, it is only clammy and cold on the pain-
ed joints; and when, farther, the pains ofthefeare increafed by cold, and relieved by
heat, applied to them; the cafe is tobe confidered as that of a purely chronic rheu-
matifm : or perhaps more properly the firft of the conditions now deferibed may be
termed the date of irritability, and the fecond the ftate of atony. The chronic rheu-
matifm, or rather the atonic, may affeCt different joints; but is efpecially apt to affeCt
thofe which are furrounded with many mufcles,and thofe of which the mufclesare em-
ployed in the moftconftantand vigorous exertions. Such is the cafeofthe vertebrae
of the loins, the affection of which is named lumbago ; or of the hip-joint, when the
difeafe is named ifehias or fciatica. Violent drains and fpafms, occurring on fudden
andfomewhat violent exertions, bring on rheumatic affections, which at firft partake
of the chronic rheumatifm. Such are frequently the lumbago, and other affections
which feemto be more feated in the mufcles than in thejoints. The diftinction ofthe

What wecallaparoxyfmofthe gout'vs principally couftituted by an inflammatory
affedtion of fome of the joints. This fometimes' comes on foddenly, without any
warning, but is generally preceded by feveral fymptoms: fucb as the ce tiling of
a Sweating which the feet had been commonly affedted with before; an nnulual
coldnefs of the feet and legs; a frequent numbnefs, alternating with a fenfe of
pricking along the whole of the lower extremities; frequent cramps of the
inufcles of the legs; and an unufual turgefcence of the veins. While thefe
fymptoms take place in the lower extremities, the body is affedted with fome
degree of torpor and languor, and the fundtions of the ftomach in particular
are more or lefs difturbed. The appetite is diminifhed; and flatulency, or
other fymptoms of indigeftion, are felt Thefe fymptoms take place for feveral
days, fometimes for a week or two, before a paroxyfm comes o n; but commonly,
u pou the day immediately preceding it, the appetite becomes keener than ufuah
It is commonly fuppofed, that there are fome cafesof rheumatifm which are fcarcely
to be diftinguiflied from the gout: but thefe, Dr. Cullen thinks, are but few; and
that the two difeafes may be for the moft part diftinguifhed with great certainty',
by observing the pre-difpofition, the antecedent circumftances, the parts affedted,
the recurrences of the difeafe, a nd its connedlion with the fyftem ;
which circum-
ftances, for the moft part, appear very differently inthetwo difeafes.

which fliow an accumulation of vitiated bile in the gall-bladder and biliary dudfcs,

Thefmall-pox begin with afynochaor inflammatory fever. It generally comes
on about mid-day, with. fome fymptoms of a cold ftage, and commonly with a con-
fiderable languor and drowflnefs. A hot ftage is foon formed, and becomes more
oonfiderable on thefecond and third day. During this courfe children are liable to
frequent ftartings from their flumbers; and adults, if they are kept in bed, aredif-
pofedto much fweating. On the third day, children are fometimes afledled with
one or tvvoepileptic fits. Towards the end of the third day the eruption commonly
appears. The principal marks by which the chicken-pox maybe diftinguiflied from
the fmall pox are, 1. The appearance, on the fecond or third day of the eruption,
©f that veficle full offerum upon the top of the pock. 2. The cruft, which covers
the
220 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
the pocks on the fifth day; at which time thofe of the fmall-pox are not at the height
of their fuppuration. Foreign medical writers hardly ever mention the name of
the chicken-pox : and the writers ofour ow n country fcarcely mention any thing more
of it than its name. Morton fpeak of it as if hefuppofed it to be a very mild genuine
.fmall-pox. But thefe two diftempers are furely totally different from one another,
not only on account of their different appearances above mentioned, but becaufe
thofe who have had the fmall-pox are capable of being infedted with the chicken-
pox; but thofewho have once had the chicken-pox are not capable ofhaving it again,
though to fuch as have never had this diftemper it feemsas infcdlious as the fmall-
pox. Dr. Heberden wetted a thread in the mod concodted pus-like liquor of the
chicken-pox which he could find; and, after making a flight incifion, it was con-
fined upon the arm of one who had formerly had it; the little wound healed up imme-
diately, and fhowed no figns of any infedtion. From the great fimilitude between the
two difterr.pers, it is probable, that, indead of the fmall-pox, fome perfons have
heen inoculated from the chicken-pox; and that the diftemper which has fuc-
ceeded has been miftaken for the fmall-pox by hady or inexperienced obfervers.
It is apromifing fign, in the palfy, when the patient feels a flight degree of pain-
ful itchinefs in the affedted parts; and, if a fever fhoula arife, it bids fair to cure the
palfy. When the fenfe of feeling remains, there is much more room to hope fora
cure than where it is gone, as well as the power of motion. But when we ohferve-
the flefli to wade, and the fkin to appear withered and dry, we may look upon the
difeafe to be incurable. Convulfions fupervening on a palfy are a fatal fign.
Whenfainting happens in the beginning of any acute diftemper, it is not a good
omen; but., when it takes place in the increafe or at the height of the difeafe, the-
danger is fomewhat lefs; but in general, when fainting comes on without any evi-
dent caufe, it is to be dreaded. In violent haemorrhages it is favourable; as the
bleeding veffels gain time to contradt and recover themfelves, and thus the patient
may efcape. When perfons of a full habit faint through excefs of paffion, they
ought to be bled without delay, and fhould drink vinegar or lemon-juice diluted
with water; and, after the bowels are emptied by a clyder, take a paregoric
draught, and go to bed.
Prognodics from convulfions. Except in fome few cafes, convulfive diforders
are always to be dreaded; butlefs inyoung people than in fuch as areadvancedin life.
Thofe which attack girls underthe age of puberty will generally ceafe on the ap-
pearance of the menfes; and boys havelikewife a chance of being relieved as they
advance in life: but in grown-up people, unlefsthe caufe be very evident, a cure
is hardly to be expected, efpecially after the difeafe has been of long continuance.
The treatment is much the fame with that of epilepfy.
The
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 221
The epilepfy frequently is preceded by a pain in the head, latitude, fome diftur-
bance of the fenfes, unquiet fleep, unufual dread, dimnefs of fight, a noife in the
cars, palpitation of the heart, coldnefs of thejoints ; and in fome there is a fenfa-
tion of formication, or a cold-air, &c. afcending from the lower extremities to-
ward the head. If the epilepfy comes on before the time of puberty, there are
fome hopes of its going off at that time. But it is a bad fign when it attacks
about the twenty-firft year, and ftill worfe if the fits grow more frequent; for
then the animal fun 5lionsare often deftroyed, as well as thofeof the mind, and
the patient become# ftupid and foolifli. Sometimes it will terminate in melan-
choly or madnefs, and fometimes in a mortal apoplexy or palfy. It has fometimes,
however, been obferved that epilepfies have been removed by the appearance of
cutaneous difeafes, as the itch,fmall pox, meafles, &c. therefore, if any of thefe
appear, it may be reckoned a favourable prognoftie.
Signs of a diabetes. —The diabetes firft fliows itfelf by adrinefs of the mouth
and third, white frothy fpittle, and the urine in fomewhat larger quantity than
ufual. A heat begins to be perceived in the bowels, which at firft is a little pun-
gent, and gradually increafes. The thirft continues to augment by degrees, and
the patient by degrees lofes the power of retaining his urine for any length of
time. The raoft fingular phenomenon in this difeafe is, that the urine feems to be
entirely or very much diverted of an animal nature, and to be largely impregna-
ted with a faccharine fait, fcarcely diftinguifhable from that obtained from the
fugar-cane. This difcovery was firft made by Dr. Dobfon of Liverpool, who made
fome experiments on the urine of a perfon labouring under adibetes, who dif-
charged 28 pints of urine every day, taking during the fame time from 12 to 14
pounds only offolid and liquid food. When a perfon perceives any of the before-
mentioned ly mptoms upon him, (particularly the quantity and infipidity of the
urine,) he lliouldlofe no time in taking the proper precautions ; for the diabetes
is rarely cured unlefs when taken at the very beginning, which is feldom done.
Briftol water is reckoned a fpecific in this dil’order.
Hydrophobia. —Thisdifeafe commonly does not make its attacks till aconfidera-
ble time after the bite. In fome few inftances it has commenced in feven or eight
daysfrom the accident, but generally the patient continues in health for twenty,
thirty, or forty, days, or even much longer. The wound, if not prevented, will in
general be healed long before that time, frequently with the greatefteafe ; though
fometimes it refifts all kinds of healing applications, and forms a running ulcer,
which difeharges a quantity of matter for many days. It has been faid, that the
nearer the wounded place is to the falivary glands,the fooner the fymptons of hy-
drophobia appear. The approach of the difeafe is known by the cicatrix of the
No. 15. 3 L wound
222 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
wound becoming high, hard, and elevated, and by a peculiar fenfe of pricking
at the part; pains fnoot from it towards the throat ; fometimes it is furrounded with
livid orred ftre3ks,and feems to be in aftate of inflammation; though frequently
there is nothing remarkable to be obferyed about it. The patient becomes melan-
choly, loves folitude, and has ficknefs at ltomach. Sometimes the peculiar fymp-
tom of the difeafe, the dread of water, comes on all at once. We have an in-
ftatice of one who, having taken a vomit of ipecacuanha for the ficknefs he felt at
his ltomach, was feized with the hydrophobia in the time he was drinking the warm
water. Sometimes the difeafe begins like a common fore throat; and, the forenefs
daily increafing, the hydrophobic fymptoms fliow themfelves like a convulfive
fpafm of the mufeles of the fauces. In others, the mind feems to be primarily
affedted, and they have areal dread of water or any liquid before they try whether
they can fwallow it or not. Dr. James, in hisTreatife on Canine Madnefs, men-
tions a boy fent out to fill two bottles with water, who was fo terrified by the
noife of the liquid running into them, that he fled into the houfe crying out that
he was bewitched. Pie mentions alfo the cafe of a farmer, who going to draw fome
ale from a calk, was terrified to fuch a degree at its running into the velfel, that he
ran out in great hafle with the fpigot in his hand. But, in whatever manner this
fymptom comes on, it is certain that the moft painful fenfations accompany every
attempt to fwallow liquids. Nay, the bare fight of water, of a looking-glafs, of
any thing clear or pellucid, will give the utmoft uneafinefs, or even throw the
patient into convulfions. With regard to the affection of the mind itfelf in this
difeafe, it does not appear that the patients are deprived of reafon. Some have,
merely by the dint of refolution, conquered thedread of water, though they never
could conquer the convulfive motions which the conta6l of liquids occafioned
:
yet even this refolution has been of no avail ; for theconvulfions and other fymp-
toms, increafing, have almoll always deftroyed the unhappy patients. However,
inthis diftemper,the fymptoms are fo various, that they cannot be enumerated;
for we feldom read two cafes of hydrophobia which do not differ very remarka-
bly in this refpeft. When a perfon is bitten, the p.rognofis with regard to the en-
fuing hydrophobia is very uncertain. All thofe who are bit do not fall into the
difeafe; nay, Dr. Vaughan relates that, out of thirty,bitten by a maddog^only
one was feized with the hydrophobia. During the interval betwixt the bite and
the time the difeafe comes on, there are no fymptoms by which we can cer-
tainly judge whether it will appear or not.
Prognoltics ofa clropfy of the breajl. This affe&ion, particularly with refpe6t
to itscaufes, is in many circumllancesfimilar to other kinds ofdropfy, particularly
toafeites. But from the fttuation of the water, which is here depofited inthecavity
of

ofthethorax,itmaynaturally be fuppofed that fome peculiar fymptoms will occur.
Befides the commonfymptomsof dropfy, (palenefsof the countenance, fcarcity of
urine,and the! ike,) this difeafeis, in fome inftances, attended with a fluctuation of
watervvithin the bread; which, when it does occur, may be confidered as a certain
didinguifhing mark of this affeCtion. But, befides this, it is alfo didinguifhed by
theremarkable affections of circulation and refpiration with which it is attended.
The breathing is peculiarly difficult, efpecialty in a recumbent podure ;
and in
manyinftances patients cannot breathewith tolerable eafe, unlefs when fit ting ereCt,
or even (looping fomewhat forward. The pulfe is very irregular, and has often
remarkableintermiffions. But the difeafe has been thought to be principally cha-
racterized by a bidden fhrtingfrom(leep,inconfequenceofanalmoft itiexpreffible
uneafy fenfation referred to the bread, and attended with drong palpitation, which
may probably arife from an affeCtion either of circulation orof refpiration. That
thefe fymptoms are common attendants of this difeafe is undeniable ; and they are
certainly the bed charaCteridics of this affeCtion with which we are yet acquainted:
but it mud be allowed that they are prefent in fome cafes where there is no water in
the bread; and that in other inftances where the difeafe exids, they are either alto-
gether wanting, or occur only to a very flight degree. Certain diagnodics, there-
fore, of this difeafe dill remain to bedifcovered. When hydrothorax is prefent,
from the affeCtion of the vital functions with which it is attended, it may readily be
concluded that it is adangerousdifeafe, and in many indances it proves fatal. The
cure, as far as it can be accompliffied,is obtained verymuch on the fame principles
as in other dropfies. Benefit is often obtained from an artificial difcharge of water
by the application of bliders to the bread : but in this, as well as other dropfies, a
difcharge is chiefly effected by the natural outlets, particularly from the ufeof ca-
thartics and diuretics. In thisfpeciesof dropfy, more perhaps than in any other,
recourfe has been had tothe ufe of the digitalispurpurea, or fox-glove, fo drongly
recommended as a diuretic by Dr. Withering in his Treatife refpeCting the ufe of it.
There can be no doubt that this, though fometimes productive of inconvenience,
from the didreffing ficknefs and fevere vomitingwhich itnot unfrequently excites,
though ufed even but m fmall dofes, often operates as a powerful diuretic, and
produces a complete evacuation of water, after other remedies have failed. From
the effeCls mentioned above, however, as well as from its influence on the pulfe,
which it renders much dower, it is neceffary that it fliould be emploved with great
caution and in fmall dofes. A dram of the dried leaves of the digitalis, macerated
for four hours in half a pint ofwarm water, forms an infufion which may be given
in dofes ofan ounce, and the dried powder ofthe leaves in dofes ofone or two grains :
thefedofesmay begradually increafed,and repeated twice oroftenerin the day,;

Scurvy. The firft indication of the fcorbutic diathefis is generally a change of
colour in the face, from the natural and healthy look to a pale and bloated com-
plexion, with a liftlefihefs, and averfion from every fort of exercife ; the gums
foon after become itchy, fvvell, and are apt to bleed on the flighted; touch ; the
breath grows offenfive ; and the gums, fwelling daily more and more, turn livid,
and at length become extremely fungous and putrid,as b.eing continually in contact
with the external air ; which in every cafe favours the putrefaction of fubftances
difpofed to run into that ftate, and is indeed abfolutely requifltefor the production
ot aCtual rottennefs. The fymptoms of the fcurvy, like thofe of every other dif-
eafe, are fomewhat different in different fubjeCts, according to the variouscircum-
ftances of coilftitution and they do not always proceed in the fame regular courfe
in every patient. But what is very remarkable in this difeafe, notwithftanding the
various and immenfe load of diftrefs under which the patients labour, there is no
flcknefsat the ftomach, the appetite keeps up, and the fenfes remain entire almoft
to the very laft : when lying at reft, they make no complaints, and feel littlediftrefs
or pain ; but the moment they attempt to rife or ftir themfelves, then the breathing
becomes difficult, with a kind of ftraitnefs or catching, and great oppreffton, and
fometimes they have been known to fall into a fyncope. This catching of the
breath upon motion, w'ith the lofs of ftrength, dejeCtion of fpirit, and rotten
gums, are held as the effential or diftinguifhing fymptoms of the difeafe.
Thejaundice firft fhows itfelf by a 1 iftleffnefs and want of appetite : the patient
becomes dull, oppreffed, and generally coftive. Thefe fymptoms have continued
but a very fliort time, w'hen a yellow colour begins to diffufe itfelf over the tunica
albuginea, or white part of the eye, and the nails of the fingers ; the urine becomes
high coloured, with a yellowifli fediment capable of giving a yellow tint to linen ;
the ftools are w'hitifh or grey. In fome there is a molt violent pain in the epigaftric
region, which isconfiderably increafed after meals. In fome the difeafe degenerates
into an incurable dropfv ; and there have been many inftances of people who
have died ofthe dropfy after thejaundice itfelf had been totally removed. The com-
ing on of a gentle diarrhoea, attended with bilious ftools, together with the ceffation
of pain, are figns of the difeafe being cured. We are not, however, always to con-
clude, becaufe thed ifeafe is not attended with acute pain, that it is therefore i ncura-
ble ; for frequently the paffage ofa concretion through the biliary d u6ts is accompa-
nied only with a fenfation of flight uneafinefs. If the difeafe goes off, its return
muft be prevented by a courfe of tonic medicines, particularly the Peruvian bark
and antifepties : but we can by no means becertain that thejaundice will not return,

bladder, and, though one hath paffed, another may very quickly follow, and pro

Stone in the bladder. The figns of aftone in the bladder are, pain, efpecially
about thefphindler; and bloody urine, in confequence of riding or being jolted
in a carriage ; a fenfe of weight in the perinaeum ;
an itchinefs of the glans penis ;
fiimy fediment in the urine; and frequent ftoppages in making water; a tenef-
mus alfo comes on while the urine is difcharged.
Imaginary vifion of objedts which do not exift. This often takes place when-
the body is difeafed, and then the patient is faid to be delirious. Sometimes
however, in thefe cafes, it does not amount to delirium; but the perfon imagines
he fees gnats or other infedts flying before his eyes; or fometimes, that every
thing he looks at has black fpots init, which laft is a very dangerous fign. Some-
times alfo fparksof fire appear before his eyes; which appearances are not.tobe
difregarded, as they frequently precede apoplexy or epilepfy : on the other hand,
it is feared that little benefit can be derived from an attention to this prognoftic,
as the fits commonly follow fo fuddenly.
I (hall now proceed to defcribe two diforders not noted by Culpeper, or any
old writer. And firft of the
ANGINA PECTORIS.
Dr.Heberden was the firft who defcribedthis difeafe, though it is extremely dan-
gerous, and, by his account, not very rare. It feizes thofe who are fubjedt to it
when they are walking, and particularly when they walk foon after eating, with a
moft difagreeable and painful fenfation in the breaft,which feems to threaten imme-
diate deftrudtion: but, the moment they ftand ftill, all the uneafinefs vanifhes. In
all other refpedts the patients at the beginning ofthisdil'order are well, and have no
ftiortnefs of breath; from which the angina pedtoris is totally different. After it
has continued fome months,the fits will not ceafe inftantaneouflyon {landing ftill;
and it will come on not only when the patients are waiking, but when they are
lying down, and oblige them to rife up out of their beds every night for many
months together. In one or two very inveterate cafes, it has been broughton bythe
motion of a horfe or carriage, and even by fwailowing, coughing, going to ftool,
fpeaking, or by any difturbance of mind. The perfcns affedted were all men, al-
moft all ofwhom were above fifty years of age, and moft of them with a ftiort neck

and inclining to be fat. Something like it, however, was obferved in one wo-
man, who was paralytic ; and one or two young men complainedof it in a flight
degree. Other pra&itioners have obferved it in very young perfons. When afit
of this fort comes on by walking, its duration is very fliort, as it goes off almoft
immediately upon flopping. If it comes on in the night, it will laft an hour or
two. Dr. Heberden met with one in whom it once continued for feveral days ;
during all which time the patient feemed to be in imminent danger ofdeath. Moft
of thofe attacked with the diftemper died fuddenly : though this rule was not
without exceptions; and Dr. Heberden obferved one who funk under a lingering
illnefs of a different nature. The osfterni is ufually pointed to as the feat of this
malady ; but it feems as if it was under the lower part of that bone, and at other
times under the middle or upper part, but always inclining more to the left fide .
and in many cafes there is joined with it a pain about the middle of the left-
arm, which appears to be feated in the biceps nmfcle.
The appearance of Dr. Heberden ’s paper in the Medical Tranfadtions very foon
raifed the attention of the faculty,and produced other obfervationsfrom phyficians
of eminence; namely. Dr. Fothergill, Dr. Wall of Worcefter, Dr. Haygarth of
Chefter, and Dr. Percivalof Manchefter. Italfo induced an unknown fufferer to
writeDr. Heberden avery fenfible letter,defcribing his feelings in the moft natural
manlier ;
which unfortunately, in three weeks after the date of this anonymous
epiftle, terminated in afudden death, as the writerhimfelf had apprehended. The
youngeftfubjedt that Dr. Fothergill ever faw afflidted with this diforder was about
thirty years ofage; and this perfon wascured. Themethod thatfucceeded with him
was a courfeof pills, compofed of the mafs of gum-pill, foap, and native cinnabar,
with a light chalybeate bitter: this was continued for fome months, after which he
went to Bath feveral fucceffive feafons, and acquired his ufual health: he was or-
deredto be very fparinginhisdiet; to keep the bowels open; and to ufe moderate
exercife on horfeback, but not to take long or fatiguing walks. The only fymp-
tom in this patient that is mentioned, was a ftridlure about the cheft, which came
on if he was walking up hill or a little falter than ordinary, or if he was riding a
very brifk trot ; for moderate exercife of any kind did not affedl him : and this un-
eafy fenfation always obliged him to flop, as he felthimfelf threatened with imme-
diate death if he had continued to go forwards. It is the fharp conftridlive pain
acrofs the cheft, that (according to Dr. Fothergill’s obfervation j
particularly marks
this fingular difeafe ; and which is apttofuperveneupon a certain degree ofmufcu-
lar motion, or whatever agitates the nervous fyftem. In fuch cafes as fell under the
infpedtion ofDr. Fothergdl, he very feldom met with one that was not attended with
an irregular and intermitting pulfe j and this, not only during the exacerbations,

but often when the patient was free from pain and at reft ;
but Dr. Heberden ob-
ferves, that the pulfe is, atleaft fometimes, not difturbed ;
and mentions his having
once had an opportunity of being convinced of this circumftance, by feeling the
pulfe during the paroxyfm. But no doubt thefe varieties, as well as many other
little circumftances, will occur in this difeafe, as they do in every other, on account
of the diverfity ofthehuman frame; and, if thofe which in general are found to
predominate and give the diftinguifliingcharadter be prefent, they will alwaysau-
thorife us in giving the name to the difeafe: thus, when we find the conftric-
tory pain acrofs the cheft, accompanied withafenfe of ftrangling or fuffocation;
and fitill more, if this pain fhould ftrike acrofs the breaft into one or both arms,
we fhould not hefitate to pronounce the cafe an angina pedtoris.
As to the nature of this difeafe, it appears to be purely fpafmodic : and this opi-
nion will readily prefent itfelf to anyone who confiders the fudden manner of its
coming on and going off; the long intervals of perfedteafe; the relief afforded by
wine and foirituous cordials; the influence which paffionate affedtions of the mind
haveover it; the eafe which comes from varying the poftureofthe head andfhoul-
ders,or from remainingquite motionlefs ; the number ofyears for which it willcon-
tinue,without other wife difordering health ; its bearing fo well the motion ofa horfe
or carriage, which circumftance often diftinguithes fpafmodic pains from thofe
which arifefroin ulcers; and laftly, its coming on for the moft part after a lull meal,
and in certain patients at night, juft after the firftfleep, at whichtimethe incubus,
convulfiveafthma, and other ills, juftly attributed to the difordered fundtions of
the nerves, are peculiarly apt to return or to be aggravated.. From all thefe cir-
cumftances taken together, therecan belittledoubtthat thisaffedtion isof a fpafmo-
dic nature : but, though this fhould be admitted, it may notbefoeafy to afcertainthe
particular mufcles which are thusaffedted. The violent fenfe of ftrangling or choak-
mg which lhows the circulation through the lungs to be interrupted during the
height ofthe paroxyfm; and the peculiar conftridtive pain under the fternum, al-
waysinclining (accordingto Dr. Heberden’s obfervation) to theleft fide; together
with that moft diftrefling and alarming fenfation, which, if it were to increafe or con-
tinue, threatens an immediate extindtion of life; might authorife us to conclude
that the heartitfelf is the mufcle affedted : the only objedtion to this idea (and,if it had
been conftantly obferved,it would be infurmountable) is,that the pulfe is not always
interruptedduringthe paroxyfm. The appearances in two ofthediffedtions favour
the opinion that the fpafm affedts the heart; as in onefubjedt the left ventricle (and,
though it be not mentioned, v\e may prefume the right one alfo) was found as empty
ofblood as if it had been walhed; and in another, the fubftance ofthe heart appeared
whitifh, not unlike a ligament; as it fhould feem, in both cafes, from the force
of
*28 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
ofthe fpafm fqueezing the blood out from the veffels and cavities. If this hypothecs
be allowed, we muft conclude that the fpafm can only take place in an inferior de-
gree, as long as the patient continues to furvive the paroxyfm ;fince an affection of
this fort, and in this part, of any confiderable duration or violence, muft inevitably
prove fatal : and accordingly, as far as could be traced, the perfons who have been
known tolabour under this difeafehave in general died fuddenly. The diffeCtions
alfo fhow,that, whatever may be the true feat ofthe fpafm, itis not neceffary forthe
bringing of it on, that the heart, or its immediate appendages, fliould bein a mor-
bid ftate; for, in three out of the fix that have as yet been made public, thefe parts
were found in a found ftate. On opening the body of the gentleman who wrote
the letter to Dr. Heberden,“ upon themoft careful examination, no manifeftcaufe
of his death could be difcovered ; the heart, in particular, with its veffels and valves,
were all found in a natural condition.” In the cafe communicated by Dr. Percival
to the publdhers of the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, “ the heart and aorta
defcendens were found in a found ftate.” And inDr. Haygarth’s patient, on open-
ing the thorax, the lungs, pericardium, and heart, appeared perfectly found.
Not to mention Dr. Fothergill’s patient (R.M.), in whofe body the only morbid
appearance about the heart was a fmall white fpot near the apex. So that the
caufe, whatever its nature might have been, was at too great a diftance, or of too
fubtle a nature, to come under the infpeCtion of the anatomift. But there was
a cjrcumftance in two of the fubjeCts that is worthy of remembrance; and which
ftiowsthat the crafts of the blood, while they were living, muft have been great-
ly injured, namely, its not coagulating, but remaining of a cream-like confiftence,
without any feparation into ferum and craftamentum.
From all that we have feen hitherto publilhed, it does not appear that any confi-
derable advances have been made towards the aCltial cure of this anomalous fpafm.
The very judicious and attentive Dr. Heberden (to whom the public are highly in-
debted for firft making the diforder known) confeffes, that bleeding, vomits, and
other evacuations, have not appeared to do any good: wine and cordials, taken at
bed-time, will fometimes preventor weakenthe fits ; butnothingdoesthis fo effec-
tually as opiates: in fliort.the medicines ufually called nervous or cordial, fuch as
relieve and quiet convullive motions, and invigorate the languiftiing principle of
life, are what he recommends. Dr. Wall mentions one patient, out of the twelve
orthirteen that hehadfeen, who applied to him early in the difeafe,and was relieved
confiderably by the ufe of antimonial medicinesjoined with the fetid gums: he was
ftill livingat the time that the doCtor wrote his paper (Nov. 1772), and going about
with tolerable eafe. Two were carried off by other diforders; all the reft died fud-
denly. Dr. Fothergill’s directions are chiefly calculated with the view to prevent the
diforder

diforder from gaining ground, and to alleviate prefent diftrefs. Accordingly lie
enjoins fuch a kind of diet as may be moft likely to prevent irritability : in particu-
lar not to eat voracioufly : to be ftridtly abftemious in refpedt to every thing
heating j fpices, fpirits, wines, and all fermented liquors: to guard moft fcrupu-
loufly againft paffion,or any vehement emotions; and to make ufe ofall the ufual
means ofeftablifhingand prelervinggeneral health; to mitigate exceffes of irritabi-
lity by anodynes ;
or pains, if they quicken thecirculation : todifperfe flatulencies,
when they diftendthe ftomach, bymoderate dofes of carminatives ;
amongft which,
perhaps, Ample peppermint-water may be reckoned one of the fafeft. But, fince
obefity isjuftly confidered as aprincipal predifpoflng caufe, he infifts ftrongly on
theneceffity of preventing an increafe of fat, by a vegetable diet, and uflng every
other practicable method of augmenting thethinner fecretions. Thefe were the
only means which occurred to the Englifli phyficians of oppofing this formidable
difeafe.—In myown praCtice I have neverknown the Solar TinCture to fail in remo-
ving by degrees this dangerous diforder. The cafes indeed that have occurred to
me have been very few; and my uniform practice has been to order a wine-glafs of
the TinCture, diluted with water, to be taken at going to bed ; and, in thofe where
the diforder had gained great afcendency, I prefcribed a like quantity to be take
at getting up in the morning, at leaft an hour before breakfaft. This has always
rendered the attacks lefs violent,and at lall totally removed them. Two table-
fpoonfuls of the TinCture undiluted fliould be adminiftered, if poflible, during
the height of theparoXyfm, which will generally give immediate eafe.
Dr. Smyth of Ireland has, we are told, difcovered that the angina peCtoris may
be certainly cured byiftues, of which Dr. Macbride gives the following inftance :
“ A. B. a tall well-made man ; rather large than otherwife : of healthy parents,
except that there had been a little gout in the family ;
temperate ;
being very atten-
tive to the bufinefs of his trade, (that of a watch-maker,) led a life uncommonly fe~
dentary ;
had, from his boyhood upwards, been remarkably fubjeCtto alarming
inflammations of his throat, which feizedhim at leaft once in the courfe ofthe year;
in all other refpedts well. In 1767, (then forty-eight years of age,) he was taken,
without any evident caufe, withafudden and very difpiriting throbbing under the
Iternum. It foon afterwards increafed, and returned uponhim every third or fourth
week, accompanied with great anxiety,very laborious breathing, choakiug, a fen-
fation offulnefsand diftenfion in the head,bloated and fluflied countenance,turgid
and wateryeyes,and a veryirregular andunequal pulfe. The paroxylm invadedhim
almoftconftantly while he was fitting after dinner ; nowand thenhe wT

himtofitup,asitwasthenattendedwithnogreatdifficulty in breathing. I11 the af-
ternoon fits, his greateft eafe was from the lupine pofture ;
in which he ufed to conti-
nue motionlefs for fome hours, until, quite fpent and worn out with anguilli, he
dropt into a {lumber. In the intervals between thefe attacks, which at length grew
fo frequent as to return every fourth or fifth day, he was, to appearance in perfe6I
health. Thus matters continuedfor more than two years ; and various antifpafmodic
were inefie6lually tried for his relief. In 1769, there fupervened a very Iharpcon-
ftri&ory painat the upperpartofthefternum,ftretching equally on each fide.atten-
ded with the former lymptoms of anxiety, dyfpnoea,choaking, &c. and with an ex-
cruciating cramp, as he called it, that could be covered with a crown- piece, in each
ofhis arms, between the elbow and the vvrift,exa6ily at the infertion of the pronator
teres ; the reft of the limb was quite free. The fits were fometimes brought on, and
always exafperated,by any agitation of mind or body.Heonce attempted to ride on
horfeback duringthe paroxyfm: but the experiment was nearprovingfatal to him.
Thedifferenceoffeafon or weather made no impreftion upon him. Still, intheinter-
vals, his health was perfe6tly good ; except that his eyes, which before his illnefs
were remarkably ftrong and clear, were nowgrown extremely tender; and thathis
fight was much impaired. He had no flatulency of ftomach, and his bowels were
regular. In this fituation,Feb. 22, 1770, he applied to me for afiiftance. I had feen
I believe, eight or ten of thefe frightful cafes before. Two of the patients dropt
dead fuddenly. They were men between forty and fifty years of age, and of a
makefomewhatflefhy. The fate oftheotherslwas not informed of; or, at leaft,can-
not now recolledfc. Having found the total inefficacy of blifters and the whole clafis
of nervous medicines in the treatment of this anomalous fpafim, I thought it right
to attempt the corredling or draining off of the irritating fluid in the cafe now
before us. To this purpole, I ordered a mixture of lime-water with a little of the
compound juniper-water, and an alterative proportion of Huxham’s antimonial
wine: I put the patient on a plain, light, perfpirable, diet; and reftrained him
from all vifcid, flatulent, and acrimonious, articles. By purfuing this courfe, he
was foon apparently mended ;
but, after he had perfifted regularly in it for at leaft
two months, he kept for fome time at a ftand. I then ordered a large iffue to be
opened on each of his thighs. Only one was made. However, as foon as it be-
gan to difcharge, he amended. The frequency and feverityof the fits abated
confiderably ; and he continued improving gradually, until, at the end of eigh-
teen months, he was reftored to perfedt health ; which he has enjoyed, without the
leaft interruption, till now, except when he has been tempted (perhaps once in a
twelvemonth) to tranfgrefs rules, by making a large mealonfalted meat, or indul-
ging himfelf in ale or rum-punch, each of which never failed to diforder him from
the*
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. ijr
the beginning ofhis illnefs: but even on thefe occafions, he has felt no-more than the
flighted motion of his former fufferings ; infomuch that he would defpifethe attack,
if it did not appear to be of the fame dock with his old complaint. No other caufe
has had the lead ill effe6t on him. Though rum was conftantly hurtful, yet,
punch, made with a maceration of black currants in our vulgar corn-fpirit, is a
liquor that agrees remarkably well with him. He never took any medicine after
the iffue began to difcharge; and I have directed that it fliall be kept open as long
as he lives. The inflammations of his throat have difappeared for five years
pad; he has recovered the drength and clearnels ofhis fight; and his health feerns
now to be entirely re-edablifhed.”
Dr. Macbride, in a letter to Dr. Duncan, publiflied in the Edinburgh Medical
Commentaries, gives the following additional obfervations on this difeafe:
“ Within thele few weeks I have, at the defire ofDr. Smyth, vifited, three or four
times, a very ingenious man who keeps an academy in this city, of about thirty-
four years of age, who applied to the dodtor for his advice in January laft. I fliall
give you his fymptoms as I had them from his own mouth, which appear to me to
mark his cafe to be an angina pedtoris, and as deplorable as any that I have read
of. It was ftrongly diftinguiflied by the exquifite condridtory pain of the fternum,
extending to each of his arms as far as the infertion of the deltoid mufcle,extreme
anxiety, laborious breathing, (Iran gling, and violent palpitation ofthe heart, witha
moft irregular pulfe, Theparoxyfms vverefofrequent,thathefcarcely everefcaped
a day, for fix or feven years, without one. They were ufually excited by any agi-
tation of mind or body, though flight. He had clear intervals of health between
the fits. The didemperfeems hereditary in him, as he fays his father was affedled
in the fame manner fome years previous to his death. He lias a ftronggouty taint,
which never fhowed itfelf in his limbs; and he has led a life of uncommonfedenta-
rinefs,fromintenfe application tomathematicalftudies,attentionof mind.andpaifion,
even from his boyilh years. Thefe circumdances may, perhaps, account for his
having been taken with this difeafe at fo early anageasfeventeen. A large ilfuewas
immediately opened on each ofhis thighs. In a month afterwards he began to mend,
and has gone on improving gradually. He can now run up flairs brifkly, as I favv
him do no later than yefterday, without hurt; can bear agitation of mind; and has
no complaint, excepting a flight oppredion ofthe bread, under the fternum,which
he feels fometimes in a morning, irprpediately after dr-effing himfelf, and which he
thinks is brought on by the motion ufed inputting on his clothes; though, fora
complete week preceding the day on which I law him laft, he told me that he had
been entirely free from all uneafinefs, and was exulting that he had not had fuch
an interval of eafe for thefe laft feven years. Dr. Smyth alfo fhowed me, in his
adverfaria, or note-book, the cafe of a gentleman who had been under his care
in
232 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
in 1760, which he had forgotten when my book went to the prefs, but which hewas
remindedofthe other day by a vifitfrom his patient. It was a genu ineangina pedloris,
brought on by a fedentary life, and great vexation of mind, clearly marked by the
exquifite pain under the flernum, that extended acutely to the upper extremities,
particularly along the left arm,togetherwiththe other fymptomsofdyfpno2a,anxie-
ty,palpitation ofthe heart, &c. recited in thecafe above. The diforder went off in
1762, by large fpontaneous difcharges from the piles, but returned upon him fe-
verely in 1765. Iflues in his thighs were then recommended to him, but notmade.
But, whether it was by the perfuafion offome friend, or of his own accord, he went
into a courfe of James’s powder, infmall alterative dofes,combined with a little
caflor and afafoetida. This he perfifled in for about fix weeks; in the mean while,
he had large acrimonious gleetitigs from the fcrotum, and a plentiful difcharge
of ichor from the anus.—From this time he began to find his complaints grow lefs
and lefs di fireffing, and he has now been totally free from them for fix years pafl.”
STRAITNESS of the CESOPHAGUS.
This diflemper has been treated of only byDr. Munckley, who reckons itone of
themoft deplorable difeafes ofthe human body. Its beginning is in general fo flight
as obefcarcelyworth notice, the patients perceivingonly afmall imped imenttothe
fwallowingoffolid food: they ufually continue in this flat e for many months; du-
ring which, all liquid foods, and even folids themfelves when cut fmall and fwal-
lowed leifurely,are gotdown withoutmuch difficulty : by degrees theevil increafes,
and the paffage through the oefophagus becomes fo narrow, that not the fmallefl
folid whatever can pafs through it; but, after having been detained for fome time
at the part where the obflacleis formed, is returned again with a hollow noife ofa
very peculiar kind, and with the appearance ofconvulfion. The feat of this malady
is fometimes near thetop ofthe oefophagus, and atother times farther down, nearer
thefuperior orifice ofthe ftomach. In this laft cafe, the part of the alimentary tube
which is above the obftrudlion is frequently fo dilated by the food which is detained
in it as to be capable of containing a large quantity; and the kind ofvomiting, by
which it is again returned through the mouth, comes on fooner or later after the at-
tempt to fwkllow, in proportion to the nearnefs or remotenefs of the part affected.
In the laft flageof thisdifeafe, notevenliquidsthemfelvescanbefwallowedfo as to
pafs into t heflomach, aua the patient dies literally ftarved to death. On the diflec-
tion offuchas have died in this manner, the esfophagus isfound to be considerably
thickened ;
and in fome fo contra-6ted within at the difeafed part, as fcarcely to
admit the paffing of a common probe; in others, to adhere together in fuch a

and the occult sciences.
manner as entirelyto elofe up the paffage, and not to be feparated without great diffi-
culty. He comes next to fliow what he has found to be the moft efficacious method
of treating this difeafe, which, though not uncommon, yet in general has been eon-
fidered as incurable. He claims not the merit of having difcovered the method of
cure, but hopes that fome fervicemay arife from pubhffiing what his experience has
confirmed to him; having firft received the hint from another eminent phyfician.
The only medicine, then, from the ufe of which he has ever found any fervice, is mer-
cury; and in cafes which are recent, and where the fymptoms have not rifen to any
great height, fmall dofes of mercury given every night, and prevented, by purga-
tive medicines, from affedting the mouth, have accompliffied the cure. But where
thecomplainthas been of long (landing, and thefymptom has come on of the food’s
being returned through the mouth, a more powerful method of treatment becomes
neceffary. In this cafe he has never found any thing of the lead avail in removing
any of the fymptoms but mercury ufed in fuch a manner as to raife a gentle but
eondant fpitting : and this method he has purfued with the happied fuccefs. If
this method be commenced before the complaint has gained too much ground upon
the conditution, the cafe is not to bedefpaired of ;
and, of thofewho have come un-
der his care in this date, by much the greater part have received copfiderable benefit
from ft, and man)'- have been entirely cured. The complaint itfelf, he obferves, is*
not ve'ry uncommon ;
but there is no indance, to his knowledge, recorded, of fuc-
eefs from any other manner of treating it than that he has recommended.
OBSERVATIONS on the MEANS of PRESERVING HEALTH.
I. Rules for the Management of Valetudinarians.
That part ofthe medical fyftem which lays down rules for the prefervationofheaiih:
and prevention ofdifeafes, termed Hygeine, is not to be dridtly underdood as if it
refpedted only thofe people who enjoy perfedt health, and who are under no appre-
henfions of difeafe, for fuch feldom either defire or attend to medical advice ; but
(hould rather be confideredas relating to valetudinarians, or to fuch as, though not
adtually fiek, may yet have fufficient reafon to fear that they will foon become fo :
hence it is that the rules mud be applied to corredt morbific difpofitions, and to ob-
viate the various things that are known to be the remote or poffible caufes of dif-
eafes. From the way in which the feveral temperaments are ufually mentioned by
fyftematic writers, it (liould feem as if they meant that every particular conditution
mud be referred to one or other of the four; but this is far from being reducible to
pradtice, finceby much the greater number of people have conditutions fo indif—
tindtly marked, that it is hard to fay to which of the temperaments they belong.
No, 15; .
3 O When;
*34 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
When we a&ually meet with particular perfons who have evidently either, i. Too
much ftrength and rigidity of fibre, and too much fenfibility ; 2. Too little ftrength,
and yet too much fenfibility ; 3. Too much ftrength, and but little fenfibility ; or,
4. But little fenfibility joined to weaknefs;—we fhould look on fuch perfons as
more or lefs in the valetudinary ftate, who require that thefe morbific difpofitions
be particularly watched, left they fall into thofe difeafes which are allied to the
different temperaments.
People of the firft-mentioned temperament being liable to fuffer from continued
fevers, efpeeially of the inflammatory fpecies, their fcheme of preferving healih
fhould confift in temperate living, with refpebt both to diet and exercife ; they
fliould ftudioufly avoid immoderate drinking, and be remarkably cautious left any
of the natural difcharges be checked. People of this habit bear evacuations well,
efpeeially bleeding: they ought not, however, to lofe blood but when they really
require to have the quantity leffened ; becaufe too much of this evacuation would
be apt to reduce the conftitution to the fecond-mentioned temperament, wherein
ftrength is deficient, but fenfibility redundant.
Perfons of the fecond temperament are remarkably prone to fuffer from painful
and fpafmodic difeafes, and are eafily ruffled; and thofe of the fofter fex who have
this delicacy of habit are very much difpofed to hyfterical complaints. The fcheme
here fhould be, to ftrengthen the folids by moderate exercife, cold bathing, the Pe-
ruvian bark, and chalybeate-waters; particular attention fliould conftantly be had
to the ftate of the digeftive organs, to prevent them from being overloaded with
any fpecies of faburra which might engender flatus, or irritate thefenfible mem-
branes of the fto nachand inteftines, from whence the diforder would foon be com-
municated to the whole nervous fyftem. Perfons of this conftitution fhould never
take any of the draftic purges, nor ftrong emetics ; neither fhould they lofe blood
but in cafes of urgent necefflty. But a principal fhareof management, in thefe ex-
tremely-irritable confutations, confifts in avoiding all fudden changes of every fort,
efpeeially thofe with refpedl to diet and clothing, and in keeping the mind as much
as poflible in a ftate of tranquillity. Hence the great advantages which people of
this frame derive from the ufe of medicinal waters drunk on the fpot, becaufe of
that freedom from care and ferious bufinefs of every kind which generally obtains
in all the places laid out for the reception of valetudinarians.
The third-mentioned temperament, where there is an excefs of ftrength and but
little fenfibility, does not feem remarkably prone to any diltreffmg or dangerous
fpecies of difeafe; and thereforeit can hardly befuppofed that perfons fo circum-
ftanced
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. "35
{lanced willeitherof themfelves think of any particular fcheme of management, or
have recourfe to the faculty for their inftrudtions: fuch conftitutions, ho wever, we
may obf'-rve, bear all kinds of evacuations well, and fometimes require them to
prevent an over-fulnefs, which might end in an oppreffion of the brain or fome
other organ of importance.
But the fourth temperament, where we have weaknefs joined to want of fenfibi-
iity, is exceedingly apt to fall into tedious and dangerous difeafes, arifing from a
defedt of abforbent power in the proper fets of veffels, and from remiffnefs of the
circulation in general; whence corpulency, dropfy, jaundice, and different degrees
of fcorbutic affedtion. In order to prevent thefe, or any other fpecies of accumula-
tion and depravation of theanimalfluids, the people of this conftitution fhould ufe
a generous courfeof diet with brifk exercife, and be careful that none of thefecre-
tions be interrupted, nor any of the natural difcharges fuppreffed. Thefe conftitu-
tions bear purging well, and often require it; as alfo the ufe of emetics, which are
frequently found neceffary to fupply the place of exercife, by agitatingthe abdo-
minal vifcera, and are of fervice to prevent the ftagnation of bile, or the accumula-
tion of mucous humours, which hinder digeftion, and clog the firft paflages. The
free ufe of muftard, horfe-raddifh,and the like fort of ftimulafcingdietetics, is fervice-
able in thefe torpid habits.
When the general mafs of fluids is accumulated beyond what is conducive to the
perfedtion of health, there arifes what the writers term a plethora, which may prove
the fource of different difeafes ; and therefore, when this over-fulnefs begins to pro-
duce languor and oppreffion, care ftiould be taken in time to reduce the body to a
proper ftandard, by abridging the food and increaftngthe natural difcharges, ufing
more exercife, and indulging lefs in fleep. But in oppofite circumftances, where the
fluids have been exhaufted, we are to attempt the prevention of further wafte by
the ufe of ftrengthening ftomachics, a nourifhing diet, and indulgence from fa-
tigue of body or mind. Vitiated fluids are to be confidered as affedted either
with the different kinds of general acrimony, or as betraying figns of fome of the
fpecies of morbific matter which give rife to particular difeafes, fuch as gout,
rhenmatifm, calculus, fcurvy, &c.
During the ftate of infancy, we may fometimes obferve a remarkable acidity,
which not only fhows itfelf in the firft paffages, but alfo feems to contaminate the
general mafs of fluids. As it takes its rife, however, from weak bowels, our views,
when we mean to prevent the ill confequences, muft be chiefly diredted toftrength-
en the digeftive organs, as on their foundnefs the preparation of good chyle depends
;
and hence fmall dofes of rhubarb and chalybeates (either the natural chalybeate wa-
ters

ters mixed with milk, or the llores martiales in dofesof a few grains, according to
the age of the child) are to be adminiftered ; andthediet is to be fo regulated as not
to add to this acid tendency : brilk exercife is likewife to be enjoined, with fridtions
on the ftomach, belly, and lower extremities.
Where the fluids tend to the putrefcent ftate, which fhows itfelf by fetid breath,
fponginefs and bleeding of the gums, a bloated look and livid call, the diet then
fhould be chiefly of frefli vegetables and ripe fruits, with wine in moderation, britk
exercife, and ftrengthening bitters.
•
Where acrimony fhows itfelf by itching eruptions, uncommon third, and flulh-
ing heats, nothing will anfwer better than fuch fulphureous waters as the Harrow-
gate and Moffat in Britain, or the Lucan Swadlimbar in Ireland; at the fame time
ufing a courfe of diet that fhall be neither acrid nor heating.
So far with refpedtto thofe kinds of morbific matter which do not invariably pro-
duce a particular fpecies of difeafe: but there are others of a fpecific nature,fome of
which are generated in the body fpontaneoufly, and feetn to arife from error in diet,
or other circumflances of ill management with refpedt to the animal economy: and
hence it is fometimes poffible, in fome degree if not altogether, to prevent the ill
confequences. Thus, there are inftances where returnsof the gout have been pre-
vented by adhering flri6tly to a milk-diet.
The rheumatifm has alfo been fometimes warded off by wearing a flannel fhirt,
or by ufing the cold bath without interruption.
Calculus may be retarded in its progrefs, and prevented from creating much dif-
trefs, by the internal ufe of foap and lime-water, by foap lees taken in milk or in veal-
broth, or by the ufe of aerated alkaline water, which may perhaps be confidered as
being both more fafe and more efficacious, and at the fame time more pleafant, than
any of the other pra6tices. ^
The fcurvy may be prevented by warm clothing and perfeverance in brifk exer-
cife, by drinking wine or cider; and eating freely of fuch vegetable fubftances as
can be had in thole fituations where this difeafe is moft apt to lhow itfelf.
In conftitutions where there is. an hereditary difpofition to thefcrofula, if early
precautions be taken to ftrengthen- the folids by cold bathing, a nouriffiing courfe
of diet, and moderate ufe of wine, the acrimony which rifes to the difeafe will pro-
bably be prevented from producing any very bad effects.
The. other kinds of morbific matter, which are of the fpecific nature,are received
into the body by infection or contagion.
The inflexion of a putrid fever or dyfentery is bell prevented by immediately
taking an emetic on thefirft attacks of the ficknefsor ffiivering; and, if that do not
completely anfwer, let a large blifter be applied between the ffioulders: by this
method

method the nurfes and other attendants on the tick in the naval hofpitals have often
been preferved. As to other infectious morbific matter, we mult refer to what
has already been faid when treating of hydrophobia, poil'ons, &c.
The ill effects which may arile from the different fpecies of laburra, are to be ob-
viated, in general, by the prudent adminiftration of emetics, and carefully abftain-
ing from fuch kinds of food as are known to caufe the accumulation of noxious
matters in the firft paffages.
Crude vegetables, milk, butter, and other oily fubftances, are to be avoided by
perfons troubled with a fournefs in theftomach; brilk exercife, efpecially riding,
is to be ufed, and they are to refrain from fermented liquors : the common drink
fhould be pure water ;
or water with a very little of lome ardent fpirit, fuch as rum
or brandy. Seltzer and Vahls water are to be drunk medicinally ;
and aromatic bit-
ters, infufions, or ti natures, with the acid elixir of vitriol, from 10 to 20 drops,
will be found ferviceable, in order to ftrengthen the fibres of the ftomach, and pro-
mote the expulfion of its contents, thereby preventing the too hafty fermentation of
the alimentary jnixture. In order to procure immediate relief, magnefia alba, or
creta prreparata, will feldom fail; the magnefia, as well as the chalk, maybe
made into lozenges, with a little fugar and mucilage ;
and in that form may be
carried about and taken occafionally by people afflicted with the acid faburra
In conftitutions where there is an exuberance or ftagnation of bile, and a trouble-
fome bitternels in the mouth, it is neceffary to keep the bowels always free by ta-
king occafionally fmall dofes of pure aloes, oleum ricini, cream of tartar, lome of
the common purging falts, or the natural purging waters.
When there is a tendency to the empyreumatic and rancid faburra, people fflould
carefully avoid all the various kinds of thole oily and high-feafoned things generally
termed madc-dijhes, and eat plain meat, without rich fauces or much gravy; and
in thefe cafes the moft proper drink is pure water.
II. Rules for thofe who enjoy perfect Health.
There can be no doubt that, in general, temperance is the true foundation of
health ;
and yet the ancient phyficians, as we may fee in the rules laid down by
Celfus, did not fcruple to recommend indulgence now and then, and allowed peo-
ple to exceed both in eating and drinking : but it is fafer to proceed to excefs in
drink than in meat; and, if the debauch fhould create any extraordinary or diftreffing
degree of pain or ficknels, and a temporary fever fhould enlue, there are two ways
of fhakingitoff, either to lie in bed and encourage perfpiration, or to get on horfe-

A KEY TO PHYSIC,
back, and by brifk exercife reftore the body to its natural ftate. The choice of thefe
two methods muft always be determined by the peculiar circumftancesof the parties
concerned, and from the experience which dfrey may before have had, which
agrees beft with them.
If a perfon fhould commit excels in eating, efpeciallv of high-feafoned things,
with rich fauces, a draught of cold wr
ater* acidulated with vitriolic acid, will take
off the fenfe of weight at the ftomach, and affift digeftion, by moderating and keep-
ing within bounds the alimentary fementation, and thus preventing the generation
of too much flatus. The luxury of ices may be here of real fervice at the tables of
the great, as producing fimilar effects with the cold water acidulated. Perfons in
thefe circumftances ought not to lay themfelves down to deep, but fhould keep up
and exercife until they are fenfible that the ftomach is unloaded, and that they no
longer feel any oppreflive weight about the praecordia.
If a man be obliged to faft, he ought, if poflible, during that time, to avoid la-
borious work : after differing fevere hunger, people ought not at once to gorge and
fill themfelves ;
nor is it proper, after being over-filled, to enjoin an abfolute faff
:
neither is it fafe to refttotally immediately after exceffive labour, nor fuddenly fall
hard to w'ork after having been long without motion : in a word, all changesJkould
be made by gentle degrees ; for, though the confutation of the human body be fuch
that it can bear many alterations and irregularities without much danger, yet, when
the tranfitions are extremely fudden, they cannot fail of producing fome kind or
degree of diforder.
It is alfo the advice of Celfus to vary the fcenes of life, and not confine ourfelves
to any fettled rules : but as inafition renders the body weak and liftlefs, and exercife
gives vigour and ftrength, people fhould never long omit riding, walking, or go-
ing abroad in a carriage ;
fencing, playing at tennis, dancing, or other fimilar en-
gagements, -which afford both exercife and amufement, as each {hall be found moft
agreeable or convenient, are to be ufed in their turns, according to the circumftan-
ces and tendency to any particular fpecies ofdifeafe. But, when the weaknefs of old
age {hall have rendered the body incapable of all thefe, then dry friaions with the
flefli-brufh will be extremely requifite to preferve health, by accelerating the flow
ofhumours through the fmalleft orders of veffels, and preventing the fluids from
ftagnating too long in the cellular interftices ot the flelhy parts.
Sleep is the great reftorer of firength ;
for, during this time, the nutritious par-
ticles appear to be chiefly applied to repair the wafte, and replace thofe that have
been abraded and walhed off by the labour and exercife of the day. But too much
indulgence in deep has many inconveniences, both with refpea to body and mind,
as it blunts the lenfes, and encourages the fluids to ftagnate in the cellular mem-
brane;
*
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 239
brane ;
whence corpulency, and its necessary confequences, languor and weak-
ness. The proper time for deep is the night feafon, when darknefs and filence
naturally bring it on : therefore day-deep, in general, is not fo refreihing ;
and to
fome people is really diftrelsful, as creating an unufual giddinefs and languor,
efpecially in perfons addifted to literary purluits. Cuftom, however, frequently
renders deep in the day necelfary ;
and in thole conftitutions where it is found
to give real refrelhment it ought to be indulged.
With regard to the general regimen of diet, it has always been held as a rule,
tfiat the fofter and milder kinds of aliment are moft proper for children and
younger lubjeCts ;
that grown perfons fhould eat what is more fubftantial ;
and
old people lelfen their quantity of folid food, and increafe that of their drink.
Of FIXED AIR as a Medicine.
THE antifeptic qualities of fixed air, or as it is now more generally called of the
aerial or carbonic acid gas, have introduced it as a medicine in cafes of putrid
diforders, and various other complaints. —Dr. Percivalobferves, that, though fatal
ifinfpiredinaverylarge quantity, it may in fmaller quantities be breathed without
danger or uneafinefs. And it is a confirmation of this conctufion, that at Bath,
where the waters copioufly exhale this mineral fpirit, the bathers infpire it with im-
punity. At Buxton alfo, where the bath is in a clofe vault, the effects of fuch ef-
fluvia, if noxious, muft certainly be perceived.
Encouraged by thefe and fome other confiderations, he adminiftered fixed air
in more than 30 cafes of the phthifis pulmonalis, by directing his patients to infpire
the fteams of an effervefcing mixture of chalk and vinegar through the fpout of a
coffee-pot. The hectic fever has in feveral in-fiances been confiderably abated, and
the matter expectorated has become lefs offenfive and better digefted. Hewas not
however, fo fortunate in any one cafe as to effeCt a cure ;
although the ufe c£
this air was accompanied with proper internal medicines. But Dr. With-
ering was more fuccefsful. One phthifical patient under his care, by fuch a
courfe, entirely recovered ;
another was rendered much better; and a third, whole
cafe was truly deplorable, fqpmed to be kept alive by it more than two months. It
may be proper to obferve, that fixed air can only be employed with any prolpect of
fuccefs in the latter ftages of the phthifis pulmonalis, when a purulent expectoration
takes place. After the rupture and dilcharge of vomica alfo, fuch a remedy pro-
mifes to be a powerful palliative. Antifeptic fumigations and vapours have been
long employed, and much extolled, in cafes of this kind. The following experi-
ment
<240 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
meat was made to determine whether their efficacy in any degree depends on the
reparation of fixed air from their fubftance.
One end of the bent tube was fixed in a phial full of lime-water ;
the other
end in a bottle of the tindture of myrrh. The junctures were carefully luted ;
and the phial containing the tincture of myrrh was placed in water, heated al-
mol't to the boiling point, by the lamp of a tea-kettle. A number of air-bubbles
were feparated, but probably not of the mephitic kind ;
for no precipitation en-
lued in the lime-water. This experiment was repeated with the tinEl. Tolutana
Ph. Ed. and with fp. vlnof. camph. and the refult was entirely the fame. The
medicinal adtion therefore of the vapours railed from fuch tindtu res cannot be
afcribed to the extrication of fixed air, of which it is probable bodies are de-
prived by chemical folution as well as by mixture.
If mephitic air be thus capable of corredting purulent matter in the lungs, we
may reafonably infer it will be equally ufeful when applied externally to foul ulcers ;
and experience confirms the conclufion. Even the fanies of a cancer, when the
carrot-poultice failed, has been fweetened by it, the pain mitigated, and a better
digeftion produced. But, though the progrefs of the cancer feems to be checked
by the fixed air, it is to be feared a cure will not be effected. A palliative remedy,
however, in a dileafe fo defperate and loathfome, may be confidered as a very
valuable acquifition. Perhaps nitrous air might be ftill more efficacious. This fpe-
cies of factitious air is obtained from all the metals, except zinc, by- means of the
nitrous acid ;
as a fweete ner and antifeptic, it far furpafles fixed air.
In the ulcerous fore throat, much advantage has been experienced from the
vapours of effervefcing mixtures drawn into the fauces. But this remedy fhould
not fuperfede the ufe of other antifeptic applications.
Inmalignantfevers, wines aboundingwith fixed air may be adminifteredto check
the leptic ferment, and fweeten the putrid colluvies in the primas vias. If the laxa-
tive quality of fuch liquors be thought an objedtion to the ufe of them, wines of a
greater age may be given, impregnated with aerial acid. —The patient’s common
drink might alfo be medicated in the fame way. A putrid diarrhoea frequently oc-
curs in the latter ftage of fuch diforders, and it is a moft alarming and dangerous
fymptom. If the difcharge be ftopped by aftringents, a putrid fomes is retained in
the body, which aggravates the delirium, and increafes the fever. On the contrary,
if it be buffered to take its courfe. the ftrength of the patient muff foon be exhauftedj
and death unavoidably enfue. The injection of mephitic air into the intellines, un-
der thefe circumftances, bids fair to be highly ferviceable. And in fome cafes of
this kind, the gas emitted from a mixture of chalk and oil of vitriol, conveyed into
the body by the machine employed for tobacco- clyfters, quickly reftrained he

diarrhcea, corre&ed the heat and fetor of the ftools, and in a fhort time removed
every fymptom of danger.
As a folvent of the calculus, its virtues have been already mentioned ;
but the
experiments made on that fubjeft do not determine the matter with fufficient accu-
racy.
Of MEDICAL ELECTRICITY.
THE application of this fubtile fluid to medicinal purpofes was thought of l'oou
after the dilcoveryof the ele&ric ftiock ;
and, after various turns of reputation, its
medical virtues feem now to be pretty well eftablifhed. Mr. Cavallo, who has
publilhed the lateft and the beft treatife on Medical Ele6h’icity, entirely difapproves
of giving violent fhocks, and finds it moft efficacious to expofe the patient to the
electrical aura,
a gentle air, difcharged from an iron or wooden point ;
or, if fhocks
are given, they Ihould be very flight, and not exceed twelve or fourteen at a time.
In this way he recommends it as effefitual in a great number of diforders. The
patient may be electrified from three to ten minutes : but, if fparks are drawn, they
fliould not exceed the number of fhocks above mentioned.
Rheumatic diforders, even of long ftanding, are relieved, and fometimes quite
cured, by only drawing the electric fluid with a wooden point from the part, or by
drawing fparks through flannel. The operation fhould be continued for about four
or five minutes, repeating it once or twice every day.
The gout, extraordinary as it may appear, has certainly been cured by means of
elefitricity, in various inftances. The pain has been generally mitigated, and fome-
times the difeafe has been removed fo well as not to return again. In thofe cafes,
the eleCtric fluid has been thrown by means of a wooden point, although fometimes,
when the pain was too great, a metal point only has been ufed.
Deafnefs, except when it is occafioned by obliteration or other improper configu-
ration of the parts, is either entirely or partly cured by drawing the fparks from the
ear with the glafs-tube director, or by drawing the fluid with a wooden point. Some-
times it is not improper to fend exceedingly-fmall fhocks (for inflance, ofone-thir-
teenth of an inch) from one ear to the other. —It has beenconftantly obferved, that,
whenever the ear is electrified, the difcharge of the wax is confiderably promoted.
The tooth-ach, occafioned by cold, rheumatifm, or inflammation, is generally
relieved by drawing the elearic fluid with a point, immediately from the part, and
alfo externally from the face. But, when the body of the tooth is affeaed, eleari-
zation is of no ufe ;
for it feldom or never relieves the diforder, and fometimes in-
creafes the pain to a prodigious degree.
No. 16. 3 Q Inflammations
242 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
Inflammations of every fort are generally relieved by a very gentle electrization.
In inflammations of the eyes, the throwing of the eleCtric fluid by means of a wood-
en point is often attended with great benefit ;
the pain being quickly abated, and
the inflammation being generally diffipated in a few days. In thefe cafes, the eye
of the patient muft be kept open ;
and care fhould be taken not to bri ng the wooden
point very near it, for fear of caufing any fpark. Sometimes it is fufficient to throw
the fluid with a metal point ;
for in thele cafes, too great irritation thould be always
avoided. It is not neceffary to continue this operation for three or four minutes
without intermiffion ;
but, after throwing the fluid for about half a minute, afhort
time may be allowed to the patient to reft and to wipe his tears, which generally flow
very cppioufly : then the operation may be continued again for another half-minute,
and fo on for four or five times every day. The gutta ferena has been fometimes
cured by electrization ;
but at the fame time it muft be confeffed, it has proved in-
effectual in many fuch cafes, in which it was adminiftered for along time and with
all pofftble attention. However, it has never been known that any body was made
worfe by it. The heft method of adminiftering electricity in fuch cafes, is firl't to
draw the eleCtric fluid with a wooden point for a Ihort time, and then to fend about
half a dozen of lhocks of one-twentieth of an inch from the back and lower part of
the head to the forehead, very little above the eye. A remarkable difeafe of the eye
was fome time ago perfectly cured by electrization ; it was an opacity of the vitreous
humour of the eyes. All the cafes of fiftula lacrymalis, which Mr. Cavallo hath
known to have been electrified by perfons of ability for a fufficient time, have been
entirely cured. The method generally praCtifed has been that of drawing the fluid
with a wooden point, and to take very l’mall fparks from the part. The operation
may be continued for about three or four minutes every day. It is remarkable, that
in thofe cafes, after curing the fiftula lacrymalis, no other difeafe was occafioned by
it, as blindnefs, inflammations, &c. by fuppreffing that difcharge.
Palfies are feldom perfectly cured by means of eleCtricity, efpecially when they
are of long ftanding ;
but they are generally relieved to a certain degree. The me-
thod of electrifying in thofe cafes is to draw the fluid with the wooden point, and
to bring fparks through flannel, or through the ufual coverings of the part if they
are not too thick The operation may be continued for about five minutes per day.
LTcers, or open fores of every kind, even of a long ftanding, are generally ditpo-
fed to heal by electrization. The general effeCts are a diminution of the inflamma-
tion, and at firft a promotion of the difcharge of properly-formed matter, which
difcharge gradually leffens, according as the limits of the fore contract, till it be
quite cured. In thefe cafes thegentleft electrization muft be ufed, in order to avoid
too great an irritation, which is generally hurtful. To draw or throw the fluid with
3 a wooden
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 243
A wooden or even with a metal point, for three or four minutes per day, is fully
fufficient.
Cutaneous eruptions have been fuccefsfully treated with electrization : but in
thefe cafes it fnuft be obferved, that if the wooden point be kept too near the {kin,
fo as to caufe any confiderable irritation, the eruption will becaufed to fpread more
;
but if the point be kept at about fix inches diftance, or farther, if the electrical
machine be very powerful, the eruptions will be gradually diminilhed, till the}' are
quite cured. In this kind ofdifeafe, the immediate and general effeCt of the wooden
point is to occafion a warmth about the electrified part, which is always a fign that
the electrization is rightly adminiftered.
The application ofelectricity has perfectly cured various cafes of St. Vitus’s dan'ce,
or of that difeafe which is commonly called fo ;
for it is the opinion of fome very
learned phyficians, that the real difeafe called St. Vitus’s dance, w'hich formerly was
more frequent than it is at prefent, is different from that which now goes under that
name. In this difeafe, {hocks of about one-tenth of an inch maybefent through the
body in various directions, and all'o fparks may be taken. But, if this treatment
prove very dil'agreeable to the patient, then the fhocks muft be lelfened, and even
omitted ;
inftead of which, fome other more gentle applications muft be lubftituted.
Scrophulous tumours, when they are juft beginning, are generally cured by draw-
ing the eleCtric fluid with a wooden or metal point from the part. This is one
of thofe kinds of difeafes in which the aCtion of electricity requires particularly
the aid of other medicines in order to effeCt a cure more eafily ;
for fcrophulous
afleCtions commonly accompany a great laxity of the habit, and a general cachexy,
which muft be obviated by proper remedies.
In cancers, the pains only are commonly alleviated by drawing the eleCtric fluid
with a wr
ooden or metal point. Mr. Cavallo, however, mentions one cafe in which
a moft confirmed cancer of very long Handing, on the breaft ofa woman, had been
much reduced in fize. It is remarkable, that this patient was fo far relieved by
drawing the fluid with a metal point from the part, that the excruciating pains the
had fuffered for many years did almoft entirely difappear; but, when the eleCtric
fluid was drawn by means of a wooden point, the pains rather increafed.
Abfcefles, when they are in their beginning, and in general whenever there is any
tendency to form matter, are difperfed by electrization. Lately, in a cafe in which
matter was formed upon the hip, called the lumbar ablcefs, the difeafe was perfectly
cured by means of electricity. The fciatica has alfo hecn often cured by it. In all
fuch cafes, the eleCtric fluid muft be lent through the part by means of two directors
applied to oppolite parts, and in immediate contaCt either with the lkin, or with
the coverings when thele are very thin. It is very remarkable, that the mere
paflage
244 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
paffage of electric fluid in this manner is generally felt by the patients afflicted with
thole diforders nearly as much as a fmall fliock is felt by a perfon in good health.
Sometimes a few fhocks have been alfo given, but it feems more proper to omit
them ;
becaufe fometiines, inftead of difperfing, they rather accelerate the forma-
tion of matter.
In cafes of pulmonary inflammations, when they are in the beginning, electriza-
tion has been fometimes beneficial; but in confirmed difeafes of the lungs it does
not feem to have ever afforded any unqueftionable benefit; however, it feems that
in fuch cafes the power of electricity has been but feldom tried.
Nervous head-achs, even of a long handing, are generally cured by electrization.
For this difeafe, the eleCtric fluid muft be thrown with a wooden and fometimes
even with a metal point, all round the head fuccefiively. Sometimes exceedingly-
fmall fhocks have been adminiftered ;
but thefe can feldom be ul'ed, becaufe the
nerves of perfons fubjeCt to this difeafe are fo very irritable, that the fhocks, the
fparks, and fometimes even the throwing the eleCtric fluid with a wooden point kept
very near the head, throw them into convulfions.
The application of eleCtncity has often been found beneficial in the droply when
juft beginning, or l'ather in the tendency to a droply; but it has never been of any
ufe in advanced dropfies. In fuch cafes, the eleCtric fluid is lent through the part,
in various directions, by means of two directors, and fparks are alfo drawn acrofs
the flannel or the clothes; keeping the metal rod in contaCt with them, and fluffing
it continually from place to place. This operation fhould be continued at leaft ten
minutes, and fhould be repeated once or twice a-day. —Perhaps in thofe cafes, a
Ample electrization (viz. to infulate the patient, and to conneCt him with the prime
conductor whilft the machine is in aCtion, ) continued for a confiderable time, as
an hour or two, would be more beneficial.
Swellings in general, which do not contain any matter, are frequently cured by
drawing the eleCtric fluid with a wooden point. The operation fhould be continued
for three or four minutes every day. —It is very remarkable, that, in fome cafes of
white fwellings quite cured by means of eleCtricity, the bones and cartilages were
in fome meafure disfigured.
Agues have not unfrequently been cured by eleCtricity, fothat fometimes one elec-
trization or two have been fnfficient. The moft effectual and fure method has been
that of drawing fparks through flannel, or the clothes, for about ten minutes or a
quarter of an hour. The patients may be electrified eithe r at the time of the fit, or
a fliort while before the time in which it is expeCted.
The fuppreffion of the menfes, which is a difeafe of the female fex that often oc-
cafions the moll difagreeable and alarming fymptoms, is often fuccefsfully and ipee-
dily
245
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES.
dily cared by means of electricity, even when the difoafe is of long ftanding, and
after the moft powerful medicines ufed for it have proved ineffectual. The cafes
of this fort in which electrization has proved ufelefs are fo few, and the fuccefsful
ones fo numerous, that the application of electricity for thisdifeafe may be juftly
conlidered as an efficacious and certain remedy. Great attention and knowledge is
required, in order to diltingqifli the arreftof the rnenfes from a ftate of pregnancy.
In the former, the application of electricity, as we obferved above, is very benefi-
cial; whereas, in the latter, it may be attended with very difagreeable effects : it is
therefore a matter ofgreat importance to afcertain the real caufe of the difeafe, be-
fore the eleCtricity be applied in thole cafes. Pregnant women maybe electrified
for other difeafes, but always ufing very gentle means, and directing the eleCtric
fluid through other parts of the body diftant from thofe fubfervient to generation.
In the real fuppreflion of the menfes, fmall fliocks, i. e. of about one twentieth of
an inch, may be fent through the pelvis ;
fparks may be taken through the clothes
from the parts adjacent to the feat of the difeafe ;
and alfo the eleCtric fluid may be
tranfmitted by applying the metallic or wooden extremities of two directors to the
hips, in contaCt with the clothes ;
part ofwhich may be removed in cafe they be too
thick. Thefe various applications of electricity fhould be regulated according to
the conftitution of the patient. The number offliocks may be about twelve or four-
teen. The other applications may be continued for two or three minutes ;
repeating
the operation every day. Put either throng fliocks, or a ftronger application of elec-
tricity than the patient can conveniently bear, fhould be avoided ;
for by thofe
means fometimes more than a fufficient difcharge is occafioned, which is not eafily
cured. In cafes of uterine haemorrhages, it is not known that the application of
eleClricity was ever beneficial. Perhaps a very gentle electrization, fo as to keep
the patient infulated and connected with the prime conductor whilft the eleCtrical
machine is in aCtion, may be of fome benefit.
In refpefit to unnatural difcharges and fluxes in general, it may be obferved,
that fome difcharges are quite unnatural or adventitious, as the fiftula lacrymalis,
and fome fpecies of the venereal difeafe; but others are only increafed natural
difcharges, fuch as the menfes, perfpiration. &c. Now the power of electricity
in general has been found more beneficial for the firft than for the fecond fort of
difcharges, which are moftly increafed by it.
In the venereal difeafe, electrization has been generally forbidden; having com-
monly increafed the pains, and other fymptoms, rather than diminifhed them. In-
deed, confidering that any fort of ftimulus has been found hurtful to perfons afflicted
with that dilorder, it is rlo wonder that eleCtrieity has produced fome bad effeCts,
efpecially in the manner it was adminiftered fome time ago, viz. by giving ftrong

246 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
fhocks. However, it has been lately obferved, that a very gentle application of
electricity, as drawing the fluid by means of a wooden or metal point, is peculiarly
beneficial in various cafes of this kind, even when the dileafe has been of lon^
ftanding. Having remarked above, that tumors, when juft beginning, are difper-
fed, and that unnatural difcharges are gradually lupprefled, by a judicious
electrization, it is luperfluous to defcribe particularly thofe ftates of the venereal
dileafe in which electricity may be applied ;
it is only neceffary to remind the
operator to avoid any confiderable ftimulus in cafes of this fort.
The application of electricity has been found alfo beneficial in other difeafes
befldes thofe mentioned above ;
but, as the facts are not fufficiently numerous to
afford the deduction of any general rules, we have not thought proper to take
any particular notice of them.
We may laftly obferve, that, in many cafes, the help of other remedies to be
prefcribed by the medical practitioner will be required to affift the action of elec-
tricity, which by itfelf would perhaps be ufelefs ;
and, on the other hand, electri-
zation may be often applied to affift the aCtion of other remedies, as of fudorifics*.
ftrengthening medicines, &c.
Mr. Lichtenberg with a large eleClrophorus made fome very curious experiments;
in which, the knob of an electrified phial being drawn over the furface of the electric
plate, finely-powdered rofin, afterwards fifted upon the place, affumed the figure of
ftar&and other beautiful ramifications, indicating not only an inclination to arrange
itfelf in the fame regular order with the cry ftals of falts, but to run out into branches
like thofe of vegetables. Theie experiments have been repeated to great advantage
by the Rev. Mr. Bennet, according to whofe method the figures reprefented in the
annexed Plate were made. The apparatus ufed for making them confifted only
of a common Leyden phial, and a plate of glafs 15 inches fquare covered on one
fide with a varnifh ofgum-lac diffolved in fpirit of wine, and feveral times laid over.
Two ounces of fhell-lac pow dered and mixed with fix ounces of fpirit of wine an-
fwers very well for this purpofe. The glafs mult be warmed, and the varnilh fpread
upon it with a camel’s-hair pencil. Care muft be taken, however, not to lay it on
too thick, otherwife the effe:t will not follow. —The other fide is covered w'ith tin-
foil laid on with common pafte. When it is to be ufed, the glafs plate is put upon
a metallic ftand with the tin-foil fide laid undermoft; the phial is to be charged, and
the knob drawn over the varnifhed fide. Thus any kind of figure may be drawn, or
letters made, as reprefented in the plate; and from every figure beautiful ramifica-
tions will proceed, longer or Ihorter according to the ftrength of the charge On
fome occafions, however, the charge may be too firong, particularly where we wiftv

to reprefent letters, To that the whole will be blended into one confuted mat’s.
The round figures are formed by placing metallic rings or plates upon the elec-
trical plate, and then giving them a fpark from the electrified bottle, or fending a
fihock through them. The figures may be rendered permanent by blowing off the
loofe chalk, and clapping on a piece of black fized paper upon them ;
or, if they are
wanted of another colour, that may eafily be obtained by means of lake, vermi-
lion, role-pink, or any of the ordinary colours ground very fine.
Electricity teems all'o to be the caufe of cryftallization ;
which probably is only
an incipient or imperfeCt vegetation. Different falts aflame different figures in cryf-
tallization, and are thus moft eafily diftinguilhed from one another. Each fait is
capable of affirming a very different appearance of the cryftalline kind, when only
a fingle drop of the faliue folution is made ufe of, and the cryftallization viewed
through a microfcope. For our knowledge of this fpecies of cryftallization we
are indebted to Mr. Henry Baker, who was prefented with a gold medal for the
difcovery, in the year 1744. Thefe microfcopical cryftals he diftinguifhes from
the large ones by the name of configurations
;
but this term feems inaccurate,
and the diftinCtion may well enough be preferred by calling the large ones the.
common, and the fmall ones the microfcopical, cryftals of the fait. His method
of making thefe' obfervations he gives in the following words.:
“ I diflolvc the fubject to be examined in no larger a quantity of rain or river
water than I am certain it is fufficient to faturate. If it is a body eafily diffolvable,
I make ufe of cold water; otherwife Intake the water warm, hot, or even boiling,
according as I find it necefiary. After it is perfectly diffolved, I let it reft for fome-
hours, till, if overcharged, the redundant faline particles maybe precipitated and
fettle to the bottom, or Ihoot into cryftals ;
by w hich means I am moft likely to have
a folution of the fame ftrength at one time as at another ;
that is, a folution fully
charged with as much as it can hold up, and no more ;
and by thefe precautions the
configurations appear alike, how often l’oever tried : whereas, if the w’aterbelefsfatu-
rated, the proportions at different times wall be fubjeCt to more uncertainty; and, if
examined before luch feparation and precipitation of the redundant falts, little more
will be feen than a confuted mafs of cryftals. The folution being thus prepared, I
take up a drop of it with a goofe-quill cut in fafhion of a fcoop, and place it on a*
flat flip of glafs of about three quarters of an inch in width, and between three and
four inches long, lpreading it on the glafs with the quill, in either a round or an
oval figure, till it appears a quarter of an inch, or more, in diameter, and fo {hal-
low as to rife very little above the furface of the glafs. When it is fo difpofed, I hold
it as level as I can over the clear' part of a fire that is not too fierce, or over the flame
of a candle, at a diftance proportionable to the heat it requires (which experience
only.
£18 - A KEY TO PHYSIC,
only can direfit), and watch it very carefully till I dileaver the falinc particles begin-
ning to gather and look white, or of tome other colour, at the extremities of the edges.
Then (
having adjufted the microfcope before-hand for its reception, armed with tihe
fourth glafs, which is the fitted for moft of thole experiments) I place it under my
eye, and bring it exactly to the focus of the magnifier ;
and, after running over the
whole drop, I fix my attention on that fide where I obi'erve any increafe or pulhiug
forwards of cryftaliine matter from the circumference towards the centre. This
motion is extremely flow at the beginning, unlefs the drop has been overheated,
but quickens as the water evaporates ;
and in many kinds, towards the conclufion,
produces configurations with a fwiftnefs inconceivable, compofed of an infinity of
parts, which are adjufted to each other with an elegance, regularity, and order,
beyond what the exacted pencil in the world, guided by the ruler and compaffes,
can ever equal, or mod luxuriant imagination fancy. When this afition once begins,
the eye cannot be taken off, even -for a moment, without lofingfomething worth ob-
fervation : for the figures alter every inftant till the whole procefs is over ;
and, in
many forts, after all feems at an end, new forms arife, different entirely from any
that appeared before, and which probably are owing to fome fmall quantity of fait
of another kind, which the other feparates from, and leaves to afit after itfelf has
done : and, in fome fubjedts, three or four different forts are obfervable, few or none
of them being Ample and homogeneous. When the configurations are fully formed,
and all the water evaporated, mod kinds of them are foon deftroyed again by the
moidure or action of the air upon them ; their points and angles lofe their diarp-
nefs, become uneven and defaced, and moulder, as it were, away. But fome
few are permanent, and, being incloled between glaffes, may be preferved many
months, or even years, entertaining objedts for the microfcope. It happens often-
times that a drop of faline 1’olution can hardly befpread on the dip of glafs, by rea-
fon of the glafs’s fmoothneis, but breaks into little globules, as it would do if the
lurface were greafy : this was very troublefome, till I found a way of preventing
it, by rubbing the broken drop with my dnger over the glafs, fo as to leave the
lurface fmeared with it; on which fmeared place, when dry, another drop of the
folution may be fpread very eadly in what form one pleafes. It likewdfe fometim<5s
happens, that, when a heated drop is placed properly enough for examination,
the obferver finds he can diftinguidi nothing : which is owing to faline fteams
that, riling from the drop, cover and obfcure the objedt-glafs, and therefore mud
immediately be wiped away with a foft cloth or leather. In all examinations by
the microfcope of laline folutions, even through made in the day-time, I always
ernp’oy the light of a candle, and advife every obferver to do fo likewife ;
for the
configurations, being exceedingly tranfparent, are rendered much more diftinguilha-

ble by the brown light a candle affords them by the more white and tranfparent
day-light ;
and befides, either by moving the candle or turning microficope, l’uch
light may be varied or directed juft as the objeCl requires.”
In this manner were produced the beautiful cryftallizations reprefented in the
annexed Plate. They are vaftly different from fuch cryftals of the fame falts
as are obtained by the common proceflbs ;
but Mr. Baker afi’ures us they are
no lels conftant and invariable than they, and that he has repeated the experi-
ments a great number of times with the fame fuccefs.
Fig. 1. Ihows the microfcopical cryftals of nitre or faltpetre. Thele Ihootfrom
the edges, with very little heat, into flattilh figures of various lengths, exceedingly
tranfparent, and with ftraight and parallel fides. They are fliown in their different
degrees of progreffion at the letters a,
b,
c, d, c ; where a reprefents how they firft
begin. After numbers of thele are formed, they will often diffolve under the eye,
and difappear entirely; but, if you wait a little, new fhoots will pufh out, and the
procefs go on afrefh. Thefe firft figures fometimes enlarge only with altering their
lhapes, and fometimes form in fuch fort as the drop reprefents ;
but, if the heat has
been too great, they fhoot haftily into ramifications very numerous and beautiful,
but very difficult to be drawn ; and which Mr. Baker therefore did not attempt.
There leems all the while a violent agitation in the fluid, and molt commonly,
towards the conclufion, a few oCtaedra (compoled of eight triangular planes, or
two quadrangular pyramids, joined bale to bale) make their appearance.
2. Blue vitriol, the fulphat of copper of the new chemiftry, produces cryftals
round the edges, very fhort at the beginning, but increafing gradually, as repre-
fented at the figures 1, 2, 3, which denote their difference of form, and the pro-
grefs of their growth. Thefe cryftalline lhootsare folid, regular, tranfparent, and
reflect the light very beautifully from their polifhed fides and angles. As the
watery part evaporates, numbers of long flender bodies like hairs are feen here
and there, fome lying fide by fide, or eroding each other as at 4 ;
others forming
ftar-like figures with many radiations (5, 5). This fait fhoots but flovvlv, and
therefore requires patience. At laft, the true cryftals begin to appear commonly
in the middle of the drop, and very prettily branched.
3. Diftilled verdigreale, or green oxyd of copper, diffolved as above directed,
and immediately applied to the microlcope, (bows abundance of the regular figures,
], 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 : but, if the folution is fuffered to ftand for a few hours, and a
' drop of it is then heated over the fire on a flip of a glafs, till it begins to concrete
about the fides, and then examined, fharp-pointed folid figures, bifeCted by a line
cut through the middle, from which they are cut away towards the edges, begin to
appear, and Ihooting forwards (1, 1, l). Thefe figures are often ftriated very
No. 16. 3 S prettily
£50 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
prettily from the middle line to the edges obliquely (2, 2); and frequently they
arife in clufters, andlhooting from a centre (3, 3). Thefe figures are a long time in
growing ;
and, whilft they are doing fo, regular cryftals appear forming in feveral
parts of the drop, of the moft lively emerald colour, and reflecting the light from
their fides and angles, which are moft exaClly difpofed, and finely pollfhed. No
cryftals are formed in the middle till the water is nearly evaporated ;
and then
they begin to form haftily, for which reafon they muft be carefully attended.
Their common figure refembles too long ff crofling each other in an angle of
about 60°, and (hooting branches every way ;
each of which again protrudes other
branches from one, and fometimes from both, its fides ;
making together an ap-
pearance like four leaves of fern conjoined by their (talks (5, 5). Separate cluf-
ters of the fame fharp-pointed figures as thofe at the edges of the drop are alfo
formed in the middle of it. Sometimes alfo they put on another form, like the
leaves of dandelion (7). Very beautiful figures are likewife produced by a kind
of combination of fharp-points and branches (8, 8). All the cryftals are of a
moft beautiful green colour, but deeper or lighter according to the time of their
production. The deepeft are conftantly produced firft, and the paler ones after-
wards. Towards the end of the procefs fome circular figures are formed,
extremely thin, and fo fiightly tinged, with green lines radiating from a centre,
as to be almoft colourlefs (9). When all feems in a manner over, bundles of
hair-like bodies appear frequently fcattered here and there throughout the drop,
like thofe of blue vitriol already defcribed.
4. Alum. The microfcopical cryftals of this fait prove more or lefs perfect ac-
cording to the ftrength of the folution and the degree of heat employed in making
the experiment. The folution of alum, however faturated with the fait, will not be
found over-ftrong after ftanding fome days : for in that time many cryftals will
have formed in it. This feparation will often leave the remainder too weak for the
purpofe ;
but, by holding the vial over or near the fire, the cryftals will again diflolve.
After it has flood about half an hour, it may then be ufed. The drop put on the
glafs, and properly heated, exhibits commonly at firft a dark cloud which appears
in motion fomewhere near the edge, and runs pretty fvviftly both to the right and
left, until it is either flopped by the intervention of regular cryftals, or elfe it pro-
ceeds both ways at once, till, having furrounded the w hole drop, the two endsrufh
together, and join into one (a, a). This cloudy part, which feems to be violently
agitated while it is running round, appears on a ftridfc examination to confift offalts,
fhot into long and very (lender lines, much finer than the fmalleft hair, crofting
each other at right angles. As they go along, rows of lolid cryftals are produced
from their internal edges. Thefe are compofed of many oblique plain fides (5, 5),
and which have all a tendency towards the figures of the regular cryftals to be de-

fcribed presently. Bat it frequently happens, that, in fome parts of the drop, many
minute and circular figures are feen rifing at l'ome little diftances from the edge,
which, enlarging themfelves continually, appear at laft of a ftar-like form. The
cryftals in the middle feldom appear till the fluid feems almoft wholly evaporated ;
when, on a fudden, many ftraight lines appear pulhing forwards, whole hides or
edges are jagged, and from which other fimilar ftraight and jagged lines (hoot out
at right angles with the firft. Thele again have other fmall ones of the fame kind
fhooting out likewile from themfelves, and compofe all together a moft beautiful
and elegant configuration (D). Each of thefe lines, increafing in breadth towards
its end, appears as if it were fomewhat club-headed (e, e, e ). Sometimes, in-
ftead of fending branches from their lides, many of thefe lines rife parallel to each
other, refembling a kind of palifado, and having numberlefs minute tranfverfe
lines running between them (F). But the moft wonderful part of all, though not
producible without an exaCt degree of heat and right management, is the dark
ground-work (G). It confifts of an infinity of parallel lines having others eroding
them at right angles, and producing a variety fcarcely conceivable from lines dil-
pofed in no other manner ;
the direction of the lines (which are exquifitely ftraight
and delicate) being fo frequently and differently changed, that one would think
it the relult of long ftudy and contrivance. During the time this ground-work
is framing, certain lucid points prefent themfelves to view moft commonly on one
fide. Thefe grow continually larger, with radiations from a centre, and become
ftar-like figures as before mentioned. Some of them fend out long tails, which
give them the appearance of comets : and, at the end of all, a dark lineation in
various directions darts frequently through, and occupies all or moft of the fpaces
between them, making thereby no ill reprefentation, when viewed by candle-light,
of a dark fky illuminated with ftars and comets. The regular cryftals are often
formed in the fame drop with the others.
5. Borax. If a drop of lolution of borax is held too long over the fire, it
hardens on the flip of glafs in fuch a manner that no cryftals can appear. The
beft method is to give it a brilk heat for about afecond, and then, applying it to the
microfcope, the cryftals will quickly form themfelves as reprefented in the figure.
6. Sal ammoniac, or muriatof ammoniac, begins with fhooting from the edges great
numbers offharp, but at the fame time thick and broad, fpiculas; from whole lides
are protruded, as they rife, many others of the fame lliape, but very Ihort, parallel
to each other, but perpendicular to their main Item (1). Thele fpiculas arrange
themfelves in all directions, but for the moft part obliquely to the plane from whence
they rife, and many are frequently feen parallel to one another (1,1). As they con-
tinue topulli forwards, which they do without increafing much in breadth, fome flioot
from
252 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
from them the fmall fpiculm only (2); others dividein a fmgular manner by the fplit-
ing of the ftem ;
others branch into fmaller ramifications (4). Before the middle of
the drop begins to fhoot, feveral exceedingly minute bodies may be difcernable at the
bottom of the fluid. Thefe in a little while rife to the top, and loon diltinguifh
their fhape as at (5 ) . Their growth is very quick, and for fome time pretty equal
;
but at laft fome branch gets the better of the reft, and forms the figure (6). The
other branches enlarge but little after this, all the attraction feeming to be lodged
in that one that firft began to lengthen ;'and from this more branches being pro-
truded, and they again protruding others, the whole appears as at (8). It is
not uncommon to fee in the middle of the drop fome cryftals, where, inftead of
the ftraight ftems above defcribed, there is formed a kind of zig-zag, with Ipiculae
like thofe in the other figures (7).
7- Salt of lead, or faccharum faturni. A little of this fait diflolved in hot water,
which it immediately renders milky, after {landing a quarter of an hour to fubfide,
is in a fit condition for an examination by the microfcope. A drop of it then applied
on a flip ofglafs, and held over the fire to put the particles in afition, will be feen
forming round the edge a pretty even and regular border of a clear and tranfparent
film or gluy fubftance (aacia)\ which, if too fudden and violent a heat be given,
runs over the whole area of the drop, and hardens fo on the glafs as not to be got off
without great difficulty. But, if a moderate warmth be made ufe of, which likcwife
mult not be too long continued, this border proceeds only a little way into the drop,
with a kind of radiated figure compofed of fine lines, or rather bundles of lines, be-
ginning from the centres to the interior edge of the border, and fpreading out at
nearly equal diltances from each other every way, towards theexteriorf'5555). From
the fame centres are produced afterward a radiation inwards, compofed of parallel-
ograms of different lengths and breadths ; from one and fometimes both the angles
of thefe, are frequently feen fhootings fo exceedingly flender, that they are perhaps
the belt poflible reprefentations of a mathematical line. The extremities of the
parallelograms are generally caft off at right angles, but they are fometimes alfo
feen oblique (cccc). Centres with the like radii ifluing from them, and fome of
the glutinous matter for their root, are fometimes formed in the drop, entirely
detached from the edges ;
and in thefe it is very frequent to find a kind of fe-
condary radii proceeding from fome of the primary ones; and others from them
to a great number of gradations, forming thereby a very pretty figure (D).
8. Salt of tin produces at the edges of the drop a number of ocfaedra, partly
tranfparent, ftanding on long necks, at fmall diftances from each other, with an-
gular {hoots between them (aa). At the fame time folid and regular opaque cubes
will be feen forming themielves in other parts of the drop (bb). In the middle of the

fame drop, and in feveral other parts of it very different figures will alfo be formed ;
particularly great numbers of flat, thin.tranfparent, hexangular, bodies (arc) : fome
among which are thicker (e) ; and a few appear more folid, and with fix (loping
fides arifing to a point, as if cut and polifhed (
d). The figure (/) is compofed of
two high pyramids united at their bale. Some in this kind of form are found trun-
cated at one of their ends, and others at both. Several of the hexagonal bodies
may be obferved with doping fides, forming a fmooth, triangular, rifing, plane,
whole angles point to three intermediate fides of the hexagon (g).
9. Epfom fait (fulphat of magnefia) begins to (hoot from the edge in jagged
figures (a). From other parts differently-figured cryftals extend themfelves towards
the middle, fome of which have fine lines proceeding from both fides of amain ftem,
in an oblique diredtion; thofe on one fide (hooting upwards in an angle of
about 6o°, and thofe on the other downwards in the fame obliquity (/). Others
produce jags from either fide nearly perpendicular to the main ftem, thereby
forming figures that refemble fome fpecies of the polypody (c)
;
but in others the
jags are diorter (
d). Now and then one of the main Items continues (hooting to a
confiderable length, without any branchings from the fides : but atlaft fends out two
branches from its extremity (g). Sometimes a figure is produced having many fine
and minute lines radiating from a centre (h). The laft (hootings in the middle of
the drop ( h)
are not unlike the frame-work for the flooring or roofing of a houfe,
but with the angles oblique: and fometimes a form of another kind prefents itfelf(z).
10. Scarborough fait begins to (hoot from the edges: firft of all in portions of
quadrilateral figures, much refembvt' 0 ofe of common fait; but two of their an-
gles, inftead of 90, are about ioo°. They (hoot in great numbers round the borders
of the drop, having their fides as nearly parallel to one dhother as the figure of the
drop will allow: fome proceed but a little way, others farther, before they renew
the (hoot (aa). In fome places they appear more pointed and longer (
b) ; and fome-
times, inftead of the diagonal, one of the fides is feen towards the edge, and the
other (hooting into the middle( c). The middle cryftals (
clef)
feem to be of the vi-
triolic kind.
11. Glauber’s fait, or fulphat of foda, produces ramifications from the fide of the
drop, like the growth of minute plants, but extremely tranfparent and elegant (c). -
Some of them, however, begin to (hoot from a centre at fome diftance from the
edge, and protrude branches from that centre in a contrary dire&ion (6). Sometimes
they (hoot from one and fometimes from more fides of the central point in different
varieties (
d). Other figures are produced from different parts of the edge of the
drop (a,/, e) ; but the moft remarkable and beautiful cryftallization forms laft of all
near the middle of the drop. It is compofed of a number of lines proceeding from
No. 17. 3 T one
254 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
one another at right angles, with tranfparent fpaces and diviftons running between
them, appearing altogether like ftreets, alleys, and fquares (gg\. When this cryftal-
lization begins, it forms with great rapidity, affording the obferver a very agreeable
entertainment: but its beauty is of very ihort duration ; in a few moments itdiffolves
and vaniiheslike melted ice, which renders the drawing of it very difficult.
12. Saltof Jefuits bark. The few fhootings which this fait produces at the edge
of the drop are of no regular figure («). The whole area becomes quickly filled with
great numbers of rhombi, of different fizes, extremely thin and tranfparent [b).
Some of thefe enlarge greatly, and acquire a confiderable thicknefs, forming them-
felves into folids of many fides (cc). Near the conclufion fome cryftals of fea-falfc
are formed (dd), and likewife a few odd triangular figures (e).
13. Salt of liquorice begins lliooting from the edge with a fort of rhombic fpi*
cula°(«). Some four-branched figures like thofe of vitriol commonly appear, but
moulder away before their ramifications are completed, leaving only their ftamina
behind (6 b). The middle of the drop is ufually overfpread with great numbers of
parallelograms,fome exceedingly tranfparent, being mere planes; havingfometimes
one, fometimes more, of the angles canted in fuch a manner as to produce pentago-
nal, hexagonal, and other, figures. Others have much thicknefs, and form paral-
lelepipeds or prifms (c). Some of the plane figures now and then protrude an ir-
regular kind of fhooting which appears very pretty (rf).
14. Salt of wormwood, or carbonat ofpotafh. The firftfhootingsofthis faltfrom the
edges of the drop appear of a confiderable thicknefs in proportion to their length :
their fides aredeeply andfharplyjagged or indented,being made up of many fomewhat
obtufe angles, and theirends point with angles of the fame kind (a). But other flioots
frequently branch out from thefe original ones, and they again fend forth others,
making altogether a very pretty appearance (b b). The cryftals of this fait are very
different from each other, confiding of fquares, rhombi, parallelograms, &c. (
c).
15. Salt of tobacco. If a moderate degree of heat is given to a folution of this
fait, its firft ihootings will be from the edges of the drop, inflender tapering figures,
ending with very fliarp points, but at confiderable diftanees from one another.
Along with thefe are formed other cryftals, nearly of the fame kind, but entirely
detached, and farther within the drop, having the thicker ends towards the centre
of the drop, and the (harp points turned towards its edge (a). When a little more
heat has been given, other fpiculaeare produced from the edge, whofe ends fpread
on either fide, and then terminate in a point, and which have all along their fides tri-
angular pointed cryftals, placed alternately, fo as to reprefent a zig-zag with aline
drawn through its middle (b). The regular cryftals are produced in the middle of
the drop, and are either hexagonsior rhombi (c). When the moifture is nearly exha-
led.

fed, there are fometimes feen to flioot from or rather under the fpiculm, upon the
plane of the glafs, a reprefentation of leaves very fmall at their firft appearance, but
gradually increafing (
d). A violent agitation may be difcovered in the fluid by the
firft magnifier during- the whole procefs, but efpecially at the beginning, and ex-
treme!y minute cryftals arifing from the bottom.
1 6. Salt of hartfliorn. On the application of a very fmall degree of heat, fait of
hartfliorn flioots near the edges of the drop intofolid figures fomewhat refembling
razors or lancets, where the blade turns into the handle by a clafp {
d). The cryftals
of this fait are produced with great velocity, and are fomewhat opaque, fliooting
from the edges of the drop, on both fides a main ftem, and with a kind of regulari-
ty, rugged branches like thofe of fome forts of coral [a a). But fometimes, inftead
of thefe branches, fliarp fpiculse, fome plain, and others jagged, are protruded to
a confiderable depth on one fide only (Z>). As the fluid exhales, fome one of the
branching figures generally extends to a great length, producing on one fide flioots
that are rugged and irregular, and on the other curious regular branches refembling
thofe of fome plant (e).
17. Salt of urine flioots from the edges of the drop in long parallelograms like
nitre (aa). But in other places, along the fides of the drop folid angles are formed,
that feem to be the rudiments of common fait (
b
). Some of the parallelograms in-
creafe much in fize, and fpread themfelves in the middle, fo as to change their firft
figure, and become three or four times bigger than the reft: and thefe have a divi-
ding line that runs through their whole length from end to end, whence iftue other
fhort lines at fmall diftances, oppofite to one another, all pointing with the fame
degree of obliquity towards the bafe (cc). Amongthefe enlarged figures, fome few
flioot ftill forward and tapering towards a point, but, before they form one,fwell

figure is quite finiflied {a a). The figures 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6, are the regular cryftals of
this fait when it is allowed to diflblve in the air, and no heat at all is given.

cold, is ftrongly faturated with fait. A drop of it on a flip of glafs will foon cry-
ftallize in a beautiful manner, either wdth or without heat; but if heated to about
the warmth of the blood, and then viewed through the microfcope, many lucid
points will be feen rifing and increafing gradually, till their form is fihown to be
quadrangular, with two tranfparent diagonals crofting each other (d d). Thefe di-
agonals flioot foon after far beyond thefquare, protruding other lines at right angles
from their fides; and thus they go on to form the moft elegant and beautiful cry-
ftals (

about the edges, plant-like figures are produced, fliooting feveralftems from one

A drop of this folution fpread upon a (lip of glafs cryftalli-zes inftantly in the beau-

Je6t. Its .firttftiootings are radiations from points at the very edge of the drop : the
radiatinglines feem opaque, butare very flender [a ad). Amongft thefe arife many
minute tranfparent columns, whofe ends grow wider gradually as they extend in
length, and terminate at laft with fome degree of obliquity (

radiating from a centre every way, and circumfcribed by an outline, are produced
within the drop ( d d). But the moft furprifingand elegant configuration is compo-
sed of many clutters of radiations fhooting one from another over great part of
the drop, and making all together a figure not unlike a very beautiful fea-plant.
Of ANIMAL MAGNETISM.
ANIMAL MAGNETISM is afympathy which exifts between the magnet and
the infenfible perfpiration of the human body, whereby an gather, or univerfal efflu-
via, is made to pafs and repafs through the pores of the cuticle, in the fame manner
as the electrical fluid pafles through bodies, and by which many cures are performed.
The fyftem originated, in 1774, from a German philofopher named Father Held,
who greatly recommended the ufe of the magnet in medicine. M. Mefmer, a phy-
fician of the fame country, by adopting the principles of Held, became the direct
founder of the fyftem. He had aready dittinguifhed himfelf by a Dittertation on
the Influence of the Stars upon the human Body, which he publicly defended in a
thefis before the univerfity of Vienna. He afterwards made a tour through Ger-
many, publifliing every-where the great cures he performed '.by means of animal
magnetifm, and arrived at Paris in the beginning of the year 1778. Here he was
firft patronifed by the author of the Di6tionnaire des Merveilles de la Nature; in
which work a great number of his cures were publiflied, Mefmer himfelf receiving
likewife an ample teftimony of his candour and folid reafoning. Our phyfician foon
collected fome patients; and in the month of April 1778 retired to Creteil, from
whence he in afliort time returned with them perfectly cured. His fuccefs was now
great, and patients inereafed fo rapidly, that the dodtor was foon obliged to take
in pupils to aflift him in his operations. Thefe pupils fncceeded equally well as
Mefmer himfelf; and fo great was their emolument, that one of them, named M.
Deflon, realized upwards of roo,cool. fterling. In 1779 Mefmer publiflied a me-
moir
257
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES.
moir on the fubjeft of Animal Magnetifm, promifing afterwards a complete work
upon the fame, which fliould make as great a revolution in philofophy as it had
already done in medicine.
The new fyftem gained ground daily ; and foon became fo falhionable, that the
jealoufv of the faculty was thoroughly awakened, and an application concerning i
t
was made to the French government. In confequence of this, a committee was ap-
pointed to inquire into thematter, confiding partly of phyficians and partly of mem-
bersof the Royal Academy of Sciences, with Dr. Franklin at their head. Mefmer
himfelf refufed to have any communication with the committee: but his mod cele-
brated pupil DeTlon was lefs fcrupulous, and explained the principles of his art in
^.he following manner:
i. Animal magnetifm is an univerfal fluid, condituting an abfolute plenum in
nature, and the medium of all mutual influence between the celedial bodies and
between theearth and animal bodies.—2. It isthe mod fubtile fluid in nature ; capa-
ble of a flux and reflux, and of receiving, propagating, and continuing, all kinds
of motion.—3. The animal body is fubje&ed to the influencesof this fluid by means
of the nerves, which are immediately affected by it.
—
4. The human body has poles
and other properties analogous to the magnet.—5. The aCtion and virtue of animal
magnetifm may be communicated from one body to another, whether animate or
inanimate.—6. It operates at a great didance without the intervention of any body.
—7. It is increafed and reflected by mirrors ; communicated, and propagated, and in-
created, by found; and may be accumulated, concentrated, and tranfported.—8.
Notwithftanding the univerfality of this fluid, all animal bodies are not equally af-
fected by it; on the other hand, there are fome, though but few in number, the pre-
fence of which deftroys all the effeCts of animal magnetifm.—9. By means of this
fluid'nervous diforders are cured immediately, and others mediately; and its virtues
in fhort extend to the univerfal cure and prefervation of mankind.
From this theory, M. Deflon engaged, 1. To prove to the commiflioners, that
fuch a thing as animal magnetifm exifted ; 2 To prove the utility of it in the cure
of difeafes; and to communicateto them all that he knew upon the fubjeCt. The
commiflioners accordingly attended in the room where the patients underwent the
magnetical operations. The apparatus confifted of a circular platform made of oak,
and railed about a foot apd a half from the ground. At the top of it were a num-
ber of holes, in which were iron rods with moveable joints for the purpofe of apply-
. ing them to any part of the body. The patients were placed in a circle round, each
touching an iron rod, which he could apply to any part of the body at pleafure;
they were joined to one another by a cord palling round their bodies, thedefign be-
ing to increafe the effeCt by communication. In one corner of the room was a piano
No. 17. 3 U fort**.
258 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
forte, onwhich fome airs were played, occafionally accompanied with a fong. Each
of the patients held in his hand an iron rod ten or twelve feet long; the intention
of which was to concentrate the magnetifm in its point, and thus to render its ef-
fects more fenfible. Sound is another condu&or of this magnetifm; and, in order
to communicate the magnetifm to the piano forte, nothing more is neceffary than to
bring the iron rod near it. Some magnetifm is alfo furnifhed by the perfon who
plays it; and this magnetifm is tranfmitted to the patients by the founds. The in-
ternal part of the platform was fo contrived as to concentrate the magnetifm, and
was the refervoir whence the virtue diffufed itfelf among the patients.
Befidesthe different ways of receiving the magnetifm already mentioned, viz. bv
the iron, cord, and piano forte, the patients alfo had it directly from the do6tor’s
finger, and a rod which he held in his hand, and which he carried about the face,
head, or fuch parts of the patient as were difeafed ; obferving always the dire6tion
of the poles. His principal application of magnetifm, however, was by preffure of
the hands or fingers on the hypochondria or lower regions of the ftomach.
The effe6ts of thefe operations upon Deflon’s patients were very amazing. Some
fpit,t coughed, fweat, and felt extraordinary heats in different parts of the body.
Many had convulfions, which is what is called their crifis, &c.—The commiffioners
after this determined to try the experiments themfelves. For the fluid was totally
imperceptible by any of the fenfes, and they could only afcertain its exiftence by
its ultimately curing difeafes, or by its obfervable effe6ts upon the human body.
The practice having been lince purfued in England withgreat fuccefs by th e in-
genious Dr. Bell, I fhall give the procefs and effe<5ts of this difcovery in his own
words. #
“There is an univerfal fluid which fills all fpace. Everybody is endowed with
a certain quantity of electric fluid. There exifts an attra6tion and repulfion, or fym-
pathyand antipathy , between animated bodies. The univerfal currents oftheuni-
verfal fluid, are the caufe and exiftence of bodies. One may accelerate thofe cur-
rents in a body, and produce crifis and fomnambulifm, which is done by acting re-
ciprocally upon one another, by increafingthecurrentsgoingacrofstheir interfaces
or pores, in conlequence of the abfolute will of the operator. As there exifts a ge-
neral and reciprocal gravitation of all celeftial bodies towards each other, fo there
exifts a particular and reciprocal gravitation of theconftitutive parts of the earth to-
wards the whole, and of that whole towards each of its parts.
“ The reciprocal adlion of all thefe bodies is operated upon by the infenfible per- .
fpiration, or vapour, flowing in and out, as you fee in a real loadftoneor in an ar-
tificial magnet, forming an outfide atmofphere; it alfo produces currents in a more
©rlefs direct manner, according to the analogy of bodies. Thofe of all bodies which
can
AND TOE OCCULT SCIENCES. a 59
can a6t moll effectually on a fickly man, is one who is in a good Hate of health, and
is of a fimilar conftitution—the power of man in a good ftateof health will be then
more powerful in confequence of the latter’s weaknefs, who receives more than he
gives; it will increafe the circulation, and produce beneficial effeCts.
“ The refpe&ive polition of two beings aCting on one another is not indifferent ;
to judge what that pofition fhould be, we ought to confider each being as a whole
compounded of different parts, of which each poffeffes a form, or particular tonical
movement. It is ofcourfe by that means ealily underflood, that two beings have
over each other the greatefl influence poffible, when they are fo placed that then-
analogous parts a6t on one another in the mofl harmonical manner. I is neceffary
that the perfon who fubmits to be treated is willing, as well as that the operator’s
mind mufl be abfolute, and think of nothing butof the different fenfations hethen
feels. Credite & volete. (This is the fecret.)
“ Therefore, in order that two perfons may a6t on each other in the ftrongefl
manner poffible, they mufl be placed oppofite each other; from North to South
is the befl; you turn your patient’s facetowards the South ;
you may treat mo ther
directions, according to your ideas and circumflances. In that oppofite pofition
vouratmofpheres arejoining; and you may beconfidered as forming butone whole,
aCtingin an harmonic manner. When man fuffers, all the action of life is directed
towards him in order to deftroy the caufe of fuffering; likewife, when two perfons
are acting on each other, the whole action of that union aCts on the difordered parts
with a force proportioned to the increafe of the mafs. It may therefore be in ge-
neral alferted, that the aCtion of Animal Electricity and Magnetifin, &c. increafes
in proportion to the maffes.
“ It is poffible to direCt. the aCtion of Animal EleCtricity and Magnetifin more
particularly on any individual part, by fixing your idea and directing the fluid upon
the part affeCted. Our arms may be confidered as conductors to the animal fluid,
andferve toattraClor repel according to our will, and eftabliffi a kind of continui-
ty between bodies. It follows, from what has beenfaidon the moft advantageous
pofition of two beings aCting on each other in order to maintain the harmony of the
whole, one ought to touch the right part with the left arm, and the right foot in
contaCl with the left. In that pofition you are in affinity with your patient, your
two atmofpheres are joined; it fhows the oppofition of poles in the human body,
and is nearly the fame asthofe which may be obferved in the loadftone,or artifi-
cial magnet.
“Paracelfus,as well as many other anatomifls, have admitted poles in man. Mr.
George Adams, in his Treatife on Magnetifm, juftly fays, * In fome future period
it may be difeovered that mofl bodies are poffeffed of a polarity, as well as one
direClion
260 a KEY TO PHYSIC,
direction elative to the various affinity of the elements of which they are com-
pounded. The better to conceive the poles of the human body, we ought to confide*
man divided into two parts, by a line drawn from the top to the pubis ;
all the
joints of the left part may be confidered as poles oppofite to thofe correfponding
herewith; the fluid paffes out more fenfibly, and in a greater abundance, from the
extremities, as thofe extremities are confidered as poles oppofite to the right, and
are the be ft conductors of the animal fluid.
“ You may give polarity to animate and inanimate bodies; that is to fay, to in-
creafe an aCtion to a degree which they had not before, only by a friction very near-
ly refembling that which you give to a piece of fteel before it becomes a magnet,
except that it will not be fo palpable. You may alfo change the poles in the hu-
man body pretty nearly the fame as you change thofe of a magnet. You may alfo
ftrengthen or increafe the aCtion of Animal Electricity and Magnetifm by animate
and inanimate bodies, as you may increafe the aCtion of an artificial magnet by add-
ing more magnets, provided the poles are contrary: therefore every thing is filled
in the univerfe by means of an univerfal fluid in which all bodies are immerfed, and
confequently all beings touch one another in confequence of the-continual circula-
tion by which the currents ofthe magnetic fluid flow out and pafs in; in confequence
of this you may affeCt a perfon atadiftance, provided he is of a weak habit of body,
and has been in a crifis before you put the column of air into vibration which ex-
ifts between the perfon you treat andyourfelf; that will affeCt him, as is feen or
felt by the force of founds at a concert *
" In order to be in affinity or harmony with your patient, you muff touch him by
the hand ; as there is a circulation which forms itfelf between you and him, and tends
to an equilibrium, it is generally by that mean eafier to take your patients out of
their crifis. You next hold up both your hands parallel to the head, and bring
them gently down as far as the pubis; you may follow the direction of the nerves;
then fix your hands upon the diaphragm or ftomach, where lies the greateft abun-
dance of nerves ;
you may put your thumbs upon the plexus, and put the nerves in
motion; you may alfo fix one hand upon the ftomach, and draw the other towards
you ;
by that mean you attraCt or repel atpleafure. —There are various ways of ma-
nipulation which the operator makes ufe of, according to circumftances. If you
with to procurefleep foon, change your pofttion ;
get either to the right fide of your
patient or left; in that pofition you fix one of your hands before the head, and the
other behind; keep them there with all your might, till you feel fome heat in the
palm of the hand. If the perfon is not inclined to fleep, you muft charge the head
in different directions, by fliutting your hands as if you were boxing—then you open
them quick, and this you repeat often; the perfon feels then a drowfinefs.—You
. muft
AND TIIE OCCULT SCIENCES. 161
muff keep your hands in oppofition as before; by this mean the animal fluid gets
into theabforbent veffels—a6ts alfo upon the nerves, which flimulates the body and
produces a crifis. If you fee the patient too much agitated, get oppofite to him,
and bring both your hands downwards from head to foot, or as if you were to fan a
perfon,and, getting backwards, it will compofe him.—Then you feek for the caufe
and place of the illnefs; or you hold the perfon’s hand, and you afk him where he
feels pain, as it is increafed by treating : if he does not anfwer your queftions pro-
perlysit is a fign he is not in a perfect Hate of fomnambulifm ;
you mull keep him
afleep longer without fpeaking to him.—You then feek for the feat of the difeafe,
by extendingyour hand atalittle diftance from his body, beginning from head to
foot; if your lenfations are good, you may feel, with a little attention within your-
felf, painsinthe fame part as where the perfon is affedted—or you may feel at the end
of your fingers a heat, if it is an inflammation or obftrudtion ; if you feel a coldnefs,
it is in the lymphatic veffels; if bilious, you feel a numbnefs; and many other ways
which different conflitutions feel ;
—either of thefe circumftances will inform you
where the difeafe lies.—But by touching, which is the fureft way, you foon become
certain of the feat and caufe of the difeafe, which fometimes lies in the oppofite
fide to the pain, particularly in nervous affections, &c. You may touch, if you
like, the caufe of the difeafe, or charge it as you do the head ; by that means you
keep up the fymptomatical pain, till you have rendered it critical—you fecond the
effort of nature againft the caufe of the difeafe, and a6t like a ftimulus, which will
produce afalutary crifis, by putting the whole frame in adtion, which will remove
any difeafe proceeding from obflrudtions, &c. after the patient finds himfelf com-
pofed, and the caufe of thediforder diminifhed. When the patient is afleep, you
afk him if it is time to take him out of it; if he anftvers, Yes, draw your bauds to-
wards his head down to the feet, and rub the eyes with your thumbs feveral times,
and wave your hand as if you were to fan a perfon who is too hot—you get by de-
grees backwards till he is recovered.
“ The caufe of mofl part of difeafes is an irritability or fever, debility or ob-
ftrudlion ; by the flownefs or abolition of motion, it is an obftrudtion or debility,
and by its acceleration produces an irritability, inflammation, and fever.
“ The feat of thofe difeafes is generally in the vifcera, as the inteftines, the fpleen,
the liver, the epiploon, the mefentery, the loins, &c. in women, the flomach, the
womb; &c. Thefe aberrations or obflrudtions are an impediment in the circulation
of one part, which preffes on the blood or lymphatic veffels, and on the nerves,
which produce thofe i'pafms, on account that the fluid circulates flowly. For that
reafon, thofe perfons are thefooneft affedted, and put into a crifis, when they are
labouring under thofe maladies ;
if thofe veffels prefs upoa the root of a nerve, the
^°* l
l' 3 X motion
262 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
motion and fenfibility of the correfponding parts are quite fupprefted, as in an apo-
plexy, palfy, &c. There is not a better conductor for the animal fluid than the
nerves, as they are fpread all over the body; they abound more particularly in the
diaphragm, ftomachical and umbilical plexus, where lies the root of the nerves
which extend their branches (as a tree does its branches and roots in the earth) all
over the body.
“ Many philofophers have thought it is in them that the foul lies: it is through
them that the fomnambules fee in the dark when their eyes are flint When yon
treat a perfon, you muft follow as much as poffible the direction of the nerves;,
you may treat at a fmall diflance, and fix your hand upon the part affedted, and by
motion you put the column of air (which exifts between you and your patient) into-
vibration, which will caufe an irritation and produce a crifis.
“ Many profeffors make ufe of cotidudlors, either glafs, fteel, filver, or gold
;
about eight inches long; they have a good effedtin fome cafes: all this proceeds
from the idea of the operator. Mr. Mefmer tells us, f
When you make ufe of
conductors, you muft magnetife from right to right.’ That is, the poles are-
changed I have repeatedly produced the fame effedl by treating from left to left,
except when 1 have put a perfon into a fleep without a conductor; if while afleep
I magnetifed them from right to right, fome have gone into a crifis, others have
awaked. If you touch the forehead with your right hand, you muft put your left
in oppofition behind; and in the fame manner to any other part of the body, be-
caufe there is are-adtion of fluid from one pole to the other, like a magnet, for Dr.
Mefmer reprefents the human body as a magnet. Ifyou eftablifli the North to the
right, the left becomes the South, and the middle like the Equator, which is with-
out predominant adtion. I repeat it; it is moftt advantageous to be oppofite the
perfon you want to treat, in order to cure him effectually. Curing confifts in re-
eftablifhing the difturbed harmony—the general remedy is the application ofanimal
fluid, which ferves to re-eftablifli the equlibrium which isloft in fome part of the
body. As there is but one difeafe, there is but one remedy ; if motion is dimi-
niihed, it ought to be increafed: if there is too great irritability, it ought to bede-
creafed; as it is on folid bodies that this fluid operates, particularly on our vifcera,
m order to redtify them, as they aredeftined by Nature to prepare, to diffolve, and
aflimilate our humours, they fliould be brought to their equilibrium by any means
whatever, either by employing internal or external remedies; but we ought to be
very cautious how we adminifter them, except fuch as the patients will order for
tbemfelves or prefcribe for others, which are generally very Ample. There are few
remedies taken internally which are good, becaufe, when received into theftomach
and the firft paffages, they experience the fame elaboration as our aliments, the parts
of
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES.
of which analogous to our humours are affimilated there by thyiification, and the
heterogeneous particles are expelled by the means of excretions. Tliofe remedies
which may be given will prove to haveoftenthe effeCts contrary to the intentions
of the prefcriber, becaufe moft of them are very aqueous, ftimulate too much, and
will increase irritation, fpafms, &c. and produce effeCts difcordantto the harmony
ofthe parts, which ought to be eftablifhed and reftored to their proper equilibrium. If
treating is not fufficient to produce vomiting in the cafe of a perfon who has too
much putridity, or abundance of bile Which has been too long handing, then a gen-
tle emetic is to be given, or magnefiaif there is too much acid; if alkali is predo-
minant, order a folution of foluble tartar or other acid, which you think will agree
with your patient. In cafe of a violent cholic and coftivenefs, or fore throat, in-
jections are the beft. Thefe are the general remedies which ought to be adminif-
tered to the patients, as I am fure that all thofe preparations of minerals, &c. which
we fee in an apothecary’s fliop, were never intended by Nature for the human body.
Modern phyficians have, from an interefted view, negleCted the knowledge of the
vegetable kingdom, more adapted by Providence for the human body. The diet of
the patient is whatever Nature points out to him; it is llie who dictates what every
man ought to follow, becaufe die feldom deceives us in our manner of living. It is
not what we eat, nor the quantity, which does good—It is what we digeft. Animals
by inftinCt u'ill never touch anything but what Nature has dictated to them. In this
their inftinCt is far fuperior to our reafon. Spirituous liquors are forbidden, ftrong
green tea without milk, coffee, hot aliments, and the ufe of fnuff, becaufe it irritates
the pituitary membranes in the throat, the ftomach, and the head, and will produce
crifpation and irritation. The ufual drink may be water with a bit of toafl in if,
wine and water, or good rich wine, old fmall beer, good porter, lemonade, or diffe-
rent fyrups-all thefe may be ordered according to the cafe of the patient. The eat
ing may be good broth, either of beef, mutton, or veal, chicken boiled, and roafted
meat. Avoid anv fait or fat meat; make ufe of any fallads, good ripe fruits, &c.
Gentle exercife in an open air, either riding or walking. Cold or w'arm baths are
moft excellent ; the drinking of fome mineral waters is good in faCt, a good ob-
ferver (though not a phyftcian) may cure more people than a man of the faculty—
becaufe a doCtor never goes without an apothecary —they all go together hand in
hand, and do more harm than good.
“ If you have but one patient, and cannot move him out of bed, gather round'
him as many healthy perfous as you can; make them rub their hands well-then
make them hold one another, and communicate to the patient: this is what I call
forming a chain,—by that you communicate to him the animal fluid, which will vi-.
vify him if he is too much debilitated. You may fet him upon an infulated ftool,
as
264 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
as when you ele&rify a perfon ;
you may fet him upon a chair, and make a healthy
perfon fit upon the fame chair back to back. You may magnetife a tree in a gar-
den ;
you may have one in your room, or a fmall refervoir.—There are various
ways, which depend upon the idea of the magnetifer.
“ There are feveral ways of treating and curing ; for that efteCt much attention
and prudence are required. But a prudent man, willing to do good to his fellow-
creatures who labour under any infirmities, will never treat his patients in public,
and make them walk in their deep, or do many other things: it is very well to con-
vince incredulous people of the effects, but cannot do good to the patient. I will
fay alfo, that a perfon cannot treat more than two or three patients in a day to do
them juftice, and thofe who do treat more feldom cure by magnetifing alone; the
patients may fancy they have been cured;—but, if they had not been'fo treated,
they might alfo have been well; as their treatments are long, Nature operates, and
is a better doCtor. There are fome who will firmly afture you they have cured peo-
ple at the diftance of two or three hundred miles off, without ever having feen the
patients, and have put them into crifes. —I will anfwer them, they are either fools or
madmen ;
their imagination being heated with this idea, they are like vifionaries. I
knew an ingenious phyfician who faw every body with the yellow jaundice, and
another who thought that every body had a virus in their blood, and all the patients
who applied to him he treated as having a gallicus morbus
;
and another who pre-
tended to cure every body only by looking at them : all thefe are fome degrees of
infanity. I knew feveral perfons who fuppofed I had been treating them after I
had left their houfes— they fall afleep fome twenty miles of!', and they have related
this as a fa6t to feveral y)f their friends, while I was amufing myfelf, and never
thought of them ; and neverthelefs, fuppofe I had been treating them, and they
might by chance fall afleep, I could not with propriety relate the ftory as a fadfc,
becairfe itmuft be repeated often to hold good. I never reft my judgment upon a
Angle experiment; in experimental philofophy fadls are ftubborn, and no one can
contradidl them when repeated. Now I fliall explain the manner of treating and
curing effectually, on reafonable principles, each complaint particularly.
“ Suppofe your patient has a head-ach ;
you feat him in a chair, the back to-
wards the North, or otherwife ;you litoppofiteto him ;
you put yourfelfin affinity
with him, as I have obferved before; you draw the general current, followingthe
direction of the nerves ;
you hold your hands the fame as if you were to hold a
pen ;
you feek for the caufe of the pain, which may lie in different parts—per-
haps the patient will tell you, if you cannot find it out. If it is ahemicrania, which
is owing to the foulnefs of the ftomach, you fix your eyes upon your left hand,
which you direCt towards the ftomach with your right hand—you do the fame
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 265
as if you were to turn a pancake ; this you repeat feveral times ;by that mean you ft ti-
the atmofphere and relax the flomach, and may make him vomit; you may give a.
little warm water to promote your operation ;
you may alfo treat the head by draw-
ing the fluid downwards, if the pain has been of long ftanding ;
you may order a
vomit or a gentle purge, and treat them every day, and then order bitters to flrength-
en theftomach. There are different head-achs: as the cephalalgia,
when the head
is aflefted flightly in one particular part; cephalaa is when the whole head is at-
fedted ; one fide only is called hemicrania, and a fmall fpot affe6ted is called clar
vis hyjiericus. Thefe various head-achs arife from different caufes : if it proceeds
from obflru6tions, crifes are very falutary, as they put the whole body into motion,
and will remove the caufe. Treating the part which you think is affedted is very
neceffary; you do the fame with one hand or both, by drawing your bands towards
you feveral times as before. To treat the head, you may apply your hands up-
on the temples, and put your thumb upon the frontal finus, which will often re-
move it.
“Deafness.—If the want of hearing proceeds from a fault in the ftru&ur of
the ear, there is no cure. If it proceeds from cold, fever, hard wax, or drynefs, you
may magnetife according to my principles. You keep yourfelf within a yard or
two, according as you feel a re-a&ion :
you then fix your left hand toward the ear
and you move your right open, and bring it towards the left hand, and do the fame
as if you were to clap your hands; by that mean you put the air into vibration,
and, guided by your left hand as a condu&or, you apply the palm of the hand up-
on the ears; you may put your thumb in the ear, and with your finger, as you
hold a pinch of fnuff, prefs the thumb towards the ear—you accelerate the fluid in-
to it. You may make ufe of a condu6lor, either glafs or artificial magnet* and put
it into the ear, and prefs with two fingers from the bafis towards the ear; you may
magnetife the head, by drawing the fluid towards you : all thefe means you are to
make ufe of according to your fenfations and judgment; fometimes an inje&ion
made of Caftile foap—warm brandy and water will afftft you in jmur operation.
“ Of the Tooth-Ach.—This violent, though not dangerous, difeafe proceeds
from rheumatifm, obftru6ted perfpiration, inflammation, &c. This being the cafe,
you treat according to my rules. If there is inflammation, you draw the fluid from
the head ;
you touch the temples, the frontal finus, the top of the head, the articu-
lation of the jaws, and under the chin; you may touch the tooth with your index
and thumb, but a fure way is to get an artificial magnet, and, as your patient’s face
is towards the South, apply the South pole upon the tooth, and touch the next teeth,
and afterwards draw the fluid downwards, and you will perform a cure.

“ Diseases of the Eyes.—-There is nothing fo difficult to cure as thefe difeafes
and none of our organs is more fubjeft to be affe&ed than the fight, or from fo
many caufes. When they proceed from obftru6tions in the cuftomary evacuations,
you muft magnetife according to my rules. You treat the caufe, alfo the eyes, by
fixing your thumbs oppofite ;
you prefs with the index the fluid into the eyes, you
move your thumb oppofiteyou ;
and may rub the eyes gently ;
you drop naagnetifed
water into them with a quill : this you do three or four times a-day, and you order
a little lemonade or fyrup to your patient.
“ Theguttaferena, ophthalmia, catara6t, fpecks on the eyes, and fiftulalacryma-
lis, are very difficult and almofi incurable. I have heardmany magnetifers boafling
cf the cures they had made of thefe difeafes. I hare had more pra6tice in that way
than many of them ; I confefs candidly I have made but few. Ifhall explain thebeft
manner of treating.—You muft know firfl the caufe, which you treat; afterwards
you apply your thumbs gently on the eyes; you rub them often —you fix your
thumb with the next finger at a diftance from the e}^e ; but I have had fuccefs in
fome cafes of this kind by making ufe of an artificial magnet, by fixing it at the
diftance of half an inch from them ;
it has by that mean removed fpots and gutfca
ferena, proceeding from the comprellion of the nerves by fuperfluous humours. I
have dropped magnet'ifed water three or four times a-day with fuccefs ; a proper re-
gimen is neceffary, and fome internal and external application.
“ Of the Epilepsy and Hysteric Affections.—Thefe difeafes are the op-
probrium of the faculty, with many others, as they can not be cured by internal medi-
cines, except when proceeding from obftru<5tions, worms, or affe&ion of the mind,
ice. In thofe cafes you treat according to the rules; then you touch the head on the
top ; —apply your thumb on the root of thenofe, you endeavour to diffolve the ob-
ftru6tions which may be the caufe; apply your hand upon the diaphragm, and en-
deavour to putthe nerves in motion ;
you may treat at a diftance alfo, but try to pro-
duce a crifis. —Dr. Andry, and Tourit, at Paris, have cured leveral epileptics by
applying artificial magnets round the head, or like a horfe-fhoe applied upon the
top of the head ;
when they are in a fit, apply a magnet in each hand, it will foon
recover them. I have brought fome to, by applying a key in their hands ; thej are
very good in fpafms, fainting, and cramps—by appying the magnet under the foot,
it ceafes inftantly.
“ Of the Scrophula, called the King’s Evil.—This difeafe is a difgrace to
phyfic. Some perfons have had the gift of curing by touching. I have feen in
London two perfons who had been touched by a man after he was hanged ;, they
were relieved ; but I really believe it was the force of imagination ; being frightened
by the dead man made fuch a revolution in the blood, that it removed theobftruc-
tion
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 267
tion in the glands. You may touch your patient in tbofe parts, and draw the ef-
fluvia in ordertorefolve the glands; if there is an ulcer, order the perfon to bathe the
part with magnetifed water, and keep a bit of rag always upon the part. Sea-
bathing, decodtion of celery, and hemlock juice, may be tried, befides treating.
« Sore Throat Sore throat, or any inflammation in the head, is to be treated
by drawing the fluid out of the part, either by putting yourfelf in oppofition, or by
{landing on one fide, and putting one hand behind the neck and the other before.
“Of the Palsy The palfy, when it happens to an old perfon, or has been of
long {landing, is feldom cured ;
but if it happens to a middling age, and one fide
only is ftruck, called an hemiplegia, a cure will be effedted by being treated foon
after. You may magnetife your patient oppolite, as ufual. After you turn the tide
affected towards the North, you treat the oppoflte fide, which is fuppofed to be
where lies the caufe: you may touch with one hand along the back-bone, or within
an inch from it, alongthe great intercoftal, by applying your right hand uponthe
ftomach ;
you treat him about two hours; if you can put him into a crifis, which
is very eafy, you may expedt to cure him. You make him lift up his bad arm, or
have fomebody to fupport it; you put acondudtor in his hand to attradl the uuiver-
fal fluid ;
you may infulate him, and turn the part affedted towards the North v tie
filk firing to the ceiling, at the end of it have ftrong compounded magnet, the
North pole parallel to the hand ; to the other hand tie likewife another firing, at the
end of which there is a large piece of iron whofe furface is larger than the magnet.
Have an eledtric machine, and connedl the chain to the patient, then make him
ftretch his arms ; then touch the magnet and the piece of iron together, or one after
another, to the extremities of the hands, it will cure him; I have cured feveral that
way: but this does not belong to Animal Magnetifm, fay many. But has not a
magnetifer a right to cure his patients as foon as poflible, and employ every means
his mind fuggefts to him ? It is not fo among the faculty, they mull cure or kill them
fecundem artem, according to art. A general vomit or purge is often neceffary ; the
diet muft be good. If the tongue is afl'edled, put a condudtor upon it, or an artifi-
cial magnet, fuch as you make ufe of for the teeth, by prefling the fluid from the
bafis towards the point on the tongue: fometimes a little gargarifm is ufeful. Elec-
tricity and the cold bath are very good.
“ Rheumatism.—Nothing is more common in this country than thisdifeafe, on
account of the dampnefs and change of the weather, which will abforb the eledtric
and magnetic fluid from flying off certain parts, particularly from the feet, whence
there flies out a greater abundance of fluid than from any other part of the body.
It is for that reafon dogs will follow our tracks. There are very obflinate rheuma-
tifms which proceed from different caufes, and are difficult to cure. The method
of
268 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
of curing this difeafe is to magn eife the patient in oppofition; try to promote pe-
fpiration, by putting him into a crifis. If the rheumatifm is in a particular part of
the body, you muft treat the part affedted either by touching or rubbing, which is
the beft. You may make ufe of an artificial magnet in the form of a horfe-flioe.
If the rheumatifm is in the head, you apply it upon the top of it ; if it is on the
face and teeth, apply it on the temples j if it is in the hip, you apply it above the
knee, with the poles up; if in the knees, apply it on the tarfus, with the poles up;
if it is on the fhoulders, you place it on the humerus of the arms, bone, &c. Elec-
tricity, hot and cold bath, earth-bathing, according to Dr. Graham's principle*, &c.
&c. Some internal and external applications will affift the operation.
“ Consumption, or Decay.—This difeafe, fo common in England, is difficult
to cure; it proceeds from want of the animal fluid in the body, which waftes it to
nothing ; therefore it is necefiary that the perfon who treats be very ftrong and heal-
thy. His patient is like a child at the bread, pumping his animal juice; and he may
be much hurt by it, like a child who fleeps with an old or unhealthy perfon; there-
fore I would advifeyou to treat as few as poflible. Riding a young horfe without
a faddle, a cow, a bullock, or to be among cattle, is very good; or to fleep in a
liable, and communicate a rope from the bed to the cattle, which {Serves as a con-
dudtor to the animal fluid.
44
Difeafes in the ftomach are common in this country among women, owing to
that pernicious cuftom of wearing flays ; not only fo, but they muft have a piece
of wood two or three inches broad, and proportionally thick, in it, called a bulk,
which occafions fo many difeafes. They fhould be loofe round the body. You
treat the ftomach by throwing fluid into it. Criles are not good for it.
44
Flatulency, or wind in the ftomach and bowels, arifes from want of tone in thofe
parts. It is to be treated upwards, which will make the patient break wind and
produce a crifis, which is the beft. After the crifis, you muft treat the ftomach
downwards, in order to fettle it; youmay order carminatives. Bile on the ftomach
is treated upwards; alfo to make the patient vomit, and crifes, are good for it; a
glafsof magnetifed water afterwards will fettle the ftomach. In all forts of inflamma-
tion of the lungs, liver, &c. you treat towards you, and avoid the crifis, as well
as when thofe parts are ulcerated. In the Hone and gravel you treat ; throw a
quantity of fluid and produce crifis; it will promote evacuation, which may do
fervice to the patient. In external fwellings, or ulcers, draw towards you, and
bathe with magnetifed water.
44
Pregnant women, and in labour, may be treated without a crifis. I have mag-
netifed women in labour, and put them afleep while theaccoucheur was performing
his duty; the woman did not recoiled it, and was furprifed afterwards. I have
put
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 16g
put a man afleep who had an hydrocele; the furgeon performed the operation, but
the patient never recollected any thing of it. Relaxation, and the blood flowing
from a cut, may be flopped by fixing your thumb and prefling the fore-finger
over the part.
“ Fevers of every kind may be cured by crifes; it is during that time that na-
ture endeavours to get rid of what difturbs her, either by perfpiration, vomiting,
&c. Thofe people are the belt fomnambulifts, as I fliall explain hereafter. It is
very eafily underftood, by the method I have taken to explain the treating of the
foregoing diforders, that an ingenious magnetifer may treat all others, as it would,
require a whole volume to explain them.
“ Of NeUvous Diseases. It is in thofe difeafes that magnetifm acts more
forcibly by putting the whole nervous fyftem in motion; it operates crifes as well as
fomnambulifm, and offers to the attentive eye a vaft field of obfervation. There
is as great avariety in thofe difeafes as there are combinations between all poflible
numbers. Different organs may be affeCfced, and diftinftly from others. In fome
perfons the extenfion of fight is fo great, that it feems as if they made ufe of a mi-
crofcope. Some of them can fee in the dark, the animal fluid flyingin all directions,
and appearing luminous; others will fee the fkin appear to them like a fieve, and fee
the grofs humours or perfpiration as big as fmall fliot ;
and by rubbing the hands
they fee fparks of fire coming out. Mr. Boyle mentions a perfon, after getting
half-fuddled with claret, (which I fnppofe relaxed theftomach and his nervous fyftem} )
when he walked in the night, could fee to read moderate print. Another who could
in the night diflinguifh colours. Grimaldi tells us, that fome women can, by their
eyes alone, diflinguifh between eggs laid by black hens and thofe by white ones.
This Angle faCt will lead to many things which I fhall relate about fomnambules. We
muft not attribute to whim all thefingularities which youobferve among people af-
feCted in the nerves ; it is a real caufe, as that which determines the moft reafonable
man. I knew a gentleman in London, who fliook his head and arm every inftant
like a perpetual motion ; alady, I treated,when in his company, had the fame involun-
tary affeCtion. There are different methods of treating thofe difeafes,either by treating
without crifes, or with them ; fuch people are the beft fomnambules. If a perfon
is irritable, you treat gently, in oppofltion, by drawing a certain quantity of fluid
from him ; if, on the contrary, you throw the fluid towards him, you may put him
into a gentle crifls ; if the patient has a trembling of the limbs like the head, you
treat that part: if you cannot fucceed by treating, apply a magnetic bandeau round
the head, it will flop it inftantly. For trembling of the hands, you apply magnetic
bracelets.

270 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
“ To magnetife or treat a perfon at a diftance, is not impoffible. The manner
which feveral profeffors make ufe of, is different. There are quacks in that art who
pretend to have found it outbefore Dr. Mefmer ; but that none of them underftood
it is well known. The faculty of our foul, thought, or idea, can perceive, contem-
plate, and unite itfelf to, any object, prefent or diftant, vifible or invihble. That
it has adlion upon matter is well demonftrated ; it adls diredlly upon the vivifying
eledlric and magnetic fluid, and by its will determines it to be diredled upon fuch
part. We know that our foul adls upon our body, and forces any part of it to
move in any diredtion, according to its will. This being the cafe, we may rea-
fonably, believe that it may adt as well upon merely organical matter as upon
animal bodies. The thought, or foul, goes to any diftance. No obltacles can
refill it. It arrives and unites itfelf, by a fympathetic power, to any objeft it
willies, without a mailer of ceremonies ; neither the fize of the body, its flrength,
or figure, impede; all give way; the union is made in an inflant ; the will, and
the will only, is the caufe of it, becaufe it diredls the fluid towards the difeafed
and affedled vifcera, by fixing them in your imagination, as much as it is poffi-
ble, and by that means it will force the magnetic fluid to touch and to penetrate to
a great diftance any bodies to which the foul is willing to unite herfelf, and to re-
eftablifh the animal oeconomy, of which fhe is the indeftrudtible principle. Thefe
refledtions fliow the poflibility, and the mean made ufe of, to treat a perfon
at a diftance; of which experience will fhow the reality, and an ingenious mind
may make many curious experiments: repeated trials will convince us.
“ To treat a perfon at a diftance, from onehoufeto another, ispoftible, provided
you have feen the perfon before, and put him in a crifis. The manner you do this,
is to know where the perfon is, and fix the hour by your watch, and have fome
friends with the patient to divert him :
you muft be alone in a room, to avoid any
noife, or any thing to diftradl the attention of your mind. In that pofition you
paint the perfon in your imagination; you reprefent in your idea the part which
you fuppofe affedled.andyou treat in thefame manner as if the perfon were before
you. That fympathy of body and mind which exifts between you and him will pro-
duce acrifis and fomnambulifm ; that phaenomenon is very interefting. You may
alfo from the fame principles treat a perfon in the fame room, without his or her
knowledge, by fixing your mind and your eyes upon the part affedled, or upon
the heart, flomach, &c. and produce crifes and fomnambulifm.
£f
Dropsy. There are different forts of this difeafe, according to the parts which
are affedled. I fliall treat of the manner of curing theafcite, which is, when there
is a colledtion of water in the belly, proceeding from obftrudtiens, living too low,
and
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. .271
and fometimes from drinking fpirits or cold water when the body is hot. You treat
the patient in oppofition ;
you fix your hands upon the part, either at a didance,
or by applying the hands on the belly; you try to produce a crifis, which is the
quieked way. You may apply a magnetifed bell-glafs on the belly when the patient
is in bed, the fame on the legs if they are fwelled, and various acceffaries, accord-
ing to the operator’s fancy. Dropfy of the brain, of the bread, and of the legs, are
treated by extracting the fluid and promoting circulation and perfpiration.
<c
Of the Asthma. This difeafe of the lungs is very feldom cured when it pro-
ceeds frc n a bad formation of the bread:, or is hereditary. If it comes from ob-
ftruCtions, treat the lungs, and put the patient into crifes to promote circulation ; but
if the aflhma proceeds from another caufe, as violent paffions of mind, humoreal or
nervous, and the patient fpits a great deal, treat the domach upwards to promote
expectoration. If the patient coughs much at night, give him a glafs of magnetifed
water going to bed, and another in the morning. Moderate exercffe in a gentle
air is very ufeful.
“ Apoplexy. This fudden lofs of the fenfes may be cured by applying imme-
diately, and with proper care. The caufe is an effufion of the blood, or a collec-
tion of watery humours. There are two forts, a fanguine and ferous apoplexy; it
is generally towards the brain that the caufe lies, becaufe the blood does not return
from the head. That being the cafe, you magnetife the patient either in bed or up
:
if he is in bed, you day at his feet; you magnetife the head downward; you may
get at his right fide, and magnetife as before; you touch his head, one hand behind
and the other before, and bring your hands downwards; you mud raife the head
of the patient high. If it is a fanguine apoplexy, and you fee there is no change,
you may order a bleeding, or put the feet in warm flannel. Let the patient have
free air. You mud treat him four hours a-day.
“ Night-Mare. This difagreeable difeafe puts the patient into the greated
torture during his deep ; he feels often a weight upon his domach, like a man,
cats, or dogs, &c. He endeavours to cry aloud, and fancies himfelf going to be
drowned, or to be killed. It proceeds from a weak domach, nervous affeCtions,
<kc. I attended a patient who ufed to be blooded every year in May. During
March and April he was always fo; but, as foon as he was bled, the pain was over.
They area kind of fomnambules. You may treat the domach, by throwing a quan-
tity of fluid, in order to Arengthen it;alfo treat the head downwards. A glafs of
magnetifed water, going to bed, is very good.
“ Of Sensations, looked upon as a fixth fenfc. There are as many lenfations
as there are poffible differences between proportions. In all lenfations we muft
confid er
2.7 2 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
confider three things ; the caufe producing the impreffion, the nature and difpofitior*
of the organs receiving it, and the fenfations which have preceded it. It is by the
combination of thofe affinities that the organs of our fenfes may be magnified or in-
creafed to fuch a degree, as to become, for every objedl which they prefent to us,
what telefcopes andmicrofcopes are to the fight; confequently our fenfations are the
refult of all the effedts which obje&s make on our organs. Our fenfes can only draw
us more or lefs near to the knowledge of objedts and their nature, by a conftant
ufe and a ferious application, in order to attain to their reality. We have a great
number of fmall organs proper to receive fenfations; but the habit we are in of
making ufe of fome particular organs only, abforbs the reft. Blind people have
different fenfations from us; they will perceive a wall, or other body, before they
touch it. There is no doubt but we are endowed with an internal fenfe, which is
in affinity with the univerfe, and is conftdered as an extenfion of fight ; it is by
thefe means one may comprehend the poflibility of finding the difeafe of another:
of forefights, predidtions, and the phenomena of fomnambules and fybils, &c.
“It is poflible to be affedted in fuch a manner, as to have the idea of a body at
an immenfe diftance, in the fame manner as we fee the ftars,the impreffion of which
is tranfmitted to us in a right line, the fuccefiion and continuity of aco-exifting mat-
ter between them and our organs, bounded by the nature of their form : why fhould
it not be poffible, by the means of an inward organ, by which we are in contadl with
the whole univerfe, for us to be affedted by beings, the fucceflive motion of which
is propagated to us incurve or oblique lines, in any direction ? and why fhould we
not be affedted by the connedtion of beings which fucceed one another ?
“I was acquainted with Monfieurde Botinau, who had a place under government
in the ifland of St. Helena. During twenty years he made a particular ftudy of a
fenfe unknown to us : he could perceive a fleet or a Angle fliip two or three hundred
miles off; laft war he defcribed M. de Suffrein’s fleet, the number of (hips, and
thofe which had paffed by and dklnottouch at the ifland. He could do more: at
ft a he could tell the diftance he was off land, as has been proved by repeated experi-
ments in the Channel. I cannot fay this for certain, but I have feen the certificates
granted him from the governor and principal people of the ifland, and the petition
and recommendation to the minifter, who granted him 1800 livres per annum.
“ The famous Bleton, called the fourcier, or fpring-finder, whenever he walked
upon ground where there was a vein of water, felt within himfelf a certain fenfa-
tion which gave him notice there was water. Another countryman fliook when-
ever there was water; the elementary, eledtric, or magnetic, fire palling through
the pores of the earth, gave him that fenfation.

“ Of the Crises. The crifes are an effort of nature againft the diforder, endea-
vouring to diffjpate the obftacles that are in the circulation, and to reflore har-
mony or equilibrium in all the parts of the body. Few difeafes can be cured with-
out a crifis, particularly when it proceeds from obftruCtions, &c. There are two
forts of crifes. The natural one, which is attributed to nature alone, gets rid of
what offends her by an increafe of movement, producing vomiting, motion, per-
fpiration, &c. Thefe are the moft falutary,as nature aCts filently, without violence,
and expels the obftacles that impede circulation, by moving gently the molecules
which form thofe impediments, and go off by perfpiraiion, &c. The forced one is
fometimes falutary in obftruCtions, or windy and bilious complaints. Thefe are pro-
duced when nature is infufticient to expel what offends her. The ufe of Animal
Electricity and Magnetifm puts in aCtion the whole body, and, in conjunction with
her, a<5ts efticacioufly on the patient, and he difcovers benefit and eafe, particularly
if it has produced evacuations, &c. There are various means of producing them
according to the fubjeCt, and the caufe of his difeafe. Some fay there are fix degrees
of crifes ;
I fay there are as many as there are different conftitutions to treat. Some
will alfo call it the luminous crifis, fromthat new feCt called theilluminati. All thc-fe
are imaginary. Suppofeyou have a patient on whom yon would with to produce a
gentle crifis ;
you muft put yourfelffirft in affinity ;
then put your hand behind the
head, and the other before, till the perfon is afteep. If the perfon is agitated, calm
him, bv drawing the fluid downwards from the head ;
if you treat the caufe by
touching, it w ill increafe the pain ; if you put your thumb upon the frontal finus,
they will fall into a crifis. You may magnetife your watch, and to fhow what
o’clock it is, they w ill go into it. You may magnetife a flower, and give them a fmell
:
they will fall in. Magnetife a harpfichord : as foon as you play on it, they will go
in. Put a perfon between you and the patient, and magnetife him ;
you will put
him in. To magnetife a pond, make the patient flay on the other fide of it; you
muft ftand oppoftte; make the patient hold a ftick in his hand to touch the w'ater;
you muft touch alfo the water with your magnetifed conductor ; the perfon will go
into a crifis immediately. Have fomebody behind him, to prevent his falling into
the water: it is the beft conductor of animal fluid. To make a perfon read, be be-
hind him ;
you magnetife the lines as he reads: he will go in To make a perfon
ftay behind you oppofite the looking glafs, magnetife with a conductor the perfon
in a looking glafs, that you may fee him . the re-aCtionof the fluid will produce a
crilis. Magnetife atree in a walk; make the perfon wxalk; as foon as he comes near
the magnetifed tree, he will fall into a crifis. One may put a perfon in* a crifis
from one room to another ; and, in faCt, an ingenious obferver may, by what I have
related, make agreat many curious experiments, provided he has proper fubjeCts.

“ Of Somnambulism. Somnambulifm is a date between deeping and waking,
partaking of both ; the patient is a fomnambule when he can do the fame as if he
were awake. Thefe natural fomnambules, who get up at night, and do many
wonderful things, are well demonftrated. They are difeafed, and may becured by
treating. The magnetic fomnambules are thofe whom art has found out a mean
of abforbing or fufpending fome of their external fenfes for a while, and the patient
eats and drinks, goes up and down, plays upon the harpfichord, and does many
things which you delire him, provided he be willing. The firft I faw was at the
Marquis de Puyfegur’s, in the year 1784 ; and all thofe who had pretended to it in
this country before were impoftors ; for all this we are indebted to Dr. Mefmer.
Whenever any perfon has a real fomnambule, which is very eafy, by care thev
have a treafure. They are called by us malades medicins, or fick phyficians.
Thefe beings fee in the dark, and go through an external atmofphere, the fame
as a glow-worm ; they have belides an internal atmofphene, which they make ufe
of to perceive obje61s*prefent or diftant, vifible or invifible. I have had feveral
who related to me what they could perceive. They differ in many refpe&s ac-
cording to their couftitution. One mull not depend always upon what they fay,
on account of their differing fometimes. You may make them move in any di-
rection, by your will alone ; or, by moving your conductor any way upon the floor,
they will follow its directions. You may make them play on any inftrument
they can play upon; they will read, write, and work; all this they will do better
than if awake. Being deprived of their other faculties, thefe become ftronger.
No phyfleian can tell the diieafeof a perfon better than a real fomnambule. They
feldom fail to tell unknown perfons their difeafes, and preferibe for them. At a
future time, when the fcience is better eftabliflied, I fhall publifti a full account
of the theory of fomnambulifm.
“ Some will accufe me of having faid too much ; but thofe who know me per-
fonall v will never accufe me of relating any thing which I cannot demonflrate ;
and thofe who repeat thefe marvellous narrations hurt themfelves and the fcience
in the eyes of really learned men. Thofe (lories, like tradition, which are handed
down from generation to generation, and become improbable, like antiquity, lofe
their former luftre. I would advife my pupils to try thofe experiments I have
fhown them firft, and try the others afterward.

ftone, or refnious matter, minerals, &c. fill it up all but fix inches; put feme
loadftones and artificial magnets indifferent dire6tions : then cover the whole to the
edge with fine dry-river fand, put the lid over; place in the middle a polilhed
iron bar about eight feet high, with fprigs to it, to attract the univerfal fluid which
concentres itfelf in the refervoir. At the far corner place an arbor vitro in A box,
and place under it a ftrong magnet, the north pole upwards; the fouth pole is fixed
in a hole upon the cover, by that means you increafe the motion of the tree, and,
becoming vegetalifed, it will grow without water. You make holes all round,
about eighteen inches diftant;put iron or brafs conductors behind, fo as to touch
the patients who come next to it. ConneCt a chain of an eleCtric machine ;
infulate
your patients, and make them hold hands; it will increafe the aCtion in them.
You may treat them in that manner; you will the fooner put them into crifes. I
have had all my patients round my refervoir in a crifis at a time. I could not at-
tend them. You may have a tree in a box, upon infulated feet; have afmall box
with vitrifiable matter, and fill it with water : you may make ufe of a large bottle
filled with water only, and conned a chain to it. All this apparatus may be made
differently, according to the idea. Some take every morning brimftone or lozenges
;
and have brimftone in their fleeves, and rub themfelves with different ingredients;
but I never made ufe of any, and produced a great many efleCts.
“ To magnetife a tree, you muft Hand facing the north; you muff have a con-
ductor which you have magnetifed ;
you muft then point it from the top of the
higheft branches to the roots; do the fame from the other branches; if the tree is
fo large that you cannot fee the branches on the other fide, change your pofition
from fouth to north, and do the fame; then approach the tree; clap you hands
round it, and ftay in that pofition five minutes, your tree becomes magnetifed.
Any patient who has been in a crifis, or fomnarabulifm, will diftinguifh it. Some
will go in a crifis as foon as they come near it; others, if they are in foinnambulifm,
will difeover it among the reft.
“ You may magnetife a myrtle, or any other fhrub; it will appear luminous in
the dark. You may magnetife a flower, by putting your thumbs in the middle,
and eftablifh an equator; then, drawing your thumbs to the extremities, you prefs
your thumb with the next finger, and you throw the fluid upon the flower; it will
appear luminous in the dark: by giving it to a perfon to fmell, who has been in a
crifis before, he will go into one again. *

your hands to the extremities, your thumbs at the top, and rub the extremities with

them ; by thefe means you will impregnate it with an eleCtrical fluid, that feems
luminous in the dark, and as fulphurous as the eleCtric rubbing.
“ To magnetife a Chilling, or a guinea, put your thumbs in the middle, and
draw them to the extremities, it will appear as a ball of fire. A watch is magne-
tifed in the fame manner, by drawing your two thumbs at the lop, and your index
under it; efiablifhan equator, and draw your fingers to the two poles: by fliowing
it to a perfon who has been already in a crifis, he will fall in one again. They can
tell you what o’clock it is in the dark; if afleep they can tell you the fame, by
fhowing a watch.
“ To magnetife a harpfichord, fix your hands fpread in the middle, and draw
them towards the extremities ; then rub the end you touch the ftrings with one after
another, in the fame manner, and thus you will impregnate it with an eleCtric fluid.
As foon as a perfon plays upon the harpfichord, make your patient touch it with his
hand or finger, he will fall in a crifis immediately.
“ To magnetife a room, or a bed, is the fame. Set it to the north, facing the
fouth ;
point your conductor up to the ceiling; bring it down towards you; point
it to the weft and eaft, and bring it alfo to your feet; the room will appear all lu-
minous, and the bed alfo.
A pond may be magnetifed in the fame manner, by pointing your condu6tor
over the furface of the water, from the cardinal points ; touch the water with it, and
make your patient do the fame; he will have a fhock in falling in, and it may be
of fervice to him. From thefe few experiments it is eafy to conceive, that any in-
aniniated body may be eleCtrifled or magnetifed by another animal body, juft as
eafily as by an electrifying machine, or by the force of magnets.”
ARGUMENTS to PROVE, that ANIMAL MAGNETISM is the CAUSE
of SYMPATHY in MAN and other ANIMALS, and in PLANTS, &c.
THAT conftantflux and reflux of the vital principles and corporeal humours in
man (without which both motion and life are flopped) produce thofe efleCis of
fympathy and antipathy which become more natural and lefs miraculous; the at-
mofpherical particle to each individual receives from the general fluid the proper
attraction and repulfion. In the divers crofiings of thofe individual atmofpheres,
fome emanations are more attractive between two beings, and others more repulfive;
fo again, when one body poffefles more fluid than another, it will repel; and that
body which is lefs will make an effort to reflore itfelf into equilibrium or fym-
pathy with the other body. Robin Abraham Benhannes fays, iron or ferruginous
particles are every where, not only in the mineral world, but in our blood and bones;
now.
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES, *77
now, as the magnet attracts ferruginous particles, everything of courfe is fubfer-
vient to magnetifm by the power of attra6tion or fympathy,
I could relate a variety of examples to prove that fympathetic affcdtion which
prevails with people of the fame family, views, fed, or any other caufe that binds
them harmonioufly together; but, as it is a lubjedt which every one miift have
experienced, I fhall not touch further on it.
The magnetic fluid often occalions fome contra6lions in other parts of the bod}1
',
when a mufcle has been wounded, which produces different motions in the organs
of the fame body. Whether they have a fecret affinity or not is a queftion not yet
determined ; however, I am inclined to think they have. Thefe motions have af-
tonilhed many phyficians who have refle6ted upon this art, particularly Barthe,
who has well explained them by a fubtile motion which he calls vital fluid, and
which he might as well have called animal ele6lricity and magnetifm.
Of ANTIPATHY.
WE do not all refemble the Trojan ffiepherd, who awarded the apple to the
faireft ; it is not alvva}^ the handfomeft woman that wins our affections ; our inte-
rior emotions are involuntary feizures independent of the influence of beauty, and
are the forerunners oflove. So again, when two atmofpheres are in equilibrium,
that is to fay, when thofe corpufcular emanations are in affinity with each other, it
produceth fympathy, or attraction; but, when thofe atmofpheres are croffing each
other, it produceth antipathy or repulfion.
The difcordance of tempers, religious deputations, politics, &c. have frequently
been the caufe of inveterate hatred ; how can we otherwife account for that fudden
averfion we feel for certain objects or perfons, if it be not in the difagreeable im-
preffions communicated to the nerves, and then to the brain, from the emiffion of
thofe perfons or objects ? This can be called by no other name than antipathy.
By antipathy many people find out the difeafes of others ; they feel within them-
felves, in the oppofite fide, the fame pain the other perfons have. If I put a dif-
eafed perfon in contact with another perfon in fomnambulifm, they inftantly feel
the fame pain ; however, only during the time they are in contaft. It may be
called fympathy ; but, as they fuffer in fome proportion during that time, it is
properly antipathy. It is well known there are many people who entertain an
antipathy to different animals, &c.
EFFECTS of ANTIPATHY and SYMPATHY in BRUTE ANIMALS.
ANIMALS in general, like ourfelves, move at the afpedt of pleafure, and fly
from that ofdiftrefs; in fome refpe&s they are fenfible beings that feem to enjoy a
No. 18. 4 B will

will adequate to determine their different motions, nay, fometimes to be poffefTed of
the fentiments, vices, and paffions, of mankind, and experience likevvife inclination
and hatred, which feldom vary in their objedls ; whence proceeds that conflant love
that fome animals fhow for certain fpecies, whilft they bear the flrongeft antipathy
.and averfion to others. They are differently affedled according to their different
fpecies by corpufcular emiffions, but are nearly the fame when they flow from the
fame fpecies. Hence the one conflantly becomes the objedt of the other’s averfions.
Thus one animal only lives to deftroy and devour; and in his turn contributes, by
his own deflru&ion, to the prefervation of a flronger animal. Thus nature is fup-
portedby thefe fucceffive deflrudtions, new combinations arife from the compofi-
tions operated in her bofom : like the phoenix, flie only dies to revive, and return
brighter out of her own allies. Without thinking (as the ancients did) that a firing
made out of the bowels of a wolf and another from a flieep cannot agree, or, if two
drums made out of their fkins, the found proceeding from that of the wolf-fkin
would deprive the other of all found, antipathy between certain fpecies is evidently
a means allotted them by inftindt to difcover their prey or avoid their enemy. Thus
the wolf purfues the lamb, the dove dreads the falcon, the wren the eagle, the gold-
finch the toad, the hen the fox, the water-fowl the flork, the grafshopper thefwal-
low, the blackbird the hawk, the nightingale the butcher-bird, the frog the eel,
the fnail the partridge, the oilier the crab, the tench the pike, the fly the fpider,
and the fpider the fcorpion. The lion diflikes the cock, the ape the tortoife, the
horfe the camel, lizard the ferpent, the boar the fea-calf, the martin the vulture,
the owl the crow, the tunny the dolphin, the conger the lamprey, with an infinite
number of others too tedious to be mentioned. The fmell of lobflers drives bees
away; the owl deftiroys the eggs of the crow, the flork thofe of the bat, the weafel
thofe of the hen ;
the heron and the lark are continually at war, by deftroying each
other’s young. If the eagle devours the ferpent, the latter climbs up the rocks and
revenges itfelf by fucking its enemy’s eggs ; the toad and the rattlefnake, under the
^rafs, by darting through their pores the magnetic fluid,fafcinate their prey; the
weafel in vain endeavours to avoid them ; lhe leaps from one place to another, and
her flrength is at lafl exhaufled to no purpofe ; obliged to draw near the enemy,
fhe iffuesadifmal cry, and, being violently attradled towards the reptile’s mouth, pre-
cipitates herfelf into it, and there finds her grave. To revenge this vi6lim, the field-
i'pider fpins her web fufpendedover the toad : her influence troubles and atlaft lulls
him to fieep. In like manner the flag’s breath attra&s the ferpent, and occafions in
him a giddinefs. The viper, with fiery eyes and contra6led mufcles, darts veno-
mous corpufeles on the branch of the tree where the nightingale finds an afylum;
foon after* the wood-finger lofes his voice, is thrown into convulfions, falls down,
and
279
and the occult sciences.
and is devoured by the viper. It is owing to the effects of emiffion that the hound
finds out the game, and purfues it to its den, where it feek for a refuge. It is by
this fame fenfation that the partridge flops in the middle of a fallow ground, and
forgets the has the power of flying.
Animals are as fufceptible of fympathetical as of an antipathetical attachments:
according to fome naturalifts, the fox is fond of the ferpent’s company, and the duck
of that of the toad; the bear avoids treadingjon the ant, the nightingale loves the
peacock, the kite protedts the cuckoo, partridges and pheafants doat on the flag,
and doves on teal. We are told that a lizard, elephant, and dolphin, are fond of
a man ; but this is nothing to the attachment of a dog to its matter : he follows him
to all places ;
and, fhould he happen to lofe fight of him, he ftill finds out where he
paffed only by the emanation he has left in his way, (which efcapesmore abundantly
through the toes, as being more porous ;)
and, if he meets him, by athoufandtranf-
ports teftifies his joy.
Of ATTRACTION and REPULSION, otherwife called SYMPATHY and
ANTIPATHY, in PLANTS.
PLANTS, like men, have their tranfpiration and emiflion produced by a pref-
fure of a magnetic fluid which penetrates them ; and they carry in all their fibres
that vivifying fluid, and have alfo their private fpheres of attraftion and repulfion.
Hence that inclination that fome vegetables feem to have to come nearer to each
other, to grow and die together; hence that hatred that has been oblerved amongfl
others, and the efforts feemingly made ufeof to repel each other. /
The vine feems to improve under the elm, the olive-tree with the aloe-tree, the
plantain with the fig-tree, the agaric with the cedrus, afparagus with penny-royal,
and the cocoa grows powerfully under the fliade of ebony; the refinous-tree is fa-
vourable to the femla, and the cotyledon and the fir-tree to the different fpecies of
aconitum and folanum. By a like fympathy the poppy adorns the harveft, the wa-
ter-lily[likesjthe ranunculus, and rue likes the.water-lily ; the lily fprings delightfully
by the rofe, near garlic, where it appears more fhining, and fmells more perfumed
notwithftanding the fmell of the latter is fo offenfive; the rofe is unfavourable to
onions, bafilicum dries up near rice, and cabbages die away near the cyclamen and
origanum ; the oak does not like the olive, the vines diflike laurel and hemlock*
and hemlock dies away near the vines. The latter brings to our recolle&ion the
do6trine of old Robin Abraham Benhannes, who in the 14th century attributed
the colour of wine and its fermentation to the ferruginous particles of the grape,
and to their union by magnetifm. The effluvia from the hands or any part of
man’s body is the caufe why flowers or herbs droop when touched ; the fenfitive
plant
tio A KEY TO PHYSIC,
plant is a ftriking in (lance of the force of- this obfervation. The mufeicapa, or
catch-fly, mifnofe, and oxalis, the flower martima, annona, dandelion, pimpernel,
flower of ciftus, helianthimum, epine venette, and callus opuntia, acquire a very
remarkable motion by i r ri tab ill ty.
.
We could take notice of numberlefs others; in faCt there are none infenfible to
the emanation of furrounding bodies ; all move in a reciprocal fphere of attraction
and repulflon. The fun, whofe heat attracts the magnetic fluid, dilates or contracts
plants in general according to the ordinary courfe of nature, the granadille (which
in fine weather fliows the time of the day,) the tragopogon, or goat’s beard, heliotro*
pus, the cameliorus, and chryfanthemurn (or daify of the field), the tulip, the lily
of Per fia, elemone, the fouci, all fliow by their motion the courfe of the flan, whofe
influence attracts in their different ramifications the principles that vivify them.
When the fun darts his ray, the enamelled flowers regtife and acaflia open their
leaves to receive the influence; but, if he withdraws from the horizon,you fee their
leaves clafp and the flowers decay, till the all-enlivening fun again vivifies them.
There is a kind of clover pul in aCtion by the folar heat, according to the different
degrees of the efficient fluid. This clover will appear whitilh in the morning, of a.
purple colour in the middle of the day, and towards the evening it looks yellow and
pale. It is the abundance of that fluid in fome plants which renders them fo apt to
infpire men and other animals with defire of love; and it is the want of it in others
that appeafes the heat of blood, and flops the progrefs of rifmg paflion.
CONSIDERATIONS on the INDISPOSITIONS and DISEASES of MAN.
MAN, with regard to his prefervation, ought to be confidered,
1. In a State of Sleeping.
2. In a State of Waking.
3. In a State of Health.
4. In a State of Indifpofition.
If we furvey all nature, we find in men, animals, plants, &c. but two principles,
matter and motion. The whole of the matter which conllitutes him may be either
increafed or diminiflied. The diminution ought to be repaired from the general
mafs by the means of aliments, as food, drink, and other ftimuli.
. Motion may in like manner be either increafed or diminiflied. The diminution
occafloned by motion, as walking or any other bodily exercife, is repaired by fleep.
Man fuftaining two kinds of Ioffes, it neceffarily follows that there muft be two
kinds of reparation in the ilate of fleep. Man aCts like a machine whofe principles
of motion are applied inwardly and independently of the organs of fenfe. The
fleeping
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 23 I
Sleeping ftate of man is when the ufe and fun&ion of a confiderable part of his in-
dividual faculties are fufpended for a while, during which the quantity of motion
loft while awake is repaired by the general currents in which he is placed. There
are two forts ofcurrents with regard to man,—gravity, and the magnetic current fr om
one pole to the other; that is to fay, from head to foot, man receives and colledlsa
certain quantity of the univerfal current as if in a refervoir; the overplus of motion
(or the overflowing of this refervoir) determines theftate of waking. This exigence
of man begins in a Hate of deep; the degree of motion he receives in that lute,
proportionate to the mafs, is employed in the formation and unfoldingof his organs.
As foon as his formation is completed, he awakes, and makes efforts on his mother
powerful enough to bring him into the world. If his conftitution is debilitated,
his motion being too flow owing to his weaknefs, he will prefent a wrong pofition,
and will not come into the world without afliftance, from not having fuffieient
llrength to turn himl'elf the proper way.
Man is in a Hate of health, when all the parts of which he is compofed have
the power of exercifing thefundlions they were defigned for with pleafureand eafe.
If there is perfect order in all the functions, it conftitutes a Hate of harmony or
equilibrium. Illnefs is the oppofite Hate, wherein harmony is ditlurbed, and is
either extended over the whole fyftem or confined to one part.
Health may be reprefented by a right line. Illnefs is a deviation from that right
line: that deviation is more or lefs confiderable, according to the ftrength of the
difeafe ; the remedy adjufts the order or harmony which was difturbed ; the quan-
tity of the univerfal motion that man receives in his origin becomes tonical by be-
ing modified in the womb, and helps the unfolding of the vifeera, and all the other
Organical parts of his conftitution.
This power of motion is the principle of life ; this principle maintains and re6li-
fies the functions of the vifeera. Vifeera are the conftituent and organical parts,
which prepare, redtify, and affimulate, all humours, determine their motion, fecre-
tions, and excretions. The vital principle, being a part of the univerfal motion, and
obeying the common laws of the univerfal fluid, is confequently fubjedled to the
impreffions of the influences ofceleftial, earthly, and particular, bodies with which
it is furrounded. That faculty or property of man, which renders him fufceptible
of all thefe impreffions, is animal magnetifm or animal ele&ricity.
Man, being conftantly in the univerfal and particular currents, is penetrated by
them ;
the motion of the modified fluid by the different organizations of its confti-
tuerit parts becomes tonical ; it follows in that ftate the continuity of the body to
the extreme parts. From tliefe extremities of the body either flow out or pafs in
No. i8. 4C currents
A KEY TO PHYSIC,
currents the tinn erfal fluid, when another body capable of receiving or returning
them is placed in an oppofite point. ,
i. There is a circulation formed between the currents paflmg in and out. 2. Thefe
currents are ftraitened and almoft re-united in the fame point; and thefe two caufes^
concur together to increafe fueceflively the celerity of motion-
Thefe points of emanation or introduction to or from the tonical current are
poles, bearing analogy to thofe we fee in load Hones or artificial magnets; confe-
quently there are fome currents coming or ifliiing out of the poles which deftroy or
ftrengthen each other; their communications being the fame, itfuflices todetermine
one for the oppofite to be formed at the fame time. Upon a fuppofed line between
two poles there is a centre or point of equilibrium, the aCting of which is fuch that'
no direction is predominant. Thefe currents may be propagated and communica-
tedatany diftance whatever, either by continuities, connection of bodies and minds,
as fympathy, or that of a fluid, fuch as air, water, found, &c. It is a conftant law,
that, in each variety of an intermediate body, the poles are either overturned or
changed.
All bodies whofe form ends in a point or angle ferve to receive the currents, and
become their conductors. We may confider the currents as openings or channels
to convey other currents. Currents can penetrate all folid and liquid bodies, prefer-
ving always the direction they have received. Thefe currents may be communica-
ted and propagated by any means, whenever there exills a Continuity, either folid
or fluid, in the rays of light, and by afucceffion of the vibrations of found. Thefe
currents may be reinforced, 1. by caufes of common motion, fuch as the inteftines,
and local motion, found, noife, wind, &c. the eleCtrical friction, and every other
body which is a loadftone, is already endowed with a determinate motion, by ani-
mate bodies, by trees, and all vegetables: 2. by their communication with hard
bodies in which they may happen to be concentered and affembled, as in a refers
voir, to be afterwards at pleafure diftributed in every direction: 3. by the multi-
plication of bodies to which they are communicated, that principle being not a
fubftance; by a modification its effeCt increafes like that of fire, in proportion to
its communication. If the current of animal eleCtricity and magnetifm concurs in
its direction with the general magnetic current of the world, the increafmg of all
thefe currents is the general effeCt which refults from it. Thefe currents may agai^
be reflected by looking-glaffes, after the laws of light.

Of INDISPOSITION and DISEASE.
IT Inis been obferved, that man’s life is a quantity of universal motion, which in
its origin becomes tonical, applied to matter, deftined to form the organs and vif-
cera, and afterwards to maintain and rectify their fun6tions. Man’s life begins in
motion, and ends in reft. The entire abolition of tonical motion is death. As in
all nature motion is the fource of every combination, as well as reft is of matter,
fo, in man, the principle of life becomes the caufe of death.
Every unfolding and formation of an organicat body depends on the various and
fucceffive relations between motion and reft; their equality being determined, the
number of poftible relations between the one and the other ought alfo to be deter-
mined. The diftance between two terms or given points may beconfidered asre-
prefenting the duration of life ;
one of tbefe terms or points is motion, the other
reft. The fucceffive progreffion of the various proportions of the one and the other
conflitutes the progrefs and revolution of life. Proceeding thus from motion to
reft, we arrive at the point of their equilibrium ; after that point we begin by de*
grees to die.
That progreffion of divers modifications between motion and refit, may have an
exa6t proportion, or that proportion may be difturbed. If man runs through that
progreffion without the proportion being difturbed, he lives in a good ftate of
health, and arrives at his term without illnefs : on the contrary, as foon as the pro-
portions are troubled, difeafe begins. Illnefs is nothing elfe but a perturbation in
the progreffion of motion and life, which may be confidered as exifting either in
folid or fluid bodies. If it exifts in folids, it difturbs the harmony of the properties
of organical bodies by diminiftiing the one and increafmg the other. If it exifts in
fluids, it difturbs their local and internal motion.
The aberration from motion in folids, by altering their properties, difturbs the
functions of the vifcera and the various elaborations which ought to take place.
The aberration from the inteftine motions of humours produces their degeneration.
The aberration from local motions produces obftru6tion or debility, fever or irri-
tation.
Theftownefs or abolition of motion produces obftru&ions or debility; the acce-
leration of motion produces fever or irritability. The perfe6lion of folids or vif-
cera confifts in the harmony of all their properties and functions, and the- refu.lt of
the funftions of the vifcera is the quality of fluids with their inteftine and local
motion. To be able to rectify the general harmony of the bo/ly, we muft rectify
the functions of the vifcera ;
becaufe, their fun&ions being once re-eftablifhed, they
rectify every thing that can be fo, and divide every thing that cannot be re&ified.
That
\
284 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
That effort of nature or vifceraupon the humour is called crijh,
or paroxyfm;
and no difeafe can be cured without a crifis. In all crifes, we diftinguilli three
ftates, the perturbation, digeftion, and evacuation . Difeafe being an aberration
from harmony, that aberration or predifpofition may be more or lefs confiderable,
and produce more or lefs fenfible effedls, which are called fymptoms. If thofe effects
are produced by the courfeof the difeafe, they are called fymptomatic fenfations
;
if on the contrary they are the efforts of nature againft the caufe of illnefs, they
are called criticalfymptoms. It is of the greateft moment to diftinguilli them well
in pradlice, to prevent and ftop the one, and favour the other.
It follows from what has been faid, that ail caufes of difeafe difturb and alter
more or lefs the proportion between matt er and motion, the proportion of the vifcera,
the proportion between fluids and folids, and confequently they produce by their
different applications a remiffion or perturbation more or lefs confiderable in the
properties of matter. To remedy the effects of remiffion and their perturbation,
and to deftroy or ftop them, the remiffion of properties muft be provoked ; that is
to fay, in animal bodies, the irritability or animal eledlricity muft beincreafed by
different ftimuli. There are two methods of doing this : i . to leffen the obftacles >
2. to increafe the adlion of nature, by a continual, fliaded, foft, and harmonic, ap-
plication of magnetic currents.
A body being in harmony is hardly fenfible to the effedl of animal eledlricity
and magnetifm, becaufe that the application of an uniform and general action can-
not alter any thing in proportions which are both exadt and already confervant with
that harmony. If on the contrary a body is not in harmony, that is to fay, if it is
in that ftate wherein proportions are difturbed, the habit it is in to experience that
diffonance hinders it from being more fenfible, and it becomes fo by the application
ofanimal eledlricity and magnetifm ; becaufe that difpofition and diffonance are in-
creafed. On thefe principles it is eafy to conceive that fick perfons drawing near
their recovery become gradually infenfible to animal eledlricity and magnetifm
;
that abfolute infenfibility to its power conftitutes the perfedl cure.
It follows, from the fame principles, that the application of animal eledlricity and
magnetifm muff often increafe the pain, as itsadlion occafionsthe fymptomatic fen-
fations to diminiih or ceafe; and, the efforts of nature againft the caufes of difeafe
being increafed, it is abfolutely neceffary for the critical fymptoms to increafe in
the fame proportion.

is by the exadl obfervation of their feveral effedls that we are enabled perfedlly
todifcern the fymptoms. The unfolding of the fymptoms is made in the contrary
order by which the difeafe was formed, and may be compared to a ball of twine
which winds off in the contrary order to which it was wound on.

Of HUMAN IMPREGNATION—FORMATION of the FCETUS-GRI-
GIN of DISEASES—and PRINCIPLES of LIFE and DEATH.
IT was not my intention to go into this Treatife fo much at large, in my prefent
work; but confidering that the fubjeCt is of the higheft importance, and that the
Medical Part could not be made complete without it, I have refolved to introduce
it here, though I ilia] l be under the neceffity of extending my Plan to a few more
numbers. Thefe, I truft, will not be unacceptable ;
fince they will be accompa-
nied with a fet of very curious and valuable plates, defigned on purpofe to illuftrate
this interefting fpeculation.
Inc ontemplating the works of creation and the word of God, unfolded to us by
the light of Revelation and Scripture; by analogy, reafon, medical experiments, and
anatomy, we are enabled to trace the human oeconomy farther in her retirement, and
deeper in her occult retreat, than fome medical men are willing to fuppofe. Impo-
verifhed by a fafhionable ltyle of living,, and driven to the neceffity of multiplying
potions and fees, their object is not to heal, but nouriffi the feeds of human infir-
mity. The truth of this remark has been but too often experienced ;. and indeed
confeffed by fome, in thofe awful moments, when diffimulation would be vain. Far
be it from me to arraign the profeffional character in its general capacity ;
it is
only the medical locufts that I with to eradicate ;
and I am perfuaded every good
man in the faculty would with heart and hand affift me in fo laudable a purluit.
It was principally with this view, and to affift private families in the moments of
extremity, that I was induced to offer thofe fimple modes of cure and felf-preferva-
tion, fo amply difpenfed in my edition of Culpeper’s Englifh Phyfician. And my
prefent purpole being to make that invaluable family book Hill more complete, I
fhall here explain the nature of human generation, and the principles of animal life,
that I may from thence deduce' the origin of hereditary difeafes, and point out with
more facility thofe which are accidental. And in this Treatife I lliall endeavour to
furnifh my readers with fuch obvious directions for efchewing the evil, and choqjing the
good,
as, if refolutely followed, will not fail to prelerve health and long life, and
prove of no fmall benefit to future generations.

by one act of his omnipotence blended in Adam all the faculties of the human and
celeftial nature ;
and without arfv doubt, when he was formed one,
in God's exprefs
image
,
he poffeffed the means of propagating, from his own offence, beings like
himfelf. It is here difficult to affociate the imperfect ideas of human reafon with
the mechanifm of Divine Wifdotn ;
and yet our conceptions may in fome degree
unravel the myfteries of nature by caufes and fpeculations, which, in proportion as
they captivate our fenfes, and raife our admiration, excite in us a reverential awe of
futurity, and a grateful fenfibility of the goodnefs and mercy of Him who gave us
being.
From the evidence of Scripture it is indifputably clear, that in the perfon of Adam
the male and female properties were originally combined ;
as indeed we now' find them
in many fpecies of the lower clafs of animals. In Genefis i. 27, wr
e read, that God
created man in his own image, i. e. of perfection ;
including or containing the prolific
or generating powers, which are diftinguiflied by the expreffion of male andfemale ;
and God blejfed them, i. e. thefe male and female properties, and Jaid unto them,
Incrcafe and multiply, and replenijh the earth, i. e. w ith beings like Adam : for this
benediction, and this command, were antecedent to the formation of Eve, as every
one muft know who reads the Scriptures.
In this plural capacity, therefore, Adam received the bleffing of God, when he
faid unto him, Befruitful and multiply, and replenijh the earth, andfubdue it; and
have dominion over theJifi ofthefea, and over thefowls of the air, <fc. The fix days
creation were now completed; and on the feventh day God refted from all his
work; and, having formed Adam, and breathed into his noftrils the breath of life,
he became a livingfoul. God alfo planted the garden of Eden, and put the man into
it, to till it and to drefs it; and God commanded the man, laying, Of every tree of
the garden thou mayeft freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil, thou Ihaltnot eat of it; for in the day that thoueateft thereof, thoufiultfurely
die. Gen. ii. 27.
Let it here be noted, that all thefe tranfaCtions, injunctions, and commands,
had palled before Eve wasformed, or, in other w'ords, before the male and female
eflences were feparated, and made the efiential parts of two diftinCt perfons. Adam
likewife, before this event took place, was appointed God’s viceroy over all earthly
things, both animate and inanimate; the very elements being made fubjeCt to him;
for he wasformed more noble than the angels, andcrowned with glory and honour; i. e.
having the peculiar advantage of multiplying his own race. He was, as to his external
form, moulded of the celeftial aether ;
and therefore, previous to his fall, his body
emanated rays of brightnefs and fplendour, fimilar to thofe which our ideas furnidi
of Mofes and Elias when they converfed with God. Ilis reafoning faculty, anji liv-

ing foul, were formed of the eternal eflence or tincture of the Diving ;
being no-
thing lefs than what is termed the breath of God, that fpark of immortality which
generates foul and body, and is the diftinguifliing characleriltic between man and
beaft.- For, although brute animals inherit the five fenfes, and poflefs an inftinct
to direCt them in the choice of food, and to impel the propagation of their fpecics;
yet thefe are only fenfes formed from the out-birth ,
or four elements of nature; and
not from the eflence or tincture of the Divinity, out of which the foul, the mental in-
tellect, reafon, fenfe, and understanding, are all formed, and transferred to pof-
terity. For with the powers God has endued man, with the fame powers fiall he
multiply his race.
From the foregoing paffages we are warranted to infer, that the original man was
poflefled of his fpiritual foul, and rational intellect, for the purpofe of propagating
the fame to all future generations. By the force of this rational intellect, or eter-
nal fpirit, unclouded by the deformity of tin, he knew and perceived the nature and
property of every animated being; and to exercife this intellect, God brought be-
fore him every created thing, to fee what he would call them ;
“ and whatfover
Adam called them, that was the name thereof.'’'' He knew and perceived the nature and
quality of all animals; and, according to their defignation and fubjeCtion to the ex-
ternal elements, fo he affigned them thofe names which they have ever fmce borne.
Adam, however, in his primeval ftate, was not himfelf under the influence of
celeftial or terreftrial elements ;
but, on the contrary, they were fubjeCt to his con-
troul. He was immortal ;
they corruptible. They fprung out of Time, and were
elementated; he fprung from the limbus of Eternity; and into eternity the divine
eflence, or fouls, propagated from him, muft indifputably return.
But man, thus created in honour and immortality, abideth not. The purpofe
of his creation was to fill the place of the rebel angels ;
and hence Lucifer became
his mortal foe. This fallen Spirit had entered the gate of Eden, and was preparing
to leduce Adam, when the Almighty conftituted the teft of his obedience ;
for hav-
ing endowed him with afree-will, an innate power of choofng good or evil, and of
multiplying the fame, it was but reafonable to expeCt from him an implicit obedi-
ence, and an angelic race. He that is alone eternal and omnipotent, could not but
forefee the fubfequent event; and it is his fupreme goodnefs to counteract evil, by
preventing its worft confequences. Forefeeing that the prolific tinCture, or eternal
eflence, of fecundation, might be contaminated by the malignant fpirit of Lucifer
infufing itfelf into the mind of Adam ;
who then, inftead of multiplying an ange-
lic race, would generate devils ;
and that, were man to fall in his individual capacity,

further furvey, after the works of creation had been completed, animals named,
and man formed and compounded of the male and female tinctures, God laid, Gen.
ii. 18. It isnot good that the manJhould be alone ; Twill make him an help meetfor him
:
•wherefore the rib, i. e. the feminine or conceptive elfence, was taken out of Adam,
and concentrated or moulded into a new being, called woman. The emiffion of this
feminine elfence or tin&ure threw Adam into a deep lleep ;
yet, when he awoke;
he knew that an elfential principle had departed from him, and that the woman
was hone ofhis hone, andflcjh of hisflejh, not having been created, hutformed out of
himfelf whereby he only retained the animating principle, or active power of gene-
ration; whilft the rudiments or feeds of future beings were configned to the matrix of
the woman. Here then individual generation ceafed ;
and Adam, without the counter-
part of himfelf bad no longer the power to increafe and multiply. Thus the two
tinctures, or divine elfences, animating and compounding foul and body, were dir
vided ;
and by means only of a re-union or contaCt of thole tinctures, could gene-
ration then, or now, be performed. It is on this ground that the male and female
affe£tions are continually turned towards each other ;
and that the defire of love
and union fo ftrongly pervades every individual of the human race. Hence all’o the
Tempter’s reafon for beguiling Eve, and hence the feducing power of love, which
determined Adam to lhare in all the horrors of her crime, fo pathetically and affeCt-
ingly deferibed by Milton.
The fatal conl'equences of the fall, we moft fenfibly feel, and univerfally deplore.
The earth fhook from her foundations. The order of nature w?
as quite inverted.
The aetherial and terreftrial elements, which before were falhicned in harmony, and
acted in unifon, were now difeordant, intemperate, and furious. Brute preyed up-
on brute, and bird invaded bird. The delicious fruits and flowers of Paradife,
were exchanged for thorns and thiltles. The ferenity of a pellucid and fmiling fir-
mament, was convulfed by the thunders of an incenfed Deity, by forked lightnings,
by contending feafons, by devouring winds, and impetuous ftorms. While man,
ungrateful man, from the privilege of holding thefe elements in fubjection, became
fubjeCted to them ;
and hence fubject to all the perils and misfortunes of his fallen
nature.
Here, then, began the conflict of the human paflions, as violent and ungovern-
able as the elements themfelves. Here the toil and labour of the man, wEo fliould
earn his bread by thefweat of his brow, and the tears and travail ofthe woman, who
ihould conceive in pain andforrow, had each their fource. Here likewife, the dark
catalogue of human infirmities, of dileafe, and death, had its too early date ;

to this [era, which gave birth to our manifold misfortunes, maft we look for that
benign fource of alleviation and cure, which the relenting hand of Providence has
gracioufly afforded to thole who will feek for them ;
for out of the ground hath the
Lord caufed medicine to grow ; and he that is wife will not defpife them ;for withJuck
doth he heal men and taketh away their pains. Eccl. xxxviii. 4, 7.
Since, by his fall, man became fubject to the elements, from them he receives
the conftitution of his body; but his reafoning intellect, and fpiritual foul, are de-
rived from the pure effence or tincture of the Deity, originally infufed into the feed
of man. To the violence and impurity of the elements, we owe the diforders of the
body ;
to the temptations and allurements of the devil, wejuftly impute the difeafes
of the foul. Yet, by due attention to our reafoning faculty, it is no hard talk to pre-
ferve health, or prolong life, to the term of its natural dilfolution ;
while, by the
powers of the mind, and the light of the gol'pel, we may ftill avoid the poifon offin,
and become members of that eternal kingdom, which is the fure reward of the good
and virtuous.
The imperfections and difeafes of the body, therefore, beginning with Adam,
•are in confequence tranfmitted to his pofterity ;
and may be divided into hereditary
and accidental. Hereditary complaints proceed from a certain defeat of the animal
powers, or imperfect ftate of the fanguiferous fyftem, at the time of copulation.
The accidental, confift of all luch maladies as are communicated by the difcordant
or putrid ftate of the elements, not only during the time the child is encompalfed in
the womb, but from its birth to the lateft hour of its exiftence. And it might here
be obferved, that the increale or decreafe of both hereditary and accidental difeafes,
depends almoft entirely on the purity or impurity of the blood. For, if pure, in both
male and female, at the time of impregnation, the foetus will be naturally ltrong and
healthful. So likewife, if after parturition, and during life, care be taken to keep
the blood in an uncontaminated and elaftic ftate, we fhall not only avoid the common
effects of exceflive cold, heat, and moifture; but likewife that direful train of
acute difeafes communicated by putridity and infection ;
or, fhould they by chance
attack us, the effect becomes flight and temporary. A circumftance this, which
Purely ought to weigh perpetually on the minds of thofe, who know how to value the
bleffing of health, or who would wifh to live a long, an active, and a pleafant, life.
This is therefore a fpeculatiou of that high importance, that I fhall now fliow how
hereditary complaints are communicated in the adt of copulation—how increafed and
foftered in the womb—how accidental difeafes grow up and follow, —and how both
tliele enemies to the health and happinefs of mankind may be prevented or overcome.

in the union of thofe effences or tinctures peculiar to the generative organs ofmale and

female, in the contadt of which the firft moments of human existence commence,
the moft vvhimfical and abfurd theories have been let up. No branch of phyfiology
has been more expofed to cenfure and miftake. While the phenomena of the hea-
vens, of the earth, and even of the human mind itfelf, are traced with a fteady hand,
end with all the dignity of philofophy, the functions of the human body, in health as
well as under difeafes, though expounded with a profufion of fantaftical erudition,,
appear almoft in as much doubt and darknefs as in |he days of Paracelfus.
Let us then proceed to review the mode by which generation is accomplilhed. I
have, in the former part of this w ork, already explained the fy Items of Buffon and
of Lewenhoek, in their fpeculations on the animalcules found in the feed of man
and in that of brute animals; I have all'o, in the medical part of Culpeper’s Englifh
Phylician, Ihown the mode by which generation is performed, fo far as relates to-
the adtion itfelf, and to its grofs effedt. I fhall now confider it in a new light, as it
concerns the propagation of foul and body, and of family temper likenefs, and dif-
eafe: but, as the female is fo materially concerned in the myfterious adt of impreg-
nation, and in all its confequences, I fhall here take up the reafoning of a late inge-
nious anonymous author, whole opinion exadtly coincides w ith my ovvn.-
The extremity of the uterine fyftem, without the nymph®, feems not, except from
its aperture, and the lafcivious fulceptibility of its texture, materially requifite to gene-
ration. Immediately within the nymph®, the vagina, or great canal of the uterus,
begins. Before coition has difturbed its proportions, it is generally about live or
fix inches long; and when thrown into a circular form, without violent diftention,
its diameter is about a fixth part of its length. But as, in coition, the vagina is the
immediate receptacle of the penis, it is capable of great diftention, and may be ren-
dered of very confiderable capacity. In general, however, after frequent contadtr
this canal becomes much Ihorter, but more proportionably incfeafed in its diameter
;
yet, being contrived by its organization for the purjfofe of exciting titillation and
pleafure, it can and does accommodate itfelf to whatever lize is neceffary clofely to
embrace the penis in the adt of copulation.
At the upper extremity of this canal, the uterus or w'omb is feated. It is of a py-
ramidal form, wfth its apex towards the vagina. Its greateft length, in virgins, is
not more than twT
o or three inches ; and its width is lcarcely one; its internal cavi-
ty muft therefore be very fmall. It is connedted to the vagina or great canal by a
paffage fo fmall, that a bodkin or ftilet cannot be introduced without much difficul-
ty. In the broad or upper extremity of the womb, the ovaria are feated. Their
l'ubftance is fpongy, and they contain >an indefinite number of veficles of a dulkifh
femi-tranfparent quality, the involucra of which are diftindt, and fimilar to the ge-
neral

neral fubftance of the ovaria. Thefe veficles are the ova or eggs, which contain
the rudiments of dhe foetus, and which muft abfolutely be impregnated with the
male feed, before it can be poffible for generation to take place.
Now it has been, and is, the common opinion, that, when venereal embraces take
place, the w'hole genital fyftem of the male being thrown into afition by libidinous
fire and violent friction, by this exertion the lemen is thrown with confiderable ve-
hemence from the penis, and is either forced through the mouth of the womb,
and attrafled by the ovaria; or, that it is received by the Fallopian tubes, and con-
veyed by them through a variety of convolutions, till by their fimbriae they are con-
ducted to the ovaria, in the manner I have already fully deferibed in the medical
part of Culpeper’s Englifh Phyfician ;
all which tedious and complicated proceis is
alleged to take place in the inftant of coition. •
Others again fuppofe, that the internal orifice of the womb becomes open and
pervious during the exertion and enjoyment of copulation, and that the glands of
the penis abfolutely pafis into the cavity of the womb, and ejeCl the feed immedi-
ately upon the ovaria. To each of thefe theories there appears infuperable objections.
In refutation of the firft, we need only obferve, that the vagina, from its ftruCture,
and from its organization in the aCt of venery, isdifpofed ftrongly, and in every
part, to embrace the penis; and, as the glans muft thereby be clofely furrounded,'
although it reaches not in every perfon to the furtheft limits of the vagina; the
flight and momentary impetus of the femen will thus be very effectually refilled, if
not totally fubdued. If the penis be not of magnitude fufficient to occupy the vagina
to its full extent, the unoccupied fpace muft be fomehow diftended ;
and,' let this
vacuum be what it will, its refiftance muft be effectual ;
and, if it is not diftended,'
the power or preffure which occafions its collapfe, will over-balance the impetus of
the femen. But luppofing the virile member in all cafes to be fo exaCtly propor-
tioned as to occupy the whole length of the uterine canal, which however we know
is not the cafe ;
yet from what principle fhall we afeertain that the feminal tube of
the penisj and the apex of the womb, fhall be made fo exaCtly to correfpond as to
become continuous ? The femen, in the event of coition, is doubtlefsly thrown out
by the penis with feme force; though this force will always depend upon the vigour
of the male organs, and therefore muft vary from the loweft to the higheft degree
of vigour which thefe organs can be fulceptible. But even allowing the glans,
penis, and apex of the womb, to fall into exaCt contaCt upon due penetration ;
and
that the male feed is always ejeCted with confiderable force from the penis, and the
vagina to be no barrier to the progrefs of it
;
yet how is it to force its way into the
cavity of- the womb ? The aperture which leacte from the vagina or great canal into
the
)
£92 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
the womb, is in fact no aperture at all. During menftruation, indeed, it is pervi-
ous ;
but even then it is only capable of admitting a very fxnall probe ;
and this is'
no argument that it is naturally, and at other times, pervious. How often too has
this aperture been entirely blocked up by preternatural obfitrudions, and conception
neverthelels taken place ? Inftances of this have often occurred ; and the precifion
and authority with which they are recorded by different practitioners, leave no room
to evade the argument. Hence this mode of impregnation appears not only highly
objectionable, but utterly impoffible ;
having no correlpondence with the human
ftrudurc, or with the economy of Nature.
After what has been laid, it may appear idle to profecute any farther refutation
of the progrefs of the male feed by the Fallopian tubes, or through the mouth of
the womb. But, as authors of the greateft refpedability have believed in its pro-
grefs through the tubes, and tell us they have even feen it -there ;
it may not be im-
proper to enquire how far this is afcertainable. The Fallopian tubes, through
which the femen is faid to pafs, originate, by very minute perforations, through the
Fundus of the wr
omb ;
and, increafing rapidly in their diameters, their capacities,
w'hen dilated, may be about the third part of an inch where they approach the ova-
ria. Here, again, they fuddenly contrad, leaving only a very i'mall opening;
while tbeir . main fubftance is ftill continued, and is expanded into that plaited or
jagged fringe called the fimbria;, which is contiguous to the ovaria.* I fliall now
,atk, by what law in Nature, by what effort of it, is the male lemen to be conduded
.through this conical and convoluted canal ? Can the femen now poffefs any adive
Force, to . introduce itlelf through the rigid perforations of this organ, and to over-
come the collapfe of the tubes? The ftimulating power of the femen mult loon be
loft in a veffel which it has not power to diftend; and we cannot fuppofe it capable
ofading in a diredion completely o£>pofite to what is the acknowledged office of
the tubes. It muff be by irritability that the ovum is conveyed into the uterus from
the ovaria ;
and we know no vellels in any part of the body whole adion is double
and contrary. This fyftem therefore favours of great improbability. But we are
told, by fome, that they have adually feen the male femen in its unalterated Hate,
lodged in the Fallopian tubes. Thefe fagacious authors might as prudently have
affirmed, that they had feen fnovv upon the canal in Hvde-park at Midfummer.
They did not know, or did not choofe to recoiled, becaule it made againft precon -
ceived opinion, that the human feed, when fubjeded to heat, efpecially to fuch a
moift and natural heat as thole parts conftantly afford, loon lofes its fpiffitude and

‘tenacity, and becomes very fubtilly fluid, and almoft colourlefs. Befldes, it is um-
verially acknowledged, that a cohiiderable part of the femen is almoft always, im-
mediately after coition, rejected by the female. When we attend to the many in-
stances of credulity and impohtion, in the theories of generation, we need not marvel
at the aptitude and facility with which pretended difcoveries creep into notice, and
the folemnity with which they obtrude themfeives into fy Items.
Ail the foregoing arguments again® the poffibility of a pervious communication
between the vagina and the uterus, are alfo concluiive again® the faggeftion, that
the penis, in the aft; of coition, penetrates into the cavity of the womb. Nor is the
abortion of thole who contend that this orifice, by the turgid! ty of the parts during
coition, naturally opens and dilates itlelf to receive the male feed, marked with the
leaft degree of probability. How is this dilatation of the orifice to be effefted P Tho’
the whole uterine fyftem, during the venereal aft, be rendered ftiff and turgid by
animal defire and influent blood, yet is it more probable that this turgidity would
rather comprefs than dilate the orifice; and the ftrufture and texture of the womb
feem exceedingly unfavourable to fudden dilatation by any means whatever. In an
unimpregnated or virgin ftate, the womb is fo finall that its fides coalefce or adhere
together, and it has no hollow appearance whatever ;
though, from the texture
and elafticity of its fabric, it may be thrown into a globular form, which will
conftitute a cavity. Butin coition, with all its occult and uncommon phenomena,
what charm have we left to overcome this coalefcence, and form this cavity, by
opening or feparating the membranous fldes of the womb? Will it here be faid that
the forcible ejeftion of the male femen will effeft this purpofe ;
or that the ftiff and
turgid ftate of the penis itfelf will force its way into a fabric fo remote and delicate?
Though females may entertain fanguine ideas of thefe things, we muft i'uppofe the
vigilant anatomift, toiling through the unalarming and chilly organs of the dead,
ought to furnifh a more rational hypothelis, whence to deduce the aftive principle
and admirable procefs of human impregnation.
Authors have been always eager to eftablifh the certainty of a confiderable afflux
of blood to the female organs, and confequent turgidity during the voluptuous com-
munication of the f'exes ;
and this has been a wonderful prop to many abfurd con-
jeftures. This afflux, and confequent turgidity, they fuppofe originates, like the
eieftion of the penis, from the ftrength of libidinous ideas, and other locally irrita-
ting caufes ; and is intended by nature to induce a tenfion in the female organs, that
the progref's of the femen may thereby be facilitated. This tenfion, again, they fup-
pofe induces fome kind of conftriftion, which is faid to fupport the aftion of the
difleient parts of the genital lyftem, but particularly of the Fallopian tubes. Thefe
\ Nal9- 4F •
tubes,
£94 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
tubes, it is faid, are remarkably difteuded, during coition, by the blood ruffling,
into die numerous veffels which creep between their coats, by which means they are
eredted, and their fimbriated terminations applied to the ovaria ;
and, it is gravely
added, that diflections of gravid women, and the comparative anatomy of brutes*
corroborate the opinion. Were it not for the ferious refpect with which this anato-
mical oblervation hath for a length of time been favoured, nobody lurely would be
at the pains of detecting the abfurdity. Allowing that this turgidity, with all its
concomitant circumftances, really happens in the living fubjedt, how can it pofiibly
exift in a carcafe flaccid with death, and, as is always the cafe in a human anato-
mifed body, where death muft have taken place fome confiderable time before ?
But this turgidity, though it fometimes may happen, and yet in a degree very li-
mited to what -is alleged, does not always happen ;
and, when it really does take
place, it feems rather to be the companion and promoter of libidinous gratification*
than a principal and effential promoter of conception. To many women the em-
braces of the male are extremely, if not completely, indifferent; and to fome they
are abfolutely difagreeable ;
yet even thefe women are prolific. There is no difficul-
ty in fuggefting a very fufficient and natural reafon why the parts of the female, di-
rectly fubjected .
to the action of the penis, during the venereal congrefs, fhould
become turgid with influent blood, and fometimes be conftridted. Nature, though
fhe feem3 in general unfriendly to exceffive luft, fometimes permits it ;
and, thefe
are the means file feems to have appointed for heightening it. Befides, it is propel'
that the animal inftindt, which prompts the reproduction of the fpecies, fhould not
be difappointed in its gratification, however brutal thefe fenfations and ideas may
appear to the purified philofopher. Thefe means then* however they may contri-
bute to the mutual fenfibility of the fexes, in the voluptuous gratification of animal
pleafure, appear to have no real influence on the procefs of generation, after the ve-
nereal congrefs has ceafed >nay, we have reafon to believe that their adtion or influ-
ence does not extend beyond the limits of the vagina, except in common with the
reft of the genital fyftem, even during that congrefs. If an afflux of bloo& to thefe
parts were always to be attended with fhefe effedts, what violence muft the ovaria
be expofed to by reiterated coition, and by every return of the menftrual difcharge ?
During the menftrual afflux, a very confiderable diftenfion muft furely take place
over the greateft part, if not the whole, of the genital fyftem; and, as this turgidity
is the principal reafon affigned for the adtion of the tubes, by what means are the
fimbriee diverted from exercifing thofe fundtions which turgidity, though from ano-
ther caufe, at another time fo fuccefsfully inftigates ? All'o, how happens it that grate-
ful copulation is not always productive, and the contrary; that the fimbrise, in
3 every
4
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 295
every venereal a6fc, do not operate upon the ovaria, and thereby produce more foe-
tufes, or a wafte of the ova ? and that the organs themfelves are not incapacitated, or
diminiflied in their energy, by fuch repeated exertions? We have every reafon then
to concfude, that the tenfion and conftridtion of the female organs, induced by the
afflux of blood during coition, if of confequence, are intended folely to promote
animal gratification ;
and, that they have no direct influence on the actual progrefs of
the femen through the above-delcribed communications to the ovaria.
Upon the whole, it is certainly no ways equivocal, that the femen cannot, in any
manner, be applied to the ovaria by means of the fimbriae ;
thfeit it cannot afeend or
advance through the convolutions of the Fallopian tubes ;
that it cannot divaricate
and traverfe the compreffed uterus; and that it cannot even operate a paflage through
the rigid bulwark of the cervix uteri. The probability of the progrefs of the aura
Jeminalis, through the lame paths, is deftroved by the fame arguments ; and the
whimfical opinions founded on the prefence of animalcules in the femen, and on the
organic bodies furniihed by the lenten of both fexes, and, uniting in the uterus, as
far as this alleged aperture is concerned, muft ftand or fall by the fame fate. It
may feem however ftrange, that a dofitrine fo ancient, and fo univerfally believed,
fhould be fo eafily overthrown ;
and it may furnifh, to the fpeculative reader, unfa-
vourable ideas of the prefent ftate of medical literature. He may indeed wonder,
that, though every fcience has become rational and refpedtable by the exertions of
their cultivators, medicine alone has been able to refift the diligence of a thoufand
years ;
although it has been wrefted from the hands of nurfes, and its profeffion be-
come dignified and lucrative, it can fcarcely be laid, at this day, to afford one un-
queltionable idea. In the volumes of phyfiology, compiled by the molt learned phy-
ficians, and drawn from the rnoft learned fources, will the unconcerned philofopher
find the dogmata of medicine confident with Nature, or with common fenfe?
Hut fince the femen, in fome fiiape or other, contains that animating principle
which is indifpenfably neceffary to generation ;
and fince the ovaria as indifputably
produce fomething from whence a living creature is to be evolved, it becomes de-
monftrably clear, that the influence of the male feed mult be powerfully incorpora-
ted with the female, and directed to the ovaria, before this effeCt can poffibly take
place. We have already 1’een how this cannot happen; let us now endeavour to
point out a rational medium by which it may be accomplifhed. For this purpofe
we muft again return to the vagina, or canal of the uterus, as being the principal
organ on the part of the female, which actually contributes to propagation; and
without the full and complete ufe of which, impregnation cannot take place. It
therefore demands a very minute and attentive inveftigatiom

blood-veffels, nerves, and lymphatics. It commences from beneath, at the nym-
pnae, and, riling obliquely about five inches, is loft upon the uterus. Its capacity
is very different in different fubje&s, and in no very diftant periods of life in the
fame lubjech A very refpectable anatomift finifhes his defcription of it by laying,
it is membro virili Jecundum omnes dimeufiones accommodabilis. Its inner membrane,
though very uneven, is delicately fmooth, and, from its nervous texture, exquifite-
ly fenfible ;
the outer membrane is more fpongy and mufcular; and, the whole bo-
dy of the canal is very plentifully fupplied with blood-velfels, nerves, and lympha-
tics. We know little more of the lymphatics of tbefe parts, than that they are more
numerous proportionally than in any other part of the body. Thole which origi-
nate in the exteiior parts of the female genital fyftem, traverfe the inguinal glands,
while the deep-feated ones take a much more direbt courfe to their place of union
with the lacteals; but of tbefe we Avail be more particular, w hen we adduce our ob-
servations in favour of a very powerful abforption fubfifting in the vagina.
The entrance into the canal of the uterus from without, is guarded by the
nymphae, which form an eminence on each fide, fo peculiarly conltructed and ar-
ranged, that we mult think lightly of the phyfiologift who could fuppole them to be
only appendages in office to the urethra. Indeed, as Nature frequently operates
more than one end by a particular ftrucfure, we ffiall not pretend to limit the fe-
condary or inferior offices which the nymphae may promote ;
but we fee much rea-
fon to believe them created to affift powerfully in preventing the fpeedy efcape of the
male femen, and thereby expoffng it longer to the afition of the abforbent fyftem.
A multitude of circumftances corroborate this belief; and it wall not be impaired
by the allegation, that thefe ridges by no means conltitute a regular and complete
valve. Immediately wdthin this barrier, a ftrucfure, on the fame principles as thofe
of the nymphae, hut more elegant and powerful, commences; and it is continued
over the furface of the vagina, gradually growing finer, till it is loft in fmoothnefs
near the upper extremity of the canal. This ftrubture is the rugae of the vagina, fo
accurately drawn and defcribed by Haller and others ;
but degraded by fome ana-
tomifts, who mark it only as ul’eful in exciting venereal enjoyment, or admitting
expanfion during coition and parturition. It is infatuating a mean and dilgraceful
reflection on the important order and operations of Nature to fuppofe, that thefe
rugae, which are not calually arranged, but are regulated with as much precifion
and uniformity as we can trace in any other part of the genital fyftem ; I fay it is
nugatory and preiumptuous to aflert, that this intricate, extenfive, and beautifuf,
arrangement, has been fo minutely laboured for no other purpofe, but merely to
excite
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 2 r/
excite a greater titillation during the grofs and libidinous commerce of the Texes,
and a greater extenfion during parturition. This ftruCture may indeed promote
thefe fecondary purpofes; but it is intended for much nobler ends. Had thefe
rug® been conftmfited merely for fnnple contraction and dilatation, they v/ould
have covered equally the whole furface of the vagina, which certainly does not hap-
pen ;
neither, if thefe had been their principal ules, would they be fo foon and fo
eafily obliterated. We believe, then, that the rug® of the vagina are thus contrived,
principally to protraCt the femen in that Vifcus, after the penis is withdrawn, and
thereby to favour abforption ;
efpecially as the qualities of the femen coincide won-
derfully with thefe intentions.
The femen, as it is fecreted from the blood in the tefticles, is very different from
that heterogeneous mixture which is expelled by the urethra in coition ;
though,
by the alteration, its fecundating quality is not improved. When it is conveyed
into the veficles, it is of a thin confidence, of a pale yellowifli colour, and little in
quantity. In thefe veficles it is fomewhat infpiffated, and its colour heightened
;
and, after it is mixed with the liquor of the proftrate glands, it becomes Till thicker,
and of a more whitifh colour. This confiftence which the femen acquires in its
progrefs from the tefticles, may produce other flight properties ;
but the principal
intention of it feems to be, to correfpond more effectually with the abforbent power
of the vagina: for thus, by the increafed tenacity of the femen, the remora of its
fecundating part muft be protracted in the vagina, while at the fame time the ab-
forbents are allowed more time to attach thole active fubtile parts intended to be
carried into the circulating fyftem. We may add here, in order farther to confirm
the opinion concerning the ule of the tenacity of the femen, that, when too little of
this mucilage is derived from the glands, or when it is of a depraved or thin qua-
lity, the whole mixture elcapes the machinery of the vagina too rapidly, and hence
coition becomes unproductive. This is the feminal ferofity, as it is called, held
to be one of the few7
caufes of fterility in man. And we may add farther, that,
when.the confcnt and power of procreation begins to fail on the part of the woman,
the crenulations of the vagina are then always vifibly decayed, whether effected by
the advances of age, or by imprudently-reiterated venery. But what are we to
think of a very refpectable author, who gravely tells us, that the femen, by ftagna-
tion, and by the addition of the cream-like liquor of the proftrate glands, is better
fuited to the projecting effort of the urethra in the event of coition? Indeed, it is
not to be denied, that the increafe in quantity of the feminal mixture may enable
the projectile power of the urethra, with its aiding mufcles, to act with greater effi-
cacy ;
but a boy would laugh in my face were I to tell him, that by adding to the

weight and tenacity of water, his fquirt would throw it much farther. To ad in con-
cert, then, with thefe unqueftionable qualities of the femen, the furface of the va-
gina, by means of its rug®, from their elevation and arrangement, muft have a very
confiderable efifed in heightening the remora we have defcribed. No doubt, if Na-
ture had only had in view the prevention of the regrefs of the femen, we might have
met with a much fimpler mechanifm ;
but, as to this part very different offices, and
all of them material, were allotted, it has been intricately qualified for them all.
Thus, upon the whole, we fee an admirable difpofition in the femen, and in the fur-
face of the vagina, to facilitate and promote the adtion of the abforbent veffels.
Though the abforbent fyftem has not been traced with the fame minutenefs and
fuccefs which have followed the inveftigation of the fanguiferous fyftem, it is how-
ever known to be very general, and very powerful, and it is remarkably fo in the
cavity of the pelvis. How, otherwife, is that efifufion which is conftantly going on,
in order to lubricate the whole genital fyftem in the female, and to prevent the coalef-
cence or concretion of its fides, refumed ? In thole unfortunate females whole
menfes have taken place, but in whom likewife the expulfion of them has been
prevented by the unruptured hymen, or by unnatural membranes blocking up the
paffage, much of the blood has always been reforbed ;
and in thofe whole difeafe
has exifted long, and where the thick parts of the blood have begun to be broken
down, the colluvies has been reforbed, and a train of fymptoms induced, not to be
accounted for by the mere turgidity which this obftrudion occafioned. The infec-
tion and progrefs of fyphilis, or confirmed lues, not only eftablifhed the certainty of
a very rapid and powerful abforption in the vagina; but all’o exhibit the power and
influence of the irregularities of its furface. It is furely very evident, that the chief
application of the venereal virus, whether in gonorrhoea or fyphilis, but'efpecially
in gonorrhoea, muft be near the farther extremity of the vagina, though there can
be no doubt but the ulcerated glans may often afifedt the exterior parts by its intro-
duction ; but, in a confirmed lues, the fundus of the vagina is rarely the feat of ulcer,
and it is never affedted in gonorrhoea. Here, the furface of the vagina being moftly
fmooth, the poifon runs dowmwards, till falling upon the rugae, it is there inter-
cepted and retarded. Here then the poifon is multiplied, and leifurely applied to
the mouths of the lymphatics, through w hich it is carried into the blood ; where,
affimilating together, it contaminates the whole mafs. Though the progrefs of the
fypbilitic potion is not always thus regular, the variations do not afifedt the opinion.
When the lymphatics, and their glands, are vigorous and eafily permeable; when
the application of the venereal virus is within the nymphte ;
and, when it is fuf-
ficiently adtive, the firft fymptoms of difeafe arife from general contamination

and
AND TITE OCCULT SCIENCES. m
and, were this poifon always very mild, and taken up by the abforbents within the
nymphas, there is no doubt but the whole trials would alrnoft always be difeafed,
without much chance of ulcer or preceding bubo. But there are many circum-
ftances which tend to retard the fpeedy abforption of the fyphilitic virus, even when
it is extremely afitive; and, among thefe, the inflammation which in general it mutt
induce, is not perhaps the leaft confiderable ;
but thefe cannot affect the abforption
of the feminal fluid of the male. The fyphilitic virus too, may, from the laxity and
lubricity of the vagina, (a circumftance very general in immodeft women, ) not only
efcape abforption, but may be carried outwards, to exercife its energy on the exter-
nal parts. And it is from thefe reafons partly, that immodeft women are fo little
dilpofed to conception, and that modeft women, when fubjefited to venereal infec-
tion, generally experience the more latent and violent fpecies of this difeafe. And,
as a greater furface of abforbents is expofed in the female to the contaminating in-
fluence of the difeafed male organs, and as the greateft part of the female genital
fyftem has a much readier intercourfe with the blood than through the inguinal
glands, we meet with this fpecies of fyplnlis much oftener in women than in men.
The cure of fyphilis, too, by fpecific remedies introduced into the vagina, fully de-
monftrates the ftrength and activity of the lymphatics in this canal. Is there then
a ready and eftablifhed communication, for difeafe, and for its remedies, between
the vagina and the general circulating fyftem of the blood, while a mild fluid, yet
poflefled of activity infinitely beyond that of any poifon, and created for the higheft
and belt of purpofes, is not permitted to traverfe the fame channels ? Many other
corroborating circumftances, both in fafit and in analogy, might be adduced here,
were not thefe arguments in themfelves conc.lufive.
In a due ftate of health there is what may be called an inteftine motion in the
blood, occafioning and promoting its commixture, as well as its feparation. In all
general difeafes, and even in many which are called local, this inteftine motion is
heightened, diminiihed, or deranged ;
and in the exanthematous or eruptive dif-
orders, it mult be remarkably fo. In fyphilis, though this difeafe is not direfilly ex-
anthematous, there mult be exceflive dilturbance, and certain depravation prevailing
throughout the whole fyftem, before fuch complete deftrufilion can be brought upon
it. In thefe cafes of difeafe, where vehement infefition, with all its confequences,
is overturning all before it, we have always found, that milder infections could make
no impreffion. Hence the practitioner never hefitates to ingraft the lmall-pox,
though the patient may have already received the difeafe, either by natural conta-
gion, or by prior inoculation : hence a milder difeafe is often removed by a feverer
one ;
hence flow confumption is always retarded, and often overcome, by fecunda-
tion ;
300 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
tion; and hence fecundation itfelf, as the feebler ftiraulus, is often prevented by
the anticipating difturbance of fyphilis, or of fnnilar difeafes vehemently pre-occu-
pying the circulating fyftem. It is this anticipation, this prior poffeflion, and change
in the circulating blood, which reafonably and emphatically accounts for the want
of influence in the human femen upon the female after impregnation has fully taken
place, or while the mother is providing milk. And we might account for the pro-
duction of twins, triplets, and thofe rare inftances of more numerous progeny, from
the fame circumftances. One,'two, or more, ova may indeed be fo ripe as to meet
completely the fecundating impnlfe of the male femen at one time ;
and it is perhaps
moreftrange that the different foetufes fhould be maturated and expelled about the
fame time, than if a greater period intervened between the expullion of each ;
and
might not a fecond intercourfe of the fexes be fuccefsful, when the female circula-
ting mafs was not fully pre-occupied by the influence of the firft? But the extent
and influence of prior infection, or impregnation of the blood, has been better ob-
ferved in the venereal, than in any other, difeafe, or natural occurrence. Women,
whole general fyftem is vitiated by the fyphilitic virus, are always incapable of con-
ception ;
or if the vitiation is not complete, but in a flight degree, an imperfect fecun-
dation may take place ;
but its product determines the want of energy, and the
unqualified ftate of the mother from whence it drew its principal arrangement.
Thefe ideas are corroborated by the mode of cure adopted in the circumftances we
have been deferibing, and by the general effects of it.
Thus we have endeavoured, and we hope with fuccefs, to eftablifh the truth of a
ftrong power of abforption in the genital fyftem of the female, originating in the
vagina; and a difpofition in the whole mafs of blood, to be affeCled according to
the properties of what may be mingled with it. And as, from the prefent ftate of
anatomical knowledge, we have no right to fufpect any other mode than this of ab-
forption, by which the unrejected and finer parts of the femen can in any fhape, and
with anv effect, be determined towards the ovaria, let us lee how this can be farther
afeertairied by what we may fuppofe to be the effect of the abforbed femen, and the
future appearances of impregnation.
In human creatures the evolution of all their parts is gradual, and the work of
time. From the moment in which the ovarian nucleus receives the vivifying im-
pulfe from the femen, till the period of puberty; from the dawn of its exiftence, to
the completion of its figure and its powers ;
its alterations are fo many, and fo va-
ried, that our idea of the germ is not recognifable in that of the infant, and our idea
of the infant again is loft in that of the perfect animal. A gelatinous particle,
without neceffary form and texture, becomes a ftupendous fabric, fo intricate and
elaborate, though at the lame time perfect and complete, that human ingenuity

and reafon have toiled almoft fruitlefsly for thoufands of years in inveftigating the
progrefs. It has indeed been averred by fome, that all the different organs of the
animal in its complete ftate are original and diftinct in the embryo, and are only
unfolded and rendered more evident by its increafe. This furely is not the cafe.
The animal is certainly endowed with power of completing itfelf; and can, from
inorganized parts, produce an organized ftruGture. The parts are only evolved
and perfected as they become ufeful in the different ftages ;
and the evolution of
many of them can be prevented without the destruction of life, or excefiive pre-
judice to thofe already evolved. If the different organs, or rather principles, are
at firft perfeCt, why are thole effeCts which depend upon them not perfeCt alfo ?
Why is the ftate of infancy a ftate of idiotifm ? why is the temper of youth capri-
cious and flexible ? and why are the temper and paflions of the adult but barely
difcernible in the preceding ftages?
As wr
e are of opinion then, that the different organs are matured only as they be-
come requifite and neceflary, confequently, we believe the evolution of the gene-
rative organs in both fexes muft be among the laft efforts of the increafe and com-
pletion of the body. This evolution could not have taken place earlier : if it had,
the mind muft have been affected by thofe impulfes which announce the maturation
of thefe organs, by which we know’ the mind, body, and foul, are connected. In
the male, the foundation and powers of maturation of that ftrength and of thofe
more rational qualities which belong to him are laid to ripen with puberty : hence
communication with the female, before thefe are finally arranged and fecured,
proves inefficient, and entails upon him debility both of body and mind. The fame
thing holds, as far as the fame ends are concerned, with refpeCt to the female ;
and
we cannot fuppofe that Nature could be fo idly eccentric, as to punifh the female
with a difpofition or propenfity to procreate, before the body was capable of under-
going the various diforders and dangers of pregnancy and parturition. For the fame
reafons, none of the ordinary organs of fenfe are qualified *o receive or commu-
nicate diftinCt impreffions, till the brain, the feat of the foul, as the heart is of life,
has acquired thole properties which muft fit it for its arduous offices. It is only
when the different organs of fenfe have been completely evolved, and all their parts
found and juft, that the power of the mind is effectuated and eftablifhed. This fa-
culty, though it feems effentially different from Reafon, is no doubt the origin of
it; for the extenfion of common fenfe, from memory, or rather from compaiifon,
and what may be called the balance of the fenfes, conftitutes w'hat is called Reafon
and Judgment. While the organs are incomplete, from infancy or from difeafe,
their communication with the underftanding is alfo incomplete. Thofe who have
been born blind, or whofe eyes have been deftroyed in infancy, before they were
No. 20. 4 II become
302 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
become ufeful, have none of thofe ideas which depend upon the eye it is the
fame with the deaf, and in all cafes of ideas depending upon one fenfe : and we
may add, the early caftrated have no comprehenfion of, or propenfity to, the gra-
tifications of love. Do not thefe things fliow—and a thoufand other circumltances
might be adduced to ftrengthen the proof—that the mind acquires its powers only
as the parts of the body are unfolded, and confirmed ;
that the body is perfected
only as the mind is qualified to receive its impreffions ;
and that the parts of the
body are perfected by one another ? »
During infancy and youth, ftriclly, the ovaria are fimple inorganic maffes, par-
taking of no more life than is barely fufficient to fuftain them, and connect them
with that energy and progrefs of conftitution which are afterwards to unfold all their
properties. At the period of puberty, thus denominated from the change which
takes place in the genital fyftem at this time of life, this progrefs and developement
of the ovaria is finifhed by Nature; and thofe bodies are generated and completed
within them, which will exift without impregnation by the male, but which this
impregnation alone can finally maturate and evolve. That thefe bodies are not ge-
nerated at an earlier date, Anatomy as well as Reafon, founded on the foregoing
arguments, afliire us ;
and, that the ova of all the fcetufes, which the female is af-
terwards to produce, are generated at that time, feems equally certain. Though
this change in the ovaria is the moft effential, the whole genital fyftem alfo under-
goes a very material change. The fimple alterations of ftrufiture and dimenfions in
the different parts of this fyftem, though they are neceffary and fubfcrvient to gene-
ration and parturition, yet they are not fo material, either in themfelves, or to our
purpofe, as to require a minute defcription. This, however, is not the cafe with
refpeft to the menfes. It is chiefly with a view to the nutrition of the foetus that
the extra-languification in the female is provided by Nature ;
which is determined
to the genital fyftem, in the fame manner as the other fluids are determined to other
outlets ;
but, as the continued drilling off of this extra blood would be exceedingly
inconvenient and difgufting, Nature has prepared, as it were, a ciftern for its re-
ception. What may be fufficient to bring on the haemorrhage, however, is only
accumulated ;
and the general redundancy, induced by the obltrufilion and accu-
mulation, fubfides gradually as the haemorrhage goes on. This is the manner of
menftruation in the unimpregnated female, and thefe are the reafons why it affumes
a periodical form. In the impregnated female again, the preparation of extra blood
ltill continues, but its confumption becomes very different. By the extenfion of the
uterus, and by the vvafte occafioned by the nourifliment of the foetus and its involu-
cra, the furcharge or extra-preparation of blood is nearly balanced, or is taken up
as it is prepared ;
and hence the periodical efforts are almoft loft. In the firft months
of
303
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES.
of pregnancy, however, the uterine fyftein is not always able to confume the fur-
charge of blood, and thereby take off the periodical effort; and hence it is that the
lofs of the foetus happens moft generally in the early months, and at the ulual peiiod
of the menfes, unlefs feme accident has fupervened. And it is nearly from the
fame reafons that mifcarriage is fo often to be apprehended in the latter months of
pregnancy, and that the foetus is afterwards expelled from the womb. When the
foetus has acquired all that bulk and ftrength which the capacity and powers of the
uterus can confer ;
and when a change of circulation and mode of life becomes
neceffary to it, the uterus and foetus become plethoric ;
a general accumulation
fucceeds; and the periodical efforts of the menfes return. Duiing the middle
months of pregnancy the foetus is in a ftate of rapid growth, and is capable oi
confuming all the blood which the mother can furnith ;
but tneie is neither 100m
nor wafte, in the latter months, for the blood which the mother is conftantly pour-
ing in ;
and hence arifes that plethora, both in mother and child, which is to infti-
gate the effort to parturition, which occafions the eflufion after parturition, and
which is to fupply the extended circulation of the born child.
But befides the utility of menftruation to the foetus, there is a very evident con-
nection between it and impregnation. To fpeak of it as a proof of the ripened
qualifications of the female, is to fay nothing ;
its immediate adtion is effential to
conception. In the human female, it is well known that coition is almoft only l'uc-
cefsful immediately after this evacuation has fubfided. Who will reconcile this
—
and it is no modern and groundlefs obfervation—to the confequence which has been
afcribed to turgidity and tenfion, which we have already averted to? Almoft every
woman w ho has frequently undergone pregnancy, and who has attended judicioufly
to the phenomena of that fituation, calculates from the laft ceflation of the menfes.
At this time, or rather very foon after it, the plethoric tumult of the general fyftem
has completely fubfided, and the abforbed femen gets quiet and unanticipated poffef-
fion of the circulating blood ;
and at the fame time the gradually-returning plethora
promotes its adtion, and perhaps its determination to the ovaria. When the menfes
are interrupted, or profufe and frequent, impregnation feldom takes place ;
and it
admits not of a doubt, that when the determination of this blood is towards the
mammae, in the form of milk, coition is unfuccefsful ;
and, as foon as its determina
tion to the uterine fyftem is reftored, other things being favourable, copulation fuc-
ceeds. We may add as a known fact, that continuing to give fuck after the ufual
period will occupy the plethora, and prevent its determination, in the form of
, blood, to the uterine fyftem. It is an additional reproach to the grolfnefs of human
nature, that this pradtice hath too often been put into execution in order to obviate
conception. Sometimes there is reafon to believe that conception has taken place
2 whi]e
204 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
while the plethoric determination to the breafts continued. I am rather difpofed to
believe, that in fuch cafes its return to the uterine fyftem was recommenced; for
about the lame time the milk generally loles its alimentary qualities, and gradually
dwindles away.
But we have laid enough to delcribe and fubftantiate thole parts of the female
which puberty has prepared for generation. We {hall now confider its effects on the
male. It need not be repeated, that the feminal fluid is an exceedingly penetrating
and active fluid. Its effects, after it is generated, even upon the male, demon-
ftrate its activity and influence, far beyond the precinCts wherein we believe it to be
accumulated. After puberty, the fecretion of it, during even indifferent health,
is continually going on ;
and thole collections of it in its refervoirs, which are not
thrown out by venereal exercife, or by other means lefs decent, are reforbed and
mingled with the general mafs. What is actually reforbed about the period of pu-
berty, before the lyltem has been habituated to it, or faturated with it, produces very
curious and remarkable effects over the whole body. The flefli and ikin, from be-
ing tender, delicate, and irritable, become coarfe and firm ;
the body in general
lofes its fiicculency; and a new exiftence feems to take place. The voice, a proof
of the tenlion and rigidity of the mufcular fibre, lofing its tendernefs and inequali-
ties, becomes ungratefully harfli ;
and the mind itlelf, actuated by the progrefs of
the body, and forgetting all its former inclinations and attachments, acquires dif-
tinCtly new propenfities and paflions. Thefe changes are not entirely the effect of
ordinarily-progreffive age and ftrength ;
neither are they promoted by intercourle
with the w'orld ;
for caftration will anticipate them, and premature venery, or even
gradual familiarity, and early onanifm, will diminifli them. Boys who have been
fubjeCted to caftration never acquire either that ftrength of body or capacity of
mind which dignifies the complete male ,
and the fame cruel and unnatural opera-
tion performed on brute animals, diminiihes their bodily ftrength, their courage,
and the fiercenefs of their temper.
If fuch are the effects of the feminal fluid when reforbed by the male, how pow-
erful muft it be when luddenly mingled, and moft probably in greater quantity,
with the circulating fluids of the attracting female ! Coition, or rather the abforp-
tion of the feminal fluid of the male by the female, even when not fucceeded by im-
pregnation, induces an alteration very general over the female fyftem. The local
influence of which may be inferred from the general change which it is capable of
inducing during complete health ;
from the relief which it effectuates in many fpe-
eies of difeafe ; and from the general vivacity and cheerfulnefs diffufed over the
whole animal frame. It would be prolix to go over every difeafe which will warrant
thefe opinions; yet, in the eye of common obfervation, the fallow and inanimate
female,

female, by coition, often becomes plump and robuft, and beautiful and afitiye,
while the widow, or married woman, deprived of commerce with her hufband,
gradually x'eturns to the imperfections and peculiarities of Angle life ;
and that the
ancient virgin, all her life deprived of this animating effluvia, is generally confumed
with infirmity, ill-temper, or difeafe. It is well known, too, that the want of coi-
tion at the time of life when Nature feems to require it, induces many diforders in
females ;
and that the ufe of it removes thefe, and even other difeales. Chloroiis,
or the whites, almoft always attack females immediately after puberty; and, even
when the violence of its fymptoms have not been difcerned till a later period, its
origin can always be traced back to that time. When the human fyftem is com-
pletely evolved, and all its parts have acquired their full growth, a balance is pro-
duced between the circulating and l’olid fyftems ;
though, from the ideas we have
fuggefted concerning the menfes, this balance in the female cannot ftrifitly be called
complete. It is only complete in her when in perfefit health, and in an impregna-
ted ftate ;
at other times, the catamenia, as preponderating againft the powers of
the folid fyftem, in proportion to the degree of their period, difturb the equilibrium,
and thereby more or lets induce a ftate inconfiftent with perfect health. But when
the propelling power of growth has ceafed before the folids, either from adtual dif-
eafe, or want of uniformity in either period, or acceflion with refpect to the progrefs
of the circulating fyftem, have acquired their proper vigour and tone ;
and when
the catamenia has affirmed its deftination, before it is accompanied by the general as
well as local energy which is requifite to expel it ;
an univerfal want of balance comes
on ;
the blood lofes its ftimulating influence on the vitiated folids, and thefe, in
their turn, a6t feebly on the diftempered blood. Accordingly, in the cure of this
difeafe, no matter whether adopted from particular theories or from experience,
medicines are directed to reftore vigour to the folids, and confidence and ftimulus
to the circulating mafs. Nature proceeds in the fame manner; and the beneficial
effects of coition in the cure of this difeafe have been too material to efcape obferva-
tion. It may be alleged, that thefe effects depend entirely upon local influence
;
and that even voluptuous gratification, by quieting the turbulence of paffion, is of
ccnlequence in the cure. We {hall not fay that thefe things are unavailing; for it
appears that the relief obtained is chiefly owiDg to the increafed inteftine motion,
and confequent ftimulus, communicated to the blood by the abforbed femen, where-
by the folids themfelves are ultimately reftored ;
and we are the more confirmed in.
this opinion, becaufe all thefe fortunate effects attend, whether coition be fucceeded
by impregnation or not. Hyfterics, and other difeales, would furnifh us with fimi -
lar explanations and fimilar cures.

306 A KEY TO PHYSIC,
Let us now advance a little nearer our objeCt; It is beyond a doubt, that, in what-
ever manner the femen a6ts upon the female, it does not a6l fuddenly, notwithftand-
ing the general affections of many authors. However productive coition ihay be,
the fecundated produ6t of the ovaria is not immediately difengaged. We dare not
avouch this fa6t from obfervations made on the human fubjeCt, becaufe fuch obfer-
vations never have been attempted, nor ever can with the fmalleft probability of
fuccefs : but the diflection of brutes, by the moft eminent anatomifts, with a direct
view to the elucidation of this fa6t, afcertains it as far as fuch evidence can be ad-
mitted. In the direction of fmall animals by De Graaff, he found no dilcernible
alteration in the uterus during the firft forty hours after coition, but a gradual
change was perceivable in the ovaria; and what he fuppofed the ripened origin of
the future animal, at the end of that time, lofing its tranfparency, become opaque
and ruddy. After that time, the fimbrim were found clol’ely applied to the ovaria;
the cavities from whence the ova had been expreffed were difcernible; and about
the third day the ova were difcovered in the uterus. In large animals, and in thofe
whole time of uterine geftation wr
as longer, it was found that the progrefs which we
have been defcribing was proportionally flower. The fame experiments have been
made by different anatomifts, and perhaps with very different views ;
and, though
they have not always been managed with the fame judgment and dexterity, yet all
of them more or lefs confirm the idea that there is a very confiderable lapfe of
time intervening between productive copulation and the expulfion of the ovum from
the ovaria. But if this is the cafe with animals which foon arrive at puberty, and
which, like human creatures, copulate not perfeCfly before puberty, —whole live$
are fhort, and progrefs in equal periods of time more rapid than thofe in man, —by
parity of reafon, it muff happen, that in w omen the period between impregnation
and the expulfion of the fecundated produCt of the ovaria muft be confiderably
greater than what has been obferved to take place in thefe animals. If all this is
true—how are we to fuppofe Nature to be employed during this interval ? We be-
lieve it is during this period that the whole female conftitution is labouring under the
fecundating influence of the feroinal fluid taken into the blood by the abforbents;
while the ovaria are largely participating, and their product ripening, by means oi
the general ftimulating procefs. And the fame procefs which maturates the ovum
tends to facilitate its exclufion. The ovaria, as well as their produCt, are at this
time enlarged, and other changes, fubjeCt to the examination of our lenfes, indu-
ced. It is no proof againft the reality of this general alteration in the circumftances
of the circulating fyftem, and confequent revolution in the ovaria, that the whole is
accomplilhed with but little vifible dilturbance, either local or univerlal. In other

Cafes of material alteration in the mafs of blood, equal quietnefs and obfcurity pre-
vail. In fcrophulous or fcorbutic taints; in the inoculated fmall-pox, or when they
are produced by contagion; the poifon filently and flowly diffufes itfelf throughout
the whole mafs, and a highly-morbid ftate is imperceptibly induced. Thus, an
adtive and infinuating poifon intimately mixes itfelf with all the containing, per-
haps, as well as contained, parts, perverts their natures, and is ready to fall upon
and deftroy the very powers of life, before one fymptom of its adtion or of its influ-
ence has been difeerned. It is the fame in a confirmed lues, and it is even more re-
markable in the hydrophobia derived from the bite of a mad dog; and the whole
round of contagious difeales have the fame unalarming, yet certain, progrefs and
termination.
That the final influence of this elaborate procefs Ihould be determined particu-
larly, and at all times, to the ovaria, is no w7
ay marvellous. To qualify the ovaria
for this, they are iupplied with a congeries of blood-veflels and nerves, at puberty
larger and more numerous than w'hat is allotted to any other part of fimilar magni-
tude. Were the ovaria merely a receptacle for the ova, which the venereal orgafin
communicated by the nerves, or by the impulfion of the applied femen, was to la-
cerate; what ufe would there be for fo intricate and extenfive an arrangement of
blood-veflels and nerves ? But we may farther remark, that every diftinct procefs
in the human body, either during health or difeafe, tends to one particular and d if-
tindt purpofe. The kidneys do not fecrete bile, nor does the liver ftrain off the
ufelefs or hurtful parts of the blood which are deftined to pafs off by the emulgents;
neither do the falivary and bronchial glands promifeuoufly pour out mucus or laliva;
the variolous virus does not produce a morbiilous eruption, fyphilitic caries, or
fcrophulous ulcer; why then fhould the fecundated blood unconcernedly and pro-
mifeuoufly determine its energy to the fkin, the lymphatics, or the fubftance of the
bones ? We know none of the operations in the human body, deftined for the or-
dinary purpofes of life and health, or for the removal of difeafe, but in a greater or
lefs degree involve the machinery of the whole fyftem. A Angle mouthful of food,
while it is prepared, purified, and applied to its ultimate purpofes, is fubjedted to
the action of all the known parts of the bbdy, and without doubt to all thofe parts
the properties of whiph we are unacquainted with ; a draught of cold water fpreads
its influence almolt inftantaneoufly from one extremity to the other ; the flighteft
wound difturbs even the remoteft parts, and is followed, not unfrequentlv, with
the moft unhappy effects; an almoft invifible quantity of poifon fets the whole frame
in torture, and all the active powers of the body inftinclively exert themfelves to
folicit its expulfion. —Can we diftinguiffi thefe things, and admire them, and then
fuppofe
SOS A KEY TO PHYSIC,
fuppofe that the moft material operation of the huma'n body—the renovation of it-
felf—is to be accompiilhed in a corner, and with infinitely lefs formality and folem-
nity than a fpittle is call upon the wind ? The evident means are fufficiently degra-
ded ;
we need not exert our ingenuity to degrade them farther.
It is during this interval, between productive coition and the exclufion of the
ovum from the ovaria, that likenefs, hereditary difeafes, and the like, are commu-
nicated and acquired. Inftead of that influence which the imagination of the mo-
ther is fuppofed to pofiefs over the form of the child, might we not fufpedt, that the
feminal fluid of the male, co-operating, during this interval, with the influence of
the female upon the ovum, inftigated a likenefs, according to the influence of the
male and female tinctures, in the united principles ? It is during this period only
that the difeafes of the male can be communicated to the child; and, if we admit
not of this interval and general operation of the feminal fluid, we cannot fee how
they can be communicated, though thofe of the mother may be communicated then
or at a much later period, confidering how the child is nourifhed while it is in the
uterus and at the breaft. It may be urged againft this early and eff'edtual acquifi-
tion of likenefs, that the foetus does not acquire even the divifion of its largeft mem-
bers till long after its exclufion from the ovaria: but then we are confident, that,
as the foetus takes all its form and other properties from the active fubtilty of thefe
blended tinctures, we cannot fee any reafon why it lhould not poflefs this hereditary
faculty, in common with the reft. If likenefs depend upon the imagination of
the female, how happens it that the children of thofe whofe profligate manners ren-
der the father uncertain, and whofe afiedtions ceafe with the inftant of libidinous
gratification, are as frequently diftinguilhable by their likenefs as thofe children
who have been born under none of thefe misfortunes ? If the features are not plan-
ted during this period, and if imagination be not idle or ufelefs, how was the fix-
fingered family, mentioned by Maupertuis, continued? When a female of that fa-
mily married a man w ho had only the ufual number of fingers, the deformity of her
family became uncertain, or ceafed ;
and we inuft fuppofe her imagination could
not have been inactive or diminiflied, whether alarmed by the fear of continuing a
deformed race, or inftigated by the vanity of tranfmitting fo remarkable a peculia-
rity. Were imagination, in a pregnant woman, fo powerful as many have endea-
voured to reprefent it, the mother, profligate at heart, though not actually wicked,
would always betray the apoftafy of her afiedtions ;
and even a virtuous woman
might divulge that Hie had looked with as much eagernels atahandfome ftranger
as flie had looked at the aquiline nofe or other prominent feature of her hufband.

But, admitting that the ferrtinal fluid of every male poffeffes fome kind of influence
peculiar to that male, and connected with his form, as well as his conftitution ;
in.
the fame, or in fome fimilar manner, it contains, notwithftanding the elaboratenefs
of its preparation, the ftamina of diffeafes,. fome of which often lie longer dormant
than even the features of individuals ;
that the ova are as peculiarly conftrufiled,
by the conftitution of the female, as any other parts which depend upon gradual
and folitary evolution; and that thefe, operating upon each other by the interven-
tion of the general fyftem of the female, may, according to the power or prevalence
of either, affe6t the features and figure of the incipient animal, or rather the inorga-
nized mafs from which the features and figure of the animal are afterwards to be
evolved : admitting all thefe things, will national, or even more extenfive, fimilitude
corroborate the opinion?
While men continue in the fame climate, and even in the fame diftrict, an uni-
form particularity of features and figure prevails among them, little affefited by all
thole changes which improve or degrade the mind ;
but when they migrate, or when
they are corrupted by the migration of others, this national diftinfition in time is loft,
though in the latter cafe it feems to be recoverable, unlefs the caufe of change be
continued. —The beautiful form and features of the ancient Greeks are at this day
difcernible in their defeendants, though they are debated by intercourfe with ftran-
gers, and by forms of government ultimately affefiting their conftitutions ;
the de- 1
lcendants of the few who by chance or defign have been obliged to fettle among the
ugly tribes in the extremities of the North, have, by their intercourfe with thefe
tribes, and by neceffarily accommodating themfelves to the fame modes of life, be-
fides other circumftances, become equally ugly; and the Jew himfelf, though he
abhors to mingle with a different nation, and though his mode of life is nearly the
fame in all climates, yet the fettlement of his anceftors in any one particular climate
for fome centuries will very fenfibly impair the charafileriftic features of his people.
As equally in point, and lefs liable to queftion, we may mention the following fimi-
lar obfervations. A Scotchman, an Englifhman, a Frenchman, or a Dutchman,
may, even without their peculiarities of drefs, be almoft always dittinguifhed in
their very pifilures ;
the fturdy and generous Briton, notwithftanding the fhortnefs
of the period, and the uninterrupted intercourfe, is traced with uncertainty in the
effeminate and cruel Virginian : and the Negroes in North America, whofe families
have continued finee the firft importation of thefe unhappy creatures, and whofe
modes ot living, exclufive of their flavery, are not materially changed, are much
lefs remarkable for the flat nofe, big lips, ugly legs, and long heels, than their ancef-
tors were, or than thofe who are direfilly imported from the fame original nation.
No. 20. .4 K From
310 A KEY TO PIIYSIC,
From tbefe obfervations it feems allowable to infer, that, though climate, manners,
occupation, or imitation, cannot materially affeCt the form or features of the exit-
ing animal, yet thefe circumftances, becoming the lot of a feries of animals, may,
by inducing a change in the general mafs both of the male and female, be the remote
caufe of a change in their product.
After what has been premiled, it feems rational to conclude, that the prolific fluid,
in coition, is neither carried through the Fallopian tubes, nor protruded through
the aperture of the uterus, to the ovaria; but that it is taken up by the ablorbent
veflels, and conveyed into the fanguiferous fyftem, wffiere indeed every aCtive prin-
ciple that can poffibly affect the human conititution is alfo conveyed. That, after
circulating through the blood, it is by, its natural impulfe, and the additional fti-
mulus acquired from the mother, forced through the correlponding veflels into the
ovaria; where, if it finds one or more of the'ova in a ftate fit or ripe for impregna-
tion, conception takes place. accordingly: and either one or more are impregnated,
as the maturated ftate of the ovaria might happen to be. But if none of the ova or
eggs are in a ftate fufficiently mature, or chance to be injured by any offending hu-
mours, by debility, or difeafe, in either of thefe cafes impregnation is fruftrated, juft
the fame as happens to an addled egg, or to a damaged grain of corn thrown into
the earth.
On the other hand, if the male organ be deficient in vigour, or the femen be defec-
tive in quantity, cohfiftency, or aCtive power, it then fails of ftimulating the female
fluid, and is incapable of influencing impregnation. In order therefore that the a6b
of copulation fhould be productive, the male muft unqueftionably convey to the
female an elaborate tinCture, which pofiefles the eflence of his .whole fyftem, as
well mental as corporeal. In this aCt, the utmoft energy and powers of the
mind, of the body, and of the foul, are intimately connected; and all contribute
their particular influence to the feed; of which every father muft be fenfible, when
he recollects the aCtion of the heart, the feat of life —of the brain, the feat of the
foul —and of the whole powers of the body, concentrated and impelled, as it were,,
through the genital fyftem. —That this liquor comprehends the aCtive principles of
body andfoul, will not I think be doubted by thofe who give the foregoing argu-
ments their proper weight; and that it conveys with it, more or lefs, the direct image
of the parent, I take to be confirmed by the evidence of Scripture ;
where we are told
that one abfolute and unequivocal form was given to man, in the exprefs image
of the Deity. So that man, thus organized and commiffioned, was doubtlefsly to
convey to future generations, that divine image or fignature which God had gra-
cioufly ftamped upon him. For this purpofe the feed of man, or efficient principle

of generation, muft be mingled with the vegetative fluid of the female ; and, being
attracted or taken up by the abforbent veflels from the uterine canal, pafles immedi-
ately into the circulating fyftem, where, afli inflating with the peculiar temperature
of the mother, and acquiring new energy from the enlivening quality of the blood,
it is directed through its natural channels to the ovaria, impregnating the germ by its
active quality, and conveying to it the peculiarities it had derived from the conftitu-
tions, forms, tempers, and difpofitions, of the parents, with the feeds of whatever
difeafes, impurities, or taints, were lurking in their blood. For from the blood and
brain is the male feed primarily elaborated, and into the female mafs is this thrown
and affimilated, before impregnation can poflibly take place. In the courfe of fix
days, I conclude the united tinctures to have travelled through the whole circula-
ting iyfiem—to have participated of the hereditary forms and peculiarities of the mo-
ther, and to have propelled the ovum or egg from its feat in the ovaria to a fufpend-
ed fituation in the womb, hanging by a minute thread, that afterwards becomes the
umbilical veffel, or aperture through which nourifliment and life is conveyed from
the mother to the child. The firft vifible ftate of conception, which refembles the
lucid appearance of a drop of water, tending to coagulation, is correctly fhown in
the firft figure of the annexed Plate, precifely in the ftate it was extracted from, the
uterus of a female who died on the fixth day after contact with the male.
At the time the ovum, or rudiments of the embryo, defcends into the womb, it is in-
deed very minute ;
but at the end of about thirty days, we may partly difcover the
firft lineaments of the foetus, though fmall and imperfect, being then only about the
fizeof a houfe-fly. Two little veficles appear in an almoft tranfparent jelly ;
the final! er
of which is intended to become the head of the foetus, and the larger one is deftined
for the trunk ;
but neither the limbs nor extremities are yet to be feen ;
the umbilical
cord appears only as a minute thread, and the placenta, which only refembles a
cloud above, has no ramifications, or appearances of blood-veflels. This ftate of
the embryo is exprefled in the fecond figure of the annexed Plate.
Towards the end of the fecond month, the foetus is upwards of an inch in length,
and the features of the face begin to be evolved. The nofe appears like a finaUpro-
minent line ;
and we are able to difcover another line under it, which is deftined for
the feparation of the lips. Two black points appear in the place of eyes, and two
minute holes mark the formation of the ears. At the fides of the trunk, both above
and below', we fee four minute protuberances, which are the rudiments of the arms
and legs. The veins of the placenta are alfo now partly vifible ;
as may be feen in
No, 3. of the Plate. 1 ‘

In the third month the human form may be decidedly ascertained ;
all the parts
of the face can be diftinguithed; the fhape of the body is clearly marked out; the
haunches and the abdomen are elevated, and the hands and feet are plainly to be
diftinguithed. The upper extremities are obferved to increafe fafter than the lower
ones ;
and the feparation of the fingers may be perceived before that of the toes.
The veins of the placenta are now diftended, and are feen to communicate with the
umbilical tube. This ftate of geftation is faithfully delineated in No. 4. of the
annexed Engraving.
In the fourth month the foetus feems to be completed in all its parts, and is about
four inches in magnitude. The fingers and toes, which at firft coalefced, are now
leparated from each other, and the inteftines appear, in all their windings and con-
volutions, like little threads. The veins of the placenta begin to be filled with
blood, and the umbilical cord is confiderably enlarged ;
as may be feen in the fifth
figure of the lubjoined Plate.
In the fifth month, the bodily conformation being perfected in all its parts, and
a complete circulation of the blood induced, the mother quickens. The foetus now
affumes a more upright figure, which correfponds with the fhape of the uterus. Its
head is found more elevated, its lower extremities are more diftended, its knees are
drawn upwards, with its arms refting upon them. It now meafures from feven to
eight inches in length, and is defcribed in the firft figure of the second lubjoined Plate.
Towards the end of the fixth month, the foetus begins to vary its pofition in the
womb, and will frequently be found to incline either to the right or to the left fide
of the mother. It will bv this time be increaled to nine or ten inches ;
and its ufual

In the feventh month the child acquires ftrength an^l folidity ;
as may be demon-
ftrated by thofe painful throws and twitchings which its mother feels from time to
time ;
and it is now increaled to eleven or twelve inches.
In the eighth month it generally meafures from fourteen tofixteen inches ;
and in
the ninth month, or towards the end of its full time, it is increaled from eighteen to
twenty-two inches, or more ;
when the head, by becoming fpecifically heavier than
the other parts, is gradually impelled downwards, and, falling into the birth, brings

AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES, SIS
The nourifhment of tlie foetus during all this time is derived from the placenta,
which is originally formed out of that part of the ovum which is next the fundus
uteri. The remaining part of the ovum is covered by a membrane called fpongy cho-
rion ;
within which is another called true chorion, which includes a third, termed
amnios. This contains a liquor, or watery fluid, in which the foetus floats tiil the
time of its birth. Before the chiid acquires a diftinCh and regular form, it is called
embryo ; but from the time all its parts become vifible, it takes and retains the name
offoetus till its birth. During the progrefs of impregnation, the uterus fufifers con-
siderable changes ;
but, though it enlarges as the ovum increafes, yet, in regard to
its contents, it is never full ;
for, in early geftation, thefe are confined to the fun-
dus only : and, though the capacity of the womb increafes, yet it is not mechanically
ftretched, for the thicknefs of its tides do not diminifh; there is a proportional iu-
creafe of the quantity of fluids, and therefore pretty much the fame thicknefs re-
mains as before impregnation. The gravid uterus, or pregnant womb, is of differ-
ent fizes in different w'omen ;
and muft vary according to the bulk of the foetus and
involucra. The fituation will alfo vary according to the increafe of its contents,
and the pofition of the body. For the firft two or three months, the cavity of the
fundus is triangular, as before impregnation; but, as the uterus ftretches, it gra-
dually acquires a more rounded form. In general, the uterus never rifes direbtly
upwards, but inclines a little obliquely, moft commonly to the right fide: its po-
fition is never, however, fo oblique as to prove the l’ole caufe either of preventing or
retarding delivery ; its increafe of bulk does not feem to arrfe merely from diften-
fion, but to depend on the fame caufe and increafe as the extenfion of the fkin in a
growing child. This is proved from lome late inftances of extra-uterine foetufes,
where the uterus, though there were no contents, was nearly of the famefize, from
the additional quantity of nourifliment tranfmitted, as if the ovum had been contain-
ed within its cavity. The internal furface, which is generally pretty fmooth, ex-
cept where the placenta adheres, is lined with a tender efflorefcence of the uterus,
w hich, after delivery, appears as if torn, and is thrown off with the cleanfings.
This is the membrana decidua of Dr. Hunter; which he defcribes as a lamella from
the inner furface of the uterus ;
though Signor Scarpa, with more probability, con-
fiders it as being compoled of an infpiflated coagulable lymph.
Though the uterus, from the moment of conception, is gradually diftended, by
which conflderable changes are occafloned, it is very difficult to judge of pregnancy
from appearances in the early months. For the firft three months the os tineas feels
fmooth and even, and its orifice as fmall as in the virgin ftate. When any difference
$an be perceived, about the fourth oriifth month, from the defeent of the fundus

through the pelvis, the tubercle or projecting part of the os tineas will feem larger,
longer, and more expanded ;
but, after this period, it Ihortens, particularly at its
fore-parts and fides, and its orifice or labia begin to feparate, fo as to have its coni-
cal appearance deftroyed. The cervix, which in the early months is nearly fhut,
n<3w begins to ftretch and to be diftended to the os tincae ; but during the whole
terni of utero-gefiation, the mouth of the uterus is ftrongly cemented with a ropy
mucus, which lines it and the cervix, and begins to be difeharged on the approach
of labour. In the laft week, when the cervix uteri is completely diftended, the ute-
rine orifice begins to form an elliptical tube, inftead of a fiffure, or to affume the
appearance of a ring on a large globe ;
and often at this time, efpecially in pendu-
lous bellies, difappears entirely, fo as to be out of the reach of the finger in touch-
ing. Hence the os uteri is not in the direction of the axis of the womb, as has ge-
nerally been fuppofed.
About the fourth, or between the fourth and fifth, month, the fundus uteri begins
to rife above the pubes or brim of the pelvis, and its cervix to be diftended nearly
one-third. In the fifth month the belly fwells like a ball, with the Ikin tenfe, the
fundus about half way between the pubes and navel, and the neck one-half diftend-
ed. After the fixth month the greateft part of the cervix uteri dilates, fo as to make
almoft one cavity with the fundus. In the feventh month the fundus advances as
far as the umbilicus. In the eighth it reaches mid-way between the navel and fero-
biculus cordis ; and in the ninth to the fcrobiculus itfelf, the neck then being entire-
ly diftended, which, with the os tine®, become the weakeft part of the uterus.
Thus at full time the uterus occupies all the umbilical and hypogaltric regions* its
lhape is almoft pyriform, that is, more rounded above than below, and having a
ftrifiture on that part which is furrounded by the brim of the pelvis. The appen-
dages of the uterus fuffer very little change during pregnancy, except the ligamenta
lata, which diminilh in breadth as the uterus enlarges, and at full time are almoft
entirely obliterated.
The various difeafes incident to the uterine fyftem, and other morbid affections of
the abdominal vifeera, in weak and fickly females, will frequently excite the fymp-
toms, and affume the appearance, of real pregnancy. Complaints arifing from a
limple obftrufition are fometimes miftaken for thofe of breeding ;
when a tumor
about the region of the uterus is alfo formed, and gradually becomes more and
more bulky, the fymptoms it occafions are fo ftrongly marked, and the refemblance
to pregnancy fo very linking, that the ignorant patient is often deceived, and*even
the experienced phyfician impofed on.

- Other kinds of fpurious gravidity, lefs hazardous in their nature than any of the
preceding, are commonly known by the names of falfe conceptions and moles: the for-
mer of thefe is nothing more than the diflolution of the foetus in the early months ;
the
placenta is afterwards retained in the womb, and from the addition of coagula, or
in confequence of difeafe, is excluded in an indurated or enlarged ftate ;
when it re-
mains longer, and comes off in the form of a flefiiy or fcirrhous-like mafs, without
having any cavity in the centre, it is diftinguilhed by the name of mole. Mere coa-
gula of blood, retained in the uterus after delivery, or after immoderate floodings
at any period of life, and fqueezed, by the preflfure of the uterus, into a fibrous or
compaCt form, conftitute another fpecies of mole, that more frequently occurs than
any of the former. Thefe, though they may afiume the appearances of gravidity,
are generally, however, expelled fpontaneoufly, and are feldom followed with dan-
gerous confequences. But, when two or more of the ova defcend into the uterus,
attach themfelves fo near one another as to adhere in whole or in part, fo as to form
only one body, with membranes and water in common, this body will form a confu-
fed irregular mafs, which is called a monfter
;
and thus a monfter may be either de-
fective in its organic parts, or be fupplied with a fupernumerary let of parts derived
from another ovum. This proceeds from a defect or accident in nature, which it is
entirely beyond the power of medicine to rectify or prevent.
It would feem, however, from a due contemplation of the foregoing facts, from
the frame and ftructure of females, and from the ultimate end and purpofe of their
conformation, that almoft every malady refulting from a ftate of pregnancy, except
the laft; mentioned, may be in a great me dure prevented or removed. The natural
temperature of women differs in a very confiderable degree from that of men, inaf-
much as their blood and juices are determined to an oppofite and diftinCt purpofe
;
and hence it is that obftructions of the menfes, their excefs, or privation of the of-
fice intended them, conftitute thefe peculiar maladies which we term Difeafes of fFo-
men.
31

men. The natural temperature of the male, is hot and dry ; that of the female, cold
and moift. The action of tire procreative tinfifeure of man is solar, i. e. of the heat-
ing and quickening faculty ;
that of the woman is lunar, i. e. of a cool and vege-
tative quality. As the fun heats, and gives prolific energy to the fruits of the earth,
fo man fecundates and gives life to the prolific tincture of the woman. Thus the
male, as the microcofin, or epitome of the celeftial fyftem, poffeffes an inherent ii-
militude with the fun, which vivifies and quickens ;
and thus the female, polfefling
an inherent fimilitude with the moon, vegetates and brings forth the fruit of her
womb, and not only feels the influence and fympathy of that luminary in her month-
ly difcharges, but in all the travail and vicifiitudes of pregnancy. To the fame
fource likewife we trace the caule, and decide the question, Whether the fruit of
the womb be male or female ? for, if the male feed be predominant, heat will abound,
and the male foetus will be generated ;
but, if the cooling moifture of the woman
overcomes the mafculine heat in the male feed, a female is then produced. The
old and exploded notion of this caufe depending on the child’s falling to the right
or left fide of the mother, is too ablurd to weigh a moment on the mind of any rea-
fonable enquirer.
We difcover likewife that the male, being conftituted of the folar temperature,
is naturally fubjected to thole infirmities of body and mind which refult from the
elements of fire and air ;
while thofe of the female are of lunar tendency, arifing
from the elements of water and earth. Of thefe four elements our grols or material
part is formed, and by their due and proper commixture in the conftitution, or
circulating mafs, are life and health eftablifhed ;
whilft, on the contrary, by their
difcordant, defective, or predominant, pow er, difeafe and death are produced. Now
the male abounding in heat, and the female in moifture, is the reafon why many
diforders incident to man are alleviated by contaCt with the woman, as thofe of
the w'oman are by contact with the man. In the grand fcale of Nature, we find the
meridian heat and fcorching rays of the fun are qualified and corrected by the cool-
ing moifture and mild influence of the midnight moon ;
but, when either of thefe
are obftruCted in their effeCt, by the intervention of accidental caufes, by ftorms,
by tempefts, or unfeafonable blafts, we then endeavour to reprefs by art the evil
confequences that are likely to enfue. Juft fo in the human economy, the grand
purpofe and defign of medicine is to correCt and modify the difcordant elements in
the conftitution, and give that vigour and tone to the vital powers, which conftitute
the genuine principles of health and life.
From what has been fuggefted we might fafely infer, that the conftitution and tem-
perature of the female require a medicine of an oppofite adtion and tendency to
that
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 317
that adapted to the male, and which ought to be compounded of elements conge-
nial to the intentions of Nature, calculated to purge the uterus, to purify the femi-
nal fluid, and give ftimulus to the catamenia; which, if not putin motion by the
fundtions of nature, becomes dull and flagnant, and vitiates the whole circulating
mafs; whence thofe diforders, peculiarly incident to the moft amiable, as being the
moft virtuous, of women, are confeffedly derived; and for the cure and prevention
of which, a peculiar and diftindt remedy has long been wanting.
Thefe, and other confiderations, influenced by the known power of fecond
caufes, and their faculty of adting upon the mechanifm of the human frame, induced
me to attempt the chemical preparation of two fubtile Tindtures, conftituted of a
co-mixture of the pureft elements of which our blood is compofed, and adapted to
the particular temperature and conftitutions of the oppoflte fexes. That intended
for the ufe of Man I call the Solar Tincture, as being congenial to the femi-
nal fundtions and vital principles of his conftitution. That adapted to Woman I
call the Lunar Tincture, as being calculated to adt upon the menftrual and ve-
getative fluids, and as being compounded of thofe elements which make up the
frame and temperature of her body. The invention of thefe Tindtu res hath been
the refultof a long and laborious application to the ftudy of unveiled Nature—of
the properties of fire, air, earth, and water, in the propagation of animal and ve-
getable life, and in the compofition of medicine ;
in which, though thefe elements
form the Pabulum of the univerfe, yet the art of colledting, uniting, and aflimi-
lating them with the vital fluids, feems to be unknown among modern chemifts,
and has efcaped the obfervation of medical fcience. The fixidity of thefe Tinc-
tures at once eftablifhes their power and efficacy beyond all others ;
for they can ;
never be affedted by change of weather or climate, nor by heat or cold; nor will
they fuffer any diminution of their ftrength or virtue by remaining open, or un-
corked; a circumftance which cannot be affirmed of any other fluid at prefent
known, throughout the world.
I fhall now proceed to fhow the adtion of the LuNAaTindture on Female confti-
tutions ;
and as this medicine is only intended to remedy fuch complaints as parti-
cularly relate to pregnancy, and the menftrual difeharge, I fhall omit to notice any
other maladies, until I come to treat of the Solar Tindture; which, though elfen-
tially diredted to give tone and vigour to the conftitution of the male, is neverthelefs
equally efficacious to the female in removing all diforders of the blood and lymph,
that are alike common to valetudinarians of both fexes. No complaint in the female
habit, therefore, comes under our prefent enquiry, till at or neai the age of puberty.
Until this important period of the fex arrives, the Rules heretofore laid down in
the Medical Part of my new edition of Culpeper’s Family Phyfician, for the raa-

nagementand future health of young ladies, deferve a very clofeand ferious atten-
tion. The evident dillindtion between the male and female in their ftrudture and
defign, in their bodily flrength and vigour, and in the procreative fluids, demands
the utmoft attention from themfelves, and the tendered; care from the phyfician.
Nor can we too often or too earneftly caution parents and guardians again!! the
evils of that abfurd though fafhionable ftyle of bringing up young ladies, by confin-
ing them almoft entirely to their apartments, keeping them on poor low diet, and
ufing artificial means to make them fpare and delicate, which contributes more to
their prejudice than all the incidental difeafes to which they are otherwife Subjedt.
Thefe refinements in female education, befides deflroying their ruddy complexion,
(which is often the defign of it,
)
relaxes their folids, impoveriflies their blood,
weakens their minds, and diforders all the fundtions of their body, whereby they
are often rendered incapable of conception, and denied the felicity of becoming
mothers. On the contrary, it ought to be the ftudy, as it certainly is the duty, of
all that have girls under their care, to indulge them in every innocent diverfion, and
in every adtive exercife, that can give freedom to the limbs, or agility to the body;
all of which have a natural tendency to exhilarate their fpirits, to promote diges-
tion, to flimulate their blood and juices, and, at the proper age, to bring on a free
and eafy difcharge of the menflrual flux.
Though it is univerfally admitted, that this flux is abfolutely neceffary to nourifli
and Support the foetus, and that without it human generation cannot be carried on;
and that it is consequently and obvioufly peculiar to the female uterine Syftem; yet
is it curious to obferve the various abSurd and contradidlory opinions Some phyfi-
cians have laboured to eflablifh, merely, one would fuppofe, to bewilder the under-
llanding, aud Subjedt delicate females llill more to that erroneous or miSguided
treatment, in which their health, their life, and every earthly bleffing, are too
frequently involved.
Dr. Bohn, and Dr. Freind, infill that this flux is nothing more than a plenitude
of the common mafs of blood, which nature throw's off only for relief againft the
too abundant quantity. Dr. Freind fuppofes, that this plenitude arifes from a coa-
cervation in the blood-veffels of a Superfluity of aliment, which, he thinks, remains
over and above what is expended by the ordinary ways; and that w'omen have this
plethora, and not men, becaufe their bodies are more humid, and their veffels, es-
pecially the extremities of them, more tender, and their manner of living generally
more inadtive than that of men; and that theSe things, concurring, are the occafion
that women do not perSpire Sufficiently to carry off the Superfluous alimentary
parts, till they are accumulated in Such quantities as to diftend the veffels, and
force their w ay through the capillary arteries of the uterus. It is fuppofed to hap-
pen
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 319
pen to women more than to the females of other fpecies, which have the fame
parts, becaufe of the ereCt pofture of the former, and the vagina and other canals
being perpendicular to the horizon; fo that the preffure of the blood is directed to-
wards their orifices: whereas in brutes they are parallel to the horizon, and the
preffure is wholly on the Tides of thofe veffels. The difcharge, he thinks, happens
in this part rather than in any other, as being more favoured by the ftruCture of
the veffels; the arteries being very numerous, and the veins finuous and winding,
and therefore more apt to retard the impetus of the blood; and confequently, in a
plethoric cafe, to occafion the rupture of the extremities of the veffels, which may
laft, till, by a fufficient difcharge, the veffels are eafed of their overload. To this
he adds the confideration of the foft pulpous texture of the uterus, and the vaft
number of veins and arteries with which it is filled. Hence a healthy maid, being
arrived at her growth, begins to prepare more nutriment than is required for the
fupport of the body; which, as there is not to be any farther accretion, muff of
neceffity fill the veffels, and efpecially thofe of the uterus and breafts, they being
the leaft compreffed. Thefe will be dilated more than the others; whence, the
lateral vafcules evacuating their humour into the cavity of the uterus, it will be
filled and extended. Hence a pain, heat, and heavinefs, will be felt about the
loins, pubes, &c. and the veffels of the uterus, at the fame time, will be fo dilated
as to emit blood in the cavity of the uterus, and its mouth will be lubricated and
loofened, and blood iffue out. As the quantity of blood is diminifhed, the veffels
will be lefs preffed, and will contract themfelves clofer, fo as again to retain the
blood, and let pafs the groffer part of the ferum ;
till at length only the ufual ferum
paffes. Again, there are more humours prepared, which are more eafily lodged
in veffels once dilated; and hence the menfes go and return at various periods in
various perfons.
This hypothefis is judicioufly oppofed by Dr. Drake, who maintains, that there
is no fuch plenitude, or at leaft that it is not neceffary to menftruation; arguing,
that, if the menfes were owing to a plethora fo accumulated, the fymptoms would
arife gradually, and the heavinefs, ftiffnefs, and inactivity, neceffary fymptoms of a
plethora, would be felt long before the periods were completed, and women would
begin to be heavy and indifpofed foon after evacuation, and the fymptoms would
increafe daily; which is contrary to all experience, many women, who have them
regularly and eafily, having no warning, nor any other rule to prevent an indecent
furprife, than the meafure of the time; in which, fome that have flipped have been
put to confufion and fliifts no ways confiftent with the notice a plethoric body
would give. He adds, that even in thofe w ho are difficultly purged this w ay, the
fymptoms, though very vexatious and tedious, do not make fuch regular ap-
proaches
320 A KEY TO PHYSIC
proaches as a gradual accumulation neceffarily requires. If we confider what vio-
lent fymptoms come on in an hour, we fhall be extremely puzzled to find the
mighty acceffion of matter, which lliould, in an hour or a day’s time, make fuch
great alterations. According to the hypothecs, the laft hour contributed no more
than the firft; and of confequence, the alteration fhould not be greater in the one
than in the other, fetting afide the bare eruption.
There are others who give into the do61rine of fermentation, and maintain the
evacuation in thofe parts to be an effe<ft of an effervefcence or ebullition of the
blood. This opinion has been maintained by Dr. Charleton, and by Bale, De
Graaf, and Drake, the two firft of whom fuppofe a ferment peculiar to women,
which produces this flux, and affedts that part only, or at leaft principally. Dr.
Graaf, lefs particular in his notion, only fuppofes an effervefcence of the blood,
railed by fome ferment, without affigning how it a6ts, or what it is. The fudden
turgefcenceof the blood occafioned them all to think, that it arofefrom fomething
till then extraneous to the blood; and led them to the parts principally affedted to
feek for an imaginary ferment, which no anatomical enquiry could ever fliow, or
find any receptacle for, nor any reafoning neceffarily infer. Again, that heat which
frequently accompanies this turgefcence, led them to think the cafe more than a
plethora, and that there was fome extraordinary inteftine motion at that time.
Dr. Drake contends, that it is not only neceffary there fhould be a ferment, but a
receptacle alfo for this ferment; concluding, from the fuddevmefs and violence of
the fymptoms, that a great quantity muft be conveyed into the blood in a fhort time,
and confequently that it muft have been ready gathered in fome receptacle, w here,
while it was lodged, its adtion was reftrained. He pretends to afcertain the place
both of the one and the other, making the gall-bladder to be the receptacle, and the
bile the ferment. The liquor he thinks well adapted to raife a fermentation in the
blood, when difcharged into it in quantity; and, as it is contained in a receptacle
that does not admit of a continual iffue, it may be there referved, till in a certain
period of time the bladder becoming turgid and full, through the compreflion of
the incumbent vifcera, it emits the gall; which, by the w'ay of the ladteals infinu-
atingitfelf into the blood, may raife that effervefcence which occafions the aperture
of the uterine arteries. To confirm this, he alleges, that perfons of a bilious con-
ftitution have the menfes either more plentifully, or more frequently, than others ;
and that diftempers manifeftly bilious are attended with fymptoms refembling thofe
of women labouring under difficult menftruation. But, if this argument be admit-
ted, men would have the menfes as well as women. To this however he anfwers,
that men do not abound in bile fo much as w'omen, the pores of the former being
more open, and carrying off more of the ferous part of the blood, which is the
vehicle
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 321
vehicle of all the other humours, and confequently a greater part of each is dif-
charged through them than in women, wherein the fuperfluity muft either continue
to circulate with the blood, or be gathered into proper receptacles, which is the
cafe in the bile. The fame reafon he gives why menftruation Ihould not be in
brutes : the pores of thefe being manifeltly more open than thofe of women, as
appears from the quantity of hair which they bear, for the vegetation whereof a
large cavity, and a wider aperture of the glands, is necelfary, than where no fuch
thing is produced: yet there is fome difference between the males and females even
among thefe, fome of the latter having their menfes, fuch as the orang outang,*
&c. though not fo often, nor in the fame form and quantity, as women. But with-
out dwelling on thefe abftraft reafonings, the abfurdity of which will be obvious
to every perfon who turns to the foregoing fyftem of human impregnation, we need
only remark, that there are two critical periods in every woman’s life, that completely
dellroy their hypothefis. Thefe are, that at the age of fourteen or fifteen, the menfes
begin to flow; but fubfide at the age of forty or fifty. At their commencement, we
generally find the difficulty, and confequent difeafe, larife from their deficiency }
whereas, according to the foregoing doctrine, they would then always flow with
the greateft freedom. At the period when they fliould ceafe, they are apt to come
in fuch abundance as to bring on a flooding, which not only endangers, but too
frequently deftroys, life—a fatal confequence that could not poffibly happen,
were the above arguments true.
Of FEMININE, or LUNAR, DISEASES.
THAT the vegetative or procreative faculties of women are univerfally governed
by the lunations of the moon, their own experience, as well as the demonftrations
given in my Illustration of Astrology, indifputably prove. The firft lliow of
the catamenia, if it be natural, invariably comes with the new or full moon; or
fometimes, though very feldom, at the commencement of her firft or laft quarters;
and this effort of nature is juftly confidered as the fure fign of a procreating abi-
lity, and of complete puberty. Whenever this feafon arrives, whether early or
late, the conftitution of every female undergoes a confiderable change, and the
greateft care and attention are then necelfary, fince the future health and happi-
nefs of every woman depends, in a great meafure, upon her conduft at this period.
It is the duty of mothers, and of thofe who are intrufted with the education of
girls, to inftruft them early in the conduct and management of themfelves at this
critical moment. Falfe modefty, inattention, and ignorance of what is beneficial

or hurtful at this time, are the fources of many difeafes and misfortunes, which a
very little attention might now prevent. Nor is care lefs neceffary in the fubfe-
quent returns of this difcharge. Taking improper food, violent agitatious of the
mind, or catching cold, is otten fufficient to ruin the health, or to render the fe-
male for ever after incapable of procreation.
In order to efcape the chlorotis, and other fimilar difeafes incident to young
women at that period when the menfes commence, let them avoid indolence and
inactivity, andaccuflom themfelves to exercife in the open air as much as poflible.
The difcharge in the beginning is feldom fo inflantaneous as to furprife them un-
awares. The eruption is generally preceded by fymptoms that indicate its ap-
proach ;
fuch as a fenfeof heat, weight, and dull pain, in the loins; diflention and
hardnefs of the breafls, head-ach, lofs of appetite, latitude, palenefs of the coun-
tenance, and fometimes a flight degree of fever. When thefe fymptoms occur,
every thing fhould be carefully avoided which may obflrudt the difcharge, and all
gentle means ufed to promote it; as fitting frequently over the fleam of warm
water, drinking warm diluting liquors, See. When the menfes have begun to flow,
great care fhould be taken to avoid every thing that tends to obflru&them ; fuch
as fifh, and all kinds of food that are hard of digeflion, and cold acid liquors. Damps
are likewife hurtful at this period; as alfo anger, fear, grief, and other affeCtions
of the mind. From whatever caufe this flux is obflruCted, except in the flate of
pregnancy, proper means fhould beinflantly ufed to reflore it; and if exercife in
a dry, open, and rather cool, air, wholefome diet, generous liquors in a weak and
languid flate of the body, cheerful company, and amufement, fail, recourfe muff
be had to medicine. In all fuch cafes, blood-letting mufl be carefully avoided; but
let the patient take from 20 to 50 drops of the Lunar TinClure, in a wine-glafs of
warm water, or penny-royal tea, every morning before breakfafl, every day at
noon, and every night before going to bed, until the intention be anfwered, which
will ufually take place in three or four days, without the affiflance of any other
medicine whatever. But it fometimes happens in relaxed conflitutions, that the
menflrual difcharge, on its firll appearance, is vitiated, and over-abundant; the
confequence of which is, that the patient becomes w eak, the colour pale, the ap-
petite impaired, and the digeflion languid, fo that dropfy or confumption is likely
to enfue. Effectually to prevent thefe, let the patient be kept two or three days
in bed, with her head low, and obferve a flender diet, principally of white meats,
and her drink red-port negus. Every night and morning, for ten or twelve days,
let her take one table-fpoonful of the Solar TinClure, diluted in double the quantity
of decoftion of nettle-roots, or of the greater comfrey ;
and after the flux has
abated*

abated, and her health and ftrength feem to return, let her only take a table-fpoon-
ful of the Solar TinCture every other day at noon, in a glafs of cold fpring-water
;
which wonderfully contributes to reftoreadue confiftency to the circulating mafs,
promoter digeftion, and invigorates the fpirits. Before the cuftomary period re-
turns, die muft difcontinue the Solar Tincture; and, if there be the lead; appear-
ance of irregularity or obftruCtion, let her again take night and morning, for two
or three days, from 20 to 30 drops of the Lunar Tincture, in a glafs of penny-
royal tea, and lhe will quickly find a regular habit, and her health amazingly efta-
blifhed. In obftinate or neglected cafes, where the menfes have feceded, and,
after an irregular appearance, have turned wholly into the habit, both thefe Tinc-
tures fhould be ufed with a lefs fparing hand, particularly under circumflances in
any refpeCt fimilar to the following remarkable
CASE.
Being called to the aftiftance of a young lady of fifteen years of age, I was in-
formed her menfes had made an irregular appearance about five or fix times, com-
ing firft with the full and then with the new moon, and afterwards at the diftance
of two or three months apart, until they totally difappeared, and turned back upon
the habit. No notice was taken, until the patient was feized wdth a violent bleed-
ing at the nofe, attended with fever, and epileptic fits. After being under the care
of an eminent phyfician for feveral months, who direCted venefe&ion, and almofi:
every cuftomary application, to no kind of purpofe, the diforder fixed in her neck,
forming a large tumour, the acrimony of w'hich fell upon her lungs, and threw her
into ftrong convulfions. In this extremity I wr
as fent for. Perceiving the whole
fyftem deranged by fpafmodic affections, and a locked jaw almofi: finally completed,
my firft objeCt u'as to relieve the vital organs, by giving force and elafiicity to the
circulating mafs. With this view, I with difficulty forced open the mouth, and ad-
miniftered one table-fpoonful of the Solar TinCture undiluted
;
and within half
an hour, to the aftonilliment of her friends, I had the pleafure of feeing every
convullive fymptom die away, and of hearing the patient’s voice, of which the had
been totally deprived for upwards of a week before. Two hours after, another
fpoonful of the Solar TinCture was taken with additional fuccefs; and the patient
afterwards continued this medicine in the quantity of a table-fpoonful, in a wine-
glafs of warm water, three times a-day, for fix days, at the expiration of w'hich time
her appetite and ftrength w'ere furprifingly returned; and the was then put under
a regular courfe of the Lunar TinCture. Twenty drops in a wine-glafs of penny-
royal tea were taken every night and morning for thirteen fucceftive days, and on
the morning following, it being the full moon, with which her menfes originally came,

fhe had the confolation to find that every obftru&ion was removed, and that the
due courfe of nature was completely re-eftabl idled. The glandular dwellings gra-
dually fubfided, her natural complexion quickly returned, and the now continues
in blooming health, perfectly regular, free from all obftrudtions, and from every
confequent complaint, thankful for the bleffings of her recovery, and defirous of
communicating the means to any unfortunate female under fimilar afflidtion; and
to whom reference may at any time be had, by application to the author.
CHLOROSIS, or GREEN-SICKNESS; by fome called the Love-Fever.
THIS dideade udually attacks virgins a little after the time of puberty, and firlt
fhows itdelf by fymptoms of dyfpepjia, or bad digeftion. But a diftinguifliing fymp-
tom is, that the appetite is entirely vitiated, and the patient will eat lime, chalk,
afhes, fait, &c. very greedily; while at the dame time there is not only a total in-
appetence to proper food, but it will even excite naufea and vomiting. In the be-
ginning of the difeafe, the urine is pale, and afterwards turbid; the face becomes
pale, and then affumes a greenifh colour; fometimes it becomes livid or yellow;
the eyes .are funk, and have a livid circle round them ;
the lips lode their fine red co-
lour; the pulfe is quick, weak, and low, though the heat is little fhortof a fever,
but the veins are fcarcely filled; the feet are frequently cold, dwell at night, and
the whole body deems covered with a foft dwelling; the breathing is difficult: nor
is the mind free from agitation as well as the body ;
it becomes irritated by the
flighteft caufes; and fometimes the patient loves folitude, and becomes fad and’
melancholy. There is a retention of the menfes throughout the whole courfe of
the diforder; which eventually fixes on the vital organs, and death endues.
The above complaint indifputably arifes from Rifling or duppreffing the calls of
nature at this vernal feafon, or juvenile fpring of life, when the primary command
of God, “ i/tcreafe and multiply,” is moft fenfibly impreffed upon the whole hu-
man fabric. Every tube and veffel appertaining to the genital dyflem, being now
filled with fpermatic or procreative liquor, excites in the female a powerful, yet per-
haps involuntary, irritation of the parts, which ftrongly folicits the means of difcharg-
ing their load, that can only be done by venereal embraces. Thede, from prudential
reafons, being often neceffarily denied, the prolific tindlures feize upon the ftomach
and vifcera, pen back and vitiate the catamenia, choke and clog the perfpirative
veflels, whereby the venal, arterial, and nervous, fluids, become ftagnant; and a leu-
cophlegmatia,or w hite flabby dropfical tumour, pervades the whole body, and quick-
ly devotes the unhappy patient to the arms of death. Thus, I am forry to remark,
are thoufands of the moft delicate and lovely women plunged into eternity, in the

very bloffom of life, when female excellence is but budding forth, big with the
promifed fruit of delicioufnefs and joy! How much then does it become the duty
of parents and guardians, who have daughters or wards in fituations like thefe,
and where no very grofs objection can arife, to fuffer them to marry with the men
they love, or othervvife to provide fuitable matches for them; fince this w-illeffedt
the moft rational and moft natural cure, by removing the caufe of the complaint
altogether. If, however, matrimony be not then convenient, nor likely in a fhort
time to take place, recourfe muft forthwith be had to proper regimen, and medical
aid, otherwife delirium or confumption will quickly enfue. The bell method of
regimen is laid down in the medical part of my edition of Culpeper, page 217.
which, if well obferved, in addition to the following courfe, will generally perform
a cure. Take leaves of mugwort, briony, and penny -royal, of each a handful; in-
fufe them four days in two quarts of foft water, and then pour off the clear liquor
for ufe. Take a gill-glafs three parts full, with thirty drops of the Lunar Tindture
added to it, three times a-dav, viz. morning, noon, and night, till the decodtion be
all ufed. Then reduce the dofe to twenty drops of the Tincture in a wine-glafs of
cold lpring-water morning and evening, for .fifteen days; after which it may be
taken only once a-day, or every other day, until the patient find herfelf free from
every fymptom of the difeafe. For this malad}^ it is the only fpecific hitherto
known; it unclogs the fpermatic tubes; purges and cools the uterus and vagina;,
promotes the menllrual difcharge, cleanfes the urinary paffages, diffolves vifcid
humours in the blood, fharpens the appetite, ftimulates the nerves, and invigorates
the fpirits, which in all Itages of chlorofis are fo apt- to be depreffed. When this
diforder is not very obftinate, nor far advanced, let the patient take from twenty to
thirty drops of the Lunar Tindture, in a wine-glafs of cold fpring-water, for thirty
or forty days fucceffively, and it will perform a cure without the trouble of pre-
paring the decodtion. In this malady, 1 have lately had the happinefs of complet-
ing an elegant cure,, which I mention here, merely for the information of fuch un-
fortunate maids as may be languithing under the fame deplorable circumftances.
The following is a literal ftatement of the
CASE.
A young lady, turned of feventeen, had'been afflidled with chlorojis almoft three
years. In the early part of the malady, the conceived an unconquerable appetite
for wood-cinders, concreted mortar, tobacco-pipes, fealing-wax, &c. The courfes
appeared at different intervals of the difeafe, hut always irregularly, and more or
lefs in a vitiated ftate. About half a year preceding my attendance, this flux had
totally ceafed; but, upon the approach of every new moon, with which hermenfes

326 A KEY TO PHYSIC
originally came, ftie was afflidted with pains in the back and loins, heavinefs and
turgidity about the region of the womb, and other cuftomary fymptoms of the ca-
tamenia; yet not the fmalleft iliow could be brought to appear. A little before
this, the lady’s affedtions had been placed on a young man in the neighbourhood;
but whofe fituation in life was by no means on a fcale adapted to the views of her
father and family. The moment therefore this attachment was difcovered, the
lady was confined to her apartment, and not fuffered to take either exercife or
frefh air, but when it fuited for fome trufly attendant to accompany her. This con-
finement brought on a fettled melancholy, a green fallow complexion, dejedted
fpirits, univerfal laflitudc, and wafting of the flefli. The morbid ftate of her body
having thus undermined her conftitution, without attradling either her own or her
father’s obfervation, the diforder fell upon the vital organs, and with fo rapid a
progrefs, that within twenty-four hours ihe was feized with an ardent fever, at-
tended with lofs of appetite, delirium, and a total privation of fpeech. In this
ihocking ftate, flie had the alternate advice of three phyficians of the firft refpedla-
bility; but the diforder increaling, and putting on the moft dangerous fymptoms,
after having baffled their utmoft fkill, a confultation was had, and the miferable
patient was configned to the grave.
Under thefe deplorable circumftances, it was my lot to be called in ;
and, upon a
clofe examination of the patient, fcarcely any vifible figns of life remained. The
pulfe had nearly fubftded. The a&ion of the heart and lungs could fcarcely be dif-
cerned. The eyes were funk and fixed; yet retained an uncommon look of expref-
fion and fentiment. At this time the had a large blifter round her neck, another on
the pit of her ftomach; a third, very large, between her flioulders; a fourth on the
head; a fifth and fixth inftde the ankles and legs. Venefe&ion had been fo often
repeated, that fcarcely blood enough remained to fupport the heat and aftion of
the heart. In this exhaufted ftate, I only adminiftered three table-fpoonfuls of
the Solar Tincture, undiluted, at intervals of little more than an hour apart; and in
the fpace of four hours after, I had the heart-felt fatisfa&ion of feeing the energy
of the blood reftored; pulfation gradually refumed its a&ion, the lungs w'ere di-
lated; refpiration became free; and a profufe fweat, which the Tindlure induced,
fortunately opened the perlpiratory veftels; and the patient began to give evident
figns of eafe and fenfibility. Warm nourilhing food was afterwards taken in fmall
quantities ;
and I was enabled to remove the blilters, and perform the dreftings,
w'ithout pain or torture to the languid patient. The Solar Tindlure was now adini-
niftered every day for ten days, in the quantity of atable-fpoonful in a wine-glafs
of w'arm barley-wr
ater, three times in the. day, and once in the night, whenever
tvatchfulnefs came on. About the middle of the feventh day, fhe began to articulate,
though

though not a word had been uttered for upwards of fix weeks before; and on the
tenth day, her voice and bodily functions were fo far reftored, that I deemed it
fafe to give her an interval of fix days reft, without any medicine whatever. I had the
happinefs to find my expeditions completely anfwered; for nature, affifted by nou-
rifhing food, effected more than a proftifion of drugs ;
fo that in little more than
twenty days my patient was able to walk about her room, and to put herfelf under a
courfe of the Lunar Tindture. This fhe perfifted in, with nourifhing diet, feconded
by occafional but very gentle airings in the carriage, for near a month longer; when
on the approach of the enfuing new moon, to the unfpeakable joy of her friends,
the menftrual flux refumed its natural courfe: the comfort and relief of which
were fo vifible to the patient, that fhe in ecftacy exclaimed, “ Mybufferings are at
an end.” This lady has everfince continued to improve in health and fpirits in fo
furpriiing a degree, that looking back on her late miferable and reduced ftate of
body, forms a contraft fo great as almoft to exceed belief. Yet the lady and her wor-
thy parent are at all times ready to authenticate the fadfto any reputable enquirer,
or to the friends of any unfortunate female labouring under a fimilar afflidfion.
Of the FLUOR ALBUS, or WHITES.
THE fluor albus, female weaknefs, or whites, as it is commonly called, is adif-
eafe of the womb and its contiguous parts; from which a pale-coloured greenifli
or yellow fluid is difcharged, attended with lofs of ftrength, pain in the loins, bad
digeftion, and a wan fickly afpedt. The quantity, colour, and confiftence, of the
difcharge, chiefly depend upon the time of its duration, the patient’s habit of body,
and the nature of the caufe by which it was produced. Weakly women of lax folids,
who have had many children, and have long laboured under ill health, are of all the
moft fubjedt to this difagreeable difeafe; from which they unfortunately fuffer more
fevere penance than others, as the niceft fenfations are often connedted with fuch a
delicacy of bodily frame as fubjedls them to it. In Holland it is very frequent, and
in a manner peculiar to the place, from the dampnefs of its fituation; the furround-
ing air being fo overcharged with moifture, as to relax the body, flop perfpiration,
and throw it upon the bowels or womb; producing in the firft a diarrhoea or flux,
in the laft the fluor albus or female weaknefs. The difcharge often proceeds from
the velfels fubfervient to menftruation; becaufe in delicate habits, where thole
veffels are weak, and confequently remain too long uncontradled, the fluor albus
fometimes immediately follows the menfes, and goes off by degrees as they gradually
clofe. It alfo comes from the mucous glands of the womb, as is particularly evident
in very young females of eight or ten years old; in whom, though very rarely, it
has
328 A KEY TO PHYSIC
has been obferved, and where it muff then neceffarily have efcaped from tliofe
parts, as the uterine vcffets are not fufficiently enlarged for its paffage'at fo early
a period. Sometimes, as in women with child, it proceeds from the paliage to the
womb, and not from the woml> itfelf; which, during pregnancy, is clofely fealed
-up, fo that nothing can pafs from thence till the time of labour. The application
of thofe inffruments called peffaries, from the pain and irritation they occafion,
are alfo apt to bring on this difcharge. The fluor albus has been fuppofed to fup-
ply the want of the menfes; becaufe, where the firft prevails, the laft are generally
either irregular, or totally wanting: but it might more properly be faid, that the
prefence of the fluor albus, which is a preternatural evacuation, occafions the ab-
fence of that which is natural ;
as is evident from the return of the menfes after
the fluor albus has been cured. Indeed, when this difcharge appears about the
age of thirteen or fourteen, and returns once a-month, with fymptoms like thofe
of the menfes, then it may be deemed flridlly natural, and ought not to be flop-
ped. The fluor albus may be diftinguiflied into two kinds. The firft arifes from a
fimple weaknefs, or the relaxation of the folids; which may either be general,
where the whole bodily fyflem is enervated and unftrung; or partial, where the
womb only is affedled, in confequence of hard labour, frequent mifcarriages, a
iuppreffion or immoderate quantity of the menfes, or a fprain of the back or loins.
In the firft cafe, the difcharge, being generally mild, may be eafily taken aw;
ay. In
the fecond, it may proceed from a vitiated or impure blood, where the body from
jthence is loaded with grofs humours, which nature, for her own fecurity and re-
lief, thus endeavours to carry off. In fuch cafes, the difcharge is often of a red-
difh colour, like that from old ulcerous fores; being fometimes fo fharp, as to
excoriate the contiguous parts, and occafion a fmarting, and heat of urine. A
deep-feated darting pain, with a forcing down, attending fuch a difcharge, is a
very dangerous and alarming fign, and indicates an ulceration or cancerous flate
of the womb. This malignant flate of the difeafe, if of long continuance, is ex-
tremely difficult of cure; and difpofes the patient to barrennefs, a bearing down,
dropfy, or confumption. In fliort, as this is a malady of the mofl difagreeable
kind, which by long continuance or negledl becomes difficult of cure, and often
proves fatal, it were to be wifhed that w omen, on fuch occafions, would be more
attentive to their own fafety, by ufing all poffible means, in due time, to prevent
the diforder.
As w omen are fometimes connedled with thofe who do notconfcientioufly regard
their fafety, it is a circumflance of the utrnofl confequence to diftinguifh a frefh ve-
nereal infection from the fluor albus, or whites:- for, if the flrfl be miflaken for the
laft,

laft, and be either neglected or improperly treated, the w orft consequences may
arife. In addition therefore to what I have Hated in page 219 of the Medical
Part of my edition of Culpeper, the following Signs will ferve to inform the patient
whether there be occafion for her doubts or not. A frefli infedtion, called gonor-
rhoea, is malignant and inflammatory; the fluor albus moll commonly arifes from
relaxation and bodily weaknefs; and therefore the remedies proper in the firft dif-
order, would render the lafb more violent, by locking up and confining the infec-
tious matter. In the gonorrhoea, the difcharge chiefly proceeds from the parts
contiguous to the uninary paflfage, and continues whilft the menfes flow; but in the
fluor albus it is Supplied from the cavity of the womb and its paflage, and then the
menfes are Seldom regular. In the gonorrhoea, an itching, inflammation, and heat
of urine, are the forerunners of the difcharge; the orifice of the urinary palfage is
prominent, and the patient is affedted with a frequent irritation to make water. In
the fluor albus, pains in the loins, and lofs of ftrength, attend the difcharge; and,
if any inflammation or heat of urine follow, they happen in a lefs degree, and only
after a long continuance of the difcharge, which, becoming fharp and acrimonious,
excoriates the Surrounding parts. In the gonorrhoea, the diSeharge Suddenly ap-
pears without any evident cauSe; but in the fluor albus it comes on more flowly,
and is often produced by irregularities of the menfes, frequent abortion, Sprains, or
long-continued illnefs. In the gonorrhoea, the difcharge is greenifh or yellow, lefs
in quantity, and not attended with the fame fymptomsof weaknefs. In the fluor
albus, it is alfo often of the fame colour, efpecially in bad habits of body, and
after long continuance; but is ufually more offenfive, and redundant in quantity.
The whites often afflidt maids of a weakly conftitution, as well as married women
and widows; and indeed there are few of the Sex, efpecially fuch as are flckly, who
have not known it more or lefs. For whatever difeafe renders the blood poor,
foul, or vifcous, and reduces a woman to a languid condition, is commonly fuc-
ceeded by the whites, which, when they come in this manner, continue to weaken
the body more and more, and are in great danger, without fpeedy remedy, of
wearing aw'ay the patient, and making her a miferable vidtim to death. Let no
woman, therefore, negledt this diforder, when fihe finds it on her, but endeavour to
obtain an immediate cure. The regimen and general management are pointed out
in the Medical Part of the work juft referred to, p. 220; and, in lieu of all other
medicines, make a decodtion of tcrmentil-root, biftort, comfrey, and red-rofe
leaves ;
take a gill-glafs three parts full, and add to it thirty or forty drops of the
Lunar Tindture, which muft be perfifted in morning, noon, and night, for ten days;
then take it morning and evening only for ten days more ; after which difcontinue

the decodtion, and take the Tindture every morning for a month, twenty drops in- a.
wine-glafs of cold fpring- water, the difeafe will be found gradually to abate; and,
upon any fymptoms of a return of it, take from fifteen to twenty drops of the
Tindture in a wine-glafs of cold water every morning for a week, and it will go
entirely off; as bath been verified in a great number of patients, who are ready to
tefiify that they owe their cure, even in the molt obftinate cafes, entirely to the
Lunar Tindture.
. I • •
Of BARRENNESS, or INFERTILITY.
BARRENNESS is fuch a ftate of a woman’s body, as indifpofes it, upon the
ufe of the natural means, to conceive and propagate her fpecies. This proceeds
from many fources, which may be reduced to thefe two general heads: Firft, An
indifpofition of the parts to receive the male femen in the adtof copulation, or that
vital effluvium ftreaming from it, which alone can impregnate the ovaria. Se-
condly, An inaptitude in the blood to retain and nourifh the vital principle after
it is communicated, fo as to make it grow and expand its parts, till it becomes a
proper foetus. Conception is alfo hindered by a hedtic, hydropic, or feverifh,
fickly habit; by a deficiency or obftruction of the monthly courfes, which impo-
verifhes the fluids; by the whites, which, continuing too long, relax the glands of
the womb, and drown, as it were, the prolific particles; and too often by a vice
which utterly deftroys the tone and vigour of the parts; as is fully exemplified in
the Medical Part of my Culpeper, p. 221.
Preparatory to the cure of infertility, it is proper to ufe evacuations, uniefs any
particular fymptom fhows them to be dangerous. Bleeding, lenient purgatives,
fuch as the folutive eledtuary, and a gentle vomit of ipecacuanha, efpecially if the
perfon be plethoric or cacochymic, cannot but be of great fervice; then proceed
with the following {Lengthening eledtuary: Take roots of fatyriou and eringo can-
died, of each one ounce; powders ot cinnamon, fweet fennel feeds, and preferved
ginger, of each half an ounce; mace, roots of contrayerva, and Spanifh angelica,
of each one dram; troches of vipers, one ounce; juice of kermes, fix drams;
tindture of cantharides, half a dram; fyrup of cloves, a fuflicient quantity to make
an eledtuary. Let the quantity of a large nutmeg be taken every morning early,
about five o’clock every afternoon, and at night going to bed; and, immediately
after taking the eledtuary, drink a wine-glafs full of the following infufion, adding
to it from twenty to thirty drops of the Lunar Tindture, viz. Take cinnamon pow-
dered, one ounce; of fweet fennel-feeds bruifed, and lavender-flowers, of each
half an ounce; Spanish angelica root, ginger, contrayerva, mace, and cochineal,
"'

of each one dram and a half; canary wine, two quarts : infufe according to art for
two or three days, and {train off the infufion for ufe. Continue the electuary for
ten days fucceffively ;
then omit a week, and continue it for ten days more; after
which continue the infufion and Tindture only, three times a-day, for ten days
more : then take it only twice a-day for a month, or as long as the cafe requires,
adding from fifteen to thirty drops of the Tincture to each glafs, as the age or con-
ftitution of the patient may require. This courfe will be found moft excellent for
barrennefs and debility; particularly while thus affiited by the Lunar Tindture;
which will greatly warm and redtify the blood and juices, increafe the animal Spi-
rits, invigorate and revive the whole human machine, and not only raife the appe-
tite to venereal embraces, but remove the ufual impediments to fertility; prepare
the womb for performing its office, and the ova tor impregnation. The Tindture
warms, comforts, and excites, the generative parts to admiration, and feldom fails
of curing all common occafions of barrennefs in a month or fix weeks, if duly fol-
lowed ;
as a proof of which I beg leave to add the pleafing circumftances of the
following finguiar
CASE.
A young lady of rank and fortune, but of a delicate frame, entered into the
marriage ftate about four years ago. Inftead of deriving from it that blifsful gra-
tification which gives the honoured name of Mother, fhe became weak, languid,
pale, and melancholy. The whole nervous fyftem was relaxed — the natural func-
tions of the body were fufpended—cedematous tumours obftrudled the fanguife-
rous paflages, whence incurable barrennefs and lingering confumption were the
fad profpedts left in view. In this melancholy ftate of body and mind, by advice
of her phyfician, when all hopes were at an end, lhe was put under a regular courfe
of the Lunar Tincture; which, to the aftonifhment of all, gradually deterged
the obftrudled vefiels—propelled the animal juices through the fyftem—ftrength-
ened and braced the nerves—induced a regular habit—reftored the fparkling eye
and rofy cheek, and gave new vigour to the animal functions—the refult of which,
has been, that before the end of the enfuing year, after her health was thus reco-
vered, the lady became the happy mother of a SON and HEIR, to the inexprefc
fible joy of an affedlionate hufband and a fympathifing family
!

INDISPOSITIONS attendant on PREGNANCY.
THOUGH pregnancy is not a difeafe, but rather a natural alteration of the ani-
mal oeconomy, which every female is formed to undergo, yet it is attended with a
variety of complaints which require great attention; but for the cure or alleviation
of w hich, medical aid has proved very deficient. In thefe complaints, however,
the Lunar Tindture exerts mofl extraordinary properties, and excels whatever has
been heretofore offered under a medical form. It is an univerfal purifier of thofe
heterogeneous particles which produce naufea, and arife from the combining ef-
forts of the mafculine and feminine tindtures ;
from whence, according to the
groffnefs of the procreative effences at the time of conception, proceed vomiting,
pains in the head and flomach, fainting, &c. occafioned by the jarring elements
arifing from the difproportion in the heat and adtive principle of the conflituent
parts of the male and female feed; which is not only attended with great debility
and depreffion to the mother, in her whole nervous fyftem, but often with heredi-
tary difeafes, and dreadful confequences to the infant offspring. Indeed fo great
has been the conflidt of the male and female procreative tindtures for the maftery
or predominant power, while paffing through the circulating mafs or habit of the
mother, that the mofl curious and aftonifhing phenomena have, on many occa-
fions, been obferved to refult from it. —In a fmall village in Somerfetfliire, in the
year 1 759, a girl w-as born w ith the hair on her head of twm remarkably diflindt co-
lours: the right fide, from an exadt parallel line which divided the fkull into two
equal parts, was almoft black; but the left fide, from the fame line, was of ared-
difh yellow. As fhe grew up, the dark hair became of a jet black, exadtly like
that of her father; whilfl the other became of a ftrong carrotty red, precifely re-
fembling that of her mother; and, after the age of puberty, the hair on the privi-
ties, an . under the arm pits, as well as on the arms and legs, was diverfified in the
fame manner; that on the right fide, all the way down from head to foot, being
black; whilfl that on the left was entirely red. The young woman lived till the
28th year of her age, and was reforted to as a great curiofity.
Another well known yet remarkable inflance of this conflidl of the male and fe-
male procreative tindtures at the time of impregnation, was the cafe of a man
who a few years fince kept a public-houfe in Tooley-flreet, Southwark. His fa-
ther was a white man, belonging to one of the Weft-India packets; and his mother
was a negro girl, whom he had taken a fancy to, and purchafed on the arrival of
one of the Guinea flave-lhips at the illand of Jamaica. He brought her with him
to
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 335
to London, and in the courfe of the enfuing year the was delivered of a fon, the
whole right fide of which was white like the father ;
but the whole of the left fide
was black like the mother. As he grew up, this vifible diftindtion became more
ftrongly marked; and, during the time he kept the above public-houfe in Tooley-
ftreet, he was reforted to by an iinmenfe concourfe of people, who flocked thereto
fpend their mite, in order to be fatisfied thatfo great a curiofity really exifled. The
whole of his body appeared to be interfered by an exadt parallel line, by which
the efforts of conception feem to have united the male and female tindlures in.
precife equilibrio, without fuffering them to intermix in coagula, or in impreg-
nating and expelling the ovum from the ovaria, to its fulpended ftate in the
uterus. Hence the hair on the right fide was long and brown, like that of the.
father; and half the face, neck, body, and privities, with the arm, thigh, leg, and
foot, on the right fide, were white ;
while the correfponding parts on the left fide
were black, like the mother, with half the hair on the privities and head black
and woolly, exadlly like that of a true negro.
A ftill more curious and ftriking example of this aftonifhing effort in the male and.
female procreative fluids, is verified in the cafe of Mr. John Clark, of Prefcot-
ftreet, Goodman’s-fields. His father was a native of Africa, who by dint of good
fortune had amaffed a confiderable fum of money, and fettled in London.. He
married a remarkably healthy white woman, a native of Devonfhire, who had been i
fome time his fervant. By her he had two fons and three daughters, who were mu-
lattos, except the eldefl fon, who was the firft born, and the perfon here alluded
to.. From the head to the navel, all round his body, he was remarkably fair
s
had a fine fkin, hand fome round features, light-brown hair, and fanguine complex-
ion, like his mother ;
but from the navel downwards he was completely black, with
fhort black woolly hair on the privities, exadtly like the father; At the age of
thirty he married a young lady of good family and fortune, but of a delicate difpo-
fition. For near three months he had theaddrefs to conceal this deformity of colour
from the knpwledge of his wife, by wearing flefhncoloured filk drawers and flock-
ings, which he pretended were lined with flannel to keep off the rheumatifm, with:
which he had been forely afffidted, even to a degree that endangered his life, .every
time he attempted to leave them off. It happened, however, from fome negleftof
concealment before going to fleep, that the curiofity of his wife w'as ftrongly excit-
ed; and the opportunity proving favourable in other refpedls, it being quite, day-
-
light in the morning, and her hufband fall afleep, fhe eagerly proceeded to fatisfy
her doubts. Gently turning, down the bed-elothes, and removing the other impe-
diments in the way of a complete infpe&ion, fbte no fooner difeovered the. real

334 A KEY TO PHYSIC
Hate of things, than the fhrieked out vehemently, and fainted away ! The huf-
band, thus fuddenly awakened, beheld his wife in a fit, and faw with forrow and re-
gret the confequences of a difeovery which refulted from his own negleCt. He
immediately arofe, called up the fervants, and procured medical afiiftance with
all convenient fpeed ;
but in vain —tbefudden furprife, added to the mortification
and terror of mind, had fo powerful an effeCt, that the lady died in convulfions,
nearly two months gone with child. I have often lamented that fortune did not
throw mein the way at this critical juncture, for two reafons : in the fir ft place, I
have the vanity to think I could have faved the patient’s life ;
but, had I failed,
in the fecond, I would have perfuaded Mr. Clark, from motives of philofophical
fpeculation, and for the improvement of medical fcience, to have fuffered me to
open the womb of this unfortunate lady, in order to extraCt the foetus ;
which, under
thecircurnftances of thisuncommon conformation of the father, might have enabled
me to throw a new light on this very curious fubjeCt of occult enquiry, perhaps
fo as to have accounted, more obvioutly, for the jarring conflicts and ftruggling
efforts of the mafculine and feminine tinCtures ;
to which alone we are to look to
for the formation of hermaphrodites, the production of monfters, &c.
Sympathy and antipathy moft certainly operate very powerfully on females in the
early ftate of pregnancy, and might, as was then fuggefted, have had a principal
fhare in carrying off the above unhappy patient, while no means were ufed to coun-
teract their influence on the mafs of blood. Sudden frights, longing and loathing,
and all marks on the foetus, are obvioufly derived from this caufe, and can only be
corrected by giving energy and ftimulus to the circulating fyftem, whereby the func-
tions both of mind and body are ftrengthened, and the nervous fluid fortified and
protected againft the fudden impreffion of external objeCts. It feems to be admit-
ted by many eminent practitioners, that the difeafes incident to a pregnant ftate in
the early months, arife from fympathy ;
whilft thofe peculiar to the more advanced
ftages of geftation, are produced by the ftretching and preffure of the uterus on
the contiguous vifeera . Thu heart-burn and diarrhoea, tenfion and pains of the
breaft, naufeaand head-ach, defire of unnatural food, tremors, and dejeCted fpirits,
fainting and hyfteric fits, premature menftruation, and confequent abortion, proceed
from the firft of thefe caufes; while coftivenefs, ftrangury, cramp, and cholic, ap-
pear to refult from the other. And, though the celebrated Dr. Stahl, Dr. Cullen,
and others, have fo much differed as to the theory of thefe difeafes, yet they all agree
that gentle opiates, aromatic infufions, ftrengthening bitters, and medicines calcu-
lated to give energy to the languid ftate of the circulation, and to purify the grofs
and vifeid elements which opprefs the ftomach and vifeera, are the only proper re-
medies
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 335
medies to be adminiftered. Now the Lunar TinCture poffeffes the aromatic and
aftringent virtues in an admirable degree; and is elegantly adapted to invigorate
and aftift the aCtive faculties of nature, in expelling all vifcid humours from the fto-
mach and bowels ;
and, being compounded of the moft fubtle and occult elements,
which preferve the vital principle, it hence produces the moft falutary effects on
all women in a ftate of pregnancy, by ftimulating the procreative faculty to the for-
mation of the fineft children ;
correcting and purifying the procreative fluid from
infection or difeafe ;
preventing moles or falfe conceptions, removing all loathings,
longings, or vomiting, and effectually preventing abortion, from any caufe what-
ever. —For thefe reafons, when a woman enters into the ftate of matrimony, fhe
would do well to take twenty drops of the Lunar TinCture every other morning, to
promote conception ;
fhe fhould then continue it three times a-week, from concep-
tion to the end of the fourth month ;
then it may be omitted till a fortnight before
her time, when fhe fhould take twenty drops in a wine-glafs of cold fpring water
every morning till her labour, at which time it will wonderfully ftrengthen her, affift
her throws, facilitate the birth, promote the lochia, and carry off the after-pains. She
might take it occafionally during the month, in any fymptoms of cold, fever, or
hyfterics, diluted in a wine-glafs of warm barley-water, about the middle of the day.
Women who are fubjeCt to mifcarriages, fhould never fail to take this medicine,
from the time they have reafon to believe they are pregnant, until a full month after
they have quickened. It may be taken once, twice, or thrice, a day, or every other
day, as the urgency of the cafe may require, from twenty to thirty drops, in a glafs
of forge-water, or in foft fpring-water in which common oak-bark has been fteeped
;
and fhe will effectually get over all caufes of abortion. Women after fudden mif-
carriages, or bad labours, will find wonderful relief by taking twenty drops of it
in a wine-glafs of warm barley-water, for a week or ten days. Nurfes, alfo, whofe
milk is griping, or defective, fhould take it once or twice a-day, or as often as
occafion may require. The intention will quickly be experienced, the milk will
be purified and augmented, and all the fluid fecretions promoted in a manner pro-
ductive of found health, both to the mother and child. —In cafes where cedematous
fwellings of the legs and labia are occafioned by the interruption of the refluent
blood from the preffure of the diftended uterus on the vena cava—in violent flood-
ings—in nervous fpafms—in epileptic fits, and in obftinate convulftons, where
the vis vitce muft be fupported by replenifhing the veffels with the utmoft fpeed
—recourfe fhould be had to the Solar TinCture, which in the moft dangerous
cafes has been found to give immediate relief; and, if duly perfifted in, according
to the bill of directions, will fcarcely ever fail to effeCt a cure.

STATE of WOMEN at the TURN of LIFE.
THE moll critical and dangerous time of a woman’s life is that wherein the men-
fes ceafe to flow, which ufually happens between forty and fifty years of age. The
great change that this produces, by fo copious a drain being returned into the habit,
without previous preparation, is the foie caufe of its danger. Every woman muft be
more or lefs fenfiblewhen this period arrives, and Ihould condudl herfelf according-,
ly ;
for, when the menfes are about to go off, they appear for the njofl part irregu-
larly, both in time and quantity; once in a fortnight, three, five, or fix, weeks;;
fometimes very fparingly, and other times in immoderate quantities. For wantonly
of neceflfary care and attention, during the time that the menfes thus give fymptoms
of their departure, many and various are the complaints that enfue ;
among!! which
are cold chills, fucceeded by violent ftufhings of the face, and heats of the extremi-
ties; reftlefs nights, troublefome dreams, and unequal fpirits; inflammations of. the
bowels ;
fpafmodic affedtions; ftiffnefs in the limbs, fwelled ankles, fore legs, with
pains and inflammation ;
the piles, and other fymptoms of plenitude. But all this
might eafily be prevented, by attending to a due regimen, and taking thefe Tinc-
tures as occafion may require. Whenever a woman has reafon to fufpect her men-
fes are about to leave her, let her lofe" four, five, or fix, ouncesof blood, as her habit
of body will admit ;
then let her make a deco6lion, by taking gentian-roots, one
pound; fenna and orange-peel, of each half a pound ;
pour upon them a gal-
lon of hot water, and, after it has Rood twenty-four hours, pour off the liquor for-
ufe. Let her take from twenty to forty drops of the Lunar Tin6ture in a gill-glafs
of the above decoction, every night and morning for ten days ;
then let her con-
tinue it every morning for ten days more, and afterwards once every two or three
days, or oftener if the terms are of an ill colour and fcent, until they are corre&ed.
.
This courfe mull be followed every fpring and fall, fora month or fix weeks fuccef-
fively, by all women who find their menfes come irregularly, or too fparing, until
they entirely ceafe ;
after which let the patient put herfelf under a courfe of the Solar
Tindture for a month or fix weeks, taking one fpoonful in a wine-glafs of warm
water every night and morning for a week; then let it be taken only once a-day, in
cold water, for the refidue of the time ;
and, if Ihe takes occalionally two table-
fpoonfuls of the Solar Tin&ure, diluted in a tumbler of warm water, as a beverage
after dinner or fupper, inllead of wine or brandy and water, it will be produdtive
of great benefit in eftablifhing a healthful Hate of the blood, and carrying off the
vifcid humours generally produced by the menllrual flux returning into the habit.
Should
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 337
Should it at this time happen, which it often does, that the terms flow too abun-
dantly, and produce a flooding, the patient muft immediately lofe fix or eight ounces
of blood, and be kept as much as poffible at reft, with her head low, until the me-
dicine has had time to takeeffedl; let her diet be fpare, but not too lax; and
jet her apply to the following courfe : Take conferve of red robes, marmalade of
quinces, juice of kermes, candied nutmegs, fyrup of quinces, and fyrup of coral,
of each half an ounce; aromaticum rofalbum, and aftringent faffron of iron, of
each two drams ;
oil of cinnamon, fix drops: mix into an electuary, (which might
be made up by any apothecary, if the receipt be fent him ;) and take the quantity
of a large nutmeg every day at noon for fix, eight, or ten, days, or longer, as the
urgency of the cafe may require, drinking immediately after it twenty drops of the
Lunar Tindture in a wine-glafs of warm water; the flooding, by this means, will
gradually abate, the feverifli fymptoms will go off, the back will be ftreugthened,
the womb-veffels cleanfed, and the patient wonderfully reftared. After the tenth
day, in moft cafes, the eledluary might be difcontinued ;
and the Lunar Tindlure
fhould then be taken every morning for a month, from fifteen to twenty drops, ac-
cording to the conftitution of the patient ; by which time the parts will be braced,
comforted, and coiled up ;
fo as to fear no danger of a relapfe. About a month
after, let her undergo a courfe of the Solar Tindlure, for the purpofe of redtifying
and iUmulating the mafs of blood ;
this ftiould be taken for a month ; a table-
fpoonful night and morning in a wine-glafs of cold fpring-water for the firft ten
days ;
and then once a-day only for the refidue of the time ; the good effedis of
which will be fenfibly and quickly felt.
The intention of nature in returning this flux back into the habit, is to nouriftt
and preferve life, not to deftroy it. Until the age of puberty, girls require this
blood for the fuftentation and nouriihment of their bodies ;
when that is sufficiently
eftablilhed, it is applied to the purpofes of nouriffiing the foetus, and of buckling
the infant after it is born. When child-bearing ceafes, and the eve of life comes
on, the flux is returned back, to comfort and preferve it ; therefore, if women were
but careful to obferve a regular courfe before this flux returns upon them, by
adopting the methods I have prefcribed, a.n^ by taking the medicine fpring and
fall for two or three years previous to the time, they might not only efcape the
perils and dangers attendant on this period, but would lay the foundation of a
fettled ftate of health, and enjoy a found conftitution of body to extreme old age.

338 A KEY TO PHYSIC
Of MASCULINE, or SOLAR, DISEASES.
SOLAR difeafes are all fuch as proceed from a hot and dry caufe, and have
their origin in the blood and lymph. For, as the beams flowing from the fdn are
the fountain of life and heat to the great world, or univerfal fyftetn of nature, fo
the blood, flowing from the heart, is the fountain of life and heat to the little world,
or univerfal fyftem of the microcofm, or body of man. And again, as the ftream
of rays from the fun regulates the feafons, and produces the variety of climates,
fo the ftream of blood in man’s body, as affedted by the fun, regulates and diver-
fifies the form and figure of the whole race of human beings. As feafons and cli-
mates are fubjedt to the external elements, which are (till governed by the fuperior
influence of the fun, fo they are rendered either mild, healthful, and produdtive, or
turbulent, peftilential, and barren. Juft fo the whole circulating mafs is affedted
by change of climates and feafons, and by all the variations and agitations of the
external elements ;
and hence difeafes are induced in the blood, and are either
mild, ardent, or acute, in proportion as the fanguiferous fluid becomes diftempered
and impaired by the adlion of the ambient, or contiguous atmofphere. Thus we
perceive the folar influence on the human frame, and difcover that the origin of
difeafe is in the blood ;
for, no longer than this vital ftream is kept in due cir-
culation, pure and uncontaminated, can animal life be fuftained, or the body pre-
ferved in health and vigour.
From the exprefs words of Scripture, Levit. xvii. 11, 14. Deut. xii. 23. we are
warranted to infer, that “ in the BLOOD is the LIFE;” and there is not a doubt
but the living principle of the blood conftitutes the life of the body. Of this opi-
nion was the celebrated Hervey, as well as many of the ancient philofophers and
phyficians ;
and the late Mr. John Hunter declared himfelf to be of the fame way
of thinking. We find the blood unites living parts, in fome circumftances, as
certainly as the yet-recent juices of the branch of one tree unite it with that of
another. Were either of thefe fluids to be confidered as extraneous or dead mat-
ters, they would adt as ftimuli, and ~rvo union would take place in the animal or
vegetable kingdoms. This argument Mr. Hunter eftablifhed by the following ex-
periment. Having taken off the tefticle from a living cock, he introduced it into
the belly of a living hen. Many weeks afterwards, upon injecting the liver of
the hen, he injected in the tefticle of the cock likewife, which had come in contaft
with the liver, and adhered to it. In the nature of things there is not a more inti-
mate connexion between life and a l'olid than between life and a fluid. For, although
we are more accuftomed to conned! it with the one than the other, yet the only real
difference
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 3 39
difference which can be fhown between a folid and a fluid is, that the particles of
the one are lefs moveable among themfelves than tbofe of the other. Befides, we
often fee the fame body fluid in one cafe and folid in another. The blood will
alfo become vafcular like other living parts. Mr. Hunter affirms, that, after am-
putations, the coagula in the extremities of arteries form velfels, and may be injected
by injecting thefe arteries; and he had a preparation by which he could demon-
ftrate veffels rifing from the centre of what had been only a coagulum of blood, and
opening into aftream of circulating blood. If blood be taken from the arm in the
moft intenfe cold which the human body can bear, it raifes the thermometer to the
fame height as blood taken in the moft fultry heat. This is a ftrong proof of the
blood’s being alive; for living bodies alone have the power of refilling great de-
grees both of heat and cold, and of maintaining in almoft every fituation, while in
health, that temperature which we diftinguilh by the name of animal heat. Blood
is like wife capable of being acted upon by a ftimulus ;
for it coagulates from expo-
fure, as certainly as the cavities of the abdomen and thorax inflame from the fame
caufe. The more it is alive, that is, the more the animal is in health, it coagulates
the fooner on expofure; and the more it has loft of its living principle, as in the
cafe of violent inflammations, the lefs is it fenfible to the ftimulus produced from
its being expofed, and it coagulates the later. We may likewife obferve, that the
blood preferves life in different parts of the body. Whep the nerves going to a
part are tied or cut, the part becomes paralytic, and lofes all power of motion ;
but
it does not mortify. If the artery be cut, the part dies, and mortification enfues.
What keeps it alive in the firft cafe? nothing but the living principle, which alone
can keep it alive; and this phenomenon is inexplicable on any other fuppofition
than that the life is contained in the blood. Another argument is drawn by Mr.
Hunter from a cafe of a fraftured os humeri. A man was brought into St. George’s
hofpital for a Ample fracture of the os humeri, or arm ;
and died about a month
after the accident. As the bones had not united, Mr. Hunter injedted the arm after
death. He found that the cavity between the extremities of the bones was filled
up with blood which had coagulated. This blood was become vafcular, or full of
veffels ;
in fome places it was very much fo. He does not maintain that all coagu-
lated blood becomes vafcular: and indeed the reafon is obvious; for it is often
thrown out and coagulated in parts where its becoming vafcular could anfwer no
end in the fyftem : as, for example, in the cavities of aneurifmal facs. If it be
fuppofed, that, in fuch cafes as that juft now mentioned, the veffels are not formed
in the coagulum, but come from the neighbouring arteries, it is equally an argument
that the blood is alive: for the fubftance into which veffels fhoot muft be fo. The
very
340 A KEY TO PHYSIC
very idea, that fuch a quantity of dead matter as the whole mat’s of blood circu-
lates in a living body, is abfolutely abfurd.
Thofe who have ventured to oppofe this doctrine, and the evidence of Scripture
with it, confider the brain and nervous fyftem as the fountain of life ;
and that, fo
far from receiving its life from the blood, the nervous fyftem is capable of inftanta-
neoufly changing the crafis of the blood, or any other animal fluid ;
and, though the
nervous fyftem cannot continue its afition for any length of time if the a6!ion of the
blood-veflels is fufpended, yet the heart and blood-veflels cannot a6t for a Angle
moment without the influence of the nervous fluid. For this reafon, fay they, it is
plain we muft fuppofe the nervous fyftem, and not the blood, to contain properly
the life of the animal, and confequently to be the principal vital organ. The fecre-
tion of the vital fluid from the blood by means of the brain, is, by the fupporters
of this argument, denied. They fay, ‘that any fluid fecreted from the blood muft
be aqueous, inelaftic, and inactive; whereas the nervous fluid is full of vigour, elaf-
tic, and volatile in the higheft degree. The great neceflity for the circulation of
the blood through all parts of the body, notvvithftanding the prefence of the nervous
fluid in the fame parts, they fay is, becaufe fome degree of tenfion is neceffary to
be given to the fibres, in order to fit them for the influx of the nervous fluid ;
and
this tenfion they receive from the repletion of the blood-veflels, which are every
where difperfed along with the nerves.
To follow this opinion through every argument, would prove tedious and un-
neceflary, as the following fliort obfervations will decide the matter abfolutely
again!! the patrons of the nervous fyftem. In the firft place, then, if we can prove
the life of the human body to have been communicated from a fluid to the nervous
fyftem, the analogical argument will be very ftrongly in favour of the fuppolition
that the cafe is fo ftill. Now that the cafe once was fo, is moft evident; for the
human body, as well as the body of every other living creature, in its firft ftate, I
have fliown to be a gelatinous mafs, without mufcles, nerves, or blood-veflels.
Neverthelefs this gelatinous matter, even at that time, contained the nervous fluid.
Of this there can be no doubt, becaufe the nerves are formed out of it, and have their
power originally from it; and what is remarkable, the brain is obferved to be that
part of the animal which is firft formed. Of this gelatinous or procreative fluid
we can give no further account, than it is the nutritious matter from which the
whole body appears to be formed. At the original formation of man and other ani-
mals, therefore, the nutritious matter was made the l’ubftratum of the whole body,
confiding of mufcles, nerves, blood-veflels, &c. nay more, it was the immediate
efficient caufe of the nervous power itfelf. Again, in the formation of the embryo,
we
34!
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES.
we fee a vital principle exifting as it were at large, and forming to itfelf a kind of
regulator to its own motions, or a habitation in which it choofes to r> fide, rather
than to a<5t at random in the fluid. This habitation, or regulator, is undoubtedly
the nervous fyltem; but at the fame time, it is no lefs evident that a nutritious fluid
is the immediate origin of thefe fame nerves, and of that very nervous fluid Now
we know, that the fluid which in the womb nouriflies the bodies ol all embryo ani-
mals, is neceffarily equivalent to the blood which nouriflies the bodies of adult
ones; and confequently, as foon as the blood became the only nutritious juice of
the body, at that fame time the nervous fluid took up its refidence there, and from
the blood diffufed itfelf along the nerves, where it was regulated exadtly according
to the model originally formed in the embryo. Perhaps it may be faid, that the vital
power, when once it hath taken pofleffion of the human or any other body, requires
no addition or fupply, but continues there in the fame quantity from firft to laft. If
we fuppofe the nervous power to be immaterial, this will indeed be the cafe, and
there is an end of reafoning upon the fubjedt; but, if we call this power a volatile
and elaftic fluid, it is plain that there will be more occafion for recruits to fuch a
power than to any other fluid of the body, as its volatility and elafticity will pro-
mote its efcapein great quantities through every pore of the body. It may perhaps
be objected, that it is abfurd to fuppofe the blood capable of putting matter in fuch.
a form as to diredt its own motions in a particular way : but even of this we have a
pofitive proof in the cafe of the eledtric fluid. For if any quantity of this matter
has a tendency to go from one place to another where it meets with difficulty,
through the air for inftance, ifwill throw fmall condudting fubftances before it, in-
order to facilitate its progrefs. Alfo, if a number of fmall and light condudting
fubftances are laid between two metallic bodies, fo as to form a circle, for example ;
a fliock of eledtricity will diftroy that circle, and place the fmall condudting fub-
ftances nearer to a ftraight line between the two metals, as if the fluid knew there was
a fhorter paffage, and refolved to take that, if it fhould have occafion to return.
Laftly, it is univerfally allowed, that the brain is a fecretory organ, made up of an
infinite number of fmall glands, which have no other excretories than the medul-
lary fibres and nerves. As aconfiderable quantity of blood is carried to the brain,
and the minute arteries end jn thefe fmall glands, it follows, that the nervous fluid
mujl comefrom the blood. Now, there is no gland whatever, in the human or
any other body, but will difcharge the fluid it is appointed to fecrete, in very confi
derable quantity, if its excretory is cut Upon the cutting of a nerve,, therefore,
the fluid fecreted by the brain ought to be difcharged ;
but no fuch difcharge is vifi-
ble. A fmall quantity of glairy matter is indeed difcharged from the large nervesj
.
No. 32. 4 S but.
342 A KEY TO PHYSIC
but this can be no other than the nutritious juice neceffary for their fupport. This
makes it plain, even to demonftration, that the fluid fecreted in the brain is invisi-
ble in its nature ;
and, as we know the nervous fluid hath its refidence in the brain,
it is very probable, to ufe no ftronger expreflion, that it is the peculiar province of
the brain to fecrete this fluid from the blood, and confequently that the blood origi-
naliy contains the vital principle.
This fa<5l being eftablifhed, I fhall now endeavour to defcribe the adtion of quick-
ening, or inode by which life is communicated to the child in the womb, which
ufually takes place in the fifth month of pregnancy Opportunities, however, of
differing the human gravid uterus at or near this critical jundlure occurring but
feldom, it is with great difficulty that a fubjedt of this delicate and abftrufe nature
can be treated with perfpicuity, and is the principal caufe why it has not been at-
tempted by former phyfiologifts. I have already fhown, that the rudiments of the
embryo puts forth four membranes, viz. the placenta, the navel-ftring, the chorion,
and amnios, which contains the fluid above-mentioned, in which the foetus floats.
Until the periodof quickening arrives, the embryo poffefles only vegetative life, fitni-
lar to that of a common plant ; and its growth is nourifhed and prefervec by the
fluid in which it fwims, until the nerves, veins, arteries, and vital organs, are en-
tirely formed, and the circulation of its mother’s blood is completed through them,
which is condu filed in the following manner.
The placenta is the medium by which the blood from the heart of the mother is
communicated to that of the child ;
but to check its too rapid progrefs, which would
overwhelm the tender veffels of the infant frame, the texture of the placenta is form-
ed fimilar to that of a fponge, round like a cake, of confiderable dimenfions, and
capable of great abforption, being chiefly made up of the ramifications of the um-
bilical arteries and vein, and partly of the extremities of the uterine veffels. The
arteries of the uterus difcharge their contents into the fubftance of this cake ; and
the veins of the placenta, receiving the blood either by a direfil communication of
veffels, or by abforption, at length form the umbilical vein, which paffes on to the
finus of the vena porta, and from thence to the vena cava, and heart of the infant,
by means of the canalis venofus, a communication that is clofed up in the adult.
But the circulation of the blood through the heart is not conduced in the foetus as
in the adult: in the latter, the blood is carried from the right auricle of the heart
through the pulmonary artery, and is returned to the left auricle by the pulmonary
vein ;
but a dilatation of the lungs is effential to the paffage of the blood through
the pulmonary veffels, and this dilatation cannot take place till after the child is
born, and has refpired. This deficiency is therefore fupplied in the foetus by an
immediate
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 343
immediate communication between the right and left auricle, through an oval open-
ing, in the feptum which divides the two auricles, called foramen ovale. The
blood in the foetus is likewife tranfmitted from the pulmonary artery to the aorta,
by means of a du6t called canalis arteriofus, which, like the c^nalis venofus and fo-
ramen ovale, gradually clofes after birth. The blood is returned again from the
foetus to the mother through two arteries called umbilical arteries, which arife from
the iliacs. Thefe two veffels, taking a winding courfe with the vein, form with that
and the membranes by which they are furrounded, what is called the umbilical
chord Thefe arteries, after ramifying through the fubftance of the placenta, dif-
charge their blood into the veins of the uterus, in the fame manner as the uterine
arteries difcharged their blood into the branches of the umbilical vein. So that, after
quickening, the blood of the mother is conftantlv palling in at one tide of the pla-
centa, afid out again at the other, for the nourifhment of the child.
Now what we call the adtion ofquickening, is thatinftantaneous, yetundefcribable,
motion of the vital principle, which, the inftant the foetus has acquired a fufficient
degree of animal heat, and is completely formed in all its parts, rulhes like an elec-
tric lhock, or flalh of lightning, conducted by the fanguiferous and nervous fluids,
from the heart and brain of the mother, to the heart and brain of the child. At
this moment the circulation begins ;
the infant fabric is completely fet in rnotiom
and the child becomes a living foul. As foon, therefore, as the circulation com-
mences, the child Harts into life; and the inftant the circulation ceafes, life ceafes alfo.
This aU of quickening is therefore derived from the blood ;
and is fo fenfibly felt by
the mother, that Ihe often faints, or feels an internal depreflion of her animal and
vital powers, which may be faid, in fome meafure, to have departed from her. But
the adt of quickening does not take place in all women at the fame period, nor al-
ways in the fame women at the fame diftance of time from her conception ;
nor is it
governed by any given number of weeks or days after conception has taken placo;
but depends entirely on that inftant of time, when the joint influence of animal
heat, and an entire Completion of the nerves, veins, arteries, and other parts and or-
gans, of the foetus, are fitted and ready to receive and fupport a due circulation of
the blood and juices; for this, and this alone, is the fource of quickening, and the
beginning of animal life. Strong and healthy women will therefore quicken fooner
than the weak and delicate, by reafon that their procreative and ftimulating pow-
ers are more robuft, and can fooner contribute that portion of animal heat which is
necefiary to the entire completion of the foetus in all its parts ;
and which will hap-
pen fooner or later, according to the health and ftrength of the pregnant woman,
and her fufliciency of menftrual blood to fupport the demand. For this flux will

now be wholly taken up by the new fubjedt, until the hour of birth; after which ft
either renews its monthly evacuation, as being redundant in the mother; or, if the-
fuckles the child, it is then determined to the mammae, and is converted into milk.
Such is this curious and moft admirable contrivance of nature, for the re-pro-
dudtion and propagation of mankind ; and fuch the nature and event of that myflse-
rious action of quickening, which has hitherto been involved in fo much darknefs
and obfcurity, as to lead the unthinking multitude to fuppofe, that giving life to the
foetus was in every inflance a new and diftindfc interpolation of the Deity, inflead of
religioufly imputing it to that primary exertion of his omnipotence, which, in the
original formation of Adam, implanted in his nature the power of re-producing his-
like, and of imparting life and foul to his fpecies, by a fixed and immutable decree,
to be continued down from father to fon, to the final end and confummation of this
fublunary world. If the feed of Adam had not been originally endued with the
gift of imparting life and fpirit to his future generations, how could the fouls of his
defcendants be fubjedfced to original fin? Were any one child defcended from the
race ofAdam to receive the gift of life and foul from a fubfequent exertion of the
power of God, it would become a new and diftindf adt of creation, and the offspring
could not poffibly be contaminated by the Fall, nor be fubjedfced to the miferies and
misfortunes refulting from it, as having received its being from an independent
caufe.
I have, to the belt of my ability, endeavoured to illuftrate this occult procefs of
Nature, by means of the annexed copper-plate engraving, taken from the vifcera
and womb of an afflidted female, who fainted and died at the time of quickening,
the foetus itfelf being now- preferved in fpirits. The ftrudfcure of the gravid uterus
is, however, extremely difficult to be fhown, and the more fo under thefe peculiar
circumftances. In the wombs of women who die after this period, or at the time
of labour, or foon after delivery, fibres running in various diredfcions are obferva-
ble more or lefs circular, that feem to arife from three diflindt origins, namely, from
the place where the placenta adheres, and from the aperture and orifice of each of
the tubes ;
with all the veins and velfels communicating to and from the placenta
and the mother, furcharged with blood ;
but it isalmoft impoffible to demonftrate
regular plans of velfels and fibres, continued any length, without an interruption
which involves us in doubt, and deftroys that view of the admirable connexion
which nature has formed between the vital organs of the mother and child in a ftate
of advanced pregnancy.
From the foregoing obfervations wr
e may fafely conclude, that the mafs of blood
is the univerfal medium by which life is propagated, and health preferved, to every
clafs
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 345
clafs of beings ;
and that, in its impure or infedted ftate, it is the fource from
whence the endlefs number of hereditary difeafes derive their origin. Whatever
fault impairs the parent blood, fails not to taint the tender habit of its young
;
whence it has become an eftablifhed maxim, that, as healthy parents naturally
produce healthy. children, fo difeafed parents as naturally produce a difeafed off-
fpring. Some of thefe difeafes appear in the earlieft infancy ;
others occur equally
at all ages; whilft others lurk unfufpe&ed in the habit to extreme old age, or even
to a new generation, flowly impairing the vital organs, and gradually undermining
the conftitution, before their fource, andffatal tendency, can poflibly be difcovered.
There are fome difeafes indeed, which, though born with us, cannot be faid to be
derived from the parent, as when a foetus receives fome hurt by an injury done
to the mother; while others, neither born with us nor having any foundation in,
the conftitution, are fucked in with the nurfe’s milk. Let it then be the care of
every parent, who from fome local misfortune is fo far compelled to depart from
the ties of nature as to abandon her tender offspring to the breaftof another, to be
fatisfied, as far as human forefight and medical penetration can reach, that the
conftitution and blood of the nurfe be free from fcrophula and every other here-
ditary impurity.
Accidental difeafes, though not derived from the parents, nevert'helefs in general
fpring from the blood ;
which, conftituting or propagating animal life through every
part of the body, is neceftarily expofed to every external offending caufe, from
which impreftion particular accidental difeafes enfue. The climate, itfelf, under
which people live, will often produce thefe affedlions in the blood ;
and every par-
ticular climate hath more or lefs a tendency to produce a particular difeafe, either
from its excefs of heat or cold, or from the mutability of the weather. An im-
menfe number of difeafes are alfo produced in the blood by impure air, or fuch as
is loaded with putrid, marfhy, and other noxious, vapours. The fame thing like-
Avife happens from high-feafoned or corrupted aliment, whether meat or drink ;
though even the beft and moft nutritious aliment will hurt, if taken in too great a
quantity; not to mention poifons, which are endowed with fuch pernicious quali-
ties, that, even when taken in the fmalleft quantity, they produce the moft grievous
ferment in the blood, ending perhaps with death itfelf. There are likewife other
accidents and dangers to which mankind are expofed, that ingraft innumerable
difeafes in the mafs of blood ;
fuch as the bite of venomous reptiles, or of a
mad dog; an injudicious inoculation or mis-treatment of the fmall-pox, or meafles;
the pfora, or itch; the venereal infeftion ; alfo broken limbs, wounds, and contu-

fions; which, though proceeding from an external caufe at firft, foil not to impair
the blood, and often terminate in internal difeafes and premature death.
Man, however, is not left without defence againft fo many and fuch great dan-
gers. The human body is poffeffed of a moll wonderful power, by which it
preferves itfelf from difeafes, keeps off many, and in a very fhort time cures fume
already begun, while others are by the fame means more {lowly brought to a
happy conclusion. This power, called the autrocratcia, or vis mediccitrix natural,
is well known both to phyficians and philofophers, by whom it is moft juftly cele-
brated; for this alone is fufficient for curing many difeafes, and is of fervice in
all. Nay, even the beft medicines operate only by exciting and properly direct-
ing this expulfive force, by which the excrementitious humours from the aliments
and blood are expelled, through the proper channels of evacuation, through the
excretory duCts, chiefly by means of the infenfible perfpiration, by which power
the offending humours from the blood and juices are perpetually flying off. But
though phyficians juftly put confidence in this power, and though it generally cures
difeafes of a (lighter kind, yet it is not to be thought that thofe of a more grievous
tendency are to be left to the unaffifted efforts of Nature. Phyficians have there-
fore a two-fold error to avoid, namely, either defpifing the powers of the vis me-
dicatrix too much, which, if left alone, would work a radical and perfeCt cure ; or,
putting too great confidence in thefe exertions of nature, they are left unfeconded
and alone, till the virulence of infection or difeafe undermines the conftitution, and
bears down all before it.
The grand and perpetual means by which the foul and offending humours in the
blood and juices are continually carried off, is undoubtedly through the perfpi-
rative pores and veffels, which it is highly compatible with found health to keep
open, and for which purpofe medicaments are principally ufed. When this eva-
cuation is copious and grofs enough to be difeerned by the eye, as in fweat, the
perfpiration is faid to be fenfible; but where it is fo volatile as to efcape the notice
of the fenfes, as is the cafe in the ordinary ftate of the body, it is called infenfible
perfpiration.—The veffels through which the perfpiration is performed lie obliquely
open under the fquamae or ficales of the cuticle or fcarf-fkin. They are inconceiv-
ably fmall ;
from a calculation of Leeuwenhoek it appears, that the mouths of one
hundred and twenty-five thoufand of them may be covered with a common grain
of fand. The moft confiderable of thefe pores are the orifices of the du6ts arifing
from the miliary glands. Through thefe veffels there is continually tranfuding a
fubtle humour, from every point of the body, and throughout the whole expanfe
of"the cuticle. The matter evacuated this way is found by certain experience to
be
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 347
fre more than equal to that evacuated- all the other ways, i. e. by ftool, urine, &c.
San6torious found in Italy, under the circumftances of a moderate diet, middle
age, and eafy life, that the matter infenfibly perfpired was five-eighths of that which*
was taken in for food : fo that there only remained three-eighths for nutrition, and
for the excrements of the nofe, ears, inteftines, bladder, &c.
The fame author fhow's, that as much is evacuated by infenfible perfpiration in
one day as by ftool in fourteen days ;
particularly that, in the fpace of a night’s
time, about fixteen ounces are ordinarily difcharged by urine, four ounces by ftool,
and above forty ounces by infenfible perfpiration. He alfo obferves, that, if a
man eat and drink eight pounds in a day, five pounds of it are fpent in infenfible
perfpiration ;
and adds, as to the times, that within five hours after eating there is
perfpired about one pound ;
from the fifth to the twelfth hour about three pounds;
and from the twelfth to the fixteenth fcarcely half a pound. M. Dodart, from
a number of experiments made thirty-three years fucceftively, proves that we
perfpire much more in youth than in age. In fome perfons the perfpiration is fo
copious, that they void very little of the coarfer excrements, though they eat hear-
tily. The benefits of infenfible perfpiration are fo great, that without it animal
life could not be preferved. The general caufe of perfpiraion is the circulation
and heat of the blood, which enables it to throw off the offending matter. The
great fubtlety, equability, and plenty, of the matter thus perfpired, its increafe
after deep, &c. conftitute the grand fymptoms of a perfe6t ftate of health ;
and the
chief means of preferving the fame. On the contrary, the departing from thefe is
the firft fure fign of approaching difeafe.
Perfpiration is performed, preferved and increafed, by the vifcera, veffels, and
fibres ;
by motion or exercife as far as the firft appearance of fweat ;
by moderate
ufe of venery ;
by deep of feven or eight hours, the body well covered, yet not
loaded with bed-clothes : cheerfulness ;
light, fermented, yet folid, food, not fat
;
pure, not heavy, air, &c. The contraries of all thefe, as alfo the increafe of the
other excretions, diminifti, prevent, and deprave, it. Hence we fee the caufe and
effect of this perfpirable matter, its ufe in preferving the parts foft and flexible/
and in fupplying what is loft, but chiefly in preferving the nervous papillae moift,
frefti, lively, and fit to be affe6ted by objects, and to tranfmit their impreflions.
Hence it is, that upon a ftoppage of the ufual perfpiration there arife fo many in-
difpofitions, particularly fevers, agues, rheums, &c. Too much perfpiration oc-
cafions weaknefs, and fwoonings ;
whilft too little, or none at all, occafions the ca-
pillary veffels to dry, wither, and perifh. Hence alfo the larger emun&ories come
to be obftru&ed ;
hence the circulation is difturbed, tharp humours retained ; and
• hence

hence putridity, crudity, fevers, inflammations, and impofthumes. Cold prevents-
perfpiration, by conftringing the pores of the fkin, and thickening the liquors cir-
culating in the cutaneous glands; heat, on the contrary, augments it, both by
opening the excretory dufts of the glands, and by ipcreafing the fluidity and velo-
city of the humours. To determine the (late and condition of the perfpiration, fo
neceflary for judging of tliofe of the body, Sanftorius invented a weighing-chair,
whereby no examined the quantity, degree, &c. of perfpiration in feveral circum-
ftances of the body, under feveral temperatures of the air, arid in the feveral inter-
vals of eating, drinking, fleeping, &c.
Some of 'the more extraordinary phenomena obferved' in this fpeculation, are,
that, for fome time after eating, the perfpiration is leaft of all ;
that between the
fifth and twelfth hour after meals perfpiration is greateft ;
that riding either on
horfeback, in a coach, or fliip, &c. fwift motion on the ice, See. but, above all, a,
briik friftion of the fkin, promote perfpiration furprifmgly : and that perfpiration
is naturally always much lefs in women than in men. Perfpiration is influenced
by the paflions of the mind. Thus anger and joy increafe, and fear and fadnefs
leffen, both perfpiration and urine. Anger caufes a ftrong motion in the mem-
branes of the heart, and quickens its contraftion and dilatation, and thereby quic-
kens the contraftion and dilatation of the blood-vetfels and fecerning dufts, and of
confequence increafes the difeharges of perfpiration and urine ;
and that more or
lefs, in proportion to the firength and continuance of the paflion. Joy affefts
thefe difeharges in like manner as anger. In the paflions of fear and forrow, per-
fpiration and urine are leflened, by the deprefiion of the aftivity of the' foul under
thofe paflions. The proportion of perfpiration to urine is increafed by all thofe
exercifes which increafe the motion of the blood, and warm the fkin.
We have an account of a perfon who, by pafling many nights in aftronomical fpe-
culations, had his perfpiration fo obftrudted by the cold and damp of the air in Hol-
land, that a fhirt he had worn for five or fix weeks was as clean as if it had been
worn but one day. The confequence of this was, that he gathered fubcutaneous
waters, but was cured in time. The garments beft calculated to encourage and
promote infenfible perfpiration, to keep the mouths of the minute veffels open, and
to guard the body from the too fudden and violent efiefts of cold are thofe made
of flannel. Whence flannel fliirts and waiftcoats, or a fquare piece of flannel worn
over the breaft or pit of the ftornach, particularly in the winter months, are produc-
tive of fuch beneficial effects to weakly and debilitated conftitutions, and aft as a
valuable prefervative to the hale and robuft. Id the annexed copper-plate engrav-
ing, I have endeavoured to fliow the manner in which the infenfible perfpiration
ifliie*

iffues from the pores of the body, which can only be difcerned by means of a lens ;
being of fo volatile and fubtle a quality, that it palfes through our garments with
the utmoft eafe, particularly if woollen ;
and it even afcends through the bed-
clothes like a mitt, in the greateft abundance when we are afleep, and the animal
functions are at reft.
In this manner Nature, from all cafual obftru6tions, endeavours to relieve her-
felf ;
and, fo long as difeafes are recent, and of a mild tendency, they are ufually
carried off by this means, without requiring any aid from medicine. When, how-
ever, difeafes are of long (landing, and the humours in the blood become too foul
and vifcous to be thrown off by the vis medicatrLv natures, the whole habit is
quickly vitiated, and the circulating mafs becomes morbid ;
yet even in this in-
fedled (late, the vital heat and a6livity of the blood drives to purify itfelf, by deter
mining thefe morbid particles to the (kin, where they form fcabs, ulcers, pimples,
and other fpots, as in the fcrophula, leprofy, fmall-pox, meafles, fyphilis, &c. or
elfe the virulent matter is directed inwards, where falling upon the lungs and other
vifeera, death quickly enfues. Here then we may view the (hocking confequences
which refult to thofe who enter into matrimony under a tainted or infe6ted (late
of the blood. Indeed perfons that are affli<5ted with the leprofy, fcrophula, or
king’s evil, (liould never marry until a perfe6t cure has been effe6led, and a
pure and healthful (late of the blood induced. To enter into wedlock under a
venereal taint, is a mod unwife, a mod cruel, and an ungenerous a6t. A man w7
ith
only a dight infe6tion, by conta6l with the woman, will himfelf perhaps experience
a perfect cure, in confequence of the foul and infectious matter being drawn from
the parts of the female organs, feconded by the action of the rugas and abforbent
veffels on the furface of the vagina. But the unhappy female is fure to take the
diforder; and, (hould (he prove with child, (he not only carries the poifonous in-
fection into the marrow of her own bones, but brings an infant offspring into the
• world, devoted to mifery and difeafe; for whatever foul or infectious humour is
implanted in the parent blood, it is immediately carried by the circulation to the vital
organs of the child, juft asthe flame of one candle is by contaCt communicated to
another. Nor can we be furprifed at thefe things, if we only refleCt on what has
already been adduced, and contemplate the fyftem and oeconomy of the human
frame. Conftder only the powerful effeCts of a few grains of cantharides, which,
if externally applied, a6t as a burning cauftic ; but, if taken into the ftomach, in-
ftantly overturn the natural courfe of the circulation, by forcing the whole mafs of
blood into the extremities, but more particularly, with great vehemence and turgi-
dity, into the private parts ;
for which reafon cantharides are taken with intent to

cure the weaknefs and debility of the penis; but the truth is, that greater debility,
and an emaciated conftitution, are fure to follow, and not unfrequently inftant
death.
If, then, fo powerful an effedt can be wrought on the blood by fwallowing a few
irritating particles of a fmall infedt, may we not juftly infer, that by infufing into
the circulating mafs particles congenial to itfelf, the utmoft relief may be afforded
to it, even in its moft depraved and inadtive {fate ? From this confideration alone,
we may venture to pronounce, that all diforders originating in the blood might
either be prevented or repelled, could fuch a medium be difcovered, by which we
might infufe immediately into the mafs a combination of fuch elemental principles
as the blood and juices themfelves confift of in their pureft and moft elaitic ftate ;
for this, in fadt, is the aim of all medicines ;
but which they mifs, by being admi-
niftered in their grofs form, and being obliged to pafs the feveral digeftive opera-
tions of the ftomach, before they can reach the blood, whereby the principal part
of their occult virtue is loft among the food, or fecreted in fuch fmall quantities as
to produce very little effedt. But a medium, poffeffing thefe congenial principles,
ready digefted, and fo combined as to be taken inftantly, and without diminution,
into the habit, would not only keep the cruor and the ferum in due proportion,
which is fo effential to health, but would ftimulate, corredt, purify, and augment,
the blood, as its reduced or difordered ftate might from time to time require. Such
a medium, after infinite labour, and unlimited experience, I pronounce the Solar
Tindture to be; and fuch will be found its operative effedts, under whatever circum-
ftances it may be adminiftered, in any climate or feafon ;
the innocent and bal-
famic qualities of which are as grateful to the internal organs of the human frame
as the folar rays are cheering to the external ;
and it affords me no fmall grati-
fication to affert, that, in offering it to the public, I invade no man’s property,
nor imitate any medicine at prefent known in public or private pradtice. —The expe-
riments I have made with it upon a variety of difeafed wretched objedts, exceed
belief; and I fliall ftill continue to admimfter it gratis to the poor, who are given
over by others, or who have not the means of applying for medical afiiftance.
The infinite variety of complaints an impure or infedted ftate of the blood in-
duces, almoft exceeds belief; and hence the new and deceptive forms a fcrophulous
or fcorbutic taint puts on, which often deceive the moft eminent of the faculty,
and baffle the beft intention towards a cure. An impure or fcrophulous taint will
invade the nobleft organs of the human frame, before the patient can be aware of
his danger. In the firft ftage of its vifible effedts, a weary pain feizes the joints and
mufcles, attended with a wafting of the legs and loins. In the fecond ftage, the
gums fwell, grow painful, hot, and irritable, and bleed upon the flighteft preffure
;
the

the roots of the teeth become bare and loofe, and the breath naufeous. \ In the
third ffage, the gums grow putrid, the teeth black and rotten, the fuhlingular veins
become varicofe, and the breath cadaverous; foetid blood diffils from the lips,
gums, mouth, nofe, lungs, ffomach, liver, fpleen, pancreas, inteftines, womb, kid-
neys, &c. fcabs and ulcers break out in all parts of the body; and the joints, bones,
and vifeera, become morbid. In the fourth ftage, putrid, eruptive, and fpotted,
fevers, enfue, which end in an atrophy; or elfe follow diarrhoeas, dyfentery, drop-
fy, conl'umption, palfy, contractions, melanchoty, and all the long and direful
train of nervous diforders, which to deferibe would fill a volume.
To counteract this molt virulent of all chronic complaints, the utmoft exertions
of human (kill have been employed. The remedies preferibed in its different ftages
are almoft innumerable. The objeCt is to reduce the virulence of the infeCtion, and
to eradicate its feeds from the blood and lymph ;
to which end the mildeftand moft
fimple medicines are recommended. Mineral and tar waters, for their warm and
ftimulating quality ;
milk or whey, from their fimilitude to the chyle ;
the cold bath,
for bracing the folids and quickening the circulation ;
antifcorbutic vegetables,
See. for purging and fweetening the blood, fuch as feurvy-grafs, water-creffes,
wormwood, hemlock, centaury, vervain, water-trefoil, juniper-berries, the Peru-
vian bark, faffafras, guaiacum, aloes, affa-foetida, camomile, diafeordium, faffron,
fenna, rhubarb, manna, /Ethiop’s mineral, hartfhorn, native cinnabar, antimony,
&c. When thefe fail, mercury, or a mercurial falivation, is looked upon as the
only cure ;
which, in fact, is but to give the human frame its laft vehement
fhock, and to fend the wretched patient in agonies to the grave !
The intention of all thefe remedies is to impregnate the blood with qualities op-
pofite to thofe with which it is infeCted ;
and this muftbe done in a fuperior degree
of force and power, before a cure can be completed. But thefe medicaments are
often adminiftered under fuch naufeous forms, and in fo crude and unqualified a
ftate, that they not only torture the patient, but mifs entirely their intended aim.
The naufeous taffe of medicine is nothing but its groffer particles ;
which, in-
ftead of entering the ffomach, to irritate and opprefs its organs, ought to be
drawn off by chemical procefs ;
for it is the occult virtue of every drug, not its
groffer part, that performs the cure. Now the peculiar excellence of the Solar
Tinblure is, that it combines the effential and occult virtues of all the fcorbutic
vegetables, ready digefted, conco&ed, purified, and refolved into an elegant bal-
famic effence, pleafing to the taffe and grateful to the ffomach. It flies im-
mediately to the heart, whether internally or externally applied, blends and aflimi-
lates with the venal and arterial blood, which it generates, corrects, warms, pu-
rifies,
552 A KEY TO PHYSIC
rifles, animates, and impels through the whole fydem. It cleanfes all the vifcera,
and glandular parts, particularly the lungs and kidneys ;
dimulates the fibres,
whereby the gadric juice and digedion are promoted ;
diffolves vifcid humours,
and expels infeCtion. It exerts very confiderable effe6ts on the whole nervous
fydem, fenfibly raifes the pulfe, drengthens the folids, and invigorates the animal
fpirits. It penetrates into the mod intimate parts, opens the mouths of the minuter
veffels, redores the natural perfpiratiftn, and promotes all the fluid fecretions. In
every dage of infectious difeafes, and in all fudden epidemical diforders, which
ufually follow from a wet, putrid, and unwholefome, date of the atmofphere, it is
an abfolute fpecific ;
and, as a preventive, an alterative, and purifier of the blood,
it has not its equal in the world. It quickly relieves every common malady ori-
ginating in the blood, fuch as relaxations, debility, laffitude, tremors, finking of the
fpirits, and all thofe nervous affeCtions which harafs and opprefs the weak, fe-
dentary, and delicate; and are often the confequences of high living and luxuriant
indulgences, without bodily exercife and frefli air. In all thefe cafes, the Solar
Tindure is calculated to warm and deady the cold tremulous nerves ;
to flieath and
invigorate the mufcular fyftem ;
to animate the fpirits ;
and renovate the whole
man ;
w'hereby the chill watery fluids become rich and balfamic, and the circu-
lating ^mafs refumes its healthful date. It is an infallible cure for joint-achs,
cramps, fpafms, rheumatic gout, nervous head-ach, agues, and all diforders
arifing from obdru&ed perfpiration. In complaints of the bread, domach, and
bowels, it gives immediate relief; and, in adhmatic and confumptive cafes, is an
elegant and expeditious cure. It will dop mortification in very advanced dages,
by expelling the poifonous matter, and correcting the juices of the whole body-
It requires no argument to convince, more than a Angle trial ;
after which, I
think, no family who value their health or life will choofe to be without it
;
par-
ticularly under any of the following afflictions :
SCROPHULA, SCURVY, or KING’s EVIL.
IN the fird and fecond dages of this diforder, a fmall table-fpoonful of the
TinCture, taken in a wine-glafs of cold fpring w ater night and morning, will pre-
vent the further progrefs of the difeafe, and in a very fhort time redore the blood
to its healthful date, the effeCts of which will be fo obvious to the patient, that he
will be at no difficulty when to difcontinue the medicine. In the third dage, it is
often requifite that the medicine be internally and externally applied. The mouth
Ihould be frequently wafhed with the TinCture diluted in warm-water ;
and it will
very foon expel the poifon from the gums. If the vifcera be in a morbid date, which
may

may be known by the excrements, or foulnefs of ex peroration, it will be neceffary
to take the medicine, night and morning, for feveral days, in the quantity of a
table fpoonful undiluted
;
and, at noon, a table-fpoonful in the fame quantity of
warm water. The fcabs, whether dry or moift, fhould be frequently walked with
the Tindture, undiluted, which, being abforbed by the minuter velfels, and taken
into the habit, will expel the humour, and clear away the fcurf. If tumours or foul
ulcers occur, wafh them frequently with a dilution of the medicine in the fame
quantity of warm-water, until the heat and virulence be abated ;
then apply the
Tindture undiluted, with lint or fine rags, by which means the infedtious matter
will be totally eradicated, the blood and juices purified, and the ulcers healed.
In the fourth ftage, whatever may chance to be the fad malady to which the dis-
order ultimately turns, a ftridt attention to regimen, exercife, and frefh air, as far as
the ftrength and condition of the patient will admit, muft be particularly attended
to. And, in all thele cafes, the heft and moft fimple methods of treatment are laid
down in the Medical Part of this work, p. 1(58, See. to which I beg leave to refer every
patient in this dreadful Page of the difeafe; and, in aid of the advice there given,,
let the Solar Tindture be regularly perfifted in every night and morning, in the
quantity of one table-fpoonful in as much warm water; and, at twelve o’clock,at
noon, take a table-fpoonful undiluted. —Let this be continued eight or ten days;;
then take a table-fpoonful diluted in warm w^ater three times a-day, morning, noon,
and night, till the nerves and organs begin to refume their healthful tone; then let
the dofes be gradually abated to a fpoonful in water every other morning, which
fhould be continued till health is perfedtly re-eftablifhed ;
and which, by God’s
bleffing, will generally happen, even in thefe defperate cafes, in the courfe of a
month or hx w-eeks.—As a preventive of all foul or fcrophulous taints in the ha-
bit, and as an alterative, and purifier of- the blood, it may be occafionaily taken
every other morning for a week together, particularly in the fpring and fall, in the
quantity of a table-fpoonful in a wine-glafs of cold fpring water ;
or it may be occa-
lionally taken as a beverage after dinner or fupper, mixed in a tumbler with warm
water, and made palatable with fugar. It will be found pleafant to the tafte, and
grateful to the ftomach, fuperior to any fpirits, or punch. The many inftances
of elegant and uncommon cures effected by the Solar Tindture, on perfons of the
firft eminence, may be infpedted at any time, on application at my houfe. But at
the particular requeft of the parties, I have here added the following remarkable
CASE.
Mr. R. Pinder, ofBramftone, near Bridlington, in Yorkfhire, had been long
afHidted with a violent fcorbutic humour in his blood, which threw out fometimes

354 A KEY TO PHYSIC
dry, and fometimes moift, fcabs and tumours on the fkin. Being negledted, it at
length pervaded the whole fyftem, till, turning inwardly, it fell upon his lungs, and
reduced him to the laft ftage of a confumption. In this deplorable Hate, given
over by the faculty, left totally emaciated, and incapable of turning in his bed, he
fortunately had recourse to the Solar Tindture. The firft dofe was given undiluted,
which threw him into a fine perfpiration, and compofed him to lleep, which had
long been a ftranger to his eyes. After one large bottle had been adminiftered,
agreeable to the bill of directions, at the end of a week he was fo much reftored,
that with very little affiftance he was enabled to put on his own clothes; and, after
continuing the medicine for little more than a month, he was able to walk abroad.
And now, after having continued the Tindture night and morning, and occafion-
ally ufing it as a beverage made fimilar to warm brandy and water, he has quite
recovered his former health and ftrength ;
being, to the furprife of every body who
beheld him in his late emaciated condition, as robuft and as hearty as it is well
poffible for a man to be.
DEBILITATED, TAINTED, and ENFEEBLED, CONSTITUTIONS.
MUSCULAR debility was a misfortune but little known to our forefathers.
Whether immured in venereal embraces, or facrificing at the fiirine of Bacchus,
moderation and feafonabie hours directed the meafure of their enjoyment. If re-
velry or voluptuoufnefs by chance unftrung their nerves, gymnaftic exercifes and
field-fports, or the more pleafurable delights of the chace, quickly reftored them
to their proper tone,—gave new vigour to the blood,—health to the cheek, —and
lighted up afrefh the flame of love. But now, how ftrange is the reverie. Ha-
bituated to effeminacy, and fed with dainties,—revelling all night with wine, and
ftretched on beds of down all day,—fliut up in ftews and brothels, fcarcely breath-
ing wholefome air,—clafped in the arms of tainted or difeafed females, until en-
joyment palls upon the fenfes, and the mufcular powers abfolutely refufe their
office;—no wonder fo many men are found old in every thing but years; whole
conftitutions are fairly worn down, blood ftagnant, folids relaxed, Accretions di-
verted from their proper courfe, mufcles debilitated, eyes funk, cheek pallid, and
fpirits gone. Thefe are not half the evils refulting from this fafhionable fource of
deftrudtive folly. It may not be amifs, however, to defcribe the remarkable cafes
of a few, of whom the Solar TinCture has made perfedt cures, by infufing a new
portion of health into the mafs of blood ;
fincerely hoping, that a more wife and
manly courfe of life will fliortly eradicate thefe difgraceful complaints, and reftore
to the ladies a genuine race of Englifhmep and Britons.

Premature Debility. —A gentleman in the army, under thirty years of
age, complained to me that he had all at once become incapable of enjoying his
xvije. SufpeCting the nature of his diforder, I defired him to be open and candid,
to relate to me his real fituation, and not a pretended one, which was only to im~
pofe on his own underftanding. He thanked me for the rebuke—faid he would
be frank, and in a few words declared, That from exceflive lull, and continual de-
bauch, he had loft his virility; and, to add to the misfortune, he was on the eve
of being married. In other refpeCts he felt no diminution in his health or confti-
tution ;
and, from external appearances, this was furely the laft imperfection that
could have been fufpeCted. His complexion was vigorous and lively, his flefh
firm, and conformation excellent; yet, notwithftanding this, he was impotent to
fuch a degree, that neither the ftrength of his own defires, nor the excitations of
the female, could affeCt the part. It often happens, that, though the organs remain
found, yet, if the nervous and feminal fluids have degenerated from a healthful
ftate—if they are impoverifhed by being too much drained, or turned into an un-
natural courfe—they cannot then perform their office, by reafon that their moving
powers and ftimulus on the blood are become too weak to direCt their force and
action in the manner nature requires in the a6t of copulation. I therefore en-
joined him, to abftain entirely from all attempts of the kind, for three months at
leaft; directed the ointment as in p. 240 ofthe Medical Part of this work, with the
SolarTinCture three times a-day for two months ; then twice a-day, until he found
it no longer necefiary. After taking fix large bottles, he generoufly thanked me
for a more hale and robuft ftate of body than he ever remembered to have enjoyed
before. He has fince fent me feveral patients, in almoft as debilitated a ftate as
himfelf, who are now ready to unite with him in giving full teftimony to the reno-
vating powers and peculiar efficacy of the Solar TinCture,
A RELAXED HABIT.
LITTLE more than three months ago, a gentleman, about fifty years of age,
lately returned from the Eaft-Indies, applied to me for the cure of what he termed
a broken conjlitution. He had made very free with the fable beauties of Bengal
—had undergone a mercurial falivation, and appeared to be finking under an uni-
verfal languor and debility of the whole mufcular fyftem. The fphinCter of the
bladder was fo weakened, that the urinary fecretion came from him by drops, in
fo perpetual and involuntary a manner, as not to be perceived until the moifture
of one fet of cloths became fo fen£bly afflicting as made it necefiary to fupply

frefh ones, which ufually happened every hour. The corporeal fundtions were-
diffipated and relaxed, the tone of the ftomach and vifcera was nearly gone, the
tremulous nerves reludlantly performed their office, and the circulation was become
ftagnant and morbid. I advifed an immediate recourfe to the moft nouriffiing
food, with ftrong port-wine negus for his drink, and the Solar Tindture to be taken
four times a~day for the firft month ;
three times a-day for the fecond month, and
once or twice a-day afterwards, as occafion might feem to render neceffary. Be-
fore the expiration of twenty days, the fphindter mufcle acquired its proper tope,
the pulfe became ftrong and regular, and the nervous tremors were conflderably
abated. By the end of the fecond month, a renovation of the whole animal ceco-
nomy feerned to have taken place, and a vilible accumulation of the blood and
juices had retrieved the circulation. Before the expiration of three months, I had
the gratification to fee this patient completely reftored to fuch a {late of bodily-
health and ftrength, as utterly aftonillied himfelf, after taking only eight large;
bottles of the Solar Tindlure.
HYPOCHONDRIACAL DEBILITY, or WEAK NERVES;
A GENTLEMAN in Oxfordfliire lately came to town on purpofe to confulfc:
me in his complaint. He appeared to be near thirty years of age, of middling
flature, but of a weakly conftitution. He had for upwards of feven years paft paid
his addrefifes to a lady, whom he had long promifed, and very much defired, to
marry ;
but, whenever he propofed in his mind to fix the day, or whenever it hap-
pened that he attempted to falute or embrace her, he was feized with an unaccount-
able tremor of the w'hole body, his fpirits funk, his virility left him, and a violent
palpitation of the heart enfued. In fhort, he was fo diftruftful of his own powers, that
he confeffed it was the fear of not being able to perform the rites of the marriage-bed
that had been the real and the foie caufe of thus protra&ing his wedding-day..
This is certainly a molt fingular inftance of the hypochondriacal affedlion, and of
its derangement of the nervous fyftem. The debility induced by it, feems to arife
from the weaker energy of the brain, the fault of which, however, cannot be detedled
by the niceft anatomifl. For this reafon, we do not well know how fuch defedt ffiould
be reftored; but as nature, feemingly for this purpofe, excites the motion of the heart
and arteries, we mull afcribethe continuance of fuch debility to the too-weak reac-
tion of the fanguiferous fyftem. The heart will generally palpitate from a violent ex-
citement of the nerves, efpecially w'ljen the blood is endowed with too fmall a {hare
of ftimulus. Hence palpitation from any affedlion of the mind, and from hyfterics
in w omen. Under whatever circumftances this hypochondriacal affedlion happens,
it debilitates the whole animal machine, and renders the perfon unable to perform
the proper offices of life. The proftration of fpirits, weaknefs, and languor, are
often
«
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 557
often furprifingly great, though the pulfe feems tolerably ftrong, as being heightened
by animal defire. The effedt, however, is fure to produce a languid circulation,
the blood feeming to adhere, with uncommon energy, about the region of the
heart. I fufpe6t it is in thefe cafes that cantharides are moll frequently ufed. The
patient acknowledged, after fome hefitation, that he had tried them ;
but they only
produced an involuntary though violent eredtion, by no means adapted to the
cure, nor to the purpofe he intended. Hence this remedy is not only inadequate,
but extremely dangerous ;
for it too much exhaufts the vital powers, and is follow-
ed by a vaft dejedtion of fpirits, tremors, ftartings of the tendons, &c. which bring
on rigours, cold clammy fweats, fyncope, and often premature death.
The means, therefore, which nature points out for the cure of this fpecies of
debility, are diredfed to fupport and increafe the a&ion of the blood through the
heart and arteries ;
and the remedies to be employed are tonics and ftimulants. Of
all the ftimulants, which in this conftitutional defedl may be advantageoufly em-
ployed, port-wine feems to be the moft eligible. It has the advantage of being
grateful to the palate and ftomach, and of having its ftimulant parts fo much di-
luted, that it can be conveniently given at all times and feafons, and may be em-
ployed with fufficient caution; but it is of little fervice unlefs taken pretty large-
ly.—It may be fufpedled that wine has an operation analagous to that of opium ;
and on good grounds. But we can diftindtly mark its ftimulant power only
;
which renders its effedts in the phrenitic delirium manifeftly hurtful, but in cafes
of debility as remarkably ufeful.—Hence I diredled the Solar Tin6ture to be taken
morning, noon, and night, in ftrong dofes, for the firft month ;
once a-day, or
oftener, at the difcretion of the patient, until the end of the third month ;
but to
drink every day after dinner, a pint of generous port ;
and to inform me at intervals
the change he might find in his conftitution. He took with him a dozen large
bottles of the Solar Tincture ;
and before a month elapfed, I had the pleafure of
receiving an epiftle of unfeigned thanks. He found himfelf fo much reftored by
the courfe I laid him under, that, before the expiration of the three months, he
married the lady ;
and I have no douht will very fhortly have ifiue.—I have been
fomewhat more elaborate in defcribing the particulars of this cafe, having reafon
to believe it is not an uncommon malady ;
and would therefore wifti to enable
every patient to become as much as polftble a judge of his own infirmity.
NOCTURNAL EMISSIONS, or INCONTINENCE of the SEMEN.
A YOUNG man, of robuft make, and in the prime of life, being under twenty-
fix years of age, applied to me for relief in the above unfortunate complaint. It
appeared, that, from the time of puberty, he had found a weaknefs in the part, and
No. 23. 4 Y an
358 A KEY TO PHYSIC
an occafional difcharge of the feed, upon the flighteft irritation. As he grew up
to greater maturity, the malady increafed upon him. Upon every attempt to have
contact with a female, femen paffed involuntarily from him, before even a com-
plete eredtion could take place, whereby his purpofe was continually defeated.
This defedt grew upon him, until the bare fight or thought of any thing which
tended to excite venereal defires brought away the feed; yet it had no affinity
whatever to a gleet, becaufe the emiffion never occurred but either in the attempt
or in the defire of copulation, or under the influence of lafcivious dreams. In
proportion as this weaknefs grew upon him, his defire of familiarity with the fex
became the ftronger ;
and, I am inclined to think, was the principal reafon of the
increafe of the malady, and of the nodturnal emiffions, which happened more or
lefs every time he went to fleep. This incelfant difcharge had reduced him to a
meagre vifage, fallow complexion, hollow eyes, depreffion of fpirits, and flow' fever;
and a galloping confumption would foon have followed. I diredted the Solar Tinc-
ture every morning at fun-rifing, at mid-day, and at fix o’clock in the afternoon,
in the quantity of a wine-glafs full, with one-third warm w'ater ; and every night
at going to bed, twenty drops of liquid laudanum, for the purpofe of making his
fleep too ftrong to be affedted by the influence of dreams. This courfe, aflifted by
a ftrengthening regimen of calf’s-foot jelly, veal-broth, and ftrong port-wine
negus, had very quickly the deftred effed!. His fleep was perfedtly found and
calm, and, after the firft night, he could not recoiled! the return of any nodturnal
emiflion. The ftrengthening ointment, diredted in page 240 of the Medical Part
of my w'ork, was ufed every other morning ;
and within the fpace of only two
months, the feminal veffels w'ere completely braced up, and the diforder fo to-
tally removed, as not to leave a Angle fymptom of his former weaknefs.
ONANISM.
A YOUTH, apparently under age, applied to me for the cure of a diforder,
which, he faid, had deprived him of the power of eredtion, and of all fenfation in
the privities. In fo young a fubjedt, I could not fuppofe this w'ant of tone to arife
from a general debility of the nervous fyftem, particularly as no other fymptoms
warranted the conclufion. I had a ftrong fufpicion it was the effedt of Onanifrn, or
fecret venery, which ufually ends in this fpecies of abfolute impotency ;
but this he
denied. He told me he had fome time ago contradled the foul diftemper, and
through fliame, and the dread of its coming to the knowledge of his friends, he
had negledted to difclofe his misfortune to any perfon, until the prefent malady w'as
brought on. Of the foul diftemper, however, I could find no other fymptom than
a Ample gleet ;
and, upon putting the neceffary queftions, not a Angle reply corre-
fponded
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 359
fponded with the ufual effedts of that diforder. After half an hour’s clofe exami-
nation, I brought him to confefs what I above fufpedted, that he had fo much
addidted himfelf to this fhameful and deftrudtive vice, that the feminal veffels were
completely relaxed ;
the eredlories, the nerves, and glans, of the penis, had en-
tirely loft their tone ;
an involuntary difcharge of the femen, without irritation, or
turgidity of the parts, had long taken place, and brought on a want of appetite,
an impoverifhed ftate of the blood, and an univerfal laftitude of the body. The
le6ture I gave him upon this occafton, will never, I truft, be effaced from his me-
mory ;
and he has ftnce faithfully promifed that it lhall not. I diredted the {Length-
ening eledtuary and ointment, in page 239 and 240 of the Medical Part of this
Work, to be ufed as therein prefcribed ;
then to take, four times a-day, a table-
fpoonful of the Solar Tindture in an equal quantity of warm water, for a month at
leaft; then three times a-day for the fecond month, and twice a-day, in cold fpring-
water, for the two months following ;
which gradually coiled up the debilitated
parts, gave elafticity to the blood, retrieved the fenfation of the glans, and the
fympathetic office of the eredtories, braced the nerves, ligaments, and tendons, and
gave that due tone and energy to the mufcular fyftem, which in lefs than four
months reftored the patient to perfedt health and vigour.
An IMPURE or TAINTED HABIT.
THIS malady, fo common among our diftipated youth, generally arifes from a
venereal complaint badly cured. Indeed the fcrophula, the king’s evil, the
leprofy, and other foul humours, when too long fuffered to prey upon the blood,
will naturally induce this confequence ;
yet ninety-nine cafes out of every hundred,
are found to refult from the improper ufe of mercury, either taken 'too abun-
dantly into the ftomach, or too often applied externally, in the venereal difeafe. A
gentleman in the militia very lately came to me under this misfortune, who had
abfolutely worn down the organs of his ftomach by taking medicines for its cure,
without obtaining the fmalleft relief. He was no fooner warm in bed, than deep-
feated nodturnal pains attacked his arms, fttins, and head, which many of the faculty
miftook for rheumatifm. The membranes, mufcles, and ligaments, of the joints,
were fcarcely ever free from pain ; whilft carious ulcers occaftonally broke out up-
on the ulna, tibia, and bones of the cranium. Thefe fymptoms had alfo deceived
feveral of the faculty, who, taking his complaint to be a confirmed lues, ftill added
to the malady, by loading him with frefli dofes of mercury. The truth is, that
this diforder was by no means of a venereal nature, but was rather the confequence
of the remedy than of the difeafe, fmce it arofe entirely from the long and repeated
dofes of mercury his body had fuftained, and which was grounded in his habit by
falivatiom
360 A KEY TO PHYSIC
falivation. The mercury had infinuated itfelf into the marrow of his bones, had
vitiated every fluid fecretion, and tainted the very air he breathed. Under fuch
circumftances I will allow, it is very difficult, if not almoft impoflible, for a phyfi-
cian, upon a fuperfieial infpeXion, abfolutely to decide, whether the original dif-
eafe hath been altogether overcome ;
yet furely he ought attentively to diftinguiffi
and confider the feveral fymptoms apart ;
and then, by comparing them with each
other, a clear judgment may be formed upon the general review. Finding, by this
method, the real ftate of the patient’s cafe, I ordered him a nourilhing diet, gentle
exercife, and an abfolute denial of the fmalleft intercourfe with women. To this he
readily fubmitted, putting bimfelf under a regular courfe of the Solar TinXure,
which he took three times a-day, in the quantity of a wine-glafs three parts full, fil-
led up with warm water, for the firft month. At the expiration of this time he paid
me a vifit, when his company was infinitely more agreeable,
becaufe the pleafinw o-
dour of health had fuperfeded the naufeous effluvia of his difeafe. I now only enjoin-
ed him to follow the fame regimen and abstemious mode of living for a month or two
longer, taking theTinXure diluted in a glafs of cold fpring-water once or twice a-day}
as he might find himfelf inclined. This he rigidly attended to ;
and I have now the
pleafure tQ declare, that only nine large bottles of the Solar TinXure have reftored
this gentleman from the moft dangerous and deplorable ftate of a tainted and cor-
rupted habit, to found health, and a renovated ftate of the blood and juices.
A TAINTED HABIT in a STATE of PREGNANCY.
THIS is the moft fhocking cafe my praXice or experience ever produced. The
patient was taken in labour, and in the aX of parturition, the child prefented its
right arm, which feparated from the body, while the operator was returning it into
the womb. The life of the mother being defpaired of, I was fent for ;
when, on
infpeXion, I quickly perceived conception had taken place under an infeXed ftate
of one of the parents. I performed the refidue of the operation myfelf, and brought
away the foetus without a further feparation of the joints, but with great difficulty,
fince it was ulcerated and half rotten with difeafe. By a moft tender and judicious
treatment of the woman, affifted by the Lunar TinXure, her life was preferved ;
and in the fpace of five weeks fhe appeared to have regained her health and ftrength;
when, to the aftonifhment of every one, the fell into a violent falivation. Being
fent for upon this lingular occafion, I thought it right to interrogate the hulband
;
when, after a vaftdeal of hefitation and diffembling, he confelfed having had con-
nexion with his wife under a venereal infeXion ;
and, with a view to prevent the
confequences, he had prevailed on her to fwallow ftrong dofes of mercury, which I
have reafon to fuppofe lay dormant in the body until after her delivery ;
when the
efforts
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 361
efforts of nature being no longer dire6ted to the prefervation of the child, fuffered
the mercury to attack the falival glands, and to produce the effedt we have juft
defcribed. 1 ordered her a fpare but nourifhing diet ;
worked off the mercury in
the cuftomary way, and then began a courfe of the Solar Tindture. A table-fpoon-
ful, in an equal quantity of warm water, was taken four times a-day for the firft
week ;
then three times a-day until the end of the month ;
afterwards twice a-day
in cold fpring-water for a month longer ; and then once or twice a-day, or every
other day, as the patient found convenient; by this means die happily experienced
a complete cure in lefs than three months, and now enjoys a perfect ftate of health,
defiro us of certifying the fa6t to any unfortunate female, who, under fimilar circum-
ftances, withes to call upon me for that purpofe. Indeed every woman, who has
the misfortune to fufpedt even the fmalleft taint of a timilar nature to be lurking
in her blood, fliould put herfelf under a courfe of the Solar Tincture, and perfift
in it every night and morning, in the quantity of a table-fpoonful diluted in a wine-
glafs of cold fpring-water, during the whole nine months ftate of pregnancy.
The above cafe brings to my recollection a very lingular inftance of an accidental
falivation, brought upon a young lady by a foreign fubftance irritating one of the
parotid glands ;
the particulars of which I lhall here infert, for the fake of thofe
who may happen to be under timilar circumftances.—In the month of April, 1751,.
a young lady, about the age of fixteen years, of a delicate habit, but fubjeCt to no
particular complaints, perceived the beginning of a difeafe which afterwards proved
moft obftinate and loathfome, viz. an inceffant fpitting. The quantity of this dif-
charge was different at different times, varying from one pint to two pints and a
half in twenty-four hours. As to its quality, it feemed to be no other than the
ordinary fecretion of the falival glands. By fo large and conftant an evacuation,
her ftrength became extremely impaired ;
and the moft efficacious medicines had
proved ufelefs. She had taken large quantities of the Peruvian bark, both alone
and combined with preparations of iron ;
and afterwards the fetid gums, opium,
amber, alum, and the Neville-Holt water, had in fucceflion been given her. In
the mean time an exaCt regimen had been prefcribed, the had been ordered to ride
conftantly ;
and to confine herfelf to a mucilaginous diet, fuch as veal, calves’ feet,
&c. Likewife a gently-opening medicine had now and then been interpofed. The
difeafe ftill continued unaltered ;
Hie had afterwards tried the tinftura faturnina ;
and had, at the fame time, been encouraged to chew the Peruvian bark, and to
fwallow the faliva, But all thefe attempts had been vain ;
and after die had taken
fome or other of the medicines above-mentioned until the end of September, 1753,
namely, above two years, it appeared to her phyfician, Sir George Baker, unrea-
fonable to expedt relief in fuch a cafe from any internal medicines whatever. He
No. 23. 4 Z now
A KEY TO PHYSIC
362
now conceived a fufpicion, that fome extraneous body, having accidentally found
its way into the meatus auditorms, might poffibly be the caufe of this extraordi-
nary fecretion, by keeping up a continued irritation in the parotid glands. With
this view he examined her ears, and extracted from them a quantity of fetid wool.
How, or when, it came thither, no account could be given. To this fubftance he
attributed the beginning of the falivation, notwithftandiug that the difeafe did not
immediately abate on the removal of the wool; as it appeared to be no improbable
luppofition that the difcharge might be continued by the force of habit, though
the original caufe no longer remained. It feemed therefore expedient to introduce
fome other habit, in the place of the increafed fecretion of faliva ;
which habit
might afterwards be gradually left off. With this intention, he prevailed on the
patient to chew perpetually a little dry bread, and to fwallow it with her fpit-tie. In
a few weeks, it became neceffary for her to chew the bread only at certain hours in
the day; and thus, after two months, fhe became entirely free from a moft dif-
guftful and tedious diforder. It is worthy of obfervation, that, at full, the fwal-
lowing of fo much faliva frequently occafioned a naufea; and that then, for a few
hours, fhe was obliged to fpit it out as ufual; and that, during the greateft part
of the time, when ihe chewed the bread, fhe had a ftool or two every day more
than common.
TABES DORSALIS, or CONSUMPTION £F the BACK.
A YOUNG gentleman, twenty-two yea*rs of age, applied to me in the above
diforder, which had worn him down to a mere fkeleton. The tabes is feldom dif-
tinguiflied by any remarkable fever, cough, or difficulty of breathing ; but is attend-
ed with want of appetite, a weak digeftion, and a morbid Rate of the blood, whence
the body grows languid, and waftes by degrees. Sometimes this fpecies of con-
fumption is brought on by a venereal ulcer ;
but it moft commonly proceeds from
exceftive evacuations of the femen, which was the cafe with this patient. He had
too early addi6ted himfelf to an intercourfe with lewd women, which eventually
brought on an involuntary fhedding of the feed, which came from him on the leaft
exertion, whether of walking, riding, lifting a weight, or even of pulling off his
clothes.—I ordered him a ftrong nutritious diet, with a table-fpoonful of the Solar
Tin&ure four times a-day, in the fame quantity of warm water, which he purfued
for a month. He found his ftrength was fo much recovered, that I could fafely
advife moderate exercife both on horfeback and on foot. The gleet, however, was
uncommonly obftinate ;
and the Tin6ture was continued for the fecond month in
the fame quantity. By this time the parts were eonfiderably braced ; he could run
or jump without perceiving the fmalleft emiffion ;
and the healthful colour of his
cheek
l
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 363
cheelc began to return.—He now perfifted in the Tindture, only three times a-day,
for a month longer ;
after which the dofe was reduced to night and morning for
another month ;
he then took it twice a-day for two months more, at the end of
which period every lymptom of the complaint was removed, he had fully recovered
his fleih and ftrength ;
and now preferves it by taking the Solar Tincture as a
beverage, made after the manner of brandy and water. This diforder has in gene-
ral been deemed incurable. It is true, that even in its early attacks, it is fo effen-
tially ncceffary to abftain from venereal embraces, that, without it, the belt remedies
will prove altogether ufelefs ; hence the tabes dorfalis fo often proves mortal', be-
caufe the patient has feidom refolution enough to difpenfe with his amours.
RHEUMATIC GOUT.
THIS difeafe is generally brought on by alternate heats and colds in the blood,
whereby a humour is produced which attacks the joints and mufcles, fometimes
accompanied with difcolorations and fwellings, and at othef times without either;
but it is always attended with excruciating pain. Mr. John Brandham, of Brid-
lington Quay, was attacked in this manner; when, after fometime, the fevere pain
of his joints, falling into his legs and thighs, deprived him of the ufe of his limbs,
and confined him entirely to his bed. He was foon after feized with a violent pain
in his head and flomach, which fo much affedted his refpiration, that inftant death
was expedted. In this extremity, half a wine-glafs of the Solar Tindture was ad-
miniftered, undiluted,
which removed the danger, and gave his flomach immediate
eafe. A table fpoonful, in the fame quantity of warm water, wa3 then given every
third hour during the fucceeding day and night, by which the pains were con-
fiderably abated. He continued the medicine four times a-day for a month longer
;
at the expiration of which time he experienced a perfedt cure, and has never fince
found the fmallefl return of his complaint ; of which he is defirous of fatisfying
any enquirer, who choofes to apply for that purpofe.
AGUES, CONVULSIONS, CHOLIC, BLOODY-FLUX, and violent
SPASMS in the STOMACH and BOWELS.
DURING the fit, let one or two table-fpoonfuls of the Solar Tindture, undiluted,
be adminiflered fucceffively, as the extremity of the cafe may require ;
and after-
wards let the patient continue the medicine, night and morning, in the quantity
of a table-fpoonful in a wine-glafs of warm water, or oftener, as the obftinacy of
the cafe may render neceffary, and in a very fhort time a perfedt cure will be ex^
perienced ;
a few inftances of which I fhall add, in the words of thofe who have
tranfmitted me the fadts.

DISEASES of the BREAST and LUNGS, ASTHMA, DROPSY, or

TAKE one fpoonfuLof the TinCture, night and morning, for twenty days fuc-
ceffively, diluted in two fpoonfuls of cold fpring-water; then reduce it to the fame
dofe every other day, which will in general remove the malady in the courfe of a
month; but, if the dropfy or confumption have been far advanced, it will be necef-
fary to continue the medicine for one, two, or even three, months longer, reducing
the number of dofes in proportion as health and ftrength appear to return, and as
the blood fhall have refumed its proper confiftency, and a brilker circulation. In
thefe complaints, it will not be amifs to take the Tincture in a tumbler of warm
water, as a beverage, for fome time after the cure is perfected, as it will infallibly
prevent the blood from returning to its watery and impoverilhed Rate, and will
rarefy and expel the vifcid cohefions in the pulmonary veflels. In thefe diforders,
the Solar TinCture may be fafely admiftered to females even during obflruCtions
of the catamenia, as hath lately been experienced by perfecting an admirable cure
on a lady in Grafton-ftreet.
This lady was afflicted with obflruCtions of the liver and fpleen, infomuch that
the could not walk up one pair of flairs without much pain, and fhortnefs of breath*
Her menfes were obftruCted ;
and twice or thrice a-day the was attacked with afth-
matic fpafms, accompanied with febrile fymptoms. This affliction being of a pecu-
liar nature, I was obliged to prefcribe both the Solar and Lunar TinCtures, in the
following manner : Whenever the fever came on, fhe took a dofe of the Solar Tinc-
ture; and every morning and evening, fixty drops of the Lunar TinCture in a gilL
of mugwort tea ;
and in twenty-one days the was perfectly recovered, and reftored
to her ufual colour and vivacity, to the great joy of her parents and friends.
MENTAL DEPRESSION, or LOWNESS of SPIRITS.
THIS may be confidered the primary diforder of the nervous train ;
and, if refitted
in time, may in moft cafes be ealily cured. For this purpofe take a table-fpoonful
of the Solar TinCture, diluted in a wine-glafs of cold fpring-water, every forenoon
at eleven or twelve o’clock, for fourteen fuccefiive days; then ufe it in every two or
three days for a month ,
and the complaint will be entirely removed, as all patients
will fenfibly feel, by their alertnefs, activity, and unufual flow of natural fpirits;
of which the following cafe may ferve as an example :

BILE on the STOMACH.
ALL bilious complaints are removed by the Solar Tin&ure in a moll extraor-
dinary manner. Whenever a fit appears to be coming on, with the ftomach
loaded and oppreffed, one large table-fpoonful, taken in the fame quantity of
warm water, will in ten minutes carry off the offending matter, cleanfe and comfort
the digeftive organs, and give the patient immediate relief.
BITE of a MAD DOG, or any VENOMOUS REPTILE.
THE fatal difeafe confequent on the bite of a mad dog, is the hydrophobia, or
“ dread of w ater which circumftance firft fuggefted dipping in the fea for cure.
It is very remarkable that thefe patients have not only a dread of water, but of every
thing bright or tranfparent. Soon after this affe6tion takes place, the mind be-
comes impaired ;
which fhows that the poifon is carried through the blood to the
nervous fluid, and thence to the brain. Dr. James, in his Treatife on Canine Mad-
nefs, mentions a boy fent out to fill two bottles with water, who was fo terrified by
the noife of the liquid running into them, that he fled into the houfe crying out
that he was bewitched. He mentions alfo the cafe of a farmer, who, going to draw
fome ale from a cafk, was terrified to fuch a degree at its running into the veffel,
that he ran out in great hafte with the fpigot in his hand. But, in whatever manner
this fymptom comes on, it is certain that the moll painful fenfatidns accompany
every attempt to fwallow liquids. Nay, the bare fight of water, of a looking-glafs,
of any thing clear or pellucid, will give the utmoft uneafinefs, or even throw the
patient into convulfions. In this difeafe there feems to be an extreme fenfibility
and irritability of the nervous fyftem. The eyes cannot bear the light, nor the fight
of any thing w hite ;
the leaf; touch or motion offends them, and they want to be
kept as quiet and in as dark a place as poffible. Some complain of the coldnefs of
the air, frequently when it is really warm. Others complain of violent heat ;
and
have a great defire for cold air, which yet never fails to increafe the fymptoms. In
all there is a great flow of the faliva into the mouth; which is exceedingly trouble-
fome to the patients, as it has the fame effect upon their fauces that other liquids
7 have.
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 367
have. This therefore they perpetually blow off with violence, which in a patient
of Dr. Fothergill’s occafioned a noife not unlike the hollow barking of a dog, and
which he conjectures might have given rife to the common notion that hydrophobi-
ous patients bark like dogs. They have an infatiable third; but are unable to get
down any drink, except with the utmoft difficulty; though fometimes they can
fwallow bread foaked in liquids, dices of orange, or other fruits. There is a pain
under the fcrobiculus cordis, as in the tetanus ;
and the patients mournfully point
to. that place as the feat of the difeafe. Dr. Vaughan is of opinion that it is this pair,
rather than any difficulty in fwallowing, which diftreffes the patient on every at-
tempt to drink. The voice is commonly plaintive and mournful; but Dr. Vaughan
tells us there is a mixture of fiercenefs and timidity in the countenance which he
cannot defcribe, but by which he could know a hydrophobious perfon without afk-
ing any queftions. Some feem to have at times a furious delirium, and an inclina-
tion to fpit at or bite the by-ftanders ;
while others fhow no fuch inclination, but
will even fuffer people to wipe the infide of their mouths with the corner of a hand-
kerchief in order to clear away the vifcid faliva which is ready to fuffocate them.
In fome male patients there is an involuntary ereCtion of the penis, and emifiion of
the femen; and the urine is forced away by the frequent return of the fpafms.
In a letter from Dr. Wolf, of Warfaw, to Henry Baker, F. R. S. dated Warfaw',
Sept. 26th, 1767, we have the following melancholy account of the cafes of five
perfons who died of the hydrophobia : None of them quite loft their fehfes; but they
were all talking without intermiffion, praying, lamenting, defpairing, curling, figh-
ing, fpitting a frothy faliva, fcreeching, fometimes belching, and retching, but rare-
ly vomiting. Every member is convulfed by fits, but moft violently from the na-
vel up to the breaft and cefophagus. The fit comes on every quarter of an hour;
the fauces are not red, nor the tongue dry. The pulfe is not at all feverifli ; and,
when the fit is over, nearly like a found pulfe. The face grows pale, then brown,
and during the fit almoft black; the lips livid ; the head is drowfy, and the ears
tingling; the urine limpid. Atlaft they grow weary; the fits are lefs violent, and
h ceafe towards the end ;
the pulfe becomes weak, intermittent, and not very quick ;
they fweat, and at laft the whole body becomes cold. They compofe themfelves
quietly as if to get deep, and fo they expire. A general obfervation was, that the
lint and dreflings of the wounds, even when dry, were always black, and that when
the pus was very good in colour and appearance. In one of Dr. Wolfs patients
who recovered, the blood ftank intolerably as it was drawn from a vein ; and one
of Mr. Vaughan’s patients complained of an intolerable foetid fmell proceeding
from the wounded part, though nobody but himfelf could perceive it. In general,
the violent convulfious ceafe a ffiort time before death ; and even the hydrophobia
goes
338 A KEY TO PHYSIC
goes off, fo that the patients can drink freely. But this does not always happen;
for Mr. Vaughan mentions the cafe of a patient, in whom, “ when he had in ap-
pearance ceafed to breathe, the fpafmus cynicus was obfervable, with an odd con-
vulfive motion in the mufcles of the face ;
and the ftrange contrariety which took
place in the adtion of thefe produced the moft horrid affemblage of features that
can well be conceived. Of this patient alfo it was remarkable, that in the lafl
hours of his life he ceafed to call for drink, which had been his conftant requeft ;
but was perpetually afking for fomething to eat.”
The hydrophobia feems to be a fymptom peculiar to the human race; for the
mad animals which communicate the infedtion do not feem to have any dread of
water. Notwithftanding this, dipping is the common remedy for the cure of dogs
and men. With regard to the fymptoms of madnefs in dogs, they are very equivocal;
and thofe particularly enumerated by fome authors, are Only fuch as might be ex-
pected in dogs much heated or agitated by being violently purfued and ftruck.
One fymptom indeed, if it could be depended upon, would determine the matter
;
namely, that all other dogs avoid and run away from one that is mad ;
and even
large dogs will not attack one of the fmalleft fize who is infedted with this difeafe.
Upon this fuppofition they point out a method of difcovering whether a dog, who
hath been killed, was really mad or not ;
namely, by rubbing a piece of meat
along the infide of his mouth, and then offering it to a found dog. If the latter eats
it, it is afign the dog was not mad ;
but, if the other rejedts it with a kind of howl-
ing noife, it is certain that he was. Dr. James tell us, that among dogs the difeafe
is infedtious by flaying in the fame place ;
and that, after a kennel has been once in-
fedted, the dogs put into it will be for* a confiderable time afterwards in danger ©f
going mad alfo. A remedy for this, he fays, is, to keep geefe for fome time in the
kennel. He rejedts as falfe the opinion that dogs when going mad will not bark
;
though he owns that there is a very confiderable change in their bark, which be-
comes hoarle and hollow.
With regard to the immediate caufe;among mankind, there is not the leaft doubt
that the hydrophobia is occafioned by the faliva of the mad animal being mixed
with the blood. It does not appear that this can operate through the cuticula ;
but,,
when that is rubbed off, the fmalleft quantity is fufficient to communicate the dif-
eafe, and a flight fcratch with the teeth of a mad animal has been found as perni-
cious as a large wound. It is certain alfo, that the infedtion has been communicated
by the bites of dogs, cats, wolves, foxes, weafels, fwine, and even cocks and hens,
when in a flate of madnefs. But it does not appear that the diftemper is communi-
cable from one hydrophobious perfon to another, by means of the bite, or any
other w'ay.
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 369
It has been generally allowed by practitioners, that, though the hydrophobia may
be prevented, yet it can feldom he cured after the dileafe has made its appearance.
The moil eflential part of the treatment therefore depends on an immediate ufe of
the proper means of prevention. For this purpofe fome advife the inftant cutting
out the part bitten, which muft certainly be an effectual mode, provided we could
be fure the poifon had not reached beyond the wound. When, however, we con-
fider the rapidity with which the blood and juices flow, it feems impoffible we can
ever wholly depend on fuch an operation. I fhould neverthelefs advife it to be
done; after which let the part be well foaked with the Solar TinCture; and, to fortify
the blood, let the patient immediately fwallow a table fpoonful every three hours,
undiluted,
for the firft day; and the fame dofe night and morning, for a month fol-
lowing. Let the part be again foaked with the TinCture four times a-day, for three
or four days; and I am fatisfied a fafe and perfeCt cure may be relied on. For the
bite of adders, fnakes, &c. bathing the part, and taking the medicine undiluted, will
counteract the virulence of the poifon, and preferve the patient from further injury.
For GUN-SHOT WOUNDS, CUTS, STABS, &c.
GENTLEMEN in the army and navy, and all perfons liable to gun-fhots, {tabs,
wounds, &c. fliould never be without the Solar TinCture. Its falutary effeCts on
the blood, in all thefe cafes, are really furprifing. It totally prevents, and will even
{top, mortification, in very advanced ftages. It quickly fupplies the greateft lofs of
blood ; fortifies the heart, cherifhes the vital organs, and heals and unites the flefli
in an uncommon degree. If taken internally, and poured at the fame time into the
wound, it is quickly propelled through the heart by the veins and arteries ;
and
thus renovates the exhaufted fpirits, and preferves life. Its effeCt on a few Ample
wounds may be feen in the following cafes.
To E. SIBLY, M. D.
SIR,—For the fake of thofe liable to accidents, I think it right to inform you
of a moll remarkable cure performed by your Solar TinCture, on a very deep and
dangerous wound made on Mrs. Cook by a cafe-knife, of more than the depth of
my fore-finger. After trying every means in vain to flop the blood, I fent for a
bottle of your Solar TinCture, and well bathed the wound therewith. The blood
and TinCture readily aflimilated, and formed a cruft on the orifice of the w ound,
which very loon ftopped the effufion of blood. But what is moft remarkable, the
wound was completely healed in lefsthan fix days, and is now fo perfectly clofed,
as to be almoft imperceptible. You are welcome to publifli this, and in fo doing
will oblige, &c.

To E. SIBLY, M. D.
SIR,—In juftice to my own feelings, I cannot but acquaint you with a cure per-
formed by your Solar Tin6ture, in a very uncommon manner. As I was travelling
in the ftage to Boxley-Abbey, near Maidftone, in Kent, a gentleman, who fat next
me, putting his head out of the window, received a violent cut acrofs the eye wdth the
coachman’s whip, which produced an immediate fwelling and inflammation, attend-
ed wdth fo much agony, that he declared the pain was infupportable. I had pur-
chafed a bottle of your Solar Tinfture while in town, knowing it had performed
many furprifing cures in my neighbourhood. This I immediately opened, and ap-
plied to the inflamed part; and, after walhing the eye well with it, I bound a white
handkerchief tight over it, wetted with the Tinfiture. In lefs than ten minutes the
anguifh was greatly afluaged ;
and in the courfe of three hours it was quite well.
The gentleman expreflfed the utmoft aftonilhment at the celerity of the cure, as did
every paffenger in the coach. I with this to be made as public as poflible, for the
benefit of thofe w ho are liable to accidents ;
and am with refpedt, &c.
M. STABLES.
I lhall only remark further, with refpe6t to wounds, bruifes, &c. that a fhorttime
ago, as a coach was driving furioully out of Cavendilh-fquare, the horfes unfortu-
nately beat down a girl of eight years of age, the daughter of Robert and Elizabeth
Larken, of Clipfton-ftreet; and, the wheels palling over her body, Ihe was taken up
to all appearance dead. The fpe&ators were for carrying her immediately to the
hofpital ; but, the accident happening very near my houfe, I was fent for. I avoid-
ed letting blood, but bathed the bruifed parts thoroughly with the Solar Tin6ture,
and introduced half a fpoonful, undiluted, into her ftomach. It was now about nine
o’clock at night. She was compofed and afleep before ten, being overcome by
the medicine. A fpoonful more of the Tincture was given her at different periods
of the night, the fudorific power of which brought on a plentiful perfpiration „ At
ten o’clock the next morning Ihe awoke, and got up, and was fo well recovered as
to be able to play about with her companion?, in all refpe&s the fame as if nothing
had happened. The girl, and her parents, are pleafed with every opportunity of
recounting the circumftances of this event, to any enquirers.
Let it not be faid, that, becaufe this medicine appears to be preferibed for many
diforders, it can be good for none.—I affirm, that every complaint for which it is re-
commended, originates in the blood, or in obJlruBed perfpiration. The action of the
Solar Tincture is on the blood and juices; it ftrikes at the root, not at the
branches; by which peculiar advantage it effects a cure when other medicines fail.
And, though there is a medicine, fold in regular pra&ice at a guinea an ounce,

which pofteffes no one virtue comparable to the Solar Tinfilure; yet the proprietor,
unwilling to adopt fuch examples, or to withhold from the afflicted in every line of
of life the benefits of his difcovery, has determined to render it to the public at only
7s. fid. the fmall, and 13s. the large, bottles, duty included, with ample directions
in every complaint for which it ought to be adminifter^d.—A fingle bottle will in
many cafes perform a fpeedy cure, when, in the ordinary courfe of medical practice,
it would occupy a month, and colt many pounds for unneceflary attendance, and
excefs of drugs.
OF THE
PRINCIPLES
/
OF
LIFE AND DEATH.
LIFE denotes the animated (late of nature ;
and, in human beings, exifts as long as
an union of the foul and body lafts. With us, therefore, life continues, until fuch fe-
paration has really taken place; which can no more be faid to have happened dur-
ing the paroxifm of a fit, or of a blow which for a time deprives us of fenfation, or
in the early period of an unnatural or fudden death, than during the time we are
afleep. It is the want of proper lkill at fuch times that too often occafions death
to take place, when life abfolutely exifts in the blood, and might with little care
have been preferved. Death is therefore the a6t of feparation of the foul from the
body ;
in which fenfe it ftands oppofed to life, which confifts in the union thereof.
An animal body, by the a&ions infeparable from life, undergoes a continual change,
and receives its diffolution by degrees. Its fmalleft fibres become rigid ;
its minuter
veflels
372 A KEY TO PHYSIC
veflels grow into folid fibres no longer pervious to the fluids ;
its greater veflels
grow hard and narrow; and every thing becomes contracted, clofed, and bound up:
whence the drynefs, immobility, and extenuation, obferved in old age. By luch
means the offices of the minuter veflels are deftroyed; the huirfours ftagnate, har-
den, and at length coalefce with the folids. Thus are the fubtileft fluids in the
body intercepted and loft, the concoCtion weakened, and the reparation prevented ;
only the blood continues to run flowly through the greater veflels, afliduous to pre-
ferve life, even after the animal functions are deftroyed. At length, in the procefs
of thefe changes, death becomes inevitable, as the neceffary confequences of life,
But it is rare indeed that life is thus long protradted, or that death fucceeds merely
from the natural decays and impairment of old age. Accidental difeafes, and our
negleCt of preferving health, cut the work fliort.
The figns of death are often very uncertain. If we confult what Window or
Bruchier have faid on this fubjeCt, we lliall be convinced, that between life and
death the ftiade is fo very undiftinguifhable, that even all the powers of art can
fcarcely determine where the one ends and the other begins. The colour of the
vifage, the warmth of the body, and fupplenefs of the joints, are but uncertain figns
of life ftill fubfifting; while, on the contrary, the palenefs of the complexion, the
coldnefs of the body, the ftiffnefs of the extremities, the ceflation of all motion, and
the total infenfibility of the parts, are but uncertain marks of death begun. In the
fame manner all'o, wuth regard to the pulfe and breathing; thefe motions arefo often
kept under, that it is impoflible to perceive them. By bringing a looking-glafs
near to the mouth of the perfon fuppofed to be dead, people often expeCt to find
whether he breathes or not. But this is a very uncertain experiment: the glafs is
frequently fullied by the vapour of the dead man’s body ;
and often the perfon is
ftill alive, though the glafs is no way tarniftied. In the fame manner, neither noifes
in the ears, nor pungent fpirits applied to the noftrils, give certain figns of thedif-
continuance of life; and there are many inftances of perfons who have endured
them all, and afterwards recovered without any external afliftance, to the aftonifh-
ment of the fpe6tators. This furely ought to be a caution againft hafty burials,- ef-
pecially in cafes of fudden death ; for it is fhocking to reflect, that fome hundreds
of valuable members of fociety are annually torn from their difconfolate families by
fome accidental fudden caufe, and hurried thoughtlefsly to the grave, in whom the
principles of life were capable of being revived ! This lamentable truth has been
eftablilhed by the happy fuccefs of the Humane Society, from whofe laudable exer-
tions feveral hundred perfons have been reftored to life, who, to all vifible appear-
ance, were pajl recovery. Every age and country affords fome inftances of perfons
having been recovered, even alter lying long for dead ;
and from the number of
7 thofe
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 373
thofe preferved by mere lucky.accidents, it is evident ftill greater numbers might be
faved by timely pains and {kill. Thofe who have contemplated the ftru6ture of the
human machine know, that its diffolution cannot naturally happen but by that gra-
dual decay of the whole fyftem above defcribed, when the veffels are become imper-
vious to the fluids, the circulation weakened or deftroyed, and the vital organs no
longer able to perform their office. But, when their fun&ions are merely fufpend-
ed by fome fudden {hock, it may be likened to the date of a watch flopped by a fall,
which refumes its motion the inftant that injury is repaired. In the animal ceconomy,
“ the BLOOD is the LIFE Levit. xvii. 11, 14. Deut. xii. 23. therefore, if its
circulation be fufpended or deftroyed, death follows. But, if the blood can be
re-agitated, and its circulation refumed, life will of neceffity be reftored. For this
reafon, whenever any accident has happened, by which fudden death appears to
have taken place, whether by blows, fits, falls, fuffocation, ftrangulation, drowning,
apoplexy, convulfion-fits, thunder and lightning, affaffination, duelling, or the like,
let the unfortunate perfon be carried into a warm houfe, and laid by the fire, or put
into a warm bed ;
let two or three table-fpoonfuls of the Solar Tindlure be intro-
duced as early as poffible into the ftomach, and rubbed profufely in, by a warm
hand, upon the fpine of the back, loins, breaft, and region of the heart, and poured
into the wound, if there be any; the warm ftimulating quality of the medicine, af-
fifted by the external heat and fri&ion, will quickly roufe the ftagnant blood and
juices, particularly in the grand refervoir the heart, where, rarefying, preffing every
way, and being refilled by the valves, it will fwell fo as to fill the flaccid right auri-
cle of the heart, which by the lhock had become empty and at reft ;
and thus, fti-
naulating its fibres, will put them in motion. The right auricle being thus filled,
and ftimulated into contra6lion, fills the ventricle; which, by this means being irri-
tated, likewife contracts and empties itfelf into the pulmonary artery ; and, the mo-
ment this is done, the circulation begins again where it left off; and the lungs, being
filled by the dephlogifticated air contained in the medicine, begin to a<5t, and life is
reftored, provided the organs and juices are in a fit difpofition for it; which they
undoubtedly are much oftener than is imagined. Nor is this ftimulating action of
the Tin&ure upon the heart at all furprifing; for every medical man knows, or ought
to know, that the heart, even when taken out of the body, if it be pricked with a
pin, or hath warm water thrown upon it, will beat afrefli, and endeavour to exert its
fun£tions, though for fome time before it had been motionlefs. No perfon there-
fore ought to be confidered dead, until the energy of the blood is fo far gone, that
it can never again be agitated fo as to fill and ftimulate into contra<5lion the right
Jinus venofus and auricle of the heart.

When the patient is thus far recovered, he ought to be treated with great care and
tendernefs ;
and fome warm milk, wine and water, elder-flower-tea, or any nourifh-
ing fpoon-meat, fhould be given to him as foon as he appears capable of taking
food. In fome cafes it may be neceffary to open the temporal artery and the exter-
nal jugular, or to bleed in the arm; but this fhould never be done, if it can fafely
be difpenfed with, as it certainly weakens the animal principle, which it is the firft
objeCl of this medicine to ftrengthen. Under different circumftances, and as parti-
cular occafions may require, the rules laid down in p. 196 of the Medical Part of
this work, and recommended by the Humane Society, will be found of confiderable
advantage. Above all, let me entreat an anxious perfeverance in this fublimeftof
all virtues—the attempt to recover perifhing lives. Humanity calls for it in the
moft moving accents; and what can infpire a good heart with more fincere, per-
fect, confcientious, and commendable, fatisfa&ion, than a retrofpeCl of fuch endea-
vours as have been generoufly exerted and fuccefstully contributed to recover, per-
haps to reftore, the life of a fellow-creature from the moft deprecated calamity
—
fudden death, with its alarming retinue of threatening confequences to thofe who
die unprepared? iince, by thus preferving a finner to a future period, perhaps a foul
may emerge in full maturity to felicity which ihall have no end !
To demonftratethe reanimating pow er of the medicine, experiments may be made
upon a fowl, lamb, cat, dog, or other animal, by plunging them under w'ater until
they are apparently dead, or piercing them through the head, or any part of the bo-
dy except the heart; by fuffocation, or an electrical ihock : for fudden death, how-
foever it happens, whether by drowning or otherwife, is much the fame as to its ef-
fects on the vital organs; confequently they are all to be treated in a fimilar manner.
Upon the whole it is evident, that by contemplating the oeconomy and harmony
of our ftruCture, both external and internal, we may quickly difeern a proper line
of conduCt for the confervation of health, and the prolongation of life; and we fhall
alfo perceive a more augult view of the marvellous works of divine wifdom in the
ftruCture of the human frame, than we fhall perhaps again find in the whole com-
pafs of nature. The gift of health was evidently the defign of our benevolent
Creator in the conftruCtion of our bodies; it is therefore no lefs our duty than our
intereft to preferve this bleffing to our lateft moments, as the feafoning and fund
which gives the relifh to all our other enjoyments. To enumerate the various
abufes of health, which take place from our earlieft infancy, particularly among the
rich and gay, and which are continued through the fucceeding ftages of modifh
life, would fill a volume. Suffice it to obferve, that they prevail more particularly
among people who are the moft highly polilhed and refined. To compare their
artificial mode of living with that of nature, would afford a very ftriking contrail,
7 and
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 375
and fupply an obvious reafon why perfons in the lower orders of fociety are gene-
rally the longed livers, and enjoy the beft Hate of health; and hence we are war-
ranted to conclude, that a large proportion of the difeafes to which we are fubje&ed
are produced by ourfelves.
Notwithftanding this unaccountable abufe of our health, yet the want of it unfits
us for moll of the common avocations of life, and is more efpecially an enemy to
the focial and humane affe&ions, as it generally renders the unhappy fufferer peevifii
and fullen, difgufted at the allotments of Providence, and apt to induce fuicide, by
fuggefting gloomy and fufpicious fentiments of the Almighty. It obltru6ls the
free exercife and full improvement of our reafon, makes us a burden to our friends,
and ufelefs to fociety. Whereas the uninterrupted enjoyment of health is a con-
ftant fource of good humour, and good humour is a great friend to opennefs and
benignity of heart; enables us to encounter the various ills and difappointments of
this world with more courage, or to fuftuin them with more patience; and, in Ihort,
conduces much, if we are otherwife duly qualified, to our acting our part in every
exigency of life with more firmnefs, confiftency, and dignity. Therefore it imports
us much to preferve and improve the habit of its enjoyment, without which every
other external entertainment is taftelefs, and moll other advantages are of little avail.
To this end, we ought above all things to cultivate prudence, temperance, fobriety, -
fortitude, and equanimity of temper ;
for without a prudent care of the body, and
a Heady government of the mind, to guard the one from difeafe, and the other
from the feuds of paffion and prejudice, found health is unattainable. By temper-
ance we enjoy the real gratifications of life, without fullering any confequent incon-
venience. Sobriety enables us to be content with limple and frugal fare, and pro-
te6ls us from the pain and difgrace of intoxication. Fortitude enables us to bear
thofe infirmities which prudence and fobriety cannot Ihun, and banilhes all dread of
imaginary evils from our thoughts. Equanimity of temper contributes greatly to
the happinefs of life, as well as to the prefervation of health, by keeping the mind
from anxiety and perturbation, and arming us againll the calumnies and animofities
of human nature. Violent paffions, and the exceffes they induce, gradually impair
and wear away the conllitution ;
whilll the calm and placid Hate of a temperate
mind, and the healthful exercife of the body, preferve the natural fun6lions in full
vigour and harmony, and exhilarate the fpirits, which are the chief inllruments of ac-
tion. The worll confequences that could poffibly refult from a llrift adherence to
this regimen, would be that of exterminating a fw'arm of loculls, and rendering the
difcovery of my medicine of lefs importance to the community.

373 A KEY TO PHYSIC
Of the CRISIS, or CRITICAL TURN, or a DISEASE.
THE Crifis of a Difeafe is no other than the ftruggle betwixt nature and the
infirmity, which of them fhall prevail. If nature at the time of the crifis over-
comes the malignity of the difeafe, it is a fure fign it will be cured; but, if the fick-
nefs prevails, it is then a pernicious crifis, and ftiows fudden alterations for the worfe^
Every fudden and vehement motion of the difeafe may be called a crifis ; therefore
days critical, decretory, and crifmal, are all one and the fame thing, and import
no more tlian a certain and more fure judgment of the infirmity afflidting, either
more powerful, or lefs vehement, at thofe times when the true crifis happens
;
therefore a crifis is to be calculated from that moment of time when the difeafe
firft invaded the patient. And on this ground I fhall make fome obfervations to
prove the truth of what I have now to deliver, and of what I have before fo often
proved, that I cannot but admire the wonderful providence of God, who difpofeth
all things by number, weight, and meafure, prefcribeth to the whole fyftem of na-
ture fo immutable a law, that it were as eafy for the heaven and the earth to return
to their original chaos, as to break and infringe that immutable law, unlefs the di-
vine will and pleafure alter it miraculoufly.
We difcriminate two forts of difeafes; acute, and chronic. Of acute difeafes
fome are Amply acute, others peracute, that is very acute; others again are perper-
acute, or exceedingly acute. Thofe that are fimply acute are finilhed in eight, ten,
eleven, fourteen, twenty, or twenty~one, days. They are terminated in the time
the Moon traceth the twelve celeftial figns of the zodiac, viz. in tvrenty-feven
days and eight hours.
Thofe acute difeafes which fuffer changes are very fickle; for fometimes they in-
creafe, and fometimes they are remitted, according as the Moon meets with the
beams of either benefic or baneful planets ;
and fometimes they change out of
acute difeafes into chronic ; and thus a continued fever may change into an hediic
fever, or an intermittant fever into a continual fever; and thefe difeafes terminate
in forty days.
Very acute difeafes are fuch as terminate in five, fix, feven, or eight, days;
amongfl which is the difeafe called peripneumonia, or inflammation of the lungs.
Exceedingly acute difeafes are fuch as end in three or four days at fartheft, as pef-
tilences, apoplexies, &c.
Chronic difeafes follow the motion of the Sun, and it is about ninety days before
the firft crifis begins to appear; for in that time the Sun comes to the proper quar-
tile of the place he was in at the decumbiture; as appears in hedtic fevers, dropfies,
and the like. But, when he comes to thofe degrees from the decumbiture which
are
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 377
are called indicative, or intercidental, which are both one, or judicial, (as may be
feen in the Table,) fome alteration will appear, whereby a man may judge of the
crifis to come. For the patient will be well, if the Sun be well configurated with
benign planets; but vvorfe, if in afpedt with evil ones; and this rule is infallible, if
you confider it from the nativity throughout the whole courfe of a man’s life; for
difeafes are the particular attendants of the inequality of the elements in every human
being.
Alfo a crifis may be perfe6l, or imperfeft. A perfect crifis is when the difeafe
appears plain, and pcrfedlly to be judged of; and this is fometimes hopeful, and
fometimes defperate. Hopeful, when there is a great probability of health and re-
covery; defperate, when there are palpable fig ns of death. An iinperfe6t crifis is
when the difeafe is changed upon every light occafion ;
as if Mars be the author of
the difeafe, and in a double-bodied fign ;
in this cafe the difeafe will be variable.
That crifis may be deemed fafe, which comes without pernicious afpe&s; but
that is doubtful and dangerous which comes with malignant afpedts ;
what thefe
afpe6ts are, with the fignificators of every difeafe, and the mode of afcertaining
them, are already explained in my Illustration of Astrology. I have there
fhown, that to judge of a difeafe, it is neceffary to obferve the motion of the Sun,
Moon, and lord of the afcendant. With refped to the lord of the afcendant,
obferve, before you give judgment, what application he makes to any planet, either
by conjunction, quartile, or oppofition; or, fhould he apply to more than one planet,
look to which of them he approaches neareft, and then count how many degrees of
longitude are between them; and, if the difeafe be acute, then for every degree add
a day; but, if chronic, a week, month, or year, according to the fituation of Jupi-
ter, Venus, Mercury, or the Moon, at a perfect crifis.
Now the time called critical is always evil, becaufe of the contrariety of the fign
the Moon is then in to the fign the was in at the decumbiture, which induceth the
contrariety of her nature to the oppofite place ;
therefore at fuch a time there arifeth
a controverfy and conteft between the difeafe and nature. The Moon upholds na-
ture in acute difeafes ;
and hence is the reafon that a bad crifis will always happen,
if lhe be affli&ed upon a critical day by the bodies or evil beams of Saturn or Mars,
or by the lord of the eighth houfe, or by the lord of the fourth houfe, if he be a ma-
levolent, becaufe he fignifies the grave. But, if the Moon at the time of the crifis
behold the lord of the afcendant, or be configurated with the benefic planets, health
enfues, and the malady will be vanquifhed and overcome in the confli61.
If the difeafe terminates not upon the firft crifis, obferve how the Moon will be
configurated on the fecond crifis, and judge by the fame rules. If it terminates
net then, as will fometimes happen, view the third crifis, and judge by that the fame
No. 24. 5 D way.
378 A KEY TO PHYSIC
way. If your judgment, fupported by reafon and the former rules, declare that
the difeafe will not terminate one way or other, neither in health nor death ;
then
examine the face of the heavens at the time the Moon returns to the place die was
in at the decumbiture, which is at the end of twenty-feven days, eight hours, and
fome minutes ;
and judge according as the Moon fiiall be then configurated with
benefic or malignant planets ;
for this of neceffity terminates all acute difeafes
;
though we may obferve that not one in a hundred holds on fo long, nor one out of
twenty continues half fo long.
If the acute difeafe ends not in a month, it is then turned into a chronic difeafe;
and muft be judged of by the Sun. The rules forjudging chronic difeafes by the
Sun are fimilar to thofe by which we judge of acute difeafes by the Moon. Now,
for the right diftin&ion and calculation of time to judge of the progrefs of a difeafe
in this way, obferve the following method : See what degree the Moon was in at the
decumbiture, by an Ephemeris, and add twenty-two degrees thirty minutes, which
is called the indicative time, becaufe it informs the ph'yfician the nature of the dif-
eafe; for upon thefe indicative days the difeafe is ufually remitted and mitigated.
To this indicative time add twenty-two degrees thirty minutes more, and this
points out the judicial day, viz. juft forty-five degrees from the place of the Moon
when the patient fell fick, being the half of a crifis, and manifefts, according as the
Moon happens to be afpedted, whether a good or a bad crifis will enfue. To the
judicial day add twenty-two degrees thirty minutes more, and it makes fixty-feven
degrees thirty minutes, which produces the fecond indicative day, as falling be-
tween the crifis and judicial day. From this the phyfician may expert indications
how the difeafe will finally fhow itfelf. To this add twenty-two degrees thirty mi-
nutes more, and you have the perfedt crifis of the difeafe from the decumbiture,
viz. ninety degrees, or one quarter of the zodiac. At this time nature will mani-
feft, according to the planets that are in afpedt to the Moon, whether the lick per-
fon will have a good or bad crifis; and, adding twenty-two degrees thirty minutes
more, it makes the next judicial day, when the Moon approacheth to it; and foon,
through the whole twelve figns of the zodiac, and over it again, if the difeafe termi-
nate not in that time, as will plainly appear by the following Table, which fhows
when the Moon comes to an indicative or to a judicial day/ that is, a femiquartile,
or half a crifis ;
and when to a true quartile, and when to an oppofition, which is
called a full crifis ;
and fo to all the indicative and judicial days during the fick-
nefs, See.
EXAMPLE.
Suppofe the true place of the Moon, at the time a perfon falls fick, be fixteen
degrees of Gemini, w’hich will be found in the fourth column of the following Ta-

ble, fo that fixteen degrees of Gemini will be the Moon’s radical place in the de-
cumbiture. Over againft 16 degrees, to the right hand, I find S 30, and over
the head thereof I find s>; fo that, when the Moon came to eight degrees thirty
minutes of Cancer, it was the firft indicative day, wherein the phyfician might
expedt to fee how the difeafe would fhow itfelf. Upon every crifis or indicative
day, make fpecial obfervation what planet the Moon is in configuration with ;
if
with a benevolent planet, expedt fome rem'iffnefs in the difeafe ;
but, if with a ma-
levolent, the contrary effedt will follow'. Next, on the right hand to 8 30 of
you will find 1 ft, which fliows that, when the Moon comes to the firft degree of
Leo, fhe will be in femiquartile to her firft place; and this is, as before ftated, half
a crifis, at which time the difeafe will more or lefs manifeft itfelf according to fuch
configurations as the Moon is found to make with the other planets at the time flie
comes to the firft degree of Leo. In the next column on the right hand, you fee
23 30, and over it &. This points out the indicative day, wherein the phyfician is
enabled further to judge of the increafe or decreafe of the difeafe. In the next co-
lumn you find 16, and over it ig?, which indicates that, when the Moon came to the
ftxteenth degree of Virgo, there was a true crifis, whereby the difeafe might be more
fully inveftigated, and a judgment framed according to the afpedts the Moon in
that degree had to the good or evil planets ;
for from hence will the patient or phy-
. fician defcry a better or worfe crifis, in progrefiive order. And thus, in the continued
line or column, you may run round the face of the Heavens, obferving the configu-
rations of the Moon when fhe comes to thofe places of the zodiac wherein file makes
the indicative, judicial, and critical, days, and what planet or planets fhe is then in
contadt with, and whether in the decumbiture they promife good or evil. Befides
this, you muft obferve on what day the Moon, or the lord of the afcendant, tranfits
the cufp of the fixth, feventh, and eighth, houfes, and how fhe is then afpedted with
the benevolent or malign planets; and obferve whether fhe be combuft, or in via
combujla, which is from the twentieth degree of Gemini to the firft of Cancer, in
the northern part of the zodiac, and in the fouthern from the fixth degree of Sa-
gittarius to the fixteenth of the fame conftellation ; and from the twenty-fourth
degree of Sagittarius to the fifth degree of Capricorn, or in conjundlion, quartile,
or oppofition, of Saturn, or Mars, or of a combuft planet, or of fome fixed ftar of a
malignant nature; for in all thefe cafes an indication is given of death, or of long
and fevere ficknefs, according to the number of teftimonies and aftral indications,
as exprefied in the rules given in my Illustration ofAstrology ; but in which
the following moft valuable Table was omitted.

AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES: 381
With refpedt to moderate or flight difeafes, Hippocrates afferted, in the firft
place, “That contraries, or oppofites, are the remedies for each other;” and this
maxim he explains by an aphorifm; in which he fays, that evacuations cure thofe
diftempers which come from repletion, and repletion thofe that are caufed by eva-
cuation. So heat is deftroyed by cold, and cold by heat, &c. In the fecond place
he afferted, that “ phyfic is an addition of what is wanting, and a fubtradtion or re-
trenchment of what is fuperfluous an axiom which is explained by this, viz. that
there are fome juices or humours, which in particular cafes ought to be evacuated,
or driven out of the body, or dried up ;
and fome others which ought to be reftor-
ed to the body, or caufed to be produced there again. As to the method to be
taken for this addition or retrenchment, he gives this general caution, That you
ought to be careful how you fill up, or evacuate, all at once, or too quickly, or too
much ;
and that it is equally dangerous to heat or cool again on a fudden ;
or ra-
ther, you ought not to do it: every thing that runs to an excefs being an enemy to
nature. In the fourth place, Hippocrates allowed that we ought fometimes to di-
late, and fometimes to lock up : to dilate, or open the paffages by which the hu-
mours are voided naturally, when they are not fufficiently opened, or when they are
clofed ;
and, on the contrary, to lock up or flraiten the paffages that are relaxed,
w'hen the juices that pafs there ought not to pafs, or when they pafs in too great
quantity. He adds, that we ought fometimes to fmooth, and fometimes to make
rough ;
fometimes to harden, and fometimes to foften again ; fometimes to make
more fine or fupple ;
fometimes to thicken ;
fometimes to roufe up, and at other
times to ftupify or take away the fenfe ;
all in relation to the folid parts of the bo-
dy, or to the humours. He gives alfo this farther lefifon, That we ought to have
regard to the courfe the humours take, from whence they come, and whither they
go ;
and in confequence of that, when they go where they ought not, that we make
them take a turn about, or carry them another way, almoft like the turning the
courfe of a river; or, upon other occafions, that we endeavour if poffible to recal,
or make the fame humours return back again ;
drawing upward fuch as have a ten-
dency downward, and drawing downward fuch as tend upward. We ought alfo to
carry off, by convenient ways, that which is neceffary to be carried off; and not
let the humours once evacuated enter into the veffels again. Hippocrates gives
alfo the following inftrudtion ;
That, when we do any thing according to reafon,
though the fuccefs be not anfwerable, we ought not too eafily, or too haftily, to al-
ter the manner of adting, as long as the reafons for it are yet good. But, as this
maxim might fometimes prove deceitful, he gives the following as a corredtor to it :
u We ought (fays he) to mind with a great deal ofattention what gives eafe, and what
-creates pain ;
what is eafily fupported, and what cannot, be endured.” We ought
No. 25. 5 E not
382 A KEY TO PHYSIC
not to do any thing raflity ;
but ought often to paufe, or wait, without doing any
thing : by this way, if you do the patient no good, you will at leaft do him no hurt.
Thefearethe principal and moft general maxims of the pra6tice of Hippocrates,
and which proceed upon the fuppofition, that nature cures all flight difeafes.
When, however, they are acute or fevere, they demand the utmoft ingenuity and
fkill of the phyflcian to moderate their violence ;
and it is then that their termina-
tion may be known by confulting the foregoing Table.
Of the UTILITY of the preceding TABLE.
IN order to fliow the great utility and convenience of this Lunar Table, in de-
ciding the event of any particular fit of illnefs, I fliall here ftate fome real predic-
tions which were made, during the indifpofltion of fome of my patients, and for
whom the following horofcopes were erected.
Charles
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 385
I have placed the horofcope of this patients nativity before the figure of his de-
eumbiture ;
in order to fhow, by way of analogy, that fuch an indifpofition would
certainly take place about this time, from the pofition of the fignificators, and their
particular configurations with the. heavenly intelligencers, at the time of his birth.
For this reafon, the figure of the fick perfon’s nativity fhould always be infpe&ed
where it can be had, becaufe.it enables us the better to judge, in many intricate
cafes, whether the difeafe will terminate with life or death ;
for although, in moft
common maladies, it is poffible to determine this queftion pretty accurately, by the
help of the preceding Table, without the radical figure of birth, yet, where that can:
be had, our judgment will in general be more certain, and often infallible.
In the above figure of the decumbiture of the patient, we find the Moon hath
lately tranfited the place of the Sun and Jupiter in the figure of birth ;
and that this
place is in the fiery triplipity, afflifting the Moon in the radical point with a quar-
tile alpedt; at the fame time that the Moon and Mars beholding each other with a
trine, from fiery figns, at the time of birth, clearly fhows that the native would be
fubjedl to fevers of the inflammatory kind. But I lhall decline making any com-
ments on the temperature of the native, or the defignation of his fignificators at the

time of birth ;
as it is not my intention here to explain the mode of calculating
a nativity, that being already fufficiently demonftrated in my Illustration of
Astrology. All that can be neceffary here, is to give a few examples from the
decumbitures of different patients, compared with the horofcope of their nativity,
in order to fhow, by the Table, whether fuch fick perfons would live or die. And,
in doing this, it will be proper for thofe who with to be convinced of the truth and
exiftence of the celeftial influx, to pay the ftridteft attention to the Moon’s places in
the Table, and what pofitions of the benefic or malefic afpedts fhe tranfits, or comes
in configuration with ;
fur from thefe events will the malady of each particular
patient be abated or increafed; and from thefe of courfe mull our judgment be
ultimately drawn.
By the decumbiture of the patient now under confideration, we fee that the Moon,
at the time of his falling Tick, was in twenty-two degrees forty minutes of Virgo.
To this I add tw'enty-two degrees thirty minutes of the zodiac, which brings her to
fifteen degrees ten minutes of Libra, and is her firft indicative place. At the time
the arrives here, I find, by examining the preceding horofcopes, that fhe is within
orbs of a Textile afpedt of Mars, which indicates a ftrong fever ;
though not ex-
tremely .ardent, owing to the Moon’s tranfiting tbe place of Venus in the figure of
birth. I now add, or pafs on to, twenty-two degrees thirty minutes more of the zo-
diac, which cuts an angle of forty-five degrees, and brings the Moon’s place to fe-
ven degrees forty minutes of Scorpio, which gives her judicial time, and furniflies
the means of directing our judgment whether a fevere or favourable crifis would
follow. To this end I infpeft the figures, and find that the Moon now comes to a
conjunction of the two benevolent planets Jupiter and Venus, which alone prog-
nofticates a favourable crifis ;
and the more fo, as at this time the Moon nearly tran-
fits the place of Saturn in the horofcope of birth : accordingly, the patient became
much better, the fever decreafed, and his pulfe was more regular. From the Moon’s
judicial place in Scorpio, I now pafs on twenty-two degrees thirty minutes further,
which Ihows her fecond indicative pofition, in ten minutes of Sagittarius ;
where,
finding no particular afpeCt of the principal ftars or luminaries, it portended little
or no alteration in the ftate of the difeafe at this time ;
and fo it happened. I now
advance twenty-two degrees thirty minutes more, which Ihows the place of the
Moon on that day to be in twenty-two degrees forty minutes of Sagittarius, where
fhe produced the firft crifis of the diforder. It was now obfervable, that from the
laft indicative day to the time of this crifis, the patient fhowed figns of a delirium,
and rambled much in his talk, concerning riding of horfes; which exactly corref-
ponds with the nature of the fign w here the crifis fell ;
but it was evident he would
recover from this, and be much mended, when the Moon formed her trine with
Saturn,

Saturn, to which /he was approaching, in twenty-nine degrees twenty-fix minutes
of Sagittarius. When this afpeCl was formed, the patient had vifibly recovered,
and the brain was never after affe6ted. I now proceed twenty-two degrees thirty
minutes more on the zodiac, which brings the Moon to her next indicative day, in
fifteen degrees ten minutes of Capricorn. Here the two ceieftial luminaries form a
quartile, a difcordant afpeCt, which gave the patient a relapfe. Proceeding the
next twenty-two degrees thirty minutes, I come to the Moon’s judicial place, in
feven degrees forty minutes of Aquaries. Here we find a mundane trine, formed
by Jupiter and Venus with the Moon, and a zodiacal trine of Mercury, a plain de-
monftration that the diforder mull abate, and that a favourable crifis would enfue.
To the feven degrees forty minutes of Aquaries, I add twenty-two degrees thirty
minutes more, which brings the Moon to her fiecond indicative place, in ten mi-
nutes ofPifces. Viewing the decumbiture, I now find the Moon approaches to a
trine afpeCl under the benign influence of Jupiter and Venus, which overcomes the
quartile of Mars, and indicates that the difeafe would be completely conquered
by the next crifis. To afcertain the truth and manner of this* I proceed onwards
twenty-two degrees thirty minutes more, which brings the Moon to twenty-two
degrees forty minutes of Aquaries, where the fecond grand crifis was to be pro-
duced. Now upon maturely infpe&ing the decumbiture, I find the Moon, at the
time this patient was feized with his diforder, was placed in her north node, and
contributed to the evil effects of the other configurations; but at the time of this
grand crifis, flie is fortunately pofited in her foutli node, thereby helping to deprefs
the vitiated humours of the body, and to overcome the difeafe. This pofition, con-
tributing to the favourable influence of the other configurations, reftored the pa-
tient from his bed of ficknefs, and his ftrength gradually increafed ; fo that by the
time the Moon formed her conjunction with Saturn, as expreffed on the face of
the heavens in the figure of his decumbiture, the mafs of blood was purified from:
all feverifh fyrnptoms, and the patient was reftored to his accuftomed health and
ftrength. And thus we may fee, that by ereCting the decumbiture, or figure of the
pofitions of the heavenly bodies, at the time any patient is feized, and proceeding in
this manner to afcertain the influence of the good or evil afpedls on the indicative,
judicial, and critical, days, we ftiall, without difficulty, be able to determine whether
the difeafe will prove flight or dangerous, and be dire&ed accordingly in our regi-
men and mode of treatment. But in order to make this fpeculation ftill more ob-
vious to the young practitioner, as well as to the curious reader, I fhall now pro-
ceed to examine the decumbiture of a patient, whofe difeafe was more malignant,
and proved fatal.

AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 387
- Thefe figures I ereded while refident in Briftol, at the requefl of my good friend
Dr. Till Adams, who being feized with a malignant fever, accompanied with dan-
gerous fymptoms, and being himfelf a friend to, and an admirer of, the Occult
Sciences, was defirous of feeing the refult of fuch an enquiry, and of judging him-
felf, by thefe means, whether he fhould live or die.
In confidering the fidereal effed of the preceding figures, it is by no means requi-
fite to calculate the genethliacal prognoftications of the feven erratics at the time of
the native’s birth. It is however neceffary to notice their principal afpeds and po-
fitions in the horofcope, in order to determine whether the fame pofitions are tranf-
mitted, or fimilar or adverfe afpeds formed in the decumbiture, at the time the pa-
tient is taken ill ;
but no further or more minute fpeculation is required, fince we
are neither confidering the effed of diredions, nor the fate of a nativity ;
but are
endeavouring to prove, that, by only obferving the pofition of the heavens at the time
the patient is taken ill, the probable termination of the difeafe might be foretold,
and whether it would end in life or death. Firft, then, we may obferve, the Moon
is fituated in the eighth houfe, termed by the ancients the houfe of death, becaule
of its obfcurity and pofition under the earth. Befides this, we find the Moon in
oppofition to Saturn, who was her difpofitor at the time of birth; and from this
afped fhe forms an oppofition with Venus, the lady of the dodor’s afcendant; and
immediately approaches to an oppofition of the Sun, the fountain of life. Thefe
are three evil diredions by pofition, and furnifh a very unfavourable profped of
the event of the difeafe. For the Moon, the giver of radical moifture, afflided by
the adverfe rays of the Sun, the author of vital heat, fails not to produce fuch a
putrifadion of the animal juices, as to bring on a fpeedy diffolution of the body.
Let us then examine the decumbiture by our Table, and fee how and when this
fatal event would take place.
At the time the patient fell fick, we find the Moon in ten degrees forty-fix mi-
nutes of Leo ; to which add tw'enty-two degrees thirty minutes for the firft indica-
tive time, which falls in three degrees fixteen minutes of Virgo; and indicates the
nature of the difeafe to be a fever; for the Moon, from this indicative place, be-
holds the Sun in the radical point with a baneful quartile afped ;
and the Moon,
according to her own nature, was Saturnine, as departing from afextile configura-
tion with Saturn in the radix, to a quartile with Venus, lady of the afcendant, and
giver of life ;
and therefore, according to the aftral rules of the immortal Ptolomy,
this firft motion of the Moon from the radical point of the decumbiture indicated
evil. I now go forward twenty-two degrees thirty minutes more, for the firft judi-
cial day, which places the Moon in twenty-five degrees forty-fix minutes of Virgo.
Now as the Moon is not configurated at this judicial time with either of the planets,
neither
388 A KEY TO PHYSIC
neither by tranfit In the nativity, nor afpeft in the decumbiture ;
and her judicial
place falling in the twelfth houfe, the houfe of afflidtion; we cannot draw any fa-
vourable judgment from thefe circumftances ;
but, on the contrary, a dangerous
cribs is to be expedted.
r
lo this judicial time, we add twenty-two degrees thirty
minutes more, and it brings the Moon fixty-feven degrees from the place die oc-
cupied when the patient was feized w ith the disorder ;
and this is her fecond indica-
tive place, which falls in eighteen degrees fix teen minutes of Libra. Now, if we in-
fpedl the foregoing horofcopes, we fhall find the Moon, in approaching to this point,
has juft departed from a baneful oppofttion with Jupiter, w hich, having the diredl
oppofite effedt of a conjundtion with that benevolent planet, which reprefents the
heart and vital principle, fliows a contaminated or morbid ftate of the blood and
lymph. We likewife perceive the Moon is in quartile to her own radical place,
tranfiting at the fame time the body of Venus, and making this afpedt the harbin-
ger of a fatally-approaching crifis. To determine this fadt, I proceed twenty-two
degrees thirty minutes further in the zodiac, which brings the Moon to ten degrees
forty-fix minutes of the fign Scorpio, at which point of time the crifis, or critical day,
of this patient’s difeafe occurred. Now by infpedting the figures, we fhall perceive
this crifis is ulhered in by fuch evil configurations of the heavenly bodies, the fe-
cond caufes under nature, as would not only heighten the malady, and put it out
of the power of medicine to fubdue, but would infallibly terminate in death. In
the firft place we fliall notice, that the Moon tranfits the place of Saturn in the ra-
dical point; fecondly, file is configurated in a malefic quartile afpedt of Saturn in
the decumbiture ;
thirdly, fhe is within orbs of a baneful quartile of Venus, lady
of the patient’s afcendant ;
and fourthly, fhe is rapidly approaching to a quartile
configuration of the Sun, which is inimical to life and motion, without any one
friendly afpedt of the benefic planet Jupiter intervening, to leffen or repel the
malefic influence. Such, therefore, are the teftimonies, that under any kind of ma-
lady and wherever they occur, infallibly portend the death of the patient ; and they
accordingly put an end to the exiftence of this much-refpedted man, whofe integrity
in his profeffion had gained him univerfal efteem, and renewed in him the ineftima-
ble character of the immortal Culpeper, who, never, with a view to gain, gave two
medicines for the cure of an afflicted fellow-creature, when one was fufiicient.
But death levels all diftindtions ; and, in ftridt conformity with the time and manner
pointed out by the above decumbiture, it conduced the foul of this excellent man
from an earthly to an heavenly habitation, on the 20th of February, 1786, at the
time the Moon formed her quartile afpedt with the Sun, which was in eight days
from the time he was feized with the fever, and fix days after it was foretold by the
preceding horofcopes ; from whence, having forefeen the doctor’s fate, I compofed
an
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 389
an Elegy on his death, while he was yet alive, which I got printed, and publifhed
on the very day he expired ;
thus manifesting to the world, with the patient’s earned
approbation, an incontrovertible inftance of the verity of aftral predidtion.
Having thus far endeavoured to prove the utility of the Lunar Table, by the in-
difpofition and recovery of Charles Thomas, a pupil of Mr. Hall, engraver to
his majefty, in the one cafe; and by the ficknefs and death of Dr. Till Adams, iri
the other ;
I ihall now, for the farther fatisfadtion of the reader, prove, that it is
poffible to judge whether a patient will live or die, from the horofcope of the de-
cumbiture only, without knowing or recurring to the horofcope of the patient’s na-
tivity, or time of birth.—To this end, the following axiom muft ever be remember-
ed : That if we find, at the time any perfon is feized with illnefs, that the Moon is
afflidted by more than one planet ; and that on the next critical day ilie forms a
congrefs with the malefic planets Saturn and Mars, either by conjundtion, quartile,
or oppofition, the fick perfon fhall die on the day and hour in which the afflidted
Moon comes to the interficient point of the zodiac ;
as the great Ptolomy declareth
in his 16th Aphorifm : “We muft behold the motion of the Moon as the pafieth
through the critical, judicial, and mortal, days ; for, if the be in them fortunate, it
fareth well with the patient ; but, if unfortunate, the contrary.” I Ihall exemplify
this b the following example.

Being fent for toaperfon who fell fick on the 10th of April, 1791, and being de-
firous to know the event of his difeafe, I examined the face of the heavens at the
exa6t time the patient was feized, viz. at half pall twelve o’clock at noon, when the
celellial intelligencers were pofited as in the above decumbiture, and which are as
follow : The Moon, which in all decumbitures reprefents the fick perfon, is fituated
within the quartile influence of no lefs than four planets, Saturn, Mars, Mercury,
and the Sun; and, as they are all within orbs of a conjundtion with each other, it
follows that the difeafe would bear defignation of their joint pernicious influx,
which, fcientifically confidered, manifefts a fever, with putrefadlion of the animal
juices, as thofe {killed in the aflral fcience will quickly fee. For the Sun’s burn-
ing influence, in conjundlion with Mars, a hot and violent planet, and Mercury
being controvertible in his nature, unites in the malefic rays of the Sun and Mars;
and, although Saturn is conftitutionally cold, yet, being alfo dry, his cold quality
is over-balanced, inafmuch as drought participates of the qualities of heat, being
fuel for the fire. Yet the cold quality of Saturn fpecificates the difeafe, by fhow-
ingthatit fprung from a cold caufe, or deathly chill, extended over the whole cir-
culating fyftem, or mafs of blood.
On examining the patient, he informed me he had drunk a quart of cold water,
being overcome with heat and thirft, and in a violent perfpiration, whence his blood
muft have been in a highly-inflamed ftate. This feems eminently prenoted by the
Moon’s pofition in a watery fign, and a moveable one, at the fame time in oppofi-
tion to the four planets above-mentioned, in fiery figns. Here, then, we at once
perceive the fource and malignity of the difeafe ;
and finding neither of the benefic
ftars caft a fingle ray, either by body or afpedt, to the aphetic place, I thence con-
cluded the patient muft inevitably die, notwithftanding the Moon was beheld by a
fextile configuration of Venus, which ftrengthened his nature, and fliowed that he
would greatly ftruggle with the malady. But as the teftimonies of evil arifing from
the joint influence of Saturn, Mars, Mercury, and the Sun, are more and much
greater than the contra-fupport afforded by Venus, I reafonably concluded the pa-
tient would die of the diforder, and that it was not in the power of medicine to fave
him. My next endeavour was to determine the hour of death. With this view I
look to the Table, p. 380, for the Moon in Cancer; and, in the fifth column from the
left, I find the degree the Moon was in at the time the patient was feized, viz. 7 30
;
and then, guiding my eye along till I come to the ninth column, I find 7 30 of
Libra ;
now, Libra being oppofite to Aries, the malefic planets Saturn and Mars of
courfe fend their oppofite malignant beams into that fign, Saturn in ten degrees
eighteen minutes, and Mars in thirteen degrees twenty-fix minutes; I therefore con-
cluded, that, when the Moon came to feven degrees thirty minutes of Libra in the

zodiac, the crifis would take place, as may be feen at the top of the fifth column in
the Table; and that when the Moon came to ten degrees eighteen minutes, being
the oppofition of Saturn, a vifible change in the patient would take place for the
worfe; and that when file arrived at the thirteenth degree twenty-fix minutes of
the fame fign, thereby forming the oppofition with Mars, the difeafe would prove
mortal, and terminate in death. If, therefore, the duration of the difeafe be reck-
oned by the motion of the Moon, we fhall find, without any enquiry from the nurfe
or do6tor, that the patient died about half paft four o’clock in the afternoon, on
the 17th of April, 1791, at which precife time the critical afipeCt on which the dif-
eafe turned was formed. Thus was afforded an inconteftible proof of the correCt-
nefs of my Lunar Table, and of the force and power of the planetary influx on
fublunary bodies. -
;
Of the DIFFERENCE betwixt a NATURAL and VIOLENT DEATH,
exemplified by the FATE of the late KING and QUEEN of FRANCE.
WITH a view to teach the curious reader how to diftinguifh the aftral teftimo-
nies portending a violent death from thofe which forefhow our natural diffolution,
I fhall, by way of example, inveftigate the particular configurations which prenoted
the violent death of the late unfortunate Louis NVI. king of France, and his
unhappy confort, Marie-Antoinette of Auftria. For this purpofe I have annexed
a copper-plate engraving of their nativities, with figures of the pofitions of the ce-
leftial intelligencers at their coronation, and on the days -of their execution. Who-
ever has perufed my Illustration of Astrology, will have feen, that in my
predictions, publifhed in the year 1786, I foretold the revolution in the French
empire, and the dethronement and execution of the French king and queen, fix
years before it happened ;
with all the dreadful confequences appertaining thereto,
exaCtly as they have fince fallen out ; and whoever lives to fee the upfliot of a few
years, will alfo fee every other part of my predictions literally fulfilled. I could
even now publiih to the world the fuccefs and termination, of many great events,
which all men are anxious to know, though few perhaps would believe, were I at
liberty to difclofe them. The fafety of particular individuals, the well-being of the
Rate, the peace of fociety, the profperity of empires, hang upon the ilfue of a few
revolving periods; and, though m/e the age we live in, yet few would brook the
admonitions of a friend, though they fhould lead to a profperity and riches—to
glory and renown. The uncommon pofitions of the heavenly bodies, which are
the fecond caufes in the fecref operations of Nature, are at this time well worthy
the attentive confideration of the naturalift and fpeculative philofophe'r. Their
mundane influence is by no means confined to the nations of Europe, but threatens

God, in his unbounded favour to the Britiih ifles, will overfhadow and protect
them : and it is not impoffible but the day may come, when the humble author of
thefe remarks may be at liberty to amplify and develope the fubjeCl in fome future

Louis XVI. was born the 23d of Auguft, 3h. 50m. P. M. 1754. The fign Sa-
gittarius afcended upon the eal'tern fineter of the horizon, intercepted by Capricorn ;
wherefore J upiter and Saturn are the lords of his afcendant, and, with the Moon in
the tenth houfe, reprefent his perfon. From the nature and quality of thefe fignifi-
cators, we may deduce the following inferences : That Saturn being in the afcend-
ant gave the native a wavering and irrefolute difpofition; the Moon pofited in
Scorpio gave him a tafte for luxury; and Jupiter, being co-fignificator in the
eighth houfe, in afpeCfc with Mercury, rendered him mild and pafiive, yetdeclared that
his principal aCtions fhall be attended with difappointment, and produce him much
anxiety, vexation, and infult. In the royal hereditary figure of birth, we find four
planets occupying the houfe of death; and as the Moon, giver of life, is difpofed of
by one of thofe planets, it is an argument that he would not live to an old age.
The precife time of death is only afcertainable by bringing up the feveral directions
of the nativity: and, as the method of doing this is already amply explained in my
Illuftration of Aftrology, we muft refer thofe who choofe to work them up, for any
affiftance they may want, to the rules there laid down. Suffice it here, that we
point out thofe tefti monies from the face of the nativity, that are always found to
be arguments of a violent death. Thefe are, Firft, Saturn in the afcendant, po-
fited in a violent fign. Secondly, the Moon, giver of life, configurated with the vio-
lent fixed ftar Chaelae. Thirdly, the lord of the afcendant malevolently conjoined
with the lord of the houfe of death. Fourthly, the two lights of the world depreffed
in the eighth houfe. And, fifthly, the Moon elevated in the dignities of an infor-
tune, and Mars, her difpofitor, having his fall in a human fign, plainly demon-
ftrate that the native fhould fall by the hand of man. And this was unhappily veri-
fied by his execution, on the 21ft day of January, 1 793, at twenty-two minutespaft
ten in the morning; at which time thefe malefic directions came up, as reprefented
in the figure of his execution, in the preceding plate. At that fatal moment we find
the Sun, the light of time, was in his detriment; that Mercury, the fignificator of

the
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 393
the French people, occupied the cufp of the tenth houfe, tranfiting the place of
Saturn, the king’s fignificator, at the time of birth ;
and that the two malefic planets
Saturn and Mars are in reception of each other; and that the Moon, the fignifica-
tor of life, is furrounded with violent fixed liars, in oppofition to the benign planet
Jupiter, in angles, and in quartile to Mars, her difpofitor in the horofcope of birth ;
all which peculiar configurations are fo many drong and irreliftible arguments of
the refolution of the people to proceed to extremities, and of the irrevocable fate
of this unfortunate monarch. For, although Jupiter, his co-fignificator, is ob-
ferved to fend a friendly ray to the aphetic place, yet having no dignities, and be-
ing difpofed of by Mars, the fignificator of the convention, this benefit afpeCt was
deprelfed, and its influence overcome, by the redundancy of a malefic influx.
This admirably points out the ftruggles of Dumourier, in the hope of being able
to preferve the life of the king; but his endeavours were quickly borne down by
the violence of the leading faction, and there was not a man to be found who
had courage enough to fecond his heroic intentions. This alfo, by the rules of
the fidereal fcience, is clearly prenoted by the circumdance of Mars being the
difpofitor of Jupiter; and that Mars is difpofed of by Saturn, the author of pu-
fillanimity and fear. Thus the afcendant of birth Jhows that want of refolution
and intrepidity in the native, which, if exerted in the favourable moment, would
have turned the daggers of his enemies towards their own breads, and have per-
manently fecured himfelf and his poderity on the throne ;
and thus the figure of
his decumbiture points to the fatal execution of the guillotine, and proves, that
although the' native fprung from a mod illudrious houfe, having the two fuperior
planets for his fignifreators, and although he ivas a king, at one time beloved and
idolized by his people, yet that he was but a man, fubjeCt to the fevered reverfe
of fortune, and doomed to as ignominious an end as the vileft of his fubjects !
The elegant and accompliflied confort of this unfortunate monarch was born
on the 2d of November, 17 55, 7h. 23m. P. M. as expreded in the plate. In
the figure of her nativity, we find the Moon is lady of the afcendant, rifing upon
the fign Libra, in the fifth houfe, the houfe of pleafure and fexual enjoyment; of
which, it is fufficiently evident, fhe was padionately fond. Mars being pofited on
the afcendant, in his edential dignities, fhows her to have been dately, audere,
and proud; yet predicts that die would be unfortunate in her connections, and
impatient of controul. This is the more obvious, becaufe Mars, the fignificator
and infiuencer of her padions, is dignified in her afcendant, though approaching
to an oppofition of Saturn, lord of the feventh and eighth houfes, who is like wife
configurated in his edential dignities, and, more extraordinary dill, is pofited in
No. 26. 5 H the
594 A KEY TO PHYSIC
the exaltation of Mars. This gave her an unconquerable fpirit, and ftrong na-
tural paftions, with an infatiable appetite for intrigue, united to an inconftant and
arbitrary turn of mind. This is ftill more ftrongly demonftrated by the prefence
of four planets in the fifth houfe, and two of them afpe6ted in the fign Scorpio.
That her reputation would be arraigned by the voice of the multitude, is fore-
fhown by the Dragon’s Tail being in the tenth houfe, the houfe of dignity and
honour ;
and the treachery of her confidants is pointed out by Mercury being in
the fixth houfe, in his detriment, and in oppofition to the Part of Fortune. That
her confort would be involved in misfortunes, and fuffer greatly on her account,
is made manifefl by Saturn, the fignificator of the king, being in oppofition to
Mars ;
and the Moon, lady of her afeendant, in baneful quartile to both the in-
fortunes. Indeed, there never was a nativity yet made public, wherein the in-
fortunes were fo mifehievoufly configurated, or wherein the general fignificators
fo confpicuoufly denoted individual misfortune and univerfal rage. But I fliall
pafs over, for the prefent, any farther remarks on the unfortunate defignation of
the fignificators in this nativity, and notice them no farther than as they point
out the teftimonies of a violent and premature death. Thefe are : Firft, the Sun
and Venus, configurated with a violent fixed ftar, in a violent fign. Secondly, Mars
afeending to the violent fixed ftar Hercules ;
and the fign afeending being of a
violent nature. Thirdly, the lord of the eighth houfe, the houfe of death, affliCt-
ing the Moon in the aphetic place. Fourthly, the lord of the fixth houfe afflict-
ing the Moon, the lady of the afeendant, and fignificator of life, with a malefic
quartile ray, the harbinger of violence, and the prefage of death.
Thus we may oblerve, that one of the principal luminaries is afflicted by both
the infortunes, and the othe ris pouted in a violent fign, denoting aviolent death.
Again, the lord of the eighth houfe, a malevolent planet, afflicted by the quartile
rays of an infortune by nature, is another prefage of untimely death. Alfo the
lady of the afeendant, in a violent fign, banefully configurated with the infor-
tunes, and the difpofitor of the luminaries in a violent fign, is an irrefragable proof
of an approaching untimely death. Now, the Moon, who is lady of the afeendant,
having her fall in a human fign, portends aviolent death by the hand of man ; and,
if we examine the face of the heavens at the time of her execution, we fliall find
her death proceeded from the violence of an ufurped power, occupying the feat of .
juftice ;
for the Moon, elevated in her afeendant at the time of birth, is moft re-
markably configurated in the fall of the Sun at the time of her execution ;
and that
fame fign culminating on the cufp of the tenth houfe, the houfe ofjuftiee, and the
Sun being pofited there in his fall, in conjunction with Mercury, moft aptly de-
feribes
AND THE OCCULT SCIENCES. 395
fcribes the manner of the native’s death. Mercury, who is the natural fignificator
of the French people, being in his effential dignities, elevated, and in reception of
Venus, lady thereof ;
and Mars beholding Jupiter with a quartile ray, pofited
in the twelfth houfe, and lord of the afcendant of death ;
and the Moon, lady of
afcendant of birth, being within orbs of an oppofition of Mars and Venus, who
have their fall in the houfe of dignity and honour; all tend to forefhow that roy-
alty was for a time to be deftroyed in France; as is moft wonderfully prenoted in
the horofcope of the coronation. And what is very remarkable, at the time of
the French monarch’s death, the Sun, who is king among the planets, was pofit-
ed in his own detriment, or in that peculiar point of the heavens which is oppofed
to his own houfe ; and at the time of the unfortunate queen’s execution, the Sun
was in his fall, without a fingle dignity to fupport him, as is moft clearly evinced
by the horofcopes in the preceding plate ;
fo that we may fay, the ftars in their
courfes fought againft this illuftrious pair, as they fought againft Sifera of old ;
and thus we may perceive, that the moft valiant and the moft courageous are
not proof againft the fhafts of fate ;
