The sky was so red, it was not the blood red, and it was very spectacular! There were a lot of red clouds, the land was red too, so I went ahead and I came to a red river, the water was so beautiful and red, so far I feel relaxed and happy, a particular emotional experience! Firstly, I saw a person who I didn't know at all killed in the river. (After I told the story to my grandfather, he said his grandfather was killed in a similar place, and all of the details were almost the same! I was surprised.) There was a ferry and a boatman there. I asked if he would take me across the river. He hesitated for a while and eventually granted my request. When I got into the boat, I felt very happy, special feelings coming out. When I landed on the opposite bank there was what looked like a garden, there were many houses in there. I went to an inn because I felt a little bit tired. They wanted different money and I hadn't any such money. I also met a deceased person; my grandfather's mother was living there! She treated me very nicely.

Another interesting thing is when I was awake; others told me sometimes I can repeat all of the words in some books.
