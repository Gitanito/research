I was in class but the teacher had left the classroom. My friends and I were playing. As I ran through the passage, one of my friends  hit me. I fell on my back and my head hit the ground hard on a part of the neck. 

For a moment everything went black.  Then there was a white light.  I saw the faces of my friends who were asking if I was dead.  I could hear them and I saw a couple of them try to touch my face to see if I was OK. My hands moved away from them.  I then saw myself on the floor. I saw everything had gone white again. Then  I awoke on the floor where I had fallen. 

I didn't know what was happening.  I heard and saw people trying to resuscitate me. I saw myself but I didn't float; I didn't see a tunnel or a heavenly voice; nor did I see anything like that.  I just listened to the people there, but they couldn't hear me. 

Today I am 38 and never again did I have an experience like this. I don't know anyone that this has happened to. That is all that I remember.
