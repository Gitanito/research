  		              		Experience Description   

    In 1980, when I was 31 years old, I lost my 5 month old son in the womb.

  I had an infection and my doctor decided to deliver my son by caesarian section. Unfortunately,  his lungs weren’t developed enough so  he died.
  
  When I got back to my room, I experienced an out of body experience.

  I left my body and I was hovering over my bed. I saw four or five nurses  and possibly a doctor trying to revive me. They had white coats on, which was the usual attire back then. 
  
  Then I felt myself being lifted up to Heaven. I wasn’t in pain and I wasn’t afraid. It was very peaceful. 

  When I got halfway there, I asked   God, 'But what about Randall?' He was my husband at the time, and I know I wanted to come back and be of help to him because he had mental health issues.
  
  I felt as if God said, 'OK!!' Then   I felt myself being let go and I slowly drifted back down into my body again.

  Now, 37 years later, I don’t remember if I awoke at this point and saw the nurses reviving me or not.  I think I did, though.
  
  I do know that I had an awesome sense of just how BIG GOD IS, and that we are as ants compared to Him. I remember telling myself, 'Don’t ever forget how BIG GOD IS.' And I haven’t forgotten.
  
  The next day, or a few days after this happened, I thought, 'Oh, I must have been carried by angels' because  they let go of my spirit when I asked to come back. It was very CLEAR that I was gently let go of and I started drifting back down to Earth.
  
  I never saw anything. I didn’t see God and I didn’t see Heaven. I didn’t see a tunnel of light, nor angels. It was all just feelings, but without any fear. It was VERY PEACEFUL!
  
  The ironic part of it all was that Randall, my husband, was unbearable when I returned. So,  I had to divorce him. I really wasn’t a help to him that I know of. That part has always rather confused me. He was on medication that made him do bizarre things.
  
  We both eventually remarried. 

  The message of my near-death experience has stuck with me through the years and is as vivid today as when it happened.

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     Since I didn't get to Heaven during the NDE, I can't fully verify this.

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No

  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I had an awesome sense of just how BIG GOD IS, and that we are as ants compared to Him. I remember telling myself, 'Don’t ever forget how BIG GOD IS.' And I haven’t forgotten.

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Uncertain   Coming back to help my husband seemed to be my purpose at the time.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     The moment I thought of my husband at the time, with worry about his well being, I was allowed to  come back to Earth. We ended up eventually divorcing, so that is somewhat confusing to me.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Feeling how BIG GOD IS.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    My niece was very influenced by it. I told her about it when she was 10 years old, and it inspired her to study NDEs and write about them as an adult.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   I'd heard of them, but my experience was not like what I'd heard.
