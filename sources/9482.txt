  		              		Experience Description   

    I had a D&C with a uterine biopsy. I had severe, abdominal pain that was going up into my shoulder. I went to the hospital and  was admitted. The abscess need to  drain  and I needed to receive IV antibiotics. The day after I was admitted, I was to have a procedure to insert the drain tube into the abscess in my pelvic cavity. On the morning of the procedure, I noticed  that I was wheezing. Yet, I couldn't figure out why. I remember thinking that I didn't really need any attention for wheezing. A nurse came into my room and told me they were taking me down to the x-ray department to insert the drain. The nurse did not acknowledge my wheezing and shortness of breath. I was positioned face-down on a table under a fluoroscope. After a few minutes, I told the doctor that I couldn't breathe. He said it would be just a few minutes more as he was almost done. I didn't have a few minutes left and I passed out. 

  The lack of the ability to breathe was so scary. I felt like I was fighting, but my body wasn't moving. I found myself in a dark place with four Beings around a table. They wore hooded cloaks. The light shone out of the front of the hoods, like a glowing light. Their hands were also made of light. I was located at my head but just slightly under the table and out of the way. These Beings worked very swiftly but they were certain in what each one of them had to do. There was no talking between them but it was a very coordinated effort. They may have been communicating telepathically but I'm not sure. I heard a humming type of noise, but I think it was coming from the other world. I couldn't understand any words. When the Beings were finished with my adjustments, I found myself instantly back in the earthly world and heading toward my physical body.
  
  Following the incident, I knew I was  back in my room but I don't remember getting there. I heard them say, 'There she is' and I had a ventilator mask on me. It took me a long time to get better, but there was a sense of assimilating what had been done to me into my life here on this plane.  
  
Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 2/2000  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes   Illness. Surgery-related.  CPR given.     Life threatening event, but not clinical death.   I had surgery and  had developed a severe internal abscess. They decided to drain it.  
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes.  I heard voices but they were so far away that I couldn't understand what they were saying. It was more of a humming noise.  I lost awareness of my body  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I felt more observant, but also curious.  
  
  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         I would say that I was more conscious during  the entire experience. Although, I can't conclusively say when the experience began. I know that when the experience ended, I just wanted to sleep.  
  
Were your thoughts speeded up?         Faster than usual  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Time seemed to go faster or slower than usual.     It seemed like I was back in my bed with oxygen being forced into my lungs.  I don't remember getting there other than going through a cement wall with the steel girders, cinder blocks and rolled insulation.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I'm not sure if it was enhancement or just a knowledge of what was coming next.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I heard nothing except some very far away voices and I couldn't hear what they were saying.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No       

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   It was like a bubble of light that I was in.  

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     I was in a black space. It was not frightening or uncomfortable.  
  
What emotions did you feel during the experience?         I was very curious. That is my nature to this day.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Relief or calmness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         No  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt no longer in conflict with nature  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about myself or others     It was everything about myself. I was living the wrong life. I was doing what I was supposed to do even though I was told I couldn't do anything. I was able to see how that was all wrong. Just like telling Jesus I was sorry when I had done nothing wrong. I had no doubt that I had done nothing wrong. There was not the usual searching in my mind and soul to see how I could have possibly screwed up. I knew with absolute certainty that I was innocent.  
  
Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Other faiths- New age.   I was raised in a fundamental Christian family. I had rejected that faith as it did not fulfill my spiritual needs.  
  
Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I know that any spiritual path claiming to be the only way or that there is one supreme being are not right for me. I feel that I am one with the universe and with nature.  

What is your religion now?         Other faiths- Unitarian and other liberal faiths   I believe that Nature is an appropriate example of spirituality as it was meant to be. There is no God or Satan. We do have spirits of loved ones around us.  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     This came at a time where I was in spiritual exploration. So I would call it more of a confirmation of the spirituality I was investigating. I was laying on a table in my spiritual body. I consciousness was kind of below the table. I got the sense of waiting patiently while these four light beings were working on me with the speed of light. They were not talking. Everyone seemed to know what area they were working on and how it all fit together. The light grew brighter and brighter and then suddenly extinguished.  I found myself walking through the exterior wall of the hospital, through the bricks, girders, studs, and insulation right into my bed. I knew that the bible doctrine of Jesus was a farce and sin was simply a controlling manipulation of people. It was nothing more than a power grab. I, however, even in my severely weakened condition never felt more powerful. I couldn't even feed myself. There were times where I gave up eating because I was too exhausted to chew. Still, I had power and the power was in my throat, chest, and root chakras.  
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     The fundamental dogma of the religion that I was brought up in is nothing but a lie. There is no Being sitting on a throne judging whether I was worthy or not. Everyone is worthy and everyone learns their lessons from the lives they have lived before as well as this one.  
  
  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   This was the crux of my experience. I was in a black place. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant. There were for entities with hooded black cloaks. From the hoods there was light and an aura. Their hands were also made of light.  
  
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     I got the sense that I had lived the first part of my life as agreed and now I was getting ready for the second part of my life. Both were agreed to prior to my incarnation.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I encountered four beings of light. They were cloaked and hooded with light coming out of the hoods and their hands were made of light.  
  
During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I am meant to carry forward using the knowledge I had gained from the previous part of my life. I am to apply it to help others and to heal myself.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     To continue to fulfill my purpose in this dimension, I had to have an energy adjustment.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.     My trip was in preparation for a spiritual awareness that I needed to prepare for my between-life and to help others.  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     The abuse I had been subjected to was only a part of the experience I needed for my evolution; I no longer needed these experiences. I was meant for 'other things' now.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     I learned that I was worthy of love and that, most of all, I had to learn to love myself. I could no longer accept the negative judgments of others.  
  
  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     I have made changes that go along with my new experiences. I know that once I have completed a goal I am meant to pursue another one. This isn't necessarily about the knowledge I gain, but also the enhanced sense of spirituality.  I am able to help people through their tough times. I am currently volunteering as an EMT on an ambulance. The knowledge I gained from this experience has helped me with compassion and seeing what is wrong with patients.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes All of my old relationships are gone. At the moment I have very few people in my life and those (including my daughter and grandchildren) are not close. It is very hard when I need help with something.  

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   I had trouble believing it but I knew it wasn't a dream. I just couldn't seem to get a handle on how to convince people it really happened. My own mother said, 'Just tell Jesus you're sorry and he will make it all go away.' I gasped out that I had done nothing wrong. I knew that was not the purpose of this event.  
  
How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I was so sick that I thought maybe God was punishing me for searching for my spiritual truth outside of the church. Maybe I imagined it all. Maybe I didn't really have a spiritual healing and alignment. At the same time, I knew that wasn't true. It was too vivid to have been my imagination.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     Somehow I can get into people's heads. Some people find it quite bothersome. I can call my daughter about something and she will tell me to please get out of her head. She was thinking about that right at that moment. I have also developed the ability of psychometry although it isn't just with objects. I can sense the atmosphere of places. I love visiting old places because of this.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The entire experience was meaningful. It showed me there are reasons for what happend in our lives and how we attract what we need.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       No      

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     It was just too real. It felt more real than my life. After the event, I began to heal at a fairly rapid rate.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     It was definitely real. The changes I have made in the second part of my life I would not have even contemplated during the first part of my life.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I think you should ask for the description of the even on the first page and then use the questions to hone it down.
