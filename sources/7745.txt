  		              		Experience Description   

  It was the end of the day on my fourteenth birthday. I was getting together a music band with a couple of friends. We had arranged a meeting at my house, where we would have a party. In the garden of my house we had installed a speaker, which was plugged into an electrical connection. My hand closed on the wire and, shocked, I fell onto the lawn. My friends, who witnessed all of it, thought it was a joke and were laughing. I felt the current all through my body like a strong buzzing. I couldn't move.   

  I knew I was about to die. I felt anguish for my parents, who were inside the house, and who would soon see my corpse lying in the grass. But my feelings soon changed, as my anguish developed into feelings of peace and love. I felt a powerful happiness and a sense of knowing where I was going.  

  I knew the place where they were sending me. I stopped thinking about my parents and about the world. Nothing was important except that feeling of love and of knowing I was returning home to my true life. There was a six-foot wall at the edge of the lawn that divided our house from our neighbor's. On this wall, I saw a light starting to grow. It was like a brilliant golden egg that was expanding, creating a tunnel of light. And at the same time my sense of security and of knowledge were growing. Everything became clear to me in all respects. A black figure wearing a cape, or a mantle, appeared, backlit by the light in this rotating tunnel. I knew that he had come to look for me. I felt happier than I had ever felt in my entire life.   

  Suddenly everything went out. I awoke in my father's arms as he was rushing me into the house. I tried to tell him that I was euphoric. I tried to say what had happened, but he just hushed me. I fainted once more. I woke up in my room, reclining in bed. My father asked me what had happened, so I tried to tell him what I had seen—but then didn't remember what I had seen!   

  I will never forget that feeling of peace and happiness. I had never been so happy as I was in this experience, nor have I ever felt that way since.

After the NDE:
