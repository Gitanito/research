PREFAC E.
In presenting this little work to the public, the author has
been impelled by a desire of furnishing some tangible and
positive evidence of the truth of Phrenology, and the practica
bility of a mathematical demonstration of this beautiful sci
ence, of practical utility.
It has long been a desideratum to obtain some uniform and
certain mode of ascertaining the exact amount of cerebral
matter or brain in the several compartments of the skull,
invariably assuming the point between the ears as the basis
N of the superstructure. This the author hopes he has success
fully accomplished.
Amongst the tables of admeasurements, are those of nearly
fifty remarkable or distinguished persons, contrasted with those
of idiots, murderers, &c. There are also nearly as many re
markable and well-authenticated skulls of the various nations
of the world.
He begs to express his obligations to those gentlemen who
have so kindly permitted their names to be used for the ad
vancement of science. To the ladies, also, he is much in
debted ; but, with that native modesty which is so character
istic of the American ladies, he could not obtain permission to
give their names in full.
A great portion of the skulls may be seen in his own
possession, and which he has been accumulating for some
years.*
* To ship-masters and others he will give liberal prices for well-authen
ticated foreign skulls of any description, to add to his cabinet.
7
The admeasurements of skulls here presented, it ought to
v
be understood, have not been selected for the purpose of main
taining a favorite theory, but embrace the greater part of
F. Coombs's private collection, and may at any time be seen
at his office, the remainder being, with one or two exceptions,
in the Museum of the Boston Medical Society, who will not
be accused of any partiality for the science. The author has
to express his obligations to the President, Dr. Warren, for
his politeness in the use of them. In these tables there is one
remarkable feature, which cannot fail to strike the superficial
observer. In comparing the intellectual faculties of the Afri
cans, Asiatics, Indians, and Malay variety of the human fam
ily, it will be seen, although some were gigantic men, there is
not one of them exceeding 41 in the organs of comparison
and causality ; whilst none of the heads of even very diminu
tive men, but who have distinguished themselves in letters,
are so deficient in the above organs. 4£ to 41 appears to be a
line of demarkation distinctly drawn betwixt superior and in
ferior heads. The establishment of this fact is probably one
of the most important of the present age, and constitutes a new
\ era in the science of Phrenology. It is hoped the results here
submitted will stimulate others in the profession to make simi
lar collections, and, if possible, by the same instrument ; for
which purpose the drawing is given. No phrenologist ought
to think of estimating the size or volume of brain, without fre
quently resorting to this instrument, as it will be found to be
of the very greatest importance in forming a correct estimate
of the proportions of the head, or phrenological organs. In
offering these remarks, the author conceives it to be a
duty he
owes the public to caution them not to condemn the science
from an imperfect examination of the head by mere tyros in
the profession. To this instrument he always resorts in doubt
ful or contested cases. The results obtained give the exact
length of fibre from the base of the brain, or point exactly mid
way between the ears, to the external development of every
organ. The temperaments of the individuals are not desig
nated, but of all the distinguished heads he has examined, the
whole of them, or nearly so, are strongly marked with the
bilious, and rarely with lymphatic. It will be seen that the
heads of giants are not corresponding with their extraordinary
statures, the Kentucky giant being small as a dwarf in some
of his animal organs. The head is somewhat in proportion to
8
the body, yet it by no means follows that a giant has a gigan
tic head.*
Strictly speaking, these admeasurements give ,
the
size of one hemisphere of the brain only, the other, of course,
being a complete counterpart, the action in both being simul
taneous. In comparing the heads of living persons with the
skulls, as a general rule about one eighth of an inch must-be
allowed to the skulls, to allow for the thickness of the hair,
integuments, &c, excepting in the organs of tune, construct-
iveness, and acquisitiveness, and also amativeness, in which
organs the thickness of the muscles cannot be ascertained.
We cannot, therefore, in these organs, compare the skulls with
the living heads ; every other organ may, allowing only the
difference as before stated. Language, and some of the per
ceptive organs, which cannot be measured, are omitted in this
scale.
* There is generally an analogous formation betwixt the head and body,
m so far as this : where he has observed a head very large in the animal
organs, it is usually accompanied with a strong, vigorous, muscular devel
opment of body, as admirably illustrated in the forms of the different
sexes. It will be almost invariably found, females are as deficient of
the combative propensities as of the physical powers necessary to carry
them into execution, of which fact persons may easily satisfy themselves
by comparing the widths of heads of the opposite sexes, man being usu
ally much the widest in the base around the ears where these organs are
located. The admeasurements of heads are also strikingly illustrative of
this fact, being almost invariably found wider from ear to ear in destruc-
tiveness in male heads of every description, as illustrated by the outlines
below. To those desirous of knowing their own exact cerebral organiza
tion, these tables are given for the purpose of enabling them to compare
themselves critically and accurately with the great variety of remarkable
heads given, also as a means of judging of the science.

The admeasurements of heads are also strikingly illustra
tive of this fact, being almost invariably found wider from ear
to ear in destructiveness, in male heads of every description,
as illustrated by the outlines of male and female below, being
that of a violent, passionate man, and a timid female.
Explanation of Lines, <5fc. on next page.
No. 1 is the correct drawing of the back-head of a reckless
murderer. No. 2 that of a cowardly Hindoo. The lines ra
diating from the base give the length of the organ 6, or de
structiveness ; the organ 12, or caution ; the perpendicular line
of firmness, &c. So in the tables of measures, they extend to
every organ except language and the perceptive faculties.
By turning the instrument on its axis, the balls resting in the
ears, [see the drawing,] we obtain with equal facility the
front, back, and side organs, or rather one perfect hemisphere
of the brain, to the fractional parts of inches, and this is pro
bably the only plan yet devised for obtaining the length or
size of each organ from this centre or base of the brain, admit
ted by all to be the point from which it may be said all the
organs originate.
These tables have been prepared with the most scrupulous
regard to accuracy, and have been invariably taken by himself,
(except his own head,) with the same beautiful instrument.
They arc intended for a twofold purpose
—
first, as a means of
accurate comparison between highly civilized, semi-barbarous,
10
and savage nations. Secondly, as a standard of comparison
for those who may wish to submit themselves to the same
rigid test of mathematical demonstration—
for which purpose
a vacant column is left for such comparison with F. Coombs's
approved bust, or
perfect head, also with the head of the Pres
ident of the United States, members of Congress, &c.
Whilst to many these tables may appear somewhat tedious
and uninteresting, yet the author conceives, to those who are
desirous of investigating the merits of the science, they will
prove highly attractive; the exact phrenological character of
every skull and person being accurately ascertained by this
mode, and every portion of the head presented to view with
much greater accuracy than the most costly engravings or
descriptions could do.
This mode of proceeding will also tend to disabuse the pub
lic mind of the erroneous ideas entertained as to the minute
bumps and depressions supposed to be mainly indicative of
character, but which rarely exist to any extent ; whilst by
these tables it will be seen that
many heads differ several
inches in the same
organs. It is this which enables the phre
nologist to give such striking evidences of the truth of the
science, and not from bumps which it would require a micro
scopic power to discover.

Explanation of the Mode of Reading the Character.
Each of the thirty-five organs are described in the degrees of
very large, large, full, moderate, and small, or
very small.
The written figures placed in the margin indicate the respec
tive sizes of each organ in the individual examined—
11 or 12
being the maximum, and 1, 2, 3, or 4 the minimum. For in
stance, if an organ is marked very large, it will be indicated
by the figures 11 or 12 being placed in the margin opposite
very large, 12 expressing a more active degree than 11, and
when marked so high, it is somewhat liable to abuse, or ex
cessive action, unless the controling organs are also very large.
When the organ or faculty is marked 9, or 10, it is then large,
and presents a strong feature of character, but not to abuse or
inordinate activity, unless the intellect or sentiments are very
deficient. When numbered 7, or 8, the faculty is then full,
but does not present great activity, but may be considered
above mediocrity. If marked 5, or 6, only, it is then but
moderate, or rather inactive, and implies a
deficiency of the
organ, and not easily roused to action. If marked as low as
1, 2, 3, or 4, it is then minimum, small, or very small, and
infers an extremely inferior or deficient development in organs
so designated.
To assist the student, the dot is placed opposite the particu
lar line applicable to the character of the person examined,
which line he is to read as his own character. The same scale
of figures is also applied to the temperaments, and the average
size of head and degree of activity.
The organ of Tune, and some few others, the author does
not usually mark, as the temporal muscle and ridge present
an impossibility of ascertaining exactly the size of these
organs.
In estimating the phrenological character, it may be found
that many of the organs are marked very large, from which
we have to fear an excessive action. In such case it is desi
rable that a check should be placed on the activity of such
organ or organs, (which, indeed, is the great use of a
phreno
logical examination,) by the continual exercise of those of a
dissimilar character. On the contrary, those which are mark
ed small, or moderate, require stimulating as far as practica
ble. Those organs which require repressing in their action
will be marked with a dash below the figure, and those
21
which need stimulating will have a dot •
above the figure.
The delineation of character by this mode may also sometimes
appear contradictory : thus, when the organs of Benevolence
and Acquisitiveness are both marked very large, the descrip
tion would then seem to imply that such a person Avould be
both miserly and generous. Such betray often a penny-wise
and pound-foolish disposition. The same may also be said of
Destructiveness, or
passion and severity coupled with great
good nature. Such an one will be as free to forgive as to re
sent an
injury. These feelings are
by no means incompatible
in the same
person.
The author has designated by marks several portions of the
brain, the functions of which are not fully ascertained. From
recent observations he is inclined to the opinion there is a semi-
intellectual function or organ, Suavity, (*) between 13 and 34.
The mark (?) under 17, the organ of Sublimity. Under 3, the
mark ($) is by some marked Inhabitiveness, which he does not
mark. The star (*) behind the ear, is Vitativeness, (doubt-
► ful.) The (*) before it, is Alimenliveness, confirmed by all
phrenologists. The star (*) beneath the eyes, one phrenolo
gist only conceives to be the organ of Chemicality. (Impro
bable.)
The organ of Tune the author declines marking, unless it is
extraordinary small or large, in consequence of the impossi
bility of ascertaining its exact size, from the thickness of the
temporal muscle which covers it. The temporal ridge, or
thickening of the skull in adult age, also presents a difficulty.

O !
happy love ! where love like this is found ;
0 ! heartfelt rapture ! bliss beyond compare ! \
I 've paced much this weary, mortal round,
And sage experience bids me this declare—
"
If heaven a draught of heavenly pleasure spare,"
One cordial in this melancholy vale,
'Tis when a
youthful, loving, modest pair,
In other's arms breathe out the tender tale,
Beneath the milk-white thorn that scents the ev'ning gale.

And cry content to that which grieves my heart,
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
And frame my face to all occasions ;
I '11 drown more sailors thad the mermaid shall ;

His soul unlovely, and his body lean with anxious care,
The widow's groan and orphan's tear he will not hear.
Tottering with age, he still doth grasp for more,

How soft, how lustrous, and how beautiful !

Like her, all beauty, smiles, and loveliness ?
Her roseate lips apart like opening flowers,
Inhale perfumes from heaven alone derived :
Blest creature ! she is indeed an angel-child.
Her open forehead and her sunlit eyes
With radiant lustre shone, reflecting happiness
And innocence within. She was a fair, a gentle child,
So full of mirth and pleasantry, yet seldom wild ;
Her hair in richest auburn tresses shone,
Dishevell'd o'er her alabaster shoulders hung.
In silken dalliance, with the gentle zephyrs playing,
Formed beauteous waving lines, like autumn's ripening fields.
Sweet fairy ! I have listened to her laughing prattle ;
How joyous, free, how gay and happy have I seen her I
Like some gay, carolling bird of jocund spring,
Discoursing nature's heavenly music wild.

Almost too beautiful for this dull earth.

I '11 not meddle with it ; it is a dangerous thing ; it makes a man a
coward ; a man cannot steal but it accuseth him ; a man cannot swear but
it checks him ; a man cannot lie but it detects him. 'T is a blushing,
shame-faced spirit, that mutinies in a man's own bosom ; it fills one full
of obstacles. It made me once restore a
purse of gold that by chance I
found ; it beggars any man that keeps it. It is turned out of all towns

endeavors to trust himself and live without it.

O, for a muse of fire, that would ascend
The brightest heaven of invention !
A kingdom for a
stage, princes to act,

Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,
Assume the

Leash'd in like hounds, should famine sword, and fire
Crouch for employment.

Location—on outer parts of the top of forehead, giving it a
squareness, as in Laurence Sterne.
And jocund laughter holding both his sides.
Now, by two-headed Janus,
Nature hath framed strange bedfellows in her time ;

That they '11 not shew their teeth, in way of smile,
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.

Small—
Want of observation ; very deficient in noticing minutiae.
Individuality very large, combined with very large intellect
and sentiment, gives desire for and appreciation of beauty, as
shown in the great sculptor Canova, (cut 39.) This organ
gives acuteness of perception and ready talents, an aptitude to
seize and combine the useful and the beautiful in nature or
art. This faculty, when very large, imparts a strength of
judgment, and general talents of a highly useful character,
and is large in most distinguished men.
Location—
at the bottom of forehead, between the eyebrows.

Large—
Power of delineating shapes ; distinct memory of persons.
Full—
Tolerable correctness of memory ; moderate skill in drawing.
Moderate—
A weak memory, and indistinct perceptions of form.

Form very large in precocious boy of Boston. [See cut 39£.]
This organ is invariably large in distinguished artists, sculp
tors, &c, and is highly necessary to mechanics, milliners, &c.
In children, also, this organ, when large, greatly facilitates
education, in acquiring the- rudiments, forming and learning
letters, &c.

Large—
Talents for analyzing and harmonizing shades of colour.
Full—
Accuracy in judging the effects and combinations of colours.
Moderate—
Want of talent, and deficient in skill for painting.
Small—
Total absence of the faculty of distinguishing colours.
Colour, when large, implies correctness and facility of judg
ment in colours, painting, &c. ; of harmonizing delicacy of
tints in shading with colours, &c.
It is a well-attested fact, that great numbers, with the keen
est sight, are unable to distinguish the great difference in even
the primitive colours. This offers one of the most conclusive
evidences of the existence of primitive faculties and natural
endowments. [See the cut No. 40 of the organ in Peter Paul
Reubens, the great painter.]
27—LOCALITY.
Very Large—
An extraordinary faculty of recollecting places.
Large—
A good memory of localities, and fondness for travelling.

Very methodical, sympathetic, and exact ; great formality.
Full—
Habits of order, but not very particular or attentive to detail.
Moderate—
Little precision or exactness, and a want of system.
Small—
Confusion and disorder ; general want of management.
Order implies the desire to systematize, arrange, and class
ify objects. Classification and generalization are absolutely
necessary to the philosopher and successful man of business.
Location—
on the external angle of the eye.
30.—EVENTUALITY.
Very Large—
Great powers of memory, and facility of acquiring.
Large—Easily acquires and retains knowledge ; good memory.
Full—
Power of remembering leading events, but not the minutiae.
Moderate—Inability of retaining much ; a weakness of memory.
Small—Extremely forgetful of incidents or facts in the detail.
This faculty, when very large, (see cut 43v) enables us to
treasure up whatever may occur—
what we hear, see, or
read. It may be said to be the power of recalling ideas to the
mind, and is an essential element to success in almost every
pursuit. Many can repeat, ad infinitum, verbatim et literatim,
that which they have heard or read but once ; whilst others
have been known to forget the names of their most intimate
friends, and even of their family, many amusing anecdotes of
which are on record. We remember a case of a very reverend
gentleman, who forgot his own wedding-day, and lost a wife.
It was this defect in the great Dr. Gall first drew his at
tention to facts in nature, which resulted in the discovery of
the science of Phrenology.
31.—TIME.
Very Large—Clear and correct ideas of time, memory of dates, &c.
Large—Accurate remembrance of chronological events and history.
Full—Indistinct notions of the lapse of time ; a poor recollection.
Moderate—Incorrect as to dates ; unable to keep or guess time.
Small—Extremely deficient and forgetful of dates or periods.
Time, perception and remembrance of chronological events,
dates, &c. This faculty exists in very different degrees in
various persons. Some have great facility in measuring,
76
guessing, beating time, &c, whilst others are perfectly incom
petent to do either. It is large in eminent musicians.
Location—
adjoining and outside Locality.
32—TUNE.
Very Large—
Great intuitive fondness and ready talent for music.
Large—
Musical taste and judgment, and a great lover of harmony.
Full—
Extremely fond of music ; good conception of melody.
Moderate—
Mediocrity of taste in music ; deficient in talent or skill.
Small—
No appreciation of the science ; inability to learn music.
Tune, (see cut 44, Handel, very large,) perception of melody,
harmony, or discord. We have the most conclusive evidence
of the existence of this organ, as it will be found that some
who hear equally well with others, are quite unable to compre
hend the simplest airs, or
enjoy any of the pleasures arising
from the concord of sweet sounds; whilst some again are so
highly endowed with this faculty, they devote their whole ex
istence to the pleasures of music. Some of the higher
order of animals, as the horse, &c, have some endowment of
this faculty, from the excitation and pleasure evidently afforded
them by hearing music.
There is great difficulty in designating the exact strength or
development of this organ, from the temporal muscle and
ridge covering it. We therefore usually omit marking it,
unless very large or very small.
Location—
immediately above Number ; indicated by width
of lower temples.
THE MUSIC OF NATURE.
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank !
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
Creep in our ears ; soft stillness and the night
Become the touches of sweet harmony.
Sit, lov'd one ; look how the floor of heaven
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold.
There's not the smallest orb, which thou behold'st,
But in his motion like an angel sings,
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubim ;
Such harmony is in immortal souls ;
But, whilst this muddy vesture of decay
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.

ideas by oral arbitrary sounds, or written signs ; imparts fa
cility in composition, and powers of rhetoric and oratory,
fluency in conversation and debate.
Uses—
to communicate knowledge and promote sociability.
Abuses—
garrulity, gossipping, and scandalizing.
Location—

combined with the purest moral sentiments, gave its posses
sor wisdom, sagacity, and judgment of the highest order, con
trasted with skull of Carib, (46*.) Washington in his life exhi
bited those great and good qualities so harmoniously blended,
that by common consent he is placed at the head of great and
estimable men.
Tjses—
to discover and apply truths by analogy, force of rea
son ; ability to investigate, to discover good from evil, truth
from error, &c.
82
The whole range of the mental and physical world are sub
jected to this analyzing, scrutinizing, intellectual, thinking
principle, by which man is elevated infinitely above all other
beings,[contrasted with outlines of animality, 47, 48, 49, 50, in
which may be comprised nearly the whole of animal or infe
rior heads, from frog to orang.] This reasoning faculty leads
man to investigate the phenomena and wonders of the uni
verse, and animated nature,
"
and so through nature up to
nature's God."
Uses—
to reason analogically; to compare closely; to reason
a
priori, (from a prior cause.)
Abuse—
abstract intensity of thought, to the neglect of reli
gious or temporal duties.
Location—
it is situated in the highest part of the middle of
the forehead.

See what a grace was seated on this brow—
Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself:
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command ;
Astation like the herald Mercury,

A combination, and a form, indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man.
35—CAUSALITY.
Very Large—
Great originality of thought, powers of invention.
Large—
Energetic and active habits of mind; ability of analyzing.
Full—
Disposition for inquiry, but incapable of profound thought.
Moderate—
Indifference to metaphysics ; little or no inquisitiveness.
Small—
Deficient in reasoning power, and weakness of intellect.
Causality implies the desire to ascertain, why, wherefore is
this so ? „
This organ is very obvious in the head annexed of
the great American philosopher, Franklin, (cut 51,) to whose
profound spirit of enquiry the whole world is deeply indebted
for some of the most valuable and important truths in natural
philosophy. It was this great philosophical spirit which sus
tained him, a wandering boy, with his roll of gingerbread
under his arm, and which subsequently enabled him to perse
vere till he brought the lightning within his grasp, and ren
dered it subservient to the use of man.

THE TEMPERAMENTS.
Physiologists have laid down the following rules in forming
a judgment of the temperament from the external appearance
of the individual, which are described as follows:
THE LYMPHATIC is distinguished by a roundness of
person, fair hair and skin, delicate texture of body, and soft
ness of the muscles, inactivity of the brain and nervous system.
THE SANGUINE temperament is indicated by fulness of
person and firmness of muscle, bright chesnut hair, ruddy
countenance, and regular features ; fond also of animated and
active exertion.
THE BILIOUS temperament is recognized by full, dark
hair, angular outlines of form, firmness of texture; also by
strength and energy of person ; the features acute and strongly
defined.
THE NERVOUS temperament is distinguished by rapidity
of motion for a short period ; small muscles and thin, fine hair:
easily becomes fatigued, and very susceptible.
When comparing different brains, the temperament should
always be attended to; because two brains may be of the
same size, but if one be of the lymphatic, and the other of the
bilious temperament, there will be great difference in the
powers of manifesting the faculties.
'
In referring man's ac
tions to his cerebral structure, we must admit the great impor
tance of his organic constitution or structure, as this is one of
the first and most important conditions to be observed in esti
mating his phrenological character. We can readily conceive
how the organic constitution of the brain is affected and modi
fied by the digestion, circulation, perspiration, and nutrition
of the body, and how these different states of organization may
produce different degrees of activity of the mental faculties
generally.
87
The size of Brain, other conditions being equal, is the measure of
power, either in the aggregate or as exhibited in detail by means of the
written figures in this book, which, as before stated, are intended to ex
press the relative size or force of each particular organ or faculty.
» VERY LARGE..—A person having a Head or Brain marked very
large, with activity also very large, with a favorable temperament,
good education and opportunities, will exhibit the very highest order of
talents and vigor of intellect, will be a natural genius and possess an apti
tude for almost any pursuit or
profession, and calculated to make a figure
in the world. He will, by the mere force of his natural genius, be enabled
to overcome difficulties which would be insurmountable to persons of
smaller heads and ordinary talents ; such an one will shine like a
bright
and particular star in Hie firmament of intellectual greatness, upon which
future ages may gaze with astonishment and delight. His mental capa
city will grasp the highest, the noblest, and the most sublime conceptions
of happiness and virtue ; his feelings will be of the most exquisite sensi
bility, either for pleasure or pain. With activity large, he will be en
dowed with a
very high order of talents and very superior powers of mind
and vigorous intellect, enabled to make a distinguished figure amongst
even great men, and be a
leading, prominent character in whatever sphere
he may be engaged. With activity full, on
great occasions, or when
thoroughly aroused, he would be truly great ; but upon ordinary occasions
he would not manifest those traits of character which would distinguish
him from the generality of mankind.
LARGE. —
One having a
large-sized Brain, with activity large or
very large, will possess great power of mind, and exercise a command
ing influence over those with whom he may come in contact. He will
possess great ardor and impetuosity, and in some points be irresistible,
particularly should his propelling powers and selfish passions be strong.
With the practical intellect large, he would excel in business, and pos
sess a ready intuitive knowledge of everything, and be highly successful
in his profession or business. With activity full, he would be endowed
with a great share of mental capacity, but require stimulus to exertion and
thoroughly arouse him to those vigorous efforts of mind, of which he is
under some circumstances capable ; when not excited, he would pass for
an ordinary person. With deficiency of the perceptive and reflective fac
ulties, would not be very shrewd or
apt, but rather inferior in judgment
and capacity ; but with large propelling or animal feelings, might exhibit
a great degree of misapplied energy, and a great wish to excel, but not the
capacity. With activity moderate, when powerfully excited, may evince
considerable energy of intellect and capacity for performance, yet be too
indolent and sluggish to do much ; wanting also in clearness of ideas and
intensity of feeling, and unless driven to exertion, will not be likely to ac
complish much. With activity small, or very small, an extreme aver
sion to action, indolent and incapable of great exertion, either mentally or
sically.
ULL. —
With activity great, or very great, and the practical intel
lect and propelling powers large, or very large, although not possess
ing a high order of talent, will be generally clever, have considerable tal
ent, and that so
energetic, that it will pass current for more than what it
really is worth, from its great incentive to action, yet is inadequate for
great undertakings, and incapable of making a distinguished figure in the
n
88
world, nor be really great. With activity full, will be tolerably clever,
but manifest only an ordinary share of intellect. With the intellectual
and perceptive faculties large, he would be enabled to conduct business
of an
ordinary character, and even to obtain some celebrity and pass for a
talented man. With activity moderate, will be indisposed to action, and
take the world easy. Small, or very small, will be extremely deficient
in everything that constitutes a great character.
MODERATE. —
One with a Head of only moderate size, combined
with great or very great activity and large perceptive and propelling
powers, will appear to possess much more talent than he really does, and
with others to pioneer for him, he may be enabled to follow their plans
with advantage. He will be more remarkable for activity than strength
of mind, and more
showy than useful in his acquirements. With activity
only full, will have but a very moderate amount of intelligence, and no
desire to acquire a great reputation; very sluggish and inactive. With
activity moderate, or small, extremely dull of apprehension and exces
sively indolent.
SMALL, OR VERY SMALL.—One with a small or very small
Head, will be conscious of little else than merely an animal existence, and
can never
accomplish those high and splendid achievements which have
immortalized the names of Homer, a Milton, or Shakespeare, or of the
super-eminent goodness or greatness of an Alfred, or a Washington, who,
generously resigning every consideration of self for the advancement of
their country's happiness and welfare, have left their names an
enduring
monument to all ages.
THE DEGREE OF ACTIVITY.—Whilst size gives power, momen
tum and endurance of the mental faculties, &c, activity imparts intensity,
quickness, willingness, and even a restless desire to act ; implying energy
and efficiency of character in the same ratio as marked in the margin.
The Brain is divided into two halves or hemispheres, each hemisphere
being composed of a number of folds or convolutions, each of which has
been discovered and unfolded by Spurzheim's new and admirable method
of dissecting the Brain. The functions of each have also been fully estab
lished by the unwearied and indefatigable personal observation of the
immortal Drs. Gall and Spurzheim, first founders of the science, and since
corroborated by innumerable practical observations of its numerous pro
fessors, both in this country and Europe. The two
hemispheres ofthe
Brain are brought into communication and simultaneous action by means
of fibres running transversely from one to the other. This important fact
was first established by the extremely delicate method of unravelling the
Brain, as
practised by Spurzheim. The Skull, or
bony outside covering to
the Brain, -and its three distinct coverings by which it is enveloped, gene
rally presents a perfect parallelism to the Brain, as it is moulded on the
Brain, and may be regarded as a kind of shell-work, as it presents no
more obstruction to the growth and development of the Brain, than does
the shell to the growth of such animals as are protected by them ; the
bony structure being of a
secondary formation to that of the Brain or softer
parts of the human system.
89
THE HUMAN BRAIN
21
Upper View of Brain.
90
The preceding cuts are correct representations of the upper and
lower view of various parts about the base of the brain of an adult
intellectual person.
The brain is divided into two halves, or hemispheres, each of
which are united by means of minute filaments or thread-like sub
stances, embedded in cortical and medullary matter, radiating in
various
"
directions, crossing each other, communicating the two
hemispheres of the brain, the Medulla Oblongata, the Medulla Spi-
nallis, the various organs of sense, and all parts of the body.
The intercommunication of these remote nervous filaments with
those in the brain is instantaneous. The nerves of volition and
sensation act in the same manner.
The singular and extraordinary effects of electricity and galvan
ism on the human body, animate or inanimate, point to this subtle
fluid as entering largely into the animal economy, the nerves ap
pearing to act as the conductors of electricity, which moves with a
velocity of two hundred thousand miles per second, or about the
same velocity as light.
The brain proper is called the cerebrum, and the smaller brain
the cerebelum. The former is much more voluminous and various
in its form, structure, and functions, and wherein are located the
organs of the various passions, intellect and sentiments ; the smaller
brain, or cerebelum, being solely the organ of physical love, and
gives rise to the feeling of Amativeness, although it has recently
been conjectured it is also the seat of the organ of voluntary motion
The brain is protected by three distinct membranes or coverings,
in which it is enveloped. The first is the pia mater, which closely
adheres to the surface of the brain, dipping into the sulci, or cavi
ties, and conveying innumerable blood-vessels to it. The second is
named the tunica arachnoida, resembling a
spider's web in fineness.
It secretes a fluid to lubricate the pia mater and the dura mater, or
third covering, which is attached to the brain, and also adheres to
the inner surface of the skull.
The skull is curiously formed of eight separate bones—
one
frontal, two parietal, two temporal, one occipital, one
sphenoidal, and
one ethmoidal—
each united by sutures or seams. The growth of
these bones is each of them independent of the other, and com
mences growing from its own centre, and in old age firmly intersect
each other by means of curious dove-tailed seams, which are much
more serrated in the Caucassian skulls than the Carib, and still more
simple in animals, &c.
The formation of the skull may be regarded as an excrescence,
or shelly covering, of a
secondary growth, (as seen in children.) It
is designed for protection to the brain, and not to impede its growth,
as some appear erroneously to imagine.
91
Previous to the anatomical researches of the founders of this
science, the brain was supposed to be merely the root from whence
originated the whole nervous apparatus which proceed from it to
every part of the human structure, which led many distinguished
anatomists and philosophers to conjecture that the brain was in
some measure the sensorium, or seat of the intellectual powers ;
but nothing definite was known of its structure or functions until
the discoveries of Drs. Gall and Spurzheim.
Our limits will not permit us here to show the singular corre
spondence of the mind, &c, with this its instrument, not only in the
human family, but to the lowest order of being. The complication
of structure, and large size or volume in man, orang, &c, is won
derfully contrasted with the smallness of volume and extreme sim
plicity of structure in the lower order of animals, reptiles, &c, being
in the latter reduced to a mere point or particle of gelatinous matter,
entirely destitute of convolutions, or
appendages of nerves, &c, as
we find in the higher order of beings.
To those desirous of pursuing this study in detail, we have much
pleasure in recommending the splendid work of Spurzheim on the
Anatomy of the Brain.
FOUR DIVISIONS OF THE HEAD.
The cut No. 59, with the line perpendicular from the ear, e to a,
represents the anterior and posterior portion of brain, and the line
through the eye and ear represents the base or foundation of brain
by which we can estimate the proportion of brain to the whole head
or face inclusive. The line from the nose to forehead gives the
facial angle. The line from C to B divides the sincipital from the
occipital region, the portion above being peculiar only to man, in
cluding the intellectual and sentimental or controlling organs
—
the
portion below being the propelling or selfish propensities, which are
common to man and the lower animals.
92
FOUNDATION OF PHRENOLOGY.
Phrenology is a derivation from the Greek, phren and logos, or
the science of mind. This compound word is the adoption of Dr.
Spurzheim, the distinguished associate of Dr. Gall. To the latter
belongs the high honor of being the first to discover this new science
of mind, or, in other words, the mode of ascertaining man's peculiar
innate talents and original powers of mind by a reference to his
cerebral organization, or form and volume of brain. Like most
other exact sciences, it has been of slow progress, and has not been
rashly adopted, but is the result of a most laborious, patient, and
minute investigation of the human cerebral structure, in its endless
and interesting varieties, both in states of perfect health and every
stage of the various diseases to which we are subject. The human
brain—
that gordion knot, which has puzzled the sages of ancient
and modern times, and which they could only untie by cutting—
has
now, for the first time, been completely unravelled, and its most
wonderful beauty, complication of structure, and harmonious adap
tation to its functions, been laid open by the labors of these distin
guished physicians and philosophers.
Further ; in order to satisfy the most incredulous, they have
carried their indefatigable researches to those minute points in crea
tion, or most simplified of animals and reptiles, and even to those
minute animalculse, the ephemeral existence of a day. The results
of their investigations of human and comparative Phrenology have
appeared in volumes of facts, sufficient to satisfy the most incredu
lous of the reality of this science, and of its high importance to the
happiness and well-being of man. Their united labors were indeed
conducted with singular ability, zeal, and enthusiasm, and which
have comparatively left little to their successors but further to estab
lish and confirm if possible their previous discoveries.
To the great Dr. Gall we owe the rude discovery of the science ;
and whilst as yet in its incipient stages of existence, he had both in
correctly named the doctrine itself and also several of its most im
portant functions. This resulted, in a great measure, from the fact
of his having discovered the several organs when in an excessive
state of development, or as manifested in their abuses. As an in
stance, from the comparison of the heads of notorious, incorrigible
thieves, although there might be many dissimilar forms of heads,
yet in this one particular region of 'Acquisitiveness he found a very
great enlargement. It was this fact which led him erroneously to
suppose a particular faculty or organ of stealing. This was also
precisely the case from an examination of the heads of murderers,
by discovering the organ of Destructiveness enormously developed,
and which he incorrectly named the organ of murder. On this ac
count a stigma has attached to the science, which its opponents
93
have made great use of. The science itself also was
incorrectly
named by Dr. Gall, being that of Cranioscopy, or
Craniology.
We must here take this opportunity of observing, that none of the
faculties, as discovered and located by Dr. Gall, have been ever
materially changed. It is to the philosophic spirit of inquiry, and
severe mode of inductive reasoning, united to the anatomical dis
coveries of the accomplished Spurzheim, that we owe its present
correct classification and nomenclature.
APPLICATION AND UTILITY OF PHRENOLOGY.
Phkenolo&y is the only science of mind susceptible of actual
demonstration, and is the only true philosophy of mental action.
It is a powerful support to morality and religion. It is the only ra
tional and true basis of education. It is the foundation of domestic
happiness. It is a most powerful auxiliary in the cause of morality,
religion, virtue, and of education. It not only teaches us to know
ourselves, but it goes a step farther, and teaches us to know others
also. Its principles and practice are invaluable in jurisprudence,
civil and criminal. By referring man's intellectual and sentimental
innate character to his organization, it strongly appeals to our char
itable sympathies to make allowances for the imperfections of
others, and to lay no more upon individuals than they can bear. It
also teaches us to desist from the mad attempts which have been
made to reduce the talents and opinions of all to one standard.
Bell and many other distinguished physiologists and metaphysi
cians have admitted that the mind manifests a plurality of faculties.
The discovery that it employs the brain as its agent, was left to
immortalize Dr. Gall.
"
Size of the brain, other conditions being equal, is a measure of
power." This proposition is supported by analogy throughout
nature, and by observation. The conditions to be observed are,
1st, Temperament ; 2d, Age ; 3d, Health ; and 4th, Exercise. Phre
nologists contend that if these conditions are equal in two individu
als, the one possessed of the largest organs will manifest superior
powers of mind. These conditions should be kept in view, also,
when comparing different compartments of the brain ; for one indi
vidual may have a smaller brain than another, and yet manifest the
greatest amount of intellectual power. This will be seen to arise
from the small brain being endowed with a larger intellectual lobe
than the larger brain. But here the conditions vary, and the judg
ment of the two heads must vary accordingly.
The form and size of the brain, and each of its divisions, may be
ascertained to a mathematical, actual certainty, from the external
appearance of the head—
while the health, &c, can be easily deter
mined by other external indications.
94
ON PHYSIOGNOMY.
DEDICATED TO THE LADIES.
In order to invest this subject with more interest, each of
the passions, sentiments and intellect are described in verse,
in order to exercise the higher order of faculties, also to render
their action and influence on the character more conspicuous
and the more easily retained in the memory. The author
hopes he has also added to the attraction of this very interest
ing subject, by describing the various emotions of the mind,
as transitorily depicted on the countenance, and which, un
doubtedly, if long or
habitually indulged in, permanently leaves
its impress there; from which, no doubt, persons largely
endowed with the perceptive faculties, are enabled to form a
very correct estimate of the leading passions by a close obser
vance of the features. Hence we conceive the science of
Physiognomy has originated, and which is undoubtedly the
key to the leading passions and feelings of individuals. We
are, however, far from supposing it can be reduced to any sys
tematic mode of investigating character. From its wonderful
and beautiful mobility and ever-changing expression and vari
ableness, it may be compared to the fleeting summer cloud—
Now lighted up with heavenly azure brightness,
Anon dark, driving clouds and tempests lower,
And sheeted lightnings rend earth's fairest flowers,
And ruin stalks abroad to desolate the land :
So most wondrous beauty (the more 's the pity,)
May be transformed, with vengeful ire,
To frightful rage and horrible distortion—
Dread foes to peace, to friendship, and to love.
There is one singular fact, important to the ladies, particularly
those who are desirous of preserving unimpaired the beauty
with which heaven has favored them : it may not be uninter
esting to learn, that public speakers and many others have
declared that by certain expressions of the features the corres
ponding emotions of the mind are produced with a vivid in
tensity. This probably proceeds from the nerves, muscles, &c.
which connect certain parts of the brain with corresponding
parts of the face ; so that ladies who wish to preserve this
precious gem, their beauty, must ever indulge in the kind and
gentler emotions, and avoid all irritation, both of look and
feeling, as they would the Scylla and Charybdis, or the wreck
of beauty and loveliness.
95
IMPORTANT TO MOTHERS.
Phrenology teaches us that the brain is the organ of the mind, and
also that the mind is not an innate or distinct single power, and capable
of acting in every direction alike, and with equal force and intensity, but
that it is multiplex in its operations, and is composed of a number of dis
tinct organs or faculties, each organ being the name of a certain portion of
brain, which organ is estimated by its size or volume (other conditions
being equal.) Thus, the size of brain in the anterior and superior portion
of the forehead of the individual is the measure of his intellectual capacity.
The height of the head, or fulness in the coronal portion, indicates the
strength of the moral and selfish sentiments ; whilst the width of head
gives us the estimate of his animal or selfish propensities. It will be
seen by this classification, that Man possesses a Moral, an Intellectual,
and an Animal Nature, each acting in concert and producing an harmoni
ous whole, where each of these are
properly balanced, as in the most per
fect form of heads. Should the numbers range highest in the animal or
selfish propensities, it must be inferred that the individual is mostly influ
enced by the lower or animal feelings, although more or less modified
according to their relative proportions by the organs of intellect and senti
ment. In the absence of the animal portion, the individual lacks energy
and
power. The general form of the head determines the character of
the individual, and not particular bumps or
depressions, as
erroneously
imagined.
In forming an estimate of character, it must be remembered there are
several highly important conditions to be considered, which have great in
fluence in the formation of character—
the temperaments, education, cir
cumstances, and habits of the individual. The purely lymphatic is the
very least disposed for action, with great lack of energy in the brain and
nervous system. With regard to their culture, or exercise of the organs,
persons having had the advantages of a superior education, would exhibit
a much greater degree of intelligence or sagacity than persons without
those advantages, but whose heads should be precisely alike in every other
particular of size, configuration, &c. Thus, again, men are much influ
enced by circumstances, and which most materially modify the character,
and which will also unquestionably alter the configuration of brain or
head by any course of conduct or study long and pertinaciously persisted
in. It may be seen that children of superior or
highly endowed persons
will not only possess the exact form of head of one or both parents, but
will also, from early habitudes, become almost counterparts of one or other
of the parents ; and under those favorable circumstances, such children
are from the earliest infancy under a course of judicious mental cultiva
tion, which, apart from all natural high endowments as to the form of
crania, &c, must exert an influence on the future character, which would
be almost incalculable for good. The very reverse of this is also precisely
the case where low and dissolute persons have children under their con
trol, and, it may be added, mismanagement. From such unfortunate as
sociations the worst consequences may be apprehended, even with natural
capacities of the highest order, and the finest form of crania. Children
and persons with such associations would be more or less demoralized.
The science is in this respect of such an immense value, it learns us that
the formation of character of children, youth, &c, depends very materially
on ourselves ; for it must be observed, that the system ofeducation, either for
96
good or evil, commences almost in the cradle ; and the influence of the mother
on the formation of character is too much overlooked, and its importance
too much lost sight of. The elegant but superficial acquirements which
at present too much usurp the attention of young ladies, might in some
measure be discarded, and the science of Phrenology, Physiology, &c, be
substituted in their place, in order the more perfectly to quality them to
Eerform aright those high and important duties which, as mothers and the
eads of families, usually devolve on them. It might be added, however,
that American and European ladies, particularly in the higher circles, are
many of them distinguished for their varied and highly useful scientific
attainments, clearly proving, in many branches, nothing inferior to the
boasted superiority of the male sex.
It has been aptly remarked, by Napoleon, that no great man ever had a
weak mother; and! undoubtedly his judgment was perfectly correct in as
signing to the maternal side the greatest influence on the formation of
character. On her alone hang the destinies of this republic, for children are
almost the creatures of an intelligent mother's will. The phrenologist, in
giving his estimate of character, will not, of course, be generally aware of
all these foregoing important conditions, which so obviously and very ma
terially affect the character. It must, therefore, be conceded that there
are
peculiarities of character, which
legitimately do not come under the
cognizance of this science, and f°r which due allowance will be made by
the candid inquirer after truth. It is the paramount object of the science
to point out particular excellencies and aptitudes of character, or the
natural talents and disposition, also to point out defects, and to
apply its
proper corrective, by cultivating and exercising its antagonist faculties or
opposing forces. Probably no condition is so necessary for the perfect
possession of our faculties, and enjoying them in their highest degree of
perfection, than a
perfectly sound state of health, a compact and vigorous
constitution, and energetic physical powers. Indeed, this is a considera
tion which has been so entirely overlooked, and the inference naturally
drawn from it, that without a
healthy physical organization, it is in vain
to expect a vigorous, clear, and healthy exhibition of the mental powers.
Many have yet to learn that man, however great his intellectual powers
may be, can no more with impunity overtask the organs by which hi exer
cises his intellectual powers, or sustain consecutive action of thinking for
forty-eight hours without intermission, than can an individual exercise his
physical or muscular energies for the same
space of time, without great
consequent loss of energy and exhaustion, alike injurious in both cases,
and probably the delicate organ of the mind would be the greatest sufferer.
Indeed, we have so many corroborations of this, in the premature deaths
of so many bright and precocious geniuses, who have fallen early victims
to over-exertion of the mental faculties in early infancy, we are in
bounden duty compelled to caution all who have the charge of infants, or
very young children, to be extremely careful not to over-task the tender
and delicate organs of the mind. It would be extremely absurd to expect
them to exhibit extraordinary mental acquirements, or
very great physical
energy, before their brain or physical structure has attained a
perfect form
and consistency. The first consideration ought to be the establishing a
sound and vigorous constitution, as on this will greatly depend their future
happiness aad welfare, and which an affectionate mother only can duly
estimate.
97
UNDENIABLE PROOFS OF PHRENOLOGY.
Phrenology has been established and rests its claims to support
solely by an
appeal to facts, by actual demonstration and by induc
tion. This rigid mode of establishing the science invariably leads
to the conviction, that,
I. "We have no evidence of thought or mind without brain : we
therefore affirm it to be the organ of the mind, or the instrument
and modus operandi by which the intelligent principle carries on its
operations.
2. Because, by anatomical researches, we invariably discover, in
the endless chain of beings, the brains of men and animals to be
precisely in accordance with the various peculiarities, dispositions,
and talents they are known to possess. In men only of superior
formed heads do we find large cerebral masses or volume of brain
in the forehead or frontal, also in the coronal or superior portion,
giving an innate feeling of justice, veneration, and charity, also the
peculiar aptitude for poetry, painting, mechanism, and metaphysics,
combining the highest order of intellectual pursuits.
3. Because in men we find an infinitely greater diversity of forms
of head or brain than in any other created beings, of the same spe
cies, v/hatever. In man, also, we find an infinitely greater diver
sity of talents, sentiments, and feelings, singularly corroborative of
the phrenological analysis of his nature.
4. Idiocy is incontrovertibly proved to result from a deficiency of
the intellectual organs, or from disease of that particular portion of
brain, the forehead. Partial insanity, or mental hallucination upon
some subjects only, is ascertained, by post mortem examinations, to
be the effect of either external or internal injuries of those portions
of brain only which are affected. Dreaming also results from im
perfect sleep ; those portions of the brain in this case retaining a
degree of consciousness, by which we afterwards recall some of
these impressions. Perfect sleep being perfect unconsciousness,
man, in this state* closely resembles vegetative existence.
5. Because the heads of infants and adults are both extremely
dissimilar, and both strikingly illustrative of their characters. The
very differently formed heads of the opposite sexes, but of the same
variety or even family, are always in accordance with their various
known characteristics.
6. The hereditary transmission of family peculiarities, talents,
and dispositions, are in some cases strikingly singular, and can be
accounted for on no other than the phrenological principle, or the
correspondence and similarity of organization of the brain, form,
and features—" the like producing its kind." Human action is
clearly referable to organization*, "modified by circumstances,
98
temperament, and education. Human conduct is totally inexplica-
ble upon any others of the numerous hypotheses of mental and
moral philosophy which the ingenuity of men have been fabricating
since the world began ; and of them it may be said, before the pro
gressive, onward march of this science of facts, they are
"Like the baseless fabric of a vision,
Dissolving, leaving not a wreck behind."
The tender infant, when first ushered into the world, with the finest
formed head, or the finest formed legs, is alike incapable of either
thinking or walking, from the want of strength and consistency, or
maturity and perfection of the members or functions by which these
operations are performed.
It is only in the full maturity and perfection of our physical being
that we are enabled to exhibit our highest or happiest intellectual
efforts, or the greatest amount of physical energies.
The disease, decay, and gradual extinction of animal and intel
lectual powers appear the natural concomitants of extreme old age ;
this period presenting the melancholy spectacle of the tottering, im
becile, and weak old man—
a perfect wreck both of body and mind.
The great poet and pet of nature so beautifully illustrates these
different periods of man's existence, that we must beg to quote him.
"
At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms ;
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school ; and then the lover,
Sighing like furnace with a woful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow ; then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth ; and then the justice,
In fair, round belly, with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances.
And so he plays his part : the sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side,
His youthful hose well-served, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice
Turning again toward childish treble pipes,
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange, eventful history,
Is second childishness, and mere oblivion—
Sans teeth, sans
eyes, sans taste, sans everything."
Concussions on the brain produce insensibility in a greater or less
degree, proportionate to the injury sustained. The various degrees
of intoxication are also productive of a corresponding degree ot
99
mental imbecility, amounting, in extreme cases, to total insensi
bility. This is clearly referable to the combined effects of the rush
of deleterious gases to the brain, generated by the chemical action
of this liquid fire, or alcohol, on the contents of the stomach, also
from the repletion of all the vessels, particularly of the brain, thus
producing a
greater or less degree of inflammation or disease of this
organ of the mind. Deleterious or noxious gases inhaled into the
brain produce effects on the mind analogous to their character.
The first stages of inebriation and the effects of "
laughing gas" are
very similar. Hypochondriacism, loss of children and lovers, or
the frustration of any long-cherished passion, react frequently with
a fearful energy on the whole animal economy, producing insanity,
disease, and even death. Excessive mental agitation, intemperance,
or excesses in any form, are therefore as
prejudicial to the mind as
body, and ought to be most sedulously avoided by those who wish
to preserve their bodily and mental vigor unimpaired.
Cheerfulness and good temper are
highly conducive to health ;
and happy are those who can
preserve unruffled their equanimity
under privations and disappointments. Grief, unmanly grief, ought
to be beneath the dignity of proud, aspiring man : for
"
Every grief but adds a nail to our coffin, there 's no doubt,
Whilst every laugh so merry draws one out."
HARMONY OF SCRIPTURE WITH PHRENOLOGY.
The coming of the Messiah was a remarkable advent in the his
tory of the world. Of him only it may be said,
"
He spake as never
man spake ;" and whose life, actions, and words are a true exem
plification of Phrenology, and in precise accordance with its princi
ples as a guide to human action. This affords at once one of the
most conclusive evidences of the divinity of our Saviour, exhibiting
in his God-like life those divine attributes of Christian charity, love,
and forgiveness, which were so singularly contrasted with the bloody
and barbarous .
Jews of that period, and indeed we may say of the
whole world which, of that period of time, from the dreadful and
exterminating wars which the most enlightened nations were
waging against each other, had converted human beings into mon
sters, and this smiling world into one vast arena of blood and
slaughter, wherein whole nations were oftentimes found extermi
nating each other, without regard to age, sex, or condition ; thus
surpassing in ferocity even the lowest orders of brute creation, who
but rarely war with their own kind.
One of the most touching, affecting, and beautiful illustrations of
character, found on record, ancient or modern, is that of the termina
tion of the Saviour's sufferings. When under the excruciating
100
pains of a violent and ignominious death, his divine exclamation
was, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do!"
Again ; his golden rule, which comprises nearly all which a Chris
tian or a
philanthropist can require, viz.,
"
Do unto others as
ye
would that others should do unto you," for thereby hangs all the
law and the prophets. This beautiful exposition of moral conduct
in man could only result in an entire knowledge of the capacities of
man, and as peculiarly adapted to his state of being in that era,
and also to future ages when man shall have acquired his highest
degree of perfection, virtue, and happiness.
These evidences of the divinity of the Saviour proclaim aloud that
"
peace on earth and good will towards man
"
was the paramount
object in view in his mission on earth. These beneficent views are
singularly in accordance with the relative and social duties of man,
as inculcated by the correct exposition of the phrenological doc
trines when applied to the government of man in society, or in his
individual capacity. This leads us to consider
"THE MORAL APPLICATION OF PHRENOLOGY."
In teaching the supremacy of the moral sentiments, it leads us
invariably previous to action to ascertain "
what is right," by an appeal
to those monitors, Conscientiousness and Benevolence, which can
not lie, (although we believe various persons are differently consti
tuted as to their acute perceptions of right and wrong, for instance
as in the case of idiots, imbeciles, &c. ;) we touch probably the most
delicate ground on which the science stands ; as by referring man's
actions in a great measure to his organization, or as a consequence
of his perfect or imperfect cerebral organization, or form of head,
it has, we are aware, been considered by some most conscientious
philanthropists and Christians as highly objectionable, as removing
man's accountability for his actions to his Creator, and involving
the dangerous doctrines of materialism and fatalism. But to the
candid and unprejudiced observer it must be admitted we are de
pendent on our organization in some measure. We conceive this
result is perfectly in accordance with divine revelation, which em
phatically declares that to every man hath been given various
degrees of talents—
to one man was given one talent, to another
ten, &c.—
and that every man shall be judged according to his
works, or the talents thus bestowed on him. Now does not this
distinctly imply that human beings are differently constituted, and
have as many and as various degrees of talent and temper as is
compatible with the divine intentions of man's creation and his pre
sent existence ?
Common observation strongly confirms this scriptural definition,
101
inasmuch as it will be apparent to any who will investigate the
matter that men are as
differently endowed, both in their moral,
physical, and intellectual character, as can well be conceived ; inas
much as we find some who would endure the most terrible priva
tions, ay, even death itself probably, rather than to steal or
murder;
whilst we also do know that many unfortunates are the continual
occupants of prisons, hospitals for the insane, &c, from either a
defective organization, in a greater measure to be attributed to
defective education, and partly possibly from the injudicious modes
of punishments heretofore adopted for the avowed objects both of
punishing and of prevention of crimes by example. Now, as to the
infliction of unmerited punishments, we only indulge in the animal
feelings in inflicting pain on
others, and it is at best calculated only
to irritate and harden the worst of criminals, and has a
tendency to
degrade the novice in crime to the level of the most abandoned, and
lower him in the estimation of himself and others. As to the pre
vention, by the terrors of example, and punishment of crime in
others, it is of a very doubtful expediency at the best ; and regarded
in the worst light, it outrages the moral sentiments of benevolence
and conscientiousness, "in doing a positive evil, in the bare and
very remote possibility that good may come of it." Hitherto it
appears to have been more the object of men to invent punishments
for crime, than to use any efforts in order to its preventton. This
we conceive is the great error of all legislation without Phrenology.
It is hoped this digression will lead the seekers of truth from
Phrenology to well weigh these considerations, as they involve
questions of the highest import to the whole community, families
and individuals.
The friends of the science are very sanguine in the hope, that
great good will result from its general adoption in all public and
private institutions, particularly of education, reformation, and
mental culture, as by means of it great assistance may be rendered
by its application as a powerful auxiliary in the noble cause of hu
man elevation and improvement, both of national and individual
character.
This is a science which perhaps has been more misunderstood
and misrepresented than any other. Some have ignorantly, many
wilfully, perverted its meaning and objects by levelling their shafts
of ridicule and sarcasm, under the cognomen of "bumpology," &c.
Now it is true there may be occasionally bumps on the head, and
there may be also depressions, but these are scarcely of any impor
tance whatever in estimating the character ; and when we
say that
many of the finest heads are entirely destitute of them, we shall
perhaps astonish some whose heads may be highly embellished in
this way, and who may suppose they have a strongly marked char
acter, when probably they have one considerably below par.
102
CHOICE IN MARRIAGE.
THE PLEASURES OF MATRIMONY AND WOMAN'S RIGHTS PHRENOLOOI-
CALLY ANALYZED.
By adopting the science of Phrenology as the rule of moral con
duct, we must be guided by a reference to the constitutional organi
zation, and particularly the formation of the brain. It will be seen
by a reference to its structure, (p. 89,) that the organ of Amative
ness, or that portion which gives rise to the sexual feeling, alone
occupies nearly one-third of the whole volume of the base of the
brain, in addition to which the organs of Philoprogenitiveness, Ad
hesiveness, and Inhabitiveness are immediately above it, from
which it may be inferred how large a portion of the brain is devoted
to the social feelings, or those comprised in the domestic group.
In a phrenological analysis of character, we always assume the
larger organs to control the smaller ; consequently, the immense
strength of these organs will be inferred, and their power on the
character of an individual, for good or ill. Tn order to afford them
every legitimate gratification, (for we cannot entirely suppress these
feelings, neither ought we so to do,) we ought to be acquainted with
their tendencies, their uses and abuses, and the mode of directing
them, and this can
only be properly effected by a close analysis of
their various functions, as revealed to us by Phrenology, Physio
logy, &c.
By such an analysis we are led to the conviction that man is pre
eminently endowed a social being, or is wholly formed for society ;
also, that a state of solitude to him is a state of positive pain, pre
cisely in proportion to the strength or
development and volume of
these organs, with the other portions of the brain. The relative
proportions of these organs in the different sexes, with the differ
ences in civilized and barbarous men, and the organs which control
and direct them, may be seen by referring to the tables of admea
surements, as positive facts, which throw a flood of light on this
subject.
It may there be seen how much larger, proportionably, are those
organs which constitute spiritual love, as
Veneration, Adhesive
ness, &c, with love of offspring or children, in the female than in
the male heads ; whilst it may also be seen, that the simple feeling
of desire, or animal love, (Amativeness,) is larger in the male—
he
being impelled more by love for a woman, than the woman:
whilst the exact converse of this is true of the female, which, added
to her love of children, renders the marriage state so desirable to
woman in every point of view, and absolutely necessary to her
happiness.
103
Metaphysicians, who have argued the unlimited power of the
soul over the body, or that man can begin and carry through a
series of actions, independent of all cause and motive, we think
were entirely ignorant of natural laws, as revealed by the operations
• of these organs on the animal economy, as we conceive they are an
entire and complete refutation of such an
opinion. In illustration of
this view, we shall find the greatest and best of men have, at vari
ous times and in all ages, committed follies, and even crimes, under
the strong impulsive power of this passion of love. These pheno
mena are perfectly incredible on the supposition of their actions
being entirely independent of their organization. History furnishes
so many singular facts, illustrative of the strength of this passion,
in all ages and in all countries, that it has become a proverb, and it
would here be work of supererogation to enumerate them. Suffi
cient to say, the very wisest and best of persons who ever lived
have been, at some seasons, vanquished by this irresistible love.
One of the most instructive lessons for avoidance of this error, is
probably afforded us in the history of those pious and holy, but mis
taken men, who, imagining they were doing God service, have,
under strong religious excitements, vowed eternal celibacy, in order
to propitiate, as they erroneously imagine, the favor of Heaven, by
outraging one of the best and holiest feelings implanted in our
nature. The confessions of their tortures are almost appalling, and
make us blush for the ignorance of poor human nature, and the
J misconceptions of duty and religion men fall into when they aban
don nature for their guide. W)e can only regard such persons as
monomaniacs, whose ardent love of religion, (as they interpret it,)
has disordered their brain, or produced a morbid excitement of the
moral organs, and who erroneously conceive the animal organs are
their deadliest foes, because excesses have been committed when left
unrestrained, and they think to repress them altogether. By so
doing, they convert one of God's holy ordinances into a chimerical
and most horrible phantom ; and the impulse of this divine feeling
they have tortured into the temptations of the Evil One himself, in
resisting which they supposed they were
"
fighting the battles of the
Lord," to win for themselves a glorious immortality.
How profoundly ignorant are such persons of the physical and
organic laws which the truths of Phrenology are laying open to our
view ! This teaches us these organs of the propensities are among
the holiest and best when directed by the intellect and sentiment ;
and in illustration of this fact, it will be found those nations who
possess the highest or largest developments of the moral and intel
lectual faculties, are the most observant of their matrimonial ob
ligations, and cherish these as the choicest boon from Heaven to
man. Matrimony is also an institution of God himself, and by
» which woman is placed more nearly on a level with the boasted
104
"
lords of the creation ;" for, amongst savages of all nations, she
is treated as the slave of his passions and caprices, and from the
degradation in which she is held by her brute tyrant-master, her
whole being becomes deformed and deteriorated. Travellers fre
quently, in describing the brutal and hideous appearance of these
savage men, sometimes inform us the women are still more repul
sive in their appearance. [See Appendix.] How strikingly is this
contrasted with woman here and in other highly civilized countries,
where they are usually distinguished no less for their physical than
their sentimental beauty. [See chapter on Physiognomy, also Ad
measurements.]
This unquestionably results, in a great measure, from the supe
rior respect and consideration shown them, which thus adds to their
beauty and goodness, whereby all the superior sentiments are called
into action. In this respect woman in this country may take prece
dence of all others, as woman here possesses greater freedom than
elsewhere.
By a phrenological analysis of woman's character, she is not yet,
we conceive, all she might be and is susceptible of realizing. We
think she ought to be, in
every respect, on a
perfect equality with
man, and every disability, political or otherwise, under which she
labors, ought to be removed. Many employments, from which
tyrant custom has excluded her, ought to be thrown open, and
where nature or inclination points the way let her be free to exer
cise her gifts.
It is by the diffusion of knowledge, particularly Phrenology, the
character of woman will be elevated and improved in the intellect
ual and physical organs. They are at present almost too much
debarred from free air and exercise. Something might be learned
from Physiology in this respect. We can conceive no reason why
ladies shoukl be entrusted with the very highest political power in
Europe, and yet be excluded from many other subordinate trusts
and employments. As the advocates of religion, temperance, mo
rality, and virtue, they are, and would be still more, their efficient
advocates and supporters.
But we are digressing. However men may differ in some re
spects on these points, all will be unanimous in the opinion that
women are eminently qualified by nature to render the home of
man literally "a little paradise" and home of the affections. How
much do we not owe to her superior, soft, attractive graces, or
higher sentimental character, [see Admeasurements,] in promoting
the love of home, virtue and happiness ! Indeed, no man can be
said to possess a home, without a woman to grace and adorn it, and
his happiness must necessarily be incomplete without her. Woman
can be the only sincere friend of man in the hour of need. Man
constitutionally cannot possibly feel that sympathy for man which

woman does, and no woman feels so deeply or so sensitively as the
wife of his affections, who, united to him by every endearing tie
of love, friendship, and family, sincerely sympathises in all his
joys and sorrows. If in life there is one feeling superior to all
others in extatic pleasure, it is when man turns from the cold, un
feeling world, to the bosom of his beloved one, and receives that
sympathy of love he looks in vain for elsewhere, and however the
storms of adversity may assail him without, he will find a haven and
safe anchorage within his sacred- home, lightening, if not removing
all that mischance or ill fortune can huddle on his back. When
thus cheered and invigorated by those be loves, he may bend, but
will not break under the pressure of misfortune, and the sweet part
ner of his affections and happiness cheers him on his way, and par
ticipates in his weal and woe.
all the good we pray for in this life,
Is to be bless'd with one sweet, loving, fond, confiding wife.
In order fully to attain this blessing, one of the first requisites in a
good wife is to "ascertain that she has a good head, and all other good
things will naturally follow, such as good temper, good health, good
nature, good feeling, and, above all, good children, particularly if
you yourself are also good. But, above all, in the choice of a wife,
let sincere affection and real esteem be your guide. This will prove
the greatest happiness of life, your lasting comfort, and a source of
perpetual bliss.
Marriage, with love, is like a beauteous
Fountain of perpetual, never-ending sweets:
Without love, it is the source of hateful fear,
Of discord, strife, and jealousies jpithout end.
As it would be impossible in our limited space here to do justice
to this very interesting subject, we will refer the reader to our small
pamphlet elucidating this subject, entitled "
The Way to get Mar
ried ; or Rules for a Happy Choice in Marriage," proving the ne
cessity, happiness, and utility of marriage, founded on Phrenology
and Physiology, natural and revealed religion, &c.
OF THE PHYSIOGNOMICAL CHARACTER OF MAN, AND
OF THE DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF THE
HUMAN FAMILY".
"
And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.
And God created man in his own image ; in the image of God created he
him, male and female created he them."
How ennobling to man this declaration of the Deity, by whom he
is thus declared to be endowed with divine beauty, immeasurably
108
Beyond every other creature whatever. He was to resemble the
Deity himself, the great and divine Author of all good.
Thus man, pure from the hands of his Maker, was endowed with
a degree of heavenly beauty and intelligence corresponding to his
state of innocence, happiness, and virtue. It will be interesting to
show how far he has lost that heavenly type of his divine Creator,
in a corresponding degree with his mental and physical degradation
and debasement, as exhibited in his history in the various regions
of the world. A brief outline of the most remarkable will be given
in the Appendix, for the illustration of these facts in detail.
The cuts appended are intended, imperfectly, to exhibit the pro
gressive scale of being, from the frog or reptile up to the classical
Grecian profile of Apollo Belvidere, from Lavater.
To the lover of nature, nothing offers a more delightful field for
study and observation than an acquaintance with himself* and his
own peculiar organization and functions, as expressive of the various
emotions, ideas, and sentiments of which we are susceptible.
Phrenology assigns the seat of every emotion and feeling as aris
ing in the brain, or the cerebral structure.
Physiognomy, on the contrary, assigns the features as the origin
of our various sensations, and to the countenance the manifestation
of mind, disposition, talents, &c.
Now, on comparing the merits of these respective theories, we
distinctly disclaim assigning to either of these instruments the origin
of our sensations. We consider them as
merely the instruments or
mode by which we are enabled both to receive and to communi
cate our impressions of the external world ; and in this view of the
question, we might suppose the great Author of our being has
created souls of different^ degrees of purity or loveliness, and as
signed to each their appropriate habitations of beauty or
deformity,
both internal and external ; for in our subsequent remarks (and
common observation establishes the fact) there is a remarkable cor
respondence and harmony between not only the brain and face, but
also in the whole of the organized structure, and we venture to say,
this will be seen by all who are the least sensitive to beauty, (and who
is not ?) We sometimes meet with those delightful persons whom
we are disposed almost to idolize at first sight, wholly from their
external appearance or
physiognomical expression, whilst we also
experience strong feelings of aversion to others, simply from unfa
vorable appearances. We doubt not but every man's countenance
is the index to his character, (not the cause of it,) were we but en
dowed with sufficient powers of discernment to read it. We have
ourselves invariably observed that where the destructive propensi
ties are very small, it is next to impossible for persons thus consti
tuted, strongly to "depict these passions by the countenance. So of
benevolence, &c. We also believe there are many exceptions, or
109
rather that many most noble natures are overthrown and prostrated
by the force of untoward circumstances, (and so
misunderstood,)
and the milk of human kindness turned to gall and bitterness.
As a further illustration of the truth of Physiognomy, let us com
pare the dog-like skull of the cannibal, (page 59,) and then read the
accompanying physiognomical description, and judge how nearly it
accords with the horribly repulsive character given of these worse
than savages, by various travellers.
To such descriptions it will only be necessary as a contrast, to
conjure to the mind's eye those form, of beauty and loveliness with
which he is most familiar and enamored ; or let him turn, in this
volume, to some of the imperfectly drawn sketches of American
beauties, Shakespeare, &c, and he must admit there is just as great
and striking a
dissimilarity in their phrenological developments
and physiognomical expression and appearance, as in their very
widely dissimilar and striking characteristics. [See tables of mea
sures.]
For our purpose it is not necessary to go into minute detail on
this subject, but let these strongly marked and diversified facts speak
for themselves, as there exhibited. This leads us to consider
THE ADVANTAGES OF A PHRENOLOGICAL AND PHY
SIOLOGICAL STUDY OF NATURE.
To a contemplative mind nothing offers so much to admire as the
physical organization and mechanism of man. We may well ex
claim with the Psalmist of old, "Lord, I am fearfully and wonder
fully made." Nothing, probably tends to awaken a sense of our
dependence on the divine Author of our being, more than an inves
tigation of our own organization, structure, and bodily functions.
Indeed, we think this as a branch of study ought to be paramount
to most others. More particularly is it of the highest importance to
the mothers of our country. We would ask, what earthly blessing
can equal that inestimable feeling of happiness we experience in the
enjoyment of a vigorous state of health. Indeed, without this bless
ing, the greatest of earthly enjoyments can avail us but little. Now
without a knowledge of some of the most important functions of the
human structure, how can we hope to treat ourselves or children in
a manner conducive to health ?# Let me ask, would we not require
a machinist who undertook the charge of a steam engine, to under
stand its mode of operation, of shutting off and putting on steam at
appropriate times, and conducting every other department of duty
* Dr. Andrew Combe on the Physiology of Digestion, ought to form a
part of every family library.
no
with correctness, fidelity and despatch—
a knowledge of which can
only be acquired by a long and studied acquaintance with the ope
rations of the machine and its various parts. What would be the
results of placing one in charge of the engine who had never
received the least instruction upon this subject ! Why, we should
apprehend the most disastrous consequences to ensue.
And yet, I should say, precisely in this condition are those parents
placed, when the charge of a family devolves on them without their
having the least previous acquaintance with the structure and or
ganization of the tender and delicate beings thus entrusted to their
charge. It is very true that the instinctive love and fondness we
have for children might prevent us committing any very glaring
mistakes ; but although nature has endowed the whole of created
beings with this necessary faculty in a corresponding ratio with the
care and attention necessary for their health and preservation, yet to
man has she denied those strong instinctive propensities possessed
in so remarkable a manner
by the inferior order of animals for the
care of their young, &c. Yet as man, of all other beings, comes
into the world more helpless, more tender ana delicate, requiring
also much more varied nutriment, and for a much greater length of
time, but as she has not been thus liberal to him, she has far more
than compensated in this respect by the endowment of that God-like
attribute which we call reason, and by the cultivation of which we
can render ourselves infinitely more competent to discharge our
duties. By judiciously exercising his reasoning faculties, man can
immeasurably surpass the brute creation, in this respect as in every
other, as instanced by his skill in the management of animals, &c.
But how does the case stand at present, with regard to his own
offspring ? Why, it has been clearly ascertained by statistical tables
that in Europe an immense portion, computed to be one-third of the
whole number born, perish in their infancy. And can we
arraign
the wisdom or goodness of Divine Providence in this fatality of the
human species in the earlier stages of existence? By comparing this
frightful mortality with that of the lower order of animals, we
have indeed reason to blush at the comparison ! No such mortality
exists amongst the inferior animals, or by any means
approaching
it, and we must come to the inevitable conclusion that in spite of
the boasted improvements of the age, we are yet lamentably defi
cient in this most important matter. Every person having the
happiness and well-being of others in view, ought to direct his most
earnest attention to this subject, in order to avert the fatal conse
quences here alluded to.
Mr. G. Combe [see Appendix,] also has acquired a
very great and
deserved celebrity from his beautiful exposition and philosophical
mode of investigating and applying the science as a moral rule of
action. He contends, and beautifully exemplifies, that by studying
Ill
and adopting the rules which regulate physical nature, as
divulged by
the studies of Phrenology and Physiology, we may attain the high
est degree of health and happiness ; and also that by studying the
laws of health, we
may infinitely improve ourselves both in our
physical and moral being, and also that these conditions are much
more
nearly allied than is generally supposed by superficial observers.
It will be found there is nothing more conducive to happiness
than health ; and yet it is astonishing how much this condition is
neglected, both in regard to the laws of hereditary descent, and also
those of pure air, exercise, and dietetics. How many of even the
better educated act as though there were no physical laws, which
govern existences, and of animated nature, of which we form a part.
How profoundly ignorant are many on these subjects ! And yet,
without health we are unfit to exercise our intellectual faculties, to
receive education, or to fulfil our duties in our social relations.
Without health, we
may become a burthen to ourselves and others ;
and yet we are
continually outraging some of the most obvious and
most salutary laws, which are unquestionably framed for our
good,
and by a moderate attention to and observance of which, we may
immeasurably promote our own and others' happiness.
Could man but implicitly submit himself to the will of his Creator,
or, in other words to his natural laws, and their peculiar application
to himself, as revealed by a thorough and accurate acquaintance
with his own innate feelings and fundamental, primitive character,
as developed by Phrenology, he would infinitely advance in religion,
virtue, and happiness. This naturally leads to the vast importance
of the
HEREDITARY TRANSMISSION OF ACQUIRED HABITS
AND IMPROVED ORGANIZATION.
In showing the remarkable phenomena exhibited by nature in the
transmission of hereditary qualities, we shall be greatly assisted in
our researches after truth by a comparison of animals, particularly
those which are under the guardianship and tutelage of man, as the
horse, dog, &cc. Of the infinite variety of these animals, we must
regard them as having each sprung from a common stock ; and the
great diversity of talents, temper and disposition of the dog are
clearly traceable to the care and attention bestowed on him by man,
not only in training and teaching them particular habits and acquire
ments, but also in the very great care and expense incurred by in
dividuals in selecting the most beautifully formed and more perfect
specimens to perpetuate their respective forms and qualities. So
great has been the success attending this plan in England, where it
has certainly been carried to a wonderful degree of perfection, that
it is found possible to produce dogs, horses> &c, of almost any
112
required qualities, simply by a judicious selection of the parent
stock.* To prove the possibility of this transmission of qualities, it
is well known that the more perfectly educated dogs, as the pointer,
setter, &c, not only themselves but also their offspring, inherit in a
remarkable degree those rare qualities for which they are so much
prized.
Now, in order fully to understand this subject, we must bear in
mind that the qualities here alluded to are by no means their natu
ral propensities, but are all acquired, and show how much nature
may be moulded and even entirely changed by art. The same
may
also be said of the human species.
*
Dog fanciers, &c, are frequently much better acquainted with the
pedigree and ancestry of their horses and dogs, than of their own families
and appear to think it of greater importance.

113
REMARKS ON THE MURDERER R .
The drawing of the large head above is of a most cool and delib
erate murderer, whose name we will suppress in consideration of
his numerous relatives. He had received a good education, and
for some time was captain of a steamer plying to New Orleans.
He subsequently engaged in the Texian service, and held the rank
of lieutenant at the period of his committing the murders of two
individuals, (a medical gentleman and a
passenger,) who had left
the Texian vessel in the Gulf of Mexico, near the mouth of Bayou
la Fourche. It appeared in evidence, on the trial, that R and
an accomplice left the vessel on the pretext of gunning, when in
reality they pursued the two gentlemen up the Bayou, each agreeing
to participate in the murder, but the courage of his accomplice failing,
this Lieut. R shot both the unfortunate gentlemen. They then
sank one body, by tying heavy shot to it, which they had brought
from the vessel for this purpose. It was their intention to sink both
the bodies, but they found the shot would not be sufficiently heavy,
so they dragged one on shore, and buried him in the swamp, where
he was afterwards found. The motive for the deed could not be
ascertained, as neither of the gentlemen alluded to had property of
value with them. These criminals had the audacity to take back
some of the murdered victims' articles on board the vessel, and as
they had been absent all day, and were seen to secrete some articles
under the spars on deck, it led to some suspicion, and, on examina
tion, proving to be articles of* the two gentlemen who left in the
morning, they were ironed whilst in their cots, taken to Thibadeau-
ville, and both found guilty. Johnson, the accomplice, was repriev-
114
ed ; this R was executed, and under those appalling circum
stances, as he had himself asserted, and as the extraordinary head
would indicate, he retained his composure and self-possession in a
most extraordinary degree. He appeared the least affected of any
present. His conduct strongly contrasted with the sobs and lamen
tations of the females, (who could see the execution from their
dwellings.) All else was as quiet as the grave. The narrator has
seen eight poor malefactors suspended at once in the midst of a
populous city, without experiencing sensations of horror as at
this time. The sun was
shining in his meridian splendor, with a
glorious brilliancy. Enormous trees, with their giant arms fes
tooned with long, sweeping, but sombre looking Spanish moss, filled
the background, conveying a melancholy but picturesque effect to
this scene of extremest human suffering and anguish, and, it may
be added, of almost super-human courage exhibited, worthy a more
glorious field.
At his own request, he had been furnished with an extra length
and thickness of rope ; the gibbet was of an extra height, that he
might have five feet to fall, in order, as he said, to make quick
work of it. He required no assistance in ascending the ladder, or
in placing the rope round his neck, nor was his face covered. He
thus stood firm as a statue for several minutes after every thing
was ready. Bowing gracefully to the few assembled, he gave the
preconcerted signal, the sheriff withdrew the bolt, and, with a tre
mendous crash and dislocation of the neck, in a few moments, with
out a struggle, a distorted, hideous, livid corse swung before us, a
terrible example to evil-doers.
His head, it will be seen in the measures, is strikingly like Deaf
Burke, the noted English pugilist, who has, we believe, killed several
in boxing. It is also a remarkable fact, that in his fight with the
Irish champion, O'Rourke, about that time, he nearly killed him in
two or three rounds, and had not the deaf one been furnished by an
American gentleman present, with one of those huge cleavers called
a bowie knife, with which he fought his way out of a mob, he would
have been destroyed on the spot by the infuriated Irishmen and
friends of O'Rourke, who was the boxing champion of New
Orleans.
It is also said of this murderer that he performed a similar exploit
in New Orleans at a former period.
When the author visited New Orleans jail, he found no difficulty
in selecting the worst criminal there. He was a most notorious,
pugnacious person, and his fellow prisoners dubbed him John Bull.
His head was very similar to this murderer, but he would not be
measured, although the author offered him a sum, as he imagined
and (like many other criminals,) was fearful some actions of his
past life would be revealed by such an examination.
115
NATIVE HINDOO SKULL, FROM CALCUTTA.
The small skull is that of a Hindoo, being one of six which were
procured from Hindoostan by Dr. J. V. C. Smith, of Boston. The
heads of each are
strikingly similar, as the tables of measures show,
being very small in Destructiveness, or 6, and very large in 12, or
Caution. A drawing of one suffices for the whole. They are all
strikingly illustrative of their national defect, timidity and coward
ice—
so much so, they have been the prey of every invader, from the
earliest records to the present time. Hindoostan has been conquered
and successively held in bondage by the ancient Greeks, the Per
sians, the Tartars, the Moguls, and more
recently by the British,
who, with a
comparatively small force, still hold this country in a
state of vassalage, and exercise a
despotic jurisdiction over the
natives, chiefly by fomenting petty jealousies amongst the native
princes, setting them at war with each other, and then, under the
pretence of arbitrating their differences, levying enormous annual
contributions from each, who, in their turn, levy these on their peo
ple, producing in some seasons great destitution and misery ; thus
perpetuating one vast system of plunder, unworthy a great and en
lightened peopie.*
When a youth, the author visited Calcutta, when the Burmese
had obtained some
advantage over the British, and it was thought
necessary by the British East India government to obtain an addi
tional volunteer marine corps from the British ships then in port at
*
The British tory government, under the old idiot George III., would
have succeeded in affording just such protection to the Americans, had the
heads of the Revolutionary patriots been like these. That monarch's
head, as exhibited on the bronze equestrian statue in London, the author
has phrenologically examined, and pronounces it but a
very little superior
to the Idiot, [see portrait No. 2,] although the work of the first sculptor
of the age. The whole head is the most repulsive he has ever seen. A
phrenologist almost shudders to look at such an inferior head.
This idiotic monarch has also generally been described by Byron,
and other independent writers, as
having a dog forehead. Of course, it is
a matter of history that he was confined as a lunatic for many years. The
portraits we have of him are grossly flattered, as well as those generally
of Queen Victoria, and others of royal blood, both male and female.
The descendants of this old fool are, and have been in their private lives,
with scarcely any exception, the most notoriously vicious characters in
Great Britain. They have expended millions on millions of the people's
money in every species of crime and debauchery, of which the world
scarcely affords a parallel, some of which are almost unknown here.
It was the author's first object, on arriving in this country, to forswear
allegiance to such superlative villanies, and he cannot here help recording
his opinions and his detestation of their tyranny and robberies on their
own people. It is hoped the English and American people will unite
against their only common enemy, the aristocracy of Great Britain.
116
Calcutta, the Sir Thomas Grenville's crew and officers, about one
hundred, volunteered. The government, in place of these, furnished
three hundred of the most robust Lascars to stow the ship's cargo,
&c, and at the end of two weeks they had scarcely accomplished as
much as one hundred Englishmen would do in half that period. In
lifting any article, however light, as many would cluster around it
as nearly to hide the object. In forging a small piece of iron, four
or five will station themselves around the anvil, striking at intervals.
He has also seen four using one large saw, and so on with their
other tools. They have smaller heads than probably any other
people whatever. They appear to have remained stationary for ages.
A PLAN
WHEREBY ALL PERSONS MAY BECOME THEIR OWN PHRENOLOGIST;
ALSO TO CHOOSE A WIFE, COMPANION, OR FRIEND.
117
Apply the end of a common
tape measure exactly to the meatus or
opening of either ear, and draw it round horizontal, (the head being
perpendicular,) to the opposite ear, and the number of inches gives
the strength or size of the particular organs it covers. The same
mode may be resorted to in the direction of the dotted lines, to as
certain the proportion of the other organs so specified.
The whole may be compared with the sizes here given of F.
Coombs's approved bust, (but which, owing to mistake, is rather too
large in Amativeness.)
This mode will afford a
very simple and very correct way of as
certaining the leading phrenological character.
Superior female heads are
usually rather smaller than the male
head which these admeasurements represent.
The measure of the base of circumference of head will contrast
with the portion immediately above it, (the dotted lines,) and serves
to show the controling organs, Intellect, Caution, &c, as opposed to
the propelling or animal powers, or base of brain. The measure
fiom bottom of forehead, or
Individuality, to the occipital spine, (or
small, bony projection near the base of skull behind,) serves to show
the intellectual and sentimental powers, and when larger here than
in the bust is a very favorable indication of character.
By this method, we
only obtain the general outline of character,
but it clearly shows that which is most important to know, viz., the
proportions which the various parts of the brain or implied leading
characteristics bear to each other. This admeasurement of the head
also embraces, besides those named on the cut, the organs which the
tape passes over, for which reason we may take it as a general
classification of the various organs, as
they are embraced in groups
by this measure, nearly all being of a similar character, through the
line which the tape covers, and the measurements in each region
give a very fair estimate of the general character, much more to be
depended on than the mode of guessing by some phrenologists, who
seldom resort to measuring the head, and who must consequently be
more liable to error of judgment.
This mode of estimating character has been too much overlooked,
and to promote this object, the tables of measures are furnished in
this book, which he means to adopt as his standard, also for the
purpose of eliciting truth by such measures. As an
instance, should
any gentleman remarkable for his philanthropy be found to mea
sure very low in the region of Benevolence, we will abandon Phre
nology, and proclaim it to be founded in error and misapprehension.
But we have not the slightest fear of such a result. The tables of
admeasurements show most conclusively the general characteristics
of the various individuals. He will still resort to the same method,
and intends to collect as manjr admeasurement* of remarkable per
sons as he possibly can, for which purpose he invites all public or
118
remarkable personages to have their heads measured, free of
expense, for future publication. The admeasurements of very re
markable, pious, amiable, or exemplary ladies are also much wanted
as a contrast to inferior heads.
The author extremely regrets that an admeasurement of his own
head, taken by the same instrument six years ago, was lost at the
printer's, as it would have conclusively shown a very considerable
increase of size in that period, without an increase of personal size
or weight, clearly showing that cerebral action, as in the exercise of
his profession, evidently tends to enlarge the brain.
He would here take this opportunity of qualifying an expression
made in a former part of this book, as to the sizes of the intellectual
organs of savages, &c, as one or two of the North Western Indian
Chiefs appear to be an exception to the rule of absolute size ; but
then it will be seen, relatively to the other parts or base of the brain,
they can scarcely be called large. Those chiefs were gigantic men,
most of them weighing over two hundred pounds, and the most ath
letic men he has seen on the continent of America. The author
had an opportunity of hearing Keokuck, the head chief, make a set
speech, of nearly one hour long, before a grand council of Indians.
His eloquence was the most impassioned and energetic he ever
heard, and the action chaste and perfectly appropriate. The lan
guage of the Indian is exceedingly guttural, and in perfect unison
with the strong, warlike passions which they so delight in expressing
in their war-whoop, words, and actions. Their language is peculiarly
harsh and discordant, and appears almost incapable of expressing
the softer emotions. Keokuck's speech will ever remain fixed in
memory, as an example of the stern, the fierce, the terrible. He
has never seen it surpassed by E. Forrest himself. It was
equally
picturesque, and standing as he did the ardent champion of a rem
nant of his race, invested him with a romantic interest which will
not be readily forgotten.
The author has visited amongst the North Western Indians, and
also, a few years since, the Hindoos of Asia, and in boyish sport
has chased many of the latter ; but a whole regiment of soldiers
will scarcely suffice to make the former run. They live entirely on
animal food, if they can
procure it. He has seen them eat flesh of
any description, scarcely half sodden, which they prefer, without
bread or vegetable of any kind. The females are not allowed to
partake till the men have eaten. They may be said to be perfectly
carniverous. (See their measures.) Also the East Indians, who, on
the contrary, are remarkably abstemious in their diet, will scarcely
destroy animals for food, but subsist chiefly on rice, vegetables, dec.
Indeed, so tender are they of animal life, they have hospitals pro
vided for many of them, and persons injuring them are
compelled by
law to support them and pay the doctor's fees.

APPENDIX,
ILLUSTRATIVE OF PHYSIOGNOMY.
[Referred to at page 108.]
Bleumanbach divides the human family into five different varieties, but
which perhaps may be more
properly called races. In their physiognomi
cal and. other pecubarities he thus classifies and describes :
1. The Caucassian race, inhabiting the greater portion of Europe, in
cluding the United States of America and some portion of Asia, are dis
tinguished by a
beautifully soft, fair, and transparent skin, susceptible of
every variety of tint ; the hair fine, long and curling, of various colors.
The skull is large and oval, and its anterior or intellectual region full and
elevated. The face is proportionably small, of an oval form, and deli
cately formed features. The chin full and rounded, and the teeth nearly
perpendicular. Portions of this race early attained the highest degree of
civilization and intellectual attainments.
2. The Mongolian race, inhabiting central and eastern Asia and some
portion of the North American continent, are characterized by a sallow or
olive skin, straight hair and thin beard ; the nose broad and short ; the
eyes small, black, and oblique ; the lips curled ; the cheek-bones broad
and flat. The skull is oblong-oval, flattened at the sides, with a
very low
forehead. In their intellectual character they exhibit considerable talents
and are somewhat susceptible of education and improvement.
3. The Malay race are inhabitants of the Polynesian group of isl
ands ; also Madagascar, Borneo, &c.
This race are characterized by a dark complexion, varying from a
tawny
hue to a very dark brown. Their hair is black, coarse, and lank, and
their eyelids drawn obliquely upwards at the outer angle. The mouth
and lips are large ; the nose is short and broad, and apparently broken at
its roots. The face is flat and expanded, the upper jaw projecting, the
teeth salient. The skull is high and rounded, and the forehead low and
broad. This race exhibit great difference and varieties amongst them.
Some are active and ingenious, but very degraded on the whole, and are
nearly the lowest in the scale of humanity.
120
The head of the Malay is large, and the nose short, depressed, and flat
at the nostrils. The eyes are small, black, oblique, and expressive. The
face is broad and very prominent, and the mouth and lips are
large.
Their color is a brown, with a bronze tint.
The skull of the Malay is very low in the forehead ; the cheek-bones
are
high and expanded; the jaws are greatly projected, and the upper
jaw, with the teeth, is much inclined outwards, and nearly horizontal.
The teeth remarkably fine and strong.
A portion of this family, living on the Island of Battas, are the most
remorseless and habitual cannibals on the face of the earth. Nay more,
they not only eat their victims, but eat them alive, or do not previously
put them to death, and these are not unfrequently their own people and
relations. Prisoners of war are eaten at once, and the slain devoured
without cooking.
In the great Island of Borneo, the Malays have possession of the entire
coast, and the mountainous region of the interior is peopled by the savage
Dayacks and Eidahous, who are represented as being fairer than the
Malays, but still more
sanguinary and ferocious.
The Polynesian family, a portion of whom, the New Zealanders, are
the most
sanguinary and intractable. Their combined treachery, cruelty,
and cannibalism have made them proverbial since the discovery of their
island. Capt. Crozet, whose crew they attempted to destroy, thus de
scribes them : —
"
They treated us (says he) with every show of friendship
for thirtV-three days, with the intention of eating us on the thirty-fourth."
The lu'gee Islanders vie with the New Zealanders in treachery and
cannibalism. Capt. Dillon gives a heart-rending account of the murder
of fourteen of his men, who were
subsequently baked in ovens, and after
wards devoured in his presence.
4. The American race is marked by a brown complexion, long, black,
lank hair, and deficient beard. The eyes are black and deep-set, the
brow low, the cheek-bones high, the nose large and aquiline, the mouth
large, and the lips tumid and compressed. The skull is small, wide be
tween the parietal bones, prominent at the vertex. Their characteristics
are slowness and distaste for acquiring knowledge, stern, unyielding,
proud, revengeful and cruel. [See table of admeasurements of distin-
fuished chiefs, who are mostly gigantic men, and have unusually fine
eads for savages, far the best in the collection.]
*
5. The Ethiopian variety, inhabiting the greater portion of Africa and
the continent (it may be called) of New Holland, and islands adjacent,
are characterized by black complexion, black, woolly hair, eyes large and
prominent, the nose broad and flat, the lips thick, and the mouth wide.
The head is long and narrow, and the forehead low ; the cheek-bones
prominent, the jaws projecting, and the chin small. The several nations
comprised in this variety are rather diversified, but extremely low, and
amongst the most degraded of the human species ; amongst whom are
the Hottentots, whose complexion is of a
yellow brown, or bright olive ;
the hair black and woolly, and very small beard ; the backhead large ;
receding forehead, and wide, large face ; the eyes far apart, the nose broad
and flat ; and the women if possible more repulsive than the men.
They are inveterately indolent and gluttonous, devouring every kind of
121
animal refuse that falls in their way, without preparation, and then throw
themselves down and sleep off the effects. Their dwellings are mud-
hovels, bushes, caves, or clefts in the rocks. Many go naked, without
shame ; others partially cover themselves with the skins of animals they
kill. They have no more notion of decency or cleanliness than animals,
are robbers by profession, and kill everything indiscriminately which they
cannot
carry with them.
The Bosjesmans are far more degraded and savage than any other
Hottentot tribes. Some maintain that
they are different from the Hot
tentots, and constitute the ultimate link in the scale of humanity.
The face of the New Hollander is ugly in the extreme ; projects greatly
from the head, and the mouth is particularly prominent, with very thick
and protuberant lips. The nose is flat and broad and the nostrils ex
panded. A deep sinus separates the nose from the forehead, and the
frontal ridges overhang the eyes, while the forehead is low and slopes
rapidly to the top of the head. The hair is often long, very coarse, and
frizzled, yet rarely woolly. They are perpetually engaged in war, and
seldom if ever pardon an enemy, but generally kill and eat them. Their
courtship, if such it can be called, consists in violence, and their women
are treated through life with unparalleled brutality. They are to the last
degree filthy and gluttonous in the extreme.
A portion of the Australian family, inhabiting the Island Andaman, are
of small stature, slender limbs, protuberant abdomen, high shoulders,
and large faces, exhibiting a horrid mixture of famine and ferocity.
Foster compares the people of Malicolo to monkeys, and asserts that
he had seen no negroes in whom the forehead was so depressed.
This family is also- found in the numerous islands near Guinea, New
Britain, Admiralty, and Hermit Island, &c.
The origin of color, and other differences amongst the human family,
have frequently employed the pens of historians and philosophers. Here
is one opinion attempting to elucidate this subject, by Dr. Caldwell :
"
It is computed, by the Mosaic account, that about four thousand one
hundred and ninety years from the creation, Noah and his family left the
ark, who, from the most undoubted authority, were of the Caucassian or
white race ; and yet we have the most abundant historical evidences, that
above three thousand years ago the Ethiopian or negro family were
known as inhabiting a portion of Africa, and possessing their present
characteristics. Consequently, if of the same race as the white, the
change of color, features, &c, must have been effected in less than one
thousand years, and then remained stationary to the present day."
To illustrate the fact that color is not the effect of a warm climate or
exposure to the sun, nor the peculiar characteristic of ihe negroes alone,
some of the Esquimaux (eaters of raw flesh,) on the icy shores of the
island of Greenland, are extremely dark and many of them at Oppem-
wick are quite as dark as the mullatoes. Crantz, the missionary, says
that they are crafty, sensual, ungrateful, obstinate, and unfeeling. They
also devour the most disgusting animals, uncleaned and uncooked. Their
mental faculties present a continued childhood. They are fickle and fa
cetious, and their connubial infidelity is a proverb among voyagers. In
gluttony, selfishness, and ingratitude, they are perhaps unequalled by any
other people in the world.
122
[Referred to at page 110.]
The Diary of Mr. Combe, in his late tour in the United States, is some
what more impartial than
any of the preceding English tourists, yet does
not, we humbly conceive, fully appreciate the great differences in the mo
narchical and republican forms of government on the character of man.
There appears, though to a less extent, the same carping at unimportant
trifles, and a want of comprehensiveness of the magnificent whole, as pre
sented by the entire American people, more
particularly as evidenced by
the gigantic strides, within a
very few years, in every useful art and
science, and probably in none so much as those immense public works of
utility, the railroads and canals, which are intersecting every part of the
Union, and uniting all the people in one
community of purpose and feel
ing. In a military point of view, also, these are of incalculable impor
tance, as by this means of communication an army of one hundred thou
sand men can be concentrated in any one point on the Atlantic north of
the Potomac in twenty-four hours, rendering us invulnerable to any power
which can be brought against the republic by sea or land. The Ameri
cans may proudly contrast with the same race of people under a monarch
ical form of government, but let it be a loving, a generous comparison.
We must also beg leave entirely to dissent from Mr. C, in his views
as to the justice and expediency of the movements of the chartists in
England, who are contending for vote by ballot and universal suffrage,
and whom we conceive to be engaged in the most righteous cause that
men were ever yet employed in. We insist upon.it, nothing but lunacy,
idiocy, or crimes can
justify withholding from, or
depriving any man or
body of men, the privilege of managing their own affairs. Shall we be
told by Mr. C, or any other gentleman, that because some disorders may
possibly ensue, (and this is merely his gratuitous supposition,) that we
are still to continue the same villanous state of things which has reduced
the true nobility of England and Ireland, (the working peojjle,) to the
condition of the poorest slaves in existence, (excepting in the actual sale
of their bodies?) And still, according to him, we are to persevere in this
same course, which has so brutalized the people that he attempts to show
they are unfit to exercise the privileges of men.
Away with such
unjusti
fiable legislation.' Such arguments, no doubt, have their weight with the
contemptible aristocracy of Great Britain, who really seem to imagine
that all other people were born like beasts to bear their burthens. By a
strange perversity of reasoning, totally unexpected from Mr. C, their
tyranny and oppression are to be continued until these same causes which
have produced this state of things have resulted in a state of things pre
cisely dissimilar and diametrically opposite !
If we
comprehend Mr. C, he deliberately advances this as his opinion,
which we most solemnly protest against. Notwithstanding our admira
tion for him on other subjects, on this we are enlisted body and soul, and
will not give up our opinion to any man living.
By the same
parity of reasoning, the kind and generous slave-holder
thinks he is doing good service in retaining his slave in his obedience
until he has qualified him for what he conceives to be necessary for
his happiness and comfort, and is competent to enjoy and make a rational
use of his liberty. Abolitionists will tell you how far distant such a day will
123
be with those whose optics are so blinded by prejudice, they can only see
the ignorance and debasement of the slave, and not the causes which have
led to it, or the unalienable rights of man to be free. Both these systems
of slavery in England and America equally tend to brutalize man. And
those who hold them in bondage have the same kind charity for them—
to
take care of them until they are fit, in their estimation, to receive their
freedom.
Such are the robberies and exactions on the poor working citizens of
Great Britain, that this class have rarely the means to purchase books of
popular authors, from the price being usually three or fourfold the price
the same books are sold for in this country. Hence the press and nearly
the whole of English literature is and must be purely aristocratic.
Mr. C. also complains of us in this respect, as doing a great injustice
to authors ; but Mr. C. might equally well complain of the whole world
besides, for all freely avail themselves of English, French, and German
literature, without this complaint being brought against them, and we see
no
injustice in our availing ourselves of the same privilege on a
larger,
which others do on a smaller scale ; for we see no reasons to make dis
tinctions of persons. If English authors appeal to the generosity of the
American people for some remuneration for their works, we think it
would be conceded ; but we cannot conceive why they should levy contri
butions, on this score, upon us more than any other people whatever,
from whom we never heard of their making any such demands as from
us.
That the Americans and the whole civilized world are deeply, immeasu
rably indebted to English literature, must be conceded ; whilst it may also
be complained of that the spirit of English literature is decidedly aristo
cratic and extremely injurious, as it so largely contributes to the formation
of character ; and most of the vices of aristocracy in this country are the
injurious effects of English literature on public taste, which is and must
be decidedly aristocratic until a new order of things appear in England,
which we hope is not far distant, wJien the sovereign people will sweep
their barbarous oppressors like chaff before the wind, by the force of pub
lic opinion, when once they are thoroughly aroused to their own rights by
the agitations, &c, of the chartists. America, we
hope, is destined
largely to contribute to this change. Then will the English and Ameri
cans be united as one people in a noble and generous rivalry of love ; but
this can never be until the wholepeople of England have assumed or
pos
sess a share in conducting the affairs of the government, and have driven
their present tyrants and enemies of all mankind from the power which
they have so unjustly usurped, and made themselves odious in the sight of
all mankind, from India to the poles.
Mr. C. relates an amusing incident occurring on board the steamboat,
as he was
proceeding to Albany. It appears a
passenger had unwittingly-
supposed that, as Mr. Combe was a
phrenologist, he also examined heads.
But Mr. C. informs us he does not in public, or for pay ; which we think
is to be regretted.
On the same page, (54, vol. 2,) Mr. C. does an injustice to a most
worthy, sensitive young gentleman of Kentucky, (Mr. Porter,) whom
Mr. C. says we made a show of, to add to the attractions of Phrenology.
Now, the fact is, Mr. P., (the Kentucky Giaut, as he is usually called,
124
being the tallest man in the world,) had actually refused ten thousand
dollars a year, if he would consent to be exhibited, but he declined. [See
his Self-Esteem.] Major Stevens, also alluded to, was engaged as secre
tary. Mr. C. examined their very singular and most extraordinary heads
in public, and lectured before twenty thousand persons in New York, in
five weeks, of course owing to this aitraction. [N. B. Wanted just such
another couple of extraordinary heads to lecture from. See their admea
surements.]
Mr. C. is not the only person to whom ludicrous mistakes have oc
curred from similarity of names. Whilst the author was at Saratoga, an
unfortunate tailor of Albany sent a bill and pair of pants, (not G. M.,)
to Congress Hall, addressed "
Mr. Combs, Phrenologist," whilst he
was at that house. This was rather ludicrous, as they were a complete
misfit, and the author never ordered or purchased a pair in the city of
Albany in his itinerising lours.
As to the similarity of names, F. Coombs will be here excused for men
tioning that his family are, and have been for fifty years past, extensively
engaged as architects and builders, 9 and 10 Benett's Hill, St. Paul's,
London. One of his relatives also is the architect of the most costly
public edifices now erecting in the United States.
F. Coombs having had twenty years' experience in Europe, eight years
in the United States and Canada, and several months' residence in the
East Indies, hopes at a future day to give his impressions of the Anglo-
Saxon family, as elicited under the governments republican, monarchical,
and colonial. He had, previous to his last visit to England, foresworn
allegiance to the British crown. America is now his home, and although
born within the very shadow of St. Paul's, London, he shall call himself
a Yankee phrenologist. He detests monarchical abuses and robberies,
and none so much as the British tories, whom he conceives the greatest
and most impudent robbers on this earth, not only of their own victimised,
impoverished people, but of all creation, wherever they have the power;
as witness their robberies in India, Ohina, &c. But thank God, this they
could not do for '
Jonathan' when in his infancy of growth, and he has
nothing to fear now from all the tories in the world.
We are
tempted to preach a crusade against these human harpies, or
thieving tories, who are the curse of this earth. They have impoverished
and nearly ruined dear old England, and reduced her noble sons and
daughters to the condition of the veriest slaves on earth. Great God !
shall such things always be ?
Some of these hireling tourists are their strongest allies and supporters,
by misrepresenting everything here, generous, free, or American. We
certainly feel induced to publish also our tour, or
peregrinations, to
show how much the Americans and their free institutions have been be
lied. The author has experienced the kindness of the Americans, from
the President in his palace to the squatter in his log cabin on the banks
of the Mississippi, and strongly and utterly condemns the impressions of
most preceding tourists, as being infinitely different and totally at variance
from the truths he has arrived at, after a residence of above seven
years in
this country.
125
CONCLUDING REMARKS.
The author would have thought it unbecoming to introduce matter so
irrelevant to this subject as any allusion to his own family, were it not
rendered necessary in self-justification, as one of the most distinguished,
benevolent, and truly philanthropic clergyman of Boston intimated or
suggested to a friend of the writer, that as
'
F. Coombs '
was so similar
to
'
G. Combe,' it might be an assumed name, for interested purposes.
Having thus, in self-defence, introduced his family, he will be excused for
mentioning, that, as a further illustration of Phrenology and Physiology,
or the hereditary transmission of family peculiarities, talents, &c, he has
before alluded to the artistical mechanical talents of his relatives. He
would also state that he has in his possession, and will be happy to show
the ladies and others, a very extraordinary specimen of the fine arts, exe
cuted by a self-taught boy, his cousin, J. E. Coombs, of Mornington
Crescent, London. It is a most beautiful engraving of the entire creed,
the Lord's prayer, the ten commandments, Gloria Patria, 117th Psalm,
forty verses of scripture, and forty-one parts of verses, with name, date,
&c, all correctly punctuated, with appropriate capitals, &c, the whole
being comprised within a circle of less than half an inch in diameter, or
the size of an ancient Peter's penny. He is also the self-taught mezzo-
tinto engraver of '
Reading the Scriptures,' and other religious subjects.
Another cousin, also a boy, by some specimens of his ingenuity so
pleased Mr. Brunei, the celebrated projector of the Thames tunnel, that
at his earnest
request, he was placed under his tuition in the prosecution
of that great national work.
The writer himself, also, a few years since, constructed, (principally with
his own hands,) an electro -magnetic locomotive engine, of a greater power
possibly than any other ever made, being sufficient to carry passengers on
railroad, for which a
diploma was awarded by the American Institute,
New York, which he has in his possession. This machine was also ex
hibited at Niblo's, the New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washing
ton museums, and subsequently purchased by Dr. Chilton, of New York.
He had also received the sum of 70/. sterling, voted to him by the coun
cil of the Royal Gallery of Practical Science, London, for the use of his
model machines in that institution. A Russian prince, also, in London,
made him a very liberal proposition to proceed to Russia to superintend
the construction of some large machines, on his plan, for the emperor ;
but a residence of five years in this country had made him too much of a
Yankee, and he wished above all things to return to his beloved America,
and, if possible, to induce the Americans to assist the oppressed English
and Irish people to regain their liberty. He has many very dear relations
in England, but with whom he is diametrically opposed in politics.
They denounce him as a perfect Yankee ; and, of course, he retorts, by
calling them the unfortunate subjects of her little majesty, who are regu
larly swindled above fifty millions of pounds sterling annually, to be
squandered by those precious scamps, the nobility, royal family, and gen
teel cutthroats in the army, navy, &c, with a host of other noble pauper
pensioners, comprising in the whole the most formidable and expensive
126
banditti that any country was ever infested with, for they produce a con
tinuous famine amongst the really deserving.
The author never could be happy in Europe, in any circumstances.
There is such a vast disparity in the condition of the people, and so much
frightful destitution amongst the poorer classes, that he was
truly misera
ble in witnessing, without having the power to relieve them. He never
wishes to revisit Old England, unless he has the means of doing the poor
some good, by the diffusion of honest republican principles ; and to this
end he would beg the assistance of every generous American, as he firmly
and conscientiously believes, the best way to secure their own
happiness
and freedom, and to establish it on an
imperishable basis, will be to ex
tend their generous assistance and sympathy to the poor and unfortunate
of England and Ireland, as they are worthy their warmest
sympathy and
regard ; for never, in our opinion, were any class of people so
patiently, so
incessantly, engaged in toil, both night and day, and from the tenderest
iufancy to extremest old age, as the mechanics and laborers of England,
Ireland, and Scotland are, and all for the aggrandisement of their worse
than Egyptian task-masters, who, by the machinations of unjust laws and
enormous taxations, have appropriated to themselves the greater part of
the earnings of the industrious classes.
Never did a people toil so incessantly, never did a
people exhibit more
faithfulness in their respective duties, and never, do we think, were any
people so outrageously defrauded of their just earnings, or subject to so
many privations, as the unfortunate productive classes of Europe, but
more
particularly of Great Britain and Ireland. The sympathies of the
generous have here often been appealed to in behalf of the enslaved
Greeks, the oppressed Polanders, and even of the remote South Sea
Islanders, and Africans at home ; yet, we venture to say, desirable as it
may be to afford them assistance, their absolute wants we believe were
never so urgent as the oppressed artisans of Great Britain ; nor do we
believe generosity could be so well applied, to produce such good results
both to the giver and receiver. The price of labor, materials, &c, iii
England, is of much greater importance to this country than is
generally
supposed. The rise or fall of cotton one farthing per pound, in Liverpool,
causes a corresponding change in value in the commodity in this country.
So it is with labor. We can in no way so
effectually improve and elevate
the condition of the laboring or producing classes in this country, as
by
elevating the same class in Europe ; for, so long as men there, by unjust
legislation, are compelled to labor for a shilling a
day, so long will our
markets here be glutted by the over-production from non-consumption by
these poor people in Europe, who present the horrible anomaly of being
the greatest producers of clothing, and other comforts and luxuries for
man, yet are themselves the worst fed and clothed of any human beings,
next to savages ; and unless this country is protected with heavy tariffs,
(which are fraught with evil,) we must always be glutted with foreign
manufactures made at these ruinously low prices.
Prohibitory tariffs are injurious to free trade, and are
diametrically op
posed to our free institutions, and also to our agricultural interests,
those composing which of course are desirous of purchasing their clothing,
&c., at the lowest possible price ; and the inevitable consequence appears
to us to be, that we must either elevate the condition of artisans in
Europe, or they will, and absolutely do at this day, very much depreciate
127
the condition of the productive classes here. So that policy, no less than
humanity, dictates the course we
ought to pursue to our suffering and op
pressed brethren in Europe ; and we contend, those having the first claim,
as being the greatest sufferers, are our brethren in England, and more
particularly Ireland, whom perhaps we ought to place first, as being the
most oppressed ; but she has more
powerful advocates than we, and may
she have many more of them !
Our space here does not permit our going into detail on this subject ;
but the English newspapers, decidedly aristocratic as they necessarily
must be, (the duty being 2id. each to the abominable government
—
conse
quently there are no
penny papers for the poor
—
and this, of course, is a
trick of the enemy to keep them in darkness as to their real condition,)
in their bickerings with each other, occasionally let out the truth as to the
real condition of the laboring classes, who can be scarcely said to have
any organ or papers to express their views, as the price of them from the
cause just stated, necessarily precludes the great body of the people,
who are miserably poor, from enjoying this literary luxury. The follow
ing table is gathered from one of them, which was
merely used as a
polit
ical argument, without expressing the least sympathy for the sufferings
here described, and which can scarcely be read without horror and indig
nation. It says :
"
In Liverpool there are 7,802 cellars, dark, damp, dirty, and ill-venti
lated, in which live 39,000 of the working people. There are also 2,270
courts, in which from two to six families reside, and few of these courts
have more than one outlet.
"
In Manchester, of 123,232 working people, 14,960 live in cellars.
"
In Bury the working classes are so
poorly off, that in 772 houses one
bed served for four persons ; in 907 one bed served for five persons, and
in 78 one bed for six persons.
"
In Bristol forty-six per cent, of the working classes have but one
room for a family.
"
Leeds is a
very poor, unhealthy place. Of 17,800 houses, 13,600 are
under 10/. rent.
"
In Glasgow the amount of wretchedness and disease is alarmingly
great. In 1827, 28,100 persons had fevers in that city, which has a
popu
lation of something like 250,000.
"With regard to paupers in London, it is observed that the whole
number of such persons in that city and suburbs, who received in and
out-door parochial relief, for the year ending March, 1838, was 77,186.
Of these, 13,972 were sick with fever, 7,017 from syanchus, and 5,692
from typhus."
Such paragraphs as the following are frequently met with :
"
Joseph Goldsmith, a nephew of the renowned Oliver Goldsmith, is
now living in extreme penury, in Great Peter street, Westminster. This
poor man is now in his seventy-third year. His only resource for a long
time past has been the teaching a few poor children, at 3d. per week, and
he is at this time on a sick bed, destitute of even the necessaries of
life-" , ,
But, thank God, these poor and oppressed people have many a nobfe-
souled champion, amongst whom stands foremost the brave, the gallant,
the chivalrous Irishman, Fergus O'Connor, the chartist, whom we have
heard braving the Lion in his den, and denouncing these tyrants to tlw
128
assembled multitude in Whitehall, in terms equally bold as those which
we have attempted there to use, and in this book also. This generous
Irishman, we conceive, is a greater friend to the poor than O'Cqnnell, as
he regards the English, as every generous man must do, as the joint suf
ferers with the Irish, and does not denounce them as their natural ene
mies, which, we conceive, is productive of incalculable mischief, and
retards the progress of liberal, extended, national philanthropy. It is this
very disunion of the Irish themselves, and sectional, party strife, which
has given their tory oppressors, both English and Irish, the means to
enslave them, as well as the English also. We conceive it ought to be
the aim of true
philanthropy to heal these unfortunate national antipa
thies, which have enabled these vile tories to embattle nations against
each other, and to murder by wholesale ; as witness England and France,
who for ages have been taught to regard each other as natural enemies.
So of the tory press of England, and the English tourists visiting this
country, before alluded to. These have done all they possibly could to
traduce and misrepresent everything in this country free or generous, in
order to create dislike in the people of England against us. These tories
would war on America to-morrow, had they but the same ignorant people
to
support them in it as in former times. But the light of truth and lib
erty is gradually diffusing itself, and the people of England begin to per
ceive, that by warring on America, they war with their very best friends.
This, it is hoped, will be more apparent every succeeding year; and we
venture to say, the tory government of England will yet continue to blus
ter, and bully this country as long as
they possibly can ; for they sincerely
hate liberty and republicanism. But, thank God, they dare not war on
this country now, as they know full well the chartist party at home, of
whom we are an humble advocate, would raise a more formidable
enemy
in their own suffering people, than they would find to contend with
here.
Let the free and generous Americans convince the poor of England that
they are their friends, by their sympathy and kindness to them, and
par
ticularly to this gallant O'Conner and his party, who have told the aristo
crats of England so many unpalatable truths, and have so
exposed their
villanies, that he is now immured in a loathsome prison. Yes, this noble
child of freedom, and friend of the suffering poor, with many others of the
same noble spirit, in England, have been punished by imprisonment and
transportation, for advocating the permission of every man who pays
taxes, to have a voice in the disbursement of those taxes. But no ; the
tyrant oppressors say,
'
You have no
knowledge of these matters ; they
are above your comprehension. We only require you to
pay ; we will
assume the duty of disbursing according to our will and pleasure ; and,
hark 'e, if you give us any of your advice, we will send you beyond the
seas, where you shall never see your dear wives or sweethearts more ! '
And these cold-blooded tyrants have done so.
The greatest men in this country, or indeed in any country, were the
patriots of the Revolution. These men have cast an imperishable halo
of glory around their names, in resisting the same tyrannous, would-be
masters, and teaching them (to use a fashionable phraseology) that '
they
could 'nt come it.' The generous advocates of the same
principles in
England, are now suffering every horror of banishment and imprisonment ;
and will not the free and the generous sympathize, ay, and assist them
129
too, some of whom, it is feared, are in indigence and poverty? These
men have been contending no less for the freedom of the present Ameri
cans, than did the patriots of the Revolution resist their usurping tyrants
for the good not only immediately of the Americans themselves, but as
the richest legacy they could bequeath to all mankind. Liberty achieved
is not the exclusive
property of any ; its
very spirit and essence is light
and life, and the more it is diffused abroad, the more is it invigorated and
strengthened at home.
These men, it ought to be remembered, have been moved by the dis
tresses of their countrymen ; and by the light of your liberty shining across
the Atlantic, have discovered the cause of their ruin and degradation, and
in the attempt to explain these causes to the suffering people, have been
most cruelly maltreated. But we invoke you, free Americans, by the
spirit of your gallant sires of '76, which we know is a talisman of power
you can
scarcely disobey, to sympathize with them. Nay, we who never
begged before, implore your assistance for these grievously wronged and
oppressed of our nearest kindred in Europe, and to extend your generosity
to these sincere and zealous friends to the poor, who have been engaged
in endeavoring to extend to them the same inestimable privileges so fully
enjoyed here. Let it be remembered, their wrongs and outrages are per
petrated by the same party, who still have the same malignant hatred
against liberty, and consequently against the Americans, as they always
have had, ana always will have ; and it is only by the diffusion of the
light of liberty and truth, that their robberies and villanies can
'
be made
known. Disseminating a knowledge of this country and its institutions
amongst the people of England, will prove the strongest safeguard . to
the continued liberty and happiness of the American people ; for so
long
as the people of England are ignorant or
degraded, so
long will they be
dangerous neighbors to liberty and America ; because these are the only
tools with which the tory aristocrats of Great Britain can carry on the
war.
Enlighten the people of England and Ireland, and they will perceive
you are their real friends. Sympathize with them, and endeavor to ele
vate their moral and physical condition, if you desire to improve your
own. Thus shall you secure to yourselves unalloyed and true happiness,
resulting from gratifying the moral sentiments only, and in doing good.
You will thereby secure the gratitude of mankind, and the downfall of
your only enemies, and those of all men, the proud aristocrats of Great
Britain, who only want the power to crush you and liberty now, as they
have attempted before, as in its establishment they hear their own death-
knell. .
Since writing thus far, we have heard the gratifying, the cheering intel
ligence of the receipt by Mr. O'Connell of a very liberal donation from the
generous and patriotic sons of Ireland here, who, aroused to a sense of
the wrongs of their patriotic coimtrymen, have determined to aid in their
rescue from the servile bondage in which they have been so long enslaved
by the tory aristocrats of Great Britain—
English, Irish, and Scotch—
as
witness Wellington, Castlereagh, and others, the most oppressive aristo
crats we ever knew, who have been the aiders and abettors of every villa-
nous scheme to impoverish England and Ireland indiscriminately.
Much as we admire and advocate Mr. O'Connell's views, it is with pain
and regret we again read a portion of his remarks, calculated to produce
130
differences betwixt the English and Irish people, who must be united in
sympathy and feeling before
they can both be free and happy ; for so long
as
they are divided, so long will their oppressors rule them both. Sym
pathizing sincerely as we
hope we do with any movement which can im
prove the condition of the poor, we must express our surprise that Mr.
O'Connell, whilst advocating a
partial measure of freedom for the Irish
people, should denounce, as he has done, Mr. Fergus O'Conner and the
chartist party in England, as rebels, and boast that he would, in case it
were required by the government, bring an
army of one hundred thousand
of his repealers to put down chartism. Surely, the free and universal
suffrage of all men, and women too, and the vote by ballot, with annual
parliament, can be the only and efficient remedy whereby the monstrous
evils at present afflicting the whole people can by possibility be reformed.
Can it be imagined the corrupt court, which wields one half the legis
lative power in England, for good or ill, and the other half by their
hereditary legislators, the proud house of peers, in their own persons and
by their nominees in the house of commons, can ever be made to disgorge
their ill-gotten power and plunder, unless it is by a union of the whole
people, English, Irish, and Scotch—and we hope we may yet say, the
Americans, for we insist they would be almost as much benefitted by a
course of just and liberal policy in England, as the whole English people
themselves.
The mind is almost lost in the contemplation of the stupendous effects
which would result, with our new facilities of communication, in trade,
commerce, civilization, and advancement in knowledge and happiness,
could the formidable barriers once be removed, which now
cruelly divide
those who are so nearly—
may we say, so dearly—
allied by every tie of
kindred, sympathy, literature, and science ! In Great Britain and Europe
how many noble spirits, of a truly Shaksperean or Newtonian mould,
would shine in the
literary world, were
they not subdued, repressed and
lost to the world, by the inhuman tyranny which subdues their energies !
A million pens would not suffice to describe the details of misery, which
like gaunt, famine-struck spectres of every grade, start up before you at
every turn in that vast metropolis and emporium, London, where also sit
boundless riot, ruin, debauchery, and extravagance, presenting pictures to
make humanity shudder. Here is where the most abandoned profligate
nobles and the most notorious courtezans have sat cheek by cheek with
royalty, or the boasted fountain of- honor ! If this be so
impure, what
are the streams to flow from it 1 Their history will answer.
We are desirous of advocating a
peaceful remedy for these enormous
abuses ; and in no
way do we conceive this can be effected but by diffu
sing cheap political intelligence respecting this country, by lectures and
pamphlets, amongst the poor of Great Britain.
As for the author, he has taken his stand. Although he may be sus
pected, traduced, and probably disowned, yet will he humbly advocate the
opinions here expressed. And what is here advanced as
truth, may you,
gentle reader, receive as such, and reject the errors and imperfections.
In conclusion, permit him to repeat
—
the union of the producing classes in
England and America is the only means effectually to improve their own
condition and that of all mankind.
