  Near  Death Experience Overview    
  by Dr. Jeff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


  &nbsp;&nbsp; The  Near-Death Experience (NDE) may be defined as   &quot;A lucid experience  associated with perceived consciousness apart from the body occurring at the  time of actual or threatened imminent death.&quot;&nbsp;  This definition is  further discussed in the section &quot;NDERF RESEARCH&quot;.
  
  ***  If you have experienced a NDE, please  consider sharing the experience with us.&nbsp; We hope our findings will help  NDE experiencers further understand the meaning of their experience.***
  
  NDE's are relatively common.&nbsp; A Gallup  Poll in 1992 led to an estimate that 13 million Americans may have experienced  an NDE.&nbsp; Research indicates approximately 30% of all people facing a life  threatening event will experience an NDE.
  
  Previous NDE investigators have greatly contributed our understanding of NDE.&nbsp;  What is clear is that NDE is not a hallucination or mental/psychiatric  dysfunction. &nbsp; They are real.&nbsp; All NDE experiencers we talked with  felt their experience was significant and meaningful.&nbsp; NDE experiencers may  have questions regarding their experience, yet have a deep sense the experience  was real.
  
  We are impressed with both the similarities and dissimilarities of NDE  experiences. &nbsp; While some experiencers have a detailed and prolonged  experience, others have a shorter and less &quot;dramatic&quot; experience.&nbsp;  We believe all NDE experiences are significant and important in our quest  to learn their meaning.

  No two NDE experiences are identical, but within a group of experiences certain  patterns become evident.&nbsp; NDE experiencers describe one or more of the  following (the order may vary):
  
  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Difficulty in explaining the NDE.&nbsp;  Ordinary language often seems inadequate to describe these  extraordinary experiences.
  
  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Associated life threatening event.&nbsp;  The threat may be real or perceived, physical and/or  psychological.
  
  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Separation of consciousness from the body.&nbsp;  Sensation of viewing surroundings from a place other than the  physical body. Some may see their bodies from a distance.&nbsp; Feeling the  &quot;self &quot; is hovering overhead.
  
  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ability&nbsp; to see and hear details of events  (which may be close or distant from the body) while unconscious.&nbsp; These details (which may include a pronouncement of death)  are often later confirmed by others who are generally astonished and mystified  that the experiencer was aware of these events while unconscious.
  
  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experiencing  intensely powerful emotions.&nbsp; These emotions may include ecstasy, fear, peace and calm.

6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing  distinctive sounds.&nbsp; Experiencers may report &nbsp;hearing a variety of unusual  sounds or noise.&nbsp; They may be described as pleasant, musical, buzzing or  ringing.
  
  7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passing into and through a dark tunnel.&nbsp;There may be feelings of floating into a cave, enclosure or  void. &nbsp; Movement may accelerate in the tunnel.&nbsp; Occasionally another  being(s) accompany this tunnel passage, though usually it is traveled alone.&nbsp;  A bright light is usually seen at the end of the tunnel, and is the destination  of the travel through the tunnel.
  
  8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encounter with a bright light.&nbsp;  The light is often perceived as a being, either a spiritual  being or a departed loved one.&nbsp; The being is often described as intensely  loving.

9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meeting  others.&nbsp; The experiencer may encounter other spiritual beings or  departed loved ones.&nbsp;

10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life review.&nbsp;  At times, experiencers are presented with a rapid panoramic  review of their lives.&nbsp; This review is very rapid, often extremely  detailed, and often includes a presentation of how the experiencers actions  affected others around them.&nbsp; Some have received previously unknown  information about ones life, i.e. adoption, hidden parentage or deceased  siblings.

11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing or  visiting beautiful locations.&nbsp; Some experiencers travel to beautiful cities, libraries,  gardens, pastoral scenes and shiny bodies of water.

12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sense of  knowing universal order and purpose.&nbsp; Some experience have a sense of deep understanding of the  universe and/or life's meaning and purpose.

13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reaching a  boundary.&nbsp; The boundary may be a gate, cliff, fence, water, or some  other barrier which the experiencer perceives may not be crossed if   returned to the body.

14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Awareness of  future life events.&nbsp; Although rare, some experiencers have&quot;flash-forwards&quot; in  time to witness themselves and events at a later time in their life.&nbsp;

15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decision to  return.&nbsp; The decision to return to the physical body may be voluntary  or involuntary.&nbsp; If voluntary, the decision to return is often made  following discussion with spiritual beings and is often associated with  unfinished life responsibilities.&nbsp; If involuntary, feelings of sadness,  loss, depression and anxiety may follow.&nbsp;

16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returning to  the body.&nbsp; Feelings of pain associated with the life threatening injury  return.

17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special  gifts.&nbsp; Some experiencers report psychic or other paranormal  abilities after an NDE.

18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes of  attitudes and beliefs.&nbsp; A belief in God, loss of fear of death and a more  loving interaction with others often follow an NDE. &nbsp; Some NDE experiencers  establish more loving relationships.&nbsp; Other NDE experiencers find their  change in attitudes and beliefs may alter previously established interpersonal  relationship dynamics resulting in conflict with loved ones, family and friends.
