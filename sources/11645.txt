  		              		Experience Description   

    I was admitted to the hospital at 37-weeks pregnant for an induction due to high blood pressure and symptoms of pre-eclampsia. After about 40 hours of the induction, baby’s heart rate started to dip. My blood pressure had also risen to where I was now considered pre-eclamptic. The decision was made to do an emergency c-section. I already had an epidural so we wheeled in ready to go. I remember started to freak out a little - I also hadn’t slept in 48-60 hours or eaten. I was ready to meet my baby but also to be done. I remember asking the nurse for something to help calm me down as I was so scared. The anesthesiologist told me he could give me something but that I might not remember the birth. I said that was fine as I was too agitated and nearing a panic attack. 

  My timeline is fuzzy from here on out. 

  About 15 minutes after they gave me something to calm me down, my partner was permitted to enter the room. I don’t remember seeing her or us taking at all. I remember telling the nurse I was going to throw up, she said I wasn’t, and then I did. I also was shaking so badly they had to strap my arms down. Around this time is when I had this experience. All of a sudden I was watching the surgery from above, like a corner of the room. I wasn’t shaking anymore and was very warm, almost like I was being hugged. My entire body felt warm and comfy, like I was under the most amazing blanket.

  I then was in a tunnel of sorts. All around me was bright white lights, but not blinding. Like a glow. And there was a woman there. I knew who she was without knowing her name. Like in the moment it made complete sense SHE was there but now looking back I’ve never met her. It is 100% possible this is my grandmother who died before I was born and for whom I’m named. She said to me, you can keep walking towards me. But if you do you’ll reach the point you can’t go back. You’ll reach the point of no return. And I said something like but it’s so cozy here. And she said yes. But your girls need you. You need to decide. And I remember it being a very hard decision, I wanted to stay in that place forever.

   But I then remember her fading away and I became aware of my body again and my wife was slapping my face screaming. She was saying someone help there’s something wrong. She said I got a look on my face that looked like I had died and it scared her. She told the doctors who said I was fine, they were monitoring me, etc. but she said she knew me and there was something wrong so she took it upon herself to slap me! Around the same time, I asked about the baby. The nurse said she would be out soon. I then remember them telling me she was out but heard nothing. I started yelling 'why isn’t she crying? Someone tell me why she isn’t crying!!' And about a minute later, she did. A very cute cry too! They later told us she was born asleep and they had to really wake her up to get her to cry. 

  After the surgery was complete they wheeled us into recovery. I told my wife and the nurse immediately what happened. My wife believed me, as she saw my face, but the nurse said it might’ve been the sedative they gave me, nothing happened to my vitals etc. It took me awhile to share the experience again. When I finally did with my mother, she said when giving birth to me she had a similar experience. Eerily similar. She had never told me that story, only that when giving birth she hemorrhaged and almost died. She said she never shared her experience after someone laughed at her. Since telling my mom, I have become fascinated by the experience. Was it the sedative? Who was the woman? Why did I want to stay so badly? What would’ve happened if I did?
