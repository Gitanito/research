Initially, each number was a separate pamphlet consisting of one long article, but over time these were supplemented with reviews of journals and books.  Tyner was a dynamo of energy.  He edited this journal in 1897-1898, advertising himself and his wife, Mathilde Hoehn Tyner, as "Metaphysicians" who practiced "Healing and Mastery of all Conditions by Scientific Methods," offering "Lessons and Treatments by Correspondence in English or German."  In 1898, he bought a controlling interest in B.O. Flower's Arena, merging this journal into it, and edited that for two years, and went on to start and organize Mental Science Temples and Schools of Applied Metaphysics in New York and New Thought reading rooms across the country.  He is, however, a far more complex figure than his New Thought connections might indicate.  He figures in Richard Maurice Bucke's Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind (1901; New York: E.P. Dutton & Co., 1945), 351ss., because of his overpowering experience in 1895 of the indwelling of the Christ in his body.  He also was obsessed with "Physical Immortality" (the title of the first issue of The Temple) and with the role of sex in spiritual development: "In the supreme development of sex in humanity, must be found, I think, the key to immortality."  This meant, as he opined in later articles, "regeneration through recognition and development of the higher nature and potencies of sex-through its elevation and spiritualization."  With these thoughts as predicate, it is no surprise that the journal featured the ramblings of Freeman B. Dowd, under his own name and as "Rosicruciae," arguing that "Sex is of the body, soul and spirit," and "The union of two souls in one completes the circle of Generation and ushers in the new cycle of Re-generation."  The journal also featured poems by Lucy L. Stout Dowd, who was Dowd's wife and the initiator (under the name "Sorona") in his brotherhood of the Rosy Cross.  In an early issue, Rosicruciae announced the formation of a Bureau of Instruction for Applications of the Western Cult of the Rosy Cross-which could be contacted by writing the editor of The Temple.  The journal was largely written by Tyner but also carried contributions by Helen Campbell, the Dowds, Hudor Genone, Joaquin Miller (poem), Katherine H. Newcomb, et al., and regular advertisements for like-minded New Thought sexual mages and their works: Nancy McKay Gordon, Charles H. Mackay, Parzival Braun's New Man, M.E. Cramer's Harmony, H.E. Butler's Esoteric, the Phelons' Hermetist, together with a review of Peter Davidson's Morning Star.  The Temple otherwise was a mixture of optimistic New Thought, women's liberation, and translations from Emile Zola and Karl Marx.  NYPL; LOC; University of Michigan.
