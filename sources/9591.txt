I was in a coma for three days and during this time, I died three times. At the hospital during the times, I did not show any vital signs I remember hearing the nurses and doctors talking about my condition and the various procedures they were using to try to get me back to life. After each episode, I would wake and ask the nurses and doctors, 'what certain procedures were' and I called them by name. The doctors were stunned and some nurses left the room crying. During each episode, I floated above my body, rose up, went to the window, and looked out at a bright summer day. Then floated back to above my bed and overhead what the medical teams were doing to get me back to life. I thought I was dreaming but I could recite all the procedures by name and the medical teams were stunned because I never went to medical school obviously, so they could not explain it.
