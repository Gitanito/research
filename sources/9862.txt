  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  I had lost a lot of blood. I remember floating, and watching from above the scene of panic by hospital staff as I flat lined, I felt it was quite humorous.

Date NDE Occurred: 	 1978  

NDE Elements:     

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Yes   Illness        Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function or brain function)   Floating away, felt great. Until I realized I had been bought around and described by doctors as dead.  

How do you consider the content of your experience?      Wonderful  

Did you feel separated from your body?    Yes    I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?      Normal consciousness and alertness   I kind of went 'out' when I was injected with something by a doctor I would say.

Were your senses more vivid than usual?       Neither  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.     Kind of 'floaty' and in slow motion - but it seems normal to you at the time.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.    Not really. It's a little bit hard to explain, you are floating above people trying to eavesdrop, but really don't care so much that you can't hear what they are saying because you feel a little bit hyped up in a way.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere?     Neither

What emotions did you feel during the experience?       Pissed off when I awoke in pain with a bloody great wound.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?       Relief or calmness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?       Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?     United, one with the world  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?       Everything about the universe       

Did scenes from your past come back to you?       Neither     I learned not to be afraid of death, and I see tons of shit now that I don't want to know. I know who's on the other end of the phone before I pick it up - I don't want to know what I know.  

Did scenes from the future come to you?       Neither       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       Neither

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       Yes     When I go to sleep. I am inundated with faces that are screaming to me to please help them. This, I have learned to control, as they are desperate trying to get through to their families - or so I've been told.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        I am not afraid to die. I just don't want to go yet!  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     No      

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real     When I followed my hospital bed being pushed by nurses to emergency theatre, I awoke two days later to be told by nurses that I had actually died.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real     I felt okay. It was a nice feeling. But I'm glad I survived.
