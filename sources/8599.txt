  Editorial Review:   by Jody
    This is a great little book for those who   have lost people who are close to them.&nbsp; Kay lends her psychologist   background combined with the loss of her son to talk about bereavement and after   death communication.&nbsp; There is a lot of history and other perspectives as   well.&nbsp; This is a must read for people who are interested in after death   communication.&nbsp; It is also very heartening for those grieving for the loss   of a loved one.

  In a   compelling examination of post-death communication, transpersonal counselor and   certified hypnotherapist, Dr. Kay Woods, offers an in-depth exploration of the   phenomena of post-death communication.
