I was hit by a car.  After I was hit, I saw an old man in robes and a walking stick.  He needed some help. I helped him to walk over and sit under a tree in the green grass. Where I was hit, there were neither trees nor any green grass. It was a large crop field that had nothing growing, just brown dirt. Then I turned, looked around, and said, 'I have to help those retards get that guy into the ambulance.'  The person going into ambulance was me. I remember bouncing around in the ambulance as they started driving.  Then I fell into my body.  I woke up in Sicilian hospital.
