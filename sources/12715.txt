I sat up in bed grabbed my brother by the neck. Next thing I know I'm standing with this other guy in the hall and I'm laughing at the monitor that is flat and I'm thinking wait till that guy figures out what's going on. Then my brother turns and looks out into the hall, next thing I'm really warm absolutely no pain and I'm thinking like I've never felt so positive in thought. Then I'm lying on the bed and everyone is talking to me. I'm thinking that it's Chinese or something. Anyway then, I'm in the hall and on a bed when I wake up this guy is jumping up in the air and hitting me, the only thing I can think is I don't even know this person what did I do to him? Then a couple of days later I wake up in the hospital recovery.
