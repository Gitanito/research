  		          OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCES (OBEs)

  By Barbara Mango, Ph.D.

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Nearly all non-materialist researchers are   in agreement that the OBE, or separation of consciousness from the physical   body, is one of the most scientifically verifiable aspects of the NDE. &nbsp;   Nelson defines an OBE as a “disembodied sensation   from a perspective different from the body’s actual location” [5]   &nbsp;   The Free   Dictionary  defines ‘disembodied’ as “to free   the soul or spirit”, or “to divest of material substance”. Non-materialists   identify this as non-local
  
  consciousness, and posit this phenomena is directly linked to OBEs. &nbsp;   During an OBE, individuals witness their own   resuscitation most often from a position both outside and above their bodies.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    OBEs provide compelling evidence for the validity of the   NDE as numerous stories recalled by subjects have been independently   corroborated. One of the strongest case studies supporting veridical perception   was recorded by Kenneth Ring, psychologist and co-founder of the International   Association of Near-Death Studies (commonly referred to as IANDS). &nbsp;   Ring’s subject, Maria, was a migrant worker   visiting Seattle for the first time. &nbsp;   While visiting, she was rushed to the hospital   after suffering a massive heart attack. While recuperating in the coronary care   unit, she went into cardiac arrest and was declared clinically dead. She was   successfully resuscitated a few minutes later.

Maria related her OBE to Kimberly, her critical care social   worker.&nbsp;  Maria described herself   rising above her body and “floating” to a window on the third floor of the   hospital’s north wing.&nbsp;  Sitting on   the window ledge was a man’s left-footed, blue sneaker, which she described in   minute detail as having a worn little toe and shoelace tucked under its sole.&nbsp;   Anxious to corroborate her story, she asked Kimberly to search for the   sneaker.&nbsp;

    Kimberly located the blue sneaker on a third floor ledge, exactly as Maria had   described it.&nbsp;  In recounting the   story Kimberly stated, “The only way she could have had such a perspective was   if she had been floating right outside and at very close range to the tennis   shoe.&nbsp;  I retrieved the shoe and   brought it back to Maria; it was very concrete evidence for me.” [6]          &nbsp;  Ring   contends:

    Now, on hearing a case like this one has to ask:&nbsp;   What is the probability that a migrant worker visiting a large city for   the first time, who suffers a heart attack and is rushed to a hospital at night   would, while having a cardiac arrest, simply “hallucinate” seeing a tennis   shoe--with very specific and unusual features--on the ledge of a floor  higher than her physical location in the hospital?&nbsp;   Only an arch-skeptic, I think, would say anything much other than, “Not   bloody likely!” [7]

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         A further narrative was reported to Kenneth Ring by Joyce Harmon, an ICU nurse   at Hartford Hospital.&nbsp;  She arrived at   the hospital wearing a brand new pair of sneakers with plaid shoelaces.&nbsp;   Later that day Harmon was assisting in the surgery of a female patient   who coded, yet was later revived. The following day she (the patient), recalled   her experience to Harmon.

    “Oh, you’re the one with the plaid shoelaces!” &nbsp; “What?”   Harmon replied, astonished.&nbsp;  She   distinctly remembers feeling the hair on her neck rise.&nbsp;   “I saw them, the woman [patient] continued.&nbsp;   “I was watching what happened yesterday when I died.&nbsp;   I was above.” [8]    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         In another astonishing interview, an Australian subject described her experience   to Ring:

    I will never forget the look on the surgeon’s face when I told him that I went   through the OBE phenomenon during the operation.&nbsp;   I then asked the surgeon whether he was sitting on a green stool with a   white top on it. He replied yes. He then said, “But you could not have seen that   from where you were lying on the operating table.” I then said to him that I did   not see that from where I was lying, but that I had seen it from where I was   detached from my body looking down from above during this NDE phenomenon.&nbsp;   This remark caused an even stranger look on his face [9]    &nbsp;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         An additional factor that makes these accounts so extraordinary is that each of   the aforementioned subjects describe viewing both themselves   and others from a perspective impossible with normal visual perception. Long and   Perry have noted that nearly all subjects report having  greater than 360 degree vision.&nbsp;   As they explain, “… NDErs often report spherical, three-dimensional   visual awareness simultaneously in all directions—forward, backward, right,   left, above, and below”.  [10]

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Researchers Kenneth Ring and Sharon Cooper have termed this “omnidirectional   awareness”, and describe this phenomena in the following interview:

  I   could see everything. &nbsp;   And I do mean everything! &nbsp;   I could see the light on the ceiling, and the   underside of the stretcher. &nbsp;   I could see the tiles on the ceiling and the tiles   on the floor, simultaneously. &nbsp;   Three hundred and sixty degree spherical vision. &nbsp;   And not just spherical. &nbsp;   Detailed! &nbsp;   I could see every single hair and follicle out of   which it grew on the head of the nurse standing beside the stretcher. &nbsp;   At the time I knew exactly how many hairs there   were to look at.   [11]    &nbsp;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Ring contends these visual accounts “have a strong emotional and cognitive   impact on the investigators involved—either strengthening their preexisting   belief in the authenticity of NDEs or occasioning a kind of on-the-spot   conversion.  [12]

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Materialist science, however, adamantly disagrees with the findings of Ring,   Cooper, Long, et.al.&nbsp;        British psychologist Susan Blackmore strongly disagrees with Ring’s research.&nbsp;   She states:

    I WANT TO BE QUITE CLEAR.&nbsp;  It is my   contention that there is no soul, spirit, astral body or anything at all that   leaves the body during NDEs and survives after death.&nbsp;   These, like the very idea of persisting self, are all illusions and the   NDE can be accounted for without recourse to any of them” [13]      &nbsp;&nbsp;

Instead, Blackmore postulates that OBEs are reconstructions   of memories as the patient is losing or regaining consciousness.&nbsp;   In Dying to Live Blackmore   argues that sensory stimuli and projection of imagery make memory reconstruction   probable. As she asserts:

    Unconsciousness is not an all-or-nothing phenomena.&nbsp;   A person may appear unresponsive, but still be able to hear.&nbsp;   From hearing alone we can construct extremely convincing visual pictures [14]

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Blackmore additionally claims numerous patients have had past procedures and are   thus familiar with surgical procedure, medical terminology, and the visual   layout of an operating room.&nbsp;  Armed   with this awareness, patients may create imagined scenarios based on information   gathered before surgery. Thus, materialists theorize that OBEs are merely a   function of prior knowledge, hearing, and imaginative reconstruction.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Non-materialists, however, find many holes in this theory.&nbsp;   As cardiologist and NDE researcher Pim van Lommel explains,

    Although sounds and other stimuli continue to enter the brains of these   patients, they no longer trigger the kinds of responses that are registered   during conscious experiences under normal circumstances because the connections   in the brain have been severed and information can no longer be exchanged. [15]

He continues by stating:

    From a scientific point of view it therefore seems highly unlikely that under   properly administered anesthesia patients can have memories of the surgical   period with lucid consciousness, with thoughts and emotions, and sometimes with   perceptions from a position above the operating table…and yet, this exceptional   situation exists. [16]       .&nbsp;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Furthermore, NDErs are often unresponsive when no one else is present, making   conversation recollection impossible.

    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Third   party verification of patient accounts challenges traditional theory and remains   inexplicable to most scientists. Thus, OBES are highly suggestive of a   transcendent, or non-local consciousness, supporting the non-materialist   paradigm.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         As Ring asserts:

    The perceptions are just too fine-grained in their details and too telling their   appropriateness—they are just the kind of thing one would expect to be reported   if individuals really were able to see   with extraordinary clarity from an elevated position near the ceiling—to be   glibly written off on the grounds that they are simply not possible.
