INTRODUCTION .
The following Essay was written origin
ally
for
a
Literary Society
,
to
prove
the
reality
of
Ghosts
,
and
by
accounting
for
their appearance from natural causes
,
to
remove those impressions
of
terror which
are made upon the minds
of
youth
,
when
apparitions are supposed
to
be
preter
natural
.
This subject was illustrated
by
a
num
ber
of
cases
,
drawn from the author
'
s
own experience
,
and which cases were
ali
of
them
capable
of
being authenticated
at
the time
by
the members
of
the
so
ciety
.
yiii INTRODUCTION .
It was read in manuscript for several
years afterwards, in different places , and
was published , unknown to the author, in
the Edinburgh Medical and Chirurgical
Journal , in the year 1810 .
From the notice which
his
peculiar
hypothesis obtained
at
the time
,
the
au
thor was led
to
believe
it
had drawn the
attention
of
the public
,
and hereprinted
it
in
1811 with some necessary correc
tions
,
and added
it
to
a
fourth edition
of
his Essay
on
the Rhus Toxicodendron
,
then
in
the press
.
In
1813
,
an
eminent
and learned physician
'
at
Manchester
published
as
new the same theory
,
sup
ported
by
ancient history and traditional
stories
,
which
,
if
not equivocal
,
could
not
be
so
well authenticated
as
those
to
be found
in
the following essay
.
INTRODUCTION . ix
As no notice whatever was taken of
his
publication
,
the author has been
in
duced
,
at
the recommendation
of
his
friends
,
to
republish
it
in
a
more book
-
like
form
,
not only
to
prevent
all
suspicion
of
plagiarism
,
but
to
assert his claim
,
and
show
his
right
to
whatever novelty
or
merit there may
be
in
the theory itself
.

He thinks himself fully entitled

14 AN ESSAY
of those who have departed this
life
,
could
not
,
in
all
cases
,
have arisen from the
transmission
of
the poetic inventions
of
former times
; because countries have
been discovered
,
where we cannot sup
pose
,
or
at
least cannot trace
,
any pre
vious race
of
men
,
of
superior intelligence
,
capable
,
like Homer
or
Ossian
,
of
trans
mitting the records
of
antiquity
;
and
,
with regard
to
the intervention
of
super
natural agency
,
in
communicating
or
re
vealing knowledge
to
men
,
it
behoves
us
,
I
think
,
to
keep
in
mind
an
old
maxim
,
Nec Deus intersit nisi dignus vindice
nodus
:
"
Let
us
take care never
to
in
troduce the miraculous agency
of
Provi
dence
to
account
for
effects
,
where com
mon agents
by
natural causes can
be
found
.
Nor ought
we
hastily
to
abandon
our inquiries after such second causes
,
ON APPARITIONS. 15
merely because we may be told that they
are mysteries . At the same time, we
have much cause to be thankful to the
Almighty Governor of
all
things
,
when
such circumstances and events dispose
the wicked
to
turn from the error
of
their
ways
,
as
in
the case
of
ColonelGardiner
;
or
when they tend
to
strengthen and en
courage
the
good
in
the
way
of
well
doing
,
as
in
the instance
of
the truly
re
spected
,
the Reverend Vincent Perronet
.
*
*
The remarkable conversion
of
Colonel Gar
diner
,
by
an
apparition
,
is
sufficiently well known
.
The history
of
Mr
.
Perronet
+
requires further
He was the grandfather and instructor
of
my inesti
mable friend
,
the late Mrs
.
Thompson
,
who imbibed
,
under
his tuition
,
those Christian principles
,
which she unre
mittingly exemplified
in
practice during life
.
In
the dis
charge
of
one
of
these duties
,
she accompanied her lovely
and beloved daughter
to
Penzance
,
in
search
of
that health
for her which had been despaired
of
at
home
.
She was
prevented
,
by
premature death
,
in
an
apoplectic
fit
,
from
witnessing the last distressing scene
:
-
her daughter out
lived her but
a
short time
.
They were buried
in
the
same vault
at
the Land
'
s
End
,
"
Where they alike
in
pious hope repose
.
16 AN ESSAY
The re-appearance of departed spirits,
however , is generally attributed to the
notice . He was upwards of fifty years vicar of
Shoreham ,in Kent, was a very amiable man ,and a
popular preacher . "
He seems to have considered himself as especi
ally called , from
his
earliest years
,
to
the
study
of
the Scriptures
,
with
a
view
of
preaching the true
gospel
of
Christ
.
Hehad several spiritual
ex
periences
,
through the medium
of
apparitions
,
which made
a
lasting impression
on
his mind
,
though not attended with any fright
or
terror
.
When
he
was
an
infant
,
about four years
of
age
,
he
was waked
in
the night
by
something lying
on
his forehead
,
which felt like the impression
of
a
very cold hand
.
It
continued some time after
he
was awake
,
when
he
perceived
a
tall man close
to
the bed
-
side
,
who looked very sternly
at
him
.
Much about this time
he
saw
another person
standing
on
the opposite side
of
the bed
,
dressed
in
very mean apparel
,
whose aspect seemed earnest
,
serious
,
and composed
.
However
,
what the design
of
either
of
these appearances might
be
,
he
pre
tends not
to
know
.
When
he
was between five
and
six
years
old
,
being
on
a
visit
to
some
of
his
father
'
s
relations
in
Switzerland
,
he
was travelling
ON APPARITIONS. 17
concealment of some trifling treasure, or
because the rites
and
fees
of
sepulture
have not been duly paid
.
But
if
the flinty prison
of
the grave
Could loose
its
doors
,
and
let
the spirit fee
;
Why not return the wise
,
the just
,
the brave
,
And set once more the pride
of
ages free
?
"
t
retu
over some high mountains
on
horseback
,
but
through the neglect
of
the guide
,
who had the care
of
his
horse
,
instead
of
pursuing the proper road
,
the horse directed his course towards
a
large
lake
;
but before
he
entered
,
he
saw very plainly
one like
a
man
,
in
a
white garment
,
coming upon
the water towards
him
:
upon which the horse
turned away
,
and
got
into the right road again
.
The first step
he
had taken into the lake
,
both the
horse and the rider must have been inevitably lost
,
as
he was afterwards informed
.
One night
in
particular
,
when
he
was broad
awake
,
he
heard
a
variety
of
disagreeable voices
,
and
felt several blows from invisible hands
;
so
that
he
might literally have said
,
The messengers
of
Satan were sent
to
buffet
him
.
18 AN ESSAY
I need only quote the authority of one
of our most approved writers , without
referring to a tribe of authors,
for
the
proof
of
the universality
of
this
be
-
,
lief
.
:
I
think
,
says Addison
,
a
person
who
is
terrified with the imagination
of
ghosts and spectres
,
much more reason
able than one
,
who
,
contrary
to
the
re
ports
of
all
historians
,
sacred and pro
fane
,
ancient and modern
,
and
to
the
traditions
of
all
nations
,
thinks the ap
pearance
of
ghosts fabulous and ground
less
.
Could not
I
give myself
up
to
this
general testimony
of
mankind
,
I
should
to
the
relations
of
particular persons
,
who
are now living
,
and whom
I
cannot dis
trust
in
other matters
of
fact
.
In
the
paragraph which
I
have now quoted
,
you
have not only
a
record
of
history
,
as
to
the
ON APPARITIONS. 19
universality of the belief , but the candid
confession of a man of the first talents,
that he firmly believed in ghosts and ap
paritions , though he has not favoured us
with any theory respecting their origin .
Is it not mortifying to know that such
a man as Luther was a
firm
believer
in
apparitions
as
supernatural agents; and
that
he
should suppose madmen and idiots
to
be
possessed
by
evil spirits
;
nay
,
that
he
should actually have quarrelled with
the
physicians
,
who attributed these affec
tions
to
natural causes
?

CHAPTER II.
STATEMENT OF FACTS UPON WHICH THE HY
POTHESIS IS MEANT TO BE FOUNDED . :
CASES . - TREATMENT AND CURE .
In the investigation of any subject, it is
generally the best method to begin by a
statement of the facts upon which the
hypothesis is meant to be founded . I
shall, therefore , in this chapter, present
some cases
for
the consideration
of
my
readers
,
which will
,
in
my opinion
,
strongly tend
to
account
for
the univer
sality
of
the notion mentioned
in
the pre
ceding chapter
;
for
they will prove
,
that
the belief
in
apparitions
,
ghosts
,
and
spectres
,
is
not only well founded
,
but
ON APPARITIONS.
21
that these appearances are perfectly na
tural, arising from secondary physical
causes, and depending on circumstances
to which
all
nations
,
all
mankind
,
are
equally liable
;
and therefore
a
general
concurrence
of
opinion
on
these points
must
be
as
universal
as
the principle
of
population itself
.
CASE
I
.
I
was called upon some time ago
to
visit Mr
.
who
at
that time kept
a
dram shop
.
Having
at
different times
attended
him
,
and thence knowing
him
very well
,
I
was struck with something
singular
in
his manner
on
my first
en
trance
.
Hewent
up
stairs with me
,
but
evidently hesitated
,
occasionally
,
as
he
went
.
When
he
got into his chamber
,
he
expressed some apprehension
,
lest
I
BS
22 AN ESSAY
should consider him insane , and send
him
to
the asylum
at
York
,
whither
I
had
not long before sent one
of
his
pot
-
compa
nions
.
Whence
all
these apprehen
sions
?
-
What
is
thematter with you
?
Why
do
you look
so
full
of
terror
?
"
He
then
sat
down
,
and gave me
a
history
of
his complaint
.
About
a
week
or
ten
days before
,
after
drawing some liquor
in
his
cellar
for
a
girl
,
he
desired her
to
take away
the
oysters which lay upon the floor
,
and
which
he
supposed
she
had
dropped
;
the girl
,
thinking him drunk
,
laughed
at
him
,
and went out
of
the room
.
He en
deavoured
to
take them
up
himself
,
and
to
his great astonishment could find none
.
-
He was met going out
of
the cellar
,
when
at
the door
he
met
a
soldier
,
whose
looks
he
did not like
,
attempting
to
enter
.
ON APPARITIONS. 23
He desired to know whathe wanted there ;
and upon receiving no answer ,but, as he
thought , a menacing look , he sprang for
ward to seize the intruder , and , to his no
small surprise , found that it was a phantom .
The cold sweat hung upon
his
brow
-
he
trembled
in
every limb
it
was the dusk
of
the evening
;
as
he
walked along the
passage the phantom fitted before
his
eyes
he
attempted
to
follow
it
,
reso
lutely determined
to
satisfy himself
;
but
as
this vanished
,
there appeared others
at
a
distance
,
and
he
exhausted himself
by
fruitless attempts
to
lay hold
of
them
.
He hastened
to
his
family
,
with marks
of
terror and confusion
;
for
,
though
a
man
hitherto
of
themost undaunted resolution
,
he
confessed
to
me that
he
now felt what
it
was
to
be
completely terrified
.
During
B
4
· AN ESSAY ;
the whole of that nighthe was constantly
tormented with a variety of spectres,
sometimes of people who had been long
dead , at other times of friends who were
living ; and harassed himself with con
tinually getting out of bed, to ascertain
whether the people he saw were real or
not. Nor could he always distinguish
who were and who were not real cus
tomers, when they came into the room ,
so that
his
conduct became the subject
of
observation
;
and though
it
was for
a
time
attributed
to
private drinking
,
it
was
at
last suspected
to
arise from some other
cause
.
When
I
was sent
for
,
the family
were under the full conviction that
he
was
insane
,
although they confessed
,
that
in
every thing
,
except the foolish notion
of
seeing apparitions
,
he
was perfectly
ra
tional and steady
.
During the whole
of
ON APPARITIONS. 25
as
the time that he was relating
his
case
to
me
,
and his mind was fully occupied
,
he
felt the most gratifying relief
,
for
in
all
that time
he
had not seen one apparition
;
and
he
was elated with pleasure indeed
,
when
I
told
him
I
should not send
him
to
the
asylum
,
since
his
was
a
complaint
I
could cure
at
his own house
.
But whilst
I
was writing
a
prescription
,
and had suf
fered him
to
be
at
rest
,
I
saw him get
up
suddenly
,
and
go
with
a
hurried step
to
the door
.
What
did
you
do
that
for
p
-
he
looked ashamed and mortified
,
and
replied
,
I
had been
so
wellwhilst
in
con
versation with you
,
that
I
could not be
lieve that the phantom
I
saw enter the
room was not really
a
soldier
,
and
I
got
up
to
convince myself
.
I
need not here detail particularly the
medical treatment adopted
;
but
it
may
26 AN ESSAY
be as well to state the circumstances
which probably
led
to
the
complaint
,
and
the principle acted
on
in
the
cure
.
Some
time previously
he
had had
a
quarrel with
a
drunken soldier
,who attempted
,
against
his inclination
,
to
enter
his
house
at
an
unseasonable hour
,
and in the struggle
to
turn
him
out
,
the soldier drew
his
bay
onet
,
and
,
having struck
him
across the
temples
,
divided
the
temporal artery
;
in
consequence
of
which
he
lost
a
very large
quantity
of
blood before
a
surgeon
ar
rived
,
there being
no
one present who
knew that
,
in
such cases
,
simple com
pression with the finger upon the spouting
artery
,
would stop the effusion
of
blood
.
He had scarcely recovered from the
effects
of
this loss
of
blood
,
when
he
un
dertook
to
accompany
a
friend
in
his
walking
-
match against time
,
in
which
he
ON APPARITIONS . 277
went forty -two miles in nine hours .
Elated with success, he spent the whole
of the following day in drinking ; but
found himself , a short time afterwards ,
so much out of health, that he came to
the resolution of abstaining altogether
from liquor. It was in the course of the
week following this abstinence from
his
usual habits
,
that
he
had the disease he
now complained
of
.
All his symptoms
continued
to
increase
for
several days
till
I
saw
him
,
allowing
him
no
time
for
rest
.
Never was
he
able
to
get
rid
of
these
shadows
by
night when
in
bed
,
nor
by
day when
in
motion
;
though
he
some
times walked miles with that view
,
and
at
others went
into
a
variety
of
company
.
He told me
he
suffered even bodily pain
,
from
the
severe lashing
of
a
waggoner
with
his
whip
,
who came every night
to
28 AN ESSAY
a particular corner of his room , but who
always disappeared when he jumped
out of bed to retort , which he did se
veral nights successively . The whole of
this complaint was effectually removed
by bleeding , by leeches, and by active
purgatives . After the first employment
of these means, he
saw
no
more phan
toms
in
the day
'
time
;
and after
the
second
,
once only
,
between sleeping and
waking
,
saw the milkman
in
his bedroom
.
He has remained perfectly rational and
well ever since
,
and can
go
out
in
the dark
as
fearlessly
as
ever
,
being fully convinced
that
the
ghosts which
he
was
so
confident
he
saw
,
were merely the creatures
of
dis
ease
.
CASE
II
.
I
was soon after called
to
visit Mrs
.
B
.
,
a
fine
old
lady
,
about
80
years
of
age
,
whom
ON APPARITIONS. 29
I had frequently visited in
fits
of
the gout
.
She was seized with
an
unusual deafness
,
and with great distension
of
the organs
of
digestion
,
at
a
period
,
when
,
from her
general feelings
,
she expected the gout
.
From this time she was visited
by
the
phantoms
of
some
of
her friends
,
whom
she had not invited
,
and
whom
she
at
first
so
far
considered
as
actually present
,
that she told them she was very sorry she
could not hear them speak
,
nor keep
up
the conversation with them
,
she would
therefore order the card table
;
and she
rang the bell
for
that purpose
.
Upon
the entrance
of
the servant
,
the whole
party disappeared
she
could not help
expressing her surprise
to
her maid that
they should
all
go
away
so
abruptly
;
and could scarcely believe her when she
affirmed there had been nobody
in
the
30 AN ESSAY
i
VI .
room . She was so ashamed , when con
vinced of the deception under which she
laboured , that she suffered , without com
plaining ,
for
many days
and
nights toge
ther
,
the
intrusion
of
a
variety
of
phan
toms
;
and had some ofher finest feelings
wrought upon
by
the exhibition
of
friends
long lost
,
who only came to cheat her
fancy
,
and revive sensations that time had
almost obliterated
.
Having determined
notagain
to
mention the subject
,
she con
tented herself with merely ringing her
bell
,
finding she could always
get
rid
of
the
phantoms
by
the
entrance
of
her
maid
,
whenever they became distressing
.
It
was not
till
some time after she had
thus suffered
,
that
she
could bring her
self
to
relate her distress
to
me
.
She was
all
this time convinced
of
her own ration
ality
,
and
so
were those friendswho really
ON APPARITIONS. 31
visited her ;
for
they never could find
any one circumstance
in
her conduct and
conversation
,
to
lead them
to
suspect her
being
in
the
smallest degree deranged
,
though unwell
.
This complaint was en
tirely removed
by
cataplasms
to
the feet
,
and gentle purgatives
;
and terminated
,
à
short timeafterwards
,
in
a
slight
fit
of
the
gout
.
She remained
to
the
end
of her
life
,
in
the perfect enjoyment
of
her health
and faculties
.
CASE

About the same period
I
visited Mr

R

,
who was seized
on
his
passage from
America with
a
most excruciating head
·
ache
.
He obtained some temporary relief
from the formation
of
matter under the
scalp
;
but swellings came
on
in
the
throat
,
and
he
had some difficulty
of
re
spiration when
in
bed
.
At this time he
32 AN ESSAY
.
en
complained to me that he had trouble
some dreams, and that he seemed to
dream whilst awake . In a short time
after this, he told me he had ,
for
an
hour
or
two
,
been convinced that he had seen
his
wife and family
, when
his
right judg
ment told him that they were
in
America
;
a
few
nights afterwards
,
the impression
was
so
strong
,
and the conversation
he
had with
his
son
so
very particular and
important
,
that
he
could not help relating
the whole
to
his
friends
in
themorning
,
requesting
to
know
if
his wife and son
were not actually arrived from America
,
and
at
that time
in
the house
.
I
was
sent for
to
hold
a
consultation with his
friends
,
respecting the state
of
his
mind
.
He evidently felt that they
all
took
him
to
be
insane
.
As soon
as
I
entered the
room
,
he asked me
if
the disease he then
ON APPARITIONS. 33
laboured under could produce the ima
gination of spectres and apparitions . He
had been hitherto , he said , an unbeliever
in ghosts , but had certainly been tor
mented by spectres during the night,
when perfectly awake. He felt himself
sane, and his friends
all
acknowledged
,
that
,
in
every thing else
,
he
was
as
sound
in
mind
as
ever
he
was
in
his life
.
Having
explained
to
him
the nature and extent
of
his
complaint
,
and having assured him
,
that these visionary appearances would
cease with his bodily sufferings
,
he
and
his friends were rendered easy
in
their
minds
.
As
the disease
,
however
,
still
continued
,
the phantoms became after
wardsmore troublesome
,
so
that
he
could
not bear
to
go
into
his
bed
-
room
,
where
every picture was associated with them
,
conjuring
up
the spirits
of
the
departed
,
34 AN ESSAY
and introducing a train of unpleasant
companions. He remained after this in
a low room , and was for a time free from
intruders; but in a bright brass lock
again seeing
his
transatlantic friends
,
never afterwards could
he
look towards
it
without the same illusion
;
and when
I
have been with him
,
and have purposely
taken
up
a
book
,
I
have seen him hold
conversation
in
his
mind
'
s
eye with them
;
I
have even known him momentarily con
sider me
as
hearing and seeing them
too
-
I
say momentarily
,
for
he
was
a
man
of
strong parts
,
and perfectly convinced
of
the nature
of
the
complaint
;
therefore
,
whenever
I
spoke
,
and
he
turned from
the lock
,
he could converse
on
religion
,
physic
,
and politics
,
as
well
as
ever
.
He
then changed
his
house
;
the
matter again
formed under
his
scalp
,
and
he
is
now
in
ON APPARITIONS . 35
a state of convalescence, and totally free
from such visitations .
These people were
all
well
at
the time
this essay was first read
to
the society for
which
it
was originally written
,
and were
as
capable
as
I
am
of
relating
all
these
circumstances
:
they were convinced that
these were only phantoms
,
that had no
'
con
nection whatever with
the
persons they
represented
;
and that their existence was
only
in
their own disordered imaginations
.
But
I
am
persuaded
,
that had the diseases
under which they laboured gone
off
after
the first appearance
of
the
phantoms
,
or
had they been thus attacked
in
the night
only
,
so
terrified
,
so
astonished
,
so
con
vinced were they
of
their reality
,
(
as
ghosts
I
mean
,
)
that
no
power
on
earth
would ever have altered that opinion
'
:
nor could any
one
have satisfied them
O
c
2
36 AN ESSAY
that it was a disease under which they
themselves laboured ; so that they would
have passed through
life
with
the
full
persuasion of
having seen
a
ghost
,
in
the
common acceptation
of
the term
.
The
long continuance of the complaint
,
the
opportunities afforded
,
both
by
day
and
night
,
of
ascertaining the nature
of
the
appearances
,
and the full conviction pro
duced from their entire expulsion
by
remedies
,
without any delusion
,
or

tycism
,
or

,
dispelled every
idea
of

of

I

As
it

for

are

I
have been
at

CASE IV .
· I some time ago received the following
letter, in which
the
patient gives
a
full
account
of
his own case
:
I
am
oppressed by
a
complaint the
most extraordinary
I
ever heard
of
;
it
only afflicted me this morning
,
and has
occasionally shown itself during
the
day
.
My only complaint
is
that which gene
rally accompanies
a
series
of
hard living
;
I
can eat tolerably well
,
but
I
had
a
most
violent bilious attack the latter end
of
sometimes purposely
,
sometimes accidentally
,
and
which depend
on
mechanical and optical decep
tions
;
such
as
the reflection
of
persons passing
strong lights
on
a
hill
at
a
small distance
,
seen
obliquely
on
the church windows
,
and which has
the
appearance
of
ghosts flitting within
the
church
.
They are
all
as
easily explained
as
those
I
have
mentioned
;
but they have been explained
by
others
,
and form
no
part
of
my plan

morning 1 awoke early, after two very
unusually sleepless nights ,
and
to
my
surprise
I
saw
horrid
and
ghastly spectres
constantly present
to
my imagination
;
but
to
my greatest surprise
,
during
a
walk
in
my grounds
,
abo t eleven

,
I
fancied
I
saw
a
set

poachers
on

,
coursing
a
hare
.
I
followed them
on
foot
for
several miles
,
they being
present
to
my view
all
the time
.
As
they were
on
horseback
,
they
eluded my pursuit
.
Having returned
to
myhouse
,
I
again
saw
them
,
a
short time
afterwards
,
similarly occupied
in
the
front
of
my house
:
I
immediately
or
dered my horse
,
and again pursued them
for
miles
,
until
,
on
taking
a
large fence
,
I
suddenly
lost
all
sight
of
them
,
and
I
am
now fully convinced that
the
whole
ON APPARITIONS . 39
was an illusion . In my family affairs
and
business
I
am
competent
,
but very
un
comfortable
,
fearing
it
may affect my
intellect
.
I
therefore hope
to
see you
here
as
soon
as
possible this evening
.
I
forgot
to
say
,
that
,
when not very sober
,
I
had
a
fall from my horse
a
few
days
ago
,
but did not receive any material
in

at
the time

HALLUCINATION DISTINGUISHED FROM PARTIAL
INSANITY , FROM DELIRIUM , FROM SOMNAM
BULISM , FROM REVERIE . MAHOMET .
JACOB BEHMEN , AND OTHER VISIONARIES .
Having made out the universality of the
belief in ghosts , I trust that I have also
not only established the reality of such
appearances, but demonstrating , from
physical causes ,how this notion has arisen ,
have satisfactorily proved, that the cause
lies, not in the perturbed spirits of the
departed , but in the disordered functions
of
the
living
.
The hallucination
,
which the foregoing
cases detail
,
may
be
distinguished from
ON APPARITIONS. 41
partial insanity , from delirium , from som
nambulism , and from reverie , to
all
of
which
it
bears some resemblance
.
In
par
tial insanity
,
the patient
,
though sensible
on
most subjects
,
is
generally intent
on
one
particular train
of
thought
;
and
,
when
ever
he
has occasion
to
speak upon that
subject
,
he
flies
off
into some absurd
notion
or
other
,
and
no
argument what
ever
can
drive
him
from
his
purpose
.
In
delirium
,
the patient neither knowswhere
he
is
nor what
he
does
,
except
for
a
few
moments
,
when violently roused
.
In
somnambulism
,
there are certain volun
tary motions performed
,
without our
be
ing sensible
of
volition
.
In
reverie
,
the
mind
is
so
wholly intent
on
its
own par
ticular train
of
thoughts
,
that
the
patient
takes
no
notice whatever
of
any thing
around him
.
42 AN ESSAY
But in such cases as I have detailed ,
there is no point on which
the
patients
can
be
said
to
be
irrational
;
they merely
state that they perceive objects
,
where
we
know
,
and where they
can
very easily
convince themselves
, that they
do
not
exist
:
-
-
their thoughts
Are combinations
of
disjointed things
;
And forms impalpable and unperceived

are
to
them
,
When this circumstance occurs
in

time
,
and more frequent opportuni
ties
for
examination
are
afforded
,
they
do
convince themselves
of
their non
-
exist
ence
,
and
,
when
,
as
I
have said before
,
their own reason
is
assisted
by
the
more
cultivated and unimpaired understanding
of
those around them
,
when there
is
no

whole is clearly made to appear a mere
delusion , a deceptio visus, arising from a
temporary disordered state of
the
animal
functions
,
wholly independent
of
the
persons
or
bodies those figures represent
.
But what must have been the case
in
other circumstances
?
Suppose these phan
toms had only appeared
in
the night
?
-
-
suppose the physician had affected
all
the
arts and tricks
of
the designing magician
,
or
the crafty priest
-
-
how would
it
have
been then
?
Why
,
precisely what
we
have before asserted
:
they would have
gone through life with
a
belief
in
the
actual
re
-
appearance
of
the dead
,
as
well
as
the capability
of
communicating with
the spirits
of
their departed friends
;
and
thus they might have contributed their
evidence
to
the vile impositions
of
those
who have made
a
gain
of
the credulity
of
44 AN ESSAY
mankind , and who have; from interested
motives , encouraged the fear of ghosts ,
the worship of demons, the belief of
supernatural agency , which they could
controul by their spells ; of those who,
like Owen Glendower , can call spirits
from
the
vasty deep
,
or
of
the mystic
masons
,
who pretend
to
show
you
the
spirits
of
long departed friends
. Here
too
we
see
how
a
Mahomet

,
a
Jacob Behmen
*
,
may have not
*
Behmen
,
or
Boehm
,
Jacob
,
a
shoemaker
,
engaged
in
theological controversies
,
was perplexed
concerning many articles
of
faith
,
and prayed
for
divine illumination
.
In
this state
of
mind
he
fell
into
a
trance
or
ecstasy
,
which lasted him seven
days
,
and afforded
him
an
intuitive vision
of
God
.
.
Soon after
he
had
a
second ecstasy
,
was surrounded
with celestial irradiation
,
his spirit carried
to
the
most inward world
of
nature
,
and enabled
to

,
lineaments
,
and
colours
of
bodies
,
into the recess
of
their assembly

a
third vision

only imposed on
the
world
,
but also
on
themselves
,
the whole farrago
of
their
celestial communications
,
and converse
with superior beings
; and
it
seems
to
me
probable
,
that certain professors
of
this
art may have the power
of
throwing
themselves into that state
,
in
which they
can bring before them those imaginary
unsubstantial beings
.
This
is
no
new
opinion
.
If
I
remember right
,
it
has
been related
of
the
Pythian priestess
,
and appears
to
me
to
be
the case with
the wizards
of
Kamschatka

for
a

of
antimony

,

,
when burnt
in
a

,
would so affect
the
person
shut
up
in

that
he
would fancy
he
saw spectres and apparitions
; and that
,
by
throwing
his
voice into
a
particular
part
of
the room
,
he
could make
the
person believe
he
was holding converse
with spirits

LOCKE ; HIS OPINIONS. SHAKSPEARE - MAC
BETH HAMLET . CONCLUSION .
The common argument , by which the
belief in spirits has been combated ,
viz
.
«
that only one man
at
a
time ever
saw
a
ghost
;
and
,
therefore
,
the probability
is
,
that there never was such
a
thing
,
"
though
true
,
has never perhaps produced con
viction
,
nor had the effect
of
removing
the fears
or
of
shaking the belief
of
those
who have only been transiently affected
with
the
disease
,
-
because
the
mere
de
nying
of
a
fact
,
supported
by
supposed
positive evidence
,
cannot produce con
48 AN ESSAY
PV
viction . But even
this
argument
has
been controverted
;
and
a
case has been
published
by
Mr
.
Cumberland
,
from
a
paper
or
a
memorandum
,
found accident
ally
in
manuscript
,one hundred years
old
,
in
which
it
is
asserted
,
that some men
,
who lay
in
bed
,
frightened out
of
their
wits
,
allowed they saw what the distem
pered brain
of
the disordered person
saw
.
I
am
sorry that
a
story
on
such bad evi
dence should have found credit for a
moment
,
with
so
respectable
a
writer
as
the author
of
the Observer
,
for
the
ge
neral opinion
of
all
ages
is
against
it
;
and
the
evidence
on
which this case
is
related
,
ought never
to
have had any
weight
.
It
has been said
by
Mr
.
Locke
,
that
the
ideas we form
of
goblins and sprights have

with light. This is certainly very just,
as we have clearly seen by the foregoing
relations , where the spectres appeared
by day as well as by night ; and yet we
know they are more generally connected .
This I take to be owing, not merely, as
Mr. Locke says , to the association of
ideas, but to the circumstance that, dur
ing
the
night
,
many sources
of
inform
ation are cut off
,
by
which the true
nature
of
these appearances might
be
ascertained
;
besides
,
I
have reason
to
believe
,
that slight degrees
of
the com
plaint more frequently occur
in
the
night
than
in
the day
,
and that these slight and
transient attacks are those which have
been most commonly handed down
to
us
.
From what
I
have related
,
it
will
be
seen
,
if
my theory
be
true
,
why
it
should
happen

that only one

and here
we
may
lament
,
that our celebrated dramatist
,
whose knowledge
of

is
every
Englishman

boast
,
had not known such
cases
as
those
I
have related
,
and their
causes
;
he
would not then
,
perhaps
,
have made
his
ghosts visible and audible
on
the
stage
.

Every expression
,
every
look
in
Macbeth and Hamlet
,
is
perfectly
natural and consistent with men
so
agi
tated
,
and quite sufficient
to
convince us
of
what they see
,
hear
,
and suffer
;
but
it
must
be
evident
,
that the affection being
confined solely
to
the individual
,
such
objects must
be
seen and heard
by
the
individual only

That men circumstanced as Macbeth
or Hamlet, Brutus *,or Dion were , should
see
phantoms
,
and hold converse with
them
,
appears
to
me perfectly natural
;
and
,
though the cases
Ihave now related
owe their origin entirely to
a
disordered
state
of
bodily organs
,
as
may
be
evi
dently inferred from the history of their
rise
,
and the result
of
their cure
,
yet
,
with
the
knowledge
we
have
of
the
effects
of
mind
on
the
body
,
we
may
fairly conclude
,
that great mental anxiety
,
*
The whole story
of
Brutus and
his
evil genius
rests upon Plutarch
.
That the phantom said
,
he
would meet
him
at
Philippi
,
may
,
or
may not
be
true
:
that Brutus
saw
an
apparition previously
to
the battle
of
Philippi
,
I
believe
,
because
I
have
known others
,
who have seen the same kind
of
phantom
;
but that the phantom told
him
he
would
meet
him
again
at
Philippi
,
and that
he
did
there
meet
him
,
I
do
not believe
.
Plutarch only says
,
it
was reported
he
did
meet him there
.

inordinate ambition , and guilt, may pro
duce similar effects ; nay , I am con
vinced , that if it were allowable for the
physician to dive into the mental uneasi
ness of his patient , many similar facts
might be added . I think , that I have
known some who dared not to tell
all
they had seen and felt
.
I
, some time
ago
,
saw
a
man labouring under what
he
called
a
nervous complaint
;
I
made
him
shrink
,
when
I
told
him
I
knew
he
ima
gined
he
saw people
in
his room whom
he
did not wish
to
see
,
and others whom
he
knew
to
be
dead
;
he
rather unwil
lingly confessed
it
,
when his wife had
withdrawn
.
I
have thus endeavoured
to
draw the
public attention
to
a
subject not yet suf
ficiently investigated
by
the
learned
;
and
the cases which
I
have adduced
,
will
,
I
ON APPARITIONS . 53
trust, have some effect in elucidating
the
operations
of
the human mind
in
a
state
of
disease
,
and
in explaining
by
natural
causes
,
what has hitherto
,
when believed
,
been attributed
to
supernatural agency
.
