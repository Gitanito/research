PREFACE.
The doctrine, my countrymenJ That is it, give us the doctrine first ..
Every foo.1 can argue for or against it.. 1.fuat we want to know is, what
is the good of it.? What is: it all about?
Has: not Huxley said of' Spiritualism and its manifestations, that,
'~Supposing the phenomena. to be: genuine:,. they do not interest me? If any
body ~uld endow me with the f'acul.ty of listening to the chatter of old
women and curates at the nearest cathedral town, I should decline the
p·rivilege, having better things to do.. And if the folk in the spiritual.
world do not talk more wisely and sensibly than their friends report. them
to do~ I put thera in the same category.. "
And do not our friends say, "Well, if Spiritualism is true, what of it?"
Now, I do not argue for or against this matter. 19.My mind is not made up for
that. 19 I have only investigated it for seventeen years. It is true I have
seen hundreds of mediums, and had perhaps a thousand communications, and
I have had the slate-writing and the pencil-writing on paper, both indepen-
dent of fraud or personal contact. I have also seen the so-called materializa-
tions, and I have witnessed the healing of the sick by the laying on of hands,
and I have heard the uneducated speak intelligently in languages unknown to
themselves.. Still, "I haven't made up myr mind" that these things are done
by the spirits of persons who once lived in this world.. In the material-
iz.ation, I have seen what looked like living,. bona fide human beings, both
at Moravia and at Eddy's.. They came without fraud.. "That much I 111 stick
to as long as I live... " They went away like the light of a candle when it
ia extinguished, and there was no more of' them after the s 9eances than is
to be seen of the comet this day. But still my mind is not made up that
these things are explained by spiritism.
I have talked with these real, solid phantoms (at the S1eances), and
recorded the conversations on a great many of the occasions. That is
what this pamphlet is made out of. Seventeen years ago, I got part of
this from some invisible being (it seemed like a being) that kept floating
above the head of the medium, and spoke audibly through a trumpeto It
was not ventriloquism nor fraud. It was a voice not like any thing of
earth.. But the subject was unfinished. For fourteen years,. I obtained
nothing more on the same subject; and then I did. This was written by
some unaccountable means, on the uqder side of a slate while it lay on
the top of a table in broad daylight, and we looking at the slate, hear-
ing the writing being done. This, too, was unfinished and disconnected.
Now,. three years later, and in the presence of other mediums, the sub-
ject was resumed, and is apparently finished so as to go with the other
two lots. The last I had viva voce from one of the so-called spirits.
He stood face to face with me, in a public assembly, and had all the
general appearance of a gentleman. About twenty other people were
present and w1 tnessed it, and from the fact that they all wanted 18to put
in a little talk" once and awhile, I have no doubt whatever about the
genuineness. of the phantom or of the voice being from the same source.
I know it was not a fraud, and I had the means of knowing. But, if you
PREFACE.
will understand me, I will say there are two conclusions which have been
arrived at in regard to this so-called spiritism, by those who have seen
and ascertained beyond a doubt that the phenomena do occuro One conclus-
ion is, that they are caused by the spirits of persons who once lived on
earth as we not live.. These believers seldom try first to prove that.
there is such a thing as a spirit.. They assume, first, there is such a
thing in man, and that it survives the death or the body, and then they
quote the phenomena in order to prove their assumption. The other con-
clusion is, that though the phenomena do occur, they are but the result
o.t a living magnetism or electricity belonging to the living body ot the
mediWlt. These assume, therefore, first, that there is such a magnetic
power in mediums, and they then try to prove their assumption by quoting
the phenomena.
I do not affiliate, in this pamphlet, with either of these, but only
"show up" the doe:trine taught by these apparently intelligent occurrences.
In this pamphlet, the questions are mine; the answers are fran the so-
c-alled spiritso It is, in fact,, a general summing up of the spiritual
d'o~trine that has been brought about by my own investigations... Therefore,
it is no expression of any other spirit doctrineo For be it understood,
by those unacquainted with the subject, all the so-called spirits have a
right to return to earth and preach whatever they pleaseo And spirit.a
do differ so much! But are they really spirits, or are they a principle
belonging to certain persons called mediums? No matter;:: I.et those prove
it who canr we want the doctrine..

SPIRI'rALIS.
Can we reflect and acquire new ideas while our physical bodies remain
motionle s a?
You can. Thought and reflection are the exercisie of spiritual bodies•
They may be either separate or in connection with the physical organiza-
tion. The nervous system is the machine on which the spirit works to-
govern and control. the whole body.
What are spiritual bodies?
'lhey are a subtle, ethereal substance, somewhat resembling electricity
and magnetism, but having the capacity of individuality.
Whence their origin?
Originally from God1 the source or· life and thought.. Bat. they are also
generated into new individualities by the union of physical bodies~ male
and female ..
Row are these new individual spirits germinated?·
Such is a law of God, that the seed of physical bodies coming together,
under certain conditions,. causes a new life to spring into being.. You
have seen that an acid and alkaline solution put together in one vessel
c:auses a violent exercise and neutralization of the two chemicals. This
is decomposition, or death. The opposite of this, orlifeg is the ge:md.n-
ation of spirit in the union of the sexes. In the egK, these two proper-
ties may remain dormant for a considerable period of time, but by the appli-
cation of heat they change into a quickened spirit. with a new physical body.
'fhe body i.s borrowed from other substances, bu.t the spirit is a new in-
dividuality. In many mammals, the germination of spirit is direct, and
begins with the beginning of the physical body.
Where is the abode of spirits?
Any p:tac.e.. They inhabit gross, matter at first; but they also float in
t.he air, and even into th~ highest ethereal space~
Are spirits perfect when first germinated?
They are not. N'athing is perfect save God, who is the centre and cir-
cumif"erence of all things~ Spirits grow with the gross bodies where they -
are ger.ninated; but afterward,. when the gross material loses its powers
or absorption, which is physical death, the spirit leaves it~
Is it then perfect?
No,. but if it has profited in knowledge and purity, it will have some
strength to ascend into a larger and more exalted field of action..
/.

SPIRITALIS.
Hbw is it possible tor a spiritual body to exist after the destruction
or the material or gross body where it germinated, and outi. of which it
had its o rigiri?
EVen as the friction or two bodies will produce electricity, or as .
magnetism can be impregnated with steel without the destruction of the
original body, so is the spirit produced.. The spirit has not its origin
at the expense of the physical body, but is the result of the union ot
principles.. Life and death are op:posites. An acid and alkali will
combine to die; but the seed or living bodies combines to live... k ~om­
bination or dead substances produces death:: a combination from the living
produces life.. The nearer perfect the physical bodies are, so IID.lch great-
er is the strength of the spiritual body produced.. Nevertheless, the
spirit once germinated has an independent existence, and is nurtured on
the electrical or spirit principle in nature, even as the physical body
is nurtured on earthly bodies.. The refore the destruction 0-f the physical
body does not destroy the spirit"
Do.es the spirit require spiritual food, even as the gross body requires
gross food?-
It doeso While the spirit inhabits the gross body, it can absorb from
the same food that which it requires; but when it has left the body, it _
absorbs spiritual food from other things a By spiritual food, it must not
be understood: that which dies, but that whi.ch lives" Nbt that the spirit
is a cannibal,. and fe·eds on other spirits, .for that would be death, and
contrary t.o its capacity, but it absorbs from elementary substances that
which is electrical or living principle, which is its subtenance.. The
physical body can live only on the bod'i.es of' things dead, but which once
did live, and hence it too must die... But the spiritual body derives its
sustenance from the opposite of these things, and so becomes life eternalo
What proof' have we that there is a spiritual 'or electrical bcdy within us?
Life, thought,. and loc:omotiono That which is: dead moves not,. nor has
it any self-controlling pow$r..
That is proof' of some quickening principle within us; but how shall we know
that it is a weritable body?
Not. a pin's point can penetrate your flesh without the spirit's knowl-
edge- thereof.. Hence the spirit extends to every part of the physical body
and has its fOrtn and COnfigurat.iOne> When the pin IS point has given YOU:
pain, wh ic.h is the interr~i;:tioa or your electrical or spiritual action in
the physical body, your whole consciousness is aroused; but when your
spiritual or electrical power has c:eased, which is physical death, no
consciousness exists in the body... Also,. amongst you there are some who
have lost an arm or a leg, anC. are yet cm scious of the spiritual pres-
ence Of the member losto It matters not,. so it be understood by you: what
the spirit is,. v.tlether you d:o interpret. it to yotir own liking to be a

SPilUTALIS..
Have all living bodies a spirit?
They have. The~ spirit is life;· its extent and capacity are no secret
to whoever may choose to leam of God 1 s works... The ant that builds a
house in the sands or the desert is a chil.d or God. But human beings
possess a wide· range or thought and reflection; they have dominion over
all other living being on earth. In this, we caution you that you \
~rrogate to 7ourselves no vainglorT, but rather seek to know the glory
and wisdom of Hint who rash ioned the whole world, that you may ever bear
in mind the very humble position you are in.. For until you have passed
through many births and many deaths, you can not fathom the grandeur and
perfection or the universe~
What, shall the spirit die also?
In language familiar to those in the fiesh, yes.; but, speaking from the
ethereal throne, no; the spirit never dies. And yet in the spirit world,
there are countless millions endeavoring to comprehend the life that is to
come after, even as you now seek to penetrate beyond the burial of your
mortal bodies ..
OF THE SPIRIT WHILE IN THE BODY.
Hla:s the s:pirit any capacity, while it inhabits the gross body, to do or
act beyond it?
In some organizations it has.. It can impart its own knowledge to another
off like capacity at considerable distances.
By. what means?
It. is. itself an electrical substance, harmonious with inanimate electricity,
the elements or which extend through all atmospheres. Where one spirit is
en rapport with another, a current or thought passes from· one person to
another..*
The most sensitive organ, however, for receiving or dispersing spiritual
electricity is the eye.. One who is a.sleep can be awakened by another- gazing
on the eyelidso- Such is nonnal spirit force... But there is an abnormal
spirit capacity in which the person can permit the spirit to extend out of
and beyond the gross body, to see and to know things at a distance. This
is called clairvoyanc·eo ·
* When I was a young lad, going home from a singing-school
one night, I tell from a high bridge, and was knocked
senseless.. At that moment, or thereabout, my mother,
resident two and a half miles distant, heard me say,
''Mother, my head hurts so!"' So rigidly did she guard
against· the name or superstition, that she concealed this
tact, for several years. I have heard of many such in-
.stances, but this is the only one I can verify myself,
save such as will be hereafter related under another
head..
SPIRITALISo
Fl'O"R can the spirit travel out of the gross body, and the body not die?
The spiritual body can unite with inanimate eleatricity and travel
thereon, somewhat as your physical body travels on the' earth... But while
it is yet gone temporarily from the physical body, it keep~up a connect-
ion therewith, and generally returns to it before death ensues, but not
always;.,_-1(-
Then there are cases in which the physical body is asleep, during which
the spirit has power to see and know thinms intelligibleG You have those
amongst you who ha.ve slept soundly even while they toiled on,-i:* which1
should be evidence to you that there is a spiritual body within you,
capable of manifesting intelligence while the gross matter is unconscious$
Furthermore, you all do know that you draarn while you are physically-
asleepo You have therefore within you that which can think even while
your bodies lie dormant and helpless ...
i*" Judge Edmonds, by,· having a circle at Boston and another in
New York sit at the same hour, demonstrated the fact that
mental questions and answers could be carried on success-
fully at that great distance by the force above referred toc>-
It will be seen, however, that this is not strong testimony
of a life beyond the grave, since it appears to have been
accomplished wholly by that which belongs to living physical
bodieso
~* In crossing the plains in 1849, I often saw the over-exhausted
teamsters driving over difficult and dangerous roads while
sound asleep~ On coming to a hill, they would put on the brakes
and lock the wagon exactly as if awake, and then unlock it again
at the bottom of the hill. On being aroused, the poor fellows
would become frightened in recollecting the dangerous places
they had passed in safetyo
What distinction is there between the mere action of the brain and nervous
system and that of· the spirit?
Even as· the battery is the place where inanimate= electricity is gener-
ated, s0 is the physical body the abode of the spirit for the time beingo
The· brain and nervous system a.lone have no inherent power save by the spirit,
which has power even to destroy the whole bodyo
You have also those amongst you whose spirit C'.an go out of the body and
read seal.ed papers; and yet others who c·an acquire a knowledge of things,
though alll their external s·.enses be blindfoldedo
The action of the brain and nervous system is contained within the
gross body, nor c·an inert matter, as a sealed letter, act upon them..
Row are thoughts read by the spirit?
The spirit extends in its normal condition to the surface or the body,

and when one of the parties is positive and the other passive,. the
circuit is established so that the spirit or thought predominant be-
comes as one.~<
* I have been recently experimenting on this subJect
with a young man by the name of Brown, at my own
hous.e. Any one of us might hide a knife or other
article, and ne could, even though blindfolded, by
holding such person's hand a moment, become so mag-
netized, he would walk straight off to the pla:ce it
was concealed. Also, we might place our m
1
ind on any
particular friend's name, and he would spell it out
correctly. But if we had ourselves forgotten the
word, or the place the article was hidden, then the
young man would fail. Mr. c. Foster's clairvoyance
is of a different character.. We could hand him any
number of written names, folded so he could not see
them, and yet his answers always proved to be re-
sponsive to each and every name. If, for example, I
asked on the slip of paper, "lr.s the spirit of my
cousin, Hattie Jones$ present?tt he would answer for
my cousin, Hattie Jones, even though I had forgotten
what was on the paper, and perhaps even though there
never was any such a cousin. This rather goes to
prove that he has a. faculty or power to go outside of
himself to learn what is written in the sealed paper,
but that the answer comes from his own intelligence~
Can not magnetism extend beyond a given body, and produce motion in another?
It can; but the capacity to acquire o·r impart knowledge is more than dead
magnetism.. The· thunder can cleave the mighty oak, but it does not receive
or impart intell'igence.. Such magnetism or electricity is a power that
springs from inanimate bodies, and it grows not. But the power that springs
.from· the living body is spirit, and it can receiv:·e and impart knowledgea
OF THE SPIRIT AFTER IT HAS LEFT THE PHYSICAL BODY.
Hbw can it be proven that the spirit lives after the death of the physical
bod7?
Rather, how will you receive proof: For, except you have a spirit to
receive proof r·rom the spirit of others, you can not be convinced.. A feather
can not go against the wind; neither can the spirit out of the body come unto
him who will not receive ito There are many amongst you mo do, daily, re-
ceive knowledge from spirits out or the body, and yet arrogate to themselves
all the credit. Others are to skeptical and so spitefully opposed to spirit
power, that they are deserted by even their own spirit friends.. For such as
these, we say to you, there is no proof of a spiritual body after death..
SPIRITALIS.-
If faith necessary, in the first place?
Faith is not necessary. B:ven as the child must go to school to learn,
so shall you come unto us; and as the child that will not go to school
learns not, s.o will you, except you seek spirit knowledge, remain in dark-
ness. And yet it is for these that we labor most;- and more do we rejoice
in the enlightenment of one such than in many who have faith. There are
some who, having buried the physical body of their friend, buried from
their own memory al so the spirit. 1rlhen this spirit returns to them in
their dreams and seeks remembrance, it has no welcome~ On the following
morn, this infidel to spirit power seeks an explanation by referring_ to
his stomach. This is the predominance of the gross body over spirit, and
so murderous is its effect on his own living spirit, that, when he goes out
of the body, his spirit lies dormant nigh unto death. Such an infidel
spirit can not return to any of you and give you proof o:t anythingo And
really amongst us in the spirit world, there are more of these than the
sands or· the sea..- We: need to teach them al so, for they are constantly
pleading for light and assistance. Let us put this question to you: How
can a man who speaks only English believe that two Lati.n scholars can un-
derstand each other? Verily, by becoming a Latin scholar himself, or by
resting on the faith of their assurance& So is it with you in regard to
the spirit. If you can rest on the faith of others, it is the spirit of
truth within you that enables you to do so~ but if you ignore the voice of
others, then must you seek to understand the spirit by means of your own
knowledge. To those who have faith, we would say, plead fondly for the
spirits of' those you love to come unto you, and they will come. Such
persons have the proof within their own hearts..- Though to those who be-
lieve nothing, but anchor all they receive on knnowledge alone, we have
tried many ways to make them understand. In cases of murder or other
sudden death, where the phosphorus and the inanimate magnetism went dO'Nlt
with the body, we have induced the spirit to return to the place, and take
upon himself the elements necessary for your mortal vision to behold him;
but you believed not in the spirit, but ra.ther in the phosphorus and mag-
netism:.. We have given you signs and wonders for ages and ages, but you
have ever ignored us.. We have moved ponderable substances be:t'ore your
vision; we have pounded on walls, and caused huge tables to tip answers to
your endless questions; and, after exhausting ourselves, we have flitted
silently amongst you, and heard you ignore us or call us the devil.. You
have denied that we manifested intelligence, but when we played on musical
instruments, you told us we were merely will-power~ We have written
thousands of messages to you, and we are laughed at for our silly productions~
If we bring a philosopher to your circles, you ask him such foolish questions
as, "How many chickens has our speckled hen?ll' "Is it right for me to feed
the old blind horse on bran or meal?'' "Tell me whether I trimmed m.v toe-
nails last Sun~ay rnorning?•t
Really, must we say to you, you are so grossly wrapped up in earthly
ideas-, that it is almost impossible for spirit power to manifest the things
most needed.. :Juery: When your friend visits a far-off countcy, and writes
to you, shall he not describe the things where he is? So also he who sees
colors may attempt to teach the blind what color means/, but the blind

and write distinctly on a: piece of paper, and also on slates; but our re-
ward has been, to be denounced as merely some kind of magnetisnu. t
t Professor Crookes, Robert Dale Owen, and many other
intelligent and honorable gentlemen, have witnessed
these things frequently. Also, there are upward ot
ten thousand people in New York alone (not ·known to
scientists) who have ·witi:iessed the writing, coming
as· statedabove, without any trick whatever..
Ir you are veri t'able beings,, can you not appear before the camera, and be

We have done that al so.. It was one of our -greatest rejoicings in the
spirit v.orld when we discovered this, for we could scarcely imagine how
our fellow-creatures who were yet in the flesh could find a flaw in our
reality any longer. But our first medium was persecuted for being a devil
and a fraud. This made us wary; but after his liberation,. we began on a
ni.ore scientit'ic basis. Now, we are rewarded by scientists saying, the
force of the will-power of some person present causes the emanations of
the body to take a human shape, and that there is no spirit about it.

can accomplish? v-

complimented as a clever trick, and inexplicableo We have manufactured

physical body and the clothes to hide its nakedness, when you yourselves

Even more, we have, thus materialized, come into your circles, talked
with you, danced with and rejoiced with you. We have thus sat down
gnongst you, and with your own scissors, cut pieces out of our dresses
and left them with you·, and you found the fabric not unlike ax1y other..
And while we thus sat with our dress cut full of holes, we have taken it

O~ all the things we have devised for convincing our fellow-creatures
in the flesh that the spirit can and does return, there is not one but the
infidel can find a way to disbelieve$ The people's hearts are steeped in
false religions; their desires are wholly of the earth; they are even in-
fidels to themselves and to their own pretensions. Hany of them affect to
believe in a God, and that they have a soul that lives after the death of
the body; and in their stiff-necked in.fidelity their hearts are so hard-
ened, that when the very evidence of their own pretensions is placed be-
fore them, they deny it... How can we prove ourselves to such as these?
And further than this, when such people are born into the spirit world,
they are premature births, and know not themselves who they are..** But
amongst you there are many who receive the spirit, and to those we are too
apt to bestow our love and benefi tso· Let us bear in mind, that when a: man
has two sons, one who is wayward, wicked, and deserts his father, and the
other remains with him and takes plea.sure in his counsel, the father seeks
to ·do the latter all the good he can. It is so of the spirit: to those
who love us, we are a comfort and a guide.. 'fo these we can prove ourselves
at all times and places, and by such simple devices as may occur in the
daily walks of lifeo· When these persons are born into the spirit world,
they are in the light, and can behold the course that leads on toward the
throne of God.. iHH<
i~ Mr,, Crookes, F.R.S., and many members of the circle, all attest
to this, and further state that the light within the room was
such that they could. not be mistaken.. I have myself witnessed
the making of material shawls by the so-called spirit merely
passing one hand over a vase of flowers; but the light was
too dim to be attested to by me. It looked so very like
the tricks of the prestidigitateurs, that I could not be-
lieve even what I saw. The being or spirit, if it was one,
was itself equally astounding, for it ca.me and also dis-
appeared I knew not whither, though I went and examined
the plac·e.
-!Hr That which we denominate death is called here the birth
into the spirit world.

ness of spirit testimony which was taken in all confidence

ity to believe these things on such easy terms. I have so

my skepticism might be wrong, owing to my much re-
search, I have taken children to witness spirit
phenomena, in order that I might have the benefit
of their unbiased judgmen~.- But strange to say,
all of these immedj_ ately became spiritualists in
fact, and tren I ignored their judgments, because
they were children, and too easily convinced. In
this respect, I have often pondered on a remark
said to have been made by Jesus in reference to
little children. He had most likely made the dis-
covery, too, that their unbiased minds and con-
fiding hearts made thern the best recipients of
spirit power..
OF THE MATERIAL AND SPIRIT WORLD
What distinction can you draw between. the spirit world and the material
WO rJld.?
For convenience of expression, solids which have the c:apacity of gravi-
tation you may call material bodies, and also for convenienee of express-
ion, you may call spirit all such rarefied material as has no gravitation
such as you understand ...
Then the spirit is also a material body'?
It i.s well that you so call it. Many years ago, the scientist taught
that there were but five primitive elements; now they are subdivided into
many.. The materialist teaches that there is but one body in man, but we
have shown you that there is also a. spirit body which separates out of the
gro·ss material. But when you ask us, 11 Ds the spirit body also a material
body?" we answer in the affirm?tive. Even as you have magnetism in iron,
so is the spirit in man. And even as the spirit of man is in him and can
go out of him, so are the elements out of which that spirit was made in the
spirit world. The material body is made out of the gross matter of earth;
the spirit has its originating source in the spirit world, but it is quick-
ened into an individuality in gross matter. The spirit world is the elemen-
tary corrlition of simples out of which the spirit springs into being, and
the home to which it returns after it has established its individuality in
an earthly form.. Somewhat as gas may be extracted from wood, when it will
float off to a kindred refinement, so does the spirit, on its liberation from
the gross body, float into the spirit world. Yet this comparison is defec-
tive from our standpoint in the spirit world, for spirit is not like a gas,
but a quickening element. Nor can we teach you what spirit really is, nor
of the spirit world, for you have not that perception within you while in
the flesh which will enable you to understand. As we stated before, you can
not teach a blind man to understand colors, though you may teach him elemen-
tar,y principles by comparison to the things he can feel; even so do we labor
to a disadvantage in trying to tea.eh you of the nature and capacity of the
spirit world. When you speak of the intellectual world, you allude to the
• l
SPIRITALISo
wisdom....of man; but when we speak of the intellectual. world,. we' allude to
.that ~ove you, from which you draw your intelligenceo When you speak
of' carbon,. you allude to coal or the diamond; but when we speak of carbon,
we allude to that element beyond your research, and out of which your
gro,ss material is madeo Your wisdom partakes of a knowledge of the things
earthly, but ours deals with the elements from which earthly thing& are
madeo· Our field of research is more extensive, for we must acquire a
knowledge of earthly things before we can proceed far with the elements
in the spirit worldo And yet beyond us there is a still higher sublima-
ted existence beyond our present capacity to comprehend... This much we are
made to understand, and we impart it to you also - that ia,. the more knowl-
edge you acquire on earth pertaining to Go~'s laws, the easier will be your
progress in the sp:l.rit mrld... ·
' ON' THE CONDITION OF SPIRITS IN THE SPIRIT WORLD ..
VJhat is the general condition and occupation of spi:rits in the spirit \'lOrld?-
In1 condition, the spirits are somewhat. similar to .what they were on earth:
some are poor and wretched; others happy and prosperous.. The poor are the
blind ones, and the wretched ones are those who lived in s:in and iniquity on
earth... The good and-intelligent spirits are prosperous ~d happy... The occu-
pation here is,., broadly, as it was on earth- namely:, struggling to better
their condition...
'What! can spirits be blind?
Even so"' Some of them are blind by disease, but many of them ~xtinguished
their·own sighto But lest you do not understand, we caution you that you
weigh this matter from a spiritual standpoint~ You who can not see and reel
the influence of spirit power are weak or diseased in spiritual sight~ But
those who could see and feel our presence, bllt would not, do bring blindness
on themselveso- The birth or such spirits into the spirit world gives us
great labor and sorrow. With them, we: find it necessary to begin with the sim-
plest forces, and to gradually inerease their lessons till they begin to have
a spiritual vision~ In this, we find that the spiritual knowledge they might
have gained on earth in a lifetime requires here hundreds of years, reckoning
our time by yours o-
What of the wretched ones who sinned all their lives on earth?
or these, we address you with rear and trembling; for the things which you
call sin are not all sin, and the things which you call; righteousness are often
sin and wickedhess:.. Therefore, when we say that all men, women, and children
must answer for the deeds done in the body, be not hasty to conclude the mean-
ing o)f that which we vd. sh you to knowo Know then there are men who are plated-
ware, and some who are genuine metal.. The outside life and character of men
are all that you of earth can see and understand; but ea.eh and every one of
you has an inside life and character known to yourself and to the spirits
around you.. When you leave your earthly bodies, your gilded or earthly char-
acter is stripped off, and we all behold you and know just what you are,. for
SPIRITAJ.IS 12.
your inside life is your real spirit... On this spi.rit. are st.amped all
the good and evil deeds ever done in the body, and the name of this print
is oalled conscience. While on e 8.rth, the wicked man can. divert and hold
his conscience in abeyance by seeking amusement or ·recreation, but when he
is born into spirit 1:1.fe h.is victi:ns ;;.re a stain on his gament that he can
not hide ev·en from his owr, vision.
Can you give an illustration?
Suppose a 1 awyer defrauds a widow and brings misery and wretchedness on
her and her children: when he is born into spirit life, his fiz.:st aoquaint-
ance is the suffering face of the widow and children. Not tha.t they are
there in propria personce, but the imprint of their gdefs. For a long
while, he will endeavor to fight off the vision and to dissuade himself from
his suffering, but he can do nothing, study nothing, nor enjoy any spirit
society save such other miserable fellows as himself.. In due tim~, he takes
to prayer;- he asks God to re:nove the haunting vision, and to give him peace
and oompanior.s. His calle will bring to him other spirits, who, seeing his
sin and distress, enga.ge to help him ~nward and upward.. They will say to
him, "By wronging the widow and children, your spirit has become bound in
servitude to them ~nd theirs. Go now and do service unto them and to those
that love th:lm, until you have recompensed for the .sin committed. So much
shall your service be to those you have injured that you can say to them,
"Tell me, in God's name, what more I can do that I may win your love and be
cherished as your brother?" Then shall the widow: and the children sey, 'We
are more than paid: come into our hou~e, and be a:s one of us."' Such shall
be the end of his punishment, and the purity of his spirit shall be beholden
by those above him, and he shall be welcomed amongst them. But if' he commit-
ted other crimes: against other persons, then shall he so pay unto each and
all of them accordingly be.fore he shall have peace. Now, ewen a:i it is thus
told to you of one man, so ii!! it of all men. The thief and the murderer
must also work out their own salvation in like manner. But there are other
sins which we would call to your mind. First, the mother who has destroyed
her offspring b ef'o re i.t Wl'iS born. In her sin, she said to herself', "1 will
not have the cares of motherhood, for I will enjoy the pleasures of afflu-
ence and fashion." Now, to her we would have you say, that when she is born
into spirit life, her first acquaintances will be her own murdered offspring.
The motherhood she did avoid on earth must how begin; and even as much as
she robbed them of their material growth, so now shall she impart to them
from her own spirit. Her sin, in destroying the physical body, shall cause
her to labor herhaps a hundred years in order to pacify her burdened spirit..
So also shall it be with those who a.re accomplices with her in the same sin..
But all such sins as these can be recompensed and pardoned in due time-o
Though the sin against the lfoly Gh·:n~t. .can not be .f'orgiil'en; for it is; the
sin against. one's own spirit, and one can not forgive him.self... This is the
sin of imparting with one's own spirit.by physical gratification, \\hich tends
to destruction. We would give you this illustration: A boy climbed to the
top of a high monument, carrying with him a basket or eggs. When on the top,
he would,. for the pleasure o.f seeing an egg burst., let one egg drop over
the banisters. In a little while, he would let drop another egg, and then
another, and so on till his eggs were nearly all· gone. Then he beheld, alasl
that no amount of prayer or .forgi 11eness could ever restore the loss. Thus
·'
J
.,.

it is of those who sin against their own spirit b.V doi.."g t.hat which
detracts from it.s very self. When such persons are born into spirit
lif(;:, they bear with them the veakness: of their indulgence.. All eyes in
the spirit world are upon them.
Can you convey to our minds what length of time is required in spirit
life to pay off or balance the sins done in the material body'?
He who repents and seeks forgiveness from his victim:s with all his
heart and strength, may do it in a few years, or a few centuries at rnost;
but he who is perverse, and will not acknowledge the wisdom and glory of
GOd by obeying these laws, shall remain in -torment perhaps a million of
years. Yet we would have you ever bear in mind that our time is not as
your time, though we show you the principle by which obedience to God's
laws must be given•
.Amongst the different religions we have on earth, there are some that teach
us to call on the n·Mte of certain personages claiming to be prophets o-r
christs, and ask forgiveness for our sins, and it shall be done: now, what
shall we· believe? .
Doctrines are taught by our own fallible children. · You yourselves may
teach some doctrine, but will it carry the evidence of truth and justice·
in it? N'ow, would we ask you, who should restore to _the ·widow And children
an- equivalent fo.r the things of which she .has been wronged? Shall .the thief
. e~cape:by :askirtg,;·tbe prophet. or the Cbrist·.to,:e·~C~~~~:him'~:''.13.hd'·l'lojt"'eiri11:hi:di~;;_. ·· ·
rnent come to the widow and children? To all such as have the spirit of truth
and justice within themselves, they can perceiv,e that which to believe; but
you shall use arguments to those who do not understand, that they be not led
astray with false doctrines.
Of the blindness of which you said spirits suffered in the spirit world, can
you give us a comparative illustration of what we should understand?
Spirit blindness may be likened to ·a. dtunken man, who -s~es, but. can not go;
but th'e spirit is quickened, so it can go, but it sees not.. It is a night-
mare to the understanding. Have you not the insane amorigst you who believe
that they see hideous creatures in the air?· who are delirious with their own
imaginings'! So, not so is it with the blind in spirit life• They believe the
things they do see are a delusion;. they believe they ·themselves are a delusion;
they believe not that they are out of their earth bodies; and ·they are ever
pleading to their fellow-spirits to help them remove these delusions so they
~an live as before, believing they are still on earth, but haunted by the
things they see.. ·
'What is the cause of tl')is blindness?
Mainly stubbornness and false religions in the earth-life. Instead of
becoming in spirit like little children whil.e they were on earth, they set
up stubborn doctrines, making a god and a heaven to suit their own various
conceptions. Their vanity and belief became a part of their spirit, and
when they came ·into the· spirit world, they found not that which they' had:
SPIRITALIS. 14·
imagined, and so do believe they are only in a diseased condition still in
the body. There are many of these who were upright people on earth and
fierce advocates of their own religion.
How can people know what is the true religion in order to avoid this ·blind-
ness?
All people have the spirit within them i\hich, if not wrongly taught, can
lead the way to light and knowledge. We have a short catechism that we val-
ue highly in the spirit world, and we will give it you: How shall we instruct
our children in the true religion? The answer is: Teach them charity and
justice to one another, and to rest in confidence on Hint who created the
universe..
You have said the occupations of the spirits are similar to what we have on
earth: how can that be?
Similar, but spiritual. Every one works for himself.. On earth, you seek
for earthly treasures; in the spirit world, we seek for spiritual treasures..
On earth, you seek your desires, even at the expense of your brethren,. and
you take fraudulently from one another. In the spirit world, we do not this,
for we take only from original elements, and make the things we require.. To
do this, our knowledge must be cultivated; and therefore the more knowledge
we obtained on earth in reference to the laws of solids and compounds, of
which we were once a part, the easier can we proceed in this life.
Can you, give an idea of the experience of a truly good man on entering the
spirit world?
Even as· a child is born on earth, with friends around it to rejoice at
its coming, so do kind and loving spirit friends welcome into the spirit
v.orld a truly good man's spirit •. The incorruptible leaves the corruptible
in the twinkling of an eye; but before his spirit has thus departed, and
while the dissolution is about to take place, the spirit friends enter in-
to communion with him, and magnetize the body, which gives him liberty to
go out~ As soon as he has departed, his friends also withdraw from the body,
and bearhim hence .. For a.long while, it is like a pleasant dream, and he
begins to reflect within himself as to the cause of his not waking up. He
looks around him nowr and beholds many of his friends whom he remembers to
have been long since deado As: fast as he remembers them, they come to him
and greet him: kindly, lovingly.. Then com·e his loving wife and daughter;
then perhaps a little son that he once almost idolized. Next come his aged
father and mother. The 1atterj being near akin and more in his confidence
than any other, converses with him awhile, as if she would not too suddenly
apprise him of his birth .. At last, she assures him how she has longed for
him to come home to heaven;- how she has watched and prayed for many long
years to have her children once more near he:r.. Them she asks him if he can
collect his thoughts ~ow so aa to realize that ne is really in heaven. At
f'irst, he may doubt, but she tells him to look about him, and see that he
ha.s indeed left his: friends and. the earth behind.. A great sorrow begins to
cloud his vision, for he remembers the loved ones still behind; but his:
mother bid·s him to remember God 1s laws, and to conform his desires therewith..
·'
SPIRITALIS. 15.
His heart is almost bursting with love, for he has loved ones in both the
worlds. His friends perceive that his emotion is too great, and with a kind
salutation, he is magnetized into another sweet slumber until he gains more
strength. By and by, he awakes again, and so again do the spirit friends
attend him and teach ,him to realize his new .birth. But when the trials· are
too severe,, he is again put into a sweet slumber for awhile, and then again
awakes for more enlightenment. But, like a child of earth, he soon desires
to run alone. But he can not. His instructors bring forth music, by which he
concentrates thought, and now he discovers how to move from place to place..,
Like a youth of earth, his first desire is to travel.. He would see all the
spirit world at once. But even as a youth of earth will soon find impenetrable
f'orests, s:o will he filmd impenetrable space too rarefied for his procedure..
As: a youth or earth discovers that he needs a compass to find the way, and
a:ites: to hew out a path, so does our spirit friend need science and various
electric forces to enable him to. enter into the· worlds. peopled by spirits
millions and millions of years ago.. Then does he really, for the first time
in his life, begin to adore the glory and wisdom of God. He is almost over-
come with emotion. He would fly back to earth, and tell his loved ones of
the glories he has seen. Ire does so; he comes to them in the night-time;,
he watches them in their sleep when the g·Foss body interferes not, and then
he· tells his story. He smiles on them, and they rejoice with him;- and when
they awake, they thank God for the sweetness of their dreams, for they rea-
lize that a lov.ed one did visit them, and that the spirit lives after the
body is dead. But thi.a spirit knows no r~st, for he would carry the joys
unt.o all people.. He would whisper the love of God into all ears.. So he
looks about,, and, lo· and beholdl he ventures into an audience amongst. you
earthly investigators of spirits; and the first question you ask hinr is some
such silly question as the price of salt pork in South-America! He is
shockedo His concentration of thought is broken, and he vanishes back to
his spirit home .. ·Here he contemplates on the real work before him, endeavor-
ing to devise a method to convert the whole world to spirit truths.. He thinks
it is easy•. Again he visits you in strange circles; but is again and again
shocked and rebuffed by your infidelity to spirit Iaw.. He finds that his
labors are too much for him, and that he must look to his own enlightenment
in order to keep pace with his spirit companions. Then he quits the earth
perhaps for ever, or perhaps returning only to those: who are dear and sweet
to him. And when they too Join hi1111 in spirit 1 ife, he looks scarcely ever
more to earth, but looks onward, upward to the changes that lie before him..
OF WORSHIP IN DIFFERENT FORMS.
What is the true mode of worship?
To ever call on God, and to deal with justice and charity to all his
living creatures:..
Is it a sin to V10 rship the sun?
That harms no man, but it is a great folly. There are many who worship
the sun, believing it is God. These do worship truly the Spirit, though in
ignorance of what spirit it, choose that which seems to them the most power-
f\ll.. This is no sin, but fblly..
SPIRITALIS.
Is it a sin to worship Jesus and the prophets?
To those who believe these are God, no; and yet their worship is also
a great folly. The spirits endeavor to enlighten all men so as to make
them honest and charitable to one another9 This we have found, many men
have a symbol to remind them of God~ Some use the sun as a symbol; some
have an animal, as a white bull; some have legendary tales and history,
and yet others have their prophet or their Christ. Now, do we say to you,
that inasmuch as any of these awakens in man the knowledge or spirit power
and an inclination to charity and justice, so far are they holy and above
sin. Yet in any of these religions where it is taught that man can do any
wickedness while in the body, and repent and call on the name of these
idols the hour before he leaves the body, that he will that day be received
in paradise, is a heinous sin against the laws of God.
Some people say they have felt the spirit and power of Jesus-how is that?
We once knew a man on earth who called all his servants Mary. He treated
than with great deference, and they rendered to him gocd service. One day,
his neighbor said to him, "Sir why do you call that woman Mary; that is not
her real name?" And he replied, "I know that her name is Macy, for she came
when I called, and she has given me great comfort. rt Even so do many people
call God by the name o! Jesus; and when spirits come and comfort them and
bless them, they verily believe in their blindness that the man Jesus was
with them.. This is no sin, but blindnesfi.
OF THE GROWTH OF THE SPIRITo
By what process do es the spirit grow?
Similar to the growth of the gross body.. While the body grows by the ab-
sorption of gross materials, the spirit extracts from the same materials the
elements that increase the spiritual body..
How then of children that die in infancy?
They grow also, but more rarefied, for their sustenance comes from a
spiritual source. They have nurses and guardians ..
Have we not all guardian spirits around us?
No. Originally, yes. Those amongst you who have become base or stiff-
necked are deserted by all spirits save evil ones.
SPIRI'£ALIS ~ J'l.
What are evil spirits?
Perv·erse creatures who led evil lives on earth, and who being born
into the spirit world. found no friends. They can not rise out of their
own degradation, nor do they know who they a re. They grope about on
earth, seeking fellows like themselves, and they lead men and women into
crime~ Scme of these spirits were murderers on earth~ and you hung them,
and thought you got rid of them by sending them to uso This was a crime
in you, for these hangings are visited back upon your society.-it
*In looking over the so-called civilized portions of
the globe, one can not but believe that our laws for
capital punishment are based on a false religion. If
there ever is a mockery in the face of God, it is in
ourselves and our priests kneeling on one side of a
man, while the hangman on the other is preparing to
send his soul into eternity.. We are virtually saying,
''Here, God, come and take him. He is not good enough
for us." But in reference to spirits influencing people
to criminal acts, how can we prove that it is not so'?
The little girl recently arrested here for trying to
burn up babies, said something in her made her do it.
So did the Boston boy, arrested for mutilating other
little boys.
You spoke of music in the spirit world: what can we understand of that?
We have music, instrumental and vocal. We: have produced them wholly within
ourselves at some of your circles •.;~
'*This is attested to by 5evera.l circh'!s in t.hls country
and in England. For my own part; I have never heard it..
OF IDENTITY.
Can you explain why it is that the spirits can so seldom identify themselves
to us, in their otherwise lengthy communications?
Many of the spirits are entirely different from what you would suppose... As
stated before, you: on earth behold the silver-plating only; we see the raw
material after the piating is stripped off. Do you understand us?
We should like a further illustration.
We .thought so. Well, amongst you are m:any persons who may be called intelli-
gent by you, who have only borrowed stuffo When they come to the spirit world,
and are obliged to manufacture ideas of their own, and when they are no longer
mere quoters or· other men.1 s ideas, they are real dummies.. On earth, they could
please you amazingly by quoting Milton or Dante, but here they find everything
so' different that nothing which they were acquainted with applies to the case..
They make a mess: or· every thing they touch. If you will remember, in the early
discoveries of gold in California, you had many men at home who were rree to
tell you of an easy method to dig all you wanted.. They could devise steam
SPIRITAI.IS .. JB~
plows and sifters that would render it mere child's play to be a gold-miner.
Their ideas were quoted in the newspapers as wonderfully intelligent.. Well,.
by and by, they went there, and when they were confronted by the rocks and
rushing rivers they were dum.founded. The intelligence they thought they had
was mere nonse11se; so when. they wrote home, they contented themselves by
merely relating what the hard-fisted miners told themp When the 'spirit comes
into the spirit world, he finds that, in order to send a message back to his
friends on earth, through some medium, he is headed off on all sides by rocks
and rivers that he knew not of. So, he is often obliged to content himself
by conveying his intelligence viva voce through perhaps a hundred different
spirit.s before t.he message reached you. And, in the next place, he learns
that 1'rha.t seemed like good sense on earth is mere nonsense when viewed from
the spirit worldo And yet there is another difficulty from your side of the
que~jt.ion; that is, when your millionaire comes amongst us,, and finds that,
al.though on eart.h he was of such great magnitude, here his spirit is a poor,
sickly nobody, which was robbed of its legitimate growth by too much devo-.
tion to earthly matters. He is ashamed to tell you who he is, even if he
could. This man lived two lives. You saw the outside one, and thought he
was great; but his real spirit you saw not. That part which you saw is really
and virtually dead~ The connecting link between his earthly thoughts and his
thoughts of spirit life was too weak to stand the strainG He is for a long
time in spirit life occupying a back seat, and with as little noise as possible.
Let us give you an illustration: You have amongst you a millionaire, who
visits France and loses all his money. Now, he moves into a back-street, and
keeps quiet lest his friends find him, and shame· him.. So is it with many who
are haughty and proud on earth: their cloak is stripped off in the spirit ·
world; their poverty in.truth and love is lamentable, and they a.re wrl:tten .
all over with crimes done in the body$ None of these classes will identify
themselves to you. They do not wish to attract attention on our side either,
or to call our attention to the fact that they carried false colors before
you..
They can constitute but a small part of community?
That is true; but your acknowledged prominent men are mostly under this
head. The poor mechanic or laborer whose identity was only known to a few
of his neighbors, for he carried his soul open to view, and his heart was
pure as snow, he can come back and identify himself to his own dear ones.
One reason why· he can come is because he knows that he will be received by
warm, loving hearts. Their attraction helps to draw him back; their love
meets him half way. But in the other cases, no love goes forth to meet
them on the road. On this point, let us charge yo~ to lay it tenderly to
your most sacred thoughts: love attracts and hate ·Fepels spirits. We do
know a spirit here who would like to communicate with his friends in New
York, and they were persons who loved him. But while he was in earth-life,
he cheated several parties out of their fortunes--in fact, ruined them.
Their curse is upon him. Now, because of their curse, he can not approach
your great city; for as soon as he comes near the place, his great crimes
swallow up his whole concentration of thought and he is helplesso Therefore,
we charge you, live with no man's curse upon you, for if it be grounded in
justice, your torment will be terrible indeed. To those you have wronged,
seek at once to make amends; for while you are in the flesh, you have tools
J
SPIRI'rALIS ..
to work with, and may repair the damage quickly,, which if left till you'
enter spirit-life may require a thousand years to accomplish it.. You who
were devoted in love to those gene before can have their spl.rits return,
to you almost whenever you wish, provided you confo:rm to the now known
laws of spirit communion; and especially Lr y~u are· ali pure: and good.
Why d-9 spirit-circles require to be held in the dark?
We have nearly overcome that, and in a few generation·s hope to. do so
entirely.. In the early sitt·ing of a. circle, it should be dark, be9'a~se
darkness interrupts your positive concentration of tho~ght, and ,bec.alf~~ it
promote.s the aame concentration of thought in the spirit... But vmen you
yourselves have advanced in spirit intercourse so that you can .render. your
thoughts passive in daylight, then the spirits wili have power to convey
intelligence to you without darkness..
You have spoken of spirits coming back to us when we are alone, and espec-
ially when asleep: how is that?
Provided your system is i_n a perfectly quiet state, and your. thoughts
peaceful,, we can. come and enter into conversation with you. We can often
thus talk diree:tly with you,. and you do answer us. .We can show you pie-
. '- tures and convey' various illustrations to your own spirit. O:t course
when you wake up, you see us not, and so you call it a dream. But this
we! as.sure you, there is no such thing as. th inking the talk of two or more
characters w:i.t hin one's self but by other spirits.
Do: we not often hold oo nversation within our oWri selves when we are
walking alone?
One side of it is yours; the other side is generally· carried on by means
or your spirit companions who. are consulting or contending with you, .and
they do use your organs and make you seem to talk both sides..
Hbw did Shakespeare write different characters?
He· was attended by a vast multitude of spirits, and they virtually·
and really played and spoke their parts, entering within his own spirit.
And in this way also are there many amongst you who do have spirits ·enter
into their own organism, and help them to speak and write, and yet such
persons, not knowing· the laws of spirit. power, do arrogat~ to thelselves
ail they accomplisho In this way, as we ·told you before, you have many
lit.eraey men amongst you, who, on entering the spirit world, are seem-
ingly vastly inferior to what they were on earth.
What is- a. trance?
Even as just stated, and nothing more; save that your own identity is
then mastered, and the spirits alone speak through you.
SPIRI'I.'ALI s.. 20 •.
What is insanity?
It is twofold. In a diseased physical body the spirit is unable to
wield the person. In the other case, s piri"ts do often take possession
of the person. In some instances, many spirits do struggle in and get
possession of the person. Such are evil spirits, a.s before spoken of.,
These can be driven away (or cast out) by any good person calling upon
his ovm attendant spirits to drive hence the evil spiritEJ of the afflic-
ted one.. In some cases of insanity, there are both a diseased organism
and e'xil spirits. ·
w:v::.t 7 then, of our asylums?
Insane asylums, like prisons, are favorable resorts for evil spirits,
for in a multitude of spirits there is strength.
Why do evil spirits come back to haunt the living?
Why do your own thieves steal from you who are good'? So is it wi.th them..
Evil spirits are grasping for spirit food and strength. · They are vampires
that lo'le to draw sustenance from the fount wher.e your own spirit feeds.
Many of you denying the laws of spirits and thus receiving not your own
spirit friends to s.hield you, become the prey of evil spirits·.. · This doc-
trine we urge upon you to teach to all t.he world., that .they who know these
things. may be saved the torments o·f the damned.. For ina·sm,ich as you pray
for good and pure spirits to come unto you, so shall you drive hence those
which 'lre evil. We see amongst you many people who, .in their vainglory in
the old and perverted. doctrines, do· say that even i.f the new revelations
from the spirit world were true, yet ·they '\i\QUld deny them. · This is pain-
ful to us, for a.s the words go out of their. mouths, so do evil spirits
enter into them, leading them on 'to destruction. We beseech yoi..1, there-
fore, that you caution such people not to be too indiscreet, against the
laws of God, but seeking rather tha. t they may learn. the truth beforehand.
In speaking of communications being given to us while we dream, how is'it
tha.t we are afflicted with evil dreams when we have been abusing our di-
gestive organs?
The activity o.f. your nervous system is likened unto a fire in a great
city, where, in the distress, all the riff-raffs congregate to steal and
plunder..
WhatJ do wee too, then, have evil spirits around us?
Even so; and it behooves you, therefore, to obey the laws of health,
both in eating and drinking. Though be not hasty in attributing all your
horrid dreams to evil spirits, ·for much of it is a: dera.ngement of your
nervous system 9

How can it be reconciled to our i:mdersta.nding of justice, when we see a
man amongst us who, by fraud and rascality, or even by_ close financial·
transactions, has amassed a great fortune and en.joys all the luxuries of
earth, while another who is strictly honest and good .lives in poverty,
even though he struggles hard all the days of his life?
As· it has been told you, the one is lc:i.ying up treasures in heaven,, and
the other treasures on eartho Such a poor man as you menti.on. shall have
his paradise in the spirit world, for his spirit is receiving the.·knowl-
edge, power, and 1011e that endure to all eternity. On the other hand, he
that is evil, be he ever so rich on earth, is only p·ostponing his labors.
Take, therefore, this comfort to the poor, who are honest and oharitable
to one another, and say to them the first shall be last, and the last shall
be t'irst, and they can underst~md.
Then shall the rich give away their riches?
That muld be folly, for the poor would waste it. You should preach:
these truths unto all1 men,. and let the rich choose for themselves what they
will ..
What need is there of preaching?
This is the third revelation. First, of God; second, of life beyond
the grave; third, the nature of the spirit world,, that all men may embrace
that which has been prepared for them.
What have you· to say of our churches- we mean Christian churches generally?
We would that they were places of comfort to the poor and sorrowing~ We
would that they were places where the rich came once a week to visit the
poor, the sick, and lame, and blind, bringing of their ample stores some
f::ubstantial comfort that .{llight be remembered when they have pas~ed away. We
would that your preachers were blind to the written law$ of their church,
and would come forth toward Almighty God 'in confidence, preaching from the
great works surpassing all counterfeit... For what man is. there amongst you
that can not write a book and laws, and say, ''Come, beholdt this is from.
God"? But who shall make a world and laws· to govern it? And yet 5o far as
your churches promote charity, lov:e·, a.nd justice, they are good...
..
Who shall stand higher in the spirit world: he. that does good all his life:
but prays not, or he that depends on prayer for his own salvation?' ·
! .
We would put this question to you, that were you sick or in need of
.... food, which of these would you prefer?
\.Jha.t is ~he value of prayer?
It is a sin to pray to God for that which, if given you, muld injure
o·thers. It.. is a folly to p;ray to Gbd to remove malaria ~rom your c:ity
when it should be done by draining. It ts not a sin to pray God to give
you strength of spirit, and to send his good angels- to assist you, for
,.
SPI RI TALI .S. 22..
this may be answered and harm no man •.
How shall a man pray'?
GOD AND ANGELS HELF ME! GIVE ME LIGHT AND KNOWLEDGE, PURITY A.ND
JUSTICE OF SPIRIT; TEACH ME CHARITY, BENEVOLENCE, AND LOVE TOWARD
EVERY THING THAT LIVES.
Let this prayer be for ever within your· hearts, and let it be con-
tinually in your minds when you are alone, but whisper it when you are
conv~iroing with God ..
What can you say for the heathen?
Have we not been advising you..! For we would ask, whom do you judge
yourselves to be?
A.re there not those who have not had the gospel among them?
Whose gospel? for there a.re manyo In the spirit world, our gospel
is: good wo:rks, and no other.. We know of no race of msn but have had
this...
\-Jhat calling in earth...;life shall bestow on man the highest spirit a.d-
vancement?
That by which he can render the greatest good to the greatest number
of God's creatures, especially to his fellows.. The direct producers
from the earth or elementary sources stand foremost amongst men.... You
have amongst you a large community of non-producers who contribute no
good to any living thing-men who live on the sustenanc.e of cihe.rs, with-
out giving any equivalent: your rich man,. that lives e.lone, transacting
no business; your barterer, that liv.es by shaving his fellows in every
transaction; your lawyer, that lives by setting man against man·; your
judge, that takes a bribe; your congressman, that cheats his country;
your trader in poisonous liquorso These are all vampires amongst you,
and when they enter the spirit world, they are little better than
spiritual vampires, many of them remaining in torment for thousands of
yea.rs. Their souls: are so 'be.rren of all that is Godlike, that it is
almast ir.tpossible for them to be quickened into that purity and love
which look upward.. For 1 et it be borne in mind, that not only all the
deeds done in the body shall be answered for, and all the debts and mis-
demeanors paid for, but good works must also be done unto others before
the spirit can ariseo
Are we to understand that guardian spirits are always with us?
Spirits are always with you, and if you are good and pure, they are
your companions.. If you are given :to lust, then· do good spirits des3rt
you, and you are set upon by evil spirits, who feast upon your substance~
So is it with those who steal or rob or cheat or speak falsely against

their fellow-men; the spirits that a.re to be their society come unto them
and follow them continually, ev~n after they have entered the spirit worldo
OF HARRIAGE.
What have you to say of marriage?
Whatl, have we no choice?
. Yes; but the spirits prepare t,he way beforehand.. Where persons have
strong passions, they sometimes become the victims of mischievous spirits.
The spirits wouid seldom or never lead persons to an unhappy marriage,
provided the parties choosing compa.nions would heed their most loving im!-
pressions. Unfortunately, many of you ignore the spirits' choice, and rest
instead on some mercenary basd s. When a marriage is made between you, we
have a spiritual feast in honor of the evento New spirit friends are then
introduced to you ..
Wnat shall be done with unhappy marriages?
One law we have found that is, good, that all such should separate if they
so choose; but neither should marry again while the. other lives on earth..
Why not marry again?
AEr many be seen amongst you, whoever has put away his wife to marry another,
or whoever has put away or fled from her husband to marry another, is without
the guidance of pure spirits, but becomes the prey of those who feast upon the
issue of lust ..
Suppose, at the time of marriage, that both parties were apparently pure
and good, but shortly after the husband becomes a drunkard, and beats his
wife as if she were a dog?
She should have the privilege of lea.ving him, and their effects should be
divided justly.. This is written upon their own spirits.. Nor c·an they travel
never so far, but other spirits C'an read it in them. They now owe a debt to
, the spirit. world which must be canceled in the spirit world by the death and
forgiv,eness of one of themo
!ibw is it with those who ha.ve more than one: wife or one husband?
Good spirits stay not with these.. Have you not eyes that you can see about
you?
SPIRITALIS ..
Which is· the most sacred· - the birth, the marriage; or the death of a man?
They are the same. The spirits always attend you on all these occasions,.
and :;."'ejoice with you or mourn with you,. as the case may be;. for .the.law of: •.-
marriage, we would charge you, that you teach all men and women, that when
they become married, they shall lock up their DaritaL.love from all the
world beside themselves.. Nor shall they hear, nor see, nor even think of
marital love with any other person, neither in this nor the spirit world.
Is it not taught by many spirits, that when husband and wife can not longer
li.ve together, they should not only separate, but marry again to other
companions?
It may be so taught~
Then whom shall we obey?
Remember this- the facts! Remember the facts! Who can you mention ~hat,
havingthus separated, and then married again, but misery has. come upon one or
both? And who do you suppose is to pay for this? But why shall you obey
either? Have you no judgment of your own? We told you that we found this
law was good, and we assume only to be, human as you are.
Is not marriage merely an arrangement between two parties?
That is not all, and herein do many erro The marriage relation belongs
not only to the husband and wife, but to their heirs and the corrununity; and
to the spirit world also.. The law, there.fore, that governs marriage should
not be for the good and pure only, but to protect the weak against those who
are sinfully inclined.
OF THE GOVERNM~NT OF CHILDREN
What c·an you suggest?
The things we have taught you for yourselves, teach you also to your
children.
Why are some children in a family inclined to evil, while others in the same
family are good?
The pa.rents transgressed some law during the incipient life... The evil
that was in them is thus visited on their children, and this may continue to
one or mo re generationso
Shall children be whipped?
That is a question for yourselves to answer.

OF THE GOVERT\.'MENT OF PRISONS ..
Shall malicious and dangerous prisoners be! flogged for disobedience?
This is for yourselves: to answer.. We would say to you, do the best you
can for them,.
OF THE GOVERNMENT OF A NATION..
What can you suggest on national government?
Government should advance with the people:•. In early days, king:;,.
emperors, and potentates were necessary. With the spread of intelli-
gence amongst the masses, they became dissatisfied, desiring a voice in
the general government themsel11es.- Then came 1 iberal monarchies. But in
due time, even these were unsatisfactory, and then came reµublics.. These
changes; are inevitable to all people under the sum..
Ours is a republic; wherein can it be improved, or is it really the highest
form of earthly government?
The highest! 0 vain, vain man! When wi 11 you learn that there is no
perfection on th is side 0 f eternity? Many,, many changes shall follow your
republic; many goYernr.i.ents arise and go out of memory before the highest
· shall be reached. Even now,. do your wise men all feel that your gov;errment
is far behind the~ requirements of the people.. Even now are curses rising up
amidst you against the tyranny and c:.orruption of your government.. But woe
unto you, who,, seeing this, exclaim, What! shall we go back to monarchy!
OhL of what little heed and perc:eption is man1 Verily do we say to you, you
shall not go backward.. You should straighten it up a little here and there,.
and in due time you shall lose sight of your present republic. ·
We admit our defections; can you suggest a remedy?
Tour greatest defect is fraud in office ... That is the first to which you
should apply the axe. Your impeachment laws should be abolished, and your
investigating committees disbanded~
Who, then, should try officers for their malfeasance?
Their masters, the people... At stated. times, the people should elect fronr
their most intelligent and responsible citizens, a large body of triers, whose
onfy' dUty it should be to try and to punish official pilferers.. The triers
should be selected from the producing part of your community, and they should
try all such cases within themselves in their own way, for they should stand
above the written laws, except in their relation to the people; their office
need interfere but little with their daily avocations .. -><
Your laws for the. collection of debts should be abolished, and only a
written cont~act made binding...
SPIRITALIS ..
* In further explanation, this spirit (so-called)
said that the triers should be composed of more
than half the freeholders or other responsible
persons, and that their own delegates should
constitute the court~ ·
Do spirits trouble themselves much about our national affairs?
The same as it is with you; some do, some do not... Men who left the earth
with some unfinished affair on their minds, often come back and tcy to work
it out. Men who lived good and pure lives, and settled up all their affairs
satisfactorily before they left the earth, seldom return.. Persons who live
to a ripe old age become almost weaned away from earth before their departure..
What can we understand by spheres as the term is used J:>y spirits?
A life. Your ea.rth-life is one sphere. Our spirit-life is the second
sphere... iJhen we spirits pass on (or die, as you call it), we enter the
ethereal sphere, which is the third sphere~
How many spheres are there?
Many of you on earth say there is but one; many in the spirit world say
there are but two, and there is the end. But we have amongst us manifesta-
tions from those who have gone into the ethereal sphere, and these again
assure us that there is still another life beyond that~ But when we, who
are speaking to you, venture our opinion, we would say, there are many
lives and many deaths; each succeeding one becoming more sublimated and
Godlike. As your clairvoyants. can see into the spirit world, so ours can
see into the ethereal world, and these again into the next, and so on, ad
infinitum..
Is it possible for those who have gone into the third sphere to return to
earth and manifest ,themselves?
We think not.
Is it possible for persons who have been dead a thousand years to return
to earth?
Only by representation or proxy in other spiritso
We have a friend who says he gets communications from Jesus and Mary, and
Bartholomew: how is that?
He is a victim in whom some frolicking; mischievous spirits. are hawing
sport~
We: know a lady who gives poems from Burns, who has been dead a hundred yearsr
how is that?
It may be him or his proxy...
... ,i
SPIRITALIS.
How shall we know when a spirit is really the person he represents
himself?
It is not necessary, generally... If' it is,. he will make his identity
urunistakable to you--that is,. provided you do not absorb his forces, and
then think it is the echo of your own mindo Many spirits, however, in
the spirit world do not know they can return to you. When we, who are
talking to you, tell them so, they call us humbugs, the same as you call
your mediums...
Do the spirits realize that it is expensive for us to investigate
spiritism?
It should cost you nothing. We· charge you nothing.. And if you will
form circles of ten or fifteen persons amongst yourselves, and meet reg-
ularly once a week in our name and the name of God, we will be with you...
This you should do as long as you live, and you will be happy~ You should
cultivate singing, sweet and gentle, such as you would sing to your friends
who have gone to the g~ave ..
You have now given us quite a history of the spirit and its powers and of
its places of abode; this, we presume, has caused you a great deal of
exertion, and we return you our sincere thanks. But before you go, will
you not please give us some definite answer in regard to.who you are?
· (No answer.)
Has this matter been gone over with me before by the, same spirit?
It· was:, commenced seventeen years ago ...
Is: it from the spirit of some person I ever knew on earth?
(No answer.. )
There are several reasons why I should be curious just now: you spoke of
California--well, I have been there; you spoke of triers being elected by
the people, in order to correct the great frauds done by our officials
throughout the oountry--well, above a year ago, I advocated in my paper
nearly the same thing. Therefore, the question forces itself on me, as
to whether you be not really an echo from myself and the audience assem-
bled, having the vital fore es of the medium for your enunciating principle?
I see that the medium is unconscious; is it not reasonable for me to infer,
that what intelligence he had (which is gone out of him) is here acting
upon emanations from our bodies? ·
In reference to triers, which you published as you refer to, the ideas.
c:arn.e from us at the time you wrote the article. But· instead of getting
our illustration complete at that ti.r.re, you got only a part, and then you
proposed constitutional jurors.* We had no control over you, but merely
passed what we would designate an intellectual light before you... It is
SPI RITALIS. 28.
most probably you· thought to yourse1r·, that a new thought. struck you, ·
which is a common illustration given by ratecting people to the new
ideas which they receive from sp1.rits•· · The idea of electing triers, .
we have endeavored to inst ill into the minds of many of. the. most pro- ..
found thinkers of this country. In reference to the ihtelligence·or •·
the medium going out of ·him and being here to manifest itself,. it.
would prove a. spiritual body capable of acting independent o.f· the
physical body in so far as. it has control here and not in t.he medium...
But we often come when the medium is not entranced.. How is; that?
* It is true I used the term constitutional
jurors in the article referred to.
Can not there be a principle of double within those media?
(Nb answer.. )
When a person is stunned by a violent blow; or when under the in-
fluence of chloroform; or under the influence of opium--when, in
fact,. the intellectual portion of man is apparently gone, have we not
p:rima-facie evidence that when the physical body ls dead, the whole
principle is dead al so?
Under these conditions, the spirit is not able to ·control the· .
physical body. Spirl ts can not remain in an atmosphere of· chloroform•.
They ,.,retire .in a measure from· the body, and henc.e the per~on is· not
sensible to pain.
We: see the spirits who materialize themselv:es come with clothes .on:
how is that?
(No answer. )
I am well pleased with all I have heard from you, bllt still there is
one point on which I am not satisfied, and that is the identity?
We would ask you this: how would you identify the man that built
the Erie Railway? ·N·ow, we know you. would answer that it was. bU:ill.t by
many; nor is there scarce a rail in all that line that could be pointeq ·
out so as to identi.fy the person who. laid it.. And yet we: may give you·
a better illustra~_ion; as this: go. ask the postman to identify your . ·
fri.end whose letter he brings, and whom he knows not. But more of
this anon. ·
Since all spirits can ·come back to the people on earth1 and advise and
teach us whatsoever doctrine they may choose, will not our standard
landmarks or· piety and religion bA· ·overthrown?
That was what was said of Galileo.. The people of his time feared ··
too many philosophies. ·Now, the people on earth have lenmed that the·
more philosophies they have, the better it is for ·them, for they oni;r
'·
SPIRITALIS...
accept a few, and throw. the chaff away°' Were a philosopher now to teacn
that the earth is a flat bod;y, what influence would he have? .. So is it
v1ith spirit communications.. You have had a few during all ages of the
wor:lldo- Why should you coqfine yourselves to those few? Were a spirit
now to tell you that a horseshoe over the door would keep evil spirit~
a.way, you would tell him to go ahout his business. rr· a spirit- now were
to tell you that Quakers should be burned,. you would drive him henae....
Ii'· a spirit were to tell you that a horse-hair tied· about a stone and
thrown into a well would keep your child from having bronchitis,. you
would banish him as a foolish spirit.. Whoever knew a histor,y that· was
true? And how shall we ever give to the people of earth a true history
of the spirit world? From every grade of lite· will you get. hisif~ries o:f
the great hereafter, and every one will speak from his own standpolnt ..
Quack doctors, who have no knowledge of chemistry or botany.. will ply
you with herbs as worthless as granite or marble, becau.se, forsooth,.
some spirit told them to... But why will you be cheated? Can not you
also get knowledge:? And can you· not try the spirits that come to you
and prove the things. they "teach.. But this we can a:pprise you,. that
spirits: may teach you o•f' spiritual things... You yourselves should leam
earthly things also~
REMARKS ON THE FOREGOING.
When we view ruined Italy and Spain, and especially the former, where
Christianity ruled both temporal and spiritual things for hundreds of
years, and observe the. almost qbliterated sense of justice, benevolence,
and decency aJnongst the generality of the people" we may:- well pause and
ask,. mether their religion has such a proper restraining· and. elevating
influence as to desrewe our approval. ·
When we view our own beloved- country, where all forms of Christianity
hav& struggled as if irn a moral race, and observe that all the affairs of
our govemiment are a stupendous aggregate o:f fraud, and that the.re is
sc:arce an officer, from a senator to a judge, that c·an be- believed undle·r
his solemn oath, we IlllatY' well pa.use and ask,. whether our religion has such
a proper restraining and elevating influence as to deserve our £\lrther
support... The fears of bell, such as were preached even thirty years ago~
are vanished.. The intelligence of the people is shocked at the .iclea of
a heaven where people are only to sit bowing and smiling for evero- The
foolish advocate of. Cb.ristianity may say that the fault of' the people is
in not embracing the religion in its· entirety. Ind that may be true... :i:,u.t.
what ait it?' We· must take the people a.a we see them. They are getting
worse.. Italy and Spain are in :feartul degradation... Our own oountry in-
creases in· fraud c'ontinually... These: are fac:ts..... No1 intelligent. person
will attempt to deny theD;l... Is "there not a prayer within the heart ot
every noble-minded man that God may send us something t.o help us in our
distress? Do n:ot the more scientific, who have become alienated trom
Christianity on accowmt of its indefiniteness, desire and stand in need
ot 11 positive proof or· the end or continuation of man?'
SPIRITALIS.
It were well once to say that God created the world, and the people
were satisfied. But now the people wish to know how he created it~ It
were well once to· say that the spirit of man survived. the .death of the.·. ·
body, and the people were satisfied. But now the people warit to) know
how it can survive.. It were well once to say that the good went to
heawen and the bad to hell,. and the people were satisfied... But now the
people wish to know how he does,. and what kind o·f .places those are toi
which he is going.. This inquisitive intelligence in man was' given him:.
by God himself. And shali man not improve his talents?
DOUBTS~
One me.y well ask, if spirits, as they are called, do survive the·
death of the body, and can return and so clothe themselves with material
substances that they can be identified, why do not such well-known persons
as Greeley, Lincoln, or Webster return before a good and intellec,tual body
of scientists, so as to put the rr.atte.r at rest? We, do not doubt Professor
Crookes; the doubt is in reference to the thing he saw.. Katie King makes
herself an anonymous person.. She: professes tO be a spirit. Well, Su.pposeo
we bGlieve that? That still is no proof that she ever inhabited a body
like ourselves ..
CONCLUSIONS.
One concl11sion is arri. ved at by every person who has given this subject.
a fair investigation: that is, the phenomena are the same as recorded in:
the Old and New Testament.. The mediumistic power is the same thing that in
olden times enabled persons to announce themselves a$ prophets or gods~
THE EFFECT.
A. very little observation will convince a reflecting person of two·
things: that spiritism, a.s it is cp.lled, takes a higher moral rank than
the churches of this period, having a more ennpbling influence over its
adherents; and that, fastening as it does in literary and scientific minds,
it will soon be the religion of the world. It, is a liberalization of the
mortl and reflect:tve faculties from the influence of priestcraft, silni.lar
to republicanism over monarchism. They are both the natural and inevitable
result of educating the masses to think tor themselves.

miraculous stories> and singular theories that have, o:f late· years, been
ri.fe, :in this country and in Europe,. regarding the alleged daily inter-
course between us mortals and the inhabitants of· the other world.. But,
as the: subject has; rec:ently a:ttracled the attention of' not.ed scientists
and men of letters on bo·th stl..de·s of' the Atlantie, and as some of' these
gentlemen have ma.de: mo'st remarkable: disc-losures in conn:Erction with it,
out of' deference to their opinions, and in the interest of the publi.c and
the press., we have obtained: some' trustworthy facts in the premises which
we~ lay> before· the reader, without attempting to advance any theory as to;
their possible utility on' origin..
Although a belief' in "Mo©ie:rn Spiritualism," as this "new departure"
is termed, has· existed among no contemptible numb:er in both hemispheres
fo·r now upward' of twenty years, and no·twithstanding that such able men as
tha Hon.. Hobert Dale Owen, the late Judge Edmonds and Professor Hare, etc•.,
had set their seals to it in a manner the most emphatic, within a few
months only has it assumed a serious and threatening aspect; inasmuch as
it appears to have thrown down the gauntlet to the· scientifiC'. world, and
challenged investigation as to the objective character o.f its pl:lenomena...
The lists were entered in England by Mro· William Crookes, editor of' the
London Quarterly Jouma.l. of Science,. a Fellow of the Royal Society, and
a chemist of' high standing:; Mr.. c. F.. Varley,. an able electrician;,. and am
F.R.S.. also, and by Mr. Alfred Wallaa.e, who shares with Darwin the honor
of promulgating the theo:ey of "Natural Selection.. 1t The investigations of'
these gentlemen were earried on p'rincipally- at the residence of MroCrookes
and that of a Mr.. and Mrs,.. Cook, through the mediumship. of whose daughter,
Miss Florence Cook, the manifestations, as they ar.e termed,. took place...
Judging from the published statements of Messrs .. Crookes and Wallae.e, as
well as .from the evidence of Mr. Varley and that of severa]_ members o)f the
legal and medical professions,. such precautionary measures were, adopted
and scientifie teats applied which precluded the possibility, as alleged,.
af' any thing like mis:apprehension or fraud.,. Immediately prior to the i
opening of the s 1 eances, the medium was done up with seals and whipcord,.
like a valuable express package, and placed in a dark closet or cabinet,
that bete noir· of skeptics.. Here, as: asserted, she remained in a.Ill en-
tranced state to the close of' the s 'eanee, a:nd s:o connected with con-
duc:ting wires pas:sing through the cabinet-door f'rom an electric: machine
that her slightest movement was registered by the instrument~
While in this helpless and unconscious condition, a presumed spirit form,
said to be that of one Katie King, who lived about the time oif Cromwell,,
and who revisited th~s earth, for the first time, a little over three· years
ago, emerged from the cabinet, and walked and chatted freely, time and again,
with the investigators and their friends"' She was, of course-, clad in the
~ traditional whi.te, .flowing robes or the "SummJer Land, tt but, what is still
more extraordinary, so material were they, she c:ut port.ions from them and

excited, as may be supposed; but Katie; after a sojourn of three years

b,..eeds contempt," ga¥e notice that her missic;m, whatever it may have·
been, should terminate beneath the red flag· or· St. George, on the twenty-
first day of last May, as, at that date, she was to step into a higher
sphere. This allusion to her sudden exaltation is thought by some to
have· been a stinging bit of sarcasm, as the next place she turned up·
was in the neighboring city of Philadelphia, in a ~all three-story
brick house, in North Ninth street, where, through the agency of a Mr.
and Mrs. H9lmes--two very commonplace persons indeed, and of no lit.erary
attainments whatever--she has been manifesting herself, until quite re-
cently, in a manner more emphatic and inc,omprehensible,. were' such pos-
sible, than that which characterized her appearances on the other side
o,f the Atlantic ..
Once within hail of her, as; it were, we soon found ourselves in the
Quaker City, standing, about seven o'clock in the evening, before· the
house just alluded to; and., determined not to fall, if' possible, a victim
t,o collusion, illusio:1, or· delusion, we stepped into a small music-store
that occupies nearly the whole of the ground flat,, to inspect the ceiling
t>iat forms, so to speak, the under part of the floor of the room in the
second story, where the s' ea.nces are held.. This we found to be one un-
broken expanse of white, w:i. thout even the slightest flaw or trace that
might indicate any secret trap-door or mode of communlcation with the
apartment overhead.. Besides, we had already .ascertained that the pro-
prietors of the store were above suspicion, and persons who could not be
induced to lend them·sel ves to any description of fraud ..
H'aving sought and gained admission at the' side door, which leads to
the apartments occupied by the Holmeses, we paused, by pennission,. fbr a.
short space to examine the narrow hall and stairway; but finding' nothing
of a suspicious· character here, we leisurely as.certded the steps before us>
and making one 11 right about face'' on the first landing,· under the direction
or· our guide, we· speedily found ourselves in the presence of the mediums,
and a few persons seated in the mellow, roseate light of a stained-glas:s ·
lamp that burned on a small table in one corner of a very plainly carpeted
and furnished room. about eighteen feet square.. To this room, as we soon
assured ourselves, there is now but one mode of ingress--that by which we
entered--which, if we except the chimney and the two windows that looked.· ·
out on Ninth street, is the only mode or· egress also. To the right, as
you· enter, a partition of plain walnut .boards, as seen in our engraving
of the apartment, cuts off a small· corner of' the room diagonally> present-
ing in appearance the front of a large comer cupboard six feet in width,
and reaching from the floor to the ceiling. The walls of this room are
made to answer for the sides of this triangular closet, which are· respec-
tively two feet· two inches and four feet nine inches wide--the lesser
width being on the side or the mantelpiece.. The· door in the centre, as
shown in our illustration, is six feet three inches in h.eight by two feet
in width_, and the pentagonal aperture above it, which is about seven feet
from the floor,. is· ten inches wide by twelve in height. The other smaXl

opening, a little lower down, and on one side, is twelve inches wide
by fourteen in height. Before both these pe,ntagonal openings there
hangs inside a small curtain of coarse black stuff, a fabric with which
the back of the cabinet is covered also. In the larger of the interior
sides of" this closet there is a door communicating with an adjoining
room; but so unmistakably securely in this boarded up, neither entrance
nor exit can be effected by it. Across the upper part of the walnut
partition, and between the smaller pentagonal aperture and the ceiling,
there runs a wide strip of dark stuff similar to that just mentioned,
and which has any thing but an artistic effecte
The door of this ca.binet, whi.ch is always closed at the commencement
of a s' eance .• ar:d in which condi t.ion we found it on entering the room,
is fastened on t.he outside by a brass latch-hook that falls into a brass
staple. This hook, which i.s placed convenient to the lower small opening,
can be easily reached from within, so that any one confined in the cab-
inet can :r\:iadi ly put out h.is or her hand and undo the latch.
'rhe ob,ject of our visit being at once surmised by the two mediums, who
welcomed us co.rdially ~ but who are not sho ~m in our engraving, we were
requested to i.nspect the cn.bine t and the room before we took our seat
among· those assembled. This we did with a vengeance, and sat down sat-
isfied that the cabinet wa$ empty, and that. there was no .mode o:f ente~
ing it or escapi.ng from it save by the door or the pentagonal openings..
The light being now lowered a little, but not so as to render surrounding
objects invisible in w.1y degree, we were one and all requested to join
in singing, for the pi:1rpose, .it was said, of· 1tharmonizing the influences."
Preferring to keep our eye upon the small openings, and the cabinet-door,
that, after our inspection:· had been closed and latched, we declined to
give any specimen of our vocal powers, although those about us began to~
sing,· and most tunefully, some melody that was unknown to us. In the
course of a few moments, we thought that we perceived the curtain that
hung· before the lower pentagonal. aperture move; and scarcelyhad the idea
taken possession of us when the white and shapely a rm of a woman was
thrust through the opening, and the latch that fastened the door lifted,
by apparently soft, taper fingers, out of the staple.. The arm was· now
withdrawn, and almost instantly afterward a sweet, young· face appeared
at the same aperture, with a soft low "good:..evening," which we must cpn-
fess rather astonished us. .The salutation being eagerly returned by all
present, one of the mediums, neither of' whom moved from our side during
the seance, asked the mysterious visitant whether she thought she should
be able to leave the cabinet. during the s 1 eance, when she replies, 11 1
will try. 11 This phase of the phenomena was what we .most desired to witness ..
No'r were we kept long in suspense; for, in a very few minutes, the cabinet-
door opened slowly, and out stepped, in full view of us. all, and just as
she is represented in our illustration, the so-called spirit of the now
famous Katie King!. Although set down as a denizen of the other world, she
seemed to us to be as objective a. reality as ever trod this earth! She
walked among· us, permitted us to touch her hands and her vmite robe; and
spoke to us in good, round modern English, which we considered somewhat.

extraordinary,. seeing that she lived upward or· two hundred years ago,
when the quaintness of' Spenser overshadowed .her native tongue. This
and some kindred circumstances, which haq previously come to our kriowl-
edge, we did not pause to analyze at the moment, for we felt that she
was; a very mysterious being, at 1 east, .and we were engaged in .scrutin-
izing her person with all the coolness and vigor at our command.. She
was; e:icc:eedingly handsome, ·and appeared to us t9 be about nineteen years
ot age, and of' medium height. She wore· a white. robe 0£' soffie-, singular
fabric,. and a 1 ight drab veil wound gracefully about, her head~. The folds
of her dress concealed her feet, but her arms were bare,. and, like her
figure, exquisitely moli.lded.. Her complexion was absolutely transparent.,
and' her hair,. instead of being dark, as, generally represented, was, in:
our opinion,,. auburn, with a golden tinge. She wore no ornaments,, and
after remaining with us for four or five minutes, and making a few ve~ry
commonplace observations;, she re-entered the cabinet without closing
the door.. Here she stood facing us for a few seconds,, when Mrs. Holmes
asked her whether she could disappear before the visitors as. she had
done on pre'Wious occasions. To this interrogatory, she made the same
reply as. she had to the other; and, surprising to relate, gradually
faded away into thin air before us, until not a vestige: of her was to
be seen. Nor was' this all, f'or a few moments subsequently, and outside.
the cabinet, within three or four feet of us, she: began slowly- to form
again, until she stood bef'ore us in all her pei:-fection onc-e more.. After
this, she bade us a kind "good-night," and, re·entering the cabinet, she
disappeared before the door was closed; and the s 1 eanc·e waB'. at an end9-
We were in that cabinet without much delay, you may rest. assured;
out Katie was gonel Not a trace of her was to be found in any direction.
During the s 1eance, both windows were: open, but, as: may be seen in our
illustration, they are on the wrong side of the room to have afforded
her a means of escape-. The mediums informed us that her father, who
was executed for piracy in the days of Charles II, frequently appeared
at the· upper aperture, and that occasionally a beautiful little Indian
girl varied the phenomena. We saw neither of these latter, however,
and it was, perhaps, just as' well, Katie having given us quite enough
to manage: for one night at least; and the more so, as she has permit-
ted herself to be photographed in Philadelphia through nearly all the
stages of' her materialization--from the veriest shadow to the perfect
likeness which we to-day present to our readers, and for the accuracy
of which we C'an vouch fully.
