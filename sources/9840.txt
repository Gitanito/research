  		              		Experience Description   

    On May 2, 2018 at 1:15am I was a victim of an terrible car accident, that was sending me into a coma, and in which I had fractures of cerebellum, cervical vertebrae, liver, cranial trauma, pneumothorax with detachment of the lung. Then I was flown to the hospital. When I arrived into reanimation they told my parents that they didn't know if I would survive. I was dying.

 On 3rd of May, I saw myself standing at the foot end of my bed, with all my family and friends in the hospital room, I called them but they didn't hear me, suddenly I saw myself stretched out on my bed, connected all over, then  I turned my head an there I saw a white light shining. I was looking at this light then I saw several shadows approaching, they happened to be deceased members of my family. I saw myself leaving towards them when suddenly my daddy, who unfortunately isn't of this world anymore, took my arm and told me that this place is not my place, that I still have to experience something on earth. He escorted me to my body, we said good bye and I woke up on the next day.

  At the beginning, I thought that I was dreaming or imagining this scene, so I was talking with my mom about it. It's at that moment that she told me that the doctors had to reanimate me as I was slowly dying.
