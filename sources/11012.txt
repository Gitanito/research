  		              		Experience Description   

    I was a single mother, escaping the shame and confrontation of my parents in my home country. advanced pregnancy, and  on my own, without any family. The friend that I had called to visit her, had abandoned me. Nevertheless, I did know a charitable soul. She made me welcome in her house and with her familiy. She was with me when the labour pains came about one month early. I had had my first child at eighteen years.  It had been difficult as well, but this second time, I had definitely suffered too much. There were too many hours of pain without being able to dilate what is necessary for a normal birth. The pain and anguish were so much that it was decided, to take me into the hospital theatre in the hope of dilating me for a natural birth. I cried in intense pain and fainted between sheets. My friend was there and consoled me. She was even at the side of my bed  in surgery,  between the fainting and and more fainting. She was asking the surgeon if  I shouldn't have a caeserean section? I resisted because I was afraid  of surgery. 

  In a moment of extreme pain, I left my body. I found myself up on the ceiling of the theatre. I saw my body sleeping. I saw my anguished friend calling me while slapping me in the face. She wanted me to react. 

  For me, it was a moment of immense relief because  I didn't feel any pain. The suffering had evaporated, and a feeling of infinite peace enveloped me. I felt like I never wanted to leave this peace that filled me up. I knew that if they wanted to they could raise me up and take me from here whenever they wanted, but something was going on down below. I saw that my friend  was screaming at me, and the nurses were acting as if there was an emergency. Although I didn't speak English, I knew perfectly well what was happening.  They were worried because the oxygen levels were getting very low. They said the baby carried a great risk of lack of oxygen. This hurt me a lot. I loved my little baby, and I wasn't going to let it die. I never thought for even 1 microsecond more that I wasn't coming back.  

   I returned to my body and then  opened my eyes as I breathed in deeply from the the oxygen mask that they had  put on my face. My baby was born and they rushed it immediately to the incubator. It weighed 2.6Kg. It's skin was blue and the oxygen had begun to fail him. When  in the normal ward, my baby cried ceaselessly in the incubator. I asked to comfort him in my bed since I had had a great connection with him. Both of us had suffered and we had been at the point of dying. 

  The following days were as if normal. My boy grew and I never had or felt anything special about the experience. For many years, I never told anyone of my experience and through the years I had become interested in the subject of death. Nine years later, I had a brain aneurism that burst.  I was in  intensive care where I was unconscious for two weeks. I have no memory of where I had been sleeping during this time, but I recovered farly quickly. 60 days later, I discovered I hád a lump in my breast that was diagnosed to be breast cancer. The strange thing is that I was feeling for lumps in my breasts consantly. Without realising it,  there was something in my head that made me constantly look for it,  get urgent medical attention, and to carry out appropriate tests. They decided that it wasn't anything. Nevertheless, this something inside of me said that if it had been anything, they had to discover it. There were two results supposedly negative, but under my continual insistence, when the third test showed that I had been right, I had breast cancer. From then 4 months had passed, and it had advanced to grade two. I firmly believe, that something urged me to have the tests daily until they found the cancer, and then not give in to the surgeons, because my mother died of breast cancer. 

  It's my story – Thank you for giving me the opportunity to say it. I firmly believe that our consciousness never dies, just that we separate ourselves from our body in something we call death. When I was on the ceiling of the theatre, this was me, continuing to be me, that which I saw below was just my body. It wasn't me.
