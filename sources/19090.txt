my name&#39;s John Maynard
I&#39;m a retired military intelligence
analyst I retired in 1980
I was in the military for 21 years I
started out with the Army Intelligence
Security Agency as an analyst went on
from there to work for several different
organizations within that within the
military and ended up with the DIA at
the last of my career and was an
administrator there and in charge of
most of the documents for the
requirements and evaluation division as
far as being aware of what was in the
intelligence world for UFO and
extraterrestrial I guess it was early on
in my career in its early 60s
some of the radio communications that I
was analyzing for the army security
agency were a little bit more than just
the normal type of traffic I think at
that point when I became too curious
when they decided to let me go I went on
from there to investigate on my own
different aspects of what was going on
when I got to Europe I was approached by
a few of the counterintelligence people
there the knew had information on my
background as far as analysis goes and
became involved in what was the drug
traffic to look at and see where people
were moving drugs back and forth as far
as the military was concerned and at the
same time I ran across the UFO problems
that people were having particularly
sightings in Europe and things like that
I did preliminary investigations for
these people in turn reports in what was
you know what people were saying what
was going on that was a worked in
Okinawa and we were analyzing traffic
patterns for the Chinese at a particular
time and every once in a while I would
run across an anomaly that wasn&#39;t really
within the
pattern of the type of traffic that
would be known for setting up networks
within the military compound and when
questioning you know here we&#39;ve got
something brand-new
what is it you know I would always be
pushed off to the side and say well you
don&#39;t need to worry about that things
like that but I just can&#39;t let it go
or never could and I still don&#39;t I
pursue it to the enth degree as far as
you know without getting myself in
trouble but I did that time that I found
out that there was more to these
communications and it was normal and
that they were not basically earthbound
most of the traffic became anomalous is
it one on the further you dug in it the
more you notice that it didn&#39;t belong
with the normal traffic that was being
broadcast
I couldn&#39;t trace any particular origin
and that&#39;s what got me really interested
more this is coming from and knowing a
few friends that worked in the
communications department I thought you
know their guidance in which way it was
going I guess that was my downfall
because they weren&#39;t quite as good
friends as I thought they were and what
did you learn well basically that the
communications really wasn&#39;t coming from
within training itself it was coming
from another location but they would not
really divulge it and I you know one of
my friends just kind of pointed at me
and off the side through his thumb up in
the air and I was that a good sign or
not and he said no and I just left it at
that and we went on then in private very
private talks he admitted it say we&#39;re
not from they were not earthbound
signals we really didn&#39;t have a space
program that was hey you know there
would be moving that kind of traffic nor
did we have the communication systems
and satellites at that particular time
that would you know going I&#39;m talking
about late 50s early 60s okay so that
serves timeframe goes it was you
had to be something else besides just us
I mean amount of satellites that up
there you means putting they can been up
that long and neither had the American
satellites as far as you know using them
I think that was really my downfall as
far as that because they came to the
point a you know realization as it was
not you know basically my head to have
an Astra actress extraterrestrial so
that they found a way to get rid of me
and they did it very well and since we
weren&#39;t police and I was just some other
American coming along with a friend we
would get all kinds of information out
of these people they were more than
willing to speak but when it came to
officials from the government the police
and things like that they just clammed
up tight they were afraid when I was
someone else they would open up and we
get quite a bit of information about the
sightings we get drawings of what the
vehicles look like whether they landed
or not whether they were they saw any
people with them you know
extraterrestrials things like that and
it just made an exciting career for the
next two years while I was over there
who are you making these reports for
during us uh basically they were going
to the CIA some to the DIA
and some to the Air Force says OSI so of
a special intelligence what they were
using the information for I never never
learned well there&#39;s several different
projects I ran across later in my years
in the when I was in Turkey in that
mid-70s
76 77 77 t8 when I left I was an
administrator I worked for NATO land
southeast headquarters I had some very
good Turkish friends went scuba diving
with him some other things and he would
talk about the eastern part of Turkey as
being a great UFO place and I just asked
him point-blank it&#39;s what do you mean a
great UFO place he says well we have
sightings out there all the time never
reported sian queried do with a couple
of my Turkish military friends and you
know finally got one general to actually
admit he&#39;s well yeah it&#39;s a great area
if you want to see UFOs I&#39;ll take you
out there sometime well they send me
back two times but with the same results
but by the third time Colonel Corso was
getting the picture that you know I was
just being a dupe I was being sent there
to you know harass him about this stuff
and he made a comment that was really
funny at that particular point I didn&#39;t
really connect it with anything until
later uses you have no idea at all what
we&#39;re about do you and I told him no sir
I don&#39;t
he says well someday the technology will
be out there that has been totally back
engineered went right over my head at
that particular point but I just told
him yes sir
off I went like a good little private to
wherever I was supposed to go I didn&#39;t
tell anybody but he had told me I just
kept it in my mind and I reported that
Colonel Corso
we just dismissed me from his office and
he just left it at that
now what they were trying to get was
something entirely different I had a
requisition for certain types of
material that Colonel Corsos supposedly
had for write-ups of engineering
projects that happens all the time in
the Pentagon that materials are kept
very tightly by the owner take a look
documents that were ready to be used on
whatever the particular course was
within the documents there was always
stating to extraterrestrial most of them
are still Asif I&#39;d a lot of them pertain
to so once all to the strategic arms
limitation treaties with Russia the
National Intelligence photographic
Center you correct me on that later
whatever and we we get pictures in of a
the supposedly AVM or satellite areas
which pick up the Soviets what they were
for building sites and a once in a while
a an anomaly would show up on the
picture that didn&#39;t belong there
round object a triangular object they
were not markings put on the photograph
to indicate someplace or anything like
that these were above ground they were
not part of the picture so phenomenally
came up and certain photographs and
things that we received in our office at
DIA and we always thought they were
interesting and he came from I&#39;m not
exactly sure the acronym I don&#39;t
remember exactly but it&#39;s n IPC was I
believed was the National Intelligence
photographic Center over on Hay Street
right there in Arlington and we used to
joke about them things like that but you
knew that they were not part of
something that was placed on the
photograph or the imagery to be as an
image like a marker or indications and
things like that there was not a normal
type of object that was used
particularly the
I&#39;ve long ones or the circles or the
triangular ones because they weren&#39;t
triangles kind of funny with a rounded
corner and the tail end of it or
something but these were taken most
generally with the talent keyhole
satellite and they would show yeah they
would show there would be objects within
from the primitive from the TK 11 + TK
12 shots that were taken that show the
anomalies sometimes you could actually
track it photograph or photograph as it
moved across the ground so that you knew
the truth didn&#39;t there wasn&#39;t an object
it would be you know like a marker for
something because it would have stayed
steady at the point or whatever it was
that you knew it moved I did have one a
rather interesting incident not in an
organization organization that I belong
to as far as the DIA was there but it
was an office put within my area so
since it was in my area of realm of
security I received the codename to go
in there and you know look at the office
and it was called Omni because here&#39;s
this brand new project guess what it is
radar satellite and I remember after
that all settled down and everything
else I was talking with one of the
sergeant&#39;s over there and in the little
showroom they had that they had built
through this and they were getting ready
to pack everything up and move to their
own area the I noticed the satellites
positionings I said no this is supposed
to be a system that tracks radar
anomalies on earth right you know the
whole thing the movement yep that&#39;s what
it does this is a wide half of them
pointed towards the outer space towards
the moon towards areas that are just
blank space well I don&#39;t know was the
reply Jesus never thought about it
and says well at least half of those
satellites you got up there aren&#39;t
looking at I said what are they looking
for he says well you got to have me no
no about that I said I see in other
words who&#39;s coming he says we don&#39;t know
about end of subject
well this was the new radar system the
satellite system was put on for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff the so long show
them what technology had now come up to
and how we could track movement around
the earth with these with these
satellites people and the young and
airplanes it ships whatever could be
tracked I just thought it rather on that
they also were tracking stuff in outer
space I did work with the Camp David
Accords and assigning the sr-71 the
Blackbird on mapping the Sinai in that
in there were several little small
reporting&#39;s at that particular time that
the Blackbird had been accompanied by
something that wasn&#39;t from this earth
but what was the biggest interesting
thing you know it&#39;s when the flights
were made and they come down and they
come back with traffic patterns and the
photographs and everything else that
were taken of the Sinai which is
probably one of the most ever complete
composites of photographs ever taken of
the Sinai that there would show
anomalies that were part of the terrain
where part of the people weren&#39;t part of
the atmosphere well and intelligence
compartmentalization is probably the
whole thing there&#39;s a real big misnomer
out here in the civilian world about
classification there are basically three
classifications confidential secret and
top secret and that&#39;s it it doesn&#39;t go
any higher than times they could they
would be call them up and they call
about Umbra and they call about this one
Omni they called about TK Talent keyhole
and other projects like that
what people have to realize that you
know I had Umbra documents that were
only secret not just top secret then it
was not the same you know people when it
comes to kind of you get you into the
background of what intelligence you know
how they how they break things down they
keep pretty much each organization and
island them to itself you don&#39;t have
crossed departmentalization a lot within
within the program&#39;s if I have which is
the most common one known out here today
a number of clearance which people say
lot so high about Topsy grades no it&#39;s
not it&#39;s a compartment strictly a
compartment is not more top-secret as as
high as you go we get ultratop no you
don&#39;t ultra is another compartment has
something entirely different to do and
it basically does with the president so
you can&#39;t cancel learning with it so
that&#39;s it
you have Islands unto yourself each one
does their own particular type of
analysis the one I work and we recall
requirements and evaluations we were the
ones that made a determination to fly
the birds out of Wallops Island or
somewhere else to go up and put a
satellite up DC to the other one I can&#39;t
remember exactly what they were about
because we very seldom name the names of
what they were they would give it to
divisional set up DC to is when we were
dc-3 was a DC for and it was a DC 5 and
I&#39;d have to really dig back into my
background papers to give you the exact
name for each one
that&#39;s how compartmentalized they become
one of them was did strictly analysis
that&#39;s all they did and they would feed
it to us and requirements and but we
didn&#39;t really see all that they did they
didn&#39;t see all the material they did it
just gave us the finished product
and we would look at the finished
product and then make our determinations
what we&#39;re going to do from there that&#39;s
basically the way it is Omni project
which was the radar satellite was an
island unto itself you didn&#39;t have an
omni stamp on your on your badge you
didn&#39;t get into their office period end
of subject
same thing with you know with people
with TK or many other things
Omar o Umbra ultra same ran undone
Elaine NRO
National Reconnaissance Office basically
run by the Air Force the Reconnaissance
Office from my understanding of people
that have had contacts with since I
retired has taken on a lot more
responsibilities particularly towards
UFO and extraterrestrial activities
almost you could say that they picked up
where Blue Book dropped off blue Brook
was basically an Air Force project the
satellite project for themselves it was
really tried to be killed when they
stopped Blue Book and they did some
other things and finally fell under the
purview of the National Reconnaissance
Office and it is basically a joint
service but it&#39;s basically it is run by
the Air Force in the Joint Chiefs staff
they have a very ominous job not too
much is really ever known about exactly
what they do but they&#39;re running the
successor to the sr-71 it should say
supposed to be a delta type aircraft
capable of Los Angeles to London in
about 18 minutes so it goes near space
glow over
that&#39;s pretty quick well satellite
imagery is pretty much gone to the
background you&#39;ve still got talent
keyhole they&#39;ve still got Omni they&#39;ve
got a couple others up there now that
you know I don&#39;t even know the code
names for anymore and but most of the
reconnaissance is done by aircraft or
the antigravity they&#39;ve been working on
it for a long long time I know that
anti-gravity know basically what I&#39;ve
seen is basically the magnetic pulse
engine it has a very unique signature
when it flies it has a normal type fuel
but it also has a magnetic pulse set up
to it and the signature if you&#39;ve heard
it soap-on-a-rope type of contrail
behind it a government is widespread as
everybody knows I mean it&#39;s into
everybody&#39;s pockets and everybody&#39;s life
all over the place and the same thing
holds true for the UFO extraterrestrial
if you want to look at it that way but
very very few people really know the
full knowledge of what&#39;s going on it&#39;s
held very tightly with in black covert
operations if you want to take a good
close look at some of the background on
it you can go to civilian organizations
outside of NASA which are direct
contracts with NASA like Dryden
industries why are they flying all them
now flying the sr-71 and reconnaissance
using Navy pilots what are they looking
at what is NASA looking at you know when
you think about that why are they doing
these particular things they&#39;re not
using ever training that&#39;s for one thing
within the organization with the
executive level I would dare say that
the National Security Adviser when it
comes on board is fairly well treated as
in a know from the top and NSA still
limited because he&#39;s only an appointee
and at that particular point you
appointee at CIA the same way I&#39;ll have
knowledge but very limited knowledge to
be within but some people down within
the black covert areas will have very
specific information about what&#39;s going
on other organizations NRO as we
mentioned National Reconnaissance Office
work in that particular area they picked
up basically all of the stuff from
Project Blue Book how they treat it it&#39;s
a good question
not very much is known about the anti-ro
it&#39;s one of those organizations it&#39;s a
solo profile with actually open
statements in the public when it stated
anytime the question comes up on it
strictly you know and entities it does
reconnaissance in the Air Force period
well why would you no questions come out
but not normal as the normal public
knowledge it leaves a lot of question
but as far as UFO and intelligence and
extraterrestrial goes it&#39;s right at the
top and I would say that the president
has such limited knowledge of it I know
Carter did not have any knowledge
whatsoever and I worked right there with
the organization cart President Carter&#39;s
organization so you know that kid they
keep a pre secret I think any man in a
mistake get Roswell rather than
admitting it they covered it
and they covered it because like my
grandmother told me she says UFO and
extraterrestrial activities been going
on a lot longer in this government world
lout would to admit she says I have
known of incidents in the ninth early
1900s when she was 18 years old about
extraterrestrial and UFO sightings and
stuff like that so you know it&#39;s been
going on a lot longer we&#39;re finding out
that it&#39;s gone on a lot longer than that
now
I thought it was comical the way Bush
Georgia w threw the ball into Cheney&#39;s
Court of anybody who would probably know
more than anybody else would be Cheney
he has some very interesting knowledge I
have talked with people in corporate
entities who don&#39;t Atlantic Research
Corporation one of the big ones not very
often heard about it&#39;s an insider
Beltway a bandit if you want to call it
that very low profile mostly has all of
its work done with intelligence and that
TRW Johnson control Honeywell all of
them at some point or another became
involved with the intelligence field
certain works activities that were
contracted out to them some will fill
course those early vac engineering
projects if you will look into those
Atlantic research was one of them way
back and to these that were created out
of people in the Pentagon to become a
quote-unquote beltway bandit received
projects grants and monies to do certain
projects there was so highly classified
email you know there was only a
top-secret but so part
analyzed that you know only about poor
people would know what was going on so
you know was that tightly controlled you
would have to look at corporations that
were started by people who retired from
the military take Bobby Inman in his
little oversight group out there in
California some other things like that
so you know we would ask a question who
really is controlling JPL you know why
was JPL started other things
corporations that Livermore Ames
Laboratories Fort Detrick some very
interesting things come out of Fort
Detrick and Harry diamond laboratories I
don&#39;t known for a long long time don&#39;t
hear much about them because they&#39;re all
basically military contractors in a
particular specialty somewhere vile some
are high-tech I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve
ever seen any back engineering notes how
they do it stuff like that very unique
you get an engineer to tell you how they
do it and the specific notes that you do
you take it forward from somebody&#39;s
notes and you can build build the item
just from the back engineering notes and
you know got to take it apart to find
out it works I think some stuff was done
out of Roswell yes the crashes and other
crashes that they had in the 50s that
they picked up on out of New Mexico and
out in Texas so in southwest areas there
was a crash up in the Canada in the
mid-50s
kept very very hush-hush there was
definitely some engineering projects
determined from those things there&#39;s a
new project that I picked up on with
this with HAARP that&#39;s being done
through the Navy where they&#39;ve scarfed
up huge amounts of land in western
Nevada near and around Lake Tahoe
there was this scarf up of land quite
mountain down in Arizona that involves
that Very Large Array system that they
using are all connected to HAARP they&#39;re
all work under the electoral fields what
is it elf no they call it connect it up
with the Very Large Array now going in
and Hawaii that you have a triangular
position set up where they can do almost
anything in space they want to but they
can do a lot more to the ionosphere this
planet than again can they realize it
makes you wonder why they&#39;re doing such
things you know what what&#39;s out there
that there have to have such elaborate
protection type activities going on
because that&#39;s basically what they are
an interesting question about weapons in
space it&#39;s not basically known but I
think we can go back to a comment that
was made by yeah one of the astronauts
when he stepped on the moon was the day
after they got there and it was the
original flight and he says you&#39;re right
they&#39;re already here
it got out on the Airways I know several
people who had recorded it but the
remark was very unique because it was
quickly taken out of all other tapes
that was public broadcast when there was
repeats that particular point never
again weapons in space is still a big
enigma black hole bird operations have
always been trying to do something like
that
basically Star Wars as Reagan started it
is a big boondoggle notice if it didn&#39;t
exist it was just all on paper laser
weapons well now that&#39;s a whole
different story
there&#39;s brand-new leaps and bounds been
made in laser field not only cutting but
pulsed laser which basically destroys
anything it hits but down as far as a
hand size not quite yet I think the
closest thing they call it is that
nickname is railgun and
which is done under magnetic pulse very
fast little weapon I&#39;m sure we do that
we have weapons in space there&#39;s
probably no doubt in my mind about it
they were trying to develop on the long
before Star Wars became an entity back
in the late 60s early 70s Nixon wanted
something along that line to produce
weapons for space and it was project
started them not Nixon is per se the
individual themselves but is in his
administration people wanted it done
there was a fear then that something out
there and I was when the first ones came
out about the asteroids impacting the
earth and it really didn&#39;t become a
heavy project or knowledgeable with
people until very recently but
apparently we had some rather close
calls back then
a lot closer and what they call a close
call today so it became a very big
concern
asteroids UFOs people coming from other
places so when Star Wars was brought out
as an idea which was before Reagan
actually been incorporated into his
administration it became pretty much a
window dressing issue when people would
call it but there was a lot of truth
behind what they were trying to do they
knew the basic principle whether they
wanted to do they wanted a weapon system
they could put in space that would stop
a ballistic missile that was the concept
now if that ballistic missile happened
to be coming from another direction
other than earthbound could it do the
same thing or was it a ballistic missile
no concepts were there ideas were there
paranoia was also there within the
government yeah
it&#39;s certain levels you could feel it
you knew it was happening when they tell
the truth about it yeah I doubt it
maybe some year maybe your project will
tell them yeah we&#39;re ready to speak up
people who speak that&#39;s what&#39;s going to
take I guess Britain in the United
States in Canada were the biggest party
to the whole thing they got the engines
off aliens involved in it later on some
of the seto people southeast or treaty
organization people Japan Taiwan
Philippines those people that was pretty
much gone by the wayside now they could
say because they&#39;re reporting in their
mainstream media&#39;s now about UFO
sightings and things like that where it
was kept very health very tightly held
before the media is very one-sided when
it comes to reporting if they&#39;re
Democratic they report the democratic
and slam the Republican after Republican
it&#39;s a vice versa if it&#39;s an independent
they slam them all but you don&#39;t hear
them becoming how can you put it they
don&#39;t step on the other person&#39;s toes
when it comes to things that would be
controversial like UFO extraterrestrial
there&#39;s been too many sightings that
have hit the mainstream but they die
frequently why did they die there was
more interest going on and for the media
to follow up on but they just flat
refused to do it why did they were they
pulled by strings from behind I don&#39;t
know I can&#39;t say and they&#39;re not saying
either so you know it&#39;s difficult goes
right back to the same thing with these
Beltway bandits you know can you get
them to say something no they that&#39;s
where their bread and butter is you know
in the metro step on their own toes push
your dolls in the face whatever and the
truth is they have hidden things like
UFO and extraterrestrial information
from us for years not just the current
era but back before the nineteen
hundred&#39;s so you know it&#39;s that
it&#39;s about time for them to just come
forward and say hey this is it but this
is why we did it just about every one of
them has seen things when they went to
the moon that were in fact one said that
they were there crap on the moon at that
time and this man has disappeared off
the face of the earth I&#39;ve tried to find
him but I have his name I&#39;ve given to
dr. Greer I&#39;m sure he can find him but a
lot of the astronauts are told to keep
it quiet and they&#39;re good Americans too
I mean it comes under the guise of
national security
