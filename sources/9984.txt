  		              		Experience Description   

    I was admitted in the hospital for ulcerations inside the bladder. During the surgery, I could feel that I was coming out of my body, as if I was floating first next to it. I could see all the nurses in the room and they were talking very loudly. All the sounds were amplified, it was as if my conscience was everywhere in the operating room, I could hear and see all the very small and insignificant details, such as the sound of the tools, the noise of the machines, the steps of the people walking, it was a very intense and exhausting atmosphere. Then I had the sensation that I was sucked into another dimension, into a vortex that was spinning anti-clockwise, and I could hear many vocalizations with echo. The vortex was very colorful, bright colors such as red, pink, yellow and blue. The colors were very graphic, a little bit like looking into a kaleidoscope. What I remember is hearing strange sounds, like bells, siren, or chimes. For me this experience was not pleasant, because I could see a bright light at the end of the tunnel and I did not want to go there, I was seing pictures of my husband and I when we met.
