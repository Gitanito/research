  		              		Experience Description   

    I fainted two consecutive times. This experience happened during the  second time I fainted. 

   I found myself into a tunnel of light, which wasn't blinding. It was  yellow, warm, and welcoming. I felt that I was part of this light that was transmitting happiness to me. Within this lighted tunnel, I saw it was extending about 50 to 60 centimeters above myself. Then  I  felt like I was at the end of this tunnel. I felt that beyond the tunnel was my children that I spontaneously aborted yesterday  afternoon. I began running to reach them, but something held me back. It felt like I was being sucked back like in a syringe plunger vacuum. I was  cast into blackness and brought back to my body. 

  I recovered my consciousness and  could hear human voices. Later on, I was told that as I was unconscious my blood pressure reached 180 bpm.  I think that was when I was running into the tunnel. For about two hours, I was left with a feeling of serenity,  well-being and happiness. Even  today, I yearn to go back home and step beyond the tunnel threshold.

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I learned to listen more and to get in touch with the depths of another  

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes.   At first I didn't want to share because I didn't want to be considered crazy.  
  
  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I do not know how my remembrance of the experience compares to my remembrance of other life events.   I have a good memory and my recollection is bright. However the events that brought me to this experience have been more and they have been protracted in time. Consequently, they have more elements to remember.

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          This experience confirmed what sometimes happened to me even before the experience such as dreaming dialogues with the deceased, future visions and suffering before the happening of a tragic event.  
  
  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    After a few days with my closest relatives and later with persons interested into after death experiences. In the former case the reaction was silence. I had the impression they thought I was crazy. In the latter case, I got encouragement by those who were interested in the topic.  
  
  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   I knew they existed, but I had never read anything about it. Consequently, I deem that my experience has not been influenced by that.  
  
  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I knew I had had an experience of another dimension  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I think the experience is real and I pick from those recollections when I feel discouraged. I remember that experience with a sense of homesickness and I wish I could go back to that dimension. This is why I try to connect via Buddhist prayer, meditation, and hands on healing.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I would like to make that experience again, which has been unique and unrepeatable.  
  
Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         None that would come to my mind
