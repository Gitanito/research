name of thole Afpeits the 5 hath to the Planets; as alfo , the
hour of the day or night when they perfectly meet in Afpeft ;
the eighth\olumn hath onaly thole Afpetfs Which h U d'G

For better undemanding the true time when the £

O f the Effefilial! Dignities of the Planets.
1ic cxVt way of judicature in Aflrology is, firft, by being
t perfeA in the nature of the Planers and Signs.
Secondly,by knowing the ilrengrh, fortitude o:debjlility of
ihe Planers, Sigiulicators, and a well poyling of them and their
al'peAs and feverall mixtures, in your judgment.
Thirdly , by rightly applying the influence ofthe-poiiture of
Heaven ereAct! and the Planets afpcAs to one another at the
rime of the Quellion, according to mtimillfand not enforced;
maximes of Art; for by how much you endeavour to ilram a
judgment beyond nature, by fo much die more you augment
Youi Lrrour. . . . .
A Planer is then faid to be really ftrong when he luth many
I fieniial dignities, which are known , by hir being either in
his Houfe , hxalcation , Tripliciry, I u\ne or Pace , at time of

very little of the Gqocjs of this world , or it tels you the man is

npH e afeendant. and y in r s , together with S policed in
X the afeendant, did fignifie the of the Servant, who
was ftiort ofllature, corpulent, of a good complexion, and rud­
dy, frerti countenance; hit fatnefle I conceive from the North
Latitude of y, which was about one degree; as alfo, that the
degrees afeending were in the Termes of d\ in an aycry Signc,
andin the Face or Dccanate of ©, now pofited in a watry S gne,
andin parcill A to both in raoyft S gnes, which argued a
fUgmatick.full body, die.
The Signi,'iC‘!t9r of the Servant was peculiarly inthis Figure,
although many times y (hall fignifie a fugiive Servant: The
Servant was a young Fellow ofabout nineteen, a well fet Fellow,
fhorc.big joynted, broad and full faced, dark brown hair, his
teeth growing ill favourcdly, a San burnt, obfeure complexion,
yet the skin of his bodycleer.
1 obferved that he wen: away from his M iter the Sunday pre­
ceding, pt what time the 'J was in ir, a WMbrn S gne, and
that notv cf, the Signijicafor of the F-Tow was in the fame
Signej as alfo, that y the common Signify:* or ofScrvants, was
in a Wcftern Signc, but South charter of Heaven; it is
true that Ji hath force relation to the South quarter, and to
the North.
i judged from hence, that the Servant went wtftvard at his
firlt departing, and that at the time of the Q© ftion, he was
Wsft fr<|mthe c/wrent's houfc; and this 1 judged,becaufe J was
angular^ andevev way as ft^ong as the otberwayes.I fliould

about Long-acre, or upper part of Drury Une: In regard that 2

Of Thtfi,
IT was the received opinion of Matter Allot ofO x fo rd , a man
excellently verfed in Afirtltgh, that the true Signtficaror of
a 7/Vf/ i»that Planet who is an angle or fecond houfe, and
beholds the feventh houfe: if no peregrine Planet be in an an.
git or the fecond houfe, then the Lord of the feventh (hail be
Sig»irc*tor of the Thitf' if he behold the feventh houfe iother*
wa^t th*r Planes to whom the 2 applies , if he behold the fe­
venth houle ; the rather, if the D icparate from the Lord of
the afeendant. And hefaith further, that a peregrine Planet in
what angle foever, ftiall not be Signifimor of thc77Wif, unlefs
he behold the feventh houfe, or have any dignity in the degree
ofthe feventh: yet if one and the fame Planet be Lord of the
hour and of the afeendant, he ftiall fignifid the Thief, though
he behold not the afeendant; The truth is, I have ever found,
that if a peregrine Planet were in the afeeadant, hewnSigni-
fetter of the Thief: next to the afeendant, I preferred the an­
cle of the South, then the Weft angle, then the fourth houfe,

HE true refolufion of this Quft¡ondepends much
upon a right unfciihnding, what'relation the querent
hath to the party ci qtiircd of, for you have oft read in
tht preceding judgnurtv that in every Qutition great
care is to be take;), that the intentions of the Demandant and
ir^/ed-party may br cvrefully apprehended, that thereby one
¿¿,:,77f.:/o»-benoi nrIt ken for another;, wherefore for better
fati'fiftionof (his part of judgment we now are handling, you
mufttrq »ire whether he. e/e. d\e qvirent, enquireof the death
of aFriend, or of his Wife, or a Father, or a Child, or of a
Servant, #*. Give the fitilhoufe and his Lord for the
Mttr of the querent; but for the party queftted, givethe Sign of
that houie he is figoified by, the Lord thereof and the ^ for

Together with this, confider if the Lord of his ifeehdant of

ner, or ifhebe in the twelfth' in afped of any unfortunate Pla­
net, either by □ or <f, or if the © be unfortunate or affli-

nevolent afpeft of a Fortune,the abfent isthen Tick : but ifhe be

not been, but he will be fudJenly ill, or very fhortly: but if he
[v: going from the 6 of evil Planets, either by body or afpeft,
fothat he be furtly fep.irared from them, or is departing from
Cnmbuifion, it argues the party enquired of hath lately efcaped
a danger or ficknefle, or peri! equivalent; the grcatncfleof the
difafter or infirmity you (hill judge to be according to the quali­
ty of theSignesthe arc in. and manner of afpeft
affl ding, having relation to the lioufe from whence the afpeft*
a,e.
It's confidereble, that you poyfc in your judgment, whether
the S i g n if ia t o r ofthe abfent party bein the fixth, and not join­
ed to the Lord of the fixth, or to any unfortunate Planet aflh&-
inghim, or whether he be in any amicable alpcA with either of
the Fortunes, or if he be ftrong in the S.goe, you muil not then
judgethe man fick, but rather weary or drowfie, or perhaps he
hath let blood of late, &c or taken fame Payfiekfor preventi-
onofa dileafe which he feared.
Ido onelyobfetve, if the ofthe abfent be ft'O'ng,
and fepirated from a Fortunej and in a good houfe, the «bfent
lives; ifhebeaifltfted, or was lately in □ or <f of tlie /»/er-
tsines, he wasperplexed, or fuffertd much mifery, according to
the nature of the houfefrom whence aifli&ed; but 1 judge him
not dead, unleffctogether with that mifehance, the Lord of the

Efore you proceed tá arty particular DireAion of the five
HjUgUiAll places, you ptight generally to confidcr the
ig:h of the Pofitare of heaven, and therein whether the
degree aftending, the Lord of the Ge.niturc > the ó or , or
the light of the time are extreamly aftliAcd, &c. for thofc ar­
gue no long life : it were therefore in v,un to frame long D i-
redioiu upon that Nativity.
However, that which is principally confidsrablc, and ought
if poflibieto be óbttüned , is’, judicioufly to examine the Nati
viiics of the Parents of theChilde, and whether the Signifies-
tersof Children in them arc ftrong yea or not ¡ for as the good-
nctie of fruit depends upon the temperament of the root, fo
alfo Children’, whofe Parent* have unfortunate Signifoa/crj,
do dye upon a. fmall iickneflc , &c. hue fich they arc nor ufu-
aliy attainable, you may proceed according to the Method fol­
lowing :
Full, confidcr the degree amending , which moil properly
hath lignificatiun of Life, whether it be fortunate or not; its
then foi tu.iate when in the termes or fign , or in the ¥ 01 A of
a benevolent Planet; and fo on the contrary unfortunate , when
tither locally an ¡afortune vitiates the degree afeending, orb/
his rj or j 1alpcA j or when many violent fixed Stars of the na­
ture of the Lord of the eight, do atife with the degree amend­
ing , or are w th or neer the Luminary of the time. If accord­
ing to thefe rule* you finde the Afcendant fortunate, the OnUic
may bvep-llhis infancy ; but if affi.Aed , he hardly efcapes his
very infancy.
Secondly, the Lord of the Afcendant is to be cor.fidcrcd, for

yet the wcjkcft bodic*, moil fmalland tooft flckly, are ufually

then it's npt only an argument the Child (hall live, butaifobe

Piifl, if any Planet do occupy the Sign ascending , or which
is ii'.tcjccpred , he (hall be principal! Sigwficator ofM in n crs:
but he lhall alfo participate in the fame fignincation , whatfoevec
Planet lie is, that hath dignity in the pUee o f the Significator o f
Manners.
Secondly, confidcr that Ph net who is the Signifieator, and
hs ' i/pjfrori for if he be a benevolent Planet, orinafpetS
widfftuh, and ft.ong, he denotes laudable or complcat Mao­
ri®, according tc his nature , if he prove a malevolent Planet,
oru itiftfted with the hoftilebesmes o f one, and be impotent
btftdfs, he render* evil! and corrupt Manners, fuch as naturally
that Planet fignifies. If a good Planet by nature be Significant-
or corfigurarcd with good , but exirt weak, he fhews good and
wholefome Manner* in (hew, yet inwardly they are fomevvhac
ob'eure, muddy, or very fttriple : The infertunes potent, argue,
pood prct :y conditions,but ever mixed with a tinrturc ofpoyfon,
cr with the remsines of fome crabbed condition or other, which
I have ever found true.
V affords manners according to the nature of that Plant;
whofe nature he airtimes: and this he doth in a twofold

way.
i When jbyned to any Planet by <f, but if he be joyned to

nee iff in d, and whoi? the moll fortified o: dignified.

inwhofe tffenriall dignity he is placed •

flu continue, you may know by directions j for when the
¿3 6 An Intndnffhn t$ Nativities,' i

then the Native is fllmoil wholly ^participant of his Mmncri,
and (¿all moil raanifell them to the world in his attions; when
the ? varies herTerra or *fpe&, and doth meet with another of

Its the greateft arguments of Stammering that may be, if the

when l; and © are inthe Afeendant or fixt houfe. In any 0*
tlier Signcs, he rather tliews extremity of pain from too fre­
quent deflux of Rhumes into the Jawe : without doubt the pofi-
tion of p in the'Afeendant in any Sign, except vp or is an
afiured argument of great pain in the Teeth ; So alfo when he
isinthe fevemh , for then he is in cTto the Afeendant. I have
conllantly obierved , that where 1; was in the Afeendant in arf
earthlySign f except v>, the Native had weak Teeth and ddlort,
quickly pecifiiing; if he were in an Aery Sign , the Native wa*

uchvexed with Tooth-ach , but feldom drew any Tooth : If he

butofthemfelves'the Teeth rotted without much trouble or pain,

herein yon mull conhder thofe Planets whom 1 fpeufied b(.

tially fortified, they declare a rich and wealthy Wife, well de­
fended, &crif they be malevolent Planets and ill dignified, they
argue the contrary, '
Wherein I muft give you this general caution, v iz that you
confider the quality and birth of the Native, before you raftily
pronounce a noble \Vife, or one well defended, for let usad­
mit 1 have a Beggar* Nativity to calculate, and that he hathU ,

fo qualified,,&.c. But one well defended, asuoto his condition
viz. perhaps (he may be theDaughter of fome Tradefmanor
Farmer , & c. and this unto him and his Bcggcry , is as if
(he Wiri nobly born } confideririg the difference betwixt a
Beggar and a Farmer, and whereas being Signified by U , fhe
ought to be rich, & c. without doubt a Wife fo fignified , flull
have fome pretty Portion from her Parents or Friends, and

better kind of living or fubfifence; forthtArtif muftnotpre*

our former purpofe. •
Generally, the Fortunes, or either of them in the feventli,
efpecially if ltrong, argue a wealthy Wife, and well defended;
malevolent Planets in that houfc denote much trouble, if they
be potent, perhaps the Wife may be rich, but withall ill con­
ditioned.

Efoie I handle this point, I muft give this generall Inftm-
&ion to the younger forme« of A rt, that in judging of the
effe&s depending upon any Direftion , they maturely tonfidcr
the age of the Native, forevents arc to be accommodated unto
the differences of times, and therefore one fhould extreamly de­
ceive himfdf, that upon any llrong Dui&ion of the Afcendanc
or mid-heaven to the A or * or 6 of ? or , fhould pre-
did Marriage unto a Native that is then but three , four or five
yeers of age; how much, Jfay, fhould the Art!ft mifle the mark
if he fliould attribute tharadion to an Infant, of which he (an-
not then be capable; or wbac a madntfle were it to predid to
an aged man the begetciag of a Child, u hen in reafon it felf,
and by reafon of hiscxtreamfeeblencife, no fuch thing can or
may be expe&ed; we muft therefore prognofticate things pof-
fib'e and naturflll, befitting and agreeing untoc very one, ac­
cording to the difference of his yeers, cH- Wemnllalfo in all

cy then any ones particular: wc muft alio cor.fider the R(g on

But now wc come to handle the meaiure of time in Dircdi-
ons, wherein there are at this day three feverall Opinions, yet
not inch as do make any great difference in the matter.
The opinion of Ptolomty hath continued fince his time untill
this Iail: Age without any contradiction; and it was elms: If
you would direft the Afcendanr in any Nativity , you muft per­
form it by the oblique afeentions belonging to the place where
the Birth was: the words of Ttolemry lib. 4. capt. nit: are thefe

feendant in every Nativity is to be dire&ed by the oblique a-
kencions of the Climate; the mid-heaven by the right afeenti­
ons ; the meafure of time is by allowing fo every degree of the
tsFijiwtor one yeer , for every minute thereof fix dayes, c-re. Ju
our Nativity, pig-’yco. the Afcendanc is 6'. r/,vr, the oblique Thcfrflway

You fee hereare twoTables,the

for example:I would know the ¿nil

By Naifoci’j compute, I would
know the meafure of time agreeing

With 11.degrees I enter the for-

So then it** thus* ir 398 14
From three hundred and ninety eight tUyca I fuhduft three
hundred arid fisty five dayes, viz, a whoh: yeer, and adde it to
eleven yeers; fo then the Afcendant comes to the Tenues o f d ,
the Native being twelve yeers of age, thirty three dayes and
fourteerthours.
Afcendant to the c f of c? after nineteen degrees and fifty two
minutes; Nineteen dcgi ecs in the firlt Tablc.give nineteen yeers,
an hundred and one dayes,feventecn hours: fifty two min. in the
fecond Table /give three hundred twenty one dayes,four hours ;
addedjogether, they make nineteen yeers, four hundred twenty
two dayes, twenty one hours.
If I take three hundred fixty five dayes, or one whole yeer
from four hundred twenty two dayes there refts fifty ftven dayes,
twenty one hours.
So then the Native's Afcendant came to the cPof cf , being a-
ged twenty yeers, and fifty feviti dayes, twenty one hours.

Of ANHHall ProfsEli ns , and by what means to finds ont the T r y

PKoffBien and trogrrffm are all one, and are no more then a
tegular or orderly change of the Significattrs according to
theiueicifion of Signet.
Annual! Progrejfm.
PnUEUon is threefold • one Annual!, wherein We give thirty
degrees, or one whole Sign to a folar yeer; as if in any ones
Ccmtu cthere doth afeend the fixt degree of m »from the fixe
degree of 21 to the fixt degree of i£ (hall be the Profc&io.uall

Sign the firit yeer ; in the fecond yecr, the Profctìionall Sign
of the Attendant fball be from the fixt degree of © to the fixe
degree of <
$
\ ; in the third yecr , from the fixt degree of ¿1 to
the fixt degree of nr (hall be the Profeftionall figure of the A*
feendant; and fo ùntili all the twelve Signet are ended, and
then you snuft begin again, for every twelfth yeer the annuali
Profeftions are the fame : where you muft note, that you imift
begin the yeer of Profeftion , at what time the © returnetto
the degree and minute he was in at the Radix, and for this caufc
it is called a Solar yeer : alfo, in every beginning youmoft hare
upon every cufp of ii*houfe the fame degree and minute which
was there in the Radix, the Sign onely varied.
Olfonethlj Proftflionu
In menfurnall Profeflion, we give unto every moheth one
Sign, fo that the Sign of the annuali Profc&ion is the Sign
profedionall of the firft moretti ; the fecond, of the fecond
moneth.and fo in ordtrj.wherefore in that way.we devide the fo*
lar yeer into thirteen equall parts, whereof each is called a Prt-
fiilionatl monttk
Diurnali Prsfeftion,
In diurnali Profe&ions, one Sign is given to two dayes three
hours and fifty four minutes,«*’*. but this is more fcrupulous then
necefiary.
I will ouely proceed to annual! Profe&ions, holding this
opinion, That if one ihould follow the nicenefle of the AncitnU
in every particular, it were impofiible to judge ones Nativity ex-
adly in half a yeeri time.
Some do teach how to make one generali Table of ProfelU-
(tit} which will ferve for all Nativities, as Origavtu pag.766.
Maginus, pag. 52. Prim. Mob. & e. I ever held it beil to framea
particular Table for every Nativity, which is as eafily performed
and more ufefull; This which followcth is the Profc&ionall Table
of our Nativity in p g . 500.

by entring tbt: Table with the yeers of the Native com*,

I would ereft a JVofcdional] Figure for the 25. yeer of the
N uiveV age, I enter 24 yeers compieat, whichl flnde inthe
third column over tbeliead of 1630. fo then pnr Native's en­
trance into his five aM twentieth yeer of age was eheninteenth
of September, 1640 and continued unrill the nineteenth of Sep­

Profedionall figure of the yeer-obferving tbit the Sign of every

retaining the fame degrees and minute* they hid in the Radix.
Having framed your Profedionall figure, you muil dired the
five Hjhgtacall places thereof, and therefore your b%R way will
be to obferve your generall Speculum, and fo draw down your
Dircdions in order as formerly you did in the Radix o f the Na­

But co come neerer to the matter, Profcttions do tmmfeft
what yeers are like to be happy , what unhappy, by the Profc-

Again, Profcttiws do (hew who is the Lord or Governor

he that rules the next fifteen degrees fucccding; where note, you
cannot expert the Direilion of any SignijicAtcr in a Projeftiowll

You muft judge of the effe&s and force of PrefeEUoni, as you
did in the preceding Direaions, confidering what the Signifa

N the firft place confider the Sign attending in the Profctli.
ott. what place it had in the Radix' whether it was one of the
fonr Ancle«, or Succedints, orCadents; whofe Houfe it was»
which o f the Planets is exalted therein, of whof? Triplieity,whe­
ther a good, or evill Planet was therein at the Radix, or if © or
the Ar.tifcion of any Planet was therein }
■ orwh ther a good
or an- infdrtuivate Planer behdd that'S gn , nnd with what
afped; and whether out of a Sign comiruriding or obeying,
or that agrees or difagree* in nature j.or whether inbe a Sign
of long or ih >rt alcen ions j or whether that part, which is
now the cufp of the houfe , is with any of the more noble fixed
Stars; or whether the Degrees ariiing are of thofe we call L.ghr,
Deep, Pitted, D irk, (;ioudy,or Azimene,augmenting or dccrea-
fing Fortune, & c.
For if the Sign of thcTrofeftion, as well in the Nativity as
in this Ptogrcftionall Revolution be free from misfortune, and
the Lord of that Sign Direft in both Figures , .and in a Sign
of his own nature (,whether the Geniture was'no&urnall of
diurnal!) If, I fay,I he be ilrong in any of his owq ejTentiall
dignities, be in a good houfe of heaven , as well in the Radix
as in the Annnall Figure of the Revolution of the 0 , to hit
place in the Radix: it is then a fure argument chat the Native
(hall fuily accompliflvfuch things’ to his own content, as the
Lord of the yeer had Signification of in the Radix; and it iur*
ther intimates, a itrong conllitution of body, (lability of m ndc,
and prontifei in ihe general! that the yea (hall be a fucceslull
one. You may, if you pleafc, together with this judgement, for
the health of the body, confidcr every ycan hefehve things,
■wliwh by experience I have found Very true.

You muft next in order confider the Lord of the yeer who
is ever that Planet that is Lord of the Signe afeending in the

as ufuûlly it will be.fo ; then you mull iimit.urito each hit

l. degr. and 57. Afcend, I would know how many daves o f
that yeer U-who is Lord of that Sign,(hall rule ; I fubdufttf-

I look for 284 m my Table of the dayes of the yeer, I finds

Lords of the yeer, fu rnuit you have confideration to both Pla­

. •lf the r ° rd o i the Yeer was in the Radix ftrong, but weak U dm ent s

ot the Native will be but weak , and his Adions according to

If in the Radix the Lord of the yeer was unfortunate and im-

Thi* year the afeen-
dant comesto the terms
of $ in November, and
S to the terme* of U,
both falutiferous Dire-
reftions as concerning
Health, fo alfo in point
ofHonour, Reputation
and the Affaires of the
world; they induce the
Native to Wanton
thought*, and offer op;
portunity; & although
b to the cb o f S may
denote fome ftackncffc
. . and failings in Ser­
vants, and private conceit* with fome men of better qualitic,
yettheoccnrfeofU tothe 's of:, and immediately after
the M. c »to a v of 9 hi January do cotnplcat the defires of
our Native concerning fomeJourney Weftvtord, and proraife
himvery much Honour, Wealth and Ettiomion by means of
afecood Marriage, ifhe now want a Wife: the Directions do
alfo advifethe Native to traffick in fuch things, and in fuch
Commodities or men, as are Vtntriall; they introduce to our
Native fome publick office jn the Common-wealth, with large
enacafe of his Patrimony; as alfo, the betaking of himfelfto
fome new houfe, and curioufiy furnifhing the fame with fit or­
naments, dec. the © to the CA of S, may import fome al'per-
lions, and engage oor Native in a Law fuit with amm or men
ofc.ilJarfulcorporaiure, and for /If^rriV/Crmmodities; or it
may argue difagrcement with Neighbors or Kindred,about the
yvivesPortio;),for fome week«,but the force of the benevolent
Direaions preceding,and now the ufeendant its fub/equent, S
to the ©, doth to our Nativ's great content, for matterl of
Portion, conclude all; for tbcl*ttafpc& isin X , and in the

Soa The Tffctfs ef fitreffitns*
fecond of out Native'« M i x , which doth alfo augment our
Native*« private Fortune by hi* own induftry, and in hisown
way of Trade and Commerce: A i,C . to the Terms of It gives
another tub to the Native, by means of a S*t»r»i*e man; and
fame little time protra&s hit occafions, untill in Afardt the 0
3
hath occdi fe to the cufp of the eleventh hoofc, and alfo to the
Termet of U i n a n d the afeendant to a X of £andQ. of
¿‘ inMareb 16 53.which iu my judgment feemsto be eithet the
very time, or near the confummation of Manage, if a Wife be
wanting; and certainly thefc Dire&ions are not vain, or will
have little effeA*, they do undoubtedly deftgn this yeer 37 to
be a \ear of extraordinary advancement, by the Natives own
i jduftry, or by meant of a Marriage, if not formerly contam­
inated, and of new and honour&blefrieads in the Courts of
Princes: 'i foilowes the precedent aufpirious Directions with
his A to d , inducing the Native to perfcA fome Reckonings,
and caft over his Accompts, and beftirre himfelfin the world,
it augments his credit in the place hclivet in; burthen in /tpU
1653. U tothe cf of <?, and the afeendant to the □ of the
'/, do denote, our Native fliall receive fome damage by
na/caen in histrolling of them, they becomming 'Bri»{r»ptJ;
and tbathc Hull have fome jarringwith his Wife, and with
other Women alfo yand it alfo threatens danger in Bthte by
Women, and by entrufting Lttt/ar men.perhaps tame finall di-
fjiter at Sea; our Native may endanger his health, and get a
feayet by fuifct, oiurude raw Fruits,or a furfet of cold, as the
afeendant in C to l- in -H; the in n , being Prmitrtr and
prfncd in the fifth of the Radix; this Sickncfle may therefore
come by drinking He alths, or overcharging the StOimck, of
which the Native mull take care, and purge Flegm cfpccially.
