  		              		Experience Description   

  I was in a room.  I became fully aware of being around the birthing scene with two wise and caring entities by my sides who were just behind me. I watched it all happening. The entities asked me, 'What do you want to do?' I replied, 'I want to come, and to make it.' So they fixed the infant body so I could continue to be born. 
  
  I was 'whooshed' back into the baby’s body.  I had about 10 seconds more of complete awareness. I remember the medical staff was rushing me down a corridor. I was either upside down and seeing black squares on the floor, or I was right side up and saw the square lights in the ceiling. Someone was carrying me. I saw I was wearing white clothes. This memory stays with me and is as clear as it just happened.  

  I was adopted as an infant.  As a small child, I repeatedly would ask my adoptive family and anyone else I came in contact with, 'What happened to the baby?' They didn't realize that I was talking about myself.  Nobody knew what I was talking about, so I never got an answer.  Eventually, I stopped asking them.  

  Two days ago, I was having such pain that someone suggested trying medicinal Cannabis.  I smoked some marijuana, but with the drugs I had already taken for pain the pain, I did had a 'trip' initially. I came to be on the edge of life and death.

  I was with my wife, and she held me.  I told her, 'Please don’t let me sleep, as I won’t come back.'  I revisited my birth.  I knew that with the knowledge of the universe, I was able to answer the big questions I had about the birth and my life.

  I was in a very dark, vast auditorium. The roof had bright stars with lighted tails, like comets. I could see the loved ones who had passed. I could see myself and everything at every angle.  Yet, I was still able to talk to my wife about what I could see.  I also told her that I would come back, but 'please don’t let me sleep.' I told her to keep touching me and I kept drinking water. But there was only about 10 percent of me that was in my body and earth bound. 

  I was able to shift pain from being abandoned at birth, that I had not been able to do before this time.  I could now be at peace about my broken body and know that I had a choice.  I knew I chose this body and was now reminded of that at a deeper loving level.

  Everything there was pure love, pain-free, perfect, and of great design and meaning. I could see with great clarity about the energy that creates, how it does it, and how very dense it is to be in the physical. I could see the veil of amnesia that we pass through, so we forget all we knew from that side and see the physical as all there is.  This is so we evolve, create, and fulfill the desire of source to know itself. 

  I was in this state for 4 earthly hours, but it seemed like 10 minutes over there. 

  By revisiting the birth, I have deeper knowing and reassurance that all is well.  

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 01/06/1965  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Childbirth.       Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function).   I was born after a very difficult pregnancy induction. They used forceps on my head, which was twisted in such a way that my neck was broken. My C2 vertebrae is broken in three places. It’s called a hangman’s fracture, which for most people, it means this is fatal. It is a miracle that I’m alive after this injury.  My birth mother was shackled to the bed and drugged to prevent her from interacting with me. I have the records from the hospital. I was born dead. I had no reflexes. I still have deep furrows in my skull. There is a bubble of spinal fluid that keeps me alive. This has never before seen by medical professionals.  
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Neither pleasant NOR distressing  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  Not with my birth, but from the recent experience. I was talking, seeing, and interacting with my wife in our home; and watching the time on the tv screen in our lounge.  I was passing in information to my wife from her Dad who had died recently.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   There was no judgment as I was trying to understand like normal. I knew everything and had access to infinite intelligence. I could see everything happening from multiple angles.
  
  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         I was at the highest level of consciousness while I was watching the baby at my birth. Then during the experience that happened two days ago, I was in  multiple realms at once. I was much more alive, knowledgeable, and potent than when I am at my best in the physical realm.  
  
Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     As I described I could see the tv clock. And there were 4 hours of earth time that seemed like ten minutes of so. I think if I were not deliberately holding in firmly to life here and my family and surroundings, I would have experience timelessness.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       During my birth, I had no real consciousness, but I do  have clear and real vision of the scene. During the second experience,  I had vision like I had a multiple screen hologram of everything from all angles all at once.  
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      My hearing was much the same because I was more aware of knowledge just downloading into my mind rather than being told to me. Nobody spoke to me.  
  
Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain     I felt like I was in a vast black auditorium rather than a tunnel. I was aware of pain and suffering at my feet.. and when I looked down I was full of rage for a few seconds, but I didn’t want to go there.. I wanted to look at the love and intoxicating beauty above me.   At my birth, it was dark behind me, and light around me and the 2 guides.  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes     My wife’s Dad for sure, and my past relatives at a distance away, very joyous and engaged in their activities.  

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   Light energy I have never seen here in earth.  

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     It was as if the realms were all are here in this one space, but they were of  different vibrations. It is like tuning the radio to a particular station to be able to hear the channel. It was as if I could span different realms at once. I was in the physical, but also in 2 or 3 other 'stations' at the same time.  Each place was vibrationally higher in frequency than the heavy earth one. That place is very light,  fast moving, and timeless.  
  
  What emotions did you feel during the experience?        In the recent experience, I felt elation, enthusiasm, and  fear that I was dying when I didn’t want to. This is ironic since I often think of suicide to relieve myself of bodily pain,  but given the choice, I was very keen to stay.   At my birth, I was super keen to stay and to continue with the plan.  
  
Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe.     Yes, all is well. There is great love here for everyone. Nobody is alone and nothing is going wrong. There is only appreciation.  
  
  Did scenes from your past come back to you?         I remembered many past events.     The major part of the experience was returning to the birth event  
  
Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life.   I knew I wanted to return and that I was given a choice to live or return home. I wanted to stay and had to keep reaffirming that to myself.  
  
God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Unaffiliated- Nothing in particular- Religious unaffiliated.   I was being born and had no particular physically-based knowing  
  
Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     Spiritual beliefs have been confirmed.  

What is your religion now?         Other faiths- New age   Spiritual. I follow Abraham Hicks, Sadghuru and Elkhart Tolle  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I know all I had come to learn was true but that I had only just scratched the surface of all knowing.  I am content that I am not supposed  to understand everything while in physical.  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     To take better care of this body.  

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   The beings didn’t really speak with voices to me. But they gave me knowledge telepathically.  
  
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

  During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     I now know the answer to all my questions about my birth,  about life, my purpose,  how it is designed, and what are the fundamental truths of existence. It isn’t possible to describe in words.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     Without a doubt  we are all connected.
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     There is a source of this intelligence and energy, but I did not directly come in connect with it. I knew this  during both experiences.  
  
Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

  During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   We have no purpose  other than to experience and respond or learn to respond more as Source sees it than from a painful resistant state of consciousness.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     All is energy, and all is one.  Paradox is truth and polarity is the nature of the physical realm, which is designed so source can look back on itself to know itself. As above, so below. We, too, create our reality to look back in ourselves and know ourselves.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.          Absolutely no question there is life after death.  
  
  Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     Along each plane of polarity that is  infinite and makes up the physical existence platform, there are tiny cracks. It is as if  light is both a wave and matter at the same time. In these cracks  lower energy forms exist that come from previous generations. These energy forms  can influence us on a  subconscious level.  There is group trauma that is healing from one generation to the next.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes.     Polarity and contrast is necessary for evolution, but suffering is not. Appreciation,  love, and self-love is true. Hardships provide perspective.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     Love is all there  is, and that absence of love is caused by  individual's resistance from their  thoughts.  
  
  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     I have a great deal more compassion and care for myself. I have always cared for others, but not myself. This has been a huge change.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I’m much gentler on myself and others.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   There are no words!  

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  These experiences never fade or change like other memories.    

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       No       

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        I was able to revisit my first experience and resolve issues that have been hurting me for my whole life.  
  
  Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    For the first one, I had to learn to speak to be able to articulate it. During the second one, I was reporting it all in 'real-time' to my wife. The phrase 'real-time' seems so crazy, because time is irrelevant in those realms. 
  
  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     Yes   I have been interested in NDE for a long time  due to my birth experience.  
  
  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real.     Real, real, real. There is no question it was real.
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real.     Real.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       I feel like I would like to stay there in that place of love,  comfort and knowing.  I try to  relive that feeling, because I believe it is true. My emotional pain here is constructed by my fear-brain and  my physical body pain  is always here. It is my choice to experience life with that.
