I came home from work on Saturday, December 29 to find that her legs were all swollen. I told her that she needed to go to the hospital, but she said that she did not want to go. She said she just wanted to lie down, so I put her in bed. It was about nine o'clock at night. I lay down beside her and went to sleep. When I woke up at around four in the morning to check on her, I saw that she was not breathing. I went into a state of panic and tried to give her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but it was too late. I called 911 and then passed out.

While passed out, I found myself flying into puffy clouds that were in a vividly blue sky, and then I was at the ocean near high cliffs.  I also remember feeling complete bliss. I did not have to worry about anything anymore! Then all of a sudden, I felt like I was being pushed back into my body. I started hearing the 911 operator yelling, ‘Sir, are you all right? Sir, are you all right?’ That's when I woke up. My heart started racing because the reality of what had just happened to my wife came crashing back.
