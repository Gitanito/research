  		              		Experience Description   

    All of a sudden, I was in a fantastic city. The city was  beautiful with buildings of glass. The main part of was  skyscrapers that  were real objects of art. Around me was a strong light which didn't tired my eyes. I was wearing a white tunic. A  tall man was walking beside me. He was thin and was also wearing a white tunic. He was explaining  everything to me about this beautiful city. I don't remember anything about it, nor what he said to me, but I remember listening to him with much interest and feeling surprised by what he told me. The most important and unforgetable thing was the way I felt. I was so happy! I felt so fulfilled that I wanted to stay there forever.  But I heard a voice calling me. I turn around thinking, 'Who's hassling me?'  I saw total blackness. 

Then in the same moment, I woke up in the recovery ward not remembering anything about who I am or where I am. I remember feeling very poorly and anxious because I wanted to return to this paradise. I deeply love my family, but that didn't matter. I didn't ever want to return to this world.   					  

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 28/04/2011  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Surgery-related.       Life threatening event, but not clinical death. I was undergoing surgery that took many hours. The surgeon had earlier explained to me, that it was a risk to my life, but due to my age the possibility of surviving the surgery was great. There were surgery complications of which he had not informed me.  
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Both pleasant AND distressing  

Did you feel separated from your body?      No    I lost awareness of my body  

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I was conscious of my connection with pure love, and I felt wrapped in an energy which is my home. Nothing that surrounded me could damage me.  I didn't feel the weight of my physical body and it was so light I could fly.  
  
At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         At the beginning just having arrived at this place.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     I was there in a second, and in a second I was here. Because of this, I think I lost all sense of time.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I have magna myopia but not in that moment. I could see perfectly and the colours were more vivid, although everything was white.  
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I think we communicated telepathically, except when I heard my name. I heard it behind me and it was very loud. I wanted to ignore it but couldn't.  
  
Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No       

Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   The light around me was fantastic.  

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     It was a city of light and glass. I say this because there were streets and skyscrapers made of glass, ending in a point. They had no windows or doors. The streets have no sidewalks.  
  
  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         I felt fullness as I have never felt in this life. There was nothing negative.  
  
Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe.     This state of fullness seems to be to do with a total harmony with everyone.  
  
Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Catholic   I never practiced, nor do I practice roman catholicism, just from family legacy.  
  
Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

  What is your religion now?         Christian- Other Christian.   I believe in God, Jesus and the virgin, but I am not catholic.  
  
  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     Everything that I believe before has been corroborated, but the thing that has changed is that I had no idea how beautiful it was over there because only by living it can you know. It is not possible to convey it with words.  
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I know what waits for me afterwards, so this gives me spiritual strength  to continue and be more accepting of the hardships of life.  I know that I have chosen all of it so I could learn. I am part of a pefect whole.  
  
  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   It accompanied me but I don't remember it's face.  
  
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I had never experienced the oneness with everything before.  
  
During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

  During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   Everything we go through is to learn and when you have finished learning you can advance. Sometime I will return to this place, plane, level or whatever way you want to call it, but this will happen when I finish my learning in this world.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     I have the certainty that everything that we live here has a purpose that we decided before. I was there and I knew why I was there and why I am  here. Despite the surprise, everything was clear and natural.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.          After this experience I have the certainty that life continues in other planes, although I have always believed this anyway.  
  
  Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes,     you have to live this life the best you can but also have  compassionate towards others and with yourself. I was a very guilty person, and I could go back to this but, after this experience because they received me with so much love, I believe then that I was much better than I had previously believed.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     the suffering passes, because after leaving this world I became free from much that traps me in this plane. If I was able to remain there,  I know that my suffering would have dissapeared.  
  
  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     I felt pure love that I have never experienced on this plane. I couldn't compare this with anything because it wasn't a Being specifically, as if it were my son. It was just that from everything it goes to everything else.  
  
  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Moderate changes in my life.     The change was gradual, but now after the passing of years, I am able to say that I have changed a little. I try to not judge people as much. I feel less fear and  less need for material things. Now, the change I am going through is to enjoy much more the simple things in life and not live so fast.  
  
  Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes After many years of marriage, I separated. This was something unthought of for me. I think that during these years I have been changing slowly, and especially because my desire to enjoy life more fully became stronger. I chose to separate before suffering, guilt and sacrifice grabbed me more. What I have to recognise is that I was very lonely while all the time  I am and have more.  
  
After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   That which I felt was almost impossible to explain in words is  not sufficient.  

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  It is unforgettable because I remember every detail regardless of the passing of time.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I knew  that I could count on my family when I recovered from the surgery but I don't know how long afterwards. It surprised them and they asked me in an earlier surgery, if I had been through anything similar. So I told another person about it. When the subject comes up, I only tell people I can trust.  

  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   Reading about spiritual themes interests me, so I read a book. I don't remember the title. What I rememeber is that the light doesn't tire your eyes, I understand it and also comprehend that others too don't want to return to Earth.

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I am sure it was real but when I went through it, it was like something natural in spite of being something extraordinary. Today, I decided to share it with you but to honest I dont have much awareness of it because it is so unusual. I didn't know it was called a NDE and I don't know if this experience is one. I just know that it was real.  

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I don't know why I went through it and others didn't. Sometimes I think that sometimes I had heart failure during surgery and they didn't tell me. But I don't know if it is obligatory to tell a patient of something like this. If I know that the surgery went on for several hours, and that in total I was sleeping from 10am to 4pm. So maybe something happened with my body that allowed my spirit to leave. But I don't know if this is possible but my heart didn't stop due to this and because of this I dont consider it a Near Death Experience.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I would like to return to this spiritual state. However, I know that I have  much  work to do in this material plane. So much Happiness waits for me when I pass on.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         It would be interesting to ask people if they believe it is possible that the experience could be repeated and also if they know why they went through it.
