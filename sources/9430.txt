We were talking and laughing, when a piece of biscuit was caught in my throat. I couldn't breathe. 

There was no pain, but I was scared not being to breathe. I remember gasping for air, and then everything went grey. I saw a light grey everywhere. It was slowly getting darker, and darker, going from the grey to almost black. I heard a voice, or a muffled sound I thought was a voice that said, 'We are not ready. Not yet.' At that point, it started getting lighter and lighter, and I woke up with my husband sitting in front of me with tears in his eyes. 

His mother was behind me pounding on my back. I gasped for a breath of air, and yelled at her to stop. I then said to my mother-in-law and husband, 'It doesn't hurt. Dying doesn't hurt.' They both backed away from me, and had looks in their eyes as if they didn't understand what I was saying. We never spoke about it again. I have never told anyone about my experience, only because I don't think they would believe me. I am not afraid.

When I started to go towards the grey, I felt like I had no more problems. So peaceful, and quiet, like if I spoke I would be heard.

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No
