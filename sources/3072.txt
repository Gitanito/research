for his religious principles,

difficult to continue at home with any
satisfactory degree of usefulness, and
his family increasing, after a few years
he determined to emigrate to America,
where he was encouraged to hope for \
a greater liberty of conscience, as well
as the prospect of being employed in
extending the Redeemer's kingdom in
that new world. He arrived at Phila-

There appeared, in his apprehension,

of the Gospel, could a sufiicient num-

great a harvest. A learned ministry,
he well knew, was necessary to the

oppressed, and that her petitions to the
sovereign of tl1e mother country were
constitutional, loyal, moderate, and rea-
sonable; that the treatment
they re-
ceived was irrational, tyrannical and in-
tolerable. As he made it a rule, how-
ever, never to carry politics into the
pulpit, he had no
way to manifest his
zeal for the public measures, but by his
private prayers, and by his decided
opinions delivered in private conver-
sations. But, in this way, his senti-
ments became universally known, and
he was considered as a warm friend to
the American cause.
Notwithstanding
these political opinions, he was not
blind to the errors of his countrymen,

aid, and that it was out of his power to
attend him. He feared that at his ad-

nature sufficient to overcome so severe
a shock, and that his symptoms scarce-

The good old man received this news
with his usual submission to the divine
will ;
for as he had always considered
himself as bound for eternity, he had
endeavored so to live, that, when the
summons should come, he would have
nothing to do but to die. He calmly
replied,

was of sound orthodox principles. He
professed himself a moderate Calvinist.
The doctrines of man's depravity ;
the
atonement of the Saviour ;
the absolute
necessity of the all-powerful influence
of the Spirit of God, to renew the heart
and subdue the will—all in perfect con-
sistence with the free agency of the
sinner, were among the leading articles
of his faith. These doctrines, indeed,
were generally interwoven in his pub-
lic discourses, whatever might be the
particular subject discussed. His suc-
cess was often answerable to his exer-
tions. His people loved him as a fa-
ther—revered him as the pastor and
bishop of their souls—obeyed him as
their instructor, and delighted in his
