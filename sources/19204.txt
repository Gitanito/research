well i was uh
one of four children and my father was
attached to anacostia naval air station
in washington dc
and i was born in 43 and
he was at the anacostia naval air
station on july of 52. i remember this
later because
of a lot of reports and when i was a
young kid with my brothers and sisters
on this one particular night it was in
the summer and it was very clear night
there were any clouds in the sky there
wasn&#39;t any lightning or anything like
that and
we lived fairly close to the potomac
river and these lights came up the river
they were like sparklers there were
giant ones there were amber ones there
were kind of a bluish color and white
color and they floated over the trees
very quietly some of them moving slow
some moving fast kind of like soap
bubbles but they weren&#39;t moving
according to the wind or anything there
weren&#39;t balloons that were lighted or
anything like that
and this went on for about a half an
hour
and then
we heard
some kind of a horn and then all of a
sudden saber jets
were coming up the potomac river chasing
these things and they&#39;d go some of them
went straight up and out of sight
and then some of them just went you know
they they just left and i was out in the
yard we had a kitchen garden in the
backyard
and we had a star planter with roses in
it and i was always in those days you
had to push your lawn mower and sharpen
the blades a sears lawnmower because you
didn&#39;t have gasoline lawnmowers then and
i was out actually mowing the yard
and trimming at the time
and um i saw these things and i ran
inside and got my brothers and sisters
to come running out my grandmother was
loving us at the time living with us at
the time and my father was on air
station duty down at the anacostia naval
air station
and i&#39;ll never forget this long as i
lived and the thing that reminded me of
this mostly was when i saw the movie
close encounters
the hair kind of stood up on the back of
my neck because those little
those little light balls that came
through the the toll gates on the
freeway reminded me exactly of what what
i saw when i was a little kid i alluded
to these later
with dr jesse marcel jr whom i contacted
because
he was about the same age maybe a little
older when he saw the the park pieces
his father brought home in the back of
the car
and
we&#39;ve conversed on that quite a bit
since then
these objects
tied in with in later years when i began
to read about the famous flyover in 1952
in washington d.c
and i put two and two together and i was
there and saw those at that time
from newspaper articles in the
washington post new york times at that
time life magazine had articles on that
and i think they even had some pictures
and uh when i was studying later in
college i tried to look up some of this
stuff and couldn&#39;t find it but i have
some copies of some of these magazines
and articles from my father-in-law that
kept just about everything in his boxes
when i after i enlisted i went through
classification in norfolk virginia and
they sent me to the aircraft carrier uss
franklin d roosevelt
i spent time in boot camp up in great
lakes michigan
and i had spent a total of six and a
half years in the united states navy
and i was honorably discharged in 1967
and i was a petty officer at the time
when i when it first went into the
service i picked up the uss roosevelt in
1962 in palermo sicily
she was at anchor in palermo sicily
and i came on board as a radar operator
i was trained in oi division which is
operations intelligence division
but it took me a year to get my
classified clearance to work on
a
certain radar and electronic
countermeasure equipment i was trained
in newport rhode island
uh when the ship were put into bayou new
jersey for some
new equipment to come on board
the roosevelt was used as an
experimental ship for installation of
new electronic equipment new types of
radar electronic counter measure
you name it and also we had some other
new type of aircraft come on board the
rosie
my crew&#39;s book is from 1962 to 1963
and i had
no
prior knowledge of anything about ufos
following the roosevelt or anything else
when i first came on board i was 19 at
the time when i boarded the rosie
and i spent half
my first med cruise on board and all of
the second med crews i extended as a
matter of fact my active duty service
several months so i could come back with
the ship my second med cruise
and uh when i went up to ocs and newport
rhode island they trained us on
state-of-the-art radar equipment the
russians were playing war games of their
own
uh they would kind of harass the fleet
and they would try flyovers the saratoga
was fly over to explain that russian
bear aircraft very fast very high flying
turbo aircraft they got like eight props
on them
and they would do flyovers and they
would monitor our electronic emissions
to try to figure out what kind of
electronic warfare they could do and i
had detected in fact i got accommodation
for for detecting a russian bear
uh aircraft from commander gibson at
that time
and so we were particularly on watch for
this my job was to be able to challenge
i knew what commercial aircraft were i
could check their is it friend or foe
signals or stuff like that i knew about
the tactics the soviets used military
aircraft would soviet military aircraft
would get into commercial air corridors
and try to be masked by the iff squawk
from the back of commercial aircraft you
know i was on midwatch
uh
during
my second med cruise
and uh
it was about
oh sometime between midnight and two
o&#39;clock
and i had a contact come on the radar
scope this new radar that we had we had
a spa 50-inch repeater we used to have
spa eights and a vg a vector guide that
we plot aircraft on
and i i could i knew the difference
between
surface search radar and air search
radar there&#39;s differences in polarity of
the radio signal and things like this
and how the waves come back all the
stealth kind of stuff you know active
and passive electronic countermeasures
so i know the difference between
a flock of geese or you know wave
returns or
false echoes
even
we could generate false signals part of
my job was to generate false signals to
midshipmen that would come on board to
roosevelt for training on radar
equipment to see if they could tell the
difference between an internally false
signal that&#39;s generated and a real
signal on a radar scope and in fact this
was the first thing that challenged me
to check it out in ecm as to whether or
not the contact that i had on the scope
was genuine
because this was between
65 000 feet and above
and the strength of the signal was as
strong as a surface contact
on the water of an aircraft carrier this
this contact was huge
it was
got my attention and the attention of
others that were on the watch there were
four enlisted on watching two officers
at the time that this occurred
we challenged it and checked the um the
codes out it was not commercial and then
it began to move
uh fairly slowly at first and then very
quickly
it was doing better than
a thousand knots the first the first
time i picked it up it was hovering
stationary then it was doing about a
thousand knots
then uh we contacted it was uh
over 500 miles away and that high up
even though horizon line is at 18 miles
on the earth
when you have that high in altitude you
can detect
uh aerial contacts at a much greater
distance than a line of sight or uhf
let&#39;s say communications
and so anyway in this particular case
it was showing up on height finding
equipment and it was showing up on radar
equipment
um
the
co came in and he wanted to know what
the heck was going on here and they
looked at it and asked what the hell was
that you know and it got the attention
of the captain at that time was captain
clark was my captain my commander was
commander gibson at the time
and um
there were only one person on watching
ecm and before i knew in a matter of oh
15 minutes the ship was being turned
and two phantom twos uh were being
prepared for launch
now i got on a set of headphones and i&#39;m
on a spa eight repeater now and i&#39;m
listening to communications between the
pilots and
the co flight ops
and uh when you go to general quarters
uh you do the same thing and i was used
to doing this because one of my jobs
during general quarters was to sit right
next to the commander of our division
and to listen to the cap aircraft and my
job was to log in all the tally hoes and
everything my job was as recognition
expert also to be able to identify
different types of
navy ships foreign ships commercial
ships maritime ships and aircraft
not only
electronically but visually be familiar
with electronic fingerprints
in any event
the
phantom 2s went to afterburners
and
they were about 100 miles or so away
from this contact and turned on the
conical scan radar to lock on and it
winked out
just disappeared
i could see the two phantom twos on my
scope
and this thing winked out
they flew around for about 10 minutes
and then they headed back to the ship
i understand this is normally they spot
aircraft on the deck but they always
keep
the side ramp you can launch from three
catapults on the roosevelt you can want
the two forward catapults were at this
time were
occupied with aircraft spotted on the
deck and they launched these phantom
twos off the angled catapult
and then they recovered them
and after they recovered them all about
35 minutes later after they land on the
pipe 35 minutes later
and everybody settled down this thing
links back on again and it&#39;s about 12 to
15 miles from the ship hovering at about
30 000 feet it&#39;s clear night stars are
out
and lookouts i can talk to them on my my
headphones here everybody&#39;s connected
your your air plotter your surface
plotter
your
officer your
flag plot the uh
captain or whoever the officer the watch
is up in the conning tower and on an
aircraft carrier this is very serious
business because you know it&#39;s
it&#39;s uh you have a lot of people
involved and a lot of safety factors
involved and so it&#39;s not
a normal thing just to fire things up
that quick
and
in any event they went out and the
lookouts couldn&#39;t see anything nobody
could see anything but it was there on
our radar scope
it was not a false signal i never never
saw anything
i never left mine but all i could hear
were the reports coming over my
headphones
and then
the thing that really startled me the
most were was that um
after i got a break we get uh you know
they&#39;re pretty pretty diligent about
this in the navy even today is that
you&#39;d get breaks at least a 10-minute
break in every hour of watch because
they want to keep you fine-tuned
and so i went down the um the corridor
and for this time i first for the first
time i saw two armed marines there
two marines there the one that usually
stands with the captain and they&#39;re
outside ecm and they wouldn&#39;t let me in
there and i had a clearance to be in
there
and then i saw other officers there who
might never even seen before so
something
something went down
something went down now the next morning
a lot of the airedales were down there
talking about
you know the
weird operation that night what had
happened and of course i couldn&#39;t say
anything i didn&#39;t say anything because i
was told by my ceo that and uh you know
i was reminded of this when i saw the
movie red october
and the admirer walks up and shows
somebody at conventionals and say this
never happened and my seal told me
jordan this you know what have you got
in your vlog this never happened
and i wasn&#39;t the only one there on watch
that night so anybody who
who was there at that time knows knows
what i&#39;m talking about and knows that
it&#39;s the truth
but
less than a dozen people knew what went
on that night and that ship had five
thousand men on it
then after that particular med cruise
a few of us started talking about it and
i later
ran into a navy chief at the school up
in ocs who told me a story about when he
was down in the caribbean
and they had a gq and they were on
operational readiness inspection with
the ships and they saw this
large ufo come up out of the water
and take off
and he said that the movie the abyss was
based on that particular story and that
was part of navy records um i&#39;ve since
contacted many of my shipmates because
of everything that&#39;s been going on with
ufos lately
and
which brings up some other subjects but
which i&#39;ll get into in a minute but i
have been in touch with mr chet
krazynski who
had been a tremendous help and had
sent me some of the papers that i saw
when i had first got my clearance about
reporting ufos and things like this it
was called gen app it was standing
orders of the day if you
had detected anything how to report it
it was primarily for radio operators so
that&#39;s navy intel okay
and uh
i
was flag plotter uh when and when the
admin would come on board for sixth
fleet and use it as his flagship or some
other co
in charge of it and so uh i don&#39;t take
you know
claims about ufos very lightly
and
it
makes you kind of nervous
when
you have these things happen
you know in your life and um you&#39;re a
little skittish about talking about with
people because they they probably think
you&#39;re
bouncing balloons off the wall or
something but people cannot know what
they themselves have yet to experience
but this happened it was real
and in this case
the
contact was not leaving any kind of a
heat signature it was not leaving any
kind of betrayal it was not moving at a
speed which was proportional to the
normal antenna rotation rate given the
contact signal coming back on the vector
guide given the plot given the minutes i
was making the fixes in 30 seconds
this thing was moving
10 15 miles in 30 seconds 20 miles then
30 miles then 40 miles then 100 miles
and in virtually
uh three and a half minutes this thing
moved you know almost 500 miles
at and then moving from one altitude to
another that would cause any normal
pilot to black out let&#39;s say
uh was very strange to me this was a
real contact and this signal from this
contact at that distance and that
altitude was sending back a signal as
strong as a roosevelt itself and the
roosevelt was over a thousand feet long
it was a lieutenant commander whom i
didn&#39;t know very well he hadn&#39;t been on
board very long and he came over and he
asked you know
what was up jordan what do you got in
your log and he says you don&#39;t need to
put that in there it&#39;s basically the
gist of it and now to me that was highly
irregular
highly irregular to say that
particularly in ship&#39;s logs
i did have the contact logged in there
and i started writing in ufo blah blah
blah blah with the iff return all the
procedures and here we had all this
stuff going on
never another word about it and so it
was not recorded anywhere on the ship as
far as i know
unless it&#39;s in the kaplan&#39;s law
or unless it&#39;s in the division
commander&#39;s law as far as i know it was
never log
but i&#39;ve heard
during the sds-48 mission
while they were in orbit and i was
listening on
the ham radio
and i have an omni antenna on house and
then i also have other hand friends
around the country some of them former
navy too
and the astronauts were talking about
uh
we have the ufo under observation
and then i&#39;ve heard him say we have the
alien spacecraft under observation when
blah was up and that audio had became a
part of several video tapes i was one of
the ham operators i did hear that in
fact i called jack
dr casher about that a friend of mine
who had a son going to
to was going to school where i teach and
um
i told him they&#39;re talking about alien
spacecraft they actually use that term
over the airways and
it just stunned me it just stunned me
now
get this
this is remarkable during the sts-48
mission
during all that flap and then the word
got out and i was in touch with a friend
of mine vince de pietro got her space
flight center
i get a call out of the blue from the
payload manager from johnson space
center of the shuttle
and they wanted to talk to me about the
videotape i had
on that mission
what videotape we happen to have and i i
you know
called the house and it was on my it was
on my tape
when i got home and i called back to
talk to him about that
and
he just wanted to know what was up and
how what without what i was listening on
and what i had on my my ham radio
when i would go over to this photography
studio to pick up some of my work there
were interagency cars right across the
street
and guys in suits taking pictures of me
and they took pictures of me and my wife
in kansas city
when we were at worlds of fun
and i told other people about this
because i got very skittish about what
was going on here i was sort of then i
took down the license number of the
vehicle and it was registered off at air
force base
i had air force and intelligence officer
visit me at my house after visiting an
estate in west omaha this guy wanted to
come over and
and visit my house and i asked to see if
he&#39;s his credentials even civilian
clothes and he showed me credentials and
it was us air force
he was an air force officer
and he just wanted to come in and see my
ham equipment so forth and so on and of
course you know i can understand that
i&#39;ve got nothing to hide so i took him
down the basement and showed him all my
stuff
when the f4 bravo&#39;s after they had
launched from the aircraft carrier and
and went up the only
indication i had from listening to the
pilots uh what were the same expletives
that you know what the heck is that
where did it go they couldn&#39;t see
anything except what was on briefly on
their conical scan radar just for about
five or ten seconds and then you know
there was no tally hole at first i heard
one tally hole and then there was where
did it go is what i would hear you know
and what&#39;s the telly hoe a tally hoe is
when a combat air patrol or an aircraft
will happen to make visual contact or
will
make contact with the radar and lock on
and they&#39;ll say tally ho that is a code
for letting
the commander or the co know back on the
ship that they they&#39;ve made visual
contact and have confirmed that there is
a contact there
now i heard that come out and then later
not at nothing there were other guys
there who
i&#39;m talking with uh mr brzezinski
who
was with
the rosie in 61 the year prior to when i
arrived on board
they had a huge
ufo flap where this actually came down
out of the clouds not only lights but
they saw a saucer and their photographs
were taken and we&#39;ve been trying to get
in touch with the photographer who took
those photographs
but there were people coming up from the
engine room to take a look at this thing
and he saw it
and
there were
documents that i have seen that refer to
the roosevelt
uh having several instances of
ufo flyovers and particularly after they
took on board nuclear weapons and i was
on board when they did take those on for
the first time all these guys walking
around with those summoners and then
marine guards and
yeah they brought on the alpha five
alpha aircraft
and they were replacing the a3 bravo
aircraft sky warrior
and um
roosevelt was a very
hybrid type of ship i talked late night
over the phone with the sheriff down
there and with the farmer and his family
and by the time i got down there the
rain had been letting up
and
we arrived there and
uh
met the farmer and went out and he took
us down into the field myself and two
associates with all this equipment a
videotape and
we went down in the field and what lay
before us were some haystacks a sorghum
field which was half harvested
and
there were
some very strange
burns in the middle of this field
there was a 70 foot burn perfect circle
with six equally spaced 20-foot burns
around the outside perimeter halfway
inside
a 40-foot burn in a 20-foot burn
and down the hill from the creek bed
there were nine what the farmer had
referred to hover burns
coming up the hill and
to these areas
the
sorghum field had been irradiated
with a straight line and one side looked
like it had been freeze dried and the
other was still stable
and uh there were the grass was beige
around the outside perimeter of these
circles then a little green and then it
was all depressed on the inside
the
granddaughter of the same farmer
uh had
been walking out with her brother that
morning when we had had the interview
with her when the sheriff was there had
mentioned that they had seen
what looked like a silver tent with
carnival lights on them that night on
the hill and
the farmer and his family had had seen
uh lights also but and the son and
daughter said well dad why don&#39;t you go
down there and check it out
and he said well no i&#39;m not gonna go out
there well the next morning they went
down there after the little girl and the
family called the house about these
silver tents with caramelized because
she thought there was some kind of a
fair or something going on down there
and they went down there and they found
these burns in his field
and that is how one evolves into another
there is a natural step and an evolution
of it but in my first discussion with dr
jesse marcel jr and through the mail
about some of his descriptors and his
father&#39;s descriptors of something that
looked like plastic fishing line to me
that&#39;s fiber optics in 1947
cd-romness computer chips
where is the first wafer thin
proof
of who invented it and who patent it if
it came from somewhere else and was
given to a large corporation
to find its application for military
where we get everything down from anyway
eventually i&#39;ve worked in gas kilns i&#39;ve
worked in
best kilns
and electric kilns
and the ground had been baked
in this area
rock hard it had been bisked
it had been radiated and was rock hard
when
the farmer would go out there to disk
the area up
uh the disc would come up over the plug
and roll right over the top of it and it
had been hardened in order for that to
occur
and the samples that we had taken you&#39;d
had you&#39;d had to have had
a 1200 degree heat in order for that to
have occurred
in some of those areas down there
that&#39;s a huge microwave
one of the
farmers had a sod field a sod farm and a
plug had been turned up in his field 21
feet by 21 feet by 21 feet and it was 12
inches deep and the sod the plug had
been turned completely upside down with
the grass side down
and rocks were sheared clear off
another one a farm pond the ice was four
to six inches thick and had a perfect
circle taken right out of it and he
walked down the farm pond snow on the
ground ice outside way below freezing
and there is a little
fog hanging over the pond ice and no no
no particles ice around anywhere just
ice plug taken right out of the farm
pond
the burns on that particular farm in the
area now the sorghum has
been uh
is beginning to come back um
the
grass in that area predominantly that
grows now is growing out not straight up
it&#39;s growing out in rosettes and little
tufts
which we&#39;ve taken pictures of the 70
foot plug in the ground has a three inch
crack that&#39;s two feet deep and that has
been essentially filled in by the
tilling and the farming that&#39;s been
going on over the years but no matter
what is planted there when it grows it&#39;s
a different color and you can still see
and here we are in the year 2000 and i
just spoke to the farmer not more than
four or five weeks ago because i knew
you were coming here to
take this interview in the scoop that
was taken out of the haystack and i
looked in the scope myself uh at home
and i still have some of those samples
by the way i&#39;m sure i do in the little
metal containers the um
the
the cuts when you look at uh the cuts in
hay if you cut it with a pair of
scissors and you look at it under a
microscope if i could illustrate it this
way
and and the mind&#39;s eye is like like if
you take a bee hive that has hexagon
shapes in the honeycombs and a beehive
and if you take a
steak knife and you try to cut the
beehive discreetly between those cells
so you can cut out each honeycomb cell
that has a hexagon shape
okay it&#39;s very difficult to do
now you take and you magnify that
a thousand times ten thousand times and
you look at the cellular structure of
a leaf or a blade of grass or in this
case hay
and you look at it under 500
magnification and you look at the cells
there&#39;s no
this there is no destruction of the cell
or the epidermal wall of the cell there
is discrete cutting between the cells
now even if you took a surgeon took a
laser and went in and and cut a vein or
try to repair it or something like that
that&#39;s one thing but when you&#39;re looking
at under a microscope you have to ask
yourself what kind of technology could
do that
many corporations
have been getting you know
wealthy and yes they&#39;ve been providing
humanity as a whole with technological
change that benefit us all
but
they really aren&#39;t sharing the meat
and the source of where it all came from
and
ultimately they&#39;re not sharing the truth
about ufos
they aren&#39;t sharing the truth about ufos
they are real
puritan the planet is becoming
intellectually celibate in my opinion
people are walking around in a daze they
have no idea
no idea
what is going on
no idea
i counted nine of the night that i saw
them they were around the typical disc
type aircraft
spacecraft but they were there they were
illuminated they were quite visible
their configuration was very conspicuous
they were not aircraft because i&#39;m
i have been a pilot for 20 years and
i&#39;m acquainted with what aircraft look
like
