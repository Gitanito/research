  		              		Experience Description   

    I was cycling down a country lane. I neared the opening to a local nature park, which was just in front of me to the left. A car was on the opposite side of the road indicating it would turn into the nature park. A speeding car swerved around the indicating car and onto my side of the road. This is when time slowed down, almost like a scene from the movie "Matrix". I swerved and narrowly avoided the speeding car which was now moving in slow-motion. The car sped on, and I went into a ditch. This happened in a split second, but it felt more like 10 seconds. I reacted quickly to avoid the car.  Yet, it felt like I had all of the time in the world to swerve to the ditch.  This was the only place I could go to avoid being hit by the speeding car. 

Simultaneously, in super-fast motion, events from my life flashed before my eyes. After the incident, I was fully aware of what had happened.  I felt a combination of calm, relief, and curiosity.   I wondered how I managed to move out of the way of the car and also experience the memories of my past in slow motion.
