A Brief Biographical Sketch of
V. G. Rocine
I, the physician co-worker of V. G. Rocine, have under­
taken to give a brief biographical sketch of this unusual
man to the public.
If you, through me and Rocine’s books, can live longer,
be happier, succeed better, make the most of yourself, ac­
complish more, understand others better, enlarge your bank
account, live a better life, and have more on the soul’s credit
page when you die,—I will feel well rewarded.
We are in a school of experience, one depending upon
the other. We are differently gifted. Each has his own
God-given talent and success sphere. Each has his own
weakness and ailment. It is our highest and noblest duty to
help each other. The money that we make should be used
for noble purposes. We can take nothing along beyond the
grave, except our good deeds. "Naked we come into this
world, and naked we depart.”
Who Is V. G. Rocine?
He is an European philosopher who came to America a
long, long time ago, then fully grown and well trained. He
had, then, already been in the army of the King. He applied
for and received a permit from the King to emigrate to
America. His ancestors served the French Government for
generations and were of a long pedigree of nobles.
The father of V. G. Rocine, after losing his estate,
through a sudden depression in stocks, bonds and financial
securities, became so humiliated that, in his desperate con­
dition, he did not even want to use his French family name,
Rocine, but retired into private life, and he and his younger
X V
brother took the name Lundquist, in memory of the lost
estate, and later on told his oldest son, the present V. G.
Rocine, to repurchase the estate so soon as money permitted,
also to resume and use the old French family and ancestral
name, Rocine. Consequently, when V. G. Rocine com­
menced to write and copyright books, he began to use his
French family, ancestral and legal name, Rocine, even
through legal force and action in a court of the United
States.
V. G. Rocine has been serving the public much longer
than half a century, in America, and has been a very busy
man. Fie has delivered about 18,000 lectures and class les­
sons in Europe, United States and Canada. He was a Chi­
cago lecturer, teacher and writer for about thirty years, also
the co-editor of two different magazines published in Chi­
cago. In his earlier academic years, he was intensely inter­
ested in Greek and Latin etymology which he taught in
Chicago for two years, also wrote a course in Greek and
Latin etymology, as a foundation in the English language,
which course is now for sale, price $15.00.
Rocine has written, published and copyrighted for him­
self, or through others, 78 books. He has written books and
correspondence courses for other people as well as for him­
self. Some of his books have been translated into other
languages.
About 111,000 people have passed through his hands to
higher positions, prosperity, health and unfoldment, accord­
ing to the talent, genius and effort of each. For about thirty
years he made verbal success examinations, making from
ten up to one hundred brief examinations a day. When he
settled in Chicago he commenced to make typewritten suc­
cess examinations, personal advice courses, individual type
dietaries, developmental systems, etc. His present method
of making typewritten examinations and type dietaries is
a slow painstaking work, but it brings unfailing results. I
regard him as an honest, reliable painstaking man and the
most able food chemist that I have met.
[ 2 1
V. G. Rocine experimented on living people with sev­
enty-two different diets and lastly formulated a diet system
never heard of before. He is not only "up-to-date” but
also several hundred years ahead of his time. Indeed, if
Rocine’s philosophy and diet system were introduced and
applied in our present doctoring, vocational, social, indus­
trial, political and religious systems, the whole human fabric
would be more complete, and all people made more happy.
Aged in years, Rocine is youthful in mind and appear­
ance, often called the "Diet Marvel of the Age.” He is a
living, walking demonstration of what a correct diet will
do. His faithful followers also know that his diet system
is based on sound principles.
Whenever you hear, or read about "Types,” or about
"eating according to your Type,” or about "the Sixteen
Chemical elements, their voice, language, Bromognosis, eti­
ology, excess, deficiency, functions, properties, use, or their
mysteria specialia, or potentia in actu, or operative activity
in the body”—you can always trace it to this untiring man,
Rocine. "Types,” "type chemistry,” "type immunity,”
"type diathesis,” "type psychology,” "type genius,” "type
diets,” "diet etiology,” "diet diseases,” "health diets,” "dis­
ease diets,” "criminal diets,” "deficiency food symptomata,”
"excess food symptoms,” "sodium hunger,” "health tests,”
"lime type,” "calcic hardening,” "water heart,” "fatty
heart,” "Bromognosis of the sixteen chemical elements in
the body,” "deficiency disease,” "Exesthesic,” "Isogenic,”
"carbonosis,” "Pallinomic,” and hundreds, perhaps thou­
sands of other similar, unique, novel, modern, recent terms,
principles, ideas, data, subjects, etc., coined, originated,
formulated by Rocine were never heard of nor mentioned
in any book, magazine, lecture, daily, college or university
in the world before he made his type discoveries after he
landed on American soil about March, 1867. Neither did
anyone ever hear about a "calcium man,” "sulphur type,”
"oxytype,” "carbon chemistry,” "calcium chemistry,” "Sil-
levitic man,” "carbohydrate chemistry,” "vegetative chem-
[ 3 ]
istry,” "hydrosic chemistry,” "hydric obesity,” "liposic
obesity,” "vegetative heart,” etc., without end before
Rocine appeared on the scene.
The Type Questionnaire that he used and uses in the
studies of types is as unique as he is original. This Type
Questionnaire is a marvel, containing about 4,000 searching
questions, requiring one whole week to answer, many of
which questions learned professors and gray-haired doctors
cannot even answer without Rocines instruction and pres­
ence. With the aid of this unusual Questionnaire, he is still
studying types of people, type chemistry, type diets, health
diets, type tendencies, type analysis, type genius, and other
studies along the same line.
V. G. Rocine, although an ex-doctor, does not practice
medicine. He has developed his own profession. He studied
medicine in two colleges. To enter this medical school, he
had to pass an examination before the Superintendent of
Education, Peter A. Downey. Sixteen credits were required.
As a result of this examination Rocine had to his credit
twenty-two credits, or six above those required. This in the
face of the fact that he passed the examination in a lan­
guage foreign to him, proving that he had had a classical
education where he came from. Let any university bred
man in America go to a foreign country and pass an exam­
ination in a language with which he is not familiar and it
will not be easy for him to pass.

tendent of Education:

Here is an affidavit from Emily H. Rocine, Chicago
co-editor of V. G. Rocine;
"Chicago, Dec. 26, 1930.
"T o W h o m It M ay C o n c e r n :
"V. G. Rocine graduated from the Chicago Institute of
Phrenology and from the Haddock & Holt Institute,
receiving the title Ph. D. V. G. Rocine discovered the
Twenty Chemical Types of People, and had his own notes
of some of these Types as early as 1904 to my knowledge,
and I think had been making observations of them fifteen
or more years earlier than this, as he had many times told
me. He commenced to write descriptions of these types
and to have the same multigraphed by a Miss Her­
rington who worked for us at that time. Eleven of the
Chemical Types were written and multigraphed at this
time, covering 423 pages of closely written multigraphed
pages. This was during the year 1915. From these notes
and with the aid of two secretaries, W. J. Phinn and Elise
Grewatz, during 1920 and later, the descriptions of the
Chemical Types were classified and at the same time V. G.
Rocine wrote and classified the remaining nine Chemical
Types.
"No one else had ever written anything on the subject
of these Chemical Types of People prior to the time that
V. G. Rocine had his Chemical Types of People published.
"V. G. Rocine taught Latin and Greek etymology in
our school, i. e., The Rocine School of Human Nature
m
Studies, and he had a thorough knowledge of Latin and
Greek etymology, and from the Latin and Greek etymology
he originated names for his Chemical Types, such as Iso­
genic, Exesthesic, etc.
"V. G. Rocine in 1908 passed an examination before the
Superintendent of Education, Chicago, and received 22
credits. He took a course in Medicine in two Chicago
Medical Colleges.
"V. G. Rocine has written, mostly in Chicago, begin­
ning in 1905:
"37 printed books
"16 mail order courses of study
"5 maps (diet, brain and face)
"21 pamphlets on the subject of diet pertaining to types
of people from a chemical standpoint and food analysis.
"V. G. Rocine edited a magazine of his own in Chicago
for a time, beginning in 1903, and he was co-editor of
another, with the writer, for 8 years, and at that time
V. G. Rocine wrote a series of articles under the name of
"Brainus” as well as under his own name.
"V. G. Rocine has always paid his bills promptly.

" (S e a l ) .”
Following is an affidavit from an aged man who knew
V. G. Rocine in Europe, and who has been intimately
associated with Rocine during the entire period that Rocine
has been before the American public:
"Los Angeles, Calif., Jan. 14, 1931.
"Mr. F. C. Lynn, Pres. Oakland Bionomy Club,
"206 23rd St., Oakland, Calif.
" D ear Sir :
"Understanding you wish to know quite fully about
the history and facts regarding Dr. Y. G. Rocine, I hereby
aver: That I have not only known Mr. Rocine from child-
[ 6 ]
hood, but have been intimately associated with him from
time to time.
"In Sweden, about 1865, when I was but a boy, I saw
him and his library of Swedish text books, which I subse­
quently learned consisted of etymology, grammar, zoology,
chemistry, physiology, physics, ethnology, anatomy, optics,
dictionaries, etc., which he was diligently studying. At this
time I was with him about 6 months.
"About 8 years later I saw him in Utah and being with
him quite frequently during my stay there for over two
years, I saw the skeleton, maps and charts together with
the notes, drawings and observations he had taken on the
first eleven chemical types of people, the remaining nine
he completed at a later date. I was with him when he
made his first observation on the "Goat type,” which he
now designates as the "Silevitic” type of people. I helped
him to name some of the types, suggesting naming them
from Greek and Latin sources, as he was familiar with
Greek and Latin etymology even before leaving the old
country. The many different traits, tendencies and inclina­
tions of people and the almost numberless occupations,
trades, professions and business pursuits must have been
the basis and incentive to induce Mr. Rocine to undertake
the study of types in order to differentiate between any
two, and to name in any one the predominating character­
istic, by type. The idea was new and original with Mr.
Rocine, and since having no books or literature in his
possession touching upon the subject of chemical types, the
discovery is exclusively his own, and for which he deserves
all the credit.
"I was interested in the studies of mathematics,
astronomy, psychology and science in general and took
great delight in the association with Mr. Rocine and his
library of science and research. I marveled at his unusual
knowledge and profound insight of human nature and at
his ability to explain derivatives of technical and scientific
[ 7 ]
words, phrases and terms without referring to either Greek
or Latin dictionaries. He seemed to know intuitively.
"Seven years later or in 188 5, we met in Denver, Colo.,
and being still unfamiliar with the American language he
wrote and lectured in Swedish.
"Desiring to become more proficient in mental phil­
osophy, he went to San Francisco two or three years later
to attend the institute of Haddock & Holt and was
awarded a diploma with the title D. Ph. which he showed
me upon his return to Denver.
"Then he went to Chicago to take a course and gradu­
ated in Phrenology under Prof. L. A. Vaught, whom I also
knew personally, having secured from him a phrenological
delineation of myself.
"In 1893 Dr. Rocine, being now conversant with the
American language, he wrote and lectured in English, his
first article appearing in the magazine "Human Nature’
and "Human Faculty,” published in Chicago. He wrote
and published several books including one very large
volume not printed, but multigraphed, which he sometimes
called his bible. At one time, about 1910, he needed money
for publication of a book he had just finished writing and
knowing his sincerity of purpose and unquestioned honesty,
I unhesitatingly loaned him $1000.00 on his word, every
cent of which he paid back with interest a little later.
During my visit at the home of Dr. Rocine from January,
1922, to July, 1923, I saw and handled both old and new
manuscript written by him in both Swedish and English,
in quantity equal nearly a ton and which he values at
$20,000.00.
"He was continually writing and with my help in
multigraphing, a large number of magazines (books) was
prepared. I also assisted in the work of preparing his large
quantitative food chemistry map, for later publication.
"In conclusion I would say that I have had many
dealings with Dr. Rocine from time to time for a period of
[ 8 ]
over sixty years and always found him reliable, honest,
faithful, and fair-minded and in every way trustworthy
and competent.

Mrs. O. K. Monson testifies under oath in regard to
Rocine’s work, service, character and integrity:
"San Diego, California, January 17, 1930.”
"V. G. Rocine,
"143 8 Madison St.,
"Oakland, California.
"D ear Sir :
"With pleasure we make answer to your letter telling
of attempts to discredit authorship of the many books you
have written. As one who has known you for twenty-
three years, attending your lectures, reading your books, and
watching your development of the science to what it now
is—to us attempts to discredit you appear ridiculous.
"We have known for some ten or twelve years that
[ 1 0 ]
others were using parts of your writings as their own.
My brother bought a set of books by a widely advertised
author. It was evident as I read them that she knew
something of your science. But her superficial books had
little of value beyond what she had plagiarized from your
publications. I learned that she had not even attended one
of }rour lectures.
"Since that time I have learned of many others who
have travelled, lectured, and given personal instructions,
incorporating some of your discoveries, always taking full
credit to themselves except when closely questioned-—then
they hastily said they had studied under Dr. V. G. Rocine.
However, in each case investigated, it was found the indi­
vidual was a plagiarist.
"On several occasions during the past few years the
magazine sections of widely read Sunday papers have had
a page or more devoted to types of people and the foods
they need as well as their special tendencies and gifts. But
only once, to my knowledge, was credit given you as the
author of their information.
"We, who know you and your life-time devotion to
these lines of study, and the many wonderful discoveries
you have made, have deeply regretted these thefts from
your many volumes.
"We now have five of your courses of study, besides
Mind Training, Heads Faces Types Races, Chemical Diag­
nosis (five vols.), Foods and Chemicals, A Thousand Facts
About the Brain, and your later four books. We have
always wanted to possess a copy of each of your many
books.
"Our son, who attended your School in Chicago, has
both volumes of your Chemical Types of People. He has
climbed high in the business world, benefiting much by
the knowledge of men resulting from the study of your
science.
"How any one could question your authorship is
[ 11 ]
beyond us. Many of your coined words have not yet been
adopted by others, and your diction is distinctly character­
istic.
"Those who are educated along these lines are impressed
by the depth and thoroughness of your knowledge of the
subjects you treat.
"There are doubtless thousands of people who, having
heard you lecture, would immediately recognize the unique
style in your books.
"Trusting this may be of service I am having it
acknowledged.

[ 1 3 ]
V. G. Rocine has written, or writes to order, for
licensed physicians, myself included, any of the courses
enumerated in his catalogue. He has written one book for
Mr. Hauser, one book called "Revelations of the Face” for
Mr. Conroy, a Chicago business man; one book for a
Japanese nobleman; one affinity book which he sold to his
daughter, Vera Rocine, who is now in the publishing busi­
ness herself, after graduating in science, literature and
classics, and who re-arranged this book, copyrighted it,
and named it "The Gentle Art of Loving Wisely.” V. G.
Rocine has written tons and tons of development courses,
diet systems, success examinations, regimes, essays, articles
for dailies and magazines. His writings are so fascinating,
modern and popular that a great many people who never
wrote a word before became authors at once after reading
Rocine’s work on Type Chemistry and Food Chemistry,
the same as Ralph I. Shadduck suddenly became an author
and writer after he got hold of five of Rocine’s manu­
scripts. V. G. Rocine has made success examinations, hired
people and written courses for firms, institutions, schools,
factories, private individuals, backward boys and girls,
feeble-minded people, and has rescued many from the
asylum of the insane with his unusual regimes. He has
planned university courses of study for hundreds of
students. He has helped to re-organize failing businesses
by hiring efficent sales forces and proficient office execu­
tives. He has guided thousands of boys, girls, men and
women into their success vocation.
V. G. Rocine says that work is man’s salvation; that
it is work, a correct diet, good habits and Food Blend that
keeps him (Rocine) efficient. Like Mr. Edison, Rocine
works from twelve to sixteen hours a day, notwithstanding
his advanced age.
He has written, published and copyrighted, this year,
his "Absolutely Reliable Employment Guide,” also a new
edition of his "Type Questionnaire,” which he uses in the
[ H ]
study of types. He has written and copyrighted also this
year one book, "Bionomy and Kitchen Chemistry,” which
will be used in the chemistry department of his coming
college as a text book. He is now copyrighting two book­
lets, one on Flu and the other on Pneumonia. He has
planned the outlines of six other text books which are to
be used in his coming college. The sooner those text books
are ready, the sooner there will be a college of BIONOMY,
the sooner we will have teachers of this great philosophy,
and the sooner the world will have competent BIONO-
MISTS, instead of ambulating speechifiers. He is also, now,
preparing a book, "Self-Analysis for Type-Classification.”
In the fall of 1914, with the aid of his stenographer,
Miss Willis, of La Grange, Illinois, V. G. Rocine com­
menced to write from previous notes that large book, or
set of books, now known as "Chemical Diagnosis.” This
manuscript was completed in 1917. In 1918 this manu­
script was turned over to a prominent chemist, Dr. Craw­
ford, for a critical examination and approval from a
chemical viewpoint. This manuscript was printed, copy­
righted and placed on sale in 1925, in a set of five volumes,
and called unbeknown to the author, "Chemical Diagnosis,
Bio-Chemistry, by V. G. Rocine.”
As V. G. Rocine is intensely interested in Types, Type
Chemistry, Diet Experimentation, Bromognosis or The
Voice or Language of the Sixteen Chemical Elements, when
lacking or in excess, and as these studies and discoveries
were exclusively his own, he was sorely vexed when he
learned that his researches were labelled "Bio-Chemistry.”
What is bio-Chemistry, anyway? It is nothing else than
biological chemistry, or the study of living beings, animals
and plants. It deals mainly with living organisms from a
biological, zoological and botanical viewpoint. It is in
reality, botany, biology and zoology considered in their
relation to chemistry.
The discovery of Types of People; the study of Type
[ 1 5 ]
Chemistry; the results, records, observations and data
gathered from long pains-taking diet experimentations
with 72 different chemically unbalanced, or chemically
balanced diets, scientifically tested on healthy young
people; and all such experiments, effects, data, discoveries,
researches, laws and principles unfolded, classified, de­
scribed, edited and copyrighted—surely is not bio-chem­
istry, neither did V. G. Rocine ever call his researches bio­
chemistry, nor has his profession anything in common with
bio-chemistry. His Type discoveries, Type Chemistry, his
many different tested diets, his Type descriptions, his Type
and Diet researches, his Bromognosis or Voice description
of the sixteen chemical elements, when deficient, or in
excess, in the body, and his philosophy which enables him
to measure mind, analyse character, understand dispositions,
guide genius, gauge souls, study brains, know crafts and
professions, teach Types, and direct people into their suc­
cess spheres—is not bio-chemistry, nor psychology, nor
astrology, nor palmistry, nor doctoring, nor fortune­
telling, nor psychometry, nor spiritualism. It is a new
system, science, art or philosophy of man, brain, mind,
soul, genius and occupations, based mainly on—
1. The Sixteen Chemical Elements of which man is
composed.
2. Type Chemistry and Type discoveries.
3. Diet Experimentations (Bromognosis).
4. Applied Quantitative Food Chemistry.
5. Experimental Etholysis.
All of the foregoing studies, researches and discoveries,
V. G. Rocine includes under the term BIONOMY (from
Greek, bios, life; nomos, law), as V. G. Rocine has ex­
plained to me.
V. G. Rocine is a food chemist, student of science,
doctor of mental philosophy, research worker, ex-doctor,
[ 1 6 ]
but he is in a profession of his own, never heard of before.
He is neither of the foregoing. He is a BIONOMIST, and
nothing else. He has many titles and many diplomas. But
he uses none of them, for he has developed a new profes­
sion, never heard of before. Men like Edison, Dr. A. T.
Still’ Dr. Hahnemann and others who developed some new
system do not depend upon titles. Moreover, who should
give Edison a title, or Dr. A. T. Still, or some other dis­
coverer or inventor? Those who must learn and copy,
practice and apply what the discoverer, inventor or origin­
ator teaches or writes—those are the ones who require a
title to show that they have been properly trained, that
they are proficient in that special craft or profession.
No public man or woman of wealth, no human ben­
efactor ever yet offered one single dollar in favor of
Rocine’s work and researches. Unaided he has been a mis­
sionary and research worker all his life, earned and spent his
own money for researches, cuts, drawings, stenography,
printing, research travel, multigraphing, etc. Every avail­
able dollar earned he donates to books. He has earned and
donated about $210,000.00 to books, printing and re­
searches, and many are they who have tried to appropriate
and commercialize his pen products and even brand him as
a bold pretender.
A Challenge
In consequence, I, the physician co-worker of V. G.
Rocine, hereby challenge any man or woman, bio-chemist,
scientist, historian to produce any book, daily, magazine,
history, science, essay, or written lecture, or anything that
treats of the Twenty Chemical Types of People, or the
Bromognostic effects of the deficiency or the excess of the
Sixteen Chemical Elements, or about the application of
Quantitative Food Chemistry according to the laws of
Type Chemistry, or about the laws of Type Dispositions,
or Type Genius, or Type Tendencies, previous to 1867.
There are many who claim that they have studied
under V. G. Rocine, which may or may not be true that
they have. Those who have studied and graduated under
V. G. Rocine have his diploma as proof. Those who have
not a diploma from V. G. Rocine are not qualified to prac­
tice his profession, nor are they authorized to do so.
To become proficient bionomists, students require, out­
side of mail course studies at home, at least 3 years of
personal instruction in advanced studies under V. G.
Rocine. V. G. Rocine has had hundreds of so-called stu­
dents (nibblers), but none ever studied long enough to
graduate and receive a diploma. Hence, none is authorized
to practice, nor apply Rocine’s new discoveries.
V. G. Rocine makes no claims to anything else than
his type discoveries, type descriptions, type chemistry,
Bromognosis, type dispositions, type genius, the study of
[ 18 ]
vocational qualifications, type diseases, type etiology, and
the application of quantitative food chemistry to types and
type chemistry.
He has studied the books written by Dr. Gall, Dr.
Spurzheim, the Fowlers, Geo. Combe and every available
book on phrenology, and uses phrenology, physiognomy
and other branches having a bearing on man, whether past
or present, and has graduated from two schools of mental
philosophy; he has studied everything available on quanti­
tative food chemistry and gives full credit to 72 of those
noble chemical workers who have labored so faithfully in
laboratories in the interest of food chemistry and human
health. He also gives full credit to Dr. Gall, the discoverer
of the functions of the brain, and to all phrenologists.
Perhaps no one deserves greater credit than Emily H.
Rocine, who was Rocine’s co-editor and business manager
for many, many years. Rocine wishes to have it known
that Emily H. Rocine deserves great credit for faithful
service to humanity in general and to this philosophy in
particular.
