The doctors gave their report and left. I was laughing and joking with my wife and nurses. When: BAM, I was gone and I was in a place that couldn't be described as earthly. I was in a place or state that was void of everything and I needed nothing. The closest inadequate description would be ‘Nirvana’. It was wonderful. 

I wasn't there very long before doctors pulling surgical equipment out of my body dragged me back to life. Within seconds, I was back laughing and joking with the nurses and my wife again. Since that event, I've come to realize my life (as I know it) could end any moment. I have lost all fear and apprehension of the future. In fact, when my time is up it will be accepted and welcomed.
