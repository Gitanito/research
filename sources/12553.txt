Everything was just as usual; I went in the sea with my cousin and kept going until the waves were reaching up to my neck. My cousin had stayed behind me. At this point, I felt that I was going under, I had fallen down a hollow and in my desperate state I dragged on my cousin and we were both started to drown. In my instinct for survival, I was climbing on his back to breathe, and he was doing the same thing. Exhausted from all my efforts to get out, I gave up and was swallowing water, when suddenly I saw something like a video of my life, every moment was seen. Just then, it was a wonderful thing, and after seeing this video I regained consciousness, and my cousin, who had already managed to get out, said to me: 'Crawl!' I crouched and crawled, which is how I was able to get out onto the sand. I felt heavy after swallowing a lot of water.
