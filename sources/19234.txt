how do these how do these groups manage
to get money from they got government
money how do they do
that working outside the
real govern
agencies he asked how do they get the
money um from public coffers to run
these sort of projects it&#39;s actually a
very good example of it is one of our
Witnesses who uh worked for um saic
science applications international
corporation in La Hoya California is the
headquarters and this is one of the
crown jewels of the Contracting entities
that deal with this issue and saic deals
with many issues but they sort of have
companies within companies within
companies that&#39;s the way it&#39;s
structured and this particular witness
who&#39;s one of the disclosure project
Witnesses was a woman who had been
recruited to work for the company and
she was in a
program that um basically was a room and
a bunch of file cabinets and what she
did they took in millions of dollars
based on a
grant and uh or a a proposal for funding
research it went into their office went
out the back back door the funds to a
black project and what she and the other
people in the office did was Jen up
reports that would go back to the
government and to the Auditors that were
completely bogus and when she asked
where is this what&#39;s the real research
going on with this money she was shown a
file just full of these empty
reports
so obviously that&#39;s fraud but that is
how they work so um exam for example the
you know
the B2 stealth bomber might cost a few
hundred million dollars actually to
build they tell the Congress they cost2
billion a piece well the other missing
1.3 billion goes into the emgs the
electromagnet gravitics or other
unacknowledged special access projects
so this is sort of just the way it is
done and because of the nature of top
secret compartmented top secret
TSI uh TSA SEI top secret special
compartment at intelligence when you get
to the unacknowledged level nobody who&#39;s
who if unless you&#39;re in that compartment
you&#39;re not going to report anything out
to any external person I don&#39;t care who
it is certainly not the CB the
Congressional budget office or the
Auditors at KPMG or whoever it is they
just don&#39;t report it out it&#39;ll be
reported out out on these
phony things and this is why when
Rumsfeld said there&#39;s 2.3 trillion doar
unaccounted
for I mean again this was this was not a
flaming liberal it&#39;s not Abby Hoffman
saying this this is the you know the
secretary of defense for George W bush
and Dick Cheney saying this so um so you
don&#39;t believe me maybe you&#39;ll believe
him and that it&#39;s just unaccounted for
but that&#39;s how it&#39;s done I just this one
little example um and uh so a lot of it
is kind of overbilling and
overcharging you hear about the these
massive costs 500% cost overruns th%
well it&#39;s not cost overruns per se part
of it is is that it&#39;s just going into a
black project and being diverted but not
just Department of Defense and
CIA um I have people who worked with the
first Bush presidency uh Bush senior who
said that they were pulling money out of
HUD Housing and Urban Development and
other
agencies that would be things that were
inflated pric that would then be
siphoned off into black projects and
that is done routinely and so
um now there&#39;s another way of doing
it
um ah I don&#39;t know if I should go into
this or
not this is
the this is the dark end of it okay so
there you know one of the meetings I had
um was right after we did the meetings
in 1997 for members of Congress and for
for Admiral uh Kramer um uh I mean
Wilson at the Pentagon um the J2 head of
intelligence joint staff I had a meeting
with a former member of
Congress uh and a senior senior
executive with saic at Crystal City here
near National Airport at this former
congressman&#39;s condo and this Congressman
was had been for many years s of a
conigliari uh to uh George Bush
senior and he said do you understand how
dangerous this group is I said yes he
says but do you understand where a lot
of their funding comes from I said I
have a very good idea where are you
going with this and the SI saic
executive had recently retired and moved
out of the country to
France and both these people asked me
not to disclose their names but this is
put me under sodium penthol I&#39;m telling
you the truth here they said well we
use these anti-grab devices and they
launch we hours of the night from
various places and they move billions
hundreds of billions of dollars worth of
clandestine drugs and armaments around
the world and he said there is one group
that is involved uh it&#39;s like a small
army he said of people of 8,000 men
that have been involved in just moving
uh Contraband around the world because
it&#39;s all cash and it&#39;s
untraceable and we have killed 2,000 of
these men for minor infractions of
security okay this is not a conspiracy
theory these were two principles with
firsthand knowledge of it warning me of
what this group is really into
so one of the reasons therefore fast
forward to another
problem um if we can if
the drug
war has been created so that by making
it
illegal it not only keeps it
criminalized but it cre creates a domain
or so these super black illegal
operations can kind of pluck the lwh
hanging fr fruit and have a very large
I&#39;m talking hundreds of billions of
dollars of
funding by being kind of integrated with
these criminal
Enterprises you know now I&#39;m not in
favor of drug use but I think it should
be completely legalized for that
reason um and that would just suck all
it won&#39;t be now they&#39;ll wrap themselves
in Morality and public health and all
this other stuff they could care less I
mean you know any kid any middleaged I
mean middle school kid can go to
anywhere and get any drug they want in
the DC area or even out in Virginia in
the rural area I live
in it it&#39;s so that it creates their own
little
Monopoly and it does and this is not a
conspiracy theory because I have met
with the principles who were involved in
those operations so that&#39;s another
source of funding now there&#39;s another
source of
funding um so we have the black budget
of the United States government 10020
billion a year you have this cend in and
very dark criminal Enterprise running
drugs and armaments and then you have
another source and that is I call them
the corporate
spin-offs pieces of junk like
this
um the
Technologies at Murray
Hill uh facility AT&amp;T um in the early
early days Bell Labs uh lock heat
there&#39;s a lot of technologies that have
been spun out out of as as Colonel Corso
said in the day after Roswell that were
studied that have made their way into
the
public by
studying extraterrestrial
material that have come from our Downing
of these uh aircraft
spacecraft those end up going first into
these acknowledged projects but then
they get moved into their corporate
partners and then get
monetized as a
product fiber optic integrated circuits
uh computerization miniaturization
special Material Sciences a lot night
vision technology a lot of these things
came out of those classified projects
that were studying ET Technologies now
what they&#39;ve held back are the energy
generation and propulsion system systems
but they have monetized and become
enormously wealthy through these others
that have been
monetized now we the taxpayers have paid
for that research and but it ends up
getting a patent and get spun out as
Look What We
Invented now most people you know and
it&#39;s interesting that this guy named
theal who was one of the co-founders of
PayPal I believe recently said in an
interview with fared Zakaria on
CNN that there has been no real
discoveries and and progress
technologically in 50 or 60 years and
this was on CNN it still takes you the
same amount of time to go from JFK to
Paris now as it did in 1964 50 years
ago and that basically what we&#39;ve done
is sort of Tinker around the edges now I
know people want to hear me say this the
people in Silicon Valley and who think
they&#39;re high-tech with this I mean we
had telephones hundred and some years
ago so um are are just like appalled I
said yeah but the Internet was developed
by DARPA the defense Advanced research
projects
Administration um the technologies that
are in
here were spun out of these covert
programs and then people innovated them
they did Innovation and applications not
Discovery
so and if you come up with a fundamental
new discovery in science and technology
that is really disruptive
I.E free energy or something like that
uh it will be
confiscated either under a national
security order or if it goes through the
patent process through the patent law
Provisions for
seizure um and if not that they&#39;ll just
flat out take it and tell you to be
quiet or else um so and that&#39;s true of
people at universities
industry private in inventors Etc I know
many many many people who&#39; have had that
happen here in Washington the Federation
of American Sciences said well look you
know there have been
5,135 patents that have been seized well
the reason for that is that the things
they don&#39;t want out are things that are
true
breakthroughs so if you look at our
society yes we have an internet and you
have an app so you can go find your
restaurant you want to find instead of
looking through the Yellow Pages but
it&#39;s just the Yellow Pages has digitized
it&#39;s no big deal we&#39;re still running
this thing and all the lights in this
building off a Coal Fired power plant
from the
1800s your car is the same engine
Mercedes had in the 1800s internal
combustion the jet engines were
developed in the 30s invented Rockets
40s Atomic power
1945 no real fundamental breakthroughs
in science and technology since then and
that&#39;s what Theo was saying thel the
multi-billionaire and I think it was
sort of an astonishing statement for a
lot of people but he was being honest
about it so but there has been
monetization that way which has created
enormous revenue for a lot of these
corporations
