I suffered appendicitis / peritonitis. I was anesthetized but I saw light, only light, white light everywhere, but it did not hurt my eyes. I felt even much better than ever. I would have liked staying asleep forever but there was my family. I knew my family would split apart. My mother suffered from depression and my parents were on the verge of divorcing. Then I decided to awake.
