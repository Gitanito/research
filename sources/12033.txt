            		Experience Description:   

I was walking underneath a multiple-story building that was being built. They were working on the second floor. As I passed underneath, one of the steel poles used to hold up the walls slipped out of the men's grasps and fell. It smashed me on the head and knocked me unconscious. Those who saw it said my head slammed into the pavement hard as well.

As soon as my vision faded to black, I saw these strange beings. They were on a landscape of white and seemed to be made of fire. However, something about them was rougher and scarier than fire. They were screaming as I was falling, a terrible sound, and they were throwing blood everywhere. The blood became an ocean. The fire beings remained until I came to with an oxygen mask pressed over my face.
