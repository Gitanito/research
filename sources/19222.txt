so I&#39;d like to thank all of you for
coming from all over the United States
it turns out for this I&#39;m dr. Steven
Greer and the director of disclosure
project and C SETI and serious
disclosure comm and the Orion project
these projects I&#39;ll explain very briefly
in a moment the purpose of this seminar
today is really to go in-depth and share
things I have not shared publicly about
how disclosure has happened because it
has happened and is happening and what
the process was led up to that but I
wrote first want to thank you guys for
coming here and having the interest
because it&#39;s it&#39;s the public that has
actually made disclosure happen from the
beginning although it was requested by
some folks at the end CIA which we&#39;ll
get into it&#39;s the public that&#39;s really
enabled it including all the now 550
top-secret military and corporate
witnesses that have come forward now I
want to state that at this point the
numbers are continuing to grow and most
of those Witnesses are people who&#39;ve
been in the intelligence community or
Department defense some branch of the
Armed Forces or corporations that deal
with so-called unacknowledged special
access projects super-secret projects
that deal with UFOs and only about a
fifth of them have consented to be
filmed and have their persons identified
to the public the reason for that is
fear and concern for their own privacy
and concerns over some issues that I
don&#39;t think we need to worry about at
this point around the legalities and
we&#39;ll get into this over the course of
the day and the main purpose of the
disclosure project was really to educate
the public
that we&#39;re not alone in the universe and
that this has been known by highly
classified projects for seventy years
and that those projects have
unfortunately could become illegal and
unconstitutional operations that operate
transnationally note that I said
transnationally not internationally the
secrecy that surrounds this issue is so
extraordinary that most presidents are
not briefed on it and if their brief
they&#39;re briefed in a way that it&#39;s
perfunctory and very very limited and
designed to control their actions for
example Ronald Reagan was provided some
information but only insofar as it was
false so that he would support SDI the
Star Wars missile defense program so
that he could justify the spending but
for the most part presidents since
Eisenhower have not had appropriate
access control now what I mean access
control this means not only access to
the program but control over them and
people need to make a real I want at the
very beginning a very clear
understanding between knowing and being
able to do anything about it so every
single president has been interested in
this famously Jimmy Carter as he was
president-elect was asked by was asked
asked the outgoing CIA director George
Bush Senior to brief him on this issue
because he had had a sighting some of
you may know this while he was governor
of Georgia I have that report and
President Carter president-elect Carter
was told by then outgoing CIA director
Bush that he would not tell him about
this issue and he didn&#39;t say he didn&#39;t
have information he said I will not
share that with you and directed him to
get it from the Congressional Research
Service believe it or not to saying that
to the incoming president of the United
States and this is well documented in
this cool
your project witness testimony from
people who were privy to what happened
and I think that this is why folks have
to understand that just because that
someone is the president or the chairman
of the Senate Intelligence Committee or
for that matter the head of the CIA does
not mean that they&#39;re going to even know
about these operations now when I first
started out on this it was an accident
of what I my real initial love was and
that is peaceful interstellar contact I
started out doing what I&#39;m doing you
know while I was working full-time as an
emergency and trauma doctor in North
Carolina because I thought it was time
for humans to show a different face to
the cosmos one that wasn&#39;t militaristic
one that wasn&#39;t xenophobic one that
wasn&#39;t fearful the one that was hopeful
and forward-looking and so I founded the
Center for the Study of extraterrestrial
intelligence 25 years ago you know and
see SETI see SETI to do exactly that
and so we sat upon this project sort of
just grassroots and right away but
within a year or two we had contact all
of you know what happened near Pensacola
where we were out on a beach with about
50 people a couple of them were Air
Force pilots a colonel and another guy
and there were four et craft that
materialized and vectored in and was
filmed very poor film footage old high
eight night scopes
but it was actually quite close this
ended up on the front page the pensacola
paper the next day and that at that
point what I was doing got put on the
radar scope of the national security
state of folks dealing with this this is
the part of the story most people don&#39;t
understand I never intended to be
involved with this aspect of it because
what I really wanted to do was create a
grassroots movement that basically
bypass the you
government or any other government to
make contact with these civilizations as
citizen diplomats much like physicians
for Social Responsibility were citizen
diplomats to the Soviet Union during the
coldest days of the Cold War darkest
days of the Cold War and but on an
interplanetary interstellar level
unfortunately I got diverted not stopped
from doing that other project the ce-5
Close Encounters of the fifth kind
initiative which is when humans go out
and intentionally invite make contact
but I was pulled into what I&#39;m doing now
with disclosure project because I was
asked to so within a month of that event
in Florida in March of 1992 I was asked
to go to a conference in Atlanta now I
thought it was just a conference I got
there and it was half of magic this
covert group that deals with UFOs
they&#39;re the former head of Army
Intelligence was there there were NSA
people there there were dia people there
by etc and so on and they preside
proceeded to sort of ask me what the
hell do you think you&#39;re doing I said
well I&#39;m doing what I you can read it&#39;s
all public I don&#39;t have any secrets
about it we&#39;re a team to make contact
with these civilizations outside of
governmental channels because the
government is broken and I was informed
it was none of my business and not to do
it and I said try stopping me so we kind
of had a mano a mano was not pretty till
3:00 in the morning in a hotel room and
you know and I said this is what I&#39;m
going to do so there were people opposed
what the ce-5 contact program was from
the very very earliest days most people
don&#39;t realize that on the other hand
there&#39;s a senior official at the CIA who
flew down on a jet to my town in North
Carolina Asheville North Carolina to say
do it and don&#39;t give up someone&#39;s got to
do this
because it&#39;s completely out of control
and moreover someone&#39;s going to have to
spearhead not only making contact
but informing the public because the
system is so completely dysfunctional
now the person who was sent down was a
man whose family founded the California
Institute of Technology the most
prestigious one of the most prestigious
universities in America and is
associated with NSA and CIA and I said
well I&#39;m a country doctor in North
Carolina rambling around in an ER and
you know I&#39;m doing this sort of it&#39;s
just a ad hoc group to do this he says
no well someone is going to have to do
this but also is gonna have to educate
the public and I said well I&#39;ll do what
I can in between er shifts and raising
four children and as things went you
know that was sort of the initiation and
and my initiation into this sort of
weird down the rabbit hole world of
secret projects and why is this guy
coming as an emissary of this very
senior CIA person who&#39;s involved in this
begging me to do something why don&#39;t
they just do it anyway so you&#39;re gonna
see this Lake motif repeated over and
over again over the course of today and
at that point I said okay well I will do
what I can and a few months later there
was a man named Bill Clinton got elected
to the presidency of the United States
and I was immediately approached by
people who are friends of his and who
said well you know this is something
that he&#39;s very interested in and it&#39;s
well known that his good friend webster
hubbell
who was third in command at Justice
Department prior to being convicted of
some other problems said that the bill
clinton asked and when he did he wanted
to know about two things who really
killed Marilyn Monroe
because he had a fascination with
Marilyn Monroe and who killed Jack
Kennedy and also what is this UFO stuff
is there anything really to it so he
made a directed inquiry and as webster
hubbell reported in his book friends in
high places this is not you take read it
and see
they made inquiry into the subject and
they will quote were not happy with the
answers they were getting which is a
polite way of saying they know they were
being lied to
well at that about that time and a
little bit before some of the Clinton
folks approached me some military people
who were friendly to disclosure
approached me who had had experiences
either on battleships or at Strategic
Air Command facilities where our nuclear
facilities remain or proposed and said
you know I&#39;ll do anything and to help
you and one of these men was a naval
commander who was very connected up in
the Pentagon and he showed up at my door
basically and at my home and I thought
initially he was a spook a spy and I
said well this spook is probably here to
disrupt my project and turns out he was
a totally stand-up guy who did
everything he could to set up a number
of the meetings you&#39;re going to hear
about behind the scenes in deep
background briefings that I did at the
Pentagon subsequently and we decided to
have a meeting I was invited by a former
State Department person to have a
meeting at the Monroe Institute which
isn&#39;t ironically about ten minutes from
where my country home is now in Virginia
to discuss how to put together a team of
people to brief the correct folks in
government and encourage them to end the
secrecy now you have to understand this
is 1992-93 22 years ago twenty-one years
ago I was in my 30s a bit naive about
how government worked
I actually thought we had a functional
constitutional government
I have since learned we do not that
that&#39;s all window dressing that&#39;s all
the Truman&#39;s show like the movie The
Truman Show where it&#39;s all sort of a
fake and that there&#39;s a parallel
governmental process that runs this and
other important issues that are
completely out of the reach of the
people we elect and a point but at that
time so we had this meeting and it was
decided that we should contact certain
key people in the US government to in
military speak deconflict the cset ii
contact teams from air force and other
military operations so that they didn&#39;t
interfere with us and we didn&#39;t
interfere with them that was the purpose
of it was to deconflict that because we
didn&#39;t want interference from those guys
with what we were doing which we were
getting a lot of interference we were
getting helicopters jets all kinds of
stuff coming in to our contact sites and
we still do to this day which have been
filmed and documented so unfortunately
we we said this is something that is
really critical if we&#39;re gonna make
contact and not have it become something
where something terrible happens
accidentally okay so my military advisor
who came forward said let&#39;s see what I
can do and run this up the flagpole as
they say and so he he knew the head of
intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of
Staff an admiral who Admiral Cramer with
a c CR Amer and he went in had a meeting
and said look we really need to have a
meeting with the Air Force in tell
people at wright-patterson Air Force
Base to which the Roswell remains were
sent and which still had what was called
the National Air Intelligence Center and
then it became the foreign aerospace
Technology Center
it was always FTD affair and technology
division of the Air Force back in the
40s and 50s it&#39;s gone through many name
change it&#39;s the same facility at
wright-patterson Air Force Base in Ohio
and he said okay let&#39;s let&#39;s see if you
can set up an
and the Admiral now this is a head of
intelligence Joint Chiefs of Staff
pushed back from the desk and said are
you serious about UFOs and
extraterrestrial intelligence and the
commander military commander who was
volunteering to help us said yes were
very serious and so the Admiral said
okay I&#39;ll do it so they refused to take
the meeting now so what happened is that
j2 what&#39;s called j2 head of intelligence
Joint Staff called the head of Air Force
intelligence and said you will make this
meeting happen and dr. Greer will be
received there because they have
something to discuss with those folks
and that was now the fall September 1993
okay so it would that sit meeting was
set up now in the meanwhile some folks
working with Boutros boutros-ghali
the UN secretary-general at the time and
Laurance Rockefeller who was the scion
of the Rockefeller family who was the
philosopher king of the family I mean
David Rockefeller was sort of the money
guy with Chase Manhattan which became
JPMorgan Chase and his nephew Jay
Rockefeller was chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee and Nelson
Rockefeller who had passed away who had
been vice president ironically was his
brother who had set up the Rockefeller
Commission of 1956 that completely
reorganized the Department of Defense in
the CIA
so no US president could contain or
control or penetrate UFO projects so the
Rockefeller family up to their eyeballs
in this Lawrence knew that but he was on
the side of the Angels he wanted to sort
of cleanse the Karma as it were I
believe of that family and actually
helped so a lot of people have of course
attacked me for knowing a Rockefeller as
proof that I&#39;m sort of part of some
cabal I said no they contacted me
because he Lawrence knew that what we
were doing was really novel and was
effective because he had sent people it
turned out
some of our events where we had had
contact where we did the ce-5 protocols
and ET crafts would appear and then
disappear
he went holy they took this information
back to Lawrence and said this is no
joke so Laurance Rockefeller invited me
up to New York and then invited me to
his ranch the j.y ranch in Wyoming and
as you know that&#39;s where the Clintons
for the first couple years of their
presidency would vacation in August but
I was asked to go there in September of
1993 to basically share what he thought
would just be the information about the
ce-5 initiative Lawrence did not
Laurance Rockefeller did not know about
the initiative to brief senior
governmental officials and encouraged
them to end the secrecy which had
started a few months prior to that at
this meeting in Virginia at the Monroe
Institute with a select number of folks
that my military advisors had gathered
together and that was July of 93 so the
heat is thought it was going to be a
discussion about the protocols of the
cd5 initiative remote viewing making
contact interstellar diplomacy all of
these concepts and so we decided that it
was really time for us to go ahead and
have some meetings like this with with
Lawrence and I say okay I&#39;ll go because
I have to go out I&#39;m on a trip anyway
and taking time off from my medical work
in the ER to go to wright-patterson Air
Force Base which also Lawrence knew
nothing about
Laurance Rockefeller knew nothing about
so here&#39;s what happened I was going to I
was going to go to the the Rockefeller
ranch just as sort of a guest to share
this and during the course of a sort of
a round table there were all kinds of
people there
Robert Bigelow of Bigelow Aerospace
who&#39;s a billionaire was there a whole
bunch of people
who various backgrounds in the UFO
subculture some friendly to what we do
and some incredibly unfriendly who we
found out we&#39;re working for the
intelligence community were there and
there was this gathering at this famous
Rockefeller ranch and the Grand Tetons
so one day it came up what else I was
working I said well we&#39;ve initiated a
project to brief senior government
officials in the Clinton administration
in the Pentagon and members of Congress
so that we can terminate secrecy on this
issue and get the government to change
policy because we understand that the
incoming president is favorable to that
idea which was of course Bill Clinton
and as a result you could have heard a
pin drop in the room nobody knew at all
and the first thing Barnes
Laurance Rockefeller said what who what
it was like this what were you do I said
well I&#39;m going straight to
wright-patterson Air Force Base after
this meeting to brief the colonel over
this foreign technology division of the
air force and then I&#39;m going to in a
couple months briefed President
Clinton&#39;s CIA director so at this point
a Laurance Rockefeller and everyone
there was and we&#39;re in a state of shock
now that initiated what has been
incorrectly called the Rockefeller
initiative
there was no Rockefeller initiative let
me explain that in a moment
what it was was an initiative because he
found out what we were doing and his
people said you&#39;ve got to get involved
with this so Lawrence wanted to play a
behind-the-scenes role and that&#39;s why he
was willing to host the president and
first lady at the ranch to provide what
we put together which was called the
best available evidence which is the
collection of best cases best photos
best government documents we had that
were extant at that time in 1993 so the
President and
was invited out in the following summers
two summers to the Rockefeller ranch for
that purpose and the UN Secretary
General in the meanwhile and his wife
came to some meetings and what are
called salons a salon is when someone
hosts a very nice meeting in a private
home with dignitaries and you have a
guest usually some surprise guest or
some interesting character like me to
come in and inform these sort of the New
York 100 about what&#39;s going on so that&#39;s
what I did and they were incredibly
successful subsequent to that missus
boutros-ghali invited us to have a
meeting at the UN so I could brief a lot
of the diplomats and friends of hers in
the UN who were supportive of ending
secrecy and making peaceful
interplanetary contact and actually Leah
gali herself hosted that for me at the
United Nations
