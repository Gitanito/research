I was transported to the hospital emergency room, in there by 3:00 am. There were about six emergency room people working on me, I was in and out of consciousness the whole time. 

All of a sudden everyone was gone and there was this bright, bright light (all I could think of was from what I heard about the bright light that this was it) so I said out loud 'OH SHIT!' Then one of the nurses that were standing next to my head said to me, 'WHAT!' 

I came back to consciousness and could see everyone again. They prepared me for a catheterization, ballooned me, and inserted a stent. The nurse told me what I said and I remembered the light and told her that's what I was making my remarks about, thinking this was it. We all laughed and she said I might want to rethink my last words.
