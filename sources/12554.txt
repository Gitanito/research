After coming through the clouds, I found myself descending towards a very beautiful landscape, with green meadows, rivers, butterflies and birds. I was moving towards a hill with a tree on top.

The sensation I felt I cannot express in words, but it was so wonderfully tranquillizing that the desire is there to return and feel it over again.

Before I reached the tree, I felt the landscape darkening, and I felt as if I was being dragged backwards at great speed, taking me away from this place; then I found myself in the hospital again, surrounded by people. Although I felt weak and breathing was difficult, I could not stop thinking about that place.
