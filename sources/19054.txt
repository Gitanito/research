I&#39;m here to make a very special
announcement that&#39;s why we&#39;re here in
this beautiful ballroom with a few
lovely people who randomly were able to
get here
serious technology advanced research
which is a little group that we found
that brought out the film serious and is
we&#39;re doing a lot of this work now under
that umbrella is is announcing a
$100,000 challenge and award available
to anyone who can deliver to us here in
the Virginia area an operational device
that meets certain criteria the money&#39;s
in the bank go to our website you see
it&#39;s been donated or it&#39;s there now you
say $100,000 isn&#39;t much money but it
actually is because if you look at the
fact that right now there is a quantum
energy generator that&#39;s on the internet
supposed to be open-source there is
information from the Keshe foundation
there&#39;s information from other things
that are now supposedly open-source that
people are saying there&#39;s YouTube video
showing it&#39;s doing this and people have
asked me why in fact one of our
supporters for the serious film so why
don&#39;t you just go and build one I said
look to hook up our DVD player my wife
has to do that I am such an idiot you
know give me a defibrillator or a
respirator or no problem but that stuff
No
so look I don&#39;t build I&#39;m not a machine
guy with a lathe so we would have to
engage someone to do that and people say
other than why don&#39;t you I said because
I have several thousand videos and
several thousand documents in
two-dimension purporting these claims
and it would take probably a hundred
million dollars to build them all up and
how you determine which one is
legitimate so we&#39;re turning this around
the other way if it is what people say
it is supposed to cost five to seven
thousand dollars to make one of these
even custom lathe and custom you build
it you bring it we&#39;re not going anywhere
because we practiced all over the world
and it&#39;s been just a wild goose chase to
be honest with everyone
we will have it independently tested and
if it is legitimate it has to have plans
with it that are not secret and that
nothing has been altered what that would
allow us to independently reproduce it
by somebody who is not associated with
the inventor or the people who are
advocates of the technology truly an
independent person if it is not
reproducible it isn&#39;t science and it
isn&#39;t going to be made 7 billion copies
to run 7 billion people&#39;s homes cars and
what-have-you and if it is not able to
be tested transparently until proven
otherwise we&#39;re going to have to assume
if there&#39;s a trick now that&#39;s perhaps
too harsh but that&#39;s been our experience
and since we have expended almost a
million dollars already going all over
the world doing this trying these other
approaches this is the approach that
we&#39;re willing to go forward with that I
think will work and I think everything
else is a waste of time money and
resources now what are the criteria for
getting this award okay number one it
cannot be something running off a wall
socket because there could be a circuit
in there tricking the power phase angle
I just explained that cannot if it&#39;s
running on a battery pack or capacitors
or something that starts up the system
those have to be completely recharged
from the output while it carries a load
what do I mean by that let&#39;s say you&#39;ve
got this prototype proof of principle
thing and it starts up it needs 500
watts of power to start it up and it
runs and then it kicks in and it has a
circuit where it is legitimately pulling
in from the zero point energy field
quantum vacuum flux field if you want to
call it that the Dirac see whatever your
favorite term is and it&#39;s putting out
five kilowatts of power well if you have
an output of five kilowatts it should be
no problem to take out of that five
kilowatts and put the 500 Watts back
into the front end so that those
batteries stay 100% charged got it
I can help design
circuit in my sleep by the way even it
has to be a switching circuit between
batteries some people say oh you can&#39;t
do that because it kills the thing I
said good then you put in a switching
circuit on the front-end batteries but
no tricks and then it&#39;s running four and
a half kilowatts of usable excess
electricity to run appliances or what
have you
I&#39;m just using this as a example now it
could be something that only it takes a
hundred watts in that stays charged from
output and a kilowatts coming out so you
have nine hundred for a proof of
principle thing it doesn&#39;t have to be
something that&#39;s going to be ready to go
to manufacture it has to be something
that I can put in front of the people
that I meet with the weekend and week
out and weekend and week out who want to
see a solution like this they really do
but they haven&#39;t seen it and when I tell
them well I&#39;ve seen them at this skiff
or at this lab they go yeah but I want
to see one and you know what the public
needs to see one but they need to see it
with independent testing by people who
are going to publish and put their name
to the fact that I tested this prototype
and this is what it is doing and then
another laboratory says I&#39;ve taken the
plans that were provided for the
prototype and I have independently
recreated the effect reproducibility at
least once if not three times which is
what would use the rest of the funds for
that we&#39;ve we&#39;ve we&#39;ve been able to have
donated and made through the film
serious so the hundred thousand dollar
chant we call it the serious challenge
and award and it&#39;s one hundred thousand
dollars for anyone who can legitimately
bring we&#39;re not going to go to the
outback of Australia to look at a kind
of of Prada maybe it&#39;s got to be
brought here not to DC but to Virginia
near the University of Virginia and it
has got to be able to pass these
criteria it also cannot have anything in
it that is hazmat hazardous material now
why do I say that we have tested and
looked at some devices that we&#39;re using
low-level radioactive materials not good
you can make a dirty weapon
that it&#39;s never going to be able to be
mass manufactured so it can&#39;t have
hazmat it can has have anything really
toxic in terms of heads and that
chemicals it cannot have a effect that
is harmful to the environment so it&#39;ll
be tested for environmental effects what
do I mean well I mentioned this
gentleman who&#39;s this incredible
transdimensional physicist and engineer
down in in hunts near Huntsville he had
a experiment he was doing that actually
created a vector and created a spacetime
bubble and amazingly you know like he
accidentally dropped a bolt into this
energy field and it vanished you could
put a broom handle into it and that part
of it would go into another dimension
this sounds like science fiction it is
not this senior scientists and neighbor
research labs who I know very well who
has stated our home I&#39;ve known him for
many years saw this but unfortunately
when he was experimenting with that he
created a energy field where an ax
scientist who was standing next to it
half of his body got hit by that and
half of his body is aging at twice the
rate of the other half literally sounds
like something out of the outer you know
limits or whatever they used to call
that so these technologies say it has to
be something that&#39;s that&#39;s safe it also
needs to be something that is not going
to disrupt FCC channels Federal
Communication in other words if you
switch that on and your local FM radio
station goes offline you&#39;re going to get
a knock on the door or if you switch it
on and all cell phones are disabled or
if you switch it and this is an effect
of these Sciences you know there&#39;s a guy
who works in the science direct at CIA
and that I&#39;ve known for 20 years
and he says says we have a name for
these things WS FM weird science and
freakin magic and my uncle were you know
worked on the Apollo landing the lunar
module and at Northrop Grumman they just
call it P fm pure frickin magic
and it is it&#39;s the high end of
electromagnetic mainly magnetic field
sciences that result in all kinds of
phenomenon so you have to be careful you
have to know what you&#39;re doing and some
people have known and some haven&#39;t so
there there is a there there are effects
so it would have to be able to pass the
test that there&#39;s not a biohazard an FCC
communication hazard to normal band wits
of cellphones and radio and TV because
you don&#39;t be or what have you or create
and it vertically a blackout and
electromagnetically in an adjacent
building I know one guy who is
experimenting with this and every time
he turn on this system
everyone&#39;s garage doors in his
neighborhood we&#39;re going up and down
like this seriously so these are all
things that have going to have to be
evaluated in 20 some 24 years of me
being involved with this I now know what
to look for which someone starting out
would take them 24 years to discover and
the device also meeting this challenge
has to be stable what do I mean by that
let&#39;s say it works in Massachusetts but
you move it from Massachusetts to
Virginia and the electromagnetic and
magnetic field of the earth is different
in Virginia than it is there and even
from place to place you can go to places
in Colorado where there&#39;s huge changes
in the in the Gaussian the measurement
of magnetic field at one point versus
another even in one Valley if it works
in one point and doesn&#39;t work in the
other that&#39;s a problem unless you&#39;ve
developed an algorithm of how to attune
it to adjust for the magnetic field
variations that surround Earth that is a
serious technical issue believe me I
tell you I have seen things that
absolutely work in one point you move it
doesn&#39;t work that&#39;s not what we call
robust so the technology has to be
open-source the person cannot want a
patent or want to keep it secret it has
got to be something that can be openly
shared with the public
it has to be stable it has to be free of
hazardous effects it needs to be
something that&#39;s putting out a
measurable overunity of amount of power
meaning more than what&#39;s going in with
the input power continuously charged and
it needs to be able to run in a stable
fashion for a sustainable amount of time
what do I mean by sustainable at least a
day now we were once involved in an
operation out of the Caribbean and a man
had sort of resurrected the Tesla
Stubblefield earth battery everybody
know what that is
you put these zinc and copper poles in
the earth and you actually can run and
and he had you know several hundred
watts of electricity coming out of this
thing but it would only work for about
20 minutes 15 minutes in any wicked
political cut off we went why why is it
cutting off in 20 minutes mmm something
not right well we thought maybe just
needed more engineering so we took this
it turns out that the electrolyte
content of the soil it took a genius to
discover this from documents from Russia
from the early part of the 20th century
there has to be a certain electrolyte
composition of the soil to feed and be
flowing through these copper and zinc
alternating pipes for that Stubblefield
Tesla battery there we have pictures of
it on our website to operate on a
sustainable basis and that was the
secret that the inventor let the
inventor the guy trying to reproduce it
didn&#39;t know but he didn&#39;t want to admit
he didn&#39;t know it so he started playing
a scam on us which cost us a couple
hundred thousand dollars so that&#39;s why
it has to be something that can work on
a reliable basis for a sustained amount
of time because if it clunks out in 10
15 20 30 minutes there&#39;s something fishy
going on and that to troubleshoot that
failure could very well cost hundreds of
thousands of dollars literally to get to
the bottom of with some of the most
brilliant people in the world who know
this particular area of electromagnetic
phenomenon and that&#39;s a very very small
number of people that we know of who can
actually work on this with us who aren&#39;t
assigned to the agency or to Lockheed
skunkworks or what have you so we have
to do this in a way that has our eyes
wide open having learned what we have
over the last few dozen or so years if
someone has such a thing and I am
convinced this out there they need to
contact us and there will be on our
website an application and a
questionnaire so that we can undo an
initial intake review of it and then
they will be if it passed all those
evaluation criteria they will even be
invited to come to have it tested but
they also must leave with it the plan so
it can be reproduced because if they
have for example done something that
works and it&#39;s legitimate but they do
something like stan meyer did where he
left out or just changed by a few
thousand voltages what the voltage or
the hertz needs to be no one will be
able to reproduce it and that doesn&#39;t
help the planet and we&#39;re not willing to
do it has got to be independently
reproducible by not me and not someone
who&#39;s an advocate of new energy but just
a person who who can has skilled in the
art of fabrication machining electrical
engineering mechanical engineering a
team that can do that and if that can&#39;t
be done and if the person can&#39;t do it
and it also has to be done in a way so
that the person isn&#39;t going back and
forth with the inventor because if the
plans can&#39;t if they&#39;re not truly well
thought through plans where a skilled
people person can do it like a proper
formula then the science may not be
there it may be a bunch of guesswork
where you have to do an iterative thing
and where now that we have seen this
where there have been scientists who
have stumbled across an effect but they
didn&#39;t keep or they didn&#39;t you know how
what the voltage and frequency was when
they hit that sweet spot and so every
time they try to create a device it&#39;s a
bunch of guessing for months and
sometimes years because they&#39;re not
following a very rigorous scientific
method or they don&#39;t have the right
equipment what do I mean by right
equipment it is not a trivial thing to
be doing things with very high voltages
and very high frequencies because you
can&#39;t buy that from a normal Kawasaki
analyzer or even your testing equipment
that&#39;s custom stuff and so to be able to
do this properly if it is something that
requires that you know if it the person
hasn&#39;t been owed a document and then do
a second version of it based on
documentation it may be that they just
accidentally stumbled across an effect
but they don&#39;t know honestly what they
did and I know such a scientist in
Canada who will admit this he absolutely
he did have the effect it actually was
something that lifted but he had no idea
exactly what what he did and no one
since it&#39;s been will reproduce it so
again the sin of winona science
independent in testing and verification
and independent transparent
reproducibility at least once if not two
or three times so that&#39;s the requirement
for this star challenge and award I&#39;m
hoping someone steps up to the challenge
and gets the award I mean the hundred
thousand dollars are sitting there on
the bank so come take it but it&#39;s going
to have to meet this criteria it cannot
be snake oil and it cannot be secret and
it has to be open source we do not want
to talk to anyone let me be very clear
who wants this secret patented or in any
way an intellectual property issue maybe
this is our intent to do this as an open
source like lens or some open source
software Linux or what it is I&#39;m not a
software guy I&#39;m just a doctor from
Virginia but the truth of this is if the
person is out there or if some of these
open source things that are just
surfaced in the last year on the
Internet
legitimate and they really do only cause
five to seven thousand dollars for
someone to make it then they can get a
pretty nice return for their trouble
