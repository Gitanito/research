W hether the title given to this sm all b o o k is the righ t

T he stu dy o f life -y o u r life, the life o f the U n iv e r s e - is
really a study o f anatom y. N o m atter w hat fo rm o f life

the su b stan ce o f the particular em bodim en t, bu t o f the

that th in g w hat it is and m ak e it do w hat it d o es. In
relation to the hum an b ein g, the crow n in g ach ievem en t

and so m e people m ay be in clin ed to turn fro m it as
ex p ressin g a coarse and v u lgar sentim ent; but it is a
scien ce that every hum an bein g in terested in h is or her
life sh ou ld study.
F o r to do so is m erely to stu dy o n e’ s ow n an atom y
and the transcendental force w ithin the su b stan ce o f

THE SCIENCE OF MENTALPHYSICS
I V I e N T A L P H Y S IC S is that interpretation o f all
re lig io n s and p h ilo so p h ies w hich is b ein g sought by
everyon e. H ere th eir inner truths, their practical
ap p licatio n in ev ery d ay life, and their recon ciliation
w ith Scien ce, are em bodied. M en talp h y sics is the key
w h ich u n locks the d o o r to the hidden m ean in g o f the
B ib le and all H oly B o o k s. It is, in fact, the G ospel o f
the N e w A g e - a p o w er in the hands o f those w ho
faith fu lly fo llo w its prin ciples w hich lead s to se lf
m astery, the realizatio n o f our high est capab ilities, and
their actual dem on stration in p h y sical vitality,

in telligen ce, grow th o f character, n obler and m ore
abun dan t lives.
H appin ess, jo y , p e a ce , harm ony and the victorious
accom plish m en t o f ou r w orthy aspiration s, all reside in
the pow er to w h ich M en talph ysics is the guide. The
p ractices taught h av e been found b y hundreds to be
revolu tion izin g in their effect. A m eth od is taught,
rather than a creed, a m ethod w hich h as been used by
w ise m en for th o u san d s o f years to av ail th em selves o f
p o w ers little kn ow n to the m ultitude, to approach
greater kn ow ledge o f the im m ensity o f m an ’ s true
cap ab ilities, to rise victoriou s over sick n ess, and w ant,
an d u n h appin ess—to realize the final Truth o f L ife and
the final V ictory o f M an .
13
CHAPTER ONE
WHAT IS THIS THING CALLED MAN?
J . W A S once ask ed to give from the p latfo rm a
defin ition o f “ M an .” I w as lecturing on S e x o lo g y and
P aren th ood to m en only, and I sp o n tan eou sly said :
“ M an is the p o sitive elem ent in the hum an k in g d o m -
the p erfect chem ical apparatu s, the p erfect electrical
instrum ent, for the p erfect ex p ressio n o f the U n iv ersal
F o rce and U n iversal M in d .” T o d ay I cannot im p ro v e on
that definition. W om an, o f cou rse is the n egativ e
elem en t in the hum an k in gdom , en joy in g sim ilar
perfectio n for the sam e pu rpose, an d each m an and
w o m an - M A N - em b o d ies die crow n in g ach ievem en t
in creation.
(a) A Transcending Truth
M an Is the C reator In H um an Form . I w rite this
sen tence in the deepest reveren ce. W hat po ten tialities
o f po w er and w isdom ! W hat su rp assin g action !
M an h as com e very near to the con q u est o f the
m aterial U n iverse. H e alm o st literally h as all th in gs
under h is dom inion, yet w ith all h is k n o w led ge he
la ck s, generally speakin g, an y degree o f in tim ate
k n o w led ge regarding h im se lf a s m ad e in the “ Im ag e o f
G o d ,” h is very bod y the “ T em p le o f the L iv in g G o d ,”
the C reator w ithin him . F e w m en truthfully an d
in telligen tly can say o f th em selv es that in their b o d ies
they see the transcendentally beau tifu l, the in fin itely
intricate and the m ost glo rio u sly accurate in strum en t in
the U n iverse. Such, how ever, is u n m istak ab ly the truth;
and, m oreover, M an - ph y sically , m en tally and
sp iritu ally - is the T em ple o f the G o d that liv e s w ithin.
14
(b) Whence and Whither?
“ W hat,” cries N ik o la T esla, the fam o u s scien tist and
inventor, “ w hat h a s the future in store fo r this strong
bein g, b o m o f a breath, o f perish able tissu e, w ith his
p o w ers, fearfu l an d d ivin e? W hat m ag ic w ill be
w rough t b y him in the en d? W hat is to b e his greatest
deed, h is crow n in g ach ievem en t? L o n g ago he
reco g n ized that all perceptible m atter cam e from a
prim ary su b stan ce, o f a tenuity beyon d con ception and
fillin g all sp ace the A k ash a (or lum in iferous ether), or
P ran a or C reative F orce, callin g into existen ce in never-
en din g cy cles all th in gs and phenom ena.”
M an is truly an em bodim en t o f the C reator.
M an is not body, but M in d: he h as a body, he is a
M in d - u n iversal, divine, eternal. M an ’ s body is his,
not he the b o d y ’ s. T h e bod y is a ch em ical com pound,
one m ay say , and as a ch em ical su bstan ce is w orth but a
fe w cen ts; but M A N - let him give than ks! - is nothing
short o f the C reator in H um an Form .
A n d so w e com e to see that you, w hether you are m an
or w om an , are not m erely an eater, a drinker, a sleeper,
a w orker - a b ein g dependant upon m ere an im al
p leasu re fo r h igh est enjoym ent, but the direct agent o f
the C reator, by w h om there h as been directly entrusted
to y o u the ch arge o f carrying on the hum an race,
through sta g e s o f evolution tow ards the con sum m ation
o f a P erfect C reation .
(c) The Most Beautiful Act
T o the av erage in dividual, sexu al intercourse is o f
15
suprem e im portance. It ever h as been, and the sex u al
urge in m en and w om en h as b een handed o n through
the race m ind to every creature b o m o f w om an . A t the
sam e tim e, you w ho read, in com m on w ith m ultitudes
o f av erag e people everyw here, are perh aps ig n o ran t o f
the true pu rpose o f the sexu al relation. It is the m o st
beau tifu l, the m ost in spirin g, the m ost sacred an d holy
o f all our acts; and, properly approach ed an d carried
out, is the divin e m ean s by w h ich w e m ay elevate
o u rselv es to a vibration so high an d su rp assin g ly lo v ely
as, through it, to see and understand that the K in g d o m
o f H eav en Is W ithin U s.
16
CHAPTER TWO
WHAT IS YOUR LIFE FORCE AND
HOW SHOULD YOUUSE IT?
j t t l l l fo rce co m es from the U n iv ersal Supply.
U n iv ersal fo rce IS . Y o u cannot ch an ge it. I cannot
ch an ge it. It sim p ly IS. There is no p lace w here it is
not. Y o u an d I are in and alw ay s h ave b een w ithin this
great o cean o f fo rce in its U n iversality. It is the force in
w hich w e live and m ov e and have our b ein g, and this
ap p lies to every liv in g th in g-th e b egin n in g less, the
en dless.
T h e riddle o f the U n iverse is about u s and within us.
W e m ay so lv e it i f w e w ish, and so go on from height to
heigh t o f k n o w led ge—or w e m ay run on through life
w illy-nilly, a s the great m ajority o f h um an s do, and go
out o f the earth life with very little m ore true
k n ow ledge o f o u rselv es and our relation to the U n iverse
than w e h ad w hen w e entered this life.
(a) Creative Principle explained
L e t u s try to trace th is U n iversal Force.
F an cy that you are in the park. Y o u are silent and at
rest, seren ely con tem platin g N ature, an d you see, as
yo u p ro b ab ly h ave never n oticed before, a C reativen ess
everyw here. T h is Creativeness is alw ay s at w ork. It is
never ceasing in its activity. It knows its work
absolutely.
N o w I invite you to T H IN K . Ju st re lax and think.
C o n sid er any liv in g th in g -sa y , an ap p le tree. D o you
not see that the ap p le tree know s h ow to m ake apples,
and is the on ly th in g that d o e s? A n o y ster—do yo u not
17
see that the oyster kn ow s ex actly how and w h ere to
bu ild its sh ell and m ake the p e a rl? M an can im itate, but
he can n ot m ake a pearl. The Creative Spirit within the
oyster knows.
A n d this is true o f every liv in g thing. The Creative
Spirit within the acorn knows exactly how to make the
oak tree.
N o w , as w e lo o k at this C reativen ess, this C reative
Sp irit, w e are com pelled to see three thin gs:
(i) T h at IT IS IN T E L L IG E N T . . .W ise, b e c a u se it
K N O W S H O W .
(ii) T h at it is E V E R Y W H E R E P R E S E N T . . . Y o u
cannot im agin e it not b ein g everyw here.
(iii) T hat it H A S T H E P O W E R T O D O A L L
T H IN G S . . . T o m ak e the apple, the oy ster, the
o ak and A L L T H IN G S IN T H E U N IV E R S E .
(b) The Scheme o f Creation
N o m atter w hat else m ay com e to our m in ds w e shall
h ave to adm it that these three w ords em erge:
O M N IS C IE N C E , O M N IP R E S E N C E A N D
O M N IP O T E N C E . T h ese three - O m n iscien ce,
O m nipresence and O m nipotence - co m p rise the triune
activity o f the O ne P R IN C IP L E that is d ie o rig in o f all
thin gs.
W e fin d then that the G od that w e h ave alw ay s
v isu alized , w hether as a B e in g up ab o v e the c lo u d s in
so m e n ebulous p lace called H eaven , or in an y other
m anner, is really the C R E A T IV E P R IN C IP L E
E V E R Y W H E R E E Q U A L L Y P R E S E N T , that can be
known as intimately as a father knows his son. Then
com e to see that the U n iverse an d G o d are not separate.
A lso that created m an and the C reator are not detach ed.
“ G o d is in m an and M an is in G o d fo reverm ore.” They
are not separate entities.
18
A n d now , p le ase think carefu lly as w e go slow ly
alon g. L et the ligh t o f this stupen dous Truth flo o d your
M ind. Y o u w ill see that you have discovered the basic
fact o f all existence, the greatest thing that any m an can
know .
C on tem plate th is profoun d Truth in th is m anner:
Question Answer
A re you, or are y o u not, a part o f the U n iv e rse ?.......I am .
C an the U n iv erse b e com plete w ithout all its
p a rts?.........................................................................N o , it cannot
T herefore, w ithout you, can it be c o m p lete?................N o
T herefore, its com p leten ess literally depen ds
on y o u ? ..........................................................................C ertainly
T herefore, w ithout y o u it cannot ex ist in
c o m p le te n e ss?...........................................................................N o
N o w yo u can sa y in all truth: “ B E C A U S E O F T H IS I
S T A N D T O T H E U N IV E R S E A S A C E N T E R D O E S
T O A C IR C L E . IN T H IS C A S E I A M T H E C E N T E R .
T h e circu m feren ce is everyw here. W IT H O U T A
C E N T E R N O C IR C U M F E R E N C E C A N E X IS T .”
G oin g b ack o v er w h at w e h ave read w e see that in the
C reator is A L L T H E P R E S E N C E there is, A L L T H E
P O W E R (F orce) there is, A L L T H E W ISD O M there is.
A s nothing can e x ist O U T S ID E o f the A L L , w e arrive
quite lo gically , do w e not, at the w onderful know ledge
that “ T H E C R E A T O R IS A L L T H A T T H E R E IS .”
C arry the id e a on ly one step farther and, rem em bering
w hat you h ave read, yo u can truthfully affirm :
“ Sin ce the C reator is A L L T H A T T H E R E IS , I
A M T H E C R E A T O R D IF F E R E N T IA T E D IN T O
T H E H U M A N F O R M .”
19
C arry the id ea another step and w e arrive a t the m ost
stupen dous truth that can ever be know n, sin ce all
hum an know in g is in so m e w ay derived fro m it. Y o u
can now truthfully affirm : “ T H E R E F O R E ,
W H A T E V E R T H E C R E A T O R IS , I A M .”
(c) What Works the Machine?
A n d the Force that p rop els this m arvelou s U n iv e rse is
in Y O U in its fu ll quality--you u se it as yo u w ill! Y o u r
thought dictates the w ay you w ill u se or ab u se it.
H ow do yo u u se it? In a w ord, by the breath o f you.
“ G o d breathed into h is n ostrils the B reath o f L ife and
m an b ecam e a livin g so u l.”
T he Scien ce o f M en talp h y sics, fo llo w in g in the
fo o tstep s o f all occu lt teach ers in all lan ds an d in all
periods, prov es that there is to be fo u n d in the
atm osph ere a su bstan ce from w h ich all life is derived.
T h is force in the San sk rit is called Prana, w h ich w e
am p lify to m ean A b solu te E n ergy, the V ital F o rce, the
E sse n ce o f L ife. I repeat that this P rin cip le o f all
en ergy in the U n iv erse is everywhere present. It is all-
pervadin g. W herever there is L ife , there is P ran a, it is
in you. M o d e m scien ce p ro v es that in e v e ry atom ,
every electron, every ion, there is L ife —and P ran a is the
E n erg y that the soul u se s—it is the en ergy th at y o u u se
in the sacred act o f your life w hich w e are d isc u ssin g in
this volu m e. A s the Founder o f M en talp h y sics, I claim
that self-k n ow ledge is the only w ay to the k n o w led g e o f
U n iv ersal N ature. W ithin each m an and w o m an is the
O perator o f M iracles. “ G od m ade m an ,” w e read in
A cts X V II, 27-28, “ to the end that he sh ou ld seek the
Lord, i f haply he m ight feel after him and fin d h im .”
T he U n iversal F o rce—call it by an y nam e y o u w ill- is
the L ord (T he L aw ), and it is on ly b y “feeling after
him” and “ finding him ” w ithin o u rselv es th at w e can
understand the Lord.
20
(d) T h e T rue U se o f S e x F orce
Is the relation betw een you and your m ate a
sacram en t, a h oly thrilling act o f true spiritual pow er . .
. or is it on a lo w er plane, reflecting the coarser, baser,
m ore clay lik e sid e o f your nature?
Is it som eth in g that through habit y o u h ave com e to
regard a s a p h y sical n ecessity and som eth in g that you
can dem and o f yo u r m ate as a “ right” . . . or do you, in
this sacred act, ch arge your very b ody, the instrum ent
o f the C reator, w ith unutterably w onderful C reative
F o rc e ?
W hat fo llo w s is w ritten for you in the hope that L igh t
m ay break upon yo u r Path to enable y o u to see that the
prop er u se o f yo u r sex force m ay lead you into the
M ystery o f M y steries, the H oly o f H o lies o f your L ife .
21
CHAPTER THREE
HOW TO USE THIS CREATIVE FORCE
W E h ave seen that M a n -y o u and I—are in a se a o f
pow er, C reative E n ergy. The b o d y yo u h ave built is
your instrum ent for the u se an d ex p ressio n o f this
C reative Energy. In the p ro b ab ly hun dreds o f
th ousan ds o f years o f evolution the hum an bod y, in all
its essen tial parts and prin ciples, h as com e to its present
state o f perfection fo r the so le p u rp o se o f ex p ressin g the
inherent D ivin e Principle.
E v ery part o f the bod y, as w e h ave seen, h as its ow n
sp ecial defin ite purpose.
(a) M an’s First Duty
T h e b od y receiv es the U n iv ersal E n erg y w ith every
breath that you take, and it u ses it w ith every effort o f
the w ill, every w ord, every m ov em en t o f a m u scle,
every em o tio n -th e result o f thought. W hen the
ph y sical m an is in perfect balan ce and the m en tal m an
is properly attuned to D ivin e P rin ciple in thought, it can
be said that a hum an bein g is p erfectly ex p ressin g h is
true nature.
M an ’ s first duty to himselfis to see that his body is in
perfect health, so that in every cell and tissu e -p ro p e rly
form ed in prin ciple fo r the p u rp o se -th e U n iv ersal
E n ergy m ay be u sed in accordan ce w ith the L A W o f
L ife .
W e w ill n ow reverently con sider further w h at this
C reative Pow er, this D ivin e P rin ciple, this U n iversal
E n ergy is —everyw here, in everyth in g—throughout the
U n iverse.
Y o u are sure that yo u h ave a bod y. Y o u can feel the
su b stan ce o f w hich it is m ade. Y o u are sure that within
22
the substance you h av e energy . . . fo r you can talk,
sin g , sw im , ju m p , run, w rite and w ork —u sin g your
en ergy in a th ousan d different w ays. Y o u are also sure
that the en ergy is in the substance o f your bod y, and
that it is directed by your thought, for you do w hat you
d ecid e to do through your thought. T h e re fo re -
(i) Y o u r p h y sical body is substan ce:
(ii) Within the substance o f your body is the
energy. T h is energy yo u cannot see w ith
your p h y sical eyes. Y o u can only see the
effect o f this energy, but yo u feel the
en ergy w ithin the substance.
(iii) Y o u are sure that the m anner in w hich you
u se y o u r energy is directed by your
T hought, w hich is a su b stan ce m ore subtle
than the energy. It con trols and directs the
energy, fo r you u se the en ergy as the
thought directs; you u se the en ergy exactly
as yo u think you w ill.
W hile you know that you think, it m ay be that you do
not kn ow w hat T h ough t is, and it is d ifficu lt for any
teach er precisely to teach w hat it is—though w e are all
aw are that w e h ave at our com m an d an d do u se a
su b stan ce w hen w e th in k -fo r w e cann ot think w ith
“ n othin g.” E veryth in g in N ature has an em b o d im en t-
so m e o f w hich w e can sense, w hile oth ers w e cannot.
M in d substan ce is on e o f those subtle su b stan ces that
cann ot be put under a m icroscope and in vestigated.
Y o u cannot go into a laboratory and p lace your
T h ough t Su b stan ce under a m icroscop e, and then com e
to m e and say, “ L o o k , this is m y T h ough t,” but you
C A N sit dow n an d talk to m e and SH O W m e the
prod uct o f that un seen substance that yo u are u sin g
w hen you think.
23
T h e sam e w ith m an y other substan ces.
O ccu ltists teach, h ow ever, that M in d -su bstan ce is
u n iv ersal and om nipresent. Mind-substance m ay be
liken ed to P ran a* in the sen se that it is foun d in every
p lace in the U n iverse. Its sum total is fixed and cannot
be added to or taken from, and therefore it is
unchangeable. M in d-su bstan ce can be regard ed, a s a
m atter o f fact, as a higher p h ase o f E n ergy or M atter,
ju st a s M atter m ay be con sidered as a g ro sser fo rm o f
M in d -su bstan ce o f En ergy.
( c ) Nature o f the Soul
T h e y o g is o f the F ar E a st claim to h ave p ro v ed that
M in d-su bstan ce w as the F irst M an ifestation , an d fro m it
em an ated E nergy, and from E n erg y em an ated M atter -
so that all form parts o f one real su b sta n c e -th e A L L
T H A T T H E R E IS. O ne m ay sa y that there are three
m an ifestatio n s or em an ation s o f the A bsolute.
I f it w ere p o ssib le for m e as a T each er to ex h ib it a
certain quantity o f M in d-su bstan ce and sh ow it in m y
c la sse s, there w ould be no n eed to try to explain , nor
w o u ld there be an y n eed for the student to try prop erly
to m ak e the personal effort to gain his ow n con ception
o f its pow er. B u t that cannot be done. We have then to
regard Mind-substance as the thing by which is set into
operation the Energy that causes Matter to be in
Motion. Mind-substance can only be KNOWN to us by
its results—
Thoughts, Thought-force, etc.
T h e differen ces a r e - a n d w e sh ould get this d eep ly in
the M in d -
*The Sanskrit word for the origin of life, the life current, the vital
essence that gives life to every living thing.
24
(a) M A T T E R is the thing that the So u l u ses to
clothe itse lf with.
(b ) E N E R G Y is the thing that the S o u l u ses to act
w ith.
(c) M IN D S U B S T A N C E is the thing that the Soul
u se s to think with.
I labor th is poin t to em ph asize that you - in your
p h y sical lo v e live, as in every other activity o f your
life—are Thought in Action. Y o u r glo rio u s bod y is the
instrum ent through w h ich T hought is expressed . M an,
then, is thought in action. H e has but tw o thin gs—his
T h ough t and the U n iverse.
I w rote earlier in this chapter: “ M an ’ s first duty to
h im se lf is to see that h is body is in p erfect health, so
that in every cell and tissu e—properly form ed in
prin ciple fo r the pu rpose - the U n iv ersal E n ergy m ay
be u sed in accordan ce w ith the L A W o f L ife .” I f his
thought is right, all else must be--‘As a m an thinketh,
so IS h e.”
Y o u r sex u al en ergy is actually the en ergy o f the
C reator w ithin you.
H ow vital, then, that this sh ould be properly directed
by you r thought.
(d) Distribution o fSex Energy in the Human Being
It is entirely u n n ecessary here to poin t out that w hen
w e think upon the sexu al relation, there is alm ost
im m ediate p h y sical eviden ce o f the result o f our
thought. C ertain parts o f the bod y are, in the healthy
hum an, spon tan eou sly quickened. I f the body is in
p erfect equilibrium , w e feel this fo rce su rgin g through
our ph y sical bein g, and, i f the thought is persisted in,
both the m ale and the fem ale m ay
25
con ceivab ly , as a direct result o f the thought, e x p re ss
the ph ysical con su m m ation o f se x force, w ithout
con tact with the m ate.
(e) Gradual Growth o fthe Human Being
L e t u s explain this w ay: A child is b o m . H e or she
gro w s. T he period o f puberty com es. T here fo llo w s in
due co u rse the first experien ce o f this n ew foun d en ergy.
W ith this first experien ce a new w orld open s, an d from
the first experien ce the hum an bein g actu ally enters
u pon a program o f p h y sical d estru ctio n -fo r ev ery tim e
the act occurs there is an expenditure o f th o se vital
fo rce s w h ose presen ce w ithin the hum an b od y m ak e it a
th in g divine.
A ll th is is com m on to the race.
N o m atter w here y o u fin d a hum an b ein g—w ith the
ex cep tio n o f rare o c c asio n s w here relig io u s p ractice s
dem an d chastity - life seem s to be one p h y sic a l or
se x u a l cataclysm after another . . . and to th is w e give
the n am e sexu al intercourse. Indeed, it se e m s that
w ithin the substance o f the bod y this inner se x u a l force
in creases to the point o f a v o lcan ic action in the
in d iv id u al, w hich is the only apparent w ay to r e l i e f . . .
an d then again on and on in the sam e w ay. S u c h is
se x u a l expression .
E v e ry adult hum an b ein g kn ow s the effect o f this
e x p ressio n , but it is safe to say that not on ce in a
h un dred tim es is the act the perfect sacram en t it sh ould
be, n or does it even bring satisfactio n to its particip an ts
on a p h ysical plane. E v ery m an w ill adm it that only
rarely is the act in itse lf anything ap p ro ach in g that
b eau tifu l su percon sciou s un derstan din g it sh o u ld be,
an d th is w ill all the m ore readily b e en d o rsed by
w om en .
26
T he sex u al act in itse lf is not n ece ssarily som ething
that b rin gs jo y —it is the thought behind it that
determ in es its nature.
W hether there be actual expression or not, how ever,
w hen w e think the act, and refrain from ex p ressio n —due
to lack o f opportunity or otherw ise—the effect o f our
thought is seen in the body.
T o th ose w ho con sisten tly think se x but have no sex
exp ression , there co m es a peculiar irritability and
restlessn e ss, fo llo w e d by ph ysical lassitu d e and m ental
disturbance, an d prob ab ly serious ill-health.
(f) Sex Repression and Its Results
S o stron g is th is felt today that a gro w in g sch o ol o f
scien tific thinkers d eclares that p ractically all d ise ase is
traceable to an u n satisfied or rep resse d se x life —
particularly in the c a se o f w om en. C on stipation , m ental
troubles, p o o r ey esig h t . . . and a w h ole string o f
n egative p h y sical con ditions are d eclared b y doctors to
have their birth in a disordered sexu al condition, either
in e x cessiv e e x p ressio n or in repression.
W e do not w ish to dw ell too lon g u pon the m ere
ph ysical sid e o f the se x life o f the in dividu al, though its
vital im portan ce w o u ld give u s ju stificatio n .
T h o se w ho kn ow , how ever, w ill tell y o u that all life is
sex life, and i f y o u be perennially h appy, you are so
b ecau se yo u are sex u ally in equilibrium , though you
m ay b e p erfectly chaste. I f you are fu ll o f fe ars and
inferiority c o m p le x e s, lack desire to do som ethin g
w orthw hile in life an d to be a m an or w o m an in the true
sen se o f th ose w o rd s, i f you are critical o f life in
general and fan cy that the w hole w orld is again st you, i f
you are grow in g o ld before your tim e, regard y o u rse lf
as a failu re and can n ot m ake h eadw ay in the p lace in
27
w h ich you find yo u rself, it is all b ecau se o f sex u al
deran gem ent, w rong exp ression , or repression . A ll
en ergy is sex energy, fo r ju st a s y o u w ere en abled to
b u ild your bod y as a resu lt o f the se x en ergy in tw o
h um an b ein gs, so this law ap p lies w ith every livin g
thing.
B u t it is a curious thing that this m o st vital
desideratum o f existen ce h as ever gen erally b een taboo.
A generation ag o , though p eo p le talk ed o f se x m atters
an d w ere probably quite as se x u a lly u n b alan ced as
p eo p le are today, they talked in secret and acted in
secret - w ith ap p allin g resu lts in the m atter o f ven ereal
d ise ase , w hich form s one o f the w o rld ’ s greatest
burden s in our “ enlightened” age.
(h) Sex Energy the Servant o f God
I have spoken o f the hum an b o d y as b ein g the
instrum ent yo u and I h ave been b le sse d w ith fo r the true
ex p ressio n o f the C reative E n ergy w ithin us. T here is a
w a y to get to kn ow this bod y—to fe el the subtle fo rces
w ithin it, to w atch them at w ork an d to see w h at they
are doing, and to quite fully un derstan d the raison
d ’etre o f the sch em e o f things aroun d u s and w ithin us.
In their ignorance m an y m en an d w om en , approach in g
the se x relation in a lew d and c o arse m anner, cru sh the
very high est in spiration that can co m e co n scio u sly to
them . T hey w aste their su bstan ce in licen tiou sn ess and

It is to them that this volum e is ad d ressed , in the hope
that they m ay be led b y the still w aters o f life, into the
inner san ctuary o f their ow n b e in g s, and get to know
that in the abu se o f the se x en ergy w ithin them they are
destroyin g the essen tial su b stan ces o f life w h ich the
C reator in H is bounty h as entrusted unto them .
Y o u r sex en ergy is the servant in the K in g d o m o f G o d
w ithin you.
28
W ithin M an is a kin gdom o f divin e p o ssib ilities, as
every father and m other m ust adm it w hen they look

su ch a w ondrous th in g as their ow n b ab y to be b uilt in

It is ob v iou s that to be opened to the inner pow er and
perfection o f o u rselv es, w e m ust try to cultivate the
spirit o f perfection in the activities o f life. A n d in no
other channel m ore than in the sex u al channel o f life
can w e m ak e q u ick er progress tow ards this end. T hat is

is true that M an (an d W om an) is as old as h is glan d s. *

(c) Principal Glands in the Great Chain
T h e prin cipal glan d s in the G reat D u ctless ch ain are:
(a) T H E P IN E A L G L A N D . - In the Sp iritu al

In fact, it is the developm en t o f this glan d m ore than
any other that “ m ak es the m an .” T h is is, I b elie v e, the

practice, four out of five infants castrated die in infancy. Women
who have their ovaries removed lose their vivacity and brightness,
are sluggish and heavy, unless they have developed a higher
consciousness. They are unsexed and grow masculine in
appearance. Certain sects cause some adherents to suppress all sex
instincts, and the women become masculine in appearance, with a
distinct tendency to grow beards, while the men change in the
opposite direction, tendingtowards a feminine appearance.

CHAPTER FIVE
WHAT MARRIAGE SHOULD BE AND
DO
M a r r i a g e is recogn ized a s a so cial n ecessity
throughout all m ankind. It is the pub lish ed union
san ctifyin g the n atural law o f procreation. M an b u ild s a
hom e fo r his m ate to protect her fro m his covetou s
fello w s, to assu re priv acy for love an d to serve as a
shrine fo r their parenthood, a cradle o f lo v e to w elcom e
each ch ild that co m es as the perfect fruit o f perfect
union.
The instinct w h ich strikes the first sp ark o f attraction
betw een any m an an d w om an is the creative urge to
perpetuate the race, to contribute to the p ro g ress o f
m ankind. That is w h y any love life ou tsid e the so cial
law u su ally en ds in disaster. It fru strates its very
purpose, denies its very birthright, b y forbiddin g
parenthood.
(a) Our Educational System
Weddings are beautiful in all that they display and
sy m bolize. T w o yo u n g people, selected from am ong all
others, publicly declare their desire and intention to live
and love together, to be, as they b eliev e, eternally
happy. T he con dition s are w holly fav o rab le, it w ould
seem , but so m etim es before the h on eym oon h as w aned,
discord h as begu n to rub the b lo om from their b liss.
T hey thought they knew everything ab ou t m arriage, but
alas! B o th w ere ignorant o f everythin g but their ow n
desire, w hich w as n ot w holly ph ysical.
41
Our educational systems h ave cluttered the m in ds o f
the w orld’ s C reators w ith m uch that w ill n ever b e u sed
in the daily life o f our youn g m an and w ife.
D urin g their p lastic years w hat w ere they tau gh t o f the
facts o f m arriage, o f the m ean s w hereby h ap p in ess m ay
be continued through the life-sp an , o f the w ay in w hich
to k eep love untarnished from m utual fault-fin din g and
b ick erin g? N eith er has been taugh t how m u ch to give
or to w ithhold. N eith er realizes that the disturban ce o f
the once perfect harm ony m ay be found in h im se lf or
h erself. E ach u su ally exp ects too m uch o f the other.
T h e w ife resen ts the cessatio n o f courtship. S h e m isses
the little token s, thoughtful and con siderate, that w ere
lav ish ed upon her before m arriage. W hat the lover
hum bly prayed for, the h usban d claim s as h is right,
regard less o f her com p lex em otion s, her sen sitive
p h y sical organ ism , w hich reacts u n co n scio u sly from
her trem ulous fear that her m ate h as ceased to love her.
W ith w om an love is u su ally far m ore a spiritu al than
a p h ysical thing. Sh e w ants to feel the divin e elem ent
in her h usban d’ s lo v e -sh e w an ts to keep the sex act
ab ov e the plane o f m ere appetite—she w ants to be loved
as an individual, even m ore than as a w om an.
(b) A Typical Picture
The average man is not con cern ed w ith any thing
super-ph ysical in h is relations w ith h is w ife. H is life is
regulated, organized. H e ge ts up in the m orning,
solem n ly con su m es h is b reakfast, already so
preoccu pied w ith the com in g w ork o f the d ay that his
respon se to h is w ife’s tender touch es and caressin g
vo ice is exasperatin gly indifferent. Sh e is alw ay s in the
m o o d for eviden ces o f affection . H e prefers to w ait
until bedtim e. A t evening he com es as an honored
gu est to a brigh tly lighted hom e, a dinner prepared and
a w ife prettily arrayed to p lease him . A ll th ese he
42
accep ts as a m atter o f course, nor d o es he care to hear
ab ou t the little d etails o f her daily w ork.
H e prefers to ta lk about som ethin g w orthw hile--
h im self.
So m etim es she, w eary o f w ash in g d ish es, o f pick in g
u p and putting a w ay h is clothes, and preparin g his
dinner, w ou ld like to go out for the even in g. I f this is
den ied too often, the spontaneity o f her resp o n se to the
m arital act d isap p ears. Sh e b ecom es “ frig id ,” and after
a tim e he teleph on es that he w on ’t be h om e to dinner.
T he fault is not all on the m an ’ s side.
P rob ab ly he thinks h is w ife sh ould kn ow m ore about
coo kin g, perh aps sh e h as never been tau gh t to keep the
h om e tidy or her ton gu e in leash. P erh aps in her first
recoil from the lo ss o f the rom antic quality in their love
sh e h as ceased to k eep h e rself attractive, lo st interest in
tryin g to p lease a m an w ho never n otices w hat she is
w earin g or takes the trouble to p ay her a com plim ent.
B e c a u se she has tim e during her d aily activities about
the h om e to study h is likes and d islik es an d plan for his
w ell bein g, she resen ts the fact that it h as never
occurred to him to stu dy her com p lex ities o f m ood and
p erv ersities o f action.
Then one day co m es to her the m o st su blim e
k n ow ledge that can ever be experien ced by w om an.
Sh e is to becom e a m oth er-th e m oth er o f his child.
A g ain she is overw h elm ed by her love fo r her m ate.
A ll the discord h as flow n before the glo ry o f a holy
A nnunciation. W hen she tells him , he is sp eech less
w ith ecstasy . He is to father a race o f m en w ho shall do
m igh ty deeds!
43
(c ) The Eternal Miracle
For nine months she w aits, com m uning w ith the L ife
that h as been com m itted to her care, realizin g a s never
b efore, her D ivin e M issio n .
H er every thought is a prayer that their child w ill be a
superm an , a great, b eautiful, w onderful hum an bein g.
Sh e w eaves a m ag ic w eb about that gently grow in g
fetu s, a w eb w h ose delicate threads are love, h ope, jo y
and gratitude.
H ap p in ess, harm ony, lo v e surround her.
H is prospective fath erhood m ak es o f the h u sb an d the
m o st devoted and thoughtful o f lovers, all h is protective
in stincts on guard for her safety. Is she not the C h alice,
pure and perfect, the sacred v e sse l to w h ich h as been
entrusted a new E m bodim en t o f the C reative S p irit? So
they dream and plan together, united now by th e D ivin e
L o v e that is free o f the ph y sical need for ex p ressio n ,
realizin g perh aps for the first tim e w hat a h o ly estate a
true M arriage can be and sh ould be. T hey h av e learned
fo r the first tim e w hat L o v e is . . . that L o v e is all­
givin g, all-forgetful o f s e l f . . . that L o v e is G od .
“ L o v e suffereth lon g and is kin d .”
L o v e m ak es ex cu se s for the loved one an d m akes
ligh t o f little fau lts and sh ortcom ings. Love is the
positive force in all human relationships. H o w m uch
need, therefore, is there to keep love untarn ish ed from
faultfin din g, im patience, any o f the m y riad n egative
thoughts that give rise to all the catastroph es that so
frequently destroy or term inate m arriage. W e can love
children, our ow n children, in spite o f their little
n aughty and exasperatin g w ays. It is e a sy to m ake
ex cu se s for them . H ow m uch m ore, then, sh ou ld w e
replace every unkind thought for our life m ate w ith a
lo v in g thought, h ow m uch m ore sh ould sh arp ton gues
b e sm oothed.
(d) The Marriage Act
The marriage act underlies all other relation s betw een
h u sb an d an d w ife. I f the w ife is gen erous w ith her
g ifts, la v ish w ith her charm s, eager to give h ap p in ess to
h im w h om she lo v e s ab ov e all hum an b ein gs, the m an
is h appy in all his relationships. In h is b u sin e ss, he is
q u alified to attain to h is highest ideal o f su c ce ss. H e
rad iates h appin ess an d contentm ent. H e is adm ired,
resp ected b y all h is asso ciates. H e is fu ll o f Pow er to
m ak e o f h is ow n destin y w hatever he w ish es.
The woman whose husband is considerate, w hose
d em an ds are never b eyo n d her ability to respon d, is the
w om an w h ose beauty n ever fad es, w h ose ey es keep the
glin t o f girlhood, w h ose voice rin gs w ith laugh ter and
w h ose attitude tow ards her n eigh b ors is alw ays
friendly, gen erous, an d harm onious. Sh e is the w om an
m en adm ire and other w om en envy. H er h om e is a
p lace to w h ich frien ds are m agn etized b ecau se they find
in its atm osphere that w hich they h ave perh aps failed to
create in their ow n environm ent.
The shrewish woman is she w h ose h usban d sacrifices
h is gen tler instincts to h is brutish love o f pow er and
p o sse ssio n . The m an who is d isagreeab le in his
b u sin e ss life, w ho is unpopular w ith m en and avoided
b y w om en is too often the m an to w h om h is w ife den ies
h erself, o r giv es gru dgin gly as a d istastefu l duty,
regard in g the sacred and beautiful C reative Force
w ithin her m ate and h e rself as “ d isgu stin g.”
45
(e) The Thought Is Everything
“ T h ere’ s nothing either go od or bad, but thinking
m ak es it so .”
M arriage m ay be beautiful or u gly, exactly as w e
think it. L o v e, G od -exp ression w ithin u s, is our
greatest treasure. It is an em otion so subtle that it never
fo rce s itse lf upon us. It is bruised by every n egative
thought, every discordan t reaction tow ards another
h um an bein g. In tim e, it recedes entirely and hides
beh ind the w all that hate too often b uilds, but it never
dies. It cannot die. T he G od w ithin u s can n ot die.
L ik e the tiny flam e o f an altar lam p it b u m s stead ily
even i f dim ly until the enem y is driven ou t and w e
perm it love to flood forth ag ain from our hearts, to shed
its w arm light upon the m ate w e h ave ch osen , our ow n
b elo v ed w ho becom es ever m ore and m ore lovable,
w hen w e learn to see the G od w ithin. L o v e b e g e ts love
and sm iles w in m ore dom estic b attles than tears.
M arriage is whatyou make it.
H ap p in ess never com es from w ithout. N o hum an
b ein g can m ake you happy. Y o u r h appin ess is w ithin
you r ow n Spirit. I f you are out o f harm ony w ith your
m ate, the fault is yours, no m atter w hat the other has
said or done. Y o u have m erely to know that y o u can be
h appy in spite o f w hat is said or done. W hen yo u lift
your ow n con sciou sn ess to a plane w here serenity

S O M E T H I N G is w rong w ith our present m arriage
system . T h at is eviden ced b y the ever in creasin g
num ber o f divorces. I f m arried life w ere all that it
sh ou ld be, divorce w ould be unheard of.
U ntil recently w om en w ere regarded m ain ly as

or else she w ept repentance at the feet o f h er outraged
lord and m aster.
(a) “ Woman's Place Is In the Home ”
M ankin d still burbles this b elief, only to receiv e a
laugh from the w om an that m od em tim es have

Sh e m ak es a hom e for her husban d and fam ily , hires
servan ts to do the drudgery o f househ old clean in g and

c alls her “ ow n” life.
The modern woman has discovered that she has a
Mind. Sh e is learning how to u se her m in d. Sh e is

sputtered their futile discontent, com pelled to accept the

d izzied sen se o f her new pow er to com pete w ith m an in

(b) The Prevalence o fDivorce Increases
W hy is the ratio o f happy m arriages con stan tly on the
d ecrease?
In the days o f our grandm others and their fo rb e ars, a
w ife never m entioned to any other person the secrets o f
the nuptial cham ber. Sh e w ould h ave been h o rrified at
the fran kn ess o f m o d em v irgin s w ho call th in gs by
n am e unblush in gly and probably are clean er in actual
thought for this reason. The old false p rid e that
endured ab u ses w ith sto ical patien ce and th e equally
fa lse m odesty that w as nothing but h y p er-self

T he rapid m ultiplication o f the hum an race and the

sort o f m arital disturbance, fill the unthinking m in ds o f
the m ultitude w ith forebodin g. T h ey fo rg et to look

the divorce court.
(c) Love o fPublicity Leads to Divorce
I f there w ere no n ew sp apers and n ob od y ev er saw
p e o p le ’s ph otographs on the front p age o f th e tab loids,
there w ould not be so m an y divorces. T he lu st fo r the

54
she h as failed . Is he w orth k eepin g? T h en find the w ay
to keep him . T here is only one w ay - L o v e. L o v e
stu d ies h ow to p lease. It never recrim in ates the lover
w h ose ardor h as coo led . Figh ting is for so ld iers, the
lim eligh t is a fever that infects m illio n s o f peo ple w ho
think they think, but never u se their M in d for anything
con stru ctive or b en eficial to their fello w bein gs.
Ignoran t w om en w h ip up in each other a froth o f

tran sg ressio n s o f their husbands. E ach o f them tries to
outdo the other in her tales o f m arital atrocities and the
unw itting sp o u se s fin d “ hell to p ay .”
In m ore d ign ified strata o f so ciety the lure o f the
“ front p a g e ” p lay s an equ ally potent part. . T hat is not
the on ly cau se o f divorce, but it len ds its inducem ents
to affron ted w ives w ho w ant to sh ow up their h u sb an d ’s
in iqu ities outside the hom e.
W om en sh ould rem em ber that men do not go a field
for love if their wives satisfy them!
A n y w om an , m oreover, can keep h er husband, i f she
w ill k eep him in terested in her. T h e French have a
say in g that the w ife w ho is clever en ough to com bine
her h om e-m akin g q u alities w ith the charm s o f a

she h as failed . Is he w orth k eepin g? T hen find the w ay
to k eep him . T here is only one w a y - L o v e. L o v e
stu dies h ow to p lease. It never recrim in ates the lover
w h ose ardor has cooled. Figh ting is for so ld iers, the
d o m estic battle can never be w on w ith a sw ord. It can
alw ay s be w on w ith L o v e, the D ivin e Prin ciple w hich is
u n failin gly ready, unfaltering in su pply, eternally at our

55
(d) What o fthe Erring Wife?
T he m od em love o f pleasu re h as in fected hum an
b ein gs o f all ag es, in all c la sse s o f society. T h e high-
w aged w hite-collar w o rk ers’ w iv es spend la v ish ly for
fur co ats, silk underw ear and diam on ds. T h ey do their

T h ey patronize dance h alls and fa ll for the flattery o f

C ou n tless ex-husban ds are p ay in g exorbitan t su m s to

N u m erou s able-bodied ex-w ives, w h ose se lfish n e ss and

w ith a person m ore w isely chosen. Y o u n g w o m en who

o f d iv orcin g them for the m on ey they w ill be paid.
T H E M A R R IA G E L A W :
H um an b ein gs have a perverse tendency to w ant w hat
they kn ow is forbidden. Forb id a child to steal a cookie
and he prom ptly steals it! M any m en and so m e w om en

each other.
DO they really love each other?
57
I f the truth w ere know n, have they not until n o w loved
the pleasu re they h ave each received from the adoration
o f the other? Is their love o f the sort that is w illin g to

T h o se great h eroic sacrifices, like w ar an d such

CHAPTER EIGHT
PARENTHOOD - ATHING DIVINE
PR O B A B L Y the m ost intense m om ent o f a m an ’ s
life is that in w hich he w aits, an xiou sly , shut out as one
w ho h as no part o r parcel in h is w ife ’ s confinem ent,
alternately v isio n in g the undertaker and the e c stasy o f
h is dream s, to listen at last to the electric w o rd s: “ It’ s a
b o y !”
The girls o fthe world have mostly come unwanted. In
royal fam ilies they are a postpon em en t o f w hat the
kin gdom requires - m ale heirs. In the average
h ouseh old, they are patien tly accepted as the w ill o f
G od, to be potential w ives and m others.
Why are boyspreferable to girls?
In our chapter on glan d s, w e read that the m ale is the
po sitiv e elem ent in hum an life. T he fem ale is the
n egative. T he p o sitiv e elem ent is the dom inant force
that tak es the lead in w orld p rogress. It requires
con jun ction w ith the n egative for perfect functioning
either in the ph y sical act or in the w orld o f
achievem ent; but civilization and all that thereto
pertain s is the ach ievem en t o f m an.
(a) Woman’s Place in the Sun
It required the gen iu s o f J.M . B arrie to tell the w orld
“ W hat E very W om an K n o w s,” that the great
ach ievem en ts o f m en are in spired by, en co u raged by
an d m ade p o ssib le by the w om en they h ave loved.
N o w ad ay s, w om an , stan din g b esid e her m an on the
sam e plan e as an earner o f livelih ood, is in clined to
resent the term “ n egativ e” as applied to her sex. It
61
seem s to carry a certain ignom iny. Sh e is the true
C reator, in w h ose bod y h as m atured their children. T o
her is relegated practically all the trainin g o f the
children in their m ost im p ression ab le years. Is there
anything n egative about that? Sh e ask s. P o sitiv e force
is constructive. Is she, the n egative fo rce , to be
con sidered in such circu m stan ces as d estru ctive,
in asm uch as the tw o p o les are o p p o site?
Negative Is the Complement o fPositive.
Sin ce all the m an ifestation s o f force are e x p re ssio n s
o f the L a w o f O pposites, in a p h y sical sen se a t least, the
n egative is as n ecessary as the p o sitive fo r perfect
functioning. O ne cannot operate w ithout e a c h other.
E ach is equally essen tial to the result. In the m ale body
as in the fem ale, there is the positive sid e and the
n egative side. So m etim es, through the effect o f w rong
thought, the p o sitive side o f the b od y is w eaken ed. It is
the perfect co-ordination o f both that resu lts in a
healthy condition o f the w h ole body. In th is respect
on ly is w om an a n egative force.
D uring the lon g m onths o f pregn an cy th e m other
b u ilds rosy dream s o f ach ievem ent for the ch ild so soon
to com e. T he father con es alon g w ith a totally differen t
program . T hey argue and even quarrel over th eir plan s,
neither o f w hich is likely to be carried o u t by the
youn gster who w ill all too so o n decide u p on h is ow n
career and carry it out, right or w rong, in th e face o f
paren tal tears and threats.
(b) The Mother and Her Children
E ducation literally is a leadin g out from unlettered
ignorance into the sort o f learn in g w hich is largely
con fin ed to books. B o o k s are in valuable in their w ay,
but they do not educate. T h ey do not lead the youn g
m in d out o f the darkness o f its ow n ign oran ce into the
light o f experience. O ur sch o o ls and c o lle g e s prepare
62
their studen ts to enter either b u sin e ss or p ro fessio n al
life, a s a m ean s o f livelihood, or else they su p p ly a
ven eer su ited to so cial idleness.
Modern education does not necessarily educate.
It is the m oth ers to w h om is entrusted the early
edu cation o f children in their pre-sch ool period o f five
or six years, but, gen erally speak in g, m others g iv e little
h eed to the im pression s they are m ak in g upon those
p lastic yo u n g m in ds. M others w ho know nothing o f
self-con trol adm it they can do nothing w ith T o m m y or
M argaret. T h ey tak e the e asie st w ay w hich is over-
in du lgen ce w here restraint is n eeded and b o d ily or
verb al ch astisem en t for som e o ffen se w hich m ay be as
trivial as it is terrifying to the pu zzled offender.
C h ildren h ave a strong sen se o f ju stic e . T h ey do not
kn ow h ow to get b ack at an u n ju st parent, but they
su ffer and rem em ber. Ignorant m oth ers and fath ers
ab u se their po w er over their frail and frightened young.
I f a ch ild d isp lay s a strong w ill they crush it, or attem pt
to. T h ey fail to realize that by explain in g m ore and
h elpin g the child to understand w h y it is better to do
this than that, they w ill receive co-operation. C ertainly
w eak n ess o f w ill is no asset to the adult hum an bein g
their ch ild w ill so o n becom e. D iscip lin e cou pled w ith
ju stic e an d k in d n ess and yoked w ith firm n ess is the
w isest educator.
But there are too many “Don ’ts. ”
T here is too m uch o f forbiddin g, not en ough o f
p ersu ad in g, in the m other’ s part o f her ch ild ’ s
education. N eg atio n is the keyn ote o f her training.
“ D o n ’t do this, d o n ’t do that,” in stead o f - ” L e t’ s do
th is,” or “ try it that w ay.” O ne w ish es som e o f these
destructive n egative w ords cou ld be stricken out o f the
lan gu age.

(c) Teaching Youth About Sex
It is quite right that our you n g people be train ed to
earn a livin g or to grace their state o f so ciety . Y et our
presen t educational sy stem s are upheld b y m oldy
tradition. R eform s never b egin at the fou n dation , they
m erely g lo ss over the top an d leave the fu n dam en tals as
in applicable to the con ditions o f m od em so c io lo g y as
they w ere w hen the great u n iversities o f E u ro p e w ere
estab lish ed , som ew here in the D ark A g e s. O u r young
p eo p le are preparin g fo r love, m arriage, paren thood.
T heir in form ation is u su ally derived from th eir fello w s,
w ho have fa lse and frequen tly filthy in form ation to
d isclo se . Parents are sq u eam ish ly reticen t about
teach in g their children that w hich they m o st n eed to
know . T he sex relationship is still tab oo in polite
education al centers.
And Schools—
they do not always teach!
Youth Is Determined to Know!
T he fran kn ess w ith w hich m o d em youth re g a rd s and
sp e ak s o f thin gs their gran dparen ts never m en tion ed has
c e a se d to be appalling. T here is a reason fo r th eir revolt
from the screen ed ob scen ities and the cov ert in iquities
o f older generations. Sentim en tality h as too lo n g been
overdone, preten se is overthrow n, m od esty stricken out
o f the vocab ulary as a m eretricious falsity. Y o u th is
determ ined to know by experien ce and n ot b y fa lse or
furtive inform ation. T he resu lts o f the G reat W orld
W ar are in calculable. T h is is one o f th em . Its
con seq u en ces can only be surm ised.
E v ery great w ar in history has decim ated the ran ks o f
m en. The m o st perfect specim en s o f youth h av e been
slaughtered to satisfy the greed o f m on arch or
bureaucrats. A fter every great w ar there h a s been a
correspon din g period o f unstinted ex trav ag an ce and
licen tious living. W e have recently p a sse d th rou gh the
m o st d isastro u s w ar in all history. H ow n atu ral, then,
64
that it be fo llo w ed b y years o f lav ish spen din g and its
sex u al com plem en t.
It is not a lo w erin g o f m oral stan dards, as our sterile
n eigh bors w o u ld h ave u s believe, so m uch as it is a
su b co n scio u s effort on the part o f w hat w e call N ature
to replen ish the lo ss o f m illions o f yo u n g m en. N ev er
h as the se x u rge b een as strong or as irresistib le as it has
been during th ese y e ars since the w ar. N ev er h ave m en
and w om en o f m id d le age renew ed or extended their
virility to su ch an astonish in g extent. I f our youn g
people h ave tak en their love affairs into their ow n
hands, it is not fo r their elders to d isap p rov e or
con dem n w h at can n ot be stopped. B etter to let them
kn ow that you stan d by, loving and trustin g, know in g
that they w ill u ltim ately arrive at their true destination.
(d) What o f Companionate M arriage?
N o w ad a y s, no yo u n g m an in h is early tw enties can
earn en ou gh to su pport a w ife. N o you n g w om an is
w illin g to assu m e the drudgery o f po verty even to be
m arried to the m an she loves. Sh e k n ow s w hat that is.
D o e sn ’t sh e rem em ber w hat her m other had to go
through?
N o ! Sh e h as h er jo b and she intends to keep it until
the B o y Frien d can put over that b ig am bition o f his.
Isn ’t it clean er an d finer for them to lo v e honestly and
open ly and faith fu lly, than for the b o y to visit
prostitutes and the girl to becom e n ervous and ill
b ecau se o f entire se x repression ? L o n g en gagem en ts
w ere the cu rse o f precedin g generations. A ll honor to
the C om pan ion ate m arriage, cry m any. T h ey declare
that it is far m ore lik ely to lead to h ap p in ess in ultim ate
m arriage than the o ld system w hich often plun ged an
ignorant girl into the horrors o f u n expected contact,
w ith a d isastro u s p sy ch ic shock. T hey n ow h ave all the
65
fascin atin g risk o f lo sin g each other, an d the sad
n ecessity to be som etim es apart, rather than the sober
b u sin esslik e settling dow n in double h arn ess to plod
through a life that giv es too m uch o f bein g togeth er and
not en ough o f bein g apart.
(e) Birth Control?
In d iv id u als do very little thinking. It has b een stated
that nine-tenths o f the A m erican people m erely think
they think. T heir opinion s are taken from n ew spapers,
pu lp its and soap-b ox orators. I f sexual in du lgen ce be
d egrad ed to an appetite and the com in g o f b ab ies an
u n avoidab le accident, is it to be w ondered that w ith so
m an y unw elcom e b ab ies, there are so m any
u n con gen ial adu lts?
T h e m atter o f B irth C ontrol is one to be d ecid ed by
m utual consent o f any one m an and w om an . In the
S cien ce o f M en talph ysics w e teach the secrets o f birth.
W e h ave too m uch reverence for the L a w o f L ife to
con don e the birth o f unw anted children or to d isco u rage
the birth o f those w h ose com in g w ould brin g jo y to the
paren ts and opportunity to the new em bodim en t o f the
C reative Spirit. In this, a s in all hum an relation sh ips,
there is a happy m ean betw een tw o extrem es. The
con trol o f exorbitant in dividual appetite w o u ld obviate
an y d iscu ssio n as to the m erits o f the m u ch m ooted
B irth Control.
W hen is the soul b o m ? P eople often a sk as they
w atch the developm en t o f an infant.
In M en talph ysics w e kn ow that it never is “ b o m .” It
IS an d alw ay s h as been. T he grow th o f the bod y and
brain gradually en able it to do w hat has b een planned
b efo re the m agnetic instant o f p h ysical con ception .
W hy are so m any m em bers o f a sin gle fam ily so
un like, perhaps none o f them actually resem b lin g either
parent, except p o ssib ly in certain facial ch aracteristics?
66
W e kn ow the an sw er to that, too, but there is not space
here to tell about it. C hildren have m uch to teach
adu lts, w ho have ev er m uch to learn.
(f) Influence o f Children Upon Adults
“ E X C E P T Y E B E C O M E A S L IT T L E C H IL D R E N —
ye sh all in no w ise enter the K in gd o m o f H eaven .” W e
h ave been told by the greatest o f all T each ers, “ T he
K in g d o m o f H eaven is w ithin yo u .” T hen w hat is the
ap p lication o f these tw o statem en ts? L e t u s an alyze.
C hildren live m ostly by their em otion s. T hey feel
keen ly. T h ey think little or not at all. T h ey are alw ay s
jo y o u s.
T h ey b ear no resen tm ent that is perm anent. T h ey are
alw ay s active, alw ay s w anting to grow up to som ething
better, alw ay s truthful, fearless and fu ll o f im agination.
O ften little children d isp lay psy ch ic kn ow ledge that is

literally the K in g d o m o f H eaven, b ecau se each new day

C R O W N o f hum an existen ce.
W A T C H O U R Y O U N G G E N E R A T IO N !
T he youn gsters w ho h ave so sh ock ed their elders are
in u n con scious revolt again st the present m arriage

67
interference from paren ts w ho, they think, cannot

and for fair play. T h ey h ave been trained to a love o f
luxury and pleasure. T h ey scorn respon sibility. Let

C H A P T E R N IN E
LOVE IS THE FULFILLING OF THE LAW
T h e m e ssa g e o f the N azarene is so in terw oven with
the com m an d to love, that even in our basest
interpretation o f h is w ords, w e sh all alw ay s find an
in spiration to live up to them as n early as w e can, to
tend the flam e o f our perpetual altar lam p an d keep it
alight.
L o v e is the Light o f L ife . I f it be d im m ed b y thoughts
o f self-im portan ce, i f it be hidden ben eath doubt,
su spicio n , d isap p rov al and hate, and the ligh t that is
w ithin u s b e darkn ess, how great is that dark n ess!
L et u s an alyze St. P au l’s defin ition o f love,
m istak en ly translated in the T estam en t as “ charity,” and
see h ow truly it erases all our destru ctive n egative
em otion s.
“LOVE SUFFERETH LONG.” It is therefore patient.
“LOVE ENVIETH NOT.”
“LOVE VAUNTETH NOT ITSELF . . . IS NOT PUFFED UP.”
“DOTH NOT BEHAVE ITSELF UNSEEM LY.”
“ SEEKETH N O T HER OWN.”
“IS N OT EA SILY PROVOKED.”
“TH IN K ETH N O EV IL.”
“REJOICETH NOT IN INIQUITY, BUT REJOICETH IN THE
TRUTH.”
W hat m ore can be added?
(a) Influence o fLove in Everyone’s Life
T he Fren ch h ave a proverb: “ T o kn ow everything is
to fo rgiv e everyth in g.” A nd w e think w e know so
m uch about each other! A ll w e k n ow is the little that
w e see an d hear, u pon w hich w e b u ild a Fran ken stein o f
our ow n im agin in g, w hich harm s the hater m ore than
the hated.
69
H av e you ever stopped to study in your ow n body the
differen ce betw een the glorious exh ilaration cau sed by
jo y , the beauty o f your face and the rin gin g m u sic o f
you r laughter, as com pared w ith the p h y sical depletion
cau sed by every unhappy thought? I f yo u are m arried
go b ack to that first year or so an d study the cau ses o f
you r first sym ptom s o f ill health. T he first tim e you
feared that he did not love you, i f you are a w om an , the
first tim e you found her to be ex asperatin gly
un reason able, i f yo u are a m an an d rem em ber how you
dev elop ed a headach e or a b ilio u s attack, or d y spepsia.
I f you kn ow your body as w e do in the Scien ce o f
M en talp h y sics yo u w ill know that every tim e you have
perm itted anything but love to be thought o f or
ex p resse d to your m ate, you h ave ad d ed to the
destructive fo rces that perhaps b y n ow h av e m astered
yo u r body.
W hatever is out o f order in that m o st perfect
instrum ent in the w orld, your b od y, is the resu lt o f your
ow n thought.
“ A s a m an thinketh, so is he.”
It is never too late for thought to repair the dam age
thought m ay h ave com m itted. T hat is the m ost
w onderful thing about this T em ple in w hich dw ells the
Sp irit o f G od. H ow ever m uch y o u m ay , in the darkness
o f your ow n ignorance, have in jured your body, by
perm itting c/A-harm ony and dis-ea.se to tak e p o sse ssio n ,
there is a w ay by w hich you m ay learn to b u ild a perfect
b od y, to recapture the h appin ess o f youth and to
substitute love for every n egative em otion.
(b) Love Is a Magnet
T h e hum an bein g w ho gives m o st freely o f lovin g­
kin d n ess to h is fello w m en and w om en receiv es m ost
from them . It is a scien tific law o f life.
70
T w o fam o u s actre sses w ere once gu ests o f honor at a
b azaar at the old W ald o rf in N ew Y ork. O ne w as a
w o rld -fam ou s beauty, accustom ed to receiv in g the

the crow d stood in speech less adm iration —o f her

her hand co rd ially to this one and that, k issed
everyb od y sh e kn ew and applauded to the lim it.
W hich o f these tw o w a s loved m o st? T he one w ho
receiv ed m o st o f adu lation or the one w ho g a v e m o st o f
lo v e ? T he an sw er is obvious.
We all love to laugh.
C h ildh ood, a rose, the m u sic o f w ind in the forest, the
glory o f sun rise, snow -crow ned p eak s again st the sky,
the tender strength o f a sprouting seed and the m igh t o f

O nly a m an kn ow s w h at jo y he feels in the p resen ce o f
the perfect beauty o f w om an.
Some men see but one thing in woman—
the p o ssib ility
o f pleasure.
(c) Can Physical Love Be Linked With Divine?
B u t all m en are not so. So m e are su fficien tly hum ble
to w on der w hy the gift o f w o m an ’s beau ty and
w o m an ’s lo v e h as been bestow ed on them . T he true
lover fe e ls his ow n unw orthiness, and b o w s in

b est in h im -ch iv a lry , tenderness, d e v o tio n -a re
aw akened. The w om an h as it in her pow er to
perpetuate or to destroy those em otions. S o m e w om en
divine in stinctively how to keep a m an ’ s love unsullied,
others learn through bitter experience; but m an y, alas!
71
p lace S E L F upon the altar o f their devotion and su ffer
the con sequ en ces in b odily m alad y and spiritual
despair.
M an y teachers o f religion , and even in certain m o d em
sch o o ls o f ph ilosoph y, persisten tly differen tiate
betw een hum an and D ivin e love. T he form er they
con dem n as gro ss, selfish , law less, and fick le. T h ese
attributes deserve a b aser n am e, for they are but a
co arse im itation o f w hat w e know love to be.
A s w e have said in a p rev iou s chapter, L o v e is a
syn on ym for G od —” G o d is Love. ” T herefore, there can
be no com prom ise. T he ph y sical ex p ression can be a
sacram en t and is such to those w ho h ave attained to the
h igh est con sciou sn ess. I f it be le ss than that, the fault is
in the one w ho lo ves and not in the love that is bein g
ex p ressed .
(d) Human and Divine Are One
A ll students in the Scien ce o f M en talp h y sics know
ou r divine origin and our place in the U n iverse. W e
learn it scien tifically. W e kn ow the hum an to be a
differen tiated fragm ent o f the O ne D ivin e P rin ciple, and
therefore w e kn ow that the one perfect ex p ressio n o f
our Infinite C reative Pow er is and alw ay s w ill be
L O V E , b ecau se there can b e no substitute, no
com prom ise, no escap e from the fact that w e are w hat
w e are, the C reator in hum an form .
A g ain the teach in gs o f the C h rist com e to m ind:
“This is my commandment, thatye
love one another. ”
“God is Love and every one that loveth
is born of God. ”
