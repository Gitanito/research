 This was intended to be the companion of Ghost and was ti be published by the same principals in alternate months.  Ghosts was abandoned after its first issue and was merged into this journal, which appeared monthly.  Magic was primarily devoted to stage magic but attempted to include a rational presentation of spiritualism, occultism and magic from a historical perspective.  The journal’s first issue said that it "is intended to create a wider and more intelligent interest in a most attractive subject — to make more appreciative audiences for magical entertainers, and new devotees of a fascinating hobby."   Contributions by Henry Ridgely Evans and Harry Houdini.  On the "twin" journal, see the note under Ghosts.  Brown University; Newberry Library.     Issues:Magic V1-V2 1910-1911        </p>
