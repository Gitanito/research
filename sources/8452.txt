  Editorial Review:
  Quantum physicists study the nature of light. The Bible speaks of light when   talking about God. Near-death experiences describe going to a light that is   welcoming, intelligent, and loving. Strangest of all, however, is the similarity   of all these descriptions of the nature, presence, and behavior of light to   descriptions of God. Could it be that light and God are one and the same?   Physician Lee Baumann makes a case for exactly that. From many sources, Dr.   Baumann has synthesized a compelling   picture of what may be the true nature of our universe at all levels - physical,   mental, and spiritual.
