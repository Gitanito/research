  		              		Experience Description   

  I lived a different life during my time in the coma. I came very close to death. Even though I was only in the coma for a little over two weeks, it seemed like a lifetime of experiences. When I came out of the coma and to this day, I miss the people and places that I loved in that life. The emotions felt were incredibly intense. I have trouble dealing with the absence to this very day. There is a lot more detail but as I said, it was a lifetime of experiences and many chapters to the story. Only two  times during this experience did I feel fear.

After the NDE:
