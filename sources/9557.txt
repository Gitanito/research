The 'kiddie pool' was full of bugs and I wanted to swim, my mother told me I could go in the big pool as long as I stayed on the edge.  My older brother was swimming in the big pool and was playing with a toy boat.  The boat drifted to deeper end of the pool, and I decided to try to retrieve it.  As I made my attempt to swim to the boat, I soon discovered that I was unable to stay on top of the water.  I felt myself move below the surface, and suddenly saw myself outside of my body, and watched as my little self was slowly sinking to the bottom of the pool.


The most incredible feeling of calm was very present.  I felt myself drift gently away from my body and there was no fear, and no pain.  A blanket of warmth was with me.


I saw my father take his shirt off and dive into the water.


I do not remember being pulled from the water, the next thing I knew, I was lying on the cement beside the pool and being resuscitated.  I am not one hundred percent positive if this was 'death', but I am certain that I was not afraid.


In the years to follow, I would show my defiance of the teachings of the Jehovah's Witness' and embark on my own spiritual path.  I retain a strong measure of the peace that I experienced that day.  I long for home, and for the many joys that await us as we continue our eternal journey.
