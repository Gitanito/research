  		              		Experience Description   

    There was a swimming pool built at the end of the yard within the walls of the newly built house. I talked my 6’4”mentally-retarded cousin to go swimming with me even though I was not allowed to go into the pool without an adult. I was pushing off the sides of the pool, demonstrating to my cousin that I knew how to swim. At one point, I didn’t push off the side of the pool hard enough causing me get stuck face down in the middle of the pool. I struggled for a short amount of time and swallowed one gulp of water. I remember making a conscious decision to not drink anymore water. When I shut my mouth and nose,  I passed out.

   Instantly, I found myself standing on the side of the pool and looking at myself facedown in the water. I was not moving.  My  cousin was standing behind me to watch the trick I told him I could do. I was completely at peace and had, what I would describe as, a better-than-bird's-eye view. I remember my attention being drawn towards the sky. When I looked up, I knew there were many different places I could go exploring. Even though I wanted to go, I looked back at my body and realized I needed help. I went through the yard looking for someone to help me. My feet were floating above the ground. I found it odd that there was nobody around because there usually were plenty of people around and  it was broad daylight.

    I went into the ground floor of the main house and straight into the cook's room. I saw the cook asleep on his stomach in his bed in his very small bedroom. The back of his head was facing me.  I was floating against the wall at the foot of his bed. I screamed for him in a panic, but the words that came out - it was energy. That same instant, he startled me because he jumped out of the bed and ran out of the room. He made it to the threshold of the door that led to the yard. He fell to a sitting position with his hands on his head. I stayed next to him until I saw him look up and towards where my body was in the pool. When I saw him get up and run towards the pool, I followed but got there before him. I went right back to where I originally showed up when I first left my body. When he got to the pool, I was facing him and on the opposite side of the pool. I saw him teetering on the edge of the pool trying to reach me without jumping in. I then went back into my body. 

   I threw my hand up to him and he was able to grab my arm. He pulled me out of the pool. I didn’t cry, cough, throw up, or speak for the rest of the day. I only moved from the spot that I was last put in if I was led by someone to a new spot. I was in a state of total peace like I’ve never known before that moment and never known since. I remember every detail of that moment to this day, even though I can’t not remember anything else before or after that moment with that kind of  detail. I remember the cook leading me back towards the main house and calling to several other people to join him so he could explain what just happened. He said he had just fallen asleep; when suddenly, he felt like the room exploded and he jumped out of bed so shaken that he barely made it to the threshold of the door before he had to sit down. As he was trying to figure out what had just happened. That’s when he saw clothes hanging on the rebar that was still exposed near the swimming pool. He said he knew I was in the pool and went running to find me. He said, as tears ran down his cheeks, 'She wasn’t moving. I thought she was gone!' I never talked about what I saw until I was in my late teens and most people were dismissive of my story. I started researching other accounts to compare my experience when I was in my 20's but never found an exact account like mine.
