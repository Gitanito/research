  		              		Experience Description:   

    I visited 'the light' during a clinical hypnosis session early last year.  I was not seeking any kind of spiritual experience. It was the 'home' described in so many NDE accounts. I saw vibrant colors and felt a completely overwhelming feeling of love and belonging. I was met by my spirit guide and overjoyed to be reunited with him. I had no desire whatsoever to leave, but he communicated that I should enjoy my visit but I 'must go back and focus on [my] work.' I was sad and frustrated but didn’t question that I had a duty to follow through on my 'work.' So when my session ended, I returned.
  
  Several weeks later, I was in a toxic situation at work. I’d been putting in an insane number of hours and enduring long periods of extreme pressure and stress.  I suffered an adrenal crisis leading to sudden cardiac arrest. Although  under a doctor’s care, I was home in bed at the time of the cardiac arrest. I was in and out of consciousness when I suddenly became very aware of my slowing heart rate and final breaths. Then, I was just gone. 
  
  I immediately found myself in a dark room or tunnel of some sort. I know it should seem odd that I wasn’t confused by this new environment after having gone into the light before. But somehow, I understood that I was in an in-between space. The only sensation I felt was an extreme heaviness, like being engulfed in an incredibly dense, dark fog.
  
  I was surrounded by shadowy beings that I couldn’t quite see.  I  focused on the one I could see most clearly. She was a tall woman. I felt some connection to her, but didn’t recognize her as anyone I know from this life. I felt as loved and supported as I had in the light, but there was also another feeling here. I was absolutely not supposed to be here, and I felt a strong sense of alarm and concern.
  
  I proceeded to have a telepathic conversation with a presence I couldn’t see but knew to be 'God' or maybe another guide. I understood that I had died but had the choice to go back. I immediately decided to accept my death. I was then made to feel the pain that my family would feel over my death. It was a crushing feeling, and to this day, I still cry every time I relive that experience. I then contemplated choosing to live, but I didn’t understand how I was supposed to return when my body was so broken. I reasoned that my family would be sad but, eventually, they would be OK. I was then shown an image of my young niece, which was the one thing that could persuade me to continue this life. I don’t even remember it being a decision at that point. In what seemed like an instant, I agreed to return and went right back into my body. I remember popping up into a sitting position in my bed, taking an enormous, deep breath, and then flopping back down and sleeping for four days straight.
  
  Physically, it has been  a year to get back to about 80% wellness. The mental piece has been an especially wild ride. I’m thankful to have both gone into and emerged from this with my mental health. But not even the most solid foundation or a prior spiritual experience can prepare one for a true NDE. The combination of the physical and mental experiences left me feeling like the walking dead for several months.  It was  like I was just existing somewhere between the physical and spirit worlds. I’m only now starting to feel like I’m fully reconnected to this life and successfully integrating my new reality.
  
  I’m still not quite ready to share this with anyone I know, so my personal relationships are mostly unchanged. But I do sometimes feel frustrated and isolated, having had this life-changing experience that I can’t talk about. The shift in perspective and knowledge of the universe that I gained from both visits to the other side have been hugely positive for me. I like to think I was always a good, kind, and mindful person. That hasn’t changed, but I’m more patient with others now and I take less for granted. 
  
  While neither my visit with my spirit guide nor my NDE specified the nature of my 'work' here, they did leave me open to constant communication with the other side which has  helped me to better understand my life path and mission. Although I was left with a constant sense of longing for 'my home' and 'my people,' I now know that I am part of something much larger than the here and now. I have an important purpose in being here, as we all do, and I’m committed to staying until I’m no longer needed.

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       My vision was about the same as my everyday vision.

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes     I was surrounded by beings I didn’t recognize.

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Unaffiliated- Agnostic   Raised Lutheran but not affiliated since childhood  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I meditate more. I’m more aware of signs and messages from the other side.  

What is your religion now?         Other faiths- New age   Spiritual but not religious  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience       

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.    I had a telepathic discussion with a higher being I could not see. This being persuaded me to return to this life.  
  
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     I took my sense of remembering this place and these processes as awareness that I’d had these experiences before. It was like I was in the foyer of my long-lost home but forced back outside rather than being invited in.  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I felt connected to the beings who surrounded me even though I couldn’t see their faces clearly or recognize their faces. The sense of oneness is hard to express in words.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Uncertain     I knew the being I was communicating with was a higher being. The other beings surrounding me seemed to be listening and waiting for the outcome of our discussion, in a way that seemed deferential to the higher being.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   Previously described. I have a purpose or mission that required me to return, but I wasn’t given any specifics.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     Only that I do have one, which is important enough that I was persuaded to return rather than being allowed to pass as I wished.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     I felt my last breath and heartbeat and immediately regained consciousness in the void/tunnel. I went on to have a discussion with a higher being and debated my choice to live or die. This would not have been possible if I’d ceased to exist when my heart stopped.  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life       

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I feel a distance from friends and family, like I’m not the same person I was before and my perspectives and priorities have changed, so I don’t always connect with them the same way I used to. I’m really struggling with my career, as my expanded perspective doesn’t allow me to conform to the corporate world.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It’s difficult to express the form of telepathy or 'knowing' I experienced when communicating with the other beings, and the feeling of being botha connected to but beyond my physical body.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience    

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I’ve received specific information in my sleep that I have no Earthly knowledge of or connection to (names of people and places); lucid dreams that impart wisdom I would never have imagined while awake.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          All of it helped me better understand prior experiences I’ve had but never made any sense of.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    A year. I’ve only shared anonymously in an online forum and with one non-family/non-friend spiritual advisor. People online seem hungry for NDE stories to help them cope with the concept of death, which makes me reluctant to share in a time when so many are struggling and suicide rates are climbing. The advisor was very accepting and helped me to understand that many others have had similar experiences.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably real.     I knew it was real but couldn’t cope with the enormity of it. I had to heal physically and get back to work and my day-to-day life to avoid losing my job and upsetting family and friends, so I kind of denied or compartmentalized it for a long time.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I always knew it was real and finally allowed myself to accept it.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   As described in my complete story, I visited the light and met a spirit guide during a prior hypnosis session.
