&nbsp;

II.&nbsp;  Four  Types of Near-Death Experiences (according to P.M.H. Atwater in Beyond the Light)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A.&nbsp;  Initial Experience</font>  A.&nbsp;  Initial Experience</span></b>--(non-experience)--involves elements such  as a loving nothingness--usually experienced  by those who seem to need the least amount of evidence for proof of  survival.&nbsp;  It often becomes a seed experience or an introduction to  other ways of perceiving reality

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  B.&nbsp;  Unpleasant and/or Hell-like Experience </font>  B.&nbsp;  Unpleasant and/or Hell-like Experience  </span></b>(inner cleansing and self-  confrontation)--an encounter with a threatening void  or stark limbo or hellish purgatory, sometimes hauntings from one's past. Usually experienced by those who seem to  have deeply  suppressed or repressed guilts, fears, and angers.&nbsp;  Many seem to expect punishment after death.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  C.&nbsp;  Pleasant and/or Heaven-like Experience  (reassurance and self-  validation)--a heaven-like  scenario of loving family reunions, reassuring religious figures, figures  or light beings.--seems to be a validation that life counts, it is affirmative  toward life after death.&nbsp;  Usually experienced by those who most need  to know how loved they  are and how important life is.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  D . &nbsp; Transcendent Experience (expansive  revelations, alternate realities)--an exposure to  otherworldly dimensions and scenes beyond the individual's frame of  reference--seldom personal in  content.&nbsp;  Usually experienced by those  who are ready for a mind-stretching  challenge.                           &nbsp; Heaven-Like Cases&nbsp;</font> Heaven-Like Cases&nbsp;            Hell-Like  Cases                     Friendly  beings         Lifeless or threatening           </font>                    apparitions                     Beautiful,  lovely environments         Barren or ugly          expanse                     Conversations  and dialogue         Threats,  screams,   silence                     Total  acceptance and an overwhelming sensation of love          Danger  and the possibility of violence and/or torture                     A  feeling of warmth and a sense of heaven </font>        A feeling of cold (or of          temperature extremes), and a sense of hell </span>

III.&nbsp;  The Psychological  Aftereffects of the Near-Death Experiences:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A.&nbsp;  The inability to personalize love and a  sense of belonging. &nbsp;  Survivors came to love and accept others without the  usual attachments and conditions society expects.&nbsp;  Their desire seems to be that of a conduit  of universal love--God's love.&nbsp;  Family  members see this reaction as being threatening, aloof, uncaring, and  unresponsive.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  B.&nbsp;  The inability to recognize and comprehend  boundaries, rules, limits .&nbsp;  The  survivor has a basis of comparison unknown before.&nbsp;  They have such open acceptance that  they can take on a childlike naivete.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  C.&nbsp;  Difficulty in understanding time sense or  references either to the  future  or the past.&nbsp;  Survivors tend to have a sense of  timelessness--some even reject wearing watches and ignore schedules.&nbsp;  They seem to want to flow with the events.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  D.&nbsp;  Sensitivities enhance and expand, the  intuitive opens up to the  psychic.&nbsp;  To many survivors, it seems that ESP becomes normal and  ordinary.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  E.&nbsp;  A changed view of physical reality, with a  noticeable reduction in worries and fears.&nbsp;  To some, life paradoxes begin to  make sense and a sense of purpose and meaning develop.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  F.&nbsp;  A different feeling of physical self,  knowing we live in and wear our  bodies.&nbsp;  Many will come to regard  themselves as an immortal soul currently residing in a mortal form.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  G.&nbsp;  Difficulty with communications and  relationships, finding it hard to say what  is meant or to understand the words of others. &nbsp;  What was once foreign becomes familiar, what was once familiar becomes  foreign.

IV.&nbsp;  Role Reversals as a Result  of an NDE:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A.  Females generally become more assertive and outspoken afterward; men more thoughtful,  caring, and emotionally expressive.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  B.&nbsp;  Men were less willing than women to view an  unpleasant and/or hell-like scenario in a positive fashion and take steps to  make constructive changes in their lives because of it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  C.&nbsp;  More men reported lengthy and complex  transcendent experiences than women, yet that fact  is not representative of the aftereffects nor what the individual did about  what had happened to him or her.

V.&nbsp;  The Most Common Negative  Reactions From Near-Death Experiences:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A.&nbsp;  Anger--for  having been revived and forced to leave wherever they were.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  B.&nbsp;  Guilt-ridden--for  not missing or even being concerned about their loved ones.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  C.&nbsp;  Disappointed--at  discovering they are once again encased in their physical bodies and they will have to breathe, eat, etc.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  D.&nbsp;  Horrified--if  their experience was frightening or hellish or unpleasant.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  E.&nbsp;  Dumbfounded--if  they want to talk but can't or are afraid to.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  F.  &nbsp; Depressed--at realizing they must now resume their former  lives, that they must find a way to go on with regular living  regardless of what happened to them.

VI.&nbsp;  The Most Common Positive  Reactions From Near-Death Experiences:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A.&nbsp;  Ecstatic--at  the wonder and beauty and glory of it all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  B.  Thrilled--because they feel so  privileged to have experienced such a miracle.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  C.&nbsp;  Grateful--that  anything so incredible could have happened to them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  D.&nbsp;  In  Awe--possibly unable to speak or find words.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  E.&nbsp;   Evangelistic--immediately desirous of telling others the good news  about death and God and the power of love.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  F.&nbsp;  Humbled--by  the magnitude of the incident and what it may portend.
