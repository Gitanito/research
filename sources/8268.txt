Though I felt nothing, I just remember rising up. There was a brilliant sun, giving me a special, soft, warmth, which did not burn me. I could hear beautiful music and I could see birds flying beside me, it was an incredible peace, something extraordinary; I had never felt this before, it was a beautiful feeling, and I didn't want to come back.

My friend says I fell to the ground and became cold (we were on the resting-stage of the descent), and some people surrounded me and tried to resuscitate me. I was as if dead, and my friend was shouting to me, talking, and crying, for about three minutes, and she shouted so much that I woke up as if nothing had happened. I felt nothing (bad), on the contrary, I was still trying to hear the lovely music, which was gone, nor could I see birds flying. I was in mild shock, and went to the clinic where the doctor said that my breakfast had not agreed with me that day, nothing more.
