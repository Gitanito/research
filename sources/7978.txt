A car pull up along the side of me and a mask guy got out. The only thing I could see was his blue eyes as he put the gun to my head for about thirty seconds.  I told him, 'if you're gonna shoot, go ahead. What you waiting for.' Then all I see is the fire from the barrel of the gun. I didn't feel my body hit the ground. 

All I know was that I was back in front of my house standing on the porch.  It was dark and so quiet.  Never in my life had I seen and then heard a little girl's voice from across the street.  It was like she was in my head telling me,  'Daddy let's go home now.  I said, 'no.'  She said it again,  'Daddy let's go home.' I said, 'no' again.  She said, 'Daddy let's go home,' for a third time. I replied, 'No. 

I was back in my body the guy was still standing above me and shooting me.  He ran to the car and got in.  He looked back at me.  I could see it in his eyes as I was raising up looking back at him.  He shot at me one more time and drove off.  I believe someone divine was wathcing over me.  The doctors couldn't believe how the bullets were curving around my neck, missing my throat, spine, and head.
