    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Mas Alla del Manana, El.
 Organo del Centro "Amor, Paz y Caridad".
 1936  Monthly
 Aguilas, Murcia, Spain.  Language:  Spanish.  Editor: Juan Antonio Romero, founder ("En la vida Espiritual"); Andres Fuster, ed.
 1/1, January 1936.  4 pp., 0.15 pesetas a year in Aguilas, 0.20 in the rest of Spain, and 0.25 elsewhere.

 This was the organ of the spiritist center "Amor, Paz y Caridad," in Aguilas, and is distinguished from the usual run of such journals by its religious tone and by the direct involvement of the spirits.  The masthead bears the name of the founder and adds "el la vida espiritual," and much of the content of the single surviving appears  under the name of "Un Espiritu que desea nuestro progreso."   BNE.      Issues:Mas Alla del Manana V1 N1 Apr 1936        </p>
