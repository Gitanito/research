The First Letter of Transmittal
Dear Friend:
Here is The Revelation Secret. It is a gilt I bring
to you.
“A gift?” you say. “Why I sent you a dollar to pay
for it.”
It is true that you sent a dollar, but that was to
pay for creating this book, for writing it, printing it,
preparing it, advertising it and sending it to you. Under­
stand this well, no man can pay for Revelation. The
secret is here. It is yours to get—without further cost
to you. If you get it, it can mean to you thousands of
dollars, yes, tens of thousands, or more. If you fail to
get it now—you still have the book and some day, it
you follow its directions, some day understanding will
come to you—and the secret will be yours.
You have paid for the material book and it is yours.
You have not and CANNOT pay for Revelajjpn. That
is the gift. It is hidden in these pages for you to find
and to use and to know. Health, Wealth and Prosperity
can be yours ever afterwards if you do. All you need
do to get understanding, is use this book. Every word
in it has been weighed. Every word in it is meant
Every word in it is sincere and true. Use it; not for 5
days or 10 days or •any particular number of days, but
until you get results. Then you too will' have the gift.
To keep, forever and ever.
Many have found it and have been overjoyed. Appre­
ciation of it is necessary if you are to keep it and continue
to get results from it. “Be not lacking in appreciation for
there is great joy to be found therein.”
Many people are showing their appreciation by send­
ing this book to others. To friends, relatives or acquaint­
ances whom they wish to see get ahead. That is an ex­
cellent way to show YOUR appreciation and to find the
joy therein. You too, in this way can give the gift.
You who purchase this book may have felt all your
fife that there was something you were seeking, a some­
thing within you that was unsatisfied. Then came a day
when you decided to, get this book. That decision can
easily result in changing all the rest of your life for the
better. I congratulate you on your decision to take this
action to better yourself._ May this book mean the end­
ing of your quest—
may it put your feet on the path' to
peace profound. May it mean the beginning of a new
■The Revelation Secret
era in your existence, so that from this time forward you
will receive more and more of the heritage that is yours
for the claiming. You have tasted some of life’s sweets
and no doubt you have tasted some of life’s bitterness.
It is easy to find those ready to share in our happiness
but so few to share our worries.
Have you ever longed for someone that you could
talk your problems over with, as frankly as you could
talk to yourself about them? Have you ever felt that some­
where in the world there was someone who could help
you in your problems and whose friendship would bring
aid, inspiration and a guiding light? The average man
or woman, even of considerable education does not always
have the knowledge and experience necessary to bring
immediate relief. Knowledge and experience becomes a
POWER.
Since pre-biblical times, in all races, there were al­
ways certain men who were students of principles of
native which gave man the power to master the condi­
tions he was confronted with. They were called “Wise
Men” and were honored, respected and beloved. The
superstitious gave them credit for having super-natural
powers. Thinking people know they were in possession
of nothing more unusual than an understanding of
human-kind and nature’s laws.
Koran-ology is attempting to offer direct and prac­
tical advice and guidance, freed of every semblance of
superstition. Your intelligent co-operation will permit a
better application of our findings in advising you what
you should or should not do to solve your problems. Wise
advice is more valuable than probable predictions, as it
gives you the means to do something about your future.
For the best results—don’t skip through this book
reading a little here and a little there. Start with the
seal on the front cover and read every word carefully on
each page in the order they are prepared for you. Re­
member you are the one to benefit. You have the secret
in your hands—in this book—don’t let it escape you.
Ally yourself with us—feel that we have a friendly
interest in you and whether you are rich or poor, young
or old, a success or a failure, know that we are ready to
do all within our power to assist you.
Yours in Sincere Fellowship,
THE MAYANS

THE REVELATION
SECRET
BOOK ONE
GETTING WHAT YOU WANT
. . What thou secst write in a book and send it
to the seven churches. .
Revelation 1:11.
It is not our purpose to draw members
from any church or creed. Devout followers
of any religion, if they will, can find the
same satisfaction within their sect that any
new creed can offer. The same comfort
and joy.
We do not even insist that the reader be
of the Christian faith. Modern psychology
is discovering the truth of these principles
and proving them scientifically. If all re­
ligious references were left out of this book,
the principle and directions we give you
would still work. We stress the sayings of
Christ— not because he was divine, but be­
cause he was the greatest living exponent of
these principles. We give you these teach­
ings as part of a system for living, not be­
cause they are in the Gospel—but because
they are eternal TRU TH .
The Revelation Secret
W hy do we call it The Revelation Secret?
Because a mere reading of these words, once
or twice will not suffice to reveal the secret
to you. The directions given here must be
practiced— the book read again and again—
in all your different moods— before complete
revelation comes. The secret cannot be
given to you in full. It cannot be written,
nor sung, nor spoken. It must be slowly
revealed in practice. It will be revealed to
you sooner or later if you follow these simple
directions. Then you will truly be, the
master of your destiny.
The first understanding you must gain is
this. In all His teachings, in every utterance
that is recorded, Christ meant exactly what
He said.
For nearly two thousand years, men have
“interpreted” and changed His words into
their own understanding. Or, have refused
to believe His meaning was exactly what His
words implied. The promise was too glor­
ious for their minds to receive. Does it
sound to you as though Christ was in earn­
est when He said:
“Verily, verily, I say unto you.
He that believeth on me
The works that I do shall he do also
and Greater works than these shall he do.”
John 14:12.
The Revelation Secret
When Christ uttered those words nearly
two thousand years ago— He meant exactly
what he said. The words are simple, plain-
spoken, easy to understand— they have not
been misquoted. Yet most all of mankind
has passed them by, refusing to believe that
such a glorious promise could be fulfilled in
himself.
Modern psychology is beginning to per­
ceive their truth. The race of man search­
ing for the gold of understanding has passed
up this clear statement. Even the devout,
usually, believe that He meant someone else,
not themselves, or that He meant sometime
in the future, not now, or in some other
form of life to come, instead of in our pre­
sent physical form.
“Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the
words of prophecy, and keep the things therein, for
the time is at hand."
Revelation 1:3.
This book is to go forth to all who send
for it. T o all classes and to all creeds alike.
T o Mohammedan or Hindu, to Christian or
Atheist, to the Honest or the Dishonest. All
are spiritual brothers, and regardless of belief
or disbelief all who apply this teaching will
be benefited by it.
It is human nature of a sort to try to get
the better of a bargain. Some who have
sent for this book have tried to take advan­
tage of our liberal refund policy. They
have read the book a few times and imagin­
ing that they were in possession of its full
secret have returned it to us for refund. The
The Revelation Secret
secret in this book must come to you by
revelation through use. If you use this prin­
ciple you will not want your money back.
Instead, the chances are, as your wishes are
fulfilled, you will voluntarily send more
money as a free-will offering. Many buy
extra copies to give to friends.
One lady, who lives very much in the
material world, sent her order for a copy of
this book. She read it, saw that it was
good and wanted to use its teachings and
not pay for them. So she copied it. Word
for word, she wrote it down and within
five days returned the book we sent her,
asking for her mopey back. Under our
liberal policy we gave it to her. But she
only cheated herself. The principle would
not work for her. She could not possibly
make it work. A psychologist could tell
her why. So could a religionist. We knew,
but could not tell her, why all her efforts
were in vain, We knew that she had only
cheated herself out of a glorious opportunity
to improve all the rest of her days. If she
did not pay her just debt— she could not
receive the revelation in full. She could not
practice it and make it work. She had never
heard the following promise:
"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure,
pressed down, shaken together, running over."
Luke 6:38.
Let it be explained here, that you are not
expected to get results within five days. Nor
is it possible to guarantee that you will.
The Revelation Secret
Results depend on you following the direc­
tions. Revealment sometimes comes slowly,
Do not think that the full richness of abun­
dant life will come to you instantaneously.
It won’t. The five days trial is to give you
a full opportunity to realize how much this
can mean to you in practice.
W ithin less than that time you should
be transformed through renewal of your
mind, through the establishment of your
thoughts, and all good will begin to flow
to you. But it will be regulated by growth.
All life is growth; and in the unfoldment
of the abundant life, we see this law operat­
ing in its highest form. Your growth has
already started. The seed was planted when
you first sent for this book W ith your
first reading of it— the seed sprouted and
began to grow. Practice the teachings of this
book— nurture it by reading it again and
again and the plant will come into full
bloom. Whenever you are depressed or in
need, a careful re-reading of it will help you.
This book itself is part of the mystery.
You will never be able to forget it complete­
ly. You can burn it, destroy it, or refuse to
believe its promise— yet its words will re­
main with you in part. It will become
part of your thoughts. You may even try
to forget it entirely. Yet the harder you
try to forget it— the more parts of it will
“itch in your mind,” until sooner or later
you will use it. And to the extent that you
use it— and to that extent only— will you
receive— Revelation.
The Revelation Secret
This book, as stated before, is to go to
all who send for it. It has been received
with acclaim by people of all races, classes
and creeds. Five editions were exhausted in
the first seven weeks it was placed on sale.
Testimonials have literally poured in from
delighted purchasers. Those who use it say
they are uplifted, inspired and benefited by
it. It can do the same for you if you will
just open your heart and let its message pour
in. D o not read it hurriedly, or judge it by
materialistic standards lest you miss a great
opportunity.
The book is made small with purpose,
and only by great effort. It would be
easier to write a longer book. It has been
kept small to make it easier to re-read it.
The first reading may inspire you— but only
later readings— and re-readings will reveal
to you the fullness of its message. Don't
judge any book's value by its size.
T o those who may be opposed to religion
let me explain, I do not intend to expound
dogma, nor to compare one creed with an­
other. Most certainly I have no political
purpose. I ask only that you open your
heart and mind, to search and see if there
may not be, a great wealth revealed herein.
For who has not heard the true story of
the poor Boer farmer who struggled many
years to get a bare living out of his rocky
soil. Finally he gave it up in despair and
went off to seek his fortune in a better place.
Many years later, he returned to his old
farm, to find it swarming with men and
•The Revelation Secret
machinery. He found there was more
wealth being dug out of it every day, than
he would have believed existed. His farm
was now the great Kimberley Diamond
Mine. The farm he had thought worthless
was literally acres of diamonds. The Kim­
berley Mines are still producing today.
Those who live near Oklahoma City
know that oil has been discovered within
the past few months right in the city. People
lived over vast reservoirs of black gold for
years without dreaming of its presence.
The same thing has happened in Long
Beach, California and many other places.
Thousands have passed up pure gold, not
seeing it— because they didn't think to look.
Don’t let that happen to you— this book is
a gold-mine— for those who will mine the
gold.
Let us give two quotations here and ask
you which You would honestly rather be,
the material man, or the believer in things
to come, the spiritual man.
“A material man will not accept what the Spirit of
God offers. It seems mere folly to him, and he can­
not understand it, because it takes spiritual insight to
see its true value, but the spiritual man is alive to
all true values;— but his ozvn true value no unspirit­
ual man can see."
(Goodspeed Translation.)
I Corinthians 2:14, IS.
Now compare the narrow limitations of
the blind materialistic man to the happy
philosophy of the spiritually aware man, as
The Revelation Secret■
expressed in the following poem by Edgar
A. Guest.
"Somebody said that it couldn’t be done,
But he with a chuckle replied
That ‘maybe it couldn't,' but he would be one
Who wouldn’t say so till he’d tried.
So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin
On his face. I f he worried he hid it.
He started to sing as he tackled the thing
That couldn’t be done, and he did it.”

Revelation I .
FULFILLING YOUR
WISHES
Here is a result getting plan, dear cut and concise,
with rules and suggestions for improving your con­
dition and enjoyment of life.
The house you are now in, was once just
a wish in someone's mind. T hat person
wished to have a house such as this. Wish­
ing alone did not materialize the house, but
wishing did bring about the conception of
it. As the wish grew and was intensified,
that person caused material to be brought
and labor to be expended, and so brought
the house into being. Everything that has
being follows this formulae. First— you
must know what you want. Second— you
must have faith that it is possible. Third
— you must want it intensely enough to be
willing to expend effort, try, strive and if
necessary sacrifice to that end.
There are three powers within you that properly
understood and properly directed can, like the Genie
of Aladdin's lamb, bring you anything that you wish
for. They are—
!
The Revelation Secret
The Power of Desire which is of the body.
The Power of Faith which is of the soul.
The Power of Will which is of the spirit.
As you gaze upon the marvelous resources
of all of nature, you must realize that here
is overwhelming evidence of a Supreme Be­
ing. The most skeptical person you know,
if he thinks, must be convinced that all this
material universe came into being somehow.
Even he must see the evidence of the Creator.
A Creator, magnificent enough to create
all that we can know of Creation, must be
powerful enough to fulfill our puny desires.
The fact that creation continues to exist is
evidence of that, for this whole life, on the
physical plane is only— Desire.
The wild beast desires food. Does he
worry and doubt that he shall get it? Does
he deny himself saying “It is not for me?”
No, he uses Power of Will. He thinks, “I
desire food— I will get it.” He has faith
that there is food to be had, and he hunts
for it and finds it. If he had no faith he
would not have the will to hunt and his
desire would be useless to him. He would
soon perish.
We are all familiar with what naturalists
term “protective coloring” in wild life. That
which man tried to imitate during the late
war, and called “camouflage.”
It is simply a coloring which birds and
beasts develop that enables them to so blend
The Revelation Secret
with their habitual surroundings that they
are practically invisible to their natural ene­
mies. Naturalists point out that all pro­
tective coloring is developed. T hat once the
specie did not possess this ability to become
almost invisible. Once, the animal was vis­
ible to his enemies. It is easy to imagine an
animal fleeing for his life, wishing that his
enemy could not see him, wishing that he
could fade into his surroundings and become
invisible.
As this experience was common to many
generations— “protective coloring’’ gradual­
ly developed in accordance to this intensive
often repeated wish. Science tells of a mys­
terious substance within our body called
‘Genes.’ This substance is transmitted
to our off-spring, and governs the nature
of it. It is the means by which a
child receives “inherited characteristics’’ from
its parents. It is the means by which a rose­
bush produces roses of a certain kind and
distinguished from all other roses. It is the
means by which a mouse produces mice and
not cats, or a dog produces puppies and not
some other animal. It is also the means by
which protective coloring is repeated in the
species. It is the means of evolution; the
oft repeated wish— made through genera­
tions.
The giraffe found that the tender bran­
ches and shoots of young trees pleased its
desire for food the best. The top-most
branches of young trees held the most suc­
culent food. Often they were out of reach.
The Revelation Secret
Through thousands of generations the gir­
affe, stretched and strained and wished that
he could reach these higher branches. That
is how he developed the neck he now has,
longer than any other living specie. The
elephant’s trunk, the long legs of the stork,
all species of life developed their specialities
by this fundamental ability to wish. If this
were not so, man would still be the primi­
tive creature he was thousands of years ago.
God so constructed all living things, that a wish made
in faith and held unremittingly would be granted.
You may say, “All very well, but who
wants to wait thousands of generations for
a wish to come true?” Listen then:—
“But wilt thou know . . . that faith apart from
works is barren? . . . for as the body apart from
the spirit is dead, even so, faith apart from works is
dead."
James 2:17, 20, 26.
When only Desire Power and the Power
of Faith are used— results are obtained but
they sometimes come slowly. But there is
a means of speeding up the process. Remem­
ber the third— the Power of Will. W ith De­
sire and Faith present, the speed with which
your wishes are fulfilled is largely deter­
mined by the intensity of your Will to
have. Will Power— does not mean idly
sitting by and willing a desire into being.
T hat is not possible. Will Power is the
will to do things to bring your desires
3
■The Revelation Secret
about. The will to work, to strive in phy­
sical labor, to sacrifice if necessary. That is
the only Power of Will. Do every prac­
tical thing, no matter how little, to bring
about fufillment of your desire. First, the
Desire must be strong, next, the Faith must
be present, and third, the Will must be in­
tense. These three rules can bring you
anything within the reach of man. It is
the formulae of Joan of Arc, of Napoleon,
of Kublai Khan, of every self-made person
who has accomplished great things.
T w o small boys talking— “W hat would
you rather have, Bill, a pony or an auto­
mobile?” asked the first boy. “Aw, gee,
I'd rather have an aeroplane. I wish I was
a pilot,” says Bill. And the first boy re­
plies “I wish I had a dirigible. And I'm go­
ing to get one when I’m grown up.”
Tillie the Toiler expresses the same
thought when she sees the mink coat in the
furriers window. Old Tompkins agrees he
would like to have the little place out in the
country his wife keeps pointing out to him
on their Sunday drives in their small, six-
year-old car. They sigh and agree that “It
would be nice to have, but it is out of the
question. We’ll just have to do without,”
they say to themselves.
The farmer protests that he does all the
work and gets the short end. He tells him­
self that some day he'll just up and quit
and get a soft snap in the city. And the
The Revelation Secret
commission merchant in the city complains
about his nerves going to pieces. “By George,
I wish I were in some other business,” he
remarks for perhaps the thousandth time.
The lawyer, the banker, the butcher, the
baker, the housewife, all classes pour forth
an endless stream of expressions like these.
Millions of people who give no thought to
what they really want, and DON’T
R E A LIZE T H E Y ARE G E TT IN G JU ST
W H A T T H E Y EXPECT.
These wishes arc like the wind. A short
gust and it's gone to return in a moment
from an opposite direction. Eddying cur­
rents, without depth. Millions of thought­
less wishers. If you are one of these and
want to change your present circumstance or
condition, you can do it. If you want to
achieve some purpose, great or small, you
can do it. If there is something you want to
possess, you can get it. But first of all you
must K N O W W H A T YO U W A N T . That
isn't easy to discover.
For nearly twenty years in my work—
I have sent out questionaires asking people
to write and fill out a blank space follow­
ing the statement “My greatest desire in life
which I wish you to help me accomplish is
Most people never filled it out. They
couldn’t decide. Many of those who did
fill it out, rambled so that it was apparent
that they had no great desire, in fact no real
desire at all. Many more filled in replies
that only a brief study showed were not
The Revelation Secret
their real desires. A few, perhaps one per­
cent, filled it out purposefully. These, I be­
lieve without exception, have been helped
materially.
You must first know what you desire, then
you must really desire it. Not half-hearted,
or idle wishing and forgetting all about it—
but continual, unremitting— recurrent wish­
ing for the same thing, in faith, that you are
getting it. The Powers within you do not
operate otherwise. You must be in earnest.
You must be sincerely desirous. You must
be willing to make sacrifices to receive. The
desire must be intense, burning, and concen­
trated. You must feel each time you think
about it, that you are drawing nearer to it.
Most wishes are only passing fancies.
The two small boys gave no real thought
to actually receiving an aeroplane. It was
merely an idle wish— without Faith that
they would get it. Similar idle fancies and
lack of Faith were in the consciousness of
Tillie the Toiler and Old Tompkins and
his dear wife. The desire was still-born,
killed by lack of Faith and by self-denial.
"It would be nice to have, but it is out of
the question. We’ll just have to do with­
out.” W hat they expect is what they get.
A sincere desire, held unremittingly, is
like a prayer. It is in fact, the very essence
of prayer.

that ye receive them and ye shaft have them. For

The Revelation Secret
THE REVELATION
PRINCIPLE
HERE IS T H E M ETHOD FOR
OBTAINING YOUR DESIRES
DO Make a list of the things you
TH IS want most. D on’t reject any good
desires because it seems unattainable.
Don’t bother your mind about how obtain­
able it may be— the important thing is how
much do you want it. Don’t be afraid of
wanting too much as long as what you want
is good for you.— Rewrite the list every
few days— keep the things you want most
at the top of the list. Add new ones to the
bottom— take off those that no longer seem
desirable. Rewrite the list often whether
you change it or not. D on't leave out your
smaller wishes— they may be easiest to at­
tain. In fact, try for them first, to learn
how to use these Powers. Read this book
often. In particular this page. Whenever
you are in need, read this book again. Read
it often. Follow these directions. They are
psychologically correct— here is the revela­
tion method— reduced to its essence.
I
1st. Read the list whenever you think of it, many
times each day\ Make a practice of reading it
each morning before the days activities and each
evening after the days affairs are over.
2nd. Keep in your mind at all times, what you want.
Keep a mental photograph of the list in your
mind.
3rd. Do not discuss the list with anyone. Do not
struggle with doubt, nor strive to believe; just
make your list and apply Desire, Will and Faith
to carrying out the first two rules.
No matter what your want may be, put
it on your list. It may be a new suit of
clothes or a dress, an automobile, or a home,
money, good health, or advancement. No
matter what it is— put it on your list. Don’t
dream about these things, but think about
them with purpose and apply Will toward
getting them.
When you begin to get results— when
some of your wishes begin to be fulfilled—
give credit to the Creator who gives you
these Powers and to your efforts to use
them. Don’t be ungrateful. Don't dis­
credit. Don’t say “It’s just a coincidence.”
Give credit and know the joy of further ac­
complishment.
Be happy. Keep a song in your heart.
Do not permit any sense of drudgery to be
present while you perform your daily round
of work. This may be difficult if you have
been unhappy in your surroundings, but you
can do it. Stop sighing and expecting the
worst. Expect the best. You eventually
get what you expect. Do your work com­
pletely, joyfully and willingly. Stop self—
denial of the good desirable things that you
want. You C A N get them.
Before publishing this manuscript I show­
ed it to a friend of mine, a young man—
an engineer and aviator. T o my surprise
when he read the Revelation Principle he
The Revelation Secret
suddenly burst out saying, “Koran— this
page alone is worth a thousand dollars to
anyone who will do what it says.’’ I was
quite pleased with his un-intended testimon­
ial, but surprised because I had never before
considered him exactly spiritual. I agree
with him fully however, and trust that you
will prove its value to yourself. I have tried
to eliminate every unnecessary word (ex­
pansion would be easy.) Please give each
sentence thought and follow its directions.
Give particular attention to the paragraph
on Happiness. Follow it and have hap­
piness all the rest of your days, regardless of
your position, regardless of your surround­
ings, regardless of any limiting condition.
"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall
find; knock and it shall be opened unto you: For
everyone that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh,
findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.”
Matthew 7 :7, 8.
"Trust in Jehovah with all thy heart, and lean not on
thine own understanding; In all thy ways acknow­
ledge him, and he will direct thy paths.”
Proverbs 3:5, 6.
Here is an old anecdote that should provoke
thought:
A fairy/once granted an old wood-chop­
per and hjis wife three wishes. The good
man was over-joyed with his good fortune,
but being unaccustomed to thinking deeply
could not decide what to wish for.
He sat down beside his wife to ponder
over it and as the day was warm he absent-
The Revelation Secret
mindedly said, "I wish I had a drink of
cold water.” Instantly there appeared be­
fore him as if by magic, a large glass of
sparkling cold water.
His wife was enraged and berated him
soundly for wasting one of his wishes.
"Thou fool,” she said, "I wish it was fas­
tened on the end of thy nose.” Instantly the
glass of water was attached to his nose so
that no matter how he tried, he could not
detach it.
Of course there was nothing left for them
to do but wish that it was off again. And
so these poor folk in spite of the good fairy,
were no better off than before. They could
have made wise wishes and used the magic
power to benefit them all the rest of their
lives. But through lack of thought they
lost a golden opportunity.
What wishes will YOU make?—Remember, it works!
“And now 1 commend you to God, and to the word
of H is grace, which is able to build you up, and to
give you the inheritance.”
ANOTHER VALUABLE REVELATION
Personal Magnetism
Have you ever wondered why some people of ordinary ap­
pearance are so much more popular than their fellows? Have you
ever speculated on the easy success of some person of your ac­
quaintance, over those about them who possess greater ability
and who work much harder? What is it that made movie stars
like Marie Dressier or Wallace Beery so much more popular than
their younger and more handsome rivals? What is the Power
that some people possess naturally, which we call Personality?
The power that has been nick-named—"It.”
“It” is a power that many mistakenly believe one either has
or does not have. The Revelation devoted to Personal Mag­
netism shows the fallacy of that. “It” is a power of life sub­
stance within us, sometimes called Magnetism, the Power of
Attraction, Charm, Personality. “It” is a power that you possess
—hidden away deep within yourself. Every living person pos­
sesses it, but few know how to employ it. “It” has been charted
and dissected in the Revelation devoted to Personal Magnetism.
Personal Magnetism is really a two months study course,
does not deal with the subject as a theory—but tells you to
“Do this and get this result." Definite directions, not specious
theories. It is a book in manuscript form, in twenty-eight
chapter lessons. It is a book that is unique. Its teachings
are of a thrilling Power within you that may change your en­
tire future, yet its price is only $4.98. It is a book with a
personality of its own, yet it is more than just a book—it is
actually a System for Living, a two months study course.
I want you to speculate on the tremendous desirability of
developing a power of this sort, so dynamic that regardless of
your age or physical beauty it could irresistably draw all people
to you like a magnet. Its value in the business world would be
inestimable. Its desirability in ordinary social contacts, over­
whelming. Its benefits to you, tremendous. There is no magic
in this book—the magic is in You, a manifestation of the life,
energy within you. Read the list on the following page of

GUARANTEE
This is, in effect, a Certificate of
Guarantee, backed by Universal Wis­
dom, assuring you, of a constantly
Increasing Income—
Providing:—
lj/. That you instill these teachings
perfectly in your understanding.
2nd. That you practice them at all
times.
3rd. That you do not stop with just
the instruction given here, but carry
out this Principle in ail your acthn-

Fill in here the amount you want:
INCREASING YOUR
INCOME
If it were possible to instill this instruc­
tion in the minds of all its readers equally
well; if it were possible to cause every read­
er to follow these instructions exactly ; then
The Revelation Secret
a guarantee such as shown above could be
given to every reader. Unfortunately mere­
ly reading it and idly wishing for an in­
creased income is not sufficient. You must
put action behind the wishing, you must
carry out these instructions, you must use
this principle to make it work for you. Not
just now and then, but every minute. Not
only during your working hours, but all the
time. Live it, breathe it, tell others about it;
persevere with it, do not doubt it, and it will
produce for you, not just once but as many
times as you want it to do so. According to
Christian Business;
HOW T O G E T “Probably every person
A RAISE IN knows in a vague way
SALARY that getting money is
the result of earning it. ’’
But very few ever have the perfect vision of
that truth. Sum up all experience, good and
bad, pleasant and unpleasant, and you find
that a person gets back exactly what he gives
out, only multiplied.
Give to anybody service of a kind that
he wants, and you’ll get back the benefit
yourself. If you give more service, you
will get more benefit. If you give a great
deal more, you will get a great deal more.
But, you will get back more than you give.
It’s just like when you plant a bushel of po­
tatoes, you get back thirty or forty bushels,
and you'll get more than that if you give
attention to the growing crop. If you give
more to your employer than he expects of
you, he will give you a raise— and there is
■The Revelation Secret
no other condition that will cause him to
do so. And mark this: His giving you a
raise doesn't depend on his fair-mindedness
— he must give it to you or lose you, be­
cause if he does not appreciate you, some­
one else will.
But that's not all of it. If you give help
to the man who works next to you, it will
come back to you multiplied, even if he
apparently is a rival. W hat you give to
him, you give to the firm, and the firm
will value it, because it is team-work in the
organization that the firm wants first of all,
not brilliant individual performance.
If you have an enemy in the organization,
the same rule holds; if you give him, with
the purpose of helping him, something that
will genuinely help him, you are giving ser­
vice to the organization. Know that the
great corporations appreciate the peace­
maker, for an essential to their success is
harmony among employees. If your boss
is unappreciative, the same rule holds; if
you give him more, in advance of apprecia­
tion, he cannot with-hold his appreciation
and keep his own job
Think about this law— the more you
think about it, the deeper you will see it
goes. It literally hands you a blank check,
signed by the Maker of Universal Law, and
invites you to fill in the amount you want.
And not only that, but you can choose the
kind of payment you want.
"Fair to middlin’’ successes are those who
obey this law a little way— they fill in the
The Revelation Secret
check for a small amount— but they stop
this side of the big vision in it. If only
every employee would get this idea planted
firmly in his mind as a principle, as a law,
not subject to changing with fluctuating
moods— then the success of the organization
could only be described as miraculous.
One of your fears is apt to be, that by
aiding in the other fellow’s success, you may
be side-tracking your own. The exact op­
posite is the truth.
If only every employee would realize that
his own case is an exact parallel to that of
his firm. Consider, what does your firm
give for the money it gets from the public.
Service! Service in advance! And the better
the service that is given out, the more money
comes back.
Now, what does the firm do to call pub­
lic attention to its service? Why it advertis­
es; that’s part of the service. Suppose that
you, as an employee, begin giving your ser­
vice to the firm in advance of all expecta­
tions of payment. Suppose you advertise
your service. How can you do it? Well
you cannot do anything constructive in the
place you’re employed, be it office, or fac­
tory, or premises, that is not service. No
matter whether it is filing a letter correctly,
or fixing a fence, or pleasing a customer—
whether it is looking up a word for the
stenographer or encouraging her to look it
up for herself. It may be by helping your
closest rival to get a raise, or by selling the
The Revelation Secret
entire production for the season.
As for advertising yourself, you begin
advertising yourself the minute you walk
into the office, or the shop, or the store, or
the factory, in the morning— and you can’t
help it. Everybody who looks at you, im­
mediately sees your advertisement, and is
affected according to it. Everybody around
you has your advertisement before their eyes
all day long. So has your boss— your em­
ployer, the head of the firm, no matter
where they are. And if you live up to your
advertising, nobody can stop you from sell­
ing your goods— your services! The more
a man knocks you, the more he advertises
you; because, he calls attention to you; and
if you are delivering something better than
he says you are, the interested parties— your
employers— will see it, and will not be in­
fluenced against you, by what he says.
There is a twin sister to this law— that
takes it even further. It is the law of Giv­
ing. You must give to every human being
you come in contact with, from your wife
to the porter/who sweeps the office; from
your brothei/to the man who acts like your
enemy.
Some psychologists tell you to smile; but
let the smile you give be a real smile that
lives up to its advertising. If you go around
grinning like a Cheshire cat, then the Che­
shire cat grin will be what you get back—
multiplied.
Now, perhaps you wonder why I am so
sure of this law? How can you be sure?

The Revelation Secret
Why, I have watched it work; it always
works— everywhere. You have only to trj
it, and keep on trying it, and keep on, keep
ing on; and it will prove true for YOU.
It is not true merely because / say so. Nor
is it true because anybody else says so. Its
just TRU E, Orientals call it the law of
Karma; humanitarians call it the law of
Service; business men call it the law of
Common Sense; Christ Jesus called it the
law of Love. It rules. Whether you know
it or not, whether you believe it or not,
whether you defy it or not, YO U C A N ­
N O T BREAK IT !
Jesus of Nazareth said, “Give and ye
shall receive—good measure, pressed down,
shaken together, running over!” It is
Truth. If He had never lived, it would still
be true. It is a law of The Father. Whether
we admit it or not, it is T ruth which we all
worship as God. No man can truthfully
say that he does not put the truth supreme.
It is the principle of giving and receiv­
ing— but there are few men who go the
limit on it. But You know now, that go­
ing the limit is the only way to unlimited
returns.
W hat shall you give? W hat you have,
of course. Believe in this idea. Start giv­
ing it out, that is, the idea itself, tactfully,
wisely, and living it yourself wherever you
are. How long do you think it will be be­
fore you are an important personage in your
■The Revelation Secret
organization, recognized as such and getting
pay in proportion? It is worth more in dol­
lars and cents than all the cleverness and
special training you can possibly possess
without it. W hat you have my friend,
GIVE— T O EVERYBODY.
If you have an idea that is good, do not
save it for your own use only; give it. It
is the very best thing you have to give and
because of that, the best thing to give— be­
cause it comes back to you— multiplied. The
better the thing you give— the better the
things that come back to you.
If a man were to follow this, even to his
trade-secrets, he would profit steadily, more
and more. And he will profit more cer­
tainly than he will by holding onto any­
thing for himself. He wouldn't have to
worry about his own affairs— basic law.
Nature’s law never fails. It is easy for you
to discover what is or is not law. And if
law works part of the time, it works all the
time.
Investigate, look around ydu, think! Find
the truth, see it with your own eyes, and
then put this law to the test. T ry it! Use
it! Give it to others and you will find a
blank check waiting for you to fill in with
whatever you desire.
T ry this truth, you ambitious young men
and young women and you older folks too.
There are many applications of this law

We modern Americans look upon ourselves
as well advanced in hygiene, in physics, in
architecture, in medicine, in psychology, in
art, in warfare, in economics, and in govern­
ment. We have wonderful Universities and
gigantic astronomical observatories for
studying “other worlds ” Our newspapers
tell of weird scientific laboratories where
death itself is being experimented with—
where dead men are brought back to life.
“This is American genius,” we say, “and
we can well be proud. Never before has
man been so wise.”
How, then, can I tell you that all this has
been before. The average American has
never even heard of a group of men who
established an Empire in America 10,000
years ago, who were called The Maya. A
few of my readers, perhaps connected with
Geographic Societies, or the more energetic
of our Universities, will ,have heard of the
marvelous and dramatic/ discoveries recently
made. The rest may hazily recall stories of
Montezuma and Cortez— stories of houses

built of gold and lined with precious em­
eralds and diamonds— stories of “heathen”
sun-worshipers— and human sacrifices. The
lies of the adventurers who murdered a non-
resistant nation in their lust for gold and
conquest, are today all that most Americans
know, of a civilization in many respects
superior to our own, and in almost every
respect more advanced than any nation of
their time.
Once upon a time, thousands of years ago,
in America there were many tremendous
Cities, of countless wealth. They were in­
habited by an intelligent people, who as a
race were our superior at least hygienically
and morally. They were possessed of a
government which had solved the social
problem to such a point that none need
work more than three or four hours a week.
Their rulers were scientists as well as
Princes; Priests as well as Law-Makers.
When I say Cities, I do not mean a mere
collection of wigwams or straw hovels. The
Cities of the time of which I speak, were
built of stone and cement, the streets were
paved, the artistic unity of all the buildings
has never been equalled since in America,
although extremely Modern Architecture to­
day is attempting it. The Cities of which
I speak contained sky-scrapers and were con­
nected with other cities by highly improved,
paved, thirty-foot-wide cement roads, some
of which still exist today. I have walked
them.

Ten thousand years ago or more, a Great
Wall like that standing in China today, was
being built in the land of The Maya. Ten
thousand years ago, this civilization was es­
tablishing a unity that reached it’s peak be­

was not enough to erase this culture. Treas­

There was no social problem in Ancient
America as we understand the phrase today.
Government and economics, then, were sup­
erior. Gold, they did not value as money
but as a metal to be owned by all the people
and used for sacred purposes. It was called
the metal of the Sun and was shared by all
in their temples.
In medicine they knew how to overcome
the deadly poisons of serpents and insects
that science today cannot counteract. They
knew how to "raise the dead” as science now
is on the verge of learning. (The discoveries
made by a young Californian, a pathological
experimenter in revival of the dead have re­
ceived much newspaper publicity recently.)
Dentistry was a definite science then, and
there are indications that blood transfusions
were performed. Anesthesia, rediscovered by
us less than 100 years ago, was practiced

In mathematics the Mayas had reached a
remarkable development. They were using
the principle underlying the decimal system
many centuries before Europeans had given
up the clumsy Roman numerals. Their
system was developed before the Hindu’s,
from whom Europe got the idea through
the Arabs.
— o —
Space does not permit a full exposition of
it here— but you can gain an idea of its ef­
ficiency when I tell you that in the Mayan
method of notation, the lowest number in­
dicated by three digits was not 100 as in
our present system, but 400; or twenty-
times-twenty instead of our ten-times-ten.
Computation was many times more rapid
than our system, and through the use of
several ways of writing numerals combined,
a speed was attained comparable only to the
results on a slide rule or the work of an add­
ing machine.
— o —
Even the humblest classes placed much
emphasis upon personal cleanliness; this
greatly impressed the Spanish bishop Diego
de Landa, who in the latter part of the six­
teenth century reported that the Mayas
"bathed continuously.” At least one bath
a day was the rule, which seemed exceedingly
excessive to the Spaniards. House furnish­
ings were simple, even among the wealthy
and the sanitary structure of the room
would please a modern hospital.
The Revelation Secret
They practiced commerce when Europe
was a wilderness. They knew the world
was round like the Sun when the rest of
man-kind thought it to be flat. They were
experts in metal work and plating, gem
cutting and design, weaving and cloth mak­
ing. Their pottery and sculpture and paint­
ing was at its golden age about 500 years
before Christ was born and at that time far
surpassed Egypt and the Orient, and was
more than equal to Greece.
— o —
Of the earlier races in America— the Incas,
the Aztecs, and the Toltecs— the Mayan
system of picture writing was the most ad­
vanced. Examples of this are shown in the
border design of this book. They are au­
thentic.
— o —
An extensive Mayan literature in prose
and verse existed but that which would be
available today was destroyed by the Span­
ish Conquistadores, because they could not
understand it. These recordings were in
books of paper made from maguey leaves,
or .on sheets of deerskin. Other recordings
on stones, walls and buildings are found to­
day mostly in fragments.
— o —
The Ancient Mayans were very religious
and did not make human sacrifice. They
gave great attention to the spiritual powers
and forces of man. They practiced baptism
and the hearing of confessions. They ori­
ginally were not Sun-worshippers in the
The Revelation Secret
sense of considering the Sun a god, but rather
as a manifestation of God and the bringer
of health and light. W ith the aim of secur­
ing prosperity and happiness they studied
the Powers that God (The Great Spirit)
placed in man. With the decline of the race
and the coming of savage tribes from the
North, evil practises appeared and grew. As
a consequence, higher enlightenment was
more and more withdrawn until in the pass­
ing of some three thousand years, the light
was greatly dimmed. Little of it was shed
on the outer world. Indeed, it is the gen­
eral belief today that the Mayan Race is ex­
tinct. Far from that. They still live in
Yucatan and Central America. There are
secret places where great stores of golden
metal as well as golden knowledge is kept.
Another illustration in this book that will
interest you to learn about is the circular
central design in TH E MAYAN Emblem
on the cover. T hat is a reproduction of
the Mayan Calendar Stone, used by permis­
sion of the National Museum at Mexico
City.
— o —
Although Ancient Mayans had no teles­
copes to watch heavenly phenomena with—
yet their scientists did have lenses of natural
crystal or precious stone, which were used to
project images of the sun to temple floors.
Through careful observation of celestial
phenomena, joined with accurate computing
and recording, they were able to invent a
T he Revelation Secret
calendar which is considered their greatest
known intellectual achievement. Although
there is some dispute, it is believed that a
date corresponding to the year 613 Before
Christ, is the zero of the Mayan calendar.
The calendar itself was instituted 33 years
later in 580 B.C. It provides a more exact
day count of the solar year than existed in
Europe until the adoption of the Gregorian
Calendar over two thousand years later. In
other words the calendar which the Span­
iards found in use in Yucatan, and destroy­
ed, was more accurate than their own,
though it was then more than 2,000 years
old. (European scholars place the date earl­
ier than this by nearly three hundred years.)
Our present calendar divides the year into
52 weeks but leaves one day left over. The
Mayan calendar is based on the divisor five
which leaves no remainder in 365 days. The
claim is sometimes made that it is therefore
still superior to our calendar today.
— o -—
The Mayan year was divided into eight­
een periods of twenty days each, with five
days left over, known as days without name.
The Mayan year began July 16 of the Jul­
ian calendar. The Mayan word for day is
“kin” which meant sun. The year was
called "tun.” Twenty years formed a “ka-
tun,” which in turn, multiplied by twenty,
made a period which we call a cycle. Hindu
and European Astrologers made the same
cyclic discovery— later.
The Revelation Secret
The five left-over days were devoted to
penance and fasting, to contemplating the
past years, the telling of the folk-lore of the
race and laying plans for the future. They
were devoted to study of the spirit and soul
— to contemplating the powers of the mind
and mysteries in general. The teachings in
this book is like the knowledge these ancient
ones possessed and handed down, except that
here, they have been co-related to modern
“discoveries" in the field of “psychology"
and have had added to them the teachings
of Christ Jesus.
— o —
Great was the learning of the leaders of
this race in the mysterious powers of the
mind. Occult students know that the
Mayans possessed the secret of moving in the
astral body while the physical body remained
behind. Great schools had been established
teaching the magic of the mind. These
schools exist today in secret places. For
generations this golden knowledge has been
kept, giving only to a few. Modern science
is beginning to catch up. The time has
come when some of the ancient wisdom will
be given to those desiring to receive. Those
who first master it will have understanding
beyond the multitude. T o spread this
knowledge to those who ally themselves
with us in brotherhood— is the purpose of
T H E MAYAN ORDER. To aid in the
advancement and betterment of man, in
•anu
T he Revelation Secret
body, mind, spirit and soul, is its mission.
— o —
Superior to their times as this ancient
race was, I do not mean to give the im­
pression that they were all super-men. In
their great cities there were the laboring
classes and the slaves, as well as the intel­
lectually advanced, and the Priest-Scientist
rulers of the masses. All the people did not
possess enlightenment to an equal extent.
Like civilization today,, there were degrees
of intelligence. There were some who turn­
ed away from learning— not desiring it and
many who would only misuse it if they re­
ceived it. T hat is true today as it was then.
Such people are born to be slaves, the ser­
vants of others who gain the golden knowl­
edge.

The Mayans Invite You
You, dear reader, right now, have the
opportunity of making a similar choice. Will
you spurn the teachings or seize the oppor­
tunity to receive? This book, if you have
studied it carefully and practiced its teach­
ings, will have brought you to a realization
of the possibilities of the super-powers you
possess. Will you master them? Again you
find yourself faced with the need to make
a decision. Will I have the opportunity of
again congratulating you— this time in full
fraternity and brotherhood.
The Revelation Secret
It is usual to think of America as “a con­
tinent without history.” The folly of that
is extreme. For centuries before European
occupation, the region shown in the circle
on the map, was the seat of a civilization
boasting a history and a folk-lore second to
none in richness or interest. The Mayans
of old exhibited an attitude of scientific in­
quiry in all fields of human knowledge and
activity. Their most precious possession
was knowledge of the God-given powers of
man. T hat was ihore precious and sacred
than gold. They shared their knowledge
with all who were worthy.
— o —
TH E MAYAN ORDER today, operates
on that idea. They will share with you as
a fellow Member, knowledge of God's
Powers in man. Learning gleaned in
secret places— libraries worth many thous­
ands of dollars are combed— expeditions to
the ancient pyramids are being planned now.
T H E MAYAN ORDER does not confine
itself to Ancient American knowledge alone.
It brings to you esoteric secrets from India,
Egypt, and the Orient as well. Occult science
is a science beyond science and with true
scientific spirit TH E MAYANS of today
study what is known and freely give it to
others for their advancement.
T hat is the spirit of T H E MAYAN
ORDER. As a Member you are asked to
teach and help others. Not to show the
lecture lessons that are sent to you— they
T he Revelation Secret
ire secret— but to instruct others who need
help, in the parts .of the lessons that may
be used to man-kind's benefit. These les­
sons are free to all Members. “Freely re­
ceived and freely given.’’
TH E MAYANS of today share their
gold with you. For knowledge is Golden.
It is gold in the heart, in the mind, and in
the hand. YOU ARE IN V ITED T O
SHARE IT.
If you are accepted for Membership— If
you are judged worthy to receive— all in­
structions are free. You are not charged
anything for them. The lessons are sent to
you regularly as an incident to your Mem­
bership. Can you qualify? Do you feel
the call? Do you enjoy helping others—
your fellow-men? Then respond! Rem­
ember the way to Victory described in this
book? You have started on the path to A t­
tainment. Don’t falter now— The way is
clear. If you Desire to receive instruction
so up-lifting and benefitting and inspiring
that it can change your whole life for the
better, send in your request for admission
to Membership, NOW. As it may take
some time before it can be acted on— and as
the class being formed is limited to one hun­
dred selected from applicants all over North
America— it is important that you fill out
the form and place your application with­
out delay.
The Revelation Secret
Read Very Carefully
W H A T MEMBERSHIP Since the race of
MEANS TO YOU man arose to
the state of civi­
lization he has recognized the benefits and
values of Fraternal Brotherhood. Men and
women of present times are joining hun­
dreds of organizations and associations, be­
cause of the direct and indirect benefits to
be obtained. This spirit is responsible for
all the advance made by the race from an­
cient times until today. The desire for al­
liance with others of like mind, the need for
association, is born from the human tenden­
cy to the formation of clans. It is the spirit
that brings about the building of villages,
towns, countries and nations. It is fast be­
coming again, the principle necessary for
existence.
— o —
By becoming a Member of TH E
MAYAN ORDER, You will be fraternally
affiliated with an increasing body of pro­
gressive men and women whose sincere de­
sire is to advance in life— to succeed in the
attainment of that most elusive state— Real
Happiness. A body of men and women
who also recognize the need for building in
this life— for enjoyment of a better life to
come. A body of men and women who
upon mastery of TH E MAYAN Teachings,
become centers of help and inspiration for
the people of their community, and for
T he Revelation Secret
themselves.
Through correspondence and fraternal at-
tunement, each Member is kept informed of
all progressive methods for overcoming the
obstacles of life. Ancient wisdom is combin­
ed with modern knowledge and given freely.
You, as a Member, receive all the personal
information, advice and help that TH E
MAYAN ORDER possesses.
There are degrees for the Member to pass
through, that can be likened to the degrees
given by a University. The instructions
are given step by step, are readily under­
standable and lead you easily, up through
the higher degrees. THE MAYAN ORDER
is not a correspondence school. Its teach­
ings are not for sale. They are given freely
to those who are admitted as Members of
the Order and every Member is entitled to
the complete instructions. THE MAYAN
ORDER does not seek great numbers who
are associated with it in name only. It
wants those who desire intensely to make
something of their lives. There are no ad­
vertising campaigns— no parades of its
Members. Each Member studies quietly in
his own home— occasionally in small gath­
erings where each individual receives Per­
sonal help and guidance.
T hat mind influences, in fact controls the
body— no one today will deny. Yet a few
The Revelation Secret■
years ago people generally did not know it.
The Mayans of old, understood this prin­
ciple— they knew that it is possible to in­
fluence others at a distance. Their belief
is that as the sun radiates light, so can the
mind radiate thought.
— o —
TH E MAYAN ORDER shows how you
can influence others. This knowledge of
old is not a superstitions
fallacy,— it is not magic— it is
a power of mind that all nor­
mal persons possess. It is one
of the many enlightening, in­
spiring, principles given to you
as a Member of the Order.

Not one man or woman in a thousand
has any realization of the great, the tremen­

is the few who do that TH E MAYANS
T h e Revelation Secret
invite to join their Brotherhood.
— o —
W HAT MEMBERSHIP You are invited
BRINGS T O YOU to join with us.
By filling out
the Application form you indicate your de­
sire to accept the invitation and to apply for
election to the class of one hundred now
forming. Your application will be examined
and voted on. If for some reason you can­
not be accepted you will be notified and
your deposit returned to you. Otherwise,
upon your election, you will be accepted and
a formal notice sent to you.
You will be given a Membership Card of
Identification, and, as you advance, certain
signs and words, indicating your initiation
in the Order. You receive private instruc­
tions at regular intervals. In taking the first
three degrees you are taught the meaning of
Brotherhood— W hat it means to You. You
are given an understanding of Yourself, your
Being, that will forever after enable you to
understand yourself, Mind, Body, Spirit and
Soul, far better. You will be told of things
about the race of Man that you will find
nowhere else in the world. You will learn
things about ancient America that will
astound you, Knowledge of your own
Powers that will thrill you.
Instructions taking you into the Third
Degree usually require about six weeks.
After passing it you are prepared for higher
The Revelation Secret
degrees which have to do with mastering
obstacles and adverse conditions about you,
and the fulfillment of your higher destiny.
There is nothing that must be committed to
memory. The instruction is given so that
you “absorb” it rather than memorize it.
Every Member, regardless of the Degree
he has attained in the Order, is entitled to
help and advice through metaphysical and
other methods, by correspondence without
charge. You may also, at any time, write
for additional information on the lessons,
aid in health matters, etc.
— o —
This class will be drawn from all of
North America. THE MAYAN ORDER
has never advertised its existence, and has
never sought Members. Its brotherhood
and all its benefits are open to all elected
worthy, male or female. Its purpose is the
betterment of its Members in all depart'
ments of life and through its Members min­
istering to all of man-kind. All benefits
and instructions are given free of charge to
its Members.

DUES AND FEES ORDER is like many
other f r a t e r n a l
brotherhoods in one sense and quite unlike
them in another. As in other organizations
■The Revelation Secret-
there are Membership dues, payable monthly.
There is also an enrollment fee that is no­
minal. These small dues and fees are the
contributions of the Members to the gen­
eral operating funds of THE MAY AN
ORDER, and take care of its methods of
investigation, research and exploring expedi­
tions. It is also intended to cover the cost
of preparation and mailing of your lessons.
These lessons are given without charge of
any kind to Members of the Order. Remem­
ber, this is a separate feature of T H E
MAYAN ORDER, not found in ordinary
fraternal organizations, and for which ac­
tually, the Member does not pay.
— o —
The Enrollment Fee has purposely been
made very small. It is Tw o Dollars, pay­
able with your application. This fee is
paid only once, when you start. Monthly
dues are $2.50 per month if paid monthly,
or $7.00 quarterly, when paid three months
in advance. There are no assessments. There
are no books to be purchased in order to
study. All instructions are free. And
there are no limitations as tc the extent of
the advancement that Members may make
in their studies. I feel that there is no sacri­
fice too great to make where self-improve­
ment is concerned.
HERE IS WHAT First: Fill out the Application Blank
YOU SHOULD DO. carefully. (AH applications are
confidential.)
Second: Having marked the Application Blank, sign it ac­
curately. Enclose with it the Enrollment Fee of
$2.00 and one month’s dues (or more.)
