Fifteen days later, on October 16, I was sitting by my 2 daughters.  My newbown was ready to sleep in my lap.  I began to suffer a terrible headache that was so intense that I put the newborn into her cot beside the bed.  The pain intensified and I could no longer breathe.  I cried in pain and called for help.  My mother came first and then my father.  My father called the doctor and started to give me Reiki.  My oldest daughter was sitting on the edge of the bed, and I cried to my mother to take the children with her. 
 
 My father conversed with me.  I told him that I was looking at a very white light.  He grabbed my hand and asked, '˜Do you want to go to the light?' I covered my eyes, and told him that I didn't want to go. 
 
  I was out of my body. I saw my mother while she was crying and looking after a baby in another room.  I saw my eldest daughter who was with my mother in the bed.  I saw my father calling the ambulance. I felt all the anguish that my family felt.  I saw the ambulance as it arrived as they took me to the hospital and as I went into the emergency room.  I saw the doctors as they said there was no pulse.  I saw it all but nobody could hear me.  Although I was in a coma, I saw how they came to see me.  I saw my teenage brother when he arrived two days later, but he couldn't hear me.  I was there but I wasn't in my body.  I saw my husband.  I was asking everyone about my children, yet nobody replied to me. 
 
 I had a brain bleed.  Some days after the bleed, the doctors weren't holding out any hope for me because they said I was brain dead.  They didn't want to operate on me because there was no hope.  Yet, a doctor did operate on me. 
 
   					It was months later. I was alive and I left the hospital.  Meanwhile, my body was all there, my mind and spiritual body too.  Yet, I wasn't quite there. My spiritual body (I don't know how to say it) - I went with my father and my husband on a trip to places that I know and places I don't know.  But at the moment of return, we were in a very cold place, we were wearing cold-weather gear, and gloves.  I was dying of cold and asked them for a coffee.  They embraced me and told me it was time to return.  This was when I awoke from the coma. I saw my older brother, who had been with me, with a great big smile, calling the doctor. The Doctor arrived, and asked me 'What is your name?' I replied 'Geo' and my brother smiled.

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?     I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.    The memories of my experience are equal. Equal to the events of my life, with the difference that with those of the experience they are difficult to describe, or to put into context, because they are not explicable to people that have never had a similar experience.

He saw himself lying covered in blood, and everything that happened, as if someone or something carried him.  He shouted â€˜No!â€™ this didn't affect my experience because it was very different to that which he had chatted to me about.

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was probably not real      A few days later, I wasn't able to assimilate everything that had happened to me physically.  At that time, I was beginning to remember the experience and trying to find explanations for it, but now I have understood and assimulated it perfectly.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     Yes   Everything that happened to me, I remember, the admission to the emergency ward and the hospital, and the smell of the things in the hospital.
