  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I   talked with a retired anesthesiologist that I see periodically in follow up.&nbsp; He   indicated that Ketamine was approved for anesthesia in children and adults many   decades ago.&nbsp; He remembers the day well.&nbsp; For whatever reason, approval to use   Ketamine began at 11:00 AM on a particular day.&nbsp; They rescheduled an obese   patient with hemorrhoids to undergo surgery that afternoon.&nbsp; The patient   received Ketamine, and bled profusely.&nbsp; Apparently Ketamine does not lower the   blood pressure the way most other anesthetic agents do.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   This anesthesiologist indicated that he used Ketamine as an anesthetic regularly   for three months for adult anesthesia.&nbsp; He would routinely ask patients after   surgery about their experience with the anesthesia.&nbsp; He recalls that about 75%   of his patients receiving Ketamine described frightening dream-like   hallucinations.&nbsp; The other 25% did not describe any particular experience.&nbsp; So   many patients had frightening hallucinations with Ketamine that he stopped using   Ketamine routinely in adults after about three months.&nbsp; He would continue to use   Ketamine for selected patients, especially trauma patients where low blood   pressure was a concern.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Only a few percent of NDEs are predominantly frightening, and even these   frightening NDEs are generally not dream-like or hallucinatory.&nbsp; This   anesthesiologist's observations are some of the most objective and reliable   observations about experiences associated with Ketamine.&nbsp; Experiences reported   during NDEs are very different from Ketamine experiences.&nbsp; There is no evidence   that Ketamine consistently reproduces any element of NDE.
