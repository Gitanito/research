My four year old son was waiting for me to finish so he could take a bath.  I reached for the sink in order to get out.  I had a curling iron plugged in but it was off.  I reached over the iron and it jumped off the counter and hooked on to my wrist.  I tried to get it off me but couldn’t.  I saw my son try to reach for it and I got out one word. No.  I knew if he touched it we would both die.  Finally, I fell in the tub. The pain was just too much.  Then I could not breathe anymore.  I had no more pain. Everything was very calm and peaceful.  Then came a light like I have never seen.  The only way to explain is like being outside looking up at the sun with your eyes closed.  Then all of a sudden, air came into my lungs I jumped up and out of the tub in millisecond.  There was my four year old son holding the plug to the curling iron.  He pulled it out.  What made him know how to save his mom?
