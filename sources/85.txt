 &nbsp; &nbsp;     Periodical:  Light From The Spirit World</I>      

    Summary&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Light from the Spirit World.
 1852-1853  Weekly
 St. Louis, MO.  Publisher: W.H. Mantz, publisher and editor.  Editor: Peter Bland and W.H. Mantz.
 1/1, October 10, 1852, "and was continued about one year."  $1.25 a year. 4 pp.

 The publisher's intention was to bind the journal and sell it in two volumes a year, as were the Shekinah and other journals.  The advertisement in the Spiritual Telegraph of May 28, 1853, tells us that the spirits had "induced the friends of these wonderful phenomena" to publish a journal that "will be devoted to the dissemination and elucidation of the facts as they transpire in Circles of Spiritual Investigation, so far as authentic information of them may be obtained."
