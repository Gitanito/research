well welcome back everyone
this segment is really going to be a
drill down on what people call a lien
now what&#39;s interesting about this and
the reason I put a lien in quotes and
you&#39;ll see the title is contact on the
cosmos a framework of understanding this
next 45 minutes or so it&#39;s going to be a
very deep look at that
what how is a cosmos structured how do
you make contact but most importantly
what kind of various phenomena is
occurring that it&#39;s all being called
alien now we live in a space age and so
people are going to put everything in
the context of the world and the time
they live in as the Vedas say the world
is as you are so many people have
experienced various intelligences some
or extraterrestrial some are man-made
and some are from other dimensions and
how do you distinguish them and that&#39;s
why there are three broad categories
here that I want to go through the first
one and the word alien which I&#39;d never
use and you know here&#39;s why it&#39;s too
broad people use it
meaning extraterrestrial but they&#39;re
actually using it describing a whole
bunch of phenomena only a small part of
which is extraterrestrial and they don&#39;t
know it and they don&#39;t want you to know
it
discernment is key and if you lack
discernment you can be fooled and that&#39;s
what this is all about you have to
attain discernment so under
extraterrestrial the first thing I have
are TD is transdimensional interstellar
extraterrestrial beings that means
civilizations from another physical
planet
who have physical bodies and physical
starships that go from one star system
to this one but they&#39;re not doing it
through a straight line space travel
like space shuttle because you have to
go beyond the speed of light and in the
mid-90s I wrote a paper called the
crossing point of light and the reason I
did was is because most of what is in
the cosmos is resonating at frequencies
beyond the speed of light
electromagnetic energy matter or
space-time as we think of it
ie other dimensions when you are going
from let&#39;s say the Andromeda galaxy I&#39;m
going to show you a photograph of an
ambassador from Andromeda who visited us
at Joshua Tree National Park a few years
ago if you&#39;re going from there which is
2.5 million light years from Earth and
if you&#39;re traveling at the speed of
light it&#39;ll take you how long to get
here
2.5 million years but it would take you
to five million years to get back and
that&#39;s at the speed of light five
million years round-trip not going to
happen never going to happen so that
means that by definition if a
civilization has reached earth from
another star system they are going
beyond the speed of light and now we&#39;re
in a whole new physics and this is the
physics they do not want you to know
about that has been studied for the
better part of a century that deals with
transdimensional interdimensional
systems so you can take this object well
laser pointer put an electromagnetic
field around it in such a way that it
will levitate become almost massless but
if you click it a little bit further in
resonant frequency it will disappear
from visual space-time
and you can make it reappear at another
point in space-time
I&#39;m qualitatively trying to describe
what&#39;s actually happening now
this was began to be observed you know
Einstein called it the spooky effect
we&#39;re the same particle could be in two
places at once
resonantly and he called it the spooky
effect or spooky to him because he
didn&#39;t understand it I remind people
that someone once asked Feinstein what&#39;s
it like to be a genius he says I don&#39;t
know ask Nikola Tesla so at any rate
I&#39;ll leave that be history&#39;s always fake
but what you find is that civilizations
that have evolved past the nuclear level
the sub atomic level of understanding
beyond even the zero point energy level
into the transdimensional level are
extraordinarily developed where their
technologies are interfacing with linear
space-time this dimension 3d 4d but
they&#39;re actually traversing other
dimensions to go from point A to B
however briefly their communication
systems instead of being you know we
think our cell phones and smartphones
are so fabulous well it&#39;s 1844 radio
frequencies and what have you their
communication systems interface directly
with thought so you think to it it
interacts and transmits it
instantaneously across any distance of
space-time in real time that&#39;s the only
way you can communicate across millions
of years light-years of space does this
make sense to people so far if I&#39;ve lost
you already we&#39;re in trouble because
this is that this is the elementary
level now once you reach that capability
it means that you&#39;re able to move across
the vastness of space in
actions of what you would even at the
speed of light and almost approaching
instantaneously if your technologies are
that advanced some are it may take a
month to go a couple thousand light
years for some for others that are
developed at a different level it may be
seconds or instantaneous at the speed of
thought but I always point out to people
what&#39;s the speed of thought
well it&#39;s thought emerges within the
consciousness field and is beyond the
limits of space or time which means it&#39;s
infinite infinitely fast but
instantaneously and omnipresent so
that&#39;s the field we&#39;re talking about the
consciousness field now when you&#39;re
dealing with an interstellar
civilization here on the left side of
this chart now you have all these
technologies and it is just a brief
summary so you have very advanced
artificial intelligence to the level
where the AI artificial intelligence is
exact mirror of the consciousness of the
occupants of the craft how many people
have had an encounter with a UFO and
felt that the craft itself was conscious
yeah I mean that&#39;s the real McCoy
because their technology is transmitted
straight through it and their guidance
systems are linked to their bio electric
field and fought and their communication
systems are interfacing with coherent
thought not just random folks but you
think coherently with intention bang
bang transportation similarly they&#39;re
dropping if you will arising into a
dimension beyond the frequency of light
time matter and that frequency it looks
like they just disappear well they
haven&#39;t disappeared to be sitting right
here in the corner of the room you
wouldn&#39;t see it with the naked eye nor
would any camera necessarily get it some
but they will be sitting right there
and this is not the same as cloaking
this is actually where an object quote D
materializes but that&#39;s the kind of a
pop-culture term it&#39;s actually the
resonant frequency of the craft and
everyone on it shifted so it&#39;s beyond
the visible and beyond the limits of
linear space-time and that&#39;s how they&#39;re
moving across these vast distances
because they&#39;re in a state of massless
Ness now if you look at your physics
equations there&#39;s an inverse
relationship between mass and velocity
so but if mass goes to zero velocity
theoretically can go to infinity does it
make sense so this is your elementary
high school level physics but that&#39;s
what we&#39;re dealing with in terms of the
science of these extraterrestrial
civilizations and they have what I&#39;ve
called tac and CAT technology assisted
consciousness and consciousness assisted
technology meaning that they have
technology that assists their own
consciousness in communicating seen
what&#39;s been called remote viewing
distant places they also have
consciousness that interfaces with the
technologies so there&#39;s it goes both
directions because there&#39;s a virtually
seamless integration between thought
mind craft and all of those technologies
this is why I opened this meeting today
saying that the big science of the next
thousand years to me the science of
consciousness this presents a problem as
you will see if you look at this chart
because look what else is up there in
front of you you have
naturally-occurring not extraterrestrial
but interdimensional beings and you know
there are all kinds of I&#39;ll give you one
silly example of this anyone ever heard
of a ghost
well I&#39;m an emergency doctor so I&#39;ve had
a little experience with some strange
things in the ER at 3:00 and 4:00 in the
morning and doctors often have these
experiences they don&#39;t like to talk
about it because they don&#39;t want to be
ridiculed because we&#39;re all still in
kindergarten and our ego structures were
afraid of being HOH they&#39;re gonna make
fun of me oh [ __ ] that so grow up so
excuse my language but it is time for us
to sort of like own this stuff I was in
the ER in North Carolina and we had a
patient come in terrible trauma case and
he died intoxicated it was a violent
death murder and so we did what we could
can&#39;t do everything he passed away a few
hours later the whole ER gets quiet no
one&#39;s in there for one moment of peace
three or four in the morning and I&#39;m
sitting in the center with the nurses
and we&#39;re just hanging out all of a
sudden in the trauma room that he had
passed away in the EKG machine turns on
IV pump turns on the cabinet&#39;s open and
all the junk IV bags and stuff start
hurling onto the floor there&#39;s nobody in
there he was so mad he know this guy was
so mad he came back and was able to
interface from the dimension you go into
and you drop your body and go into your
astral form and he was there in the ER
doing all this chaos now the nurses and
I looked at each other we knew exactly
what this was but of course you Burton
this is not going into the patient&#39;s
chart patient returns three hours later
and tears up the trauma room no no no no
we&#39;re not gonna do there but I wanted to
keep my medical license so it is a shame
you can&#39;t talk about these things in
scientific circles but all right
that&#39;s the that&#39;s the reductionist
paradigm that science is in now but it
happened now that was an
extraterrestrial but it interfaced with
this dimension and had a physical effect
and it was a deceased human being in a
state of rage still attached to the
point where he passed away in that
trauma room now there are millions of
accounts like this
there are also dimensions that where you
have beings that are intelligent that
were never in this dimension but who are
in those other dimensions who can push
into or affect or have manifestations in
this dimensions in this dimension and
that weren&#39;t human but also our next
tutorial you see where I&#39;m going and
those dimensions are equally real and
there have been phenomena related for
years about who will be called an angel
or a fairy or this or that it doesn&#39;t
mean it&#39;s an extraterrestrial but
someone without the knowledge of this
cosmology so you can have an ancestral
spirit you can have a poltergeist
phenomenon you can have intelligent
beings who reside in astral dimensions
as they&#39;re called that are the body of
light that you have a lucid flying dream
with that&#39;s astral
but that&#39;s where their primary that&#39;s
where they are from but they can come
into this dimension some are of higher
frequency some are lower some are more
conscious some are not so conscious this
is like people and some can be scary and
some can be beautiful and this is where
the whole term of you angels and demons
came from and so when you get to the
celestial level of highest higher you
get into the angelic and then the pure
thought realms causality and this
cosmology goes on and on and on now all
of these that are naturally occurring
I&#39;m calling interdimensional can have
manifestations
or phenomenon that look a lot like this
because these are crossing through
dimensions to get into this time space
and so phenomenologically what you might
see or experience from a poltergeist an
astral being a lower or higher one or
even angelic being could be confused
with some of the manifestations of an
extraterrestrial civilization that is
transdimensional and has the ability to
teleport transfer through space-time
it&#39;s interesting to me how many people I
worked with in the intelligence
community in advanced engineering
systems who had various experiences with
this in experiments they&#39;ve done and
they didn&#39;t understand the cosmology of
what was happening in their laboratory
we&#39;re going to talk about this in a
moment
now there&#39;s another category of ATS
these are ones that are not developed
technologically their physical their
conscious they have higher intelligence
they&#39;re like us not having attained
interstellar technological capabilities
yet at least not publicly acknowledged
but they have the ability to develop
consciousness and in consciousness
astrally project or see other worlds and
appear in this one for example let&#39;s
turn this around to the human experience
the aboriginals in Australia well-known
for dream time we&#39;re in dream time they
communicate with each other you can see
what&#39;s gonna happen the next day go to
distant places and it&#39;s part of their
culture many cultures to do this now in
the West we&#39;ve suppressed all this you
know that&#39;s voodoo or whatever it isn&#39;t
it&#39;s a natural capability for the human
mind to be able to go to distant places
within the Faculty of consciousness
itself
so to confuse things further you could
have extraterrestrial civilizations that
are not yet interstellar and
transdimensional in terms of traveling
but who have the ability to be aware of
us and we could be aware of them but
within the fault realm or the lucid
dream realm they&#39;re real but they&#39;re not
physically able to move off their planet
yet maybe they&#39;re like we were when we
were cavemen but they have consciousness
and they can experiment and travel and
they do so that&#39;s another category now
you&#39;re saying boy I might confuse now
and I&#39;m trying to give some clarity this
is actually the simplest level of this I
can provide you what the the
interstellar civilizations that we would
call extraterrestrials et like in the
movie et or you know Close Encounters of
the Third Kind those civilizations have
attained a level of science where they
can move from one star system to another
and go transdimensional II I call it
transdimensional more than
interdimensional because they&#39;re just
transit transit teen those dimensions
does that make sense as opposed to
interdimensional beings that are based
in other dimensions that can then pop
into this one now there are a lot of
people that I talked to who have had
experiences with beings that quite
clearly we&#39;re not et extraterrestrial
but were ultra terrestrial or
interdimensional beings and they think
that they were in et because we live in
an era that space age and there&#39;s very
few people trying to provide clarity on
this and I find that very curious
because this is most of this information
is ancient knowledge that&#39;s in most
cultures right almost I mean they&#39;re you
know everything onto on the this middle
part is things that people have talked
about studied for millennia with the
ancestors
personal meditative experiences astral
projection the rori secretions bond and
on and on but if you don&#39;t understand
that there&#39;s this enormous overlap in
phenomenon between a transdimensional
interstellar civilization and how these
and other interdimensional beings that
are based in other dimensions might
appear to you you&#39;re gonna get too
confused
you&#39;re you need to be able to ask the
question is it et or something else and
the most complicating one is the one I
will get to in a moment on the right
side as you&#39;re facing this chart and
those are the man-made phenomenon but
let&#39;s let&#39;s nail down these first two do
you get this is this clear to people so
mmm-hmm no yes okay so I&#39;m not saying
that extraterrestrial civilizations all
of them or at the level of
transdimensional and interstellar there
are ones that aren&#39;t that aren&#39;t
travelling here physically but which we
may detect and they may be able to
appear in a way that is noncorporeal or
if they&#39;re very advanced physically but
they don&#39;t have a spaceship because
that&#39;s one of the advanced Vedic cities
sidd H is where you can materialize
yourself at remote places before I was a
binnacle doctor I was a scholar of the
Vedas in Sanskrit and a meditation
teacher so this was like really mother
my rude education and what you find with
this is that there&#39;s a very important
distinction that needs to be understood
if you&#39;re going to go out under the
stars with your team to make close
contact with these civilizations because
in the process of doing the meditation
and the consciousness work together you
might have an experience with an
extraterrestrial
an interdimensional being an
interdimensional e traveling
extraterrestrial that doesn&#39;t have a
spacecraft but is still planetary bound
or you may be targeted
by the intelligence community with some
what&#39;s called WS FM weird science and
freakin magic that is what they call it
Northrop Grumman a is called PF and pure
f and magic that&#39;s the high end of the
electronic systems and those can
simulate everything ET everything
interdimensional and those have been
fully operational since at least the 50s
so this is the bombshell coming now
there&#39;s a method to my madness of
putting this chart up I don&#39;t know if
this is clarifying things we can spend
an entire day on each column we don&#39;t
have an entire day we have another one
and a half hours so what I want to do is
give you a few little examples of of
each let&#39;s say you&#39;re out under the
stars you see an object in the sky it
materializes doesn&#39;t move in like an
airplane it then D materializes the next
thing you know there are these beans
walking around you who phase in and out
of this dimension that some people can
see in some cannot but the cameras
sometimes will photograph them because
the C CDs and the digital white cells
will pick them up that your eyes can&#39;t
I&#39;ll show you some of these pictures
these are actual ETS but they&#39;re moving
nonlinearly and non-locally because the
nature of the cosmos is that it is a
conscious holographic universe the
entire cosmos is awake and every star in
every photon and everything that exists
in it has as its basic level of energy
and foundation pure consciousness now
the science behind this has been pretty
well established over the last 50 years
and in scientific labs like dr. John at
Princeton where they&#39;ve done experiments
with random number generators they can
you know put a random number generator
out there have someone visualize it
spitting out more zeros than one
and it will two people who love each
other or who united be ten times the
effect this is going to have a big
meaning in a little while because that&#39;s
the power of people coming together who
understand what conscious mind is now on
top of all this phenomenon this
phenomenon oh gee that goes on and on
and on you can then have as I mentioned
before an experience with a beam from an
interdimensional realm or another realm
of being like a refined level of the
astral and some people call this the
angelic realm and what-have-you and it
was interesting when I was at the the
Vatican talking to Monsignor Balducci
who was a senior theologian that Pope
John Paul he said you know people
confuse this all the time but angels and
demons they don&#39;t need flying saucers
there is such a simple statement I said
yes of course but they do confuse it all
the time and so what you find is that
there are parts of the intelligence
community that want it to be confused
because they&#39;re going to use it to fake
things
stay tuned a few more minutes I&#39;m gonna
explain this now on the other hand the
actual extraterrestrial civilizations
they&#39;re sort of waiting for us to wake
up a little bit and make contact with
them but they&#39;re also are preparing in
case we don&#39;t and we blow the system so
a lot of what you see with
extraterrestrial involvement with the
earth has to do with the fact that we
are at this crossroads where we&#39;re
either going to go or it&#39;s a go or no go
unfortunately the people who think that
the ETS are going to land on the White
House lawn and fix everything ain&#39;t
gonna happen
alright as I wrote in 1991 in a paper
that got passed very quickly through the
intelligence community and the aerospace
community there only a few conditions
under which there would be an overt
massive intervention and they&#39;re not
they&#39;re ones that would involve
a catastrophic geophysical collapse like
a polar shift or something like that or
asteroid hit that made the dinosaurs
extinct a massive thermonuclear or
another some other kind of man-made or
natural catastrophe that would be an
extinction level event then the
intervention is going to be overt and
you see it everywhere all over the earth
at once
short of that they&#39;re waiting for us to
become peaceful civilized non violent
etc and that&#39;s what they&#39;ve been waiting
for for a long time meanwhile they also
know that there are elements of human
civilization that have advanced far
ahead of what&#39;s been disclosed to the
public that have weaponized
interdimensional technologies as well as
technologies that can potentially go
interstellar and that becomes an
existential threat to not only the human
race but to other civilizations and
other planets there&#39;s where the conflict
is very serious problem now once you get
into this area and now we&#39;re going to
get into some of this fun and I call
this the exotic hidden knowledge of the
aerospace science and high-tech world
that isn&#39;t that Apple and it&#39;s not in
Silicon Valley for the most part they&#39;re
operating out of the skunk works
Lockheed Martin they&#39;re operating out of
Northrop they&#39;re operating out of
certain skiffs secure communication
formation facilities that are
underground and they are amazing now
unfortunately I&#39;ve been read into a lot
of these right into his military speak
for brief in my sojourn over the last
quarter of a century since 1993 I&#39;ve
been brought to places where a lot of
this exists and I&#39;ve been given
documents and demonstrations and it&#39;s
kind of Toto curling and mind-blowing
and about 1994 I had people come to me
who felt I needed to know what were in
these projects that had been developed
4050 years earlier after World War Two
now the most obvious and and this is a
wonderful we don&#39;t we just got this but
those of you who can see it this is a
the alien reproduction vehicles that
were at Norton Air Force Base there&#39;s a
big one the Papa one and the the medium
size and the mama and the little baby
one and I forget the dimensions like a
hundred feet 50 feet 30 feet something
like that and these are electromagnetic
wave it expand this was in 1988 that
there were some people who were in there
that described these devices this was
sort of like a museum these had been
around for a while because as I
mentioned the big breakthroughs in
electromagnetic research were done
between the late 1800s and the mid 50s a
man named Rick Foix who I&#39;d worked with
for years who is a senior scientist at
the naval research labs had been in a in
the vault it&#39;s called and seen documents
where it described that we had mastered
gravity control in October 1954 that was
you know I was born in 55 I&#39;m no spring
chicken so since most of us have been
alive we have not needed cars jets
rockets trains ships on the ocean like
we see shuttles space shuttles
centralized utilities oil gas
coal nuclear power power all of it has
been obsolete since before I was born
now this is scandalous because we&#39;ve run
amuck of the planet have had untold
millions of people die from poverty
starvation oil Wars etc all
unnecessarily if we had gotten it right
between World War 1 and the end of World
War two we didn&#39;t the oligarchs the war
mongers and the fascists keep
undermining human advancement you have
to understand this so these technologies
if you look at the work of T Townsend
Brown in the late 20s he was doing work
that was causing lifter and levitation
effect 20s so by the time World War two
ended Hitler and some of his folks is
they had some ingenious people were
working on this and they got pretty
close to gravity control not quite and
that was all them brought in as I
mentioned earlier by OSS which became
the CIA into the United States and that
was joined by the use of advanced
electromagnetic weapons to track and
target and down extraterrestrial
spacecraft
that were doing reconnaissance at our
top-secret nuclear and early space
facilities the reason they were is that
once we detonated the atomic bomb that
not only set up a cosmic signal that was
detected it also was the hallmark that
our civilization was potentially able to
destroy itself but also was on a
technological curve that could project
that power elsewhere in the universe to
destroy other worlds now keep in mind
there are planets
civilizations out there that are more
advanced than we are that have never had
a war they don&#39;t have weapons they have
no defenses they don&#39;t have any of that
so it is a serious problem when a
civilization reaches where we have
reached where our technological
capabilities have gone beyond our social
and spiritual development and that&#39;s
what began to happen between the early
1900&#39;s and now the last 100 years but in
the classified world they began to work
on this very aggressively I will remind
you that the top secret memo from T
Townsend Brown stated I&#39;m not T Townsend
Brown from Wilbur Smith from Canada and
51 stated that this area of research the
modus operandi he say stated of how the
UFOs work was the most secret project in
the US government exceeding the secrecy
of the development of the hydrogen bomb
now the hydrogen bomb wasn&#39;t detonated
until 52 that documents 51 you have to
ask yourself what it&#39;s more sensitive
than an h-bomb the ultimate doomsday
weapon it&#39;s these technologies and so
the security and the secrecy that began
to evolve around these systems
eventually went into the unacknowledged
super black special access project world
and beyond the reach of the Congress the
president what-have-you
fast forward to Eisenhower speech in 61
where he says as he&#39;s leaving office to
beware of the military-industrial
complex
he wasn&#39;t opposed to the militaries of
five star general he was a patriot but
he had been torpedoed and betrayed by
these fascistic elements within this
system and he knew it
he was not a stupid man so he was a
trusting person and he trusted some of
the wrong people and there&#39;s how we went
awry very badly
and so between the end of World War Two
and 1954 an enormous R&amp;D project was
involved with studying not only innate
human breakthroughs in electromagnetic
magnetic or vidiq but also it was then
joined by research reverse engineering
and studying extraterrestrial vehicles
and seeing how they work now that was a
very heavy lift because you know we&#39;re
running around with vacuum tubes right
and things like this and you&#39;re dealing
with civilizations that are
transdimensional interstellar that have
you know something this big that was
running into our city from the
zero-point field and are transferring
from through space time in a non-local
way teleporting fashion but trillions of
dollars later great progress has been
made and not just in energy generation
and propulsion that part you can
understand you&#39;re pulling energy from
the zero-point field the foundation of
space-time you create an electromagnetic
fields that are very high voltage that
create a lift effect game reach and
attained a level of or something D
materializes and teleports to another
point it&#39;s all about resonant frequency
but then they also start looking into
other things and in the process of that
found that there were technologies that
could be used that are in this
electromagnetic spectrum that interfaces
with consciousness thought I remember
Carol rosin telling me that Verner von
braun on his death beds biggest fear
beyond that of the hoaxing of an alien
invasion by this crazy component of the
intelligence community would be their
use of these electromagnetic weapons
that affect thought and consciousness on
individuals and on men
the people psychotronics radionics in
1994 I had a meeting with the man who in
the 56 had developed a system an
electromagnetic system a headset you
could put on that would enable people to
see and remote view distant places
through electronic interface basically a
technology assisted consciousness system
this was taken over by a front company
for the CIA but he described to me the
details of how this work offered me one
of these headsets I said no thank you
at this point so you have the ability
then to create all kinds of phenomenon
which I want to go through very quickly
in addition to those when we have
Michael schrott to thank for this we
have a number of items here here you
have a these are all man-made now these
are if you look they have tubes and if
you see us something that has this kind
of structure on the bottom that&#39;s not
interstellar that&#39;s northrup-grumman or
Lockheed skunkworks and they come in a
variety of sizes and shapes so there&#39;s
some that are pyramidal some that are
disc some are a triangular this is one
based on the hell on them Montana I
believe is that right no Missouri and
has sort of a grid structure here people
saw it close-up silent floating along
now to ninety-nine point nine nine nine
nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine
nine percent of the population they just
saw a UFO it&#39;s alien no it isn&#39;t coming
out of the Lockheed skunkworks
or north or Grumman or SAIC science
applications international corporation
so that&#39;s something you absolutely have
to know and you have others that look
like they&#39;re a kaboom Arang and they
have lights and structures on the
underneath side he&#39;s done a beautiful
job in detail I don&#39;t know how many
you can see it but you&#39;re welcome to see
these later the point I&#39;m making is
almost every kind of platform
rectangular triangular Chevron disk
circular that have a corollary an
extraterrestrial system devices that
have been seen attract they&#39;ve
experimented with and replicated in
classified unacknowledged special access
projects now these are highly classified
highly compartmented and meaning that if
you&#39;re not in that project you&#39;re not
going to know about it and occasionally
some information leaks out or gets out
to us and Michael stress done a great
job of collecting those what I have
found and this was beginning in the
early 90s is that those systems have a
corollary of biologically and this was
interesting to me because the reason I
was read into this project is because
they knew I&#39;m a medical doctor and I
began to look into it and I discovered
that there were a lot of a lot of these
creatures that people see again some may
be interdimensional some may be
extraterrestrial that are
transdimensional but then there are the
weird ones that are man-made and some
have called these programmed life-forms
they are bio nano machines they have
integrated circuits and their cerebral
cortex they are completely man-made and
they are under man-made control I was
his Ricci butter fest here Ricky is on
our team in Denver and he and I visited
a man outside Denver the named Stan
Romanek and Stan had had all these weird
stuff happen
he had been on TV shows and this and
that and they were opening all the doors
for him to tell his story I thought was
very curious so we went to his home and
he played a recording of
and showed us a videotape and this was
gobbled up apparently by Disney there&#39;s
one of the big studios and black shelved
but we saw it and Ricky who is one of my
assistants here
he saw it with me and it&#39;s this well it
looks like one of the Grey&#39;s totally
man-made and it&#39;s they&#39;re walking like
this kind of kind of stiff and it comes
into his kitchen he has his camera on a
camp chemical canisters thrown he didn&#39;t
know this it knocks him out in the
camera falls over and the next day he
gets a phone call because his father
apparently had been in the military from
someone who knew this was going on was
just trying to give him a heads up and
they were using a synthesized voice that
sound like a British woman and it was
saying Stan that one that happened last
night that was one of the fake ones it
was one of the fake ones and there was
the one of the investigators for MUFON
there and a couple other people and Stan
and his wife I said yes of course that&#39;s
one of the fake were they so what does
that mean I said oh for God&#39;s sakes this
had been known for forty years these are
the ones that are man-made that the UFO
subcultures say are aliens well they&#39;re
alien they&#39;re not extraterrestrial now
you&#39;re getting really worried because
everything you think you know is true
that you think is true is false and it&#39;s
part of a counterintelligence program
it&#39;s very you know your tax dollars hard
at work here folks
so think about the ability to take the
genetic material from deceased
extraterrestrial biological grow it in a
facility Dolly the sheep wasn&#39;t the
first cloned advanced life-form
but integrated circuits and have it
under the control of certain military
commanders and special operations teams
to engage in what I call here stage
craft alright and the stage craft that
you see at the top is a very
sophisticated
hated programming that involves manmade
UFOs electromagnetic warfare systems
that interface with consciousness
chemical systems and biologicals that
look like aliens but are not this is
something that everyone worries about
when they hear this because they think
well what part of everything that we&#39;re
studying and out there on the internet
and on the x-files or on the this
conference in that conference or what
have you is extraterrestrial and what
part of it&#39;s man-made
and how do you know the difference well
we just showed you up close and personal
the ones that are man-made aren&#39;t that
hard to figure out at a distance however
they&#39;re very hard to discern from an
extraterrestrial vehicle ETV and you
have to be able to have enough of this
information when you&#39;re out under the
stars making contact to have this in
your differential analysis in medicine
we call this differential diagnosis
right if you have chest pain if you&#39;re
an idiot doctor oh that person has a
heart attack well it could be pleurisy
it could be a dissecting thoracic
aneurysm it could be a dozens of things
so if you go to an incompetent physician
he&#39;ll just treat you having a heart
attack and miss the thing that CA or a
orders blowing up so I you have to have
enough knowledge
the reason this knowledge is essential
for you is that all of you are going to
be asked tonight to become ambassadors
from Earth to these civilizations you
cannot do that if you&#39;re gonna mush up
all this together in one melting pot of
undiscernible phenomenon it isn&#39;t
possible does this make sense so this is
really as far out as all this sounds and
it&#39;s big of a bridge I&#39;m trying to take
you across it is really the beginning
level this is this is what you should
have known decades ago
I found when I was studying this that
they also have the ability if you go to
some of the skunkworks programs and some
of the things that done at Montauk when
I first heard this this is about ninety
three or four from a man who had been in
really classified facility near Edwards
Air Force Base that they had electronics
where they can hook you up and you can
take you into another dimension into the
fourth ring of hell if you want to call
it that and then materialize that
creature 3d running around the lab now
some of these escaped Montauk and some
of them have escaped other places those
are not extraterrestrial they&#39;re alien
visualize technologies where that
capability exists in the hands of
sociopaths and Psychopaths using
trillions of dollars in money that&#39;s
what we&#39;re facing I&#39;m not trying to
scare you but I&#39;m trying to wake you up
this is actually what it the false flag
isn&#39;t just going to be flying in and one
of those it can also involve biologicals
psychotronic electromagnetic
materialization on and on and on now
those systems are fully operational and
have been for decades in 1997 and
actually Tony Craddock filmed these
events in Washington we were doing some
briefings and invited members of
Congress because I had given up on the
executive branch the president I had
been told by a very close friend of the
president that he didn&#39;t want to pursue
this issue because if he did he would
end up quote-unquote like Jack Kennedy
so I said well what does that mean for
me and he said well doesn&#39;t matter if
you get killed that&#39;s Washington they
don&#39;t help you welcome to Washington so
I said okay fine so then I thought well
maybe we could get a congressional
committee or chairman of
Committee to hold open hearings we
invited them wanna you know Edgar
Mitchell was there a whole lot of people
were there the day after I went and
briefed the head of intelligence with
the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the
Pentagon what was interesting is that a
man who was supposed to be one of these
dozen or so initial disclosure witnesses
when we were still not doing this
publicly but his project starlight which
was the codename for trying to get the
government to do it so that I wouldn&#39;t
have to well and so it would be official
instead of unofficial all right I mean
because I&#39;m trying to live in the rule
of law and the democracy here but so
much for that the government has
collapsed and failed on anything
important so completely collapsed so
these this man was going to account to
these members of Congress the next day
that he had been on an interagency
committee in 1974 where everything that
you&#39;re seeing here the ARVs the program
life forms interdimensional portals
psychotronic electronic holographic
systems that can be created that bring
from other dimensions things into this
world that aren&#39;t extraterrestrial but
would confuse everyone as alien that
they would hit a button he said this was
so operational you could hit a button it
would be unleashed and virtually every
man woman and child on earth would think
it was an alien attack and I said you&#39;ve
got to share this with these members of
Congress is I intend to the wee hours of
the morning some special operations
folks that he had worked with in that
command showed up at the hotel the
Westin in Georgetown and took him to an
undisclosed location
out in Virginia and held him there until
these meetings were finished before he
left he slipped a note under the door
my assistant Shari adamak at the time
who was helping me god bless her she&#39;s
passed away and he said I would love to
be able to do this for you but they&#39;re
begging me to give them time to get this
under control and not to share this
information with the members of Congress
who are going to be there and now I
still have his name and all his
information but I can&#39;t force someone
like that to go outside their command
and publicly speak about something that
sensitive because now what I&#39;m telling
you about is a thousand times more
sensitive than an ARV or you know any of
this because it&#39;s the entire agenda that
they have spent decades developing to do
what Verna von Braun warned us about and
that is that they were attempt to hoax
an alien threat to earth and by doing so
consolidate military fascist power
around the world by panicking the public
now he&#39;s told me that in 74 when he was
on this interagency committee that
system had been fully operational for
long before he was there I&#39;m guessing
from probably between 1960 and 1968 is
when it became fully operational this is
a problem my friends because what this
means is we are all sitting ducks if we
are ignorant if we know that this is
possible we can make a distinction
between the man-made false flag activity
and the actual extraterrestrial and also
distinguish that from something that may
just be an interdimensional now I have
just learned that there are two and I
mentioned this earlier fast tracked
trajectories for disclosure happening of
which I am being informed about which
I&#39;m being informed by people very highly
placed in the intelligence community I
will describe them to you the first has
to do with what I was talking about
earlier that has been unleashed
with Elizondo and that crowd and that is
to begin to acculturate people through
it a semi-official disclosure of
information but within that have it
poised that it will be a threat no
they&#39;ve gone into our nuclear facilities
and turned off our nuclear missiles yes
they have but why did they do that to
try to get us to realize that we
shouldn&#39;t go to DEFCON 1 and go into a
mutual assured destruction and destroy
all life on Earth
not because they were hostile they were
trying to save us from ourselves for
Christ&#39;s sake but here&#39;s the problem
there&#39;s another group that is racing
forward and this group is headed by one
of the four clans of the Mormon
corporate Empire but it&#39;s a breakaway
group and that this particular operation
has reached full functionality on an
anti-gravity interdimensional device as
of a few weeks ago there is a part of
the intelligence community that they
just had a meeting in Cheyenne Mountain
between the April 28th and May 5th to
discuss this and to go a go or no go on
disclosing that system as part of a
disclosure here&#39;s the problem some of
the people in that team want to present
it as an eschatological end of the world
system because one of the things that
happened in the lab out in Salt Lake
City recently was when they hit a
certain frequency not only did this
device is about the size of a basketball
when there was it levitating and had
free energy but they hit a resonant
frequency that tapped in to this these
other dimensions but lower dimensions
and all kinds of monstrous things
started coming out and they filmed it
now as soon as this happened I was
notified by these senior officials
within the intelligence community NSA
and CIA and their warning they asked
oddly for Mike
operation in with that type of
disclosure and I said yes but that&#39;s not
extraterrestrial that&#39;s alien I said you
know I knew better and the public needs
to know better and by god that&#39;s why I
did this workshop even though my
shoulders killing me
so I honestly you have to understand
this has been authorized this disclosure
trajectory&#39;s authorized now I&#39;m speaking
about it at great peril frankly personal
risk today but you have to understand
that if this rolls out the way they want
to they will try to present this as this
end of the world return a Christ sort of
phenomenon and here&#39;s the problem it was
confirmed to me that these portals into
other dimensions they have weaponized
now so the weaponization of this kind of
technology is an absolute threat to the
structure of space-time earth and
humanity and that is in the hands of a
person who I have learned is claiming to
be the return of Christ for this galaxy
I am quoting the scariest goddamn thing
I&#39;ve encountered in 28 years of doing
this and you ignore what I&#39;m telling you
and your peril now I want to go in a
little bit more into this one I was
talking about in technological
interdimensional portals because this
isn&#39;t the only lab that&#39;s done this I
was working for years with a man out of
the Huntsville Space Flight Center and
well he was actually in a skiff through
I TNT on the payroll the CIA it&#39;s all
very much you know organized that way
you know CIA to ITT
to this individuals company to this
operation he had done experiments doing
the same thing and had similar
phenomenon come into his lab I know of a
County of a device that was operational
that hit a certain frequency that poured
into the area briefly all these non et
non-human interdimensional things people
say bugger me scary I say yes scary
issue you can imagine but it&#39;s real this
is not stranger things or whatever the
NetFlow this is the real part of that
okay so when you have people who have
that technological ability but with an
agenda to hoax Armageddon or to present
a false prophet or to create earth
changes set up one of these systems over
the San Andreas Fault or between
Catalina Island and Los Angeles bang
there goes the subduction of that fault
and there goes 10 million people in Los
Angeles is that fully operational yes
fully operational I don&#39;t you know 20
years ago I said people have no idea how
dangerous an unchecked very powerful
entity is that has no supervision of the
executive the Congress or the people
doing things like this not everything
you can do should be done and you cannot
give this level of technology to an
unsupervised cabal of neo-fascists that
have been operating running amuck of our
liberties and democracy for 70 years
75 years so the reason this is such a
critical message today is that I don&#39;t
want you all to be caught flat-footed
I&#39;m hoping but it&#39;s discussing this we
can delay it and give ourselves some
time to do a disclosure that would be
beautiful and truth and move our
civilization forward not set us back to
the Stone Age or worse but it&#39;s all
in play it&#39;s all in play which brings me
to the the the sort of the last part of
this and that is a lot of people hear
this and they&#39;ll go oh god almighty I
wish you hadn&#39;t told me but there&#39;s no
time for me to I&#39;m gonna do probably
next month we&#39;ll see you in Boulder
Colorado an entire afternoon of this
because there&#39;s too much information
that has that you have a need to know
and excuse me I&#39;m trying to find
something here but ultimately we&#39;re
gonna have to figure this out ourselves
and I think that the biggest mistake
that we can make is thing is to think
that the President or some other leaders
going to do it for us but let&#39;s hope
they still do but who&#39;s gonna get their
ear first us are these operatives at the
agency us or people within the corporate
world who want in need to have this kind
of catastrophe happen this is really a
battle for the minds in the hearts of
the human race and we you know we just
cannot delay and keep delaying the truth
coming out now in a perfect world most
of what I just shared won&#39;t be known too
much for decades in terms of but we need
a vanguard of leaders you me people who
are listening on the Internet to do
something creative and this is where
Close Encounters of the Third Kind come
in because excuse me the biggest
challenge we have is the passivity of
the people get out of your smartphone
and your computers and Netflix Thank You
Netflix for
knowledge but but take some time to be a
proactive person now how do you do that
it isn&#39;t complicated now getting ready
to go tomorrow up to a wilderness area
here in Arizona we&#39;re gonna spend a
whole week where I&#39;m gonna be teaching
people the science of consciousness
meditation remote viewing the sea SETI
contact protocols and involve the mind
being able to see remote planets and
star systems and connect to their
communication devices and connect
seamlessly and then vector them guide
them in so let&#39;s go through some of
these images because I wanted to share
these with you am I in the way or we
won&#39;t be able to show a bit the audio
video but we&#39;ll be able to show some of
these cool pictures and we&#39;ll take a
quick trip I just want to give you
examples of what we&#39;ve done over the
last few years and the kind of
phenomenon that&#39;s happened this is all
about the what&#39;s going on with the space
and putting things up in space and war
and we&#39;ll just show a few of these let&#39;s
go straight through them
here&#39;s one that appeared with our group
in 92 and it&#39;s a I had a it&#39;s just a
typical reconnaissance vehicle very
unusual following one of our c5 members
outside Wichita Falls and then the next
one those were taken by Ivy blank and he
was in Santa Fe she was doing our
meditations and connecting to these
civilizations and this comes by seamless
no structure on it and it&#39;s going about
500 miles per hour
but she actually with the naked eye see
she felt it and she remote viewed it so
she took a picture but it was so fast
that she only saw it after in the in the
in the photograph and this was like pre
digital this is old film and we&#39;ve had
thousands of these sort of experiences I
love this one this was the week shortly
before the Disclosure Project event in
2001 I took a group of people to Joshua
Tree and we were in a cave meditating
and I was teaching people about the
cosmology and universal peace in the
future and this unusual how funny jerky
this unusual cobalt blue object almost
fully materializes right above us and
sherry had passed away a few years
before her color was this alt peach
salmon and her spirit body appeared in
this burst of light broad daylight
nothing esoteric about the photograph
but beautiful and it was them sort of
sending us off this was the experience
when in the meditation in the cave a
shaman cave in Joshua Tree National Park
we were told your vision must guide the
world this vision of a new world that is
at peace and is universal and has these
new technologies I love this one
his name is Bijou it&#39;s pronounced Bijou
he&#39;s an interstellar being from
Andromeda that&#39;s sort of a yarmulke here
this is his head and his left hand is
his right ones on his stomach and he
appeared outside our circle in Joshua
Tree National Park in 2009 he&#39;s wearing
what looks like glasses but they&#39;re
probably night vision and he has a very
bright looking nose because there was a
orb here that teleported him onto the
site with the naked eye the only thing
that was seen was this sphere that came
up right beside my shoulder it then went
up toward the edge of the group and we
heard four or five ETS talking and it
lit up the chairs and there was this
strange almost astral object that
appeared and with some just in
increasing the light contrast you see
him is this side of his face is brighter
than this side this is his chest and
these are his legs this is one leg he&#39;s
sort of doing this floating it&#39;s in the
air maybe five feet up and when I asked
him where he was from
we have electromagnetic systems
magnetometers that signal as a
communication system
he said it&#39;s from Andromeda galaxy and I
sense that he was enormous ly
intelligent and I said your IQ I&#39;m
sensing is around 450 equivalent human
he says yes which means I&#39;m a lower than
a Down syndrome but like a caterpillar
anyway so anyway it wonderful he&#39;s a B
shoes been with us many times on these
expeditions and now we have this a few
of these I want to go through these are
things that come in we have satellite
charts out with us and we&#39;ll see after
all satellites are not excuse me not
seen will have objects that will appear
and will signal to them and they&#39;ll
often turn and then send a light towards
us beautiful this was at Mount Shasta a
few years ago
and oh this has happened thousands of
times I can&#39;t even keep track how many
there&#39;s one that is now this is a
night-vision scope it&#39;s sort of a bluish
white light and this et I call kindness
who came to me in a lucid dream the
night that sherry adamak passed away and
was introduced to me by her in the
spirit world is in that ship she&#39;s a
very senior ambassador with an
interstellar coalition I don&#39;t know her
real name
but she was like the avatar pure kind
leanness so I named her kindness so and
these are interesting because when you
that&#39;s me
coat and we were on an expedition and
there&#39;s an object there&#39;s nothing there
apparently but then it appears and it
does what you&#39;ll see but this is a very
good quality night scope and this is
past the time you need to go out with
satellite charts and be sure it&#39;s past
the time it was actually quite close it
looks like it&#39;s far away
this one I found fascinating because we
were a few feet from us in the tree this
comes on and off what you need to know
that is transdimensional that could be
within that energy field could be an
entire spacecraft and dozens of ETS if
it were to step down into this dimension
that&#39;s what happened at Joshua Tree and
then there&#39;s one that appears my wife
was with me in this one right in front
of the tree looks like a be a crystal
clear sky it looks like a lightning and
then all around us transdimensional II
or these et beans that sort of moving
doing things with the electronics
communicating it&#39;s really beautiful this
is one of my favorite we were at Mount
Shasta and amazing camerawork by this
and gentlemen what&#39;s this thing now this
is in the unacknowledged film but they
didn&#39;t slo-mo it enough it was in the
field look at where it comes up from
it was in the it was right here we&#39;re in
the field here it comes up from here
goes straight up vertical takes a left
turn the guy swings around this is at
the edge of the speed of light this
thing look what it does it&#39;s like a worm
going in and out of space-time and
vanishes out in the space now prior to
that we&#39;ve been having all this
experience with these ETS around us and
walking amongst us when meditation high
pitch electromagnetic tones that sound
like crystal bowls ringing coming out of
thin air all kinds of beautiful
phenomena there it goes this is a light
ship as they&#39;re called they&#39;re only
called that because if they&#39;re in full
3d they&#39;d be massive extraterrestrial
vehicles but again remember they&#39;re
going through other dimensions they pass
in and out of this dimension they can
appear and disappear in a nanosecond
these are beautiful there&#39;s legends
about these this is up about 13,000 feet
the top here is 14 200 or so Mount
Shasta and people who live there have
heard of these often have never seen
them these come out from inside the
volcano and will then signal and
sometimes we have one picture there were
12 of them that emerge and on the side
of the volcano legend is that they are
the remnants of Lemuria extraterrestrial
civilization that was involved with the
big continent that was out in the
Pacific that&#39;s not called the Lemurians
I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true it very well
may be but we&#39;ve had this happen
the scariest thing we I ever had happen
on one of these expeditions we had one
of these that left the mountain and
floated towards us up at sand flats and
a high-altitude aircraft fired a scalar
electromagnetic weapon meaning faster
than the speed of light the thing Dee
materialized right before it hit and
this went into the ground felt like an
earthquake crystal clear sky burrowing
through the trees crashing and hitting
the earth going or
or shook there 15 seconds and that&#39;s
when I realized that we were all
everything we&#39;re doing is being tracked
by the intelligence community and
they&#39;re trying to do things to suppress
the content we&#39;re doing it doesn&#39;t stop
it but it that made me realize in 2004
that we had to be very aware of weapons
systems that are trained on our
expeditions next I was walking on the
beach at one of our expeditions on the
Outer Banks of North Carolina the
barrier islands this came over Raven a
friend of mine was at the house we took
it it&#39;s very ghost-like is this barely
in this dimension it was a little bit
humid but it was clear and this appeared
and she felt it and I was doing a
walking meditation on the beach when it
occurred of communicating with the ETS
which is what I like to do and it was
beautiful the night before the same
object came out of the sand we was fully
materialized we didn&#39;t have a camera
that was doing 360 and went straight
into the ocean this was it the next day
and it would appear it was about this
big at arm&#39;s length materialized D
materialized materialized immature and
then went straight into the ocean this
is at the Outer Banks and then the
following year and there&#39;s one of my
favorite we were being harassed by some
federal agents who ended up trying to
put me in prison for three years it&#39;s a
long story and welcome to my world
and this happens now if you heard the
audio we don&#39;t have audio we had these
electronic devices and as soon as this
thing materializes watch what happens
its enormous it&#39;s orange and it lights
up the entire ocean and the whole area
it was huge and there was a BB from the
electronics it then vanishes
then there are others yellow here&#39;s
another shot of it I&#39;ll show you another
one though that makes a 270 degree turn
but look when it&#39;s gone the night vision
there&#39;s nothing there
now I love this one it happens it over
and over and then this happens watch its
movement look at the angle it turns I&#39;m
not a satellite not an aircraft and it D
materializes now meanwhile we&#39;re having
around this time there teleported
energetically with their electronics and
interface with their consciousness onto
the site and they&#39;re interfacing with
people they&#39;re touching people etc and
so on some people don&#39;t like that I said
we don&#39;t come out with me people are
funny they&#39;re comfortable when it&#39;s at a
distance and when it ends up coming up
and standing beside you and then they go
oh my god human initiated contact
closest Encounters of the fifth kind
that needs to be a two-hour speech and
now we were in France and this thing
flashed in this is me and there&#39;s a way
about 60 people there was an admiral in
the military Minister of Defense who was
there incognito and this strange
ghost-like thing partially materialized
you see people turning around it was
visible with the naked eye it was not
fully there I had a puja table set up
over here which is do a Sanskrit
ceremony where I do Sanskrit and then I
do a puja and we meditate and it puts
people into a state of consciousness
that is very cosmic and that&#39;s when they
appear so they always arrive for the
puja I believe Sanskrit actually came
from another star system next
it&#39;s the endo root of all indo-european
languages now this is beautiful we were
at this on the beach and this appears
right on the sand in front of me and you
can see the ice very faintly it&#39;s barely
in this dimension
it&#39;s very crystalline pitch-black on
this Beach this would be a beautiful
cover for a book someday my sixth book
maybe but this being highly intelligent
an extraterrestrial civilization at the
level of the celestial so visualize
humanity evolving to the point that
everyone on earth were in cosmic
consciousness and enlightenment that&#39;s
what we&#39;re talking about half a million
to a billion years ahead of us
you can fill in the blanks on that next
and then we&#39;re meditating there&#39;s a is
one of my favorite this kind of
phenomenon happened we have another
picture like this at a different event
and this happens so get a load of this
we&#39;re in a deep meditation I&#39;m leading
and we&#39;re in cosmic consciousness this
is a Peruvian doctor medical doctor I
coat the cosmic spermatozoa it looks and
it comes in and it wraps around or she
begins to have the Kundalini and an
Enlightenment experience like she&#39;s
never had and of course this happens a
lot on these expeditions but we got it
on photograph in that cool yeah we got
to put this in a movie I don&#39;t know how
much people are ready for this but too
bad y&#39;all ready for this well yeah
alright next I love this one because
it&#39;s an object that we were in a on top
of Woodbury hill near Alton Barnes were
so many of the crop circle appeared the
real ones before somebody got fake and
it looks like a Sun it&#39;s just off the
edge of the hill and you see people
turning to look and it was this object
that materialized into this dimension
and lit
and then dematerialized what I saw in my
remote view was a very large craft
filled with ETS from different
civilizations that were joining us in
the meditation because that&#39;s what
they&#39;re interested in they&#39;re interested
if you have a pure heart a clear intent
and you&#39;re wanting to join them in
universal peace that&#39;s it they don&#39;t
care about your degrees they don&#39;t care
about this is what the prince of
liechtenstein said you know I&#39;ve gone
over the world where these UFOs have
seen and they&#39;re seen before I&#39;m there
and after but when I&#39;m there they&#39;re not
around maybe it&#39;s my attitude I said
bingo all right next you got that right
and we&#39;re in a crop circle here daytime
regular settings with an icon very good
camera this is my hand you see I&#39;m
pointing now no one could see this I saw
it in my remote view and also with my
celestial vision which I&#39;ve developed as
a meditator and it was this object draw
it just it&#39;s a spear in the tree in the
trees and it was watching us as we were
in this beautiful crop circle and we hit
we&#39;re about to do a meditation I love
this one because when you do any of the
he can be any tradition but anything
that is deep in consciousness and
reaching into cosmic awareness weird
beautiful things happen this is a
tubular object it comes in and lights up
the puja table this is actually one of
our electronic devices and it&#39;s all in
blue this is beautiful blue color I love
this one this is briefly in the in the
film and acknowledged we&#39;re sitting on
the land I had in Colorado and this
launches straight up from the land and
stops light [ __ ] very similar to the
object at Shasta though I call it the
corkscrew that went off but it just goes
up stops
partially in this dimension partially
not if they come too far into this
dimension they&#39;re very easily hit with a
space-based or land-based scalar weapon
which our fully operational have been
since 65 next scalar meaning
longitudinal electromagnetic and this
was on the land it&#39;s a similar event and
we&#39;re I I sense it&#39;s daytime we&#39;re out
on the land this thing lights up and
it&#39;s this beautiful golden object that
begins to emerge and I see that they&#39;re
actually in the aquifer underneath the
third largest aquifer in North America
is underneath the land there in Creston
Colorado and the ETS are in there and
come in and out of there and Blanca peak
which is the sacred mountain of the east
for the tribes of that region for Native
Americans and this appeared on the land
clear as a bell
beautiful there&#39;s nothing there&#39;s a
creek called Magic Creek the actual has
there another name but it comes down
from the tibetian stupa that the Dali
Lama asked to be built up there on the
mountain this is so amazing or at the
beach and this thing look this is 20
feet from us and we&#39;ve been having all
this contact an object appears and then
lights up and shaft of light goes upward
see it now that happens thousands of
times the problem is we usually don&#39;t
have a camera in the right direction
this time we did thank goodness now
what&#39;s behind that something very
interesting because once this vanishes
they&#39;re still there but they&#39;re wanting
you to go into these other dimensions to
commune with them and visit with them
because it&#39;s safer for them most people
want to be lazy they expect them to come
all that way and to our dimension then
sit there like a sitting duck to be shot
by these psychopaths with weapon systems
they&#39;re not going to do that yet they&#39;re
going to do this but then you can go
into their dimension this is an
Australia in 2013 and we&#39;re there
there&#39;s all kind this is an ultraviolet
camera I believe it was and we&#39;re in a
group is very kind of in rainy and messy
and very interesting objects appeared
all around us and I love this one
peaking out next and this is Bijou again
in here twice he&#39;s beautiful the energy
is so beautiful some so it&#39;s like angel
wings I said no that&#39;s the energy vortex
being held by this orb here&#39;s the orb
and it lit up this and he&#39;s there and
the group there were four or five ETS
all sounded female couldn&#39;t understand
the language you&#39;re speaking everyone
heard him speaking couldn&#39;t see them
with the naked eye on the camera they
came out this is fun we were forget
where this was I think this might be in
Arizona object they just come and came
on and off this is two years ago three
years ago I love this this was last year
up in the mountains here in Arizona what
looking what happens
materializes right there the first night
there were four in a row came on and off
and then it&#39;s clear sky here vanishes
now that happened every single night we
were up in the mountains last year we
only got this one because we didn&#39;t have
people with 360 cameras we will
hopefully this time and then we were a
Joshua Tree about a year and a half ago
and with a ultraviolet camera still
photo this huge complex is filmed and it
was it came almost every night about an
hour after any satellites were visible
and were it moved it looked like two
points of light moving that would stop
and turn it was not that far away over
Joshua Tree that&#39;s the same year we had
a what looked like a jet coming in
landing lights
sounded like a jet right above and
crystal clear sky D materialized in
front of everyone yep strange stuff next
so last year you go what the heck is
this you see this dark and air this is a
still camera a guy who took this
David Marconi he wrote enemy of the
state in a movie
the screenwriter he was there it had a
camera and I was speaking I just seen a
brilliant ruby red light appear between
two members of our team our circle
there&#39;s a about a year ago up here in
Arizona in the mountains and you can see
this darkened area the rest of this is
sort of the normal light and there&#39;s
this head it&#39;s triangular it kind of
disappears up here into the energy field
pointed chin I hear and I hear this is
like a tunic a chest and the shoulders
and abdomen and a hand here and then if
you come back a little bit you&#39;ll see
him here now what you can&#39;t see this the
Stars and there&#39;s no light next to him
is a man
edie I&#39;ll just use his first name who
had had long-term hearing loss and that
night he had contact with this et
they&#39;re sort of I have a Manta like a
praying mantis shaped head they&#39;re very
gentle and their enormous ly intelligent
their master healers and he continued
the contact with this being throughout
the night the next day he came to the
meeting in the afternoon healed his
hearing as normal still is completely
reversed his hearing loss okay all right
so those are just the sample I mean he&#39;s
a quick trip through we have thousands
of these the main thing for you to
understand is that you can do this at
home you don&#39;t need me one of the things
I is I don&#39;t like the whole well I like
being a teacher but I don&#39;t like people
be independent the problem with
organizations people get dependent on
their leaders I am not that kind of
person I&#39;m the kind of person in
medicine there&#39;s a saying see one do one
teach one what that means is you see it
done and learn the next time you&#39;re
doing it yourself and you master it and
the next time you&#39;re teaching it to
someone else
that&#39;s the model that I think is most
effective as opposed to some centralized
guru or what have you so what I&#39;m hoping
all of you will do even though of course
it&#39;s a very extensive course in
consciousness and protocols is to learn
the meditations and the CFI protocols
that involve deep meditation expanding
the mind and remote viewing making
contact and then sitting in silence and
inviting them to come for this one
purpose to be an ambassador of
enlightenment from Earth to these people
they need that they&#39;re waiting
for us they want us to do it it isn&#39;t
happening at the CIA in Pentagon and it
isn&#39;t happening at the White House or
Congress or the United Nations and I&#39;ve
tried so we have to be the Vanguard
showing to these civilizations all that
is good about humanity and the promise
of the human future that&#39;s that good
future and how do you do it you go out
without fear and without prejudice fully
aware of the cosmology that I introduced
you to but with discernment and make
contact with these civilizations I tell
people I&#39;ve done this in an organized
way for 28 years I started having direct
contact using the ce-5 Close Encounters
the fifth kind protocols that I
co-created with ETS onboard a spacecraft
in 1973 when I was just turned 18 what I
tell people is that I have never had any
harm come to me or anything but
beautiful except at the hands of humans
masquerading as alien so just keep in
mind on your canary in the mine shaft
and I&#39;m still twittering so and don&#39;t
let fear overtake the vision of the good
future that awaits us all right now
before we close then the lights can come
up if you like I&#39;m going to pretend and
so or each of you that you are a head of
state or the head of United Nations or
what have you and I&#39;m going to share
with you this rough draft of what I&#39;ve
asked the right and what I hope will
excuse me be delivered I mean a horse
and it&#39;s a little bit it&#39;s brief but the
people don&#39;t listen to things that are
long and so it&#39;s two pages
instead of well our textbooks in
medicine or 2,000 pages so you know
anyway so I&#39;m going to actually a page
and a little bit more so forgive me for
reading but I&#39;m gonna do it is that
alright so you can do it kind of pretend
visualize you&#39;re an enlightened world
leader who wants to see this happen and
if not visualize yourself as the world
leader making this happen creating your
own reality all right so hmm it should
be on teleprompter
my fellow Americans or my fellow
Russians or you can fill in the blanks
and all the citizens of the earth it has
come to our attention that
extraterrestrial civilizations of great
technological advancement have been
visiting the earth for some time while
their presence likely dates from very
ancient times the modern era since world
war ii has seen a large increase in
sightings and interactions with these
advanced life forms and their spacecraft
it must be emphasized that they appear
to pose no threat to humanity or earth
but instead are quite concerned about
our own unchecked war making
capabilities and violence combined with
our early attempts at the exploration of
space since the dawn of the nuclear
error these extraterrestrial
civilizations have made concerted
efforts to do reconnaissance at all
known space and nuclear facilities in
some cases these facilities have been
penetrated by ET craft and our nuclear
missiles rendered inoperable such
incursions appear designed to warn us
not to use these world destroying
nuclear weapons and are not acts of
hostility they also appear concerned
with the rapid decay of our environment
and biosphere and the extinction of many
species on earth since world war ii
there have been extremely secretive
projects studying the energy
communication and propulsion systems of
these extraterrestrial spacecraft it is
time for us to disclose these momentous
scientific findings to you these
technology
technologies have the potential if used
only for peaceful purposes to give us a
new and sustainable civilization on
earth free of poverty and pollution
within a generation since World War two
I&#39;m sorry however if used for
destructive and violent purposes these
same technologies could end our
civilization for this and other reasons
the strictest secrecy has surrounded the
study of these extraterrestrial
technologies but the time has arrived
for the truth to be known we are not
alone in the universe and it is time for
humanity to become a mature peaceful
civilization and take its place in the
cosmos with other advanced peoples from
other star systems to this end I call on
the world community other world leaders
in all the people of the earth to come
together and begin this new era on earth
we must make open peaceful contact and
initiate diplomatic ties to each of
these civilizations we must do this as
children of the earth and not just as
one nation all nations and people of
Earth must be represented and empowered
in this process we must commit to
keeping all weapons out of space and
going only into space for peaceful
purposes that benefit all of humanity we
must bring forth these advanced energy
and propulsion technologies so that the
world&#39;s environment and people benefit
we must all agree to never allow these
new technologies
to be used as weapons of war and we must
commit amongst ourselves that if any
nation or group attempts to use these
technologies for violent or destructive
purposes every nation and people on
earth will rise up to immediately stop
it we face a choice if we do nothing our
environment and civilization will
degrade and we may face extinction if we
use these new this new knowledge and
science for war and destruction
we will also surely perish but if we
establish a world of peace humanity can
now advance as a civilization that is
sustainable just and worthy of exploring
the universe this is the singular and
great challenge of our generation to
establish world peace and to create a
new sustainable civilization on earth
once we have achieved this foundation of
peace and justice we have learned that
these other civilizations will welcome
us in the cosmos with open arms and
hearts so my fellow citizens of Earth
let us work together to achieve the
destiny of humanity an enlightened
peaceful world that joins her place
among among the other peoples of the
cosmos for this is the only possible
good future for Humanity it is time for
us to unite as a people and create that
good future now
so that&#39;s my draft of what I&#39;d like to
see the president and Putin and everyone
else addressed the world with it&#39;s a
little bit it was how many minutes five
ten that&#39;s about all you can handle
in the media so you all can you know I&#39;m
gonna eventually you know refine this
this is that was done at 5:00 a.m. but
what I want you to visualize is this
happening not the false flag and not the
other we have to create that reality
this is possible and there has to be
some possibility because I&#39;ve had two
people one close to the President of
Russia and one that is in the national
security system the United States very
high up who is in charge of disclosure
asked me to write something like this
for president Trump so it is very
important for us to understand there&#39;s
potential for progress not give up never
really my um the other thing I want you
to do visualize is that regardless of
what happens with these politicians and
the power elite and the media and the
buffoonery and the fake disclosure
efforts you control your own destiny
we&#39;re all in this together but you can
join together with two three four or
five people where you live and become a
team making contact as an ambassador to
these people and you can do it tonight
and you can do it every night turn off
your television go out under the stars
meditate and because the only thing
these civilizations are looking for is a
pure heart clear intention and the great
purpose they&#39;re not interested in
entertaining you like dolphins at
SeaWorld there&#39;s enough photographs and
images and what-have-you
they really want people to work with
them who are enlightened who understand
the cosmos who understand the conscious
universe and will understand that we are
have begun a period on earth that has
the potential to become the most
developed civilization that has ever
been on earth in the four billion years
that&#39;s existed we also have the
potential to destroy this planet so it&#39;s
very important that all of us come
together and lock arms and create this
new world thank you very much I
appreciate you coming
