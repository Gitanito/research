  		              		Experience Description   

    I arrived in the operating room for an external tumour  located between the vaginal mesh and the intestines, and went out via the uterine opening. 
  
  The  appearance of the tumour was sudden and it was assumed that it was encapsulated. But what the surgeon found was a tumour that  branched around the  lower organs, and was eating into the wall of the uterus. The surgeon was doubtful whether to close and prescribe radiation therapy, or to try to remove the branches. He decided on the latter. Everything was going well, the surgeon and his team were happy how the process was going. But in an instant I died. They couldn't understand it, and started to resuscitate me for 7 minutes.

   I didn't see my body when I left it.  I saw a place devoid of light but full of love and peace. I was accompanied by Beings, despite not being able to  see them.  I was aware of the Beings and that this was  something fantastic. I felt in my mind that one of them was talking to me. It was in a masculine voice that was very sweet and soft, with lots of love. He told me that  my life on earth had ended. He told me that I had lived my life well and that  for this reason, they were giving me a choice. He asked me if I would  like to stay here with them or if I would  like to return. The memory of my three daughters came to my mind and I heard myself say, 'I would like to return to my daughters. They need me.' Then he said, 'Well! We are going to explain to you, how to do it.'  I felt my energy body as if it was  liquid. It was  draining towards my physical body, and penetrating my body  through the head. In my mind, they continued talking to me. These Beings were showing me that I would enter slowly, so as not to have too much pain. 

   On opening my eyes, the doctors looked at me. Shocked, the surgeon was the first to speak. He  asked me if I remembered my name. I answered  perfectly. On moving me from the operating room  towards the ward, my husband came up to me. In that moment, and on seeing him I didn't recognise him as he was. To me, he was my brother. I only recognised my daughters and my mother. The rest was a mixture of feelings, and others that I don't remember. The feeling of peace was indescribable. But on returning home, day by day the feeling was fading. I fell into a great state of anguish because of my feelings and what was I doing here. Everything was making me take big decisions and drastic decisions in my life.  I divorced,  moved home, my daughters were coming all over with me. I had to return to living with my parents, and everything guided me to study Reiki. There I took the big healing step of finding my own path, and feeling good. Then they guided me to be a Reiki master. I studied other therapies, and I learned to channel and connect myself with these Beings who had received me when I had died.
  
  I found my purpose in life. They said to me that they weren't going to give me the choice of another body as time was short.  I should look for my wisdom, and my studies, to others, and through them utilise the same body, but re-energise. It was another life but in the same body. I  would take the previous life as a past life. I learned a lot from them through the years.
