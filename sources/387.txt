 1/1, March 1933-2003.  $3.00 a year.  Beginning in May 1934 the title became American Astrology Magazine.  This was the longest running American astrological journal.    The journal notably carried Marc Edmund Jones's 11-part article "The Science of the Ages"in 1939, as well as contributions by Dane Rudhyar and many others.  The journal contained the usual didactic articles, day-to-day guides for the signs, comment on world events (”practically certain"Wendell Willkie will win 1940 presidential election), horoscopes of notable people, etc.  Carl Payne Tobey in his "Memories and Recollections"says that Clancy had in 1932 before published one of the first astrological magazines (unnamed) in Detroit), that lasted six months.  When Clancy started this journal the next year (on a $1,000 loan from a typesetter -- that repaid $250,000) he hired Tobey, although their philosophies notably differed: "Clancy was a Mystic.  He was a man with a destiny.  What he was trying to do, scientists didn't know how to do.  He told me, ‘I am going to make America astrology conscious.'  Frankly, I don't know how he did it, but he did." Biographical notices on Clancy often note that he started this journal in 1923, but they are incorrect.  Clancy is also notable for hiring appellate lawyers for Bruno Hauptmann after his conviction for kidnapping the Lindbergh baby.  Clancy also published the American Journal of Astrology.  Advertised in L'Astrosophie, December 1939.
