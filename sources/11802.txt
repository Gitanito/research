  		              		Experience Description   

    For past 2 years I have been  recovering from foot injury, had surgery and was still suffering from pain. I was prescribed 2 new non-narcotic pain medications and it was my first day taking them.  

  On January 1, 2021, I did some yoga and meditation on the floor. I had  my mala,  ruby, and garnet rocks. The rocks in my hands got so hot. While meditating, I briefly saw all my past and present lives. It was like an acknowledgment of all my existences and felt natural to recall these multi-life memories.
  
  I was used the mantra, 'I know what I want. I know who I am.  I need your help (angels and universe) to achieve my dreams'.  

  Then my son called me and I had to stop what I was doing. I thought that I will quickly get up and act normal.  I got up too fast.  This caused me to become dizzy, so I tried  to hold onto a door frame.
  
  Then all became wavy, like when  lying down in a boat wih the  waves  rocking it gently.  There was  a very bright light above me. It felt like I was looking at the star, but from a distance of only a few feet. The light gave off bright purple and white colored rays colored. It was pleasant there.  I saw and felt my body just stripped off my shoulders, like a sleeve or a  soft shell removed from my body that folded and fell down on the floor. I'm not sure if I saw anything Beings. 
  
    I literally felt separation from the body, but wasn't afraid of the process. It was like there were two  separated entities. There was me standing up and the body lying on the floor.  The body fell from me like a sleeve or  a coat.  

  I heard my son calling repeatedly, 'Mom, are you ok?' and I was trying to reconnect back to my body. I felt like I was entering through the open mouth,  like when  sucking a drink through a straw. I got back into my body and was trying to settle back inside my body's chest. 
  
   I was scared for my son and didn't want him to see my unconscious body.    Later, my son told me that it looked like my body was having  seizures as  my body was shaking. If it was not for him, I would have not come back.   The light was so comforting.

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Jewish.   I'm a believer, but don't follow traditional religious rituals. I am exploring past-life possibilities and different spiritual modalities.  

What is your religion now?         Jewish   I'm still learning about spiritual modalities  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     The concept of splitting into two  entities was absolutely new.   As an RN who worked with terminal patients, I held hands of dying people hundreds of times.

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.     What I felt is that there is no death, just existence  with or without body. It felt that the body is my current sleeve and I learned that I had many sleeves before.  

  Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     That we are spirit, light, the physical body is just the way to be on this planet. The moment when the body detached from me is indescribable. The body felt like a sleeve,  a cape, or a coat. It just detached and fell off me.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     I came to know that everything is going to be ok.  I need to stay for my kids and for those who I will meet in the future as they depend on me staying.

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  As time passes, now I start to forget that feeling of the moment when body detached from me. But that evening after I 'came back,' I remembered it clearly.

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The understanding of the soul and body symbiosis  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Immediately after with my husband.  He didn't really understand what I was talking about.   The next day with my friend, who is an intuit and psychic,  she validated my experience.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     Don't know yet how to respond
