  		              		Experience Description   

    Our canoe overturned and I slipped into the cold lake. Not knowing how to swim, I panicked at first, but soon became calm as I drowned after sinking and swallowing water. I felt so peaceful that I thought to myself, 'This is not so bad!' 

    I was pulled into and part-way through a tunnel where I was surrounded by a brilliant yellowish-white light. I had not yet made it to the end when suddenly all faded and I was swooshed back out of the tunnel. I lost all memory of the event until well after I was rescued when I awoke in my underwear under a blanket beside a campfire.
