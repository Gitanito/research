Hi,   I found your website, and would like to share my story. While I am young (just   20) I have been lucky enough to have met my true soulmate almost 2 years ago now   who I have the most incredible, amazing magical connection I ever dreamed   possible with someone. I am a very deep soul, and so is he, and we had both   dreamed about exactly what our soulmate would be like 7 years ago, and we were   the person the other was dreaming about all those years ago. It is truly   incredible! I have been with him for a year and a half now. So here is my story: &nbsp;

When   I first met him around&nbsp;2 years ago we had both come from really&nbsp;difficult past   relationships&nbsp;in which&nbsp;our exes had lied and cheated on us, and since then 7   years ago we dreamed of our perfect dream person, and we had all the qualities   we wanted to find in each other that the other one wanted. He had always wanted   to find one of those rare girls who was a true friend who he could truly trust   and love and who also loved vocal trance music and had the same beliefs, and I   wanted someone with all his qualities. He was exactly what I had described when   I wrote down what my dream guy would be like 7 years ago. I wanted someone who   was always understanding, supportive,&nbsp;a very deep soul, someone not shallow,   someone who I&nbsp;would give me the most amazing endless feeling of joy in my soul   every single time I thought of them,&nbsp;someone I&nbsp;could trust who was a true friend   and he was everything&nbsp;I ever dreamed of and&nbsp;beyond even. We had both agreed that   if we were to&nbsp;ever find our soulmate and commit to anyone again that person   would have to show us they were a true and trustworthy friend first, and that's   exactly what we did. We become best friends for the&nbsp;first 6 months we knew&nbsp;each   other, and found out we were almost exactly alike in every&nbsp;single way, our soul   essences just seemed&nbsp;to match perfectly. An important thing I want to mention is   that true friendships are the most important thing to both of us, and we proved   to each other that we would be there for each other no&nbsp;mater what, and that we   always would&nbsp;want what was best for the other, and be a&nbsp;true friend to the other   forever no matter what happened. We're not only lovers, but the closest best   friends anyone could ever imagine.&nbsp;And I even found this journal he had online,   and he said the most amazing things anyone has every written about me. And he   still has no idea I saw what he wrote about me, but he wrote this before he came   to visit me for the first time this summer: &nbsp;  

  	Tommy. So yes, as of right now, my fateful journey up to North Carolina to   	see my soulmate is going to take place :) I honestly do believe Crystal is   	that one special someone for me, if only you guys could understand how happy   	I know this girl will make me! Hopefully it's not just the internet talking,   	but one of her goals in our relationship is to make me as happy as I can be,   	and come on, how often do you hear that in a relationship nowadays? Maybe   	it's just cause I'm used to Knob relationships...haha! I've just never been   	in a relationship where I give everything I have and in return get the same!   	The only relationship I still to this day can only remember is Megan and I's   	(Go figure right...lol!) And I know for a damn fact I did things for her   	that I would have never done for anybody else...there's some serious shit on   	that list of things too...lol! But I never got the same in return...no   	matter what I did out of my way for her, she never did the same, and it   	almost made me feel like that's how ALL relationships are, hopefully I'm WAY   	wrong and Crystal is everything I've been looking for in a woman, and so   	far, ohhh yeah, plus she's been showing me more and more pictures of her   	lately, and oh my...hehe, she's so beautiful and attractive, it's unreal!

  Crystal is my everything right now and I refuse to do anything in this   relationship that could end us...I'm too in love with this girl!! hehe! Alrighty,   that's the update in my life, well Crystal wise &nbsp;

And   when I asked him how he would describe me he knew me, and described me exactly   the way I had always dreamed my true soulmate would, he said: &nbsp;  

  	Tommy: my soulmate, perfect, everything I've ever dreamed of in a girl...but   	people already know that anyhow cause that's what I tell them, but if your   	talking personality wise, your extremely deep and know what's true in your   	soul, and you strive for everything when it comes to your goals

Just   wanted to share the story of how I met my soulmate, hope it was inspiring! :) &nbsp;
