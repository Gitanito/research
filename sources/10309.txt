  		              		Experience Description   

    While in the back of an ambulance during transport from one hospital to another, my heart stopped.
  
  I don’t remember being put in the ambulance or very much of what took place between the time of having the stroke and my NDE. I also do not remember very much of what took place after the NDE and the following day. For some reason the NDE is really the only thing I remember clearly.

  I was in the back of the ambulance and I remember the typical 'out of body' experience. I was above and looking down at myself on the stretcher. I did not see what was happening to me or what the paramedic was doing. Instead, I saw my mom, who had passed away only a few months prior. She was sitting down. She was not upset or panicked. Rather she had a sense of being very calm and she had a quietness. Somehow we spoke to each other or rather she spoke to me. She told me that there wasn’t anything she could do to change the outcome of what was going on and that what happened was out of her control. She told me that whatever was going to be, that I wouldn’t go through it alone because she was going to be there with me. 

  The next thing I remember was looking up at the paramedic over top of me.  A couple of days later, I woke up in the Johns Hopkins Nero center. When I could finally talk, I reluctantly told my friend  what happened. Luckily, she  was an emergency room nurse and was with me when I had my stroke. As I began to tell her what had happened in the back of the ambulance, she stopped me with this look on her face. She  took a notebook from the drawer in the bedside table and showed me a picture. She said when I first got into the room, I asked her for something to write on. She didn't realize what the picture was until I started to tell her. I had drawn a picture of what I saw about what had happened in the back of the ambulance. It was a picture of me lying on the stretcher and my mom was there with me.
