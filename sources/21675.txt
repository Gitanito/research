THE ROSICRUCIANS
Basts of
This Right
The possession of this power
and authority was obtained by
the various leaders, teachers and
Priests of the Fraternity; by right of having legiti-
mately enrolled in the august Fraternity; by having
been properly and thoroughly instructed, fully train-
ed, and finally Initiated; also by right of being
properly authorized and commissioned, prior to the
institution of the Order on American soil and by
the continuous existence of the Order since its estab-
lishment.

A Trial and In 1872, while Dr. P. B.
an Admission Randolph, then the Supreme
Grand Hierarch of the Rosi-
crucians, lived in Boston, and long years before any
other association in America or any of her posses-
sions attempted to use the name Rosicrucian in one
or another of its variations, some of Dr. Randolph's
enemies tried to ruin him and his work and the
Order. The prosecuting Attorney, during the course
of making his charge to the jury, said:
"Over twenty years ago, Dr. Randolph was
known to be a Rosicrucian, and in that period
he ascended the steps of the mystical brother-
hood, outstripping the thousands and rushing
past hundreds of gray-beards in the mental race,
until he attained the chieftainship of the true
Rosicrucians in America and the Isles of the
Sea, and finally to the Supreme High Priest-
hood of the Order, and the Grand Mastership

Setting aside the admitted twenty years prior to
1872, there is no record of any other association of
men functioning as Rosicrucians, and in addition
to the proofs by Copyright and in existing books,
this public trial and its records prove beyond con-
tradiction, the existence of the Order, the undisputed
authority of the said Dr. P. B. Randolph as
Supreme Hierarch, and his right to appoint his own
successor, teachers and Priests, and the consequent
illegality of any other man, or body of men, forming
an association, or associations, and using the name
or title Rosicrucian, unless appointed by Dr. P. B.
Randolph or his legitimate successors.
During Dr. P. B. Randolph's Grand Mastership,
the SEE and the House of SS. of the Triple Order,
was located in San Francisco, Boston, and Toledo,
in the order named. During the life of Freeman B.
Dowd, the SEE and the House of SS of the Triple
Order was located in Arkansas first, and later in
Mexico. With the induction of Dr. Edward H.
Brown into the chair of Grand Master, several
changes were made and the SEE and House of SS. of

If it be our duty to fight (overcome) any one 1
evil, then each and every evil should have like at- \
tention at our hands, and those evils which affect
the soul even to its destruction, as do false occult'
teachings—which are the most greatly destructive, i
should have our first attention.
Students who, without vigorous protest, permit
false teachers to flourish, teachers who even clothe
themselves with the names of honored associations,
names to which they have no right,—such students
are disloyal to their Order and their Master; they
are negatives or semi-negatives, and in great danger
of falling under the sway of the Black Brotherhoods ,
and their illusive doctrines and seductive but false ,
promises.!
Evil must be met face to face and handled without
gloves. To compromise is to be lost. That which'
is, either is right or wrong—there is no middle path.

mitted by practical action—as note when he chas-

The beginning of the Rosicru-

such, dates from the seventeenth
century when Johann Valentin Andrea (not Lord
Francis Bacon as erroneously claimed by some un-
informed writers), signing himself Christian Rosen-
kreuz, published a number of pamphlets dealing
with the mystical teachings of Societies (the Her-
metics and Paracelsians) then in existence but of
which little was known. The mystically inclined

Rosicrucian body in America, that founded by Dr.

the exception of one instance, since become void,
this body has given authority to no other association

The Rosicrucian Order, august as

in the Spiritual Hierarchy. The
Rose Cross is the primary training school wherein
is taught a sublime philosophy, a law of justice, the
principle of Compensation, the necessity of Manhood
and non-interference with the rights of other men.
In its training, the Rosy Cross leads the gross man
by degrees from the purely physical-carnal to the
verity of the spiritual. It instructs man in the
process of transmutation, so that he can, by his own
efforts, transmute the base into the fine, the dross
into pure gold. This process gradually results in
Illumination. Man proves to himself through this
method that he does possess a Soul, and the location
where the Soul (the living fire) has its center. Man
becomes a son of the gods, and his next step is to
contact the Hierarchies in the heavenly realms. He

The Rosicrucian Order
The Rosicrucian has been since its ^
Order a School ginning in the past
ages, and especially so since the change from an
Hermetic appellation to that of the Rosy Cross, a
school of philosophy and divine science, and a train-
ing center for spiritual development. The whole
aim of this ancient Brotherhood has had in view
the transmutation of the gross, carnal man into a
highly developed spiritual, albeit practical, normal
being. It has for its Great Work, the spiritualiza-
tion of the material, physical man so that Illumina-
tion (Initiation) may take place, and that man
may find himself a living Soul. The Rosicrucian
Order is, we repeat, a spiritual school, and as point-
ed out by one who signed himself Christian Rosen-
kreuz, aims at the spiritual marriage (the balancing
of the Spiritual and the material) within man,
which is to make him both man and as one of the
gods.

publicity therewith, and only the most ignorant have
been foolhardy enough to proclaim their member-
ship. The Temple of Eulis and the Priesthood of
.(Uth have thus far been free from these parasites
and it is hoped that, due to the protection, fraternal
and legal, given these associations of men, they
will so remain and not be dragged into the mire as
has the Rosy Cross.
The
Authority
As in the Rose Cross, where
authority is conferred through
two channels, so with the Tem-
ple of Eulis and the Priesthood of JEth. Those
Aspirants who seek to become members, must first
enroll as Neophytes and become proficient in the
history and the philosophy of the Order, for the
Fraternity seeks only those who truly desire to be-
come Masters, and accepts none who, due to ignor-
ance, would be mere appendages, slaves, followers.
These applicants must pass, therefore, through the
trial chambers of development; when they have
finally attained their full status as members, earned
by their own deliberate and conscious efforts and
inner growth, they may be appointed as teachers and
Priests. Thus it will be recognized that men must
be prepared within the school, thoroughly trained in
every department of the Great Work, and then,
through a line of descension, as from Grand Master

The T^umber
of Degrees
Seekers after truth and Initia-
tion have been offered by pseudc
teachers the privilege, through
the payment of certain fees or dues, large or small,
as the case may be, of being initiated into from one
to twelve degrees, each one of which was supposed
to make the applicant a member of the Order and
therefore a Rosicrucian. Such a procedure is a
parody on all that is sacred and sublime. Though
a man were to be "initiated" into a thousand cere-
monial degrees, he would be no more a Rosicrucian
than he had been before the "initiation." A man
cannot be made a Rosicrucian, he must become one
through a process of inner growth, a spiritualization
which is known as the transmutation of the gross
into the fine. In no other way than by growth, an
actual inner development, does one ever become a
Rosicrucian and a member of the august Fraternity.
The true Rose Cross consists of but three de-
grees, or three distinct steps of growth, the highest
of which is known to the true student and seeker as
the Exalted Third. In the first degree, he finds his
own Center of Light, gains the absolute knowledge
that he is a living Soul. In the second degree, he
comes into touch or communion with the Spiritual

rr"^e So blindly ignorant are these charla-
tans and their dupes of the real mean-

are unaware that its main symbol, the Rose, is an
emblem meaning silence. From the earliest time the
rose has been the emblem of silence. Eros, in the
Greek mythology, presented a rose to the god of
silence, and to this day sub rosa, or "under the rose,"
means to keep a secret. The Rose Cross, mystically
interpreted, means: To keep silent before the Cross.

Many who sin-

Of these the greater number fall by the wayside.
Why? Because they do not possess the strength and
the manhood—or womanhood—to think, desire and

development, and freedom from slavery . to self and

to praise and glorify. Frequently faults^ and weak+

weakness and degradation. In some instances, or in
some special work, it may appear to prove profitable
to the promptors, but in the Great Work it cannot
find place. WHY? Because as stated, we all ulti-
mately must pay for that which we receive, and to
accept that for which we have not made a propor-
tionate exchange, at once makes us weaklings who
shun our duty, and dishonest at heart because we
accept that which does not belong to us, and the
man or woman who is not honest at heart cannot
become an Initiate, or a Rosicrucian. Even if some-
one else were to pay, that does not save or excuse the
one who receives without making the righteous ex-
change, though it might compensate the workers
or teachers; and it would, at the same time, make
these workers dishonest in that they permitted a
wrong. The Rose Cross is based on Law, self-
endeavor, and above all, self-responsibility.

Authority
In no instance, and under no

grant authority (a Charter) to men in another
country to establish a branch of the said Order in
said foreign country, unless there does not exist in
that country an Order functioning under the same
or a similar name. For illustration: If there is a
Rosicrucian Order, Fraternity, or Brotherhood in
France, then the legitimate Order in America could
not, under any terms, except by express permission
of the Order already functioning in France, grant
a Charter to applicants from France. To attempt
to do so, would at once stigmatize the American
Order as clandestine, since it is guilty of not respect-

the French, Spanish or Swiss Order, under any
pretext, can grant a Charter to any man, or asso-

cians, because it is known to all students, and
provable by published documents, that an Order of
that title has existed in America since 1857.

As a matter of fact, the leaders of clandestine

inadvertently admit it in their literature. For ex-
ample, one of these organizers, when engaged in
establishing his illegitimate progeny, made the claim

body finds itself at odds with another organization,
almost as lacking in authority and legitimate exist-

the ranks of the former by reason of a much finer
ritual. What is the result? In an article published
in its magazine November 1927, eleven years later,
purporting to give the history of the true Order, the
same writer says:

Incorporation
?iqt Sufficient
Men who have never been
enrolled with the true
Rosicrucians, who had re-
ceived no instructions, much less training in the
Order, and therefore who could not obtain legitimate
authority to establish Rosicrucian centers, lodges,
temples, circles or colleges, have attempted to over-
come this handicap by incorporating their associa-
tion. Incorporation does not grant an authority not
previously possessed. To make this plain even to a
novice, let us say that a number of men might
fraudulently gain possession of the Masonic ritual
(by eavesdropping or betrayal by a Mason) and
could justly claim to be in possession of the Masonic
knowledge, yet the fact that they were in possession
of this knowledge and associated themselves together,
and obtained a State charter under a Masonic name,
would in no sense give them the authority—the right
and privilege to initiate men and style themselves
Masons. The first requisite is that they be legiti-
mately made Masons, that they be in good standing,
and that they obtain the rights and privileges from
the established authority within that jurisdiction,
and then to incorporate, or operate (incorporation
not necessary) under that Charter. To attempt tc

who deliberately steal from them their name and

purpose and who are capable of fulfilling this duty

A peculiar, though natural
phase of the matter is that
all these claims are made
by the man who, in 1915
established a pseudo-order and asserted at the time,
without qualification, in his literature, magazines
and newspaper interviews, that prior to the time he
established the Order there had existed no Rose
Cross in America, and that he had been called to
a foreign country to receive his authority.
In this man's official magazine under publication
date of November, 1927, the statement is made:
"The Headquarters have been established in
many Eastern localities since the dawn ot
Rosicru danism in America in 1662, and in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries there
were national Headquarters located at various
times in Philadelphia, Germantown, Ephrata,
Pennsylvania, in New York, Baltimore, Boston
and other cities."
In a still later publication, entitled "Some facts
(Sic) about the Rosicrucians," he states:
"And, lastly, the Order is closely allied with
the early history of America and is one hun-
dred per cent American in this land. It was
first established in America in 1694 and its
original buildings still stand in Fairmont Park,
Philadelphia. Among its early officers were

THE ROSICRUCIANS
Had Knowledge of
the Legitimate Order
with him and the pseudo-order was hatched.
* * *
This man had
knowledge of the
legitimate Order
which had long been established. We again quote
from his official literature, the identical booklet from
which the former quotation was made:
"This is why the attempts of Dr. Randolph and
one or more other Rosicrucians of foreign
initiation to establish the Order in this country
within the past hundred years have always
failed. The necessary cooperation and priv-
ilege could not be secured, even regardless of
the fact that Dr. Randolph was one of the
foremost men of the Order who ever lived in
this country and was at one time GRAND
MASTER OF THE R. C. Lodge of France,
which was attended by one of the Napoleons
[emphasis ours]."
Just a question: If Dr. Randolph was, as here
admitted, the Grand Master of the Rosicrucians in
France, to whom could Dr. Randolph have applied
for authority to establish the Order in America when
he returned and found no Order established here?
Was his authority as a Grand Master, not sufficient
to permit him to establish the Order in any country
where it had not previously existed, there being no

which had long been established. We again quote
from his official literature, the identical booklet from
which the former quotation was made:
“This is why the attempts of Dr. Randolph and
one or more other Roeleruclane of ioreign
initiation to establish the Order in this country
within the past hundred years have always
failed. The necessary cooperation and priv-
ilege could not be secured, even regardless of
the fact that Dr. Randolph was one or the
foremost men of the Order who ever lived in
this country and was at one time GRAND
MASTER OF THE R. C. Lodge of France,
which was attended by one of the Napoleons
[emphasis ours].”
Just a question: If Dr. Randolph was, as here
admitted, the Grand Master of the Rosicrucians in
France, to whom could Dr. Randolph have applied
for authorityto establish the Order in America when
he returned and found no Order established here?
Was his authorityas a Grand Master, not sufficient
to permit him to establish the Order in any country
where it had not previously existed, there being no
higher office than that of Grand Master? This
writer and founder of a pseudo-order, strangely,
does not claim to ‘have been a Grand Master, he
claims (which is here denied) that he was merely

an Initiate, yet he receives authority to establish a
Grand Lodge of the Order!

never been even enrolled as Neophytes in the Rose
Cross, and who can know nothing of its inner
teachings or laws, the claim is made that the Order
is International. This is contrary to every Law of
the Order. The Supreme Grand Lodge or Hierarch-
ical organization of each country is separate and
independent, and the officers of the Grand Lodge of
one country have absolutely no authority in the
government of that of another country. The one
exception was that of Count Gouinotti, in his selec-
tion of Dr. James R. Phelps as head of the Rose
Cross Illuminati and was authorized and legitimate
due to the fact that the Illuminati had not been
established in America prior to this act.

a matter of record, the official body frowns on any

adversely react on the Order. Moreover, to do this,

Irrespective of the false-
hoods published, the Rose
Cross publish no books.
It is true that the teachers and perceptors recom-
mend certain books to students, insist, even, that
these students procure them and study them. This
is because such books teach the philosophy and the
history of the Order. This, we maintain, is as
necessary and honorable as it is for a student of
medicine to study the text books of his particular
school so that he may become well versed in all the
knowledge that has been accumulated during times
past and may be wholly proficient in his particular
line of endeavor. The true Rose Cross encourages
its students to investigate, and would, if legally pos-
sible, send every seeker to the Library of Congress
there to investigate priority of existence and all other
facts connected with the Order. The Rose Cross
derives no profit from the books it recommends de-
spite all innuendoes published and promulgated by
the leaders of clandestine organizations in order to
justify themselves and detract attention from their

activities. As a matter of fact, these questions are
raised to becloud the issue and to hide the real
facts relative to the genuine Rosicrucians and their
work, and with the intent to prevent their followers
from reading published books and thereby possibly
learning the truth. As an example: the Masonic
Publishing Companies may advertise books and texts
dealing with Masonic Philosophy, History and
Usages, written by men recognized as authorities on
the subject; even so, legitimate publishing houses
may print, advertise and sell books dealing with the
known history and philosophy of the Rosicrucians,
both ancient and modern, but the Order may not
advertise itself, as an Order; and may not appear
in print.

All Aspirants who seek to enroll in
the Great Work must first secure
and read: The Rosicrucians: Their
Teachings; The Philosophy of Fire; The Rose Cross
Order. Why? Because these books teach the phil-
osophy and the history of the Order and it is the
desire of the Fraternity that each applicant shall be
fully informed before entering the School so that
there shall be no disappointment. It is the wish of
the Order that each Neophyte become a foundation
stone in the Great Structure and this would be im-
possible if the student were not fully conversant

THE PHILOSOPHICAL
PUBLISHING COMPANY
The Philosophical Publishing Company has been
in the book publishing business for more than
twenty-five years and is justly proud of its record
and its known policy of fair dealing.
This Company has issued in the past, and is still
so engaged in issuing, cloth-bound books that sell
at $1.00, actually for less than the cost of produc-
tion. It does this so that those with little money
may possess the best of books. In common with
high class publishers of fine books, it issues some
of these books in de luxe style, printed on fine paper,
deckle edged, leather bound and, according to style,
priced from $10.00 to $50.00 or more, per copy.
The one dream of this Company has been and
continues to be, that the day may dawn when it will
be in position to issue the world's most beautiful
books and at a cost proportionate to their rarity and
beauty. It believes that if the lay reader is willing
to pay immense prices for books of prose or poetry,
then surely there are students who desire what they
deem "priceless treasures" to be issued in equally
beautiful style.

also. However, this Company has no official con-
nection with the Rosicrucians. It does not claim
that any of the books, not even the private or the
de luxe subscription books can make either an
Illuminati or a Rosicrucian. No book published can
do that, nor can any course of lessons or instructions
which may be issued weekly or monthly for many
years and which ultimately cost the student many
times more than a legitimate scholarship would. This
Company has never made the claims attributed to it,
and the men who constantly cast innuendoes at this
Company in their publications, do so with the de-
liberate intent of distracting the attention of their
victims from their own numerous publications and
the fact that they are sailing under false colors, and
using the name of a Fraternity for which use they
have not one shred of authority.
