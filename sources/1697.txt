FOR POULSON'S AMERICAN DAILY ADVERTISEK.
Mr. Editor:—Five or six years ago, there was published in this city, a little work of
considerable ingenuity, said to have been written by Napoleon Buonaparte, entitled
" Innocent Amusement; or, The Hieroglyphical Fortune Teller." The authorship of the
book, its curiosity, and its merits are such as to make it interesting, and I would t^l under
peculiar obligation to any of your readers who conid inform me wliere a copy might be pro-
cured. Your Obed't Serv't,
R. J. M.
Eastern District ef Pennsylvania, to icit:
BE IT REMEMBERED, That on the eleventh day of December, in the forty-eighth
year of the Independence of the United States of Ame-iea, A. D. 1823, I. Irvine, of the said
tlistrict, hath deposited in this office the title of a book, the right whereof he claims as pro-
prietor, in the words followmg, to wit
:
" Innocent Amusement ; or, the Hieroglyphical Fortune-Teller. By an ingenious French-
raan."
In conformity to the act «!f the Congress of the United States, intituled, " An Act for the
Encourniiement of Learning, by securins the copies of Maps, Charts, and Books, to the au-
thor? and proprietors of such copies, durinsr the times therein mentioned"—And also to tne
act, entitled, " An Act supplementary to an\'\ct, entitled, ' An Act for the Encourasement ot
Jiearning, i)V securing the copies of Maps, Charts, and Books, to the authors and Pi'"P"^\"'!
of such copies during the times therein mentioned,' and extending the benehts thereol to tne
arts of designing, engraving, and etching historical and other prints."
D. CALDWELL,
Clerk of the Ea^stern District of Pennsylvaaaia.^
DIRECTIONS
FOR
THE USE OF THIS BOOK.
I.—Let the person whose fortune is to be told, select from the
card (or the book) a question and a hieroglyphic, designating each
hy its number.
For instance, suppose you lake the l6f/i Q;destlon—^'- Shall my icish be gratified?'"'
a,xd select the 9th Hieroglyphic.
II. —Let the person holding the bock find the number of the
question in the left hand column of the Directory, and the hiero-
glyphic at the top of it, and trace their respective stripes to their
iniersection. The letter found there is the index to the true aR=-
swer.
Thus tracing the 16th Question from the left of the Directory, and the 9th Hie-
roglyphic from the top of it, the stripes meet in X.
HI.—Turn to the page headed by the letter thus ascertained,
and the answer will be found opposite the hieroglyphic which was
selected.
Turning to page X, opposite to Hieroglyphic 9 you find the folloioing answer—-
" Your wish shall soon be gratified.''^
JVote. — denotes a considerable pause.
*He may be read he or she, according to the sex of the person
who asked the question.
H** in like manner may l^ft.i;ead him, or his, or her.
