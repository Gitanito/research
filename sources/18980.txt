afternoon Dr Greer
hello Pat how are you I&#39;m well how are
you doing good good well we&#39;re excited
to give everyone an update we&#39;ve got a
lot of questions yes that have been
coming in about the uh news story this
week
right
um earlier this week the department of
energy announced a Monumental milestone
in the nuclear fusion research a net
energy gain was achieved for the first
time in history by scientists from the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
in California so can you talk a little
bit about your thoughts when you heard
this in your thoughts now that you&#39;ve
had a chance to kind of look into this a
little more
well we have looked into it very
carefully and one of the things that uh
was not uh focused on is uh some really
key things about this the energy gain
that they achieved was the equivalent of
uh 0.1 uh kilowatt hour
so that&#39;s a tenth of a kilowatt for an
hour which is enough to boil a kettle of
water
um they&#39;ve spent three and a half
billion dollars of our taxpayer money uh
from the Department of energy at
Lawrence Livermore there have been five
billion dollars spent on private Fusion
initiatives
this particular reaction the one silver
lining in it is that scientifically they
are claiming they got more energy out
than in so they were admitting and what
is called an over Unity result over
Unity meaning you put in uh one unit of
power and you get out two or what have
you but in this case the amount of gain
was very very small
it took a couple of hundred high-powered
high-energy lasers
aimed at a pellet of tritium and nutrium
which her uh radioactive isotopes to
smash them together
and when you see the headline that they
got more energy out than in cause a
fusion which is when uh you know two
atoms fuse together like in the Sun or a
hydrogen bomb
what they&#39;re leaving out is the enormous
amount of energy it took to run these
nearly 200 lasers
so it&#39;s a little bit it&#39;s it&#39;s a very
deceptive actually and I would go close
to calling this fraudulent because it&#39;s
like you plug in your electric car
to a coal-fired grid and saying you&#39;re
driving on free electricity because once
you get the car running
it&#39;s not using any uh electricity from
the grid anymore but of course it runs
down and each time you have to then put
in uh plug it in again and it&#39;s pulling
energy out of a coal-fired gas-fired
oil-fired grid for 88 of the energy that
we use in our electric grid so it&#39;s a
very interesting announcement
now I guess from a a theoretical point
of view uh they achieved a fusion event
um which they have been searching for
for a long time
but to claim that this is some kind of
solution for a carbon free energy future
brings up a whole lot of issues number
one
you can&#39;t discount to zero the amount of
energy it takes to run the machine
so in this case if you factor in the
amount of energy it took to get those
two atoms to fuse together it was
nowhere near over Unity it was nowhere
near a net energy gain it was a enormous
1200 times 1200 times energy loss so it
took 1 200 times more energy
from the lasers to create the ignition
they call it and the fusion where they
got this tiny gain now and I&#39;m not sure
in what Universe they think that you
would achieve that reaction without
having to put energy into the system
uh I guess one could theoretically claim
that once you got it going it could
become a chain reaction
the problem with that is the
temperatures involved were 3 million
degrees in some of the private Fusion
experiments they&#39;ve been 300 million
degrees this brings up a big issue of
safety and who wants something that is
that hot operating somewhere because if
it were to have a breach that amount of
temperature would ignite the oxygen in
the air
so you&#39;re getting into all kinds of
technical issues Beyond just the
theoretical physics of yes we achieved
Fusion but I want to remind people
hydrogen bomb is a fusion reaction now
what do I mean
hydrogen bombs as opposed to atomic
bombs or or hydrogen bombs are also
called thermonuclear bombs they usually
use a small atomic bomb
uh to Force Fusion
uh and and petrodium is also used in
hydrogen bombs nuclear warheads and that
then causes Fusion that causes this
explosive energy release known as a
nuclear weapon
now in this case they&#39;re doing it on
such a small scale that they&#39;re not
having an explosion the question is you
know causing that to be a routine source
of energy
is a uh or certainly facts that are not
in evidence from a science point of view
the other question is the supply of
tritium
they&#39;re not much of it around and it
costs as I mentioned uh 850
000 account
30 000 a gram and there&#39;s about 28
Grands in an ounce
all right so excuse me not a pound so
it&#39;s eight hundred and fifty thousand
dollars for an
ounce of the stuff
so a pound of it we&#39;re talking millions
and millions so if you were to have
these reactors all over the place
generate enough electricity assuming you
get into a true over Unity reaction that
continues
where is that coming from how are you
going to do that where you can create
Tried Him by bombarding lithium
with uh neutrons and but that&#39;s a very
expensive process it&#39;s why it costs
thirty thousand dollars a gram
so when you&#39;re looking at an ounce of
the stuff causing costing nearly a
million bucks and you&#39;re looking at
eight billion people and you&#39;re looking
at the technical challenges and the
temperatures involved in this all of
this
win for a hundred years there have been
low temperature plasma reactions I&#39;ve
seen them
uh and also electromagnetic systems like
Tesla had
that are pulling energy out of the
quantum vacuum
or Zero Point Energy field resulting in
a real
over Unity effect where you&#39;re getting
much more power out than in you know the
Floyd sweet device for example that
we&#39;re featuring in the Lost Century by
the way we really need everyone to go to
the rossenturyfilm.com
and uh contribute to that we&#39;re about uh
57 to our goal I think in the next six
weeks or so we&#39;ll have the movie
finished and then by we hope May late
April or May we&#39;re going to have it
released
this movie is going to set the record
straight on all of this uh and our goal
is that it is seen by at least a billion
people or so the reason for it is that
these sorts of announcements are suspect
for their timing and their purpose
uh and let me get into this a little bit
um we there&#39;s a history of
when the truth begins to emerge on an
issue
there are very powerful interests that
want to Pivot towards an announcement
that the whole media covers and the
globally in the scientific community
that basically is gaslighting or
distracting diverting uh people uh and
it&#39;s a little bit strange that this
announcement comes after we presented
what we did in Santa Monica in October
and the plans that we have the release
the information about these genuine
earth-saving Technologies uh which are
behind by the way how uaps and UFOs
operate uh they&#39;re they know they don&#39;t
have nuclear power plants on them and
they&#39;re not burning jet fuel a or or
solid Rockets because there&#39;s no heat
signature to them and this has been
confirmed by the Pentagon officially
so we&#39;re saying uh what I&#39;m saying here
is that there there&#39;s something that is
rather suspect about the timing of this
announcement and the lock step coverage
without much I mean the guardian and a
few papers in Europe have questioned the
legitimacy of this because they pointed
out that the power needed to run those
nearly 200 lasers was not in the uh
equation for it being
a net gain of power which is of course
ridiculous because the the reaction
didn&#39;t happen by itself it cannot happen
by itself
so then you get into this whole
discussion of why would you know as the
National Security Agency people have
told me they set up things called DDT
operations
and yes it was a a poisonous uh uh
insecticide but the
purpose of a DDT and the intelligence
Community it stands for you set up a
decoy you distract everyone&#39;s attention
and then you trash everyone&#39;s efforts to
run down a rabbit hole and go into the
weeds over here it&#39;s a diversion you
just keep diverting people but you see
we saw this happened
before when the unacknowledged the
documentary that hit 760 million views
around the world
um
within a few months of that coming out
they stood up the ttsa
and they stood up Elizondo and Chris
Mill and other people that were had all
the doors open to them in the mainstream
media everything from 60 Minutes on CBS
to CNN everywhere else saying gee you
know we don&#39;t know what these are maybe
they&#39;re from China
all right so that was a complete
misdirect that the UFO Community the
public members of Congress uh people uh
in the media they took that they hooked
Line and Sinker so my question here is
is that&#39;s what&#39;s going on here but
preemptively
because uh we&#39;re working with a number
of people whether or not it makes it
into this documentary film or not is
unclear that uh apparently have systems
that that are operational but they don&#39;t
quite know how to kind of get it out
there because they&#39;re afraid of
repercussions or people have been known
to disappear uh or have problems when
they begin to publicly acknowledge they
have such a system
but which is what we&#39;re doing this
documentary The Lost Century for and
this is why everyone listening you know
if a few hundred thousand people who
will see this if everyone went on there
and just gave five dollars at the Lost
centuryfilm.com we&#39;d have enough to
finish the film and also get a huge
amount of information and publicity out
about it when it comes out this spring
so we need your help but I think that
the other issue I have with this Pat is
when they announced this
uh there was not enough people asking
the hard questions that are in the fine
print
of the information that anyone Google
what I just said about tritium what it
costs how rare it is look into the
question of whether this over Unity more
power net gain than it took
is true when they left out and I have
not found yet how many how much energy
and power it was needed to run these
nearly 200
high-powered high energy lasers uh to
ignite this reaction with with the uh
with trinium
and a trident by the way is H3 is
healing it&#39;s hydrogen is uh it&#39;s an
isotope of hydrogen basically it&#39;s
called tritium has three hydrogen it&#39;s
an isotope so that is something which
you begin to question
if this is a legitimate scientific
breakthrough
there should be an asterisk there
because it&#39;s been known for decades
since we first achieved fusion with for
hydrogen bombs that you could get
a lot of energy out more than you would
have to put in that&#39;s why they&#39;re so
destructive I mean this is why this is
news to anyone for example most people
don&#39;t know what a thermonuclear weapon
is and so they can Gaslight the public
and the media not many journalists are
or versed in physics and and whatnot so
I want to be very clear about this uh
this is not the first time there&#39;s been
a hydrogen fusion reaction tritium has
been used in nuclear warheads I mean
that&#39;s how you do a hydrogen bomb as
opposed to an atomic bomb now just to be
clear an atomic bomb what we dropped on
Hiroshima and nakasaki that was a
fission bomb where you split the atom
and when you split the atom you get all
this energy this is Fusion where you
combine and Collide uh atoms and they
fuse together which releases even more
power that&#39;s why a hydrogen bomb or
thermonuclear bomb is so much more
destructive than an atomic bomb
but that is something that was known
science since the late 40s early 50s
right
so in the early 50s we detonated the
first High hydrogen bomb which was a
fusion hydrogen bomb now this obviously
is not a bomb thank God they couldn&#39;t do
that in a populated area Lawrence
Livermore Labs there in the Bay Area of
San Francisco uh across the bay but
uh it&#39;s not as if Fusion had been done
before and in this case yes they had a
minor amount of Excess power but there&#39;s
no indication that that can be
replicated free of the amount of power
it would take to start the ignition
and that that would actually then carry
on to something that would be
commercially available for example
as we have pointed out and we&#39;re
pointing this out in this documentary
The Lost century
there&#39;s three billion people who have no
means of electricity or gas to cook
their food that&#39;s why they&#39;re cutting
down all the brush and rainforests and
all over the world in these impoverished
areas so you know that&#39;s pushing half
the world&#39;s population almost uh 40 or
so so then the question becomes how are
you going to get something this complex
and potentially dangerous deployed all
over the world to really fix The
Disappearance of of the the rainforest
and to fix the whole climate issue and
the global poverty issue now our tax
dollars have been dumped to the tune of
three and a half billion dollars into
this private investment has gone 5
billion into private Fusion initiatives
and to give you an idea
I&#39;m quite sure that if there was 100
million
so you know this is like a hundred
billion dollar project uh you know in
where there should be a 100 million
dollar solution where you would
basically bring in the scientists who
understand the zero point Quantum vacuum
flux with these electromagnetic systems
and also plasma systems low temperature
plasmas a few thousand degrees not
Millions
uh I was witness to one of these in
Florida that uh Professor centilli had I
was also made aware of one in Salt Lake
City that unfortunately was involved
with a group who did not want to have it
disclosed but it was a plasma reactor
that was filled a closet area that had
enough output to run all of the
metropolitan area of Salt Lake City
no radiation
over Unity self-sustaining
Etc
so given the fact that there is evidence
and proofs that these systems have
existed
all right why don&#39;t we have our
government and also private investors
give that area of research a chance
rather than dumping tens of billions and
you know I know what&#39;s going on in China
with the big International Fusion
reactor that has already consumed 22
billion dollars B billion so this is
something that&#39;s both from a policy
point of view and a scientific point of
view is very worrisome when a
infinitesimal fraction of what&#39;s being
spent on this Fusion reactor research
would give us a solution that would run
everyone&#39;s house and car but here&#39;s the
big rub
those solutions would preclude the giant
industrial behemoths by General Electric
and other big outfits of controlling the
central power grid this is a solution if
it were to ever work that would Empower
massive multi-billion dollar facilities
that is centralized with an electric
distribution grid the power lines
Transmissions that maintains the status
quo
of the economic Global power of those
who already have it and this is a
problem because a huge swaths of Asia
India Africa Latin America don&#39;t have
power lines to Villages and poor areas
and it&#39;s trillions of dollars to build
those power lines never mind if the
power plant this Fusion reactor would
even work when there&#39;s a solution where
you wouldn&#39;t need any power lines
because your house and your car would
have one of these systems pulling energy
out of the Zero Point Energy field but
see that&#39;s why no one wants to support
that
because the big money knows that and the
big government knows that in fact if you
were to support that you&#39;re going to
cause a complete winding down of the
centralized power
macro economic power it&#39;s called
globally that is running the earth into
the ground and is ensuring half the
world&#39;s population is in poverty
so I think that this is something that
has to be called out for what it is it&#39;s
very suspect the timing of it is suspect
and I&#39;m I think that instead of trying
to play catch-up
uh from behind like they did when
unacknowledged came out
they&#39;re trying to get ahead of the curve
with this
and try to say to the public oh gee you
know now you don&#39;t need to worry there&#39;s
a real issue here it&#39;s psychologically
because people see that headline they go
oh great
the global climate change and poverty
issue is solved there&#39;s no indication at
all that this is a is a solution for
that
um but it would entice people sort of
like the electric car Zeitgeist and
solar and wind power kind of Walled
people until very recently into thinking
oh well now there&#39;s a solution we don&#39;t
need to to think of anything else
right and and so it&#39;s sort of like the
Wizard of Oz
uh pulling all the levers create this
big distraction
that you know keeps everyone focused
over here when if you pull the curtain
back you see that it&#39;s a very clever
manipulation and deception now some
people say well that&#39;s rather cynical I
know it&#39;s how power and cartels and
people operate uh you know this kind of
of deceptive uh indication and warning
there&#39;s that&#39;s the name of these sort of
operations at the Pentagon so I think
that we have to be skeptical
it&#39;s fine to be hopeful and the one good
thing about it they do admit that they
got more energy out that end if you
discount the lasers but and we can say
okay so if you&#39;re admitting that&#39;s the
case why don&#39;t we do that with an
electromagnetic system that doesn&#39;t have
to be 3 million degrees
and why don&#39;t we do it with something
that doesn&#39;t require trinium
that costs 850 000 an ounce
uh so I think that you know it&#39;s
something that we have to skillfully
explain to the public and this we are
going to add a little bit of this in the
Lost Century but you know that&#39;s
rewinding that production down but it
ain&#39;t over yet I&#39;m hoping it&#39;ll be
completely finished by the end of
January so it can be handed off the
distribution which takes two or three
months to prepare but I think that we
can include this issue and at the points
that I&#39;m making here but I think the the
other issue in my mind is to what extent
has this been designed to placate the
public to make them you know sit back on
their Laurels because until very
recently that&#39;s what people were doing
with solar and wind and look I&#39;m a big
advocate of anything besides something
that you know pollutes the air because I
have a gigantic solar farm at my country
house it&#39;s the largest legally allowed
solar farm in Virginia
however it won&#39;t run my house when the
power goes out it won&#39;t even heat it or
cool even though it&#39;s the largest one
Allowed by law
so you know I&#39;m willing to acknowledge
it&#39;s better than nothing and it&#39;s
certainly better than burning wood or
coal or oil or gas
or a nuclear reactor that creates a
million years worth of you know
cancer-causing radioactive debris
but
you know we can do better than that but
I think that it&#39;s there&#39;s a slippery
slope here where people think well now
that that has been solved we don&#39;t need
to search for or fund
so it sucks all the oxygen out of the
room for alternative solutions that
would be more practical and affordable
and effective that would actually work
in time to actually save the biosphere
and uh get us off this extinction level
event path that that the humanity is on
right now so I think all of these are
big issues you have to ask the question
uh because most people only read the
headlines Pat you know what I found is
that here&#39;s the headline I don&#39;t know
how many people who see the headlines
drill down on the physics and the
technical reality of what&#39;s behind that
headline and this is why I&#39;m doing this
YouTube
uh expose of it because anyone who wants
to check the facts that I&#39;ve just shared
can check them and they&#39;re there for
anyone to check who&#39;s a scientist or
anyone in the lay public who can
understand this kind of technical
information but I think the analysis
that I want to bring to this is a much
more specific one and that is
When I See This sort of event happen I
wonder if in fact there are some agendas
unspoken
as to why the timing of it and what
they&#39;re trying to do with this because
uh recently major a classically liberal
journals like The Economist and
scientific journals have been pointed
out that has been made very evident with
the Ukraine war and the Russia gas being
cut off to Europe that the most green
countries in the world have no way of
running their homes and factories and
businesses with wind and solar even if
they put trillions of dollars and to
invest because there&#39;s not enough energy
density there&#39;s not enough some battery
storage capacity I think there&#39;s
something like globally
75 seconds of energy storage capacity
and batteries uh to run the needs of the
planet 75 seconds for the needs that
we&#39;re actually consuming so the
Lithium-ion batteries that are used for
that don&#39;t have enough storage capacity
and of course the sun doesn&#39;t shine 25
four hours a day and the wind doesn&#39;t
blow 24 hours a day so you get into this
real issue how do you really move to a
post-carbon post grimy
you know coal gas oil nuclear power the
economy all this dirty destructive
energy source uh I don&#39;t think it&#39;s
going to be a fusion reactor it&#39;s going
to be these technologies that no one is
looking at and the more there&#39;s a
tension grabbing headline like this the
more it&#39;s going to pull people&#39;s
attention away from what we&#39;re trying to
expose and advocate for over to a
non-solution solution and that I think
is exactly what I would think if I was
in the other position
if I was on the other side of this
trying to figure out how do we basically
pull attention away from what the
disclosure project is doing and what
we&#39;re doing with these new energy uh
Revelations about zero point what have
you how do we capture the media
attention and the public attention the
government&#39;s attention the department of
energy the department of energy
secretary who made this announcement
Grant home how do we get them to to just
ignore all this
because we&#39;ve got quote serious
scientists who have proven that we have
a hydrogen economy and and uh free
energy non-polluting with carbon I think
it&#39;s actually very highly manipulative
yeah and
they&#39;ve targeted that&#39;s their Market
that they&#39;ve targeted right the Congress
private investors institutions and the
public and the media the media and the
public so this is typical they&#39;ve done
the same thing with the UFO secrecy for
70 80 years
um I think that it&#39;s predictable uh I
would love it if an actual solution was
revealed
um and supported but when you drill down
on this one my concern is and many
physicists by the way I&#39;m not the only
person saying this a lot of top
physicists are saying exactly what I&#39;m
saying uh that it may or may not be
first of all a reproducible experiment
no one&#39;s reproduced it yet
and of course if you don&#39;t reproduce it
so why and then the other is that there
are scientists pointing out rather
pointedly that the amount of energy it
took to start that what they call
ignition this over Unity reaction Fusion
was 1 200 times more than they got out
well that&#39;s a big hill decline I mean
you can go to Ace Hardware and get a 90
electric generator
you know or any you know Home Depot or
Lowe&#39;s or whatever so you know you&#39;re
getting into this question of uh when
you you have to you know put in
1200 times
more energy to get enough energy out to
boil a a tea kettle of water
you have to go well you know this is
worrisome because is this a deliberate
Omission or how are they whistling past
that graveyard uh they&#39;re not presenting
any solutions that would indicate that
they can get around that start that
energy needed to get the reaction going
this is why you know you have a little
atomic bomb very powerful that ignites
the fusion and a hydrogen bomb it takes
an enormous amount of energy to make
that happen
you know a star like the sun is a fusion
reactor but it&#39;s massive amounts of
gravitational energy
that then squeeze and force the the the
the atoms together that causes the
amount of energy needed to ignite a
fusion and then start something like a
star so these are all known facts in
science you can look these things up
and I think that from a policy and
strategic point of view which is where
I&#39;m where I&#39;m always looking at this is
what is this really going to lead to is
it going to really lead to a solution or
is it going to suck up all the money and
energy and attention uh and make people
feel they can sit back on their Laurels
that oh we have a solution now because
I&#39;m hearing from people who are very big
supporters of the disclosure project are
saying oh well maybe this is a great
breakthrough now we have an energy
solution because they didn&#39;t drill down
on
the data and the science behind the
headlines
and that&#39;s why I think why I needed to
urgently do this uh YouTube analysis now
I hope it could be that someone figures
out a way to pull this out of a 3
million or 300 million dollar reaction
to to stumble across a plasma
that is a few thousand degrees that can
perpetually be running like the one that
was up in Salt Lake City that they were
keeping secret it was Kept Secret after
a four-star general got on the board of
the organization and went South from
there not to be heard from again but I
think that is something that if if it
led to that that&#39;d be great but I think
that&#39;s what we need to sort of steer
people towards and I think the Lost
century
uh film that we&#39;re doing may be able to
have to be able to turn that into a more
productive immediate solution not
something that&#39;s many many decades down
the road that may never work so I think
we have to find a way to make lemonade
out of the lemon here because this
announcement is a bit of a lemon and I
had find it very suspicious
I can&#39;t imagine what kind of facility
what kind of Mega facility this would be
to house 200 lasers that use I think in
the guardian one scientist said that was
500 megajoules going in there which is
like 138 kilowatt hours I mean I just
can&#39;t imagine it how big that and how
many would you have to have even I mean
really to cover what part of the globe
well yeah and they got enough energy out
to to to to to to
boil a tea kettle now in contrast there
are physicists who have pointed out that
the Zero Point Energy field the amount
of energy in the volume of space in a
coffee mug your coffee mug oh go look at
one the amount of space inside that mug
has enough Laden energy to boil off all
the Waters of the world
if it was accessed now of course
physicists will say well there&#39;s no way
to access it well that&#39;s not true it&#39;s
just been covered up
and and suppressed people have accessed
it but those devices always meet a early
demise because there are corrupt
interests that suppress them which is
the dynamic we&#39;re trying to change so I
think that this is this whole discussion
here uh everyone listening to this needs
to share this the YouTube link with
everyone they know and then share the
link to the lost centuryfilm.com because
we need to actually do something to save
humanity and the biosphere that&#39;s
practical and isn&#39;t some sort of
gaslighting of the public and the
politicians and the scientific community
and the media into this into the weeds
of this thing uh by the way you can you
can look up the size of this monstrosity
at Lawrence Livermore labs and uh also
the big International
uh Fusion reactor they&#39;re building uh in
China that they&#39;ve already spent 22
billion dollars on a lot of that has
been U.S taxpayer money by the way
um and they still don&#39;t have anything
results from that reactor after dropping
22 billion dollars into it I would
challenge people give me less than one
percent of that in an Institute that
we&#39;re we want to form and we would have
a breakthrough that for every home and
car and business in the world and every
village in Africa and India would be a
real solution but you see it seems like
the things that are real solutions never
get the support uh because and make note
here
tens of billions of dollars have gone
into this hydrogen Fusion research from
government and private I mentioned 5
billion private dollars have gone in why
don&#39;t those same people just throw some
tiny fraction
of that in the direction of new Energy
Research that&#39;s electromagnetic
Quantum vacuum flux zero point uh
hydrogen from the water you know like
Stan Myers system or water Gene can
system why don&#39;t why don&#39;t why doesn&#39;t
that happen and it would take nowhere
near the 10 civilians that have gone in
to these other uh boondoggles in physics
I one of the things I thought of when I
read the article uh and how much
personnel and years of research uh
decades and money it reminds me of a
friend of the disclosure project that I
worked with back in the 90s who was a
NASA research scientist Dr Richard
Haynes he says oh yes he says we
consider ourselves White Collar welfare
so I wore my white shirt
uh white-collar welfare basically it&#39;s
these make work products you know look
at you know look busy and do this and
that and you know they make these great
salaries and pensions and everything but
that&#39;s what Dr Haynes called what he and
his colleagues were doing White Collar
welfare
my thought it was hilarious uh when he
used that expression I had never heard
it but this this reminds me a little bit
of that it&#39;s sort of like uh a huge make
work project that the people who are
supporting it know it&#39;s never going to
go anywhere a lot of them know I think
some of them don&#39;t a lot of them are
very hopeful
um but they&#39;re not educated what we need
to do is be sure they get educated on
these other alternatives that are much
more practical for which there&#39;s a great
deal of body of evidence a huge body of
evidence that they&#39;ve existed in the
past
um and that a a small amount of support
I mean we&#39;re not asking for you know 22
billion like the Chinese Fusion reactor
or the three and a half billion dollars
that went into this Lawrence Livermore
project
uh and and give us a chance let&#39;s give
the the inventors and the research
Community dealing with uh these
electromagnetic field uh
Energy Systems and and low temperature
of 3000 degree or so plasma systems of
several of which I&#39;ve known about a
chance and do it in an open source
scientific way
so that the whole world sees what&#39;s
happening transparently the results are
dispersed transparently people can
reproduce them I predict in a couple of
years not in 20 or 30 we&#39;d have massive
breakthroughs and the world&#39;s uh
Fortunes in terms of the future of the
of humanity and the Earth being healed
of the damage we&#39;ve done to it would
would be a totally different story than
the very long trajectory if it works at
all for this Fusion reactor business
they talked about the um they were
talking about the scientists that are
working with the goal of a multinational
multi-billion dollar project called the
international
thermonuclear experimental reactor or
iter which is under construction in
southern France now and
um there&#39;s one in France there&#39;s one in
China they&#39;re they&#39;re doing this all
over but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s you know
tens of billions of dollars
yeah I think a doe just said that they
in September they had made an investment
of 50 million dollars
for public-private partnership for the
fusion pilot plant designs that&#39;s for
the plant designs and I I doubt that&#39;s
for the building of it
yeah exactly well see with that amount
we would be able to have a open source
lab open source meaning everything being
transmitted to the public any
breakthroughs given freely to the
scientific community and Engineers
around the world to prove or disprove
you know one of the things that I keep
saying that any of you inventors out
there working on these systems
uh I&#39;m going to a meeting next week with
some people who have these systems I
can&#39;t say where or who because they want
to be very hush hush at this stage
but
you don&#39;t
try to make a product to sell
before
you&#39;ve done the scientific work and had
it disclosed in a way that people who
are quote skilled in the art of
electrical engineering or whatever can
prove it because when you&#39;re talking
about the one thing I always agree with
Carl Sagan on extraordinary claims
require extraordinary evidence you
cannot no one&#39;s going to take the word
of an inventor and the little business
you know that they have around them that
this works it has to be proven it has to
be tested independently it has to be at
least a version of it has to be open
sourced so that any skeptical
not the bunker but a skeptical scientist
can go let me test this let us build
this up from the plans that these guys
have
and let us test it and see if in fact
it&#39;s putting out more energy than it has
to go into it and and let us check the
facts on this because if you don&#39;t do
that
the public the politicians the media and
most importantly the scientific
Community isn&#39;t going to believe it
because while there are corrupt
scientists and there are corrupt
politicians most of them are not there&#39;s
not like there&#39;s some vast conspiracy
where everyone is in on this but they
need to see something more than the
assertions and claims of the
stakeholders the investors and the
inventor and this is something I&#39;ve
never yet been able to convince uh an
inventor or scientific team to do they
all treat it as if we got to keep this
so secret no one knows how it works and
we&#39;re going to just suddenly go from
that to selling a product I&#39;m going no
you cannot you got to do this scientific
process and disclose it just
transparently honestly and let people
test it but that not only verifies it
which is very important when you&#39;re
dealing with a radical claim like this
an over Unity more energy out than in
claim
uh which is many people say not possible
due to the laws of their mind Dynamics
which is a false statement because what
they&#39;re not factoring in is the amount
of latent energy in the zero point
Quantum vacuum which as I said the
volume of space in the coffee mug you
have over there would but is enough
energy to boil off all the uh oceans of
the planet never mind you&#39;ll keep a tea
kettle so I think that this is why we&#39;re
advocating a a process where we get one
system that actually is over Unity
closed loop meaning the output runs the
input and it&#39;s there running putting out
energy because it continuously is
tapping into this latent field of energy
that is all around us what Tesla calls
the infinite energy field
um and I think that if that were to
happen it doesn&#39;t preclude later that
same group or scientist or group of
investors to then create a product that
could be sold at your local hardware
store or online it just means that it
would establish it as a bona fide area
of science it would prove it but most
importantly
it would disclose it to the masses what
I would want to do if I got one of these
today tonight I would contact everyone I
know who has a million or more or 100
million followers on social media and
get them to send out to their followers
the plans the information and then the
first 20 of them we build I would have
it running their house and cars because
if even if the corrupt media gets a
phone call from the CIA saying do not
cover this
if you have a couple of billion people
through a lot of these celebrities and
influencers dropping links to it then
you know the cat&#39;s out of the bag and
that&#39;s our strategy it&#39;s a very
important thing that people understand
it&#39;s a strategy that would go make a
workaround uh the the Embargo on
information that the media and
government and suppression has been able
to do and we&#39;ve studied uh now for
almost 30 years how they&#39;ve done it why
they&#39;ve done it and what the mechanisms
are and that knowledge which will
present in in the Lost Century uh film
uh informs this strategy I&#39;m describing
now so this would be my other challenge
to those listening if you&#39;re concerned
about the environment and energy and
poverty
you should help us organize people who
can fund This research and development
lab to do exactly that and to take this
to the next level where it would be
really done transparently and
scientifically because you know as a
doctor if someone were to come to me and
say I have a new treatment for
leukemia
and but it&#39;s a secret
nobody can know what it is nobody can
know how it works but but here it&#39;s you
know fifty thousand dollars a dose will
you give it to your patient I said no
you know and and so this is you know
people who are these inventors and
engineers and these sort of small
investment groups that build up around
them
they need to kind of learn a little bit
that this isn&#39;t how you make a new
industry and a new area of science or a
new breakthrough in science because
that&#39;s just as ludicrous no one&#39;s going
to take the word of The Advocate who
stands to profit millions or billions of
dollars and just say yeah I&#39;m going to
take your word for it
um it&#39;s no scientific breakthrough has
ever Advanced that way
it has to be released to people in a way
that people can verify it recreate it
reproduce it and say yeah this is real
and I I speak of this because I know in
Academia the opposite sometimes happens
I have a family member who shall remain
unnamed who is in a very top drawer PhD
program
and the principal investigator under
which this person was doing their PHD
was found to have falsified
all the data that resulted in this
person being a tenured professor at one
of the most prestigious universities in
the world
and uh this family member who kind of
blew the whistle on it and almost cost
that person their entire career
but this happens in Academia too where
you know people don&#39;t check the facts
and don&#39;t check the uh reality it
happens in medicine it happens in
physics it happens there&#39;s junk science
all over the place so because of that
the people are right to be skeptical now
they need to be skeptical of the claims
about this Fusion reactor and look into
the facts I have just shared but anyone
who claims they have a quote free energy
device or an over-unity energy device
it&#39;s electromagnetic or plasma or water
they need to be able to say
here here is a it may not be the thing
with the state of the art of what they
have but it needs to be a proof of
principle system that can be tested
verified published put out to the public
now because this is an area of science
that I don&#39;t think any mainstream
physics journal will touch
uh because those were also tend to be
very high bound and skeptical it just
needs to be put out publicly in a large
enough way that enough Engineers
scientists and academic institutions
begin to go oh well let us try this and
they put it together in Wildlife it
works
you&#39;re not going to be able to silence
thousands of people who have reproduced
that effect you can&#39;t
because it&#39;s either going to work or it
doesn&#39;t so I I strongly recommend that
anyone listening to this YouTube who
knows someone or themselves may have
what a system think about what I&#39;m
sharing and get in touch with us through
our website
seriousdisclosure.com
s-i-r-i-u-s-disclosure.com all one word
and there&#39;s a box there to contact me
and you know a contact box and and let
us know what you have and we can discuss
this I think there&#39;s a way of doing it
we&#39;re in this first phase
you open source it you put it out you
educate the public
um and then in the second phase that
doesn&#39;t preclude that group moving with
something maybe they have in the back
room that may be more developed if
they&#39;re wanting to be paranoid and be
concerned about money uh my concern is
not money my concern is the future of
the planet and and strategy and science
but I understand people who put millions
of dollars into their research don&#39;t
want to lose all that either so I think
that there&#39;s a way to do it that we need
to find a way that satisfies those needs
but ultimately it&#39;s not going to go
anywhere a if it&#39;s not scientifically
verified and B if it&#39;s not disclosed to
hundreds of millions or a billion or two
people because some a breakthrough this
big is so disruptive to the status quo
of the big money the big monkeys with
their big money piles and how they
control the global economy any entity
that tries to do this and with any other
strategy is going to be smashed and
smushed like a wormy Apple they are
going to go nowhere with it and the
reason I can say that emphatically is
that if you do a study of the last
hundred years that is what has happened
to every single one of these systems
because none of them have done the
scientific
transparent open source scientific
release of some iteration or version of
what they have so that it could have
gone viral and become newsworthy and
gotten to a lot of people now before the
last few years
and before the internet there was no way
to get the news of something like this
to a billion people now there is because
there are so many people interested in
the environment poverty climate change
energy uh if you were to release
something like this and you had some
prime movers who are celebrities and
people with enormous social media
following much bigger than mine for
example
um then you&#39;re going to be able to put
something out there that will be uh
really have momentum and won&#39;t be
stoppable and won&#39;t be able to be
suppressed it can&#39;t be suppressed one of
the things I always point out to these
scientists
you&#39;ve by keeping it secret in a small
group you&#39;ve painted a big bullseye on
your back because you&#39;re the sole
holders of that knowledge and if you do
that you&#39;re making your security if
you&#39;re going to look at it set up
security Ops operations and protocols
you have done the worst fatal mistake
possible to make your group and yourself
vulnerable to these attacks so it
doesn&#39;t make sense strategically at all
to behave that way it&#39;s so
counterproductive but it&#39;s also
counter-intuitive from what most small
businesses and Venture Capital groups
and Technology groups do they are
trained to keep things very secret they
don&#39;t want competitors to know they
behave as if they&#39;re dealing with a
better software program or a better uh
computer circuit or something but
they&#39;re not they&#39;re dealing with
something that is so disruptive to to
the status quo of the power players on
the planet that they have no idea that
the buzz saw that they&#39;re going to step
into is going to chew them up and
there&#39;s a way around it but it&#39;s a very
specific pathway and that&#39;s what we&#39;re
trying to advocate
right
quite a heavy lift there it can be done
I you know I&#39;m convinced it can be done
I I think it&#39;s actually not difficult
often the real uh genius on a plan is
it&#39;s utter Simplicity and unexpected
it&#39;s an unexpected way that you no one
would think you would do this uh but if
you keep doing the same thing over and
over again making all the mistakes have
been made from the 20s till now over 100
years you you&#39;re you&#39;re you are nuts
insane if you think you&#39;re going to get
a different result you&#39;re not going to
get a different result so I would plead
with anyone listening who may have one
of these systems or know someone who
does to think about this and think that
you can do
very well by doing good and there&#39;s a
pathway but you need to understand the
Strategic uh
world that you&#39;re in if you you&#39;ve got a
tiger by the tail if you&#39;ve got
something that&#39;s legitimately over unity
and not some you know
100 billion dollar boondoggle like this
Fusion reactor business
um because it is so disruptive uh now it
has to be disruptive we don&#39;t have a
hundred years to dither away like the
last 100 years the earth and and the
population of the Earth more importantly
uh long before I think we would run out
of fossil fuels we&#39;re going to run out
of of the Earth being able to tolerate
this level of abuse but also the the
disparity between the wealthy rich
countries and the poor I mean that&#39;s a
that&#39;s a time bomb ready to explode when
you have three billion people who are
scrounging around for wood to make
charcoal to cook their food and they
don&#39;t even have gas or electricity at
all and we&#39;re talking about these Fusion
reactors I mean it&#39;s there&#39;s a major
disconnect
that isn&#39;t compassionate I mean you know
think of the poor people I mean imagine
we were lucky we were born how we were
born but what if you were born in one of
these impoverished areas
and your your prospects are nil
and and announcing that there&#39;s a you
know trillion dollar Fusion reactor that
maybe you could get hooked into at some
point it&#39;s almost a cruel joke to half
the world&#39;s population actually
so I look at this from many perspectives
technical scientific strategic
humanitarian and uh you might plea to
people is you know why don&#39;t we give
this approach a chance so all the other
approaches have been tried and failed
you know you know Stan Meyer keeping his
secret and then falsifying the patent so
no one could recreate it so no one could
steal it from him and then he was he&#39;s
dead I mean I&#39;ve seen this story play
out so many times even in my career over
the last 30 years
um that you know at a certain point you
go gee you know how many times do you
have to keep banging your head against
that wall before you get half a clue
that that ain&#39;t gonna work isn&#39;t going
to work
uh I think one of the problems is
there&#39;s no institutional memory and by
that I mean everyone who comes across
this they don&#39;t know the history of
what&#39;s going on before them
and since they don&#39;t know that they end
up making the same mistakes that&#39;s
another thing that I hope that the Lost
Century film can remedy because people
who see it
who are working on these Solutions or
may have one in their business or garage
or what have you will go ah this is what
I was planning to do
and they will see the predictable things
that others have done that have failed
and why they failed
it&#39;s very it&#39;s a logical analysis and
I&#39;m hoping that it&#39;ll have that effect
even for the inventor community and the
engineering community that are pursuing
these Solutions
that would be
so there&#39;s a lot of good a great deal of
good that can come from the Lost century
so I hope you guys will all support that
by going to thelawcentryfilm.com and and
their incentive gifts you know if
they&#39;re about a dozen different
incentive gifts for different levels of
giving
and um you know it&#39;ll be put to
extremely good use none of it goes to me
per se it goes to the production into
the getting the word out marketing of it
and hopefully at that point
but you know if we can reach numbers
beyond what unacknowledged and Close
Encounters of the fifth kind reached uh
it will have a huge effect in
potentiating and giving power to this
direction these Solutions
that&#39;s our goal rather than make a
centralized ones right yes exactly yeah
well thank you Dr Greer thank you and
thank everyone uh who&#39;s who&#39;s listening
for supporting what we&#39;re doing and uh
we&#39;ll keep you informed as this uh
develops further yeah yes and thank you
for explaining this I know this is
something that most of us really do not
understand because most of us are not
physicists or scientists so thank you so
much for this we appreciate you&#39;re
welcome and have a happy holiday
everybody
all right bye-bye
