BY PROF. WILLIAM ESTEP v
INTRODUCTION
In presenting this unusual work to the
student, the writer desires to impress them
with the absolute necessity of* keeping these
things written herein a secret, since it is
the former secret teaching of the Orient, and
the Science w i l l serve well only those who do
not expose its methods, since profane minds
are not ready to pass judgment on the ancient
mysteries of mind, body, and soul.
The writer v is ite d India where he met
the greatest fa k irs , and magis and was r e ­
ceived into th eir Orders a fte r being in v e s ti­
gated as to his fitness to become a teacher
of this wonderful work. He had years o f
study in mind science before these profound
mysteries were revealed to him. Memorize
your charts, and don’ t even expose one to
view i f you would beccme a magi. This s c i -

to earth’ s chosen few who w i l l sa c rific e to ob­

Aura of the earth.
Now these colors , being disturbed by waves of
thought, form other colors, the colors being the
vibration o f the d ifferen t mental states and
planes.

sincere and keeps silen t about this power. It is not
to he discussed because people, being negat ive ,t hey
i
are quick to suggest e v il regarding the most sacred
of mysteries. "Cast not thy pearls before swine» is
the injunction o f master adepts— be silent but know.
INSTRUCTIONS
Place a chair in th is square, uttar the Sacred
Word and walk around it with your hands clasped in
back o f head over the Medula Oblongada, the e le ­
mental center in the brain. As you walk, mentally
bind the elements in the one you vis uaii^e , either
.
yourself or others, to obey your w i l l . You w in be
astounded. This is the strongest concentration pow­
er known to man.

them three times o r a lly , then sound Word., walk
fast and bind them more and more to the w i l l .
Then command them to obey with sharp commands
until you vibrate with power.
THOUGHT TRANSMISSION
Every thought vibrates a planetary center in
the brain, then in the hands. Therefore, i f one
can feel the center when it vibrates, they can
t e l l w:hat one’ 3 mind is cantered on. However,
this is a formally very secret s c ie n t ific know­
ledge. Th3 centers in the hand are according
to this diagram. The person being read must
concentrate and look in the demonstrator’ s hand,

The Secret 0f receiving the thought is in con­
centrations and breath control. A sligh t t ic k ­
lin g vibration comes in the canters in accord­
ance with the parsons’ thought, provided they
desire to be read. In case one does not receive
the vibration, th eir mind must visualize one o f
these centers, which is just as r e l i a b l e ,
Tha author uses this in his own demonstrations.
