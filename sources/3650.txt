EU MeNEs defires to corre& an error which he ſlipped into in the
latter part of the ſolution to Quºft. 808 in laſt year's Diary in finding.
the tenſion of the ſtring, viz. page 35, line 1, after prevent dele all the
reſt of the anſwer, and inſtead thereof inſert—and at the ſpontaneous
centre of rotation place S, which is thus found, as Mn : MR :: the
laſt-found upward force along mR : the effective force ačting along nE.
to turn the cylinder about S, which is the centre of percuſſion, when n
is that of rotation; conſeq. Sis a given point. And, as Sn: SN : :
the force ačting along nR.: that ačting along FN, in the ſenſe from
F towards N., making an angle PNF with the firing = RMn, the
inclination of the axis te the horizon. Conſeq. Mn nr. : : the force
along FN : that along PN, or the req. tenſion = W x nRx SNx
MRX MR ſq. divided by MaxSnx MaxMn ſq. which vaniſhes
when rR=o, or the axis is horizontal. I have here only to add, that
the preſſure of the water perp. to the baſe of the ſolid muſt be equal
to that of the ſolid in the contrary direétion; otherwiſe not reſt but
motion muſt enſue. -
We are ſorry here to announce the deaths of Mr. j. Fildes, of Li

Answers to the Questions critical and philoſophical.
CCXX. By The Propoſer. -
what is rendered Firmament in the text is Expanſion in the marginal
reading of our Bibles; and ſeems the more proper word of the two, be
cauſe the former ſeems to convey a n tion of ſomething ſolid.
This alſo ingeniouſly anſwered by Meſſrs. Cairns, Glendonning, Indi
gºna, and Rowe. ' - - --
ccxxi. By Sºftian B. of Bath.
In the works of Famianus Strada is a piece, entitled “Piſar Sub
ſurranus, five Problema, curſernientes ſalutentur.” Here we find that
the cuſtom of ſaluting ſneezers was in uſe among the ancient Greeks
and Romans, and was connected with retigion and aegºry; and, ac
cording to the time and other circumſtances in which it happened, was
confidered as a good or bad omen. With theſe opinions, it was natu
a by-flander, when a perſon foeezed at an ill-fated hour, to pray
ds to avert the omen. From the Romans the cuſtom may have
ded to our own times. Strada, however, isforms us, that, in
ne of "ope Gregory the Great, there raged a peſtilentiai diſeaſe,
lich ſneezing or yawning immoderately immediately preceded:
; and that, when ſneezing happened, it became cuſtomary te
:ate the like diſaſter. It muſt be acknowledged, however, that
ºr of theſe ſolutions is perfeółly ſatisfactory, and that the ougia.

. Salep is not an animal but a vegetable preparation, being a kind of
" facula or ſtarch, made from the loot of a ſpecies of Ö, chº. It, hew
ever, as the propoſer ſeems tº have imagined, it had been the died fleſkº
of the viper, i might nevertheleſs have been innocent and ſalubrious;
fince it is well known that the fleſh of this animal was formerly kept
in the apothecaries ſhops, and adminiſtered in various diſeaſes; and it
has been diſcovered that its properties do not differ from thoſe of the
white fleſh of ſome fiſh and fowls. The poiſon of the vaper is con:
fined to a ſmall bac, ſituated in its mouth. It would therefore be as:
reaſonable to expe&t that the whole body of an ox ſhould be bitter, be
cauſe its gall is ſo, as to ſuppoſe that the fleſh of a viper is poiſoneus,
becauſe a ſmall portion of poiſon is contained beneath its fatigº.
Ingenious anſwers to this, are alſo given by Meſſrs. Cairns, Gles

The paſſage in queſtion has the appearance of a poem, or piece of:
muſical compoſition, w;ich he or his ſon Tubal had made ; and might,
be a kind of exultation or rapture he was in on account of his ſon's in
vention of muſick; or a ſatirical ſpeech, where in he vaunted over the
poſterity of Seth, from which Cain and his offs ring had been exclu
ded communion. Fºr this reaſon he called one of his ſons Tubal Cain,
which ſignifies to return back again, or poſſeſſion. The import of the
ſpeech is this. Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my
ſpeech. Have I ſlain any man in wounding, or injured any old or
young in my hurt, that I, on account of my prºgenitor's miſcºnduct,
ſhould be excluded from the ſociety of men If the death of Cain,

Love's a gentle gen’rous paſſion, That falſejoy,which nowbewitches,
Source of all ſublime delights, When obtain'd, you will repeat;
Which, with mutual inclination, [ſawleſs paſſion brings vexation,
Two fond hearts in one unites, But a chaſte and gen’rous love
What are titles, pomp, or riches, Is the glorious emulation
Whencompar'dwih truecontent? Of the bliſsful ſtate above.
Says the poet; and I know no more beautiful or proper anſwer.
Mr. Rich. Shillitoe gives this different anſwer thus:
“The ſymptoms produced by Love as a diſeaſe are as follow : the
eyelids often twinkle; the eyes are hollow, and yet appear as if full
with pleaſure; the pulſe is not peculiar to the paſhom, but the ſame
with that which attends ſolicitude and care. When the obječt of this
affection is thought of, particularly if the idea is ſudden, the ſpirits are
confuſed, the putte changes, and its force and time are very variable.
In ſome inflances, the perſon is ſad and thoughtful; in others, not
being conſcieus of , is ſtate, he pines away, is flothful, and regardleſs
of food.” As the diſeaſe advances, an heótic fever, or a ſettled me
lancholy, comes on and cloſes the diſtreſsful ſcene. From the diſ
treſfing effects of this tender paſſion, when placed on a hopeleſs objećt,
how cautious and reſerved ſhould we be in courting this ſweet de
ſtroyer of repoſe. -

Cold is no doubt the proximate cauſe of this, but Idleneſs the effec

weather the quicker the motion muſt be. Warm the cream firſt, and
work away to prevent it from cooling at firſt, and never fear getting
butter.
Mr. Shillitoe ſays a little vinegar will in a few minutes produce the

kali, it will render the cream which is 'ſour and lumpy ſmooth and

jºſepbut ſays, that, previous to the Flood, the offspring of Seth
(which includes Enoch) engraved their diſcoveries in the arts and ſci
ences upon two pillars, the one of ſtone, to withſtand a deluge, the
other of brick, to endure a conflagration. Conſequently, if this rela
tion be fad, I think it manifeſt there might be books and writing, or
ſomething of the ſame nature, in the antediluvian world.
But, be all this as it may, it is the prophecy, and not the book of
Enoch, that is quoted by St. Jude, which might be traditionary for
generations, and not imply the neceſſity of the uſe of writing at the
time Enoch lived to tranſmit it to poſterity. And nearly of this opi

Answers to the Questions propoſed laſt year.
(t.) Quest. 827, anſwered by Lim Enus, Bruton, Somerſet.--
Right lines drawn from the ſame point, through the extremities and
points of divifion of a line, harmonically divided, are called harmo
nicals, and the nature of theſe lines is ſuch, that any right lines inter
fe&ting them will be harmonically divided; as is generally demon
ſtrated by Maclaurin, in his excellent treatiſe De Lin. Geom. Prop. Gen.
annexed to his Algebra, ſe&t. zo, et ſeq., ; where the reader may meet
with a complete inveſtigation of harmonical lines, and their application
to curves ef all orders. --
The ſame, by Mr. He NRY Walton, of Dumfries.
Let right lines Va, Vc, Vb, Va., be t
harmouicals meeting in the point V ;
if any right line parallel to one of
them, Va, meet the other right lines
in the points E, C, F, it will be bi
ſečted in C, or EC=EF; and if any
four harmonicals meet in any manner A
a right line in the points A, C, B, D,
it will be harmonically divided in thoſe points. See Dr. Hamilton's
Conics, Lem. I, B. 5; from which the reſt of this is taken. Part I.
Through C draw a parallel to the line ad, on which the harmonicals
are formed; and, meeting them in the points A, C, B, D, it is evident
that this line is divided in the ſame ratio as the line ad, i.e. harmoni
cally in thoſe points; therefore AD : AC ::BD : CB, but, becauſe VD,
Ec, are parallel, VD : EC (; ; AD : AC, i.e. as BD: CB, i.e.) as VD
: CF (becauſe VD, CF, are parallel); therefore EC, CF, are equal.
Part. II. Now let any right line meet four harmonicals in A, C,
B, D, and if thoſe harmonicals be parallel, the thing is evident; but,
if they interſe&t in V, draw ECF parallel to VD, the line moſt remote
from C; then, by the firſt part, EC=CF, and AD : AC :: VD : Ec
or CF. Therefore AD : AC ::BD: CB. q. e. d.
And thus nearly is the anſwer given by Meſſrs. G. mpbell, Furnaſ,
Glendenning, Rowe, and hºright.
(2) Quest. 828, anſwered by Mr.John wright,jun. Norley.

tion: fine of AB, or of ſun riſe before fix, and in the triangle ACO
as rad.: cotang. of latitude : : tang. of declination : the fine ºf AC,
time of eaſting after fix. From theſe two analogies it then anpears,
that the reëtangle under the fines of AB and AC is equal to the ſquare
of the tangent of declination which is given. Therefore, by prob. 30
of Simpſon's Algebra, we get AB-zoº 34, AC=11° 56', and the
latitude of the place is had = 52° 30' -

Let ABC be the triangle, AD, BE, and CF,

triangle made by joining the ends of theſe perps.
Then it is well known that a circle deſcribed
about the diam. AO will paſs through P and
E, and likewiſe another deſcribed about the
diam. OC will paſs through D and E ; there
fore, ſince the triangles are right-angled, and
have AOF=DOC common, the angle FAO A

From what has been done above is deduced the following
theorem. The difference of the ſquares of half the ſum of the fides of
any plane triangle, and the line biſecting the baſe, is equal to the rec
tangle of the ſegments of the baſe made at the point of contaét of the
inſcribed circle. -
The ſame differently, by Lim Enus, of Bruton, Somerſet.
Conſºr. Take any where a right line A = the given ſum of the fides,
B = the line biſecting the baſe, and C = the radius of the inſcribed
circle, alſo the baſe AB ſuch that AB: A : : #A2–B2—cº : #A*–

asd radius, of the inſcribed circle. From E, the middle of the baſe
AB, apply EC=B to a line drawn parallel to the baſe at the diſtance
of the perpendicular, and ACB will be the required triangle.
Demonſºr. Let p and a be the points of conta&t of the inſcribed circle
with AC and AB, and it follows from the conſtr. that the perimeter
; AC+CB—AB=2Ca : : #A*–CE* : C*; whence # perim. × ca.

an occultation muſt of courſe happen to ſome part of the earth at

within this limit (at the time of conjunétion) in leſs than about rs

muſt therefore follow that this ſtar cannot be eclipſed by the moon

* - Prize Question, by Eu Mr Nes.
To the aſtronomical Prize Queſtion in the Gentleman's Diary for 1781,
an anſwer is given the ſucceeding year by a very complex biquadratic
equation having all the terms. But it admits of a concluſion far more
elegant, and of the moſt ſimple form, requiring only to find a mean
proportional to two given right lines. Of this the demonſtration or
inveſtigation is here required?
