The following symbols are arranged in such a manner
that the student may find them an aid to studies.
Each symbol represents some study or particular part
of a study.
In Biology we seek for the origin of life and find that
it is the cell. The cell is symbolised by the small circle with
a point in the centre. Life is represented by the square
and here we find the four stages, Childhood, Youth, Maturity
and Old Age. The mind of man is capable of comprehending
life and so we look to the Triangle which represents mind
in its three aspects—Mind Conscious, Subconscious and
Superconscious,
The mind uses the brain for comprehension and the brain
is divided into three departments—the Cerebrum, Cerebellum
and the Medulla Oblongata.
The mind cognises the outside world through the five
senses and one' of the symbols known as the Pentagram
(five pointed star) symbolises the voluntary will which acts
upon the five senses. The voluntary will works throug-h
the Conscious Mind and the Cerebro-Spinal Nervous System.
The other Pentagram represents the Involuntary will
which works through the subconscious mind and the
Sympathetic Nervous System and controls the five physio-
logical systems.
The Hexagram (six-pointed star) symbolises the studies
which each student of the College becomes acquainted with
and as follows :
Physiology — The Science of the Body, Anatomy which
deals with the structure and economy of the body, Chemistry
which treats of elementary substances and the manner in
which .they are combined or separated, Psychotherapy which
deals with the cure of the mind by way of psychoses and
neuroses, Osteopathy (art of treating diseases by removing
structural derangement by means of manipulation) and
Chiropractic which concerns itself only with the manipulation
of the spine.
The Ellipse with an horizontal line in the centre symbolises
the state of the patient—par meaning normal health, below
par ill-health and above par abnormal health.
The two charts of the Brain scarce need any explanation
for they are dealt with in other text books of the College.
If each student studies these symbols for a little while
he will find out how easy it is to visualise them wherever
he may be and thus remember what each symbol represents.
