SIR,
SINCE you have eonferred on the Re.reretid R. Taylor the diP,IOiqll of
Bishop ofHell and Pande11folliua, and aioc:e, jn virtue of that office, he bit-
displayed his Neeromaneer's .funcCions for Raising the Dl!fJil, we beg lea~o
to inform yon aa a Christiandutythat we were preseqt last week t1 his Pan-
demoniul Lecture in the Rotunda. However, we must say that we felt
disappointed, since the raising the Detlll, aa promised in the bills, waa
nothing more than a vulgar Burletta for ra#ing Maaaon. in the shape of
copl!ers (a real permy-catching). Thus, w:hil1t be claniours agaiutPr~t.
craft, Cor their money-getting, bia DeoUcraft ia not lea thirsty after
coitled metal, and this in a pantomimical manner.
First of all, we do not consider hia person a Parson, sinee be revile~
Prieets, though dreaed in Priutlu Robu; noria he a Rabbi, or Dervil, or
Bonze, or Qllebra, or Lama, since be baa no religion at all; and aa he
hates Christianity, Bible, Chrilt, &e. be must. be ooneidered really
an Envoy of the ·8uhte"~ Metropolis-a Paranympb of the Mulato
Angels of tbe Lowi N egroUJNL Tbi.t it not an injury to him, siuce hu
glorie~ in that eapaeity. .
· Yet, ludicrous it is, that a man whc> burletiqu~·Scripturea, Gc>dbead,
Eternity, and the Soul's Immortality, should believe in SerpentiM AngeJr,
·und boast or being their Chaapion. Really, in all reeords or put age.~
it is diftleult to light upon 10ch a figure aa Master Tailor cut in the Ro-
tunda aa a Con.ftlror. Nor have we ever he&r\1 a diecourse in 10 astro~-
..UCal-colltkat,frent!lil!tll·poetical, dognwtical-lunaticala manner. Wecould
not observe other than anal Buffoon., representing a Tailor cuttiqg P.n·
taloons fur devils, being himself a Pcudaloon in tbe infernal arena. Ne-
•er ·did hfa Hpa pronounce a truth durlDfl two boon, except when be
stated himilelf to be tbe Devil'a Miniliter, and this waa truth in word and
·deed 1 11lidi~- from a Cmn- into a Collledian, and from a Coaed~"

lustrations, ceneers, altars, sacrifices) were all taken fa·om the MoNic re-
velations ; since from the Hebrew• did the Egyptil\ns copy ; from tl1e
Egypiana the Greeb, and from the Greekl the Romans. E\·en MytholOb"Y
it.elfderived many moral maxims from that Book of Revelations, though
di.guised in 1ymbola (aa Tertullian, Turmenin, and others demonstrate).•
Great is the antiquhy oftbisBook, origlnU fountain of recorded m·oraJs,
if we conaider Moaea the first known regiater of DOj,rmaa and Facta, who
wrote 1450 years before Christ, and 500 before Hvmer, the first celebrated
profane writer. ButtbisBook teachea Morality and Dogma;and not Astro-
logy. The new Teatament too, being penned by plain barefooted fiBber-
men, smells more of a Barge and Net than contemplations of ConateUa-
tiona. It is ridiculous to confound Theology with Astrology; but more
ridiculqus to confound Christ with Satan, allegorizing tbia notion in the
sucee&~ion of the D~y and Night, Night and :pay, aa if we could not apply
every alt~mative in.nature to that GRAND DISCOVERY of Mr. Taylor,
more ao, when the Book it.elf (which he pretends to burleaque) say•
1/wt eoer11thi:ng in £"reatiolt u· •ade of two opposites-Good, Eoil, Lif~,
DeatAt-so Day, Night, Truth, Error, &e. r
In fine, if the Bible is a composition of Falsehoods; HAFPY FALSE-
HOODS, we say, that huve such effect upon human nature, llS to correct our
Morale and angeli.z:e our Minds. HAPPY FALSEHOODS, that must be
divine, since they raise Man above his Nature. This Fable never did : and
this itmore than all the cant that any lying Ranter can prompt, wita. four
dancing ge1.twu aod two f11nrical Jesting.. Beside& if we dispute theae
sacred Recordt, we must.den11 ALL historical and sclentifiCill Registry
among mankind ; even attested Authorities inllll bn1nchesofScience ; since
all must &tand upon the faith given to their Authors. The Sacred Pages
41'8 attuted .by .Jewish Authors, as Flavius Joaephus: are atteated by
Profane Writers, as Suetoni111, Tacit111, Plini111: are attested by the SybiJa
in several ages. But what characterizes more this Book above the &Aol&-
ron oC Coiirucius, the Turkish Koran, the Indian Veidawt, and the Jewish
,TJ.allald, is the tound J,>oc~riue and angelical Morality it inspires, andthis
JROr~ .tlaan the gifts of Miracle and Prophecy. I say, Prophecy, for we
.aee veri~ed in the Law of Christ what was •badowed in the Mosaic Law.
And ~ point-oUt another examrle in the New Law ; we 11ee the Ap0etle1
(called Impostors) prophe&ied that in the latter tiMtu tltere •Mvld appitd.r
FIIUe M1Uter1, teaching Doctr~ of De~Ji4, denying ihe Lord. tluir Re-

Ate.~ This we see acccomplisbed in Mr. Taylor as Functionary oC the
Dark Realm&. He iaour Demon Python in the Rotanda'•Pit, in aIMfal
manner, d~rraded to the very dregs of Humanity-a real " RoasaT TBa
Davu.." The Sacred ·oracles proclaim aloud, there will come at lilt '
Antichrists ~·d Fulae Chl"ists: Mr. Taylor, bowe,·er, is forward in his
111i~Pn; he must await a bit; because time~ · are not yet fully ripe lor

thought be woulol now speak to us in the shape of a Goa.t, as we saw in
the Rotunda.
Now let us try the. weight of some or his Etymological discoveries. It
aeems that Mr•.Taylor derivet from the English Der1ce the Latin DellS
(God). This is alittle quidpro po, the eame as deriving thefountain from
the 1trN111, and not the ltrea111 from the fountain. But even supposing
be made a mistake in his expression against his meaning, pretending to
derive Derre from the Latin Deru, it is another quid pro quo if we listen to
Dr. Johnson, wh~ words are these, " Deuce, or rather Derl6e, de-
rives from Duliru, an ancient Species of ernl Spiril1, as attested by Con-
greve." Here we have two authorities against !Ur. Taylor, who want•
to bob the 7tlob with his scientific scraps, making tca:r no1e1 of his o10n ma-
nufacture. Another di~overy. The seven churches in the Revelations
are transplanted by Mr. Taylor into the Zodiac, and Asia (being Land of
Fire) means the Ethereal Spheres. Thus by this system or tranlpla,ta-
tion, Philadelphia (being Brotherly Lor;e) is applied to the 1ignor Gemini:
Laodicea (meaning J'Uit People) to Libra, &c. &c. Then, says Mr. Taylor,
these pa.seages being at first enigmatical and senseless, everybody mus\.
laugh : but after he opened the Se61a1114 with his Conjuror's key, be asks•
who now shall laugh r Well: be must know that we laugh heartily•
We never saw a thing so plain asa ChurcA, which he calls an enigma, ex•
plaininr; it by another enigJ;Ia. Here there is no oeeasioo to force the li•
teralae011e; especially whe•tben. exist evidences orsueb names in modem
Asia. Mr. Taylor interprets again•t the Hermenuetical rulea, confound-
ing ltiltoricalfacll with hia chimerical jingling of Judaizing,orZodiacizing
tbe Scriptures, and mistaking the Vilible in the World for tbe Vilionarv
in his Noddle. Who would say that St. John the Fisherman tunted Ma-
thematician by four tailor's teacbinga!!!! How·ever, much can be done by
the power of HOCUI POCUI. Our Tbeologer-Astrologer converts Cbria;t
into Satan; the Old Serpent into the Terraqueous Globe; the:Churches
in Alia into the Spherical Balle. (Without being seen, bow be play• these
balll.) He only touches each Church with bia magical stick, reading by
his book, and tala! in the twinkling of an eye off they go into the Sky.
Pao·DI·GI·ous! II However,_we do not admire this trick: because the
Celestial Signa being twelve, there wantajive Churches more to make up
the other five signe. Therefore either St. John was a bad Astrologer, or
Mr. Taylor is a bad Interpreter. Perhaps be meiuul to say that Religion
led from Men into the Stan in this epoch : but he should not explain an
allegory by another allegory. However, thanks for his Dilcover~•. he
being~ a higher man tba~ Hipparcbua, 'rycbo, Kepler, Hevelius, Galileo,
Cuaini, Herschel, Olbers. Hardi"i• and others -who have only found
out some Stan or Groups, without seeing Inhabitant&; but Mr. Taylor has
seen realChurchu!!! PRO-DI-GI·OUS! I!! II!!!
From the above remarks we may judge of the rest. Mr. Tailor wants
to aupplant tbe Bible by book and by crook. Yet hi• per1on will soon
disappear like a phantom, and the Book will remain as it hasstood through
all centnriea, mangre the puny pinches of the impious of all ages. Ir he
pretend• to a ne10 10il and a IU!W 61/ftem, be must know that bi1 talea bav~
