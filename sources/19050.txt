in just a minute i want to welcome
everybody that is joining us from all

uh very important notes that i need to
get out of the way
disclosure fest and the mass meditation
initiative which was to be held on june
20th in downtown los angeles at the
historic
los angeles park right next to chinatown
last year we had uh
20 000 attendees we were anticipating
uh 25 000 attendees this year
it is the largest single day uh
gathering of its kind anywhere in the
world
we have moved the date uh because of
the worldwide crisis we are going
through to
august 8th now if you go which is a
saturday if you go to disclosurefest.org
all of the information is there for you
in case
anything goes wrong and today
anything is possible we also have two
other reserve dates
with the city of los angeles and the
state of california
in uh september and october now that
being said a couple of exciting things
that happened
over the last month our feed your souls
initiative
has fed uh 300 people a week
down on skid row we want to get that
number up
to a thousand and all of that is done
with
your donations that you can do directly
over at disclosurefest
uh dot org and with with all of that
uh with today today is a very important
show and
having uh dr stephen greer not only here
with us
but part of disclosure fest and coming
out to los angeles for the big event
later on this summer his work
for the last 30 years and its importance
cannot be measured
and for him to take the time again to
join us today
is so very very important and i want to
thank you dr greer for joining us
again how are you i&#39;m doing great i&#39;m uh
surviving the police state lockdown all
right
and uh we&#39;re out here at the country
house in the mountains of virginia
so at least it&#39;s beautiful and although
a bit rainy today
but um you know we&#39;re doing fine and you
know
about things being rescheduled
by everyone listening to my channel i
know you guys are expecting the premiere
for close encounters of the fifth
kind it has not been cancelled it was
postponed from
april 6th jimmy was going to be there
and a whole lot of other folks
unfortunately we don&#39;t know when la live
will reopen
because at the bin is a thousand people
and
it&#39;s not clear to me when and if they&#39;ll
allow a gathering of that size
indoors uh even this summer so
again as soon as we know you&#39;ll know but
we can&#39;t i don&#39;t control the state of
california and i don&#39;t control the city
of los angeles and
we just have to do the best we can do
you know we had a whole bunch of events
we&#39;re going to do this year and
for folks around the world and have
various premieres in europe and
australia and elsewhere but
obviously this has thrown a monkey
wrench into that
so um i just want to let people know we
are still planning to do it
when and if we get clear to open now
the exciting news i mean we&#39;re all
getting acclimated for
the wrong and right reasons to being
controlled right now we never thought
it would come to this but the exciting
news is
uh i have been following uh
close encounters of the fifth kind and
what it is doing out there in the world
it is uh still number one on amazon and
at the top of
all of the network streaming that is
going on
that says to me a couple of things uh
that
people are getting the message right
they they want this information but for
you it&#39;s got
it&#39;s got to be exciting to have all this
hard work pay off
right yeah well you know the plan always
was
30 years ago when i had a visit
from ets that approached me in my house
in north carolina i&#39;m
running this very busy emergency
department i&#39;m an er doctor
and you know the the plan was always
to try to build this to an awareness
where there were millions of people
who were doing higher consciousness
meditation practices
as a means for connecting to these
civilizations
through their paradigm which is that one
of
universal consciousness and non-locality
in physics as we&#39;ve spoken about
and but the process of getting there has
been
of course arduous and along the way i
realized i had to do something
a little thing called founding the
global disclosure
project movement to end the secrecy on
this because in my naivete
as a young doctor in 1990 when this
started it was exactly 30 years ago by
the way
for everyone it&#39;s our 30-year
anniversary of uh you know the center
for the study of extraterrestrial
intelligence and
our motto is you can see it one universe
one people
uh the foundation of our relationship
with each other
and these cosmic beings is this field of
consciousness that we&#39;ll get into in a
moment
but i knew that it would be sort of a
difficult thing to do because we have a
couple of controversial paradigms
one is that we&#39;re not alone in the
universe which shouldn&#39;t be
controversial
but because of ridicule and secrecy it
has been and the other
is having people who have been
miseducated about the nature
of themselves and of consciousness in
their own mind
and their own empowerment that there had
to be
an outreach to understanding something
beyond the
linear reductionist scientific paradigm
not that that would be put aside but
that we would add to it this concept
of other dimensions higher states of
consciousness
the nature of the mind is something not
limited to space and time
a dr russell targe and i last week had a
great discussion about that for about an
hour and a half
and i think that it has been a very long
road
but what&#39;s really exciting for me is to
see that people i have never
known personally like there&#39;s a woman
who is a very big pop singer uh
apparently named
uh my kids was sam really lame uh demi
lovato
you said it right you said
good so shout out to demi and because
she did this
great interview on stevio and then she
tweeted out
to 36 million people about how
she really loved close encounters of the
fifth kind i want to reach out to her
and tell her she needs to get the app
the clip ce5 contact app because the
movie introduces you to these concepts
the app is actually a full on remote
viewing training program
ce5 training program it it has a
networking function
so you can see who is in your
geographical area
and make contact with them to form a
group
even if it&#39;s a virtual group at this
stage or small group
and by the way you know if a state
allows five people or ten people to get
together
you can make a circle six feet apart you
can still social distance and get
together and do this so
uh i think that you know what i&#39;m
finding is that there are a lot of folks
following this
like jenny mccarthy and the wahlberg her
husband donnie wahlberg i was on their
show
and i had no idea they were interested
in this
and what&#39;s really exciting is to see
that on every level of society
um people are getting interested i mean
even fox news had me on last week on the
laura ingraham show
i saw a very conservative show and it
was sort of shocking
but in fact i found that you know a lot
of people are saying oh my god how could
you be on that network i said
to me this subject transcends all those
normal fracture lines of
left right conservative all the labels
because we&#39;re dealing with something
that is interplanetary and cosmic
and i i really don&#39;t see this breaking
along the usual fractured lines of our
society
of all these tribalistic fighting
factions i see this as something that is
inherently unifying that transcends
that cacophony of conflict you know
yeah i think that&#39;s the part of this
that
as someone who&#39;s sort of in the center
of this uh
you know where i&#39;m getting contacted by
every kind of
uh person like there there&#39;s a a great
rock band if you like
heavy metal called godsmack well the
lead guy
sully erna has reached out to me and he
put out a tweet and
saw the movie and is really excited so
there are all kinds
and there&#39;s a band called tool
yeah they&#39;re really into this i was with
them backstage you know when they were
in this area not long ago but what i&#39;m
finding is that there are people from
all walks of life
uh whether it&#39;s left right politicians
scientists uh pop culture
folks who are realizing that this is
the future of our civilization is to
become interplanetary
but also that the foundation for that is
understanding
a deep aspect of our spirituality that
transcends
um the normal tribalism that humans
break into
yeah well what i wanted to mention
before we get out of time
uh run out of time is the elephant in
the room which was
last week uh the navy and the pentagon
uh officially you know with quotes uh
released these three videos and
the media shows no signs of letting up
and covering
et uap slash ufo coverage and that&#39;s the
exciting part
but the other side of it is especially
with
everything that&#39;s happening with close
encounters of the fifth kind right now
the response from the world seemed to be
more muted than some of the breaking
news that we&#39;ve had over the last uh two
years on this subject did that surprise
you
no because we&#39;re in the middle of a
global pandemic that has
collapsed our economic system
where we we&#39;re heading into something
that will be worse than the great
depression if we&#39;re not careful
so i think you know in that media with
with that going on
it&#39;s very difficult for for people to
focus
um in any real depth in terms of the
mainstream media on on something like
this because
unfortunately the reporting on this
subject always stops at the superficial
in other words
here&#39;s something that the uh these
pilots were chasing and here&#39;s the
footage
and it&#39;s something quote we don&#39;t
understand
it never if you look at mainstream media
it never goes any deeper
than that for example what are they
where they come from i quickly held up
on fox news this letter from ben
rich who is the head of the lockheed
skunk works the
super secret aerospace contracting
outfit um there up in the desert of
california
and uh and it was a letter from ben rich
stating very specifically
that there were two types of ufos
hours meaning man-made
electromagnetographic
anti-grav devices and e.t
and uh and he states this in his own
handwriting
all right what was the response from fox
oh well it was a very short you know big
network things are you know
two three four minutes so i mean i
basically all that was said as well
there&#39;s a lot to unpack here
but the issue is one of my point is
making is that the issue never goes
beyond that
except that in the case of the pentagon
footage
it reopened the door and this is what it
was really about
right just as this documentary that
exposes
the the false flag alien threat
narrative which is in the opening first
chapter of close encounters of the fifth
kind if you&#39;ve seen the movie
um they re-release this
footage but it gives the opportunity
for the disinformation specialist if you
looked at the coverage
and wrote read it all the way through at
the very end of every story
was it&#39;s a threat to our national
security it&#39;s a threat to our airspace
again it was an opportunity for them to
subliminally
reinforce this threat narrative which
has been
the purpose of the release of that
footage since
late 2017 in december 2017.
so that was always the agenda we knew
that i mean i immediately got an email
from a very senior cia person who&#39;s
worked the ufo subject for decades and
said
this is the same bunch of people who
have been scamming the us government
and the american public and the media
for decades i&#39;m quoting
and we knew that right away and that was
because
unacknowledged which had gone over onto
various platforms and eventually got
over 600 million
viewers was so trending that they wanted
a counter measure to tamp down that
narrative
right now just as this documentary is
trending
and it&#39;s number one all over the world
in fact amongst
all movies including 100 million 200
million dollar feature films
it&#39;s in the top 30 which is unheard of
for a crowdfunded indie documentary
so surprise they really
re-release this footage which gives the
opportunity for the spin
masters of disinformation to attach
the threat narrative to it which is of
course the opposite of the narrative and
message that we&#39;re putting out
and that is that there&#39;s no evidence
that these civilizations are a threat
the threat is the national security
state deceiving
us that there is one basically hoaxing
the threat so uh i i don&#39;t you when
people said are you surprised that this
came out again i said no
i was i&#39;m expecting this sort of thing
this is what
counterintelligence always
tries to neutralize any sort of movement
away from the narrative of
disinformation that they specialize in
and so the pentagon officially i can
tell you that when this came out in
december
of 2017 that was an official release
it was just it was just through a a cut
out group
an organization that was chock full of
cia
and pentagon and lockheed people
who uh made it look like they got their
hands on it and were able to release it
and then they attached this alien threat
narrative
in reality that was always part of the
covert program it&#39;s just being
reinforced
where they can milk that story again by
re-releasing
it last week with the narrative again
that it&#39;s a threat to our airspace a
threat to our armed forces a threat
a threat a threat why do they need a
threat because they need to prop up
the war mongers and the big the big
folks out there who are making
trillions of dollars on the status quo
of world conflict
and how the world is operating which is
on a tribalistic war footing we always
have to find someone to be killing and
hate
you know who&#39;s the new people to hate
yeah
you know yeah they have to create a new
enemy right
right right i mean that that&#39;s what all
propagandists
who are in governments know is that in
order to
maintain their power through fear they
have to manifest a new enemy so
i think that this isn&#39;t surprising that
that this would happen and
i&#39;m predicting that this will be more of
these things will happen
yeah i find it interesting that they&#39;ve
actually officially released these now
three times right if you think about it
you and i talked about it in december
2017.
we talked about the uap coverage last
year uh
extensively uh that was another official
acknowledgement coming out of the navy
in the pentagon
and then now very interestingly they&#39;ve
released it a third time
with the fear narrative when the fear
uh pummeling of the public has been
going on for two or three months now
in mass media and it&#39;s an opportunity
and it&#39;s also timed with the release of
close encounters of the
uh of the fifth kind right and and i
think you know the problem
is that you know a lot of things are
real
that are things we should be concerned
about uh for example
elderly and and people who have
underlying conditions are really
threatened by this
current crisis of course it&#39;s
interesting if you look at the
statistics from a couple years ago
influenza killed 172 children
uh the last i checked on the cdc site
this
particular crisis there have been three
so that it&#39;s 150th is
and yet all you know we have this
situation where
if you were to go to the public the
impression is that
younger people and children are dropping
dead like flies
but they&#39;re not so i think that one of
the concerns i
always have is that a crisis
becomes an opportunity for people who
would like to take away our liberties
and our freedoms
and they can create something that&#39;s a
legitimate crisis i&#39;m not saying it&#39;s
not
and then capitalize on it
so this is what we have to be very very
careful of going forward in terms of
disclosure
and making contact is that there are
folks who are going to try to
spin any situation to their
fascist police state uh
agendas and this is why we have to be
ever vigilant
for our freedoms and our liberty because
there are folks who
will try to capitalize on that
if we&#39;re not awake do you feel that
the public when i say public i mean the
the earth
especially today is now
finally becoming aware of that message
that we&#39;ve been talking about for so
many years
which is uh fear is a way of control now
they&#39;ve seen it 24 hours a day for
months on end now
is it are you and i uh vindicated
somewhat and the rest of us that have
been speaking about this for so long
yes but i think that i think the thing
that is worrying me the most
and i want to be careful what i&#39;m saying
here so i don&#39;t
get erased here right um if you
get my drift folks and that is
when when i see um
national guard troops outside
a neighborhood safeway
in in washington dc
along with police force for
people going to get their bread and
orange juice and food for the
day and no one
no one is going what the hell
what&#39;s going on here in other words
i know i&#39;m dating myself for those of us
who are the 60s 70s generation
you know this kind of police state
tactic
over something that&#39;s a health care
issue and there&#39;s no civil unrest going
on
would it there have been massive massive
enormous pushback from
the population for the overreach of
police state tactics
right now everyone&#39;s going oh they&#39;re so
obsequious and obedient and conformist
they&#39;re going oh okay okay okay because
they have everyone coward
they have everyone terrified and i think
that
this actually does concern me i&#39;m going
to be very blunt here
i am very concerned that that
in our society the the compliance and
the conformity
and the sort of groveling before state
power is very dangerous
it&#39;s necessary when it&#39;s necessary to
obey rules and laws i&#39;m not saying i&#39;m
an i&#39;m not an anarchist at all
but i&#39;m saying when those powers get
abused
and there is widespread unthinking
unquestioning compliance
we&#39;re in trouble we have really got to
step back and go
oh wait a minute here and there&#39;s a lot
of
misinformation going out so in the same
way what you see with disclosure
is you will have people where something
will begin to happen
and then the momentum will be hijacked
by people who spin it in the direction
of fear
hatred of all things alien etc and so on
and i think that an awake populist
what eisenhower said you know the
populist needs to be awake
to the threats to our democracy and our
security
by the excesses of the
military-industrial complex
and eisenhower said that because he had
been betrayed by those same people
on the ufo et issue we know this for a
fact
so we have to look at how
our response to a crisis is is it
appropriate is it measured are we
letting
authorities who always get drunk with
power
abuse that power or are the weak putting
them in check
now this is very important in the ufo
subject
because it is so ripe for abuse in terms
of scaring people
because let&#39;s face it generally people
are afraid of the unknown
and the word alien means foreign
although i don&#39;t use that term because
it&#39;s non-specific when you say alien do
you mean someone from
guatemala or another country or other
country
or another dimension that&#39;s not e.t but
it&#39;s from another dimension and not
extraterrestrial
it&#39;s too i never used the term alien for
that reason
those of you listening because i think
words
mean something and so i use the word dt
or extraterrestrial biological life form
or something to that effect
to be specific but i think that what
we&#39;re
seeing and by the way is cinco de mayo
happy cinco de mayo to everyone
i think we should honor the cultures of
the native peoples
uh of america latin america south
america
because in their culture the star people
and the brothers and sisters from the
stars even right here i&#39;m looking at
shenandoah national park
shenandoah is believed to be a derived
from a native american word that means
a sister from the stars or sister of the
stars
right so you know and i&#39;m part cherokee
my dad was half
cherokee native american so i kind of
look at this and i go
there are a lot of people around the
world that really do understand the idea
that we&#39;re not alone in the universe and
that that&#39;s a normal part of
understanding
but what the military-industrial complex
realized
between the 40s and the late 50s
is that they could really make hair out
of as i&#39;m quoting from a cia document
that said
then where they can use the
psychological
warfare value of ufos i&#39;m quoting
from a cia document officially released
by the way
uh on this issue and that&#39;s what&#39;s
happened for 70 years
is that it&#39;s been taken and spun into
this direction
by people who obviously have a an agenda
that isn&#39;t about peace and exploration
of space peacefully their agenda is
trying to create the next boogie man
that everyone should be terrified about
and so when that when the pentagon
released those
uh videos again re-release that i&#39;m
saying i&#39;m not saying release i&#39;m saying
re-released
three times yes three times that i knew
that there was going to be this entire
uh attached narrative which actually
happened
um and you know the anecdote for that
kind of disinformation quite honestly
is close encounters of the fifth kind
people understanding that
there is the reason the first and i
haven&#39;t said this to you yet
the reason the director and i put that
first chapter
in there which doesn&#39;t have anything per
se
to do with contact and consciousness
and the ce5 protocols but we used up
the first 20 some minutes of that film
to it
to try to to use a contemporary term
inoculate the population from the
fear-based
disinformation narrative of there being
a threat from outer space
that we felt that we had to put that in
there because most of the public have
already been brainwashed
that this is a threat and if you really
think it&#39;s a threat
you&#39;re not going to sit out in your
backyard or in a state park
doing ce5 protocols and inviting to make
contact
because you&#39;ve already been convinced
these are
scary beings that you should be afraid
of right so
this i call it the contagion the viral
contagion of fear
is is what these spin meisters at the
cia and pentagon and counterintelligence
are expert at and we&#39;ve got to be
awake to the fact that we need to uh
counter
that disinformation and manipulation
because that&#39;s how you get into a
disaster like the iraq war
that&#39;s how you get after 911 that&#39;s how
you get into a disaster like vietnam
that&#39;s how you get civilizational
collapse
over something like that&#39;s happening
right now
if we over extend our response to it
that is how you get into an
interplanetary conflict
or an interplanetary war so you know
these are
huge stakes here we&#39;re talking about and
that&#39;s why i think we need people who
are going to be telling people the truth
and not get sucked into this contagion
of fear
because i think what we really uh have
to fear is fear itself
but i think more importantly being
manipulated
into having a compliant conformist
uh acceptance of what the authority
figures are telling
us so if the authority figures who are
attached
to the government to the pentagon even
scientific entities say oh yes
those are real objects we were chasing
but they&#39;re a threat to our armed forces
they&#39;re a threat to our national
security
and people believe that in this sort of
pavlovian response this
automatic response that you&#39;re seeing
now with this current crisis
without anyone questioning uh what&#39;s
actually going on
i think we could be in real trouble uh
down the road and this is why this is
i think this is a big wake-up call uh
and
you know the timing of it is strange um
that you know we&#39;re releasing this huge
uh movement and and expanding the ce5
global peace initiative which is what it
is
it&#39;s a interplanetary peace initiative
is what we&#39;re doing
and we go into lockdown and then we have
the
re-release of this footage with that
narrative it&#39;s all very
strange you could call it a series of
coincidences
but knowing how what i know having met
with a lot of people at the cia in
pentagon
i think it&#39;d be a little too convenient
by twice
that it&#39;s an actual coincidence with uh
so many out there that want disclosure
and need disclosure i mean let&#39;s face it
uh disclosure
and our community the people that are
with us
dr greer are here for emotional reasons
personal reasons there are
things that bring them here and for them
for the own resolve in their minds
the only form of disclosure for them
is a head of state like the president on
live television
right and but it&#39;s probably
never going to happen that way we know
this so
how do we start to affect the change
what&#39;s the best approach
we do the disclosure that&#39;s what the
reason i
did the disclosure project is that i had
already met with
the white house folks and this cia
director
and top people in the senate
intelligence committee personally
face to face in extensive meetings it
was made very clear to me that those
people
almost to a fault were not read into or
had access to those projects
when they inquired as you know admiral
wilson had this happen or denied access
or were threatened if they pushed too
hard and
that if they did find out like ronald
reagan did president reagan
they&#39;re surrounded by a bubble of people
who come in and tell them
that this is a national security threat
so for example people went up on capitol
hill
after the initial release of that
footage from
the pentagon in 2017 and there were
closed door briefings that i have
personal knowledge of
of members of that same team and cabal
of disinformation specialists
who are briefing members of the senate
and house intelligence and armed
services
telling them the most terrifying things
about ufos
i know that happened for a personal fact
so
what i&#39;m saying is this is why we have
to be
ever vigilant but ultimately disclosure
consists of we the people
bypassing that circus and making contact
and i i said this back in the early 90s
the ultimate
first of all seen as believing so if you
look at close encounters of the fifth
kind there&#39;s just
dozens and dozens and dozens of photos
and videos of amazing
ce5 contact events well those
many of those i wasn&#39;t even there it was
people who had
practiced the protocols understood how
they work went out and gave it a whirl
and it happened
so i&#39;m telling people that if you have
millions and millions of people do that
who needs the cia and the pentagon or
the president to disclose something
it&#39;s not like we don&#39;t have a brain or
mind and the et&#39;s aren&#39;t watching
why do we need this intermediary
intermediary
of a bunch of sociopathic craven power
hungry politicians
and government bureaucrats to validate
something we all know is true already
why don&#39;t we go and validate it
ourselves see that&#39;s always been my
argument
because the definition of a close
encounter of the fifth kind
is a human initiated and cooperative
contact event
point to point us to the visitors
and it isn&#39;t where we have to run it
through
the national security state and in fact
that was the very first thing that the
army intelligence director
and others threatened me with they said
you have no
clearance to be doing this i said i
don&#39;t need your permission
you can go pound salt i mean you know
how i am i&#39;m
yes i&#39;m nice until i&#39;m not nice
and then it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s hell on wheels
but i i what i&#39;m saying is that i just
said you know i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t
recognize your authority i said that
right to the face of the head of army
intelligence
and his cia and nsa minions and this was
in 92
and after the thing happened in florida
where we had these four craft appear
and it got on the in the newspaper and
the intelligence community went
ballistic
they were very upset so what i said for
almost 30 years to these folks is you
have your agenda
we need to have the people create their
own agenda
what is the people&#39;s agenda do we all
benefit from being scared
out of our minds and going to
interplanetary war or do we benefit from
disclosure
direct contact and coming together also
let me just throw this in here the third
pillar the part of this triangle is
the release of the technologies that
would give us a new civilization with no
poverty or pollution
the so-called zero-point anti-grav
technologies
that is not going to happen in a world
where you have a thousand trillion
dollars in
assets tied up in fossil fuels and
the electric power grid as it is etc and
so on
it&#39;s going to have to happen from the
grassroots up
but guess what anyone listening listen
up listen very carefully
oil went sub-zero meaning that it was
less than a
zero dollar per barrel on the futures
zero
uh it&#39;s down so low that
now right now listen to me
would be an awesome time for someone to
get out of their own way
who have these technologies and get them
disclosed
and bring them out why because the
economy has already
been fallen into ashes that&#39;s a really
good point the oil is
already uh virtually worthless it takes
60
a barrel to pull it out of the ground in
texas and it&#39;s selling for
15. so this would be
actually an excellent time to come out
with the disclosure of that technology
i don&#39;t have it the people who have
developed them
think that they&#39;re going to do it
secretively and monetize it
what i&#39;m recommending is we do an open
source
massive disclosure of an operating
new energy device that would run your
house or business
or a city without any fossil fuels solar
wind
jew thermal whatever this these really
advanced systems
the problem is is that we either have to
start a laboratory to do that
from scratch or we need someone who
understands that
you cannot do intellectual property
and patent around something that is
instantly going to be seized by
jack-booted thugs i&#39;m using that word
literally because i know people that
have had that happen i&#39;ve had it happen
with a member of my team who is
developing one of these for
us and had jack-booted thugs come in so
the only way we&#39;re going to be able to
do it if someone has one
operating then i will happily take
whatever risk
personally to massively disclose it
with the plans for it open source
meaning there&#39;s
no secrecy anyone who has is skilled in
the art
of engineering can assemble it build it
and let it run
but it needs to be vetted it can&#39;t be
snake oil almost everything out there on
the internet
on the in this space when you drill down
on it and get
engineers to test it they&#39;ve either have
mismeasured the power dynamics or it&#39;s
an outright
fraud be honest with you but if
someone&#39;s got a real one let me just say
this if someone&#39;s got something
legitimate
please contact me at
siriusdisclosure.com
s-i-r-i-u-s disclosure.com and we will
see that it is massively disclosed and
at this point
because for better for worse the profile
we have
i can get that out in front of hundreds
of millions of people no question about
it
and i don&#39;t need the mainstream media to
do it i will be on
every influencer show from joe rogan to
logan paul to
demi lovato with one of these things
operating
where the intellectual property listed
has
already been shoved off into the
pipeline so nobody can confiscate it
it&#39;s out there dispersed to a million
places
my friends that is the only way you&#39;re
going to get this environmental
and macroeconomic and poverty issue
solved and right now given the fact that
the economy has fallen into ashes
and fossil fuels are absolutely at rock
bottom would be an
awesome time to do it are you afraid
uh i mean what are your thoughts of so
many
uh
individuals personalities in the
alternative uh
space over the last month have been
de-platformed removed uh demonetized
censored across all platforms and
it seems like any of us uh in this
in this little slice of the world now is
walking on eggshells
and they do it without dr greer as you
know
uh without any warning there isn&#39;t any
uh explanation it just happens
right right and that&#39;s not what we uh
have fought for on this planet
right we fought for the opposite of that
so much for freedom of speech
right are you worried are you worried
about speaking out about things like
this right now
i&#39;m not uh there are certain things like
i can&#39;t i
am not saying i had uh an event planned
um to live stream last week or week
before
and i had to cancel it because it was
made quite clear to me
um we would probably be banned
so i have to be careful because we don&#39;t
have free speech anymore
um you have you know there&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s
we&#39;re in a terrible situation
uh because the window if you look at the
documentary
close encounters of the fifth kind
there&#39;s a place in there
where we mention and then uh the
attorney daniel shin
states we still have the internet and we
still have some free speech
but that window is closing this is what
it was very prescient
because it&#39;s in the documentary people
need to see this documentary
because it&#39;s in there and by the way if
you get it
on vimeo or itunes you get uh three of
these special features
that is that entire interview with
daniel sheehan my entire interview in
the batcave
and the compilation of all the ce5
photos and videos in one collection
um but though you have to get it at
either vimeo or itunes to get those
just so people know but i think that
that&#39;s
that&#39;s something that we have to to to
be aware of
um and be we have to
we&#39;re sort of walking a tightrope and so
you just have to do the best you can
with the
situation um that you&#39;re you&#39;re in i
mean we&#39;re a small
pretty much unfunded operation with no
office and staff
i certainly don&#39;t own a trillion dollar
new media company
like alphabet or whoever uh out google
to control this uh neither do you um
and therefore we just have to do the
best we can uh
within the the increasingly tight
box that they&#39;re putting free speech in
well let&#39;s uh i want to thank you for
this conversation
uh we&#39;re going to move things uh
forward now dr greer is going to for the
next 15 minutes
uh have a meditation with everybody here
i&#39;m going to sign off and in 15 minutes
i&#39;ll be back with dr greer
uh to wrap things up but a great
conversation
doctor take it away and i&#39;ll see you in
about 15 minutes yeah
i will see you i&#39;m just doing to do an
introduction to um
consciousness and mind and i&#39;m gonna
lead a a simple meditation technique
uh that will involve the healing of the
earth a mass consciousness meditation
for everyone
this is gonna be great i&#39;ll see you in
15 minutes time to do it thank you
okay oh look that&#39;s nice look behind my
i don&#39;t know how you&#39;re looking uh
behind this shoulder
um there&#39;s a beautiful symbol it&#39;s the
seasidi triangle
and vicki a member of our team in
colorado
made this rug she made it by hand
uh and it&#39;s so cool so we put it on an
easel or a music stand so you could
guys could see it and i&#39;d like to thank
vicky for making that for us it&#39;s
beautiful
so uh what what i want to do now for
this part of the show
is to first introduce the concept
of consciousness in mind
and just review for a moment
the fact that if you if you look at the
science of this
the mind whereby you&#39;re hearing my voice
and i&#39;m looking around the room
and at this screen the consciousness not
what you&#39;re conscious of
but the conscious stuff the field of
consciousness itself
is unbounded so
i hear you jimmy jimmy you&#39;re not muted
um and yeah
jimmy i hear you jimmy i
i i well you know what uh uh
it&#39;s all good at least um hey tell t
uh michael why don&#39;t you tell jimmy that
his mike
jimmy you don&#39;t realize that okay
i i don&#39;t have both of us talking at the
same time
so anyway so that field of consciousness
is a singularity
and this is you know the beautiful quote
from the physicists
of schrodinger who said the total number
of minds in the universe is one
it&#39;s a singularity now we&#39;ve been
trained
that our consciousness and mind
is actually uh
just in our skull and just in the room
where we are
but the truth of it is is that the
science of consciousness is proven
definitively that the
mechanism whereby we are awake that
field consciousness
isn&#39;t limited by time or space which
means that when you quiet the mind and
connect
to that quiet space within you can
effect remote places this is what remote
viewing is you can see a remote place
not only in in space but in time
in the future or in the past or right
now and it also means
that in in the in the conscious
capacity that every awake being has
we have the ability to affect
remote places this is what the random
number generators that dr john at
princeton was doing
where they would put their minds on a
random number generator and it would
affect
whether it&#39;s putting out zeros or ones
by people just
thinking to it so this
science of consciousness is really
settled science and dr targa and i
discussed that last week where
the science behind this is very very
clear
that our own awareness and you don&#39;t
have to be ingo swan
or a sort of a renowned psychic to do
this
but every single conscious awake being
their awareness is actually originating
in this non-local unbounded
infinite field of consciousness that we
can all connect to
now why is that important it&#39;s because
when we do this
one on one person at a time we can have
these sort of amazing experiences
when we do it collectively the effect it
has
on our environment is exponential
and they found this also with studies
that people who would be in a room
and they would be meditating
and putting their awareness say on a
random number generator would have a
certain effect
if there were two people who were loved
each other or were bonded together
the effect was not twice as much but
10 times as much exponential so when you
have a
mass group like right now however many
people do this together
it has an effect in your environment and
for the whole planet
and in fact because it&#39;s not limited by
space
in the entire cosmos so you begin to
realize that each one of us
are a quantum hologram of consciousness
we&#39;re folded within us the entirety of
the cosmos in creation
uh is present even though our conscious
minds are usually shut off to
most of it we&#39;re only open to our five
senses
but in the meditative state you can
become aware of
remote places in space or time and
remote dimensions
now the reason this is also really
important for making contact with
extraterrestrial life forms
is that because of the limits of the
speed of light which is what your
you know your cell phone or your
transmission is doing the speed of light
electromagnetic
is too slow like one of the et&#39;s that
visited us
in joshua tree was from the andromeda
galaxy well that&#39;s two and a half
million light years from here that means
at the speed of light it would take two
and a half million years to say hello
and then signal to get there and another
two and a half million years
for that planetary command center let&#39;s
call it
to answer back and say how are you doing
today that just took
5 million earth years to do that one
exchange
that&#39;s why we know all of these
interstellar civilizations
are also trans-dimensional using
consciousness
and thought but also with very advanced
technologies
that interface with things that look
like a cell phone but they&#39;re actually
interfacing with thought forms
and with the quanta of thought so i
wanted to do that as sort of an
introduction
uh sort of quickly of of what
the potential is within our own
conscious mind
that the conscious mind that we have
is actually not limited to
us we are sort of the light within us
you can look at yourself as a window an
opening to the cosmos
and your individuality is illumined by
the light of consciousness
but doesn&#39;t trap it we trap it in our
own belief system
but the truth of it is is that your
conscious mind
mind is a singularity it&#39;s one conscious
field
and so when we come together in that
joined
space of pure consciousness
and then we meditate and we intend
something wonderful to happen
like the healing of the planet the
guidance of our planet into the future
it actually alters the timeline of the
future
it actually manifests that good future
and that&#39;s why in close encounters of
the fifth kind we included the studies
very briefly where they showed that if
one percent
of the population of a community were
meditating together
it caused crime rates to go down
emergency room visits to go down
greater coherence and peaceful behavior
in the community
and the other 99 of the population had
no idea
those people were in the city so that
kind of
knowledge is very empowering to us as
individuals
because it takes a relatively small
number of people
to have an when they&#39;re doing something
very positive
in consciousness and understanding what
the conscious field is
to cause something wonderful to happen
in our planet and we need something
wonderful
to happen we need this planet to get on
its path of being transformed
and put into an entirely new
civilization
so that&#39;s what the purpose of this
meditation is so i&#39;m going to do that
for about the 10 minutes
i&#39;m going to lead a meditation and i&#39;d
like for everyone right now to just make
yourselves
comfortable wherever you are i&#39;ll try to
because i have to stay locked into
where i&#39;m in camera here and
i&#39;m cl we&#39;ll all close our eyes together
so let&#39;s close our eyes
and now i&#39;d like for us
to become very centered and quiet
and then begin to lightly focus on your
breathing
and take some nice deep breaths in with
your nose
and out with your mouth
and then in with your nose
and out with your mouth
and with each breath inward
in the center of your forehead and your
third eye
become very quietly centered and see the
light of consciousness
just clear conscious light
and with each exhalation
release all of your concerns and your
limits
your fears and your doubts
and all your stress into the free air
of mother earth and relax
and so it is with each breath inward
we feel ourselves energized
and expanded and awake
and with each exhalation we release
all of our concerns and all our tensions
and the breath of mother earth wash them
away and purifies them
so let us do this in a cycle
with our inner breath we become
energized
through the life force the chi the prana
and our minds are expanded and energized
and as we exhale
we see ourselves becoming calm and
centered
and immersing ourselves into the light
that is infinite pure cosmic mind
now very gently without straining
allow yourself while being aware of your
breath
to gently shift awareness
to the mind watching the breath
and see that you are awake
and this awake mind is infinite
and you can see your own self
and how is that possible except that
this
infinite consciousness is our true self
and thus we may see our individuality
and so without straining let us become
very quiet
in this pure conscious field
and let us see that it is an infinite
ocean
of quiet pure mind
not limited by space or time
but boundless eternal
infinite
being thus aware of the conscious mind
let us begin to sense the space around
us
and if you are with someone
sense that they are awake
and then realize that the awareness
whereby
they are awake and you are awake
is one
there is no separation because in
consciousness
we are all one in spirit
there is one mind shining within all of
us
and this is our true self
and so now in this state
with freedom like a bird led out of a
cage
let us float upward into the space
above our house or wherever we are
located
and allow yourself to see the
countryside or the city
wherever you are
and go upwards into the sky
free and your vision
gazing in all directions at will
and see it as it is right now
and now let us expand further
and go high into the atmosphere
and we see the earth
and in the earth we see there is
seven or eight billion people living
upon her
and as we expand let us go
upward and go out into the atmosphere
and see the entire globe of the earth
earth our mother
and we see that she is also a conscious
being
though not human
and this being our mother earth is awake
and she is female and she is a conscious
living being
and let us feel the unconditional love
earth has for her children
and let us return that to her in full
measure
with a pure and open heart
with infinite love
and while we are in this state of
expanded consciousness
and love let us become aware of father
sky
and as we gaze around the cosmos
we see that the entirety of the universe
is consciousness
manifesting as planets and stars
and civilizations too numerous
to even count
and our minds expand and become one
with that cosmic unbounded being
and it is infinite and boundless
and that is the true nature of the
conscious mind
whereby each of us are awake at this
very instant
and we are at one with that unbounded
being
and now we gaze to the earth
and we put our awareness with our heart
made wide and open and our minds
expanded and relaxed
and we ask that the great being and all
of us
together moving within the oneness
of conscious spirit gaze upon the earth
and humanity with the eye of kindness
and asks that the earth be healed and
humanity
be healed that we be guided to the path
of safety
and enlightenment
and as we do this we see that there are
beings from
other planetary star systems
and we invite them into this meditation
and they are joining us as they merge
their consciousness with ours
and we show them within our mind the
beauty of mother
earth and we ask
them to assist us
as we gaze upon the earth
and send a burst of light from the heart
of the cosmos
that suffuses the entire earth
with consciousness and enlightenment
and infinite love and peace
and as that impulse of light
permeates and suffuses the earth
we see all ignorance vanishing
and the times of the wars ending
and the great illnesses and pandemics
that have swept the earth
will be no more and the wondrous
sciences
and technologies withheld from the
people of the earth
are disclosed and used only for peaceful
and good purposes
and we see the earth in our mind
transformed into the rose garden of
peace
into a time of universal peace
and cosmic awareness
and the earth and humanity begin to take
their place
amongst the other star people the other
planets
as we join in with them
and become a cosmic civilization
and the time of the great changes have
arrived
and the transformation of the earth is
at hand
and so in our hearts and our minds we
know and we see the truth
and we are not afraid because we know
across this chasm of chaos
there will be a civilization foretold
by thousands of seers of the past
which will be a world of enlightenment
of universal
peace of great prosperity
and amazing and wondrous sciences
and so the earth will become the cradle
of the evolution
of enlightened conscious beings who will
then
go forward amongst the stars
to teach those who are coming after us
in a cycle
that never ends that is eternal
and the evolution of intelligent life
in the cosmos
namaste
well i think um did jimmy you&#39;re back
he is that was uh that was calming
uh thank you for that dr greer and i
often say
that in this rushed
life that we live on this planet when we
do a mass meditation like this
right there&#39;s somebody on the other side
of the world
walking down the street busy doing their
thing
and they get a little right and they&#39;ll
feel it
right wow i feel uh i feel what was that
that well that&#39;s how it happens and
people are really affected by that and
i&#39;ll tell you this little brief story
before we end when i was a
first when i was 18 and it was
the fall that i had the contact with the
et&#39;s
on the mountain up in the blue ridge
mountains of north carolina
and um there were these boys who were
kind of drunks well rowdies we call you
know there&#39;s rowdy you know
and we&#39;re living in a dorm but quite a
few kids would get
killed every year driving drunk between
the little town of boone north carolina
and blowing rock where there was a
little two-lane road back then and very
treacherous
and i was meditating one afternoon in my
little cubicle room i had a roommate who
was out at the time
and i saw that they were going to be
killed
and so i said a prayer for their
protection
but that also that they get out of this
phase of just kind of wild
drunken rowdiness and self-destruction
and a few moments later
knock knock knock i opened the door and
it&#39;s these guys
who had been drunk but they were they
appeared stone sober and they said
and they weren&#39;t talking to me i think
they were looking through me to some
higher
and they said please forgive us and
we&#39;re not going to do this anymore
i&#39;m looking around i&#39;m just like a kid
on the floor i&#39;m 18 years old
they never did that again somehow that
me connecting to that larger conscious
self asking for that in a pure-hearted
way
affected them but all all three of them
all together
it was a very very strange early lesson
for me and how
powerful meditation and prayer can be
i want to thank you for this
conversation tonight and for hanging out
with this
for the last couple of weeks for these
live streams it&#39;s
just yeah it&#39;s been absolutely amazing
and as we wind down
i want to thank everybody that is with
us right now but
uh you can continue this live stream
over on the disclosure fest not only
youtube channel but their facebook page
and you go to disclosurefest.org
because coming up next paul ronge
and just like dr greer not only an
influencer and somebody
that is a bringer of knowledge uh for
our community that we&#39;re so thankful for
poor on ghee is the the caliber of
musician
like dr greer is for bringing all of
this
information forward poor angie is next
dr career
thank you so much thank you i appreciate
your uh time and your help and support
and i hope to see you soon again when we
can get
out of our homes we&#39;ll do it out here in
l.a as soon as we can get it set up
thank you so much good one bye-bye
