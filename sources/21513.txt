The Opening Ode
RELIGION IS THE FOUNDATION OF LIFE!
SPIRITUALITY IS THE GROUNDWORK UPON
WHICH THIS TRUE FOUNDATION IS LAID!
We believe firmly in SPIRITUALITY, which deepens
man's Appreciation of GOD and ALL HIS CREATIVE
RELATIONS. However, TRUTH IS GOD! and MAN
is always seeking for Inevitable TRUTH as to his ma
terial and spiritual experiences in his transitory state of
being.
Scientists have uncovered a world of knowledge; yet
who may know the DEPTHS of GOD-KNOWLEDGE?
We speak candidly when we say that man lives mostly
FOR HIMSELF ALONE in the expression of his mental
phase, but he finds this, at best, unsatisfactory —FOR
GOD IS NOT THERE; and to be one with God, Mor
tality endeavors to see His face expressed in their SOUL-
CONSCIOUSNESS, which is the ROOT OF KNOWL
EDGE.
The world in general has long striven for a PERFECT
ANSWER as to WHY HUMANITY IS BORN TO
LIFE, and what IS THE PURPOSE for their passing
through this TRANSITORY STATE OF BEING?
The correct answer to this question cannot be fully
understood by Humanity unless the trend of their lives
has led them to PATHS OF SPIRITUALITY, over
which they consciously or unconsciously have traveled in
the short span of their physical experience.
However, MAN has clamored long ages to Visualize

the TRUE MEANING of THIS PHASE OF LIFE—
searching diligently through all courses of study—curi
ously seeking ways and means by which he may PROVE
that there is a LIFE HEREAFTER.
Yet only those who have studied and concentrated upon
this subject with open minds—and in so doing have de
veloped their Spiritual Senses —can answer the query!
Experience is the perfect teacher! Those outside of this
Experience can but read of others' Experiences and hope
some day to develop them in themselves; when thus de
veloped none will fear "so-called Death," for all will
realize the touch of loved ones' hands who have already
passed onward to the "other side."
CREATIVE SPIRIT LIVES EVERYWHERE, as all
visualize. The forces of God permeate even the air
which man breathes. MIND IS LIMITLESS, because,
as all know, the MIND OF GOD IS LIMITLESS!
Research workers have proven this fact; and if Human
ity are God's Creative Helpers, and reflect HIS CREA
TIVE MIND, is it not correct to believe, that the
CREATIVE MIND OF MAN IS LIMITLESS ALSO
and PERMEATES the Cosmos?
KNOWLEDGE IS THE BUDDING FLOWER OF
SPIRITUALITY, daily opening out into new blooms to
the SUNSHINE OF LIFE and throwing out the fra
grance of Spiritual Consolation to mankind.
And NOW, SPIRITUAL PROGRESS is TOO NO
TICEABLE, nor can it "FAIL TO AWAKEN THE
SOUL" OF ANY MORTALS! who THINK and LIVE
and MOVE and HAVE THEIR BEING under the Care
of God and IN HIS NAME.
According to Natural Law, "like attracts like," and it
is a correct saying, that THINKING GOOD IS THINK
ING GOD! Thinking Evil attracts the Negative Forces

into one's atmosphere so noticeably, that the man who
believes in God, SHUDDERS AT THE TOUCH of
EVIL.
A sensitive world this! In fact the Cosmos may be
Classed as the VIBRATIONAL SYSTEM OF GOD—
Unifying Life in its various relations according with
Humanity's Capacity to Understand Divinity.
The COSMOS—OR BODY OF GOD—is Qualified in
Limitless Space, taking in the infinite heavens as well as
the physical Realities of Life. ALL ARE ONE—and
the Continuity of God's Expression in Heaven and
Earth.
Therefore, their natural instincts have always taught
Mankind, that MIND NEVER DIES and CARRIES ON
its Specific Expression through many various forms of
existence.
The natural laws of God, the Expressions of which are
visible to humanity, TEACH, THAT NOTHING IS
WASTED ! though the physical body returns to dust;
the MIND however, which man knows as his SOUL,
being a PART OF GOD, LIVES ON FOREVER!
Thus the SOUL of man, after its escape from its
physical experience, EXPANDS INTO LIMITLESS
POSSIBILITIES OF INTELLIGENCE: doing things
which it could never accomplish while in physical bond
age.—Is it not reasonable to assume, that when MIND
passes into this INFINITE EXPANSION OF FORCE-
IT IMPROVES with the passing of time?
It is well known, that the CREATIVE SPIRIT OF
MAN Originated before the PHYSICAL Issues Devel
oped; and that it Emerged from the tiny, invisible mole
cules in the waters of the earth and creatively grew up to
the state of being in which man is to-day expressed; and
having passed through these marvelous Expressions of

viii THE OPENING ODE
Progress! IS IT TO BE BELIEVED, that this SPIRIT
OF LIFE ENDS with its poor physical expression?
Nay, dear readers, this is ONLY YOUR BEGINNING
where LOVE is born into your lives, and the best Expres
sions of LOVE are Experienced when the Soul-conscious
ness Outgrows its PHYSICAL NUCLEUS and becomes
like unto the LOVE-SPIRIT of God which permeates all
nature.
Therefore, it must not be thought that our loved ones
vanish though they disappear from our physical view
after leaving their earthly bodies, the God-spark within
them IS ALWAYS HEARD AND FELT! Yet His
Force being invisible, cannot be seen by the physical eye.
Thus is it not a natural trend to Visualize our loved ones
and hear their voices SPEAKING THROUGH OUR
SOULS, silently but forcibly, and FEEL THE NEAR
NESS of their Spiritual bodies?
LOVE, being the DIVINE FORCE OF LIFE, or
FIRST DIVINE THOUGHT attracts GOD'S LOVE
TO US; we therefore, through our LOVE for those
beyond our physical view, attract our loved ones into
our midst, their minds mingling with our minds just as of
yore.
Never in history has there been a time when people of
thinking capacity dwelt so spontaneously upon this sub
ject of CREATIVE AND PERPETUAL SPIRIT; and
the Soul—being the Expression of God—how can it pass
from ken?
Is it not entirely senseless to believe, that our loved
ones lie dormant in the mouldy grave, WHEN ALL OF
LIFE HABITUALLY EXPRESSES USEFULNESS,
PURPOSE and PROGRESS?
Christianity has demonstrated through the Christ, who
was sent DIRECT from God, the Almighty Universal
Spirit, the Father of all, to OVERCOME the pangs of

THE OPENING ODE ix
Pain, Ignorance and Superstition, which are the evil fangs
of Satanic Forces and the tentative Destruction of
MIND, which is God's true and perfect expression of life.
This course has taken many, many years to accom
plish because of various Materialistic Institutions, which
have UNDULY DISCREDITED God's PURPOSE to
bring Humanity to realize the Greatness of HIS PLAN
OF LIFE, and its Purposes. And there is no other
PORTAL TO HEAVEN than through the PORTALS
OF MIND, or Consciousness, which is akin to the MIND
OF GOD. God speaks through man's Intuition of the
perfect way of life.
This Expression of HIS MIND through MAN opens
the door to Knowledge, which the Physical Relation of
MAN cannot disclose.
The Negative Force, which has so destroyed the work
of God before the eyes of MAN, has brought him to the
Realization, that the Negative Force is the DOWN
WARD FORCE leading to Destruction: not the Upward
Course to Knowledge, which turns his gaze to the higher
degrees of thinking and doing, which are now leading
MAN into a New Era of Life, now coming into its own.
And MAN now sings an Opening Ode to the praise of
God in Spiritual tones, instead of singing in the ma
terial music of commonplace life, the coarse-toned song
of Satan. In this "song of praise," Humanity at last find
Consolation; they have also uncovered many infinite
secrets of life in relation to God and Eternity, which
would never have been discovered, had man continued to
sing the material song of Satan.
A new modern searchlight has been thrown upon the
words "CREATIVE SPIRIT"! And through this knowl
edge Humanity have discovered their DUTY IN LIFE:
to Create a Higher Expression of themselves, so that they
might create for themselves the perfect Spiritual Expres

their Intelligent Force among men who are as yet but
climbing the spiritual ladder of progress.
He who believes that the MIND of GOD permeates
ALL NATURE, cannot help but know, that the minds of
those who have passed into Eternity, ALSO PERMEATE
ALL NATURE— being the SPIRIT EXPRESSION of
GOD. Therefore is it not a Consolation to accept the
TRUTH, THAT MIND RETURNS TO EARTH in the
form of your loved ones THROUGH THEIR SPIRIT
UAL FORCE, and Communes with you with loving
words and kindly tones.
The spirit of the Armageddon is BUT THE OPEN
ING UP OF HEAVEN, or the BIRTH OF SPIRITUAL
KNOWLEDGE, which all are finding to be a part of
their natural expression.
Why should the human being believe that heaven's
doors are closed to him when he is BORN with the
DIVINE SPARK of the Creative Spirit WITHIN him?
And in his creation draws to himself various phases of
Spiritual Intelligence, which are but the budding flowers
of the Garden of Eden?
I use this term "Garden of Eden" as a "symbolic ex
pression of the perfect mind of God," when man reaches
the highest state of mentality in his perfect expression of
the highest force of heaven. There is no material Garden
of Eden! This expression throughout God's Great Book
is but Symbolic of the PERFECT CREATIVE MIND
OF GOD. Too long have people thought and believed
along materialistic lines!
God seems mysterious, and HIS messages to Human
ity seem also mysterious. But man has too long neg
lected to go deeper into words which have a hidden
meaning; expressing life only according to their literal

material minded.
But man Intuitively Discovers his Failure to find the
TRUE GOD which the past generations have also sought.
Now within the past ten years mankind have greatly
progressed in uncovering the Secrets of God.
Had life always been as an open book, the mind of man
would have stagnated and progress would have halted.
There is no limit to knowledge, for GOD-MIND IS
LIMITLESS! The earthly expression of life is but one
tiny expression of the experiences of MAN : his Experi
ence in the WORLD TO COME being too Vast for the
physical and material mind to grasp!
However the progress of the past ten years is a suc
cessful start toward bringing God into humanity's daily
expression. And when it is learned, that ETERNITY
IS NOT AFAR BUT IN YOUR MIDST, MAN shall
drop away from his carnal relations of mind, because he
shall come into the Consciousness, that in no other way
can he FEEL THE TREND OF HEAVEN and HEAR
THE ETERNAL VOICE, which COMES ONLY through
the SOUL-VOICE WITHIN HIMSELF: through his
SPIRIT.
Communication in the world passes through and over
invisible waves of ether; and it is accepted as a natural
factor in life to communicate one with another by this
means. Why should this force be used only for earthly
uses?
THIS LIMITLESS INVISIBLE FORCE cannot be
Limited because it is the ETHEREAL FORCE OF GOD.
Therefore it is but natural, that MIND which never dies,
but lives and loves and ever progresses, SHOULD
UTILIZE THE SAME FORCE through which to speak
to their loved ones upon your plane.
There are COUNTLESS MEANS of communication,

pose: and no one with a thinking mind can TRUTH
FULLY DENY THIS POWER OF GOD!
Thought is Spiritual Energy carried by Ethereal Force
no matter in what direction it is sent. Why should the
simple earthly mind believe it has a Corner on this GOD
PRIVILEGE?
The mind of man is narrow and opinionated when he
believes thus; and it is time that he awakens to the fact
that this INFINITE FORCE OF THOUGHT IS GOD'S
OWN and VAST and LIMITLESS.
Close not your eyes, dear fellow readers, to the mes
sages herein! We have lived and loved as do you. Can
you be narrowminded and self-opinionated enough to be
lieve that our Lives and our LOVE ended with so-called
"death," when God and all His forces still live and move?
No! We ARE, and WERE FROM THE BEGINNING
HIS CREATIVE HELPERS.
And thus we, as a Creative Force of God, PERMEATE
your Soul-consciousness and SPEAK to your Intuitive
Minds.
After we have written these various letters, I trust that
humanity will SING the OPENING ODE TO LIFE, and
ACT it Righteously and Spiritually in their every day
expression of God's work.
Life has many "phases of expression." However, the
Source is the all Life-giving, Never-dying, Expressive
MIND OF GOD ! It does not matter how it is expressed
if it reflects the perfect LIGHT OF INTELLIGENCE
and SPIRITUAL UP-BUILDING.

1732-1799
We Are Entering the First Decade of a
New Era
Honor me no more than the Great President of the
United States of your day, ladies: for he, too, is accom
plishing things "unseen and things yet unheard"; and
before his official duties are ended you shall be assured of
safety against War-drums and Cannons, as never before!
For my part, I am delighted to bring a Message to the
world, dear citizens, and to a country that I love best;
for long have I cherished the land of my birth, and now
work especially in the interests of its Spiritual Growth.
Strange as it may seem, for all these decades I have
SPIRITUALLY GUIDED THE HANDS OF THE
MANY PRESIDENTS, and my letter this morning is of
the New Era which this country is entering upon.
Since the artificial chivalry of nations is passing, and
mankind are showing a deeper feeling of true friendship
in practical movement toward the best interests of state
and country, there is arising to the surface a deeper sense
of generating the World Work along the Lines of God's
Plan. There is greater cooperation amongst the Leaders
of the cause for GOOD, in which all are deeply inter
ested.
Looking backward across the fields of past history, the
governing of a state or country seemed a Fixed Status
which no man could revise, and in which the People had
no voice. But thanks to the Wave of SPIRITUALITY

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
in the souls of many who have allowed something besides
Bigotry to come into the enforcement of the World's Gov
ernments, the populace of earth are at last entering into
the First Decade OF THE MILLENNIUM.
I, as a part of the All-seeing Mind of God, have stead
ily watched Evolutionary Progress on your earth, relat
ing to all Issues of Life and its continuity of growth,
and had I, in my temporal life understood the Law of
SPIRITUALITY— or the power of God working through
Nature's Growth in all its ramifications —a fundamental
foundation would have been laid down as a compulsory
law in the beginning of the educational growth of man
kind in the interests of my countrymen, who are to carry
on the laws laid down in the Constitution of the United
States.
A Constitution with a material background, LACKS
THE SPIRITUAL SPARK through which future genera
tions may best benefit in their Mental Growth.
It appears to us, that through man's lacking in Spirit
ual Development, the earth has taken on the smothering
garments of Material Growth to a degree —that GOD
HIMSELF IS NOW UNCLOAKING THE WORLD
TO NAKEDNESS. This phase began at the culmination
of the World War, through which His children suffered
and died and sacrificed, leaving the "mark of the beast"
on His beautiful earth.
And the scars upon its face shall forever burn as a last
ing memorial that WAR IS TRULY HELL! And when
God revolted against the carnal "sins of the beast" work
ing through His children, men began to slowly awaken
to their folly and dastardly shortcomings, and to trend
toward SPIRITUAL GROWTH.
Since the armistice, heads of countries, and factors of
law-making have been endeavoring to form a SPIRIT
UAL GUARD against the repetition of a like crime.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 3
Evil in its worst form is sometimes productive of a
good principle; and perhaps, had it not been for the
World War, SPIRITUALITY, in its perfect expression
might not have been recognized at once, and used in such
practical ways as it is being utilized at this day and time.
But man has too long separated himself as a thing
apart from the "Heavenly Atmosphere": that Power of
God which constitutes His Infinite Action of Perfection.
In this last conflict between GOD and SATAN, human
ity grasped the "straw for safety," and are finding out the
Truth about GOD, AS HE IS !—the INFINITE SPIRIT
UAL BACKGROUND of all Force which through the
Realization of this PERFECT TRUTH, consoles the Soul
of Mankind.
When man fully grasps this new and simple perfect
ideal for living a perfect life on earth, the world to him
will begin to take on new color and new shape, and God,
simple workman that He
is,
will walk along with man on
the earth, hand in hand.
But until the great world conflict, the greater average
of thinking people felt, that they had in some way to
strive to know this True GOD
!
while the thinking minds
have now recognized, that the true GOD-ISSUE IS
A
LIVING GOD WITHIN THEMSELVES, continually
speaking to them.
Hence many have stopped building up
a
fantastic,
tinsel-trimmed God,
a
theatrical impersonation of His
Majesty, at once impracticable and unconstitutional, and
now recognize the Highest Precept of Living Matter,
THIS GOD as being WITHIN THEMSELVES!
And this TRUE GOD
is
now being recognized as
a
Spiritual Foundation for the Laws directing Mankind in
a
"world of material struggle." It
is
an education slowly
conceived; and
it
may take perhaps another generation
before the WORK AND TRUE WORTH OF GOD
is

4 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
Realized, and the world brought into its proper relation
to the Perfect Day coming for mankind thereon.
Strifes and differences may continue; man may engin
eer civil wars and disputes over borderlands, meaning the
sacrifice of the precious lives of God's children, which is
all absolutely due to the ignorant ideals of fleshly leaders
—but these disputes will become less prevalent with the
continued growth of "spiritual education," which will
spread like a contagion throughout the world ! This will
be so much toward the betterment of mankind, that even
the Papistry shall abolish its Idolistic Forms and become
Spiritualized, and merge with other churches into a United
Church for and of GOD. All CHURCHES WILL even
tually UNITE in the same interests and under the same
GOD.
Thus it is that disputes are but stepping-stones to true
knowledge; and the lives that have been sacrificed are
man's PENANCE, under Satan, for accepting his carnal
conceptions of life and carrying them out.
Treaties will not be needed in another generation be
cause of the universal destruction of armaments. A great
Supreme Court of wise and honest leaders chosen from
the religious centers of the world, who magnify and mani
fest the ONE TRUE GOD as their Leader and Example
of the one fundamental Religion, will meet at Geneva, and
there hold consultation at a WORLD INSTITUTE—
through which all mankind will be Spiritual Brothers,
working for GOOD.
All impracticable laws thereto will be destroyed to
gether with other documents of old shady traditions,
superstitions and doctrines. All manifestations —non
essential to man's complete Spiritual Awakening —will no
longer apply to the NEW LIFE, and they shall be ac
counted non-essentials and cast aside with the ashes of
the past.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 5
All of these "yet to be born" Spiritual Realities are now
in their embryo stage of Spiritual Growth and will cul
minate in the improvements of laws which heretofore have
had no Spiritual Lasting Background.
You, as individuals, will live to see Sin slowly diminish;
but unless you, as individuals, have Spiritual Insight and
receptive souls to the higher degree of Understanding,
you may not recognize the great change to come in the
constitution of laws relating to life's standards.
But these laws, like all issues in evolutionary progress,
are invisibly changing for the better, through the en
forcement of higher laws, compelling broader education
to certain standards in "growing youth," which will be
the generation to handle the situation of living expres
sion in the next generation.
Thus, their responsibility in EXPANSION OF THE
SOUL-EXPRESSION for GOD to RULE THE WORLD
will be very great in its Fullest Meaning, it being the
MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE OF ALL LIFE.
The pattern which the individual of to-day formulates
for his son is the starting-point. The higher and the finer
that pattern in mind or soul principles is the better work
of Spiritual Emanation in his "temporal life" that Son
can do, when the time comes to serve in those issues in
his passing days.
THE IMPORTANCE OF LIVING IS VERY
GREAT, my friends: far greater than any human mind
can conceive.
Thanks be that such men as President Hoover and
Premier MacDonald are given to the world through the

spiritual era" arising in this decade. —And GEORGE
WASHINGTON is still at the HEAD OF HIS POST
as he has ever been !
Never believe, dear friends, that when a president
passes away from his chair that he loses interest in the
Jurisdiction and Direction of his country. SILENTLY
and FIRMLY, through the minds of thinkers of high
standards, We, the Heavenly Hosts, direct the PER
FECT THOUGHT to Mankind, for Mortality to REAL
IZE THEIR COORDINATION with that INVISIBLE
REALM in which we aspire most heartily FOR GOD'S
PLAN on earth.
As a nation, America is, at the moment, supreme, be
cause of her wide scope of Christian fellowship even in
the making of
a
commercial world. She bears
a
mark of
Leadership,
a
natural heritage from her mother coun
try, Great Britain.
Great Britain has little room for expansion, lacking
freedom of space; but America's vastness indicates her
unlimited possibilities to come. And
it
is
imminent that
America shall be the CENTRAL EMANATING POINT
OF SPIRITUAL LAW THROUGH ALL MANKIND!
And man must have this supremacy of true natural ex
pression, that he may find the true answer to life's
meaning.
There
is
one dangerous pitfall ahead in which America
can destroy her moral principle, and that
is
the "Mark
of the Beast" upon her brow in her seemingly ungovern
able vices, rampant in the cosmopolitan undertow of her
underworld.
These are the DEMONS OF HELL dragging man
kind's Principles DOWN TO DESTRUCTION through
FOREIGN DISOBEDIENCE and DISREGARD and
DISRESPECT toward the CONSTITUTION OF THE
UNITED STATES.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 7
VICE is your darkest dragon, consuming virtues in
three outstanding branches of immorality: ALCOHOL,
DRUGS and SEX EVILS, which no church has so far
reached and farcical law-executors largely encourage for
GRAFT.
These underworld crime instigators are responsible for
the downfall of America's Citizenship in its true Ameri
can light. And until SPIRITUALITY penetrates with
its "bright healing light" into these festering corners and
crannies of earth—there shall remain the mark of shame
upon the Brow of the Goddess of Liberty.
These prevailing conditions cannot be diminished until
they are demolished forever THROUGH ENFORCE
MENT by honorable officials of an AMERICAN DE
GREE OF MIND, the highest in the educational de
grees in our country, and not by foreign illiterates:
Through agreements of governments to establish and
finance educational centers, giving all individuals an
equal chance for knowledge, and making this enforce
ment compulsory to suitable age; by establishing recrea
tion for men whereby they may enjoy a wholesome at
mosphere; and creating an establishment of labor for
all classes, whereby idle lands may be cultivated and men
given useful work to do, instead of crowding into slums
of cities, this problem will be solved.
The slums of your cities are the Hell-Holes of Satan
in man's temporal growth, and must be abolished from
the face of the earth, that the higher and better thinking
possibilities of God's Plan for His children can be estab
lished.
To improve the United States of America, she can
build more and better roads, open up the pioneer lands
and districts, using hoarded moneys in her treasuries for
improvement and the enlightenment of mankind. This

will be a Building Up of God's TRUE PLAN FOR SPIR
ITUALITY, in which the second coming of the Christ
shall be Realized in the UNIVERSALITY OF the PER
FECT MIND.
If the governments of the different countries would
improve their constitutions by placing their common
wealths upon a higher pinnacle of thought and progress,
Mentally and Physically, there would be no occasion for
mortal revolutions and civil misunderstandings.
The formulating of the true GOD-LAW on earth lies
with those responsible for governments! The common
wealths, under the thumbs of politicians and rulers, are
not at present in position to accomplish much of good.
Under the present systems they can but abide with the
evil conditions that prevail; and out of this carnal debris
chose according to their best CONSCIENCE the things
which befit their temporal growth and express their lives
according to these limitations.
A great SPIRITUAL WAVE is sweeping the earth:
but it cannot be expressed in its DIVINE Sense, with the
true presence of the TRUE GOD WORKING THERE
IN, until there is more Leniency toward the Acknowl
edgment Of SPIRIT IN ALL THINGS; and a truly
DIVINE Sense in the Seats of all Governments of what
ever sort—which Constitute Laws for man's welfare.
There is too much assumption of right and power by
the unworthy, which constitutes poorly balanced present
ruling, and does not justify God's Plan of true Spiritual
Emanation throughout all of life's principles.
So again, as other spiritual visitors have also, pleaded,
I ask, that humanity especially concentrate and reflect
their lives on the BASIS OF BROTHERLY LOVE: for
Just LOVE is the greatest applied principle in the world,
and CULMINATES IN UNITY OF MIND, no matter
of what application.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 9
We are all God's Children, living absolutely in ONE
NESS WITH HIM in the CYCLING VIBRATION OF
UNIVERSAL MIND. God's Radio receives all thoughts
of His children. So man must cease to concentrate upon
what seem superior material possessions, and dwell more
upon the God-thought in all things and the REALITY of
SPIRITUAL CONTINUITY OF THOUGHT, and
LIFE, expressed in the Highest Divine Sense!
Until each individual adopts this wholesome CON
STITUTION for himself and governs himself by it in
his every-day expression, mankind shall go on groping
and misunderstanding the fundamental principles of
God's Plan, and misguide itself.
We, as spiritual crusaders for Christ, with the Saviour
of mankind at the head, are working for and with you.
And I myself, still proudly the Father of my Country,
am overlooking ALL THINGS. We, together, plead for
Honesty and Equality of Spiritual Thought and Action
on your part.
All happiness is governed by utilizing the physical ener
gies in the CAUSE OF UPBUILDING, and no tearing
down and destructive effects of Satanic power being per
mitted by mankind.
The presidents and kings of different countries and
their cabinets should prepare to accept the revised stand
ards of the urging SPIRITUAL WORLD behind them;
and they shall in the next decade realize the Importance
of this demand upon their powers and integrity.
They should begin to revise their laws so to make the
commonwealths "living systems" more honest and God
like, in the name of SPIRITUALITY and PROGRESS.

prove to be Monuments to your God.
The mechanical age has pushed some individuals out
of their work, and they fancy that conditions lead them to
crimes, thus filling prisons and insane asylums, until con
ditions are a disgrace in the face of civilization.
These conditions could have been avoided if men had
had the foresight of the Spiritual Progress and the Im
provement in social and economic conditions of their
day. Setting limitations, and finding no places for these
limitations to fit or prosper, has cost the tax-payer more
misplaced money, than if this money had been placed
toward building up of other progressions, whereby idle
ness could have been readjusted.
IDLENESS BREEDS MISCHIEF! and mischief
breeds contempt for law and order. This is due to mis
conceptions of Spiritual Principleships in the making of
laws of inequality in which God-expression is lacking.
Let us, dear readers, clamor loudly for "Higher Prin
ciples" to build up Higher Morals in social and economic
laws of all jurisdictions.
I have little to add regarding my own presidential
jurisdiction while in my temporal form: but I may say
as a truth, that I endeavored to live and reflect the
HIGHER LIFE as far as my education allowed me to
function.
Therefore, one may plainly understand, that the
HIGHER THE CURRICULUM OF EDUCATION,
the higher will be the personal precept of life and the
wider its Vision and Spiritual Progressive Force.

the dastardly holocaust of 1914-1918, whereby the con
sciousness of mankind was awakened to mortality's lack
of proper dominion of righteous spirit, or that SOUL-
SPARK OF TRUTH and HARMONY and PERFEC
TION, WHICH IS GOD, living in every man's bosom.
Such men as your presidents have been, Roosevelt,
Wilson, Harding, Coolidge and Hoover, are the Insti

Goddess of Liberty will be proud to stand at her portal
and POINT A FINGER HEAVENWARD.
How I would like to give you something of more sub
stantial proof of my ACTUAL PRESENCE here, before
closing this letter: but there is little that I could say but
what is already recorded in the books of time. None of
my compatriots remain; all are "over here" In The Fields
Of Eternal Progress.
Mary, my mother, and Martha, my wife, are still my
close associates, although the word "wife" has no mean
ing in Eternity, for marriage is earth-made in its temporal
sense. But LOVE draws us together, through its Ethereal
Force in a magnetic sense. We just seem to be of one
mind and one in soul.
Thanks be that there is no more physical consternation
of settling up family affairs and material burdens. Life
is so much loftier; and the thought of one's mind being
in Spiritual Growth with God—the physical chrysalis
being shed away—allows the mind to reflect at its best.
We know no sorrow nor pain, no disappointments nor

MAND EACH INDIVIDUAL TO DO GOD'S WORK
WELL while so entrusted with it in his short temporal
life.
GEORGE WASHINGTON.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN
1809-1865
My Plea for Universal Love
Delighted I am, my mortal friends. The spirit of me
is proud to convey a message in fulfilment of God's Plan.
May the leaflets upon which my voice again is heard be
A MONUMENT, constantly renewed, in the space of
future days to come.
And may the readers of "Letters from Eternity" Not
be Cynical, but know THAT MIND GOES ON from
earth, and LIVES FOREVER, ever gaining in strength,
and continuity and force, with all its worth of a lifetime,
and acquiring experiences in Eternity. The MIND is
built upon the Rock of Ages of God, whereby Intellect
seeth and knoweth all things.
I come to silently dictate through the psychic forces
(the mediums) this "plea for unity" to all mankind. I
find it quite natural to take up a subject which interested
me most while in my temporal body: for is not LOVE
the greatest thing in the world?
Yea! And it is even greater in Eternity; for added
knowledge grasps even a higher meaning of this word,
when one may visualize themselves the force which con
stitutes pure unconditioned LOVE. And here, one in no
way has a desire to abuse this force, knowing that it is a
Spiritual Part of God Himself.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 13
My message to mankind is especially to give this
definite reason, why mankind should not abuse the forces
of love emotions of any sort: for by doing this dastardly
thing they are abusing the personal moods and feelings
of Deity.
Were God visualized before you in the form of one
of His divine beings, would you intentionally hurt or
crush a soul—or bring one spark of unhappiness into the
Life of Deity?
Place yourself in the light of the highest force imag
inable, and reason with yourself: would it be pleasing
to your soul to know that the world was all against you
in the enforcement of your rightful, finer, principles,
which go to make up the Harmony and Perfection of the
world?
Kindred ones, live not the reflection of hypocrisy, for
in your inner souls, in the light of any issue, you secretly
bear the truth that you desire to treat all issues sur
rounding you as you would desire to be done by; for
all souls cry for justice and perfection and harmony.
This is the natural trend of every soul, for it is the
God-part of every individual. To realize this fully re
quires the higher knowledge; and higher knowledge is
the answer to God's greatest demand, good citizenship!
and the basis of good citizenship is the adage: "Love one
another."
The Higher the intellectual principle in humanity, THE
WIDER the SPIRITUAL VISION which dominates over
physical causes and effects.
Education is GOD and PROGRESS. Ignorance is
Satan's stagnating pool of superstition and greed. Like
the pools of pestilence, this must be destroyed by the
cleansing powers of superior intelligence, and the disin
fectants of faith, and belief in the higher expression of
life while in the temporal state.

14 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
He who is satisfied with the commonplace emanations
of life—is a slave to his own implanted negative forces,
which hold him captive from the light of life. There
must be a strong desire in every human breast to "know
more," and to know it "well," so that God's fountain-
head of eternal youth in progressive knowledge be prev
alent in the minds and hearts of "so-called Civilizations."
To a certain extent this desire is prevalent, but it is
poorly analyzed or understood; for man's material am
bitions may progress far faster than his aspiration to ex
press spiritual and creative progress in his economic and
social standards of life. In other words, the world is
steadily creating for itself a commercial and material
world of gods, instead of looking upward in gratitude
to the SPIRITUAL GOD who gives to "all" freedom of
spirit, and contentment of the soul.
And the greater the glitter and adornment of the com
mercial world, the more material stress it lays upon the
workers of the world, who are instrumental in building
up the "spiritual gods" which voice the higher civiliza
tions of this day and time.
The TRUE GOD is no partial respecter of persons,
but uses ABSOLUTE EQUALITY—Physically, Men
tally and Spiritually alike for all His children.
Do not consider this to be a socialistic lecture, from the
voice of an anarchist. God forbid ! for anarchists are only
tools of destruction in the light of the finer senses of reali
zation.
But EQUALITY amongst men, which God demands,
is made by LOVE and respect for the finer feelings of
those less fortunate than others, whereby through the im
provements of kingdoms, governmental standards may
take the sting from poverty by creating surroundings,
where the stagnant pools of malice and greed may be de

stroyed, and the unenterprising minds of the habitually
poverty-stricken may be enlightened.
UNIVERSAL LOVE would destroy the commercial
gods of politics, also of some religions of the time, and the
love of moneyed power which reigns among all classes at
the present time.
These organized forces, governed through the powers
of mammon, dominating mankind, talk of progress, of
beautifying the world, cutting down the hours of labor
and reflect many improvements; but are not succeeding
in taking the overburden from poverty, whereby this sort
of unnecessary slavery may be relieved.
This must be done that GOD MAY BE REALIZED
and the heads of these organizations be kept from being
over-stuffed.
The greater majority of "so-called civilizations" cannot
be censured for passing into oblivion, or into a spiritual
transitory state of expression uninformed of their proper
Duty. This is caused by the conditions under which hu
manity have been forced to express their temporal lives:
and this has wrought such a condition as of a PERMA
NENT HELL, where the CONSCIOUSNESS of man suf
fers for his sins in self-torture and degradation.
In my time there was supposed to be a material place
called Hell, because no one knew the truth. Material
laws, strapping man down to material circumstances, pre
vented higher studies; and he correspondingly accepted
the material truths such as he could grasp, from the
imaginary light of his forefathers, who had suffered even
a worse Hell upon earth.
But to-day Hell is known as both Theory and Truth!

from this picture of brimstone and fire which was so real
to our forefathers.
And Hell is not "real in a material sense," but it is
"real in a spiritual sense," even unto to-day: for the
culprit does suffer the pangs of spiritual fire and brim
stone in the EMOTIONS OF HIS TELL-TALE CON
SCIENCE in lasting suffering, or sorrow and regrets for
any Disobedience of the Laws of the Perfect Command
ments of Deity.
Hell is not a place where the culprit must remain for
ever: for God forgives, even at the eleventh hour re
pentance. The Good Book tells you so. And he who
having disobeyed the natural laws of life, —through his
Desire to REPENT—may work his way Upward out of
this mire of confusion and mental misconceptions, and
advance Spiritually to a "higher realm of realization,"
from which he is born again on earth, a better man, and a
better citizen: reflecting a higher cause in his newer life.
If a man reflects a perfect conscience and a perfect
attitude in his temporal life, this is not a reason to as
sume that he has not been otherwise: if he could look
back into his own various Reincarnations he would find
that he could have improved himself mentally even
through the stumbling blocks of his various former ex
periences.
Through every mistake, by the "magnificent organiza
tion" which prevails in Eternity, every error of mankind
is finally turned Into an awakening toward Improvement.
It is a natural law of life, that each "era of evolution,"
through GOD'S PLAN, brings with it a newer and more
beautiful Reflection of Life, and man proves this to him
self by his searching back through the records of time,
and seeing the Evolution of Nature since the Beginning

back in the animal stage of mankind. LOVE was then
replaced by Jealousy and the force of Fear. But these
two phases with the ages, are slowly passing from sight,
because they were not expressive of the "highest perfec
tion of form," to which all things of creation trend.
In this day and time of higher intellect and studious
manifestation, the world is woefully in want of the higher
state of LOVE-EMANATION, whereby the true God
may reign successfully amongst His children.
And this can only be magnified into an "Experience of
Paradise on earth," by the commonwealths choosing UN-
CORRUPT LAW-MAKERS and EXECUTORS of their
religious and political regimes —Leaders, whose first
vision is God's Laws, and the spiritual trend of all issues,
forever magnifying the first and only simple, honest
LAW-MAKER— GOD—AS HE IS.
These temporal leaders must be fearless in the face of
antagonists: each knowing that he is following God's
Plan; that God has the RIGHT WAY, and that RIGHT
is MIGHT!
And he who formulates, or executes a ruling law, must
be endowed with the endorsement of coordination and
cooperation of all the "highest spiritual institutions of
the world," wherein JUSTICE and PEACE are the high
est and noblest symbols.
No more war-clouds will hover over God's domain
when Mind reaches the highest pinnacle of Spiritual de
velopment: but Mind will not reach this highest pinnacle
of development, until the value of Mammon has depre
ciated from man's viewpoint, and put away from the
honest physical senses.

principles of various organizations —must rule over the

1 8 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
FINALLY ACCOMPLISHED in your war-tired world.
For CHRIST, the King of Salvation, is reaching to
earth IN THE NAME OF SPIRITUALITY! He is
again born to earth, but receiving little attention, just as
when He first entered into the material temple among
the money changers.
Yet His influence permeated all life, and largely "re
created" the political and economic atmosphere of that
time. And again His Influence is greatly coming to light
in this NEW SPIRITUAL CAMPAIGN, through the
divine inspiration of those who are being elected as heads
of governments and countries; and through the inspira
tion of Christian Teachings and the Denunciation of Evil
amongst men.
Thus men are gradually visualising the fallacy of their
horrible bloodshed and human and mental sacrifices.
And in Christ's inspirational mingling right amongst man
kind of this age, His VOICE SHALL BE RECOGNIZED
again in the spirit of true creative minds, which are up
building the "temples of time" into a perfect picture of
TRUE GOD-FORCE which is endeavoring to rule all
things, In the name of LOVE.
The commercial god may be a thing of show and
grandeur and beauty to man—a creature of majesty in
appearance, but he has no place upon his bosom for the
world-weary man to rest, who has believed that he must
delve only for this exacting commercial god, which he
forces himself to do in this age and time.
But he will not know the TRUE GOD, which he faintly
endeavors to understand, until he works out his SALVA
TION in the light of God's Plan and labors for Progress;
and this TRUE GOD shall only be visualised in his next
life to come.
What an impugnment upon the TRUE GOD OF
EARTH, who sees all, and is with you alway!

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 19
Even hard labor is a delight when the laborer is con
scious of the interest and immanence of the TRUE GOD
at his side, working hand in hand with him within his
Soul-Thought, formulating his daily expression in helping
him to build up God's monuments of time for his progress
upon the earth plane.
The poignant difficulty among workers of to-day, and
those in close touch with the physical surroundings of
earth
is,
that they have not caught the spark of "crea
tive spiritual realization" in the trend of their daily
thought. Therefore the greater mass of population bear
a drab outlook upon life, when the responsibility lies in
each individual, because he does not carry on his daily
life expression in the highest spiritual creative spirit.
This LACK OF ENTHUSIASM for SPIRITUAL
PROGRESS in all issues has resulted in
a
hard com
mercial grind and
a
material nucleus for mankind out of
which man appears to be unable to untangle himself, and
he blames GOD, the ALMIGHTY GIVER of GOOD, for
his own manceuvers.
But this condition
is
prevalent upon earth because man
himself has failed through his mind channels, to keep his
SPIRITUAL IDEALS from being trampled underfoot.
All the Spiritual Forces of Eternity appeal to the non-
thinkers of the world to express the desire for
a
"higher
intellectuality for God," which will reflect TRUE
SPIRITUALITY, AND TRUE DOMINION OF PRIN
CIPLES OVER EVIL, which will enable God to reign
upon earth in His perfect and righteous reflection, now
smothered by Satan's stronger force.
Man has too long appropriated the reign of providence,
thrusting the warhorses of evil powers into the beautiful
fields of God in battles, leading men into a chaos of

living and out-manoeuvering these Satanic forces, and is
gradually inspiring thinking men to lead the masses into
the fields of right and decent living.
But there will be a fallacy in higher education, if those
involved in it seek to find that Inspiration to come through
Materialistic Ideals, instead of giving credit to its REAL
SOURCE, or GOD. And this is not as important an
issue even as seeking to find and know the finer points
of the GOD-MIND.
When these finer issues and principles of the God-
mind are reflected in the human mind, the human reflec
tion will voice an entirely different goal than that which
it first aspired for. But the student must heed the danger
of hurrying through his curriculum, grasping only the
material facts and figures, lest he lose hold on the great
est issue in life, the SPIRITUAL HEIGHT OF IN
TELLECTUAL EXPRESSION of himself, which should
be every man's goal.—In short, he must SEE GOD IN
ALL HIS WORKS!
When bereft of Spiritual Expression, the individual is
extremely unpopular. He becomes but a hardened factor

thinkers"—awaking them to their opportunities whereby
they may also emanate creative virtues.
The world had not the standard of beauty in my day
that prevails to-day. Too many men hid behind the walls
of monasteries and prayed, while havoc and disaster
emanated unmolested in civilized and uncivilized corners
of mother earth.
But he who attends to the spiritual peace of God on
earth to-day, has a wider field than the narrow ideals
of past religious history. Therefore it is hopeful to be
lieve that your lands will never again suffer the equal of
past ravages of evils and warfares.
There is but one great factor to be more fully mag
nified in man's ideals of life-reflection, and that is LOVE
IN ITS SPIRITUAL SENSE! Not the sort of LOVE
uppermost in the emanence of mankind in this day and
time, where LOVE is measured very largely by one's
social standing, money, or political power.
But Humanity must aspire to attain a Self-respect,
wherein they may respect and revere their brethren re
gardless of caste or color, regardless of station or stand
ard: just a clean, sweet, wholesome regard in God's name.
For are we not all Children of GOD in whose generous
LOVE we abound, and endeavor to Express Him?
And he who can uphold Faith and Devoutness in the
SPIRIT OF THINGS UNSEEN, and YET TO COME,
in the "face of any disaster" is Inspired as a Co-worker
with the Almighty Spirit Force to build up into its Sig
nificant Meaning the Word—LOVE!
For he who aspires for God also aspires for mankind
in the upbuilding of the DIVINE UNIVERSE through
decorous thought and action. And the highest degree of
this "thought realization" is the development in human
nature of the Fourth Dimension of Mind, wherein through
VIBRATION GOD AND MAN DWELL AS ONE.

22 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
Now before concluding my letter I would like to state
to all my friends, that each individual has an allotted
work to do while on earth : and until that allotted work is
completed he must return again and again in REIN
CARNATED FORCE through the "temporal bodily
form," and continue the work he is to accomplish—as
designed by nature.
When that allotted work is completed, man advances
to a Higher Sphere of Material and Spiritual Evolution,
evoluting in the Cycles of the Life Expression preemi
nent in whatever plane or earth. And may I say, that my
work accomplished while upon your earth sphere WAS
COMPLETED, for I have not again returned in the body
of another in my form—at least not on your sphere.
But I have the pleasure of expressing life in a Higher
Spiritual and Material Planet which you name Uranus.
However, this Spiritual Mind of Abraham Lincoln is
LIMITLESS in its Expansion of Growth and Expression.
And may I make it clear to the reading public that
wherever past interests have centered in Past Reincarna
tions, that SPIRIT never forgets its past reincarnations
and is free to Inspire and Love, as of yore. So, naturally,
I have been much interested in past history which very
much interested me while on your earth, and in all Ma
terial Progress along that line, which I watch and study
carefully.
So it seems as if I were still a part or expression in
the higher emanations of your life on your earth, not so
much through desire, but through the NATURAL
EMANATION OF UNIVERSAL MIND POWER, or
the VIBRATION of SPIRITUAL LAW, WHICH SEES
ALL THINGS.
Like the great God-mind of Creation, the Great God-
Mind of Spiritual Upbuilding, WE SEE ALL and KNOW
ALL things of worth and Upbuilding for Progress. And,

as we have ofttimes said before, being a Counterpart of
Deity—it is our Natural Expression to Silently and In
visibly DWELL AMONGST YOU in all things of Good
and Perfection. Of the evil machinations of Satan we
have no part, or control, and act only through good
promptings which are often inefficient.
I do hope this will be consoling to those of my friends
who fear to lose their loved ones lest they see them no
more.
And again, since we have more time, I desire to give
a description of my experience in passing through so-
called "death," for I know it will be a consolation to
thousands:
After the shock of my first experience I felt but a
faintness and a lightness of body as if I had been wafted
gently away by the wind. Then a deep sleep seemed to
have taken possession of me for a time. I never yet have
fathomed how long I remained in that condition. Then it
seemed as if I had been soundly asleep and suddenly
awakened in an entirely new surrounding.
What had taken place during that coma I knew not,
and had no desire to know. I only knew that I had passed
through the Change, and was Satisfied that my Work
upon the Earth-plane was Finished. I found myself
eager to visit my new surroundings, sheltered by the fond
consolations of a horde of loved ones who greeted me
until life seemed as a "welcome home old-time social
affair."
There was no grief in my soul that I had left my loved
ones of earth; and no revenge in my heart toward him
who had so suddenly destroyed my physical body.
And may I say that this man Booth has since Apolo
gized to Me for causing my untimely departure from the
earth. For this outrage upon earth he has paid the full

expresses life in a better degree.
In my Ethereal Growth I have met many noted per
sonages who, like myself, were dazed and amazed over
the surroundings, and experiences so different from any
earthly concept of the Hereafter. The steps of progress
have to be learned until we become accustomed to our
places in this Ethereal Sphere.
There has never been a desire to be back in the old
physical body mentioned by any one in my hearing: nor
had I ever this desire. It seemed as if our aim had been
TO DEVELOP INTELLECT, which is in truth, still our
goal.
It is far more delightful to be composed of ETHE
REAL FORM and MIND VIBRATION, than it is to be
composed of "material solids" which hamper the Spiritual
Expression —which cannot flourish properly because of
the mechanical hampering growth dragging down the
spirit.
Getting away from your "mechanical age" of mind-
growth, gives us a wider outlook, which no human con
cept could quite understand were I to attempt to explain
it.
The freedom of this God-expression in the Spirit is
never fully understood, until one passes into this ethe
real form; where Spiritual Growth best expresses itself
in SPIRITUAL LOVE EMANATION TO ALL NA
TURE: LOVE, in its highest degree being that LOVE
which I felt for Ann Rutledge, my sweetheart of youth —
A LOVE DIVINE which always Reflected GOD to my
life.
This LOVE was not to be mine on earth. I later
learned the reason: because it would have deflected me
from being forceful in a time of my country's need. Thus

pleted, we might dwell in implicit LOVE with God; and
in our souls, truly mated, lies the Definition of PURE
LOVE.
Not in any way as man and wife, or lovers, for there
is no marriage in Eternity. There is no need, for souls
dwell all as one in Heaven, representing the LOVE OF
GOD FOR ALL. When the human mortal mind can
place LOVE upon that Pedestal whereby DEITY IS
FELT, IT IS LOVE INDEED !
Thus, my children of earth, create for yourselves the
Atmosphere of Deity in your general reflection, and you
will draw to yourselves your Natural Love-attractions:
and in no other way is earthly matrimony a success.

is nothing to hinder Him. He was human just as I was
upon your earth. What reason is there to believe that
he could not reach your portal in personal spirit as well
as any creative spirit through the mind emanation?
FAITH IS THE MAGNET OF ETERNITY! So
have FAITH: out of which the Highest Vibrations are
attracted through the medium of human belief. And
may I state that this "Spiritual Communication" will
gradually become more pronounced in future. Like at
tracts like in the infinite sources of realization, so why
should not MIND ATTRACT MIND ? This is an estab
lished fact and will develop slowly as did the earthly
radio.
Already that portion of humanity, which assiduously
use their thinking abilities, consciously realize that MIND
ATTRACTS MIND,— SEEN OR UNSEEN, because
they fathom that MIND IS UNIVERSAL. The Pul
sating Vibrations are really God: the BREATH OF LIFE
THAT PERMEATES ALL!
Science is the factor through which this truth is being
more openly shown; and if the minds of the influential
people of your domain would accept practical facts upon
which to build up their fundamental principles of ex
pression, there would be no more delay regarding this
way of communication. They could easily prove the
TRUTH OF SPIRITUALISM in its rightful relation
to the world as the FOUNDATION OF ALL RE
LIGIONS!
But no! Mortality have attempted every other means
to prove the "highest light of intelligence," feeling that
they must have some more tangible source with which
to convince the critic; and they have built up ways and

know just where to place their confidence.
The whole SUM AND SUBSTANCE OF SPIRIT
UALISM IS BUT A NATURAL LAW, working through
the sixth and seventh senses of mankind, in just the same
relation as the other senses function. When mortality
comprehend this truth, they will begin to see the LIGHT
OF THE TRUE DAY.
CARNAL STUPIDITY IS THE CURSE OF ANY
CIVILIZATION, deterring the soul expression of life and
is only a Natural Law, but which carnal forces have
crushed under foot. But this LAW OF PSYCHIC SCI
ENCE must predominate in the MIND ere long—other
wise Humanity will plod along, blundering and scarring
their souls with the Unrealities wrought through the evil
forces of carnality.
Man endeavors to harness the Negative Forces and to
put them to practical uses, and this unnatural siege upon
nature, brings carnal disasters upon the living issues of
life. So why not change this attitude of spirit, which has
grown up as a part of man's being, to the opposite power,
by harnessing and using the Affirmative Forces of Nature
for one's temporal development—Spiritually and Physi
cally?
And the solution is to have the CHRIST MIND! If
Mortality would reflect daily life according to the simple,
natural, placid and beautiful Moods of Deity, obeying
the instincts of infinite nature's callings, instead of the
callings of the physical nature, they would unconsciously
create this Christ-like Reflection of Action, whereby no
man would have a Corner on GENIUS or a Corner on

economic Equals.
Some may say that life would not be interesting should
this phase be apparent in every man's every-day living
experience, because there would be no race to run for
Supremacy and no Excitement to stir the soul of the
carnal being; but where is the glory in a struggle for
Supremacy, except in the Struggle for Supremacy WITH
GOD—the BEING ONE IN UNISON with the great
Creative Mind over all things?
There is no higher station than the Endeavor to have
an Illuminated Conscience of Ethereal Intelligence, which
few men have divined in this day and time. The average
man believes his Conscience to be an average practical
reflection! but this is because his Consciousness is over
stuffed with "material scientific data" relating to the
world's works.
But that is not all that is required in the true reflection
of the minds of earthly concept. Humanity must come
to the Realization of a HIGHER DEGREE of their HU
MAN MIND, which is only the temporal organization for
higher education along material scientific and economic
lines. These subjects are essential to man's temporal
growth and are greatly needed, and most practical in de
veloping progress of a material nature; yet there must be
an even higher ATTITUDE OF MIND in man! and that
is the REALIZATION OF A SPIRITUAL FORCE, or
the Sixth and Seventh physical Senses, wherein man real
izes the Glorification of his achievements, and leaves a
"lasting impression" upon the sands of time—through this
INFINITE EXPRESSION!— this INFINITE EX
PRESSION being Instrumental in the world's Higher

OUTSIDE OF HIMSELF! I had this inkling of
thought, for otherwise the practical use of that IN
FINITE FORCE would never have come to my hand in
the Experiment of, say, the kite and the key.
Electricity is the most essential factor in God's expres
sion of to-day, perhaps demonstrated through that one
illustration. Let no man believe, that Electricity is not
essential to the building up of practical thought force
in mankind, for Humanity is built of this Self-same
Invisible Substance, over which the fleshy form is super
imposed. And God has created this Structure of Hu
manity, to express this electrified thought of God in mor
tal action.
Mortality is but one phase of this "HIGHER
THOUGHT-PERSONALITY OF GOD," there being
countless phases which are invisible to the human optics.
This is because the human structure has not yet pro
gressed away from its physical growth sufficiently to Vis
ualize the UNSEEN FORCES which are YET TO BE A
PART of the human kingdom !
And these UNSEEN FORCES can only be attracted
and put to practical use by mankind by means of the
knowledge, which they are gradually taking on through
nature's mysterious ways. This SPIRITUAL GROWTH
IS A PART OF GOD'S NATURAL EXPRESSION and
MANIFESTATION IN HIS EVERY-DAY PROGRES
SION, AND IS NOW COMING TO LIGHT!
And this is only in accord with all things of nature
before the mortal sight of man that have developed new
phases, such as the natural development of the physical
temple of man, or the body which houses the Ego, or
God's spark of life in him. Thus the physical body has
gradually become a thing more and more beautiful.

up and onward to the human kingdom. So at this time
man is passing through another "phase of transition,"
Inwardly and Outwardly, to a new Organization of Ex
pression In the Spirit. This is so decidedly apparent,
that in another century man will fully realize the truth
of this statement.
At this time mankind may think there is nothing to
show outwardly that this phase is coming to pass, yet
seeing the Temporal Advancement as I visualize it in my
spiritual experience, I challenge the world to deny this
fact: that man will not recognize himself in another cen
tury, should he still be in the temporal form of earth.
We, as SPIRIT FORCE—look on your Creative Ex
pression—as a Phase far Advanced to our Expression
while living in the body in our temporal state of being.
And Intellect shall never halt in its Expression, but shall
forever flourish and expand into the GOD-MIND as it
was intended to do . . . and there is no LIMITATION
to this GOD-MIND!
Turning to the most important factor of humanity's
natural expression at the present time, WE OVER HERE
have joined hands in a Crusade to spread amongst in
fluential thinkers of your earth the Desire to put down
the curse of bigoted and narrow laws, which are bonds
of slavery, and strait-jackets and withhold natural ex

rightfully on these non-essential, opinionated, man-made
laws and dogmas, which persist with their limitations.

of your material earth for MUTUAL UNITY amongst
mankind in regard to the system of governing countries

highest pinnacle of force: and through this Force of
Mammon the commonwealths have no influence. There
must be less value placed upon material concepts of
Supremacy in the principles of temporal life, and more
Value put upon the EXPRESSION OF DIVINITY as
being the WHOLE PRINCIPLE.
It is because DIVINITY has been taken out of politics,
that this condition rules the world. However we would
not want the old Orthodox Religions mixed up in the
light of Politics! Nay! God forbid! It was largely
because of this condition that the Colonies fought to deny
that right of action.
Why? Because a Narrow Opinionated Religion
HELD BACK their Spiritual Progress and Growth.
But I speak of a religious principle that is not a
Religion, but a NATURAL HOLY EXPRESSION
OF NATURE, which God intended to be uppermost in
the lives of all temporal beings. If mankind had not
forced the law of individual trends in the names of
Denominations, RELIGION would not have become nar
row and bigoted: but, being so, it was necessary to crush
it out of politics.
He who makes a LAW, without the LIGHT OF GOD'S
SIMPLE HONEST NATURE BEHIND IT, makes only
a carnal law for human life: and it is the full intention
of the HIGHER THINKERS OF ETERNITY to CRE
ATE within the present wisdom of man the desire for
Spiritual, Progressive Principles in the laws.
In other words, to create laws that in Reality follow
GOD'S DESIRES, for He is now asking man to do this,
as He is fully capable of doing—seeing all.

man intentionally plans to be a walking material robot.
Now before closing, may I relate just a little phase of
consolation to those who know not whether they fit a
round or square hole in the checkerboard of life?
My parents thought me impossible! Mother would
have liked to make a preacher of me. Father wanted to
ship me to sea. I favored neither. So James adopted me
as a printer's devil, and a good devil I was in searching
for creative material through which to Express that hidden
SOMETHING secreted away from the optics of my
associates.
I tried to find my "calling" in that dingy printer's
establishment; but James' arbitrary nature and mind
and mine did not fit. Brothers by birth we were, but not
affinities by nature, for each individual mind-pattern is
constituted differently. James had more of the Negative
Forces. He seemed always endeavoring to work through
the impossible.
I was naturally of the Affirmative Force and seemed to
see the simple, practical side of all issues; therefore I
suddenly decided to build my own "castle of creation"
and give vent to that calling, which at that time said,
"Get out and see what the other fellow is doing." The
walls of that old office seemed to smother me.
So I ran away. It was a family disaster at the time,
temporarily: yet it helped to build up history. No man
can accumulate a world of thought in one narrow rut.
He must absorb through the teachings of and rub shoul
ders with studious thinkers. That is stimulus for thought ;

If the leading minds among the Colonists had remained
in their first state of expression there would have been no

A few venturesome men thought larger than their own
state, and went into a neighbor's state to see what the
other people were doing. They brought back to their
own domain the news of PROGRESS through which they

In just that way a world of men created a vast, pulsat

I do greet thee, fair ones, and am fairly elated to verify
my presence here; and first I must tell you that I am one
of the proud sponsors of your BIBLICAL ELUCIDA
TION, in company with many characters of eld and your
near and dear ones who always come to listen and clear
the plane, while Henry Ward Beecher, the prelate, guides
the good "spiritual vibrations," and thus we work in peace
and harmony.
It has been long since I visited your abode. I have been

So many wish to come; but here I am—and if you could
but see one iota of the spiritual surroundings here you
would classify it as heaven —or a spiritual broadcasting
station. But the spirit folk come to vitalize the atmos
phere and build a battery in the flesh of humans.
Now I thank you and we will proceed, for the early
morning hours herald the light of good and spiritual re
alities for the day's work. All is new in the early morning
and man awakens to start on a new life. He is innocent
as a babe as to what the day may bring forth ; yet through
some hidden instinct he places his trust in the inevitable
powers and starts bravely forth, taking much for granted.
Yet what is more serious than living? Each day man
writes a chapter which tells the story of his enactment of
God's Plan for him, as man delineates his career. And
mankind are indeed fortunate to be living in such an age

as the present era, for the twin evils, Ignorance and Super
stition, are dispersing like an unholy miasma. And this
is God enacting truth in the spirit of His children.
The learned, the thoughtful and the wise are now veri
fying the "psychic vibratory law" which is the basis of
all things; but it appears that much of humanity are now
setting aside the most essential work of their helpers of
the past because they are impressed with the idea that the
PSYCHIC ARDOR OF LIFE is unneedful to present
progress and supply; but this is an error.
To energize life with God-perspective is to energize the
body with a sense of Vibration from the Holy Spirit per
vading everywhere. And to be always conscious of this
Vibrative Holy Spirit as a leading factor of usefulness
and success in every breathing moment Spells Perfection
—and this is DIRECTION according to God's Plan.
When man arrives at this understanding and finds
that he can depend upon this "directing of his spiritual
voice," speaking from within him, he finds the PSYCHIC
ARDOR OF PRINCIPLES, which are a safe direction
through life. There one discovers the perfect haven.
We may say that the Restoration of Godliness and
Goodliness upon your plane wholly depends upon this sort
of education for mankind: not so much in ethics or
materialism, but to imbue mankind in accord with
the VIBRATIVE, PSYCHIC OR INVISIBLE
FORCES WHICH ACCOMPLISH ALL THINGS—
AND WHICH ARE GOD HIMSELF.
Man thus may easily see how he can through simple
choice, be in tune with the best thought available any
where, and any truths he has received which have not
fitted in with the basic principal for his Spiritual Good,
he will have the intelligence to automatically set aside as
something entirely pertaining to the physical relations!

ence between the "Physical and the Spirtiual Body" shall
be the only existing religion of the Future, and a most
practical one to live by, and it will reform man's doubtful
characteristics throughout. Your world of direction shall
not change for the best until this knowledge is thoroughly
disseminated amongst men. The essence of true harmony
can never be practically applied until these understandings
of the Practicality of Spiritual Ideals are comprehended.
Man simply must be educated to read the Spiritual Mind
instead of the Carnal Mind.
This is the great unfaltering endeavor of God, and He
is working steadily, and has been to this end all the un
countable ages: to bring human illumination to this point.
But so far the Negative, or Satanic forces, working en
tirely independent of God, have succeeded in creating
a carnal man and a material god, which the true God
must yet throw down.
With the help of God's true children, we feel that this
victory is nigh to being won; and I, as a Spiritual Unit of
God, have never ceased in the struggle with Him for this
supremacy. In the 1300's the John Wycliffe of history
saw a day and time which no one in your era could ever
believe possible. And it is only when I look back to those
dark ages that I fully realize the world progress, though
I have never ceased to mingle with it.
And with those vastly changed conditions for the better,
I also marvel—"Why the unrest on earth?" when human
ity should be so proud of the changes they have wrought
for the better in a spirit of physical evolution. The
promises of God have been so much more fulfilled.
In the days of my boyhood a Bible was a rare thing
to be seen, and then only when man became a slave to
papal forms. What Bibles there were were written in
Latin and chained to heavy posts in dark —one might say
—donjons: places of worship ruled by priests, where

people went to pray in solitary confinement, entirely be
longing to the government of Rome. It was a special
privilege to visit these habitations because the poor were
barred away; only the rich who could pay well, could
have the happiness of even opening a page of these sparse
holy books.
We were instructed that they came straight from
heaven, no one knowing their origin. Religion was
costly, everything being paid for by heavy taxes and
he who had not the price to pay for salvation "was
eternally damned," not by God, but by the parish priest.
Thus it was that all our lands bore the "Mark of the
Beast" and no person was safe unless they obeyed the
call from headquarters to do their bidding.
My parents had means and were able to educate me to
some extent. This education was forcibly received in a
monastery, according to Roman Catholic rule, there being
no other education available. One had to comply with
this dictum or remain in profound ignorance and super
stition. It was indeed a desolate age.
But, as a child, I had an inkling and a determination
to sometime break this bond of slavery: how or when
I knew not; and I did not realize the possible impending
results of that which I intended to accomplish later. In
translating that Latin Bible into English for my people,
I did not realize that it would bring upon my shoulders
the results which later came upon those who took up my
mission and furthered God's cause.
I felt as one ordained from heaven, as the saviour of a
day; and perhaps the world might not have had God's
Wonderful Word so plainly given had I not persisted in
my work. Perhaps your earth, or part of
it,
would not
yet be free to worship according to the Spiritual Right
eousness of the TRUE, SIMPLE, VIBRATING UNI
VERSAL POWER, WHICH IS GOD.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 41
And I may say that God's word shall yet all be so trans
lated into language befitting any day and time, and the
same Spiritual Meanings shall always be intact. In my
time it was considered a sin to translate it into English,
and now some may think the "clarifying of it [elucida
tion] not ethical," but its true Meanings shall never perish
from the earth but shall ever be Magnified into greater
and greater power.
The Bible must expand with the equal expansion of all
principles of life, since God is UNIVERSAL VIBRA
TION SUSTAINING ALL THINGS, AND THE
POWER BEHIND ALL THINGS, AND IS ALWAYS
EXPANDING! He never intended that His Holy
Word should be pinched and cramped and crushed down
by men, and forever hidden behind the symbolic forms
which were essential in the ages of man's evoluting pro
gression to the present day equilibrium.
Nor was it intended according to divine evolution, that
the olden "gabble" should remain for all time, when time
had outgrown its causes and effects. As NEW ERAS
spring into being there must be modernistic forms to fit
all ideals and comprehensions. It may easily seem to
some that still stand behind antiquated ideals, that to
even change the verbiage of God's laws into modern
understandable form, might break the chain of sacredness
which to many is more precious than their life blood.
But remember, beloved, that the LIFE BLOOD IS
ALWAYS CLEARING ITSELF into new forms of free
Spiritual Liberation; and according to nature's own laws
is always manifesting growth and progress. And God's
word must not remain stagnated, but must grow to befit
the new blood. May I, as a sacred authority from heaven,
assure God's children that it is never a sin before the face
of Deity to CLARIFY SPIRITUAL MEANINGS!
The day of secrecy in religion unto the few, has passed.

42 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
Nothing spiritual or helpful is to be hidden, for the ped
dler of pernicious secrecy is finished. And this opening
up of practical truths may cause humanity to accept this
knowledge, when I say, that the books of the Bible were
written in days of the direst despair, when Morale was at
its lowest ebb and Spirituality was barred from succoring
mankind.
Later on it was to speak of the all-powerful apparent
living God as being behind man's Spiritual Strength; and
the words were put into Spiritual Form by redactors so
that the hidden Spiritual Consolation back of the verses
had to suffice for mankind. Man could thus ever grasp
only threads of truth and live accordingly.
In the days of Moses the manoeuvers of the people were
brought foremost and their spiritual desires and wishes
were hidden in symbolic language, lest the doings of the
nations crush God entirely underfoot. And even up to the
Chapters of Revelations, utmost secrecy was impera
tive so that man's life be not taken as ransom for his free
dom of religious thought, and known nearness to Deity.
Christ showed the way out of Paganism, Folly, Fears
and Superstitions wherein life had been bound to the
wheel of Ixionic Narrowness. Theretofore Heaven was
a place for the privileged few who could well pay their
way there. Christ came to show people that Religion
was without price, yet the Tyranny of the olden ideals
held fast and persecuted folk when they saw the truth
of God's words.
Had there not been "Martyrs to the cause" there would
to-day be no white nations upon the face of the earth.
Only barbarians could have existed and Christendom
would be unknown. One may read of the earthly perse
cutions that I suffered to verify my share of God's truths.

though I "trembled my way to the grave," the Spirit
of me was Ever Strong, TRYING TO ESTABLISH
TRUE WISDOM ON EARTH for the future genera
tions; and again a Day was Saved in Christ's cause.
Let me tell my beloved readers, that should the world's
pendulum swing back toward the dark ages, it shall never
reach its climax, because the ALMIGHTY WISDOM
OF GOD IS DETERMINED TO BE UPPERMOST.
At the Crises he always chooses His men at the opportune
moment who shall save the day for Him! —and these car
nal earthly struggles are not yet ended.
The day will come when the Intelligent can no longer
endure bondage and slavery, nor the tyranny of the money
gods. Thus these conditions will grow gradually weaker
with the years, although they shall exist for perhaps many
decades. Progress all depends on the aid which God's
children give to His Evolutive Plans and their desire not
to succumb to Satanic conquest and thereby have su
periority over evil. The worst Satanic god of your day
is the POWER OF MONEY.
Were the value of money taken away—man would
quickly turn to Spiritual Values instead of living on a
material plane. When money gods no longer rule the
earth with the dollar, man shall rule according to the
promptings of his INNER SPIRITUAL VOICE, with the
hand of God thus leading him. This is the only possible
successful course for life, and must be worked out Spir
itually, for God is LOVE, only!
God has no knowledge of hatreds or strife; and the
whole spiritual future for man and his preparation for
the long Hereafter, altogether depends upon his capable
guidance; upon mentors convening together, clasping

men. This may come when five leading nations adopt

spiritual power why does iniquity come into the human
deliberation in the beginning?" "If man was to be Spir
itual how could he outgrow this Spiritual Relationship?"
It is no fault of the Almighty God, creator of all life
that any evil exists, for He created the EGO OF LIFE in
a perfect pattern. But as mind, in its individual relation
ships developed, Satan, an opposing and at times stronger
power, stepped in, according to the NEGATIVE LAW
OF NATURE. This is somewhat as tiny satellites leave
a great star and swirl in space until they become Individ
ual Bodies, thus formulating their own temporal condi
tions just according to elementary contact with other
vibrations.
The source or fountain head of all life is primarily
pure and perfect, no matter what its outer shape may
formulate. And everything Centers Back to Purity ac
cording to its cycle of natural law. No evil remains evil.
But many lessons of life are learned and comprehended
from exhibitions of evil as examples. If man did not
know Sorrow he might not think of God and GOOD ; and
this letter is meant to give the meaning of Good and Bad
and of true Reformation as God intends it to be.
But it must come from Mass Reform; not attempted by
one unit. All units must combine in universal thought
action. We believe this movement to be in its budding
youth. Some of you may not see this truth carried for
ward but it will come in its true light as fast as man learns
the Importance of his Spiritual Self, or Spiritual Body.
Man will then be dissatisfied with his carnal material
ism, and disgusted with bowing to Satan instead of God,
and will find this to be a fictitious habit. He will find
that all the Truth and the Whole Truth lies in the Spir
itual Man, or "Inner Voice."
All churches will consequently comprehend these truths
and preach them; and when the Spiritual Organizations

Christ, they will join hands and smite the producer of
evil and the sneaking propagandist who distributes it
under Satanic jurisdiction, which he aids to supplant God
power, although God entrusted him with His work.
But God will choose Supermen to represent His side of
the law and to establish His Organization.
I was born in 1327, but being frequently thrown into
dungeons without food or air amongst vermin and rats,
this aged me prematurely. Had it not been for the help of
God I should have lost my mind. I turned white at an
early age and did not shave. Men wore beards and long
hair to their shoulders which gave them the look of
patriarchs at a comparatively early age.
My health broke down because of frequent threats of
being burned at the stake. Often I was taken prisoner,
condemned and the fire lighted, and some act of God
reprieved me at the eleventh hour. But these things were
so rasping to the nerves that I broke in health completely
between forty-five and fifty-five and went trembling to
the grave with a partial paralysis of the nervous system.
Now I thank you and I hope to come again. May I say
that I have the high office of Chancellor in the courts of
Christ, and live on Uranus? That is much to have lived
for. Now adieu.

Henry Ward Beecher: Now I have a friend and a
strong character for you this morning.
MARTIN LUTHER
1483-1546
Justification by Faith
Collect your thoughts and list to a spirit of strength
whose voice still lives since days of yore.
I, Martin Luther, selected this time, November 4th,
1929, to visit your humble home, it being the anniversary
of my efforts in the field of Protestantism.
I was born in Germany in 1483, and since passing "over
here" have dwelt upon many planets, and have not re
turned in reincarnation to your earth ; it was needless for
me to come back in fleshy form again amongst men as
my work upon your earth was completed. The principles
promulgated by me in the Fifteenth century were suffi
cient for all time.
First I must endeavor to correct in the hearts of stu
dents any misunderstanding of the meaning of the word
"Protestant." It means a "protest," which was needful
in my time. But there is not much along the lines of
religious bearings that needs protesting against to-day,
except it be man's various differentiated ideas regarding
the SAME FOUNDATION AND PRINCIPLE UN
DERLYING ALL RELIGIONS.
Reasoning back to the FOUNTAINHEAD OF ALL
THOUGHT— GOD—there is no protest possible, for
God is ALL IN ALL in all things. He needs no vicars
and employs none.

or not. No one can get away from it BECAUSE GOD
IS SPIRIT. It is definitely true, that without a Spiritual
Background, RELIGION WOULD BE MEANING
LESS and bear no wisdom or weight; and RELIGION
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE OF LIFE'S
REGIME!
To us "over here," DEITY AND HIS FORCES ARE
THE WHOLE OF OUR EXISTENCE!
Some physical mortals may fancy that RELIGION IS
A THING APART FROM THE SELF OF HIM, and
that they may reflect their life without that spiritual ac
claim. But a soul, empty of God-knowledge, realizes at
its final calling, that the carnal state of conditions which
are unnatural to the finer senses of life, are Abominably
and Damnably REPULSIVE TO GOD.
The coarser carnal manifestations of earth life are the
materials which drag man's soul unto the DUST OF OB
SCENE BITTERNESS IN THE HEREAFTER! Thus
there must truly be established in the mind of mortal man
a SPIRITUAL STANDARD—AN EXPECTANCY OF
GOD— TOWARD WHICH TO AIM HIS EVERY
THOUGHT, that he find the sweetness and perfection of
realization of his mind throughout his life and a Christ
like Atmosphere ever surrounding him.
In the GLORY OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE MAY

CAL RELIGION, WHICH IS THE GOD NATURE

How little importance is there not placed upon the
word "FAITH" in its relation to temporal life in the phy
sical stage of intelligent growth in humanity's ideals ! Yet

tion upon any line of FAITH is unconsciously a moral
coward in the eyes of the Almighty Universal Creator, for
God makes it apparent in all things that GOOD HAS NO
LIMITATIONS.
It is the UTMOST FAITH in the individual which
draws into his concept the POWER OF BEAUTIFY
ING, PROGRESS, and develops his earthly surround
ings onward and upward. Had not the individuals of
great accomplishments had FAITH in the Accomplish
ment of magnificent deeds in the earth's upward course,
and proclaimed before man THEIR TRUE RELATIONS
WITH PROGRESS and GOD, material creations by
human hands would have been at a standstill.
It is the Cooperation by man with the only INFALLI
BLE ONE AND HIS GREAT FORCES THROUGH
WHICH ALL TRUTH IS BORN!
FAITH, in itself, has another meaning: it means
"spirit" —the seed created, Encompassing the spirit of
man in the beginning of creation.
This may be defined by the word "expectancy" or
"dependency," for this is a natural instinct in man that
CANNOT BE BANISHED FROM THE SOUL. It is
inborn in mankind to "expect" and feel "the need" for
SOMETHING DEPENDABLE TO LEAN UPON.
Had not Mortality the belief in Providence or God, the
Instigator of all Good and Dependability, GOOD would
long since have Diminished in its importance in the
minds of men. A WORLD OF SPLENDOR AND
PROGRESS WOULD NEVER HAVE EXISTED.
MATTER CANNOT EVOLUTE WITHOUT MIND,
OR SPIRIT, AS ITS BACKGROUND.
In the days of Illiteracy, true force or infallibility was
recognized— but RECOGNIZED IN FEAR— NOT IN
FAITH ! Superstition ruled, and men were as plastic,
helpless babes groping in the dark —for direction.

Yet there were few capable of giving them proper di
rection out of their own over-ignorance and superstitions:
but GOD REIGNED JUST THE SAME through the
minds of a few "super-developed consciences of men" who
lived and loved, even in those ages.
These men indeed were thought to be unnatural, and
born of some superhuman power. Men feared them more
than loved them, and trembled at sight of them, because
of their own lack of practical understanding.
These Supermen surged directly forward, unafraid to
assert themselves in their new light of intelligence; al
though it was worth one's very life to attempt to bring
anything new to mankind in the days when I trod upon
your earth.
I shall never forget the experience, when, as a young
man, I pinned the NINETY-FIVE PROCLAMATIONS
upon the door of the cathedral at Wittenberg, and quickly
hid from the eyes of the people lest I be crushed under
foot, when I undertook to change the religious laws ac

In this practical age, Humanity now recognize the
JUSTIFICATION OF FAITH in the ministrations of
life which are daily disclosed; Humanity being spiritually
constituted through a natural and practical training is
ready to receive with open arms the UNFOLDMENT OF
PROGRESS, and to fearlessly USE IT in their daily

Limitations which are as yet their standard in physical

LIMIT HIS RELATIONSHIP in regard to any sect.
GOD IS NO UNJUST RESPECTER OF PERSONS,

THAT LOVE through all HIS CREATIVE DOMINION
WITH ABSOLUTE JUSTICE!
There was a time when Roman Catholicism needed
much Recreating; but
it,
too, like other standardized
faiths, through progressive relationships with the world,
has outgrown many man-made absurd tyrannies and
forms of relationship.
At one time
I
denounced this tyranny and some of its
forms of worship. To-day
I
come to the defense of the
better part of Roman Catholicism to this extent, that
it
is
ofttimes absurdly misrepresented in the press.
The reading populace cannot be blamed for what they
read, they having no way to Clarify these Misrepresenta
tions, and they can only await and see the Developments
of the Church, which
is
to be Magnified from the old
forms of Roman Catholicism into
a
Modern Catholi
cism! It may never drop its name, which originated in
Rome; yet
it
shall bear little meaning or relationship
upon the younger generations who are too far advanced
mentally to be bound to the old superstitions and fixed
tyrannical laws relating to the dead and gone doctrines,
and artificial forms.
The Roman Catholic Church, like any other creed
is
BROADENING OUT, though the world may not have
the opportunity to realize this fact in any way except
through reading the press accounts. But, as

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 55
Conditions are being Revolutionized into a FINER SPIR
ITUAL STATE OF RELATIONSHIP!
It is well to state here that ABOUNDING FAITH, or
the EXPECTANCY, NATURAL TO MAN of something
greater, bigger, better and more satisfying in their lives,
has led the religious systems of all denominations out of
the narrow and bigoted forms of other days, until through
the magnified relationships of men with INFINITE
IDEALS, GOD SHALL STAND ALONE IN THEIR
MIDST RECOGNIZED AS THE SAME JUST
FATHER, yesterday, to-day and to-morrow! —as the
SPIRIT FORCE, which KNOWS NO PARTIALITY—
and bears the SAME RELATIONSHIP TO ALL MEN,
ILLIMITABLE IN HIMSELF, yet Forced to Abide by
the Results of MAN'S GOVERNING OF HIMSELF in
earthly matters.
God is the Creative System of all life: the Alpha and
Omega; the Sum and Super-substance of all Material
and Spiritual Forces, YET IS ONLY RECOGNIZED
THROUGH THE MORAL CHARACTER OF MOR
TALITY'S CONCEPTS!
It matters so little what NAME-TAG MEN PIN
UPON THEIR FAITH !
Plato and Homer reflected the same Christianity as
did Jesus Christ, except in the Standardizing of their
faith: yet all were of the same SPIRITUAL INSPIRA
TION: THE TRUE DIRECTORSHIP OF THE
MIND OF GOD planted and emanating through man,
regardless of caste, color, church or state.
CANNOT MAN UNDERSTAND? GOD IS ALL
IN ALL IN ALL THINGS!
To-day, Spiritually, there is no Protestantism; nor
Roman Catholicism. If the SPIRITUAL SLEEPING
CONSCIOUSNESS OF HUMANITY COULD ONLY
AWAKEN TO THE SPIRITUAL TRUTH, that SIM

PLE SPIRITUAL TRUTH ALONE vibrates in and
about them: if they would but RECOGNIZE AND
UTILIZE THIS SIMPLE TRUTH AS THEIR EN
TIRE EMANENCE AND PURPOSE FOR LIVING
there would be no need for the MYRIAD PADDED
LAWS AND PADDED CELLS OF EARTH.
For SIMPLE LIMITLESS TRUTH IS GOD'S
STANDARD, justifiable through magnified faith; and is
what God-manifestation would expect to receive. Man's
birth and prestige have little to do with his case. The
most insignificant human being may have a Mind of Spir
itual Wealth and Purity behind his forbidding outer looks.
Socrates was the homeliest human being imaginable,
yet he had a Mind far too eminent for a man of his time.
His soul ruled him, and his material concept took on but
its simplest earthly relationship. Socrates was a man
whose Spirit dominated in the principles of philosophical
truths. He placed his faith in the strength of God as
being limitless, and Recognized that THERE WAS
NOTHING IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM SPIRITUALLY.
Savonarola was the Reincarnation of Socrates, and he
again came back to earth to build a MONUMENT FOR
TRUTH. The hands of carnal men in banishing the
promulgator of that truth, because they disliked the God
that he magnified, have suffered. Yes! though their bones
have long since mouldered, THEIR SOULS HAVE
LONG REPENTED THEIR ACTIONS in Hades.
And those who crucified our Lord Jesus Christ in the
face of God have suffered the punishment and agonies of
many deaths in their consciences. They are EARTH-
BOUND SPIRITS: seeing all the gratifications of the
beauties of God magnified, yet by Satan's charge, they
are not allowed to WITHDRAW FROM THEIR OLD
CONCEPTS which are punishing them forever.

OF GOOD continue to teach mankind the TRUE

of Good they are planned to be—not Destroyers ; and the
Evil must suffer in the end.
But without Faith GOOD WORKS are dead, as dead as
the sufferers in Hades are to life in its happiest realities
while dwelling in the REALMS OF PENANCE.
It may seem strange to some to say that there are
Realms of Penance, but IT IS TRUE. Otherwise there
could be no justice.
God does not keep watchers out in the field of earth's
activities to record the sins of mankind: but the SUPER-
CONSCIENCE WITHIN MAN RECORDS ALL HIS
DEEDS, kind and unkind throughout his whole life, and
THIS IS AN OPEN BOOK IN ETERNITY!
Man, at all times, CARRIES HIS OWN RECORD!
No track of it may be seen by humanity if man cover his
sins up in life, and no man may know the truth, BUT
ALL IS KNOWN TO HEAVEN!
Eternity is not a place of secrecy; every sin is SELF-
UNCOVERED and the MAN PAYS. Not through
PHYSICAL STRESS, but through the STRESS OF HIS
CONSCIENCE, which is far more Poignant than the
temporal miseries of earthly punishment.
Thus, if a man escape the hand of the law in the earthly
regime, HE CANNOT ESCAPE GOD and his deserved

OF ALL JUSTIFICATION.

UPON THE GOOD SHIP OF STATE. May all men
become the Captains of their souls. May they always
say,
"I am the master of my fate;
I am the captain of my soul."
This Spiritual Knowledge should escape no man. It
should be imprinted upon the walls before the babe as
soon as it is old enough to understand, making it realize
that it is an individual ship, sailing through life upon
the billowy waters of fate, and that it IS what its
THOUGHT— as its captain—MAKES IT. That its
HARBOR is where IT AIMS ITS SHIP OF STATE
TO LAND, in the haven of GOOD, or on the SHOALS of
BAD ACTS.
The result of a good life is the landing in eternity with
a splendid record, or the wrecking of his ship upon the
rugged shores of unbelief and failure in misconstrued
ideals.
Psychologists from the oldest days, the teachers and
sages from olden times to the present day will assure
the world THAT THE EARLIEST TRAINING OF
THE CHILD-MIND DECIDES THE DESTINY of
that soul, and the boundaries of its faith.
Now I hope that I have delivered to you a worthwhile
message which will awaken the desires of mortality to
BELIEVE IN THE INFALLIBLE STRENGTH OF
THE INFINITE; and to know that the SUPER-RELA
TIONSHIPS OF LIFE ARE THE GOD-ABIDING
VIBRATIONS WHICH CONSTITUTE LIFE AND
LOVE, SUCCESS AND HAPPINESS. So spiritually I
say "Amen."
(He added) "The ninety-five resolutions which I wrote
were the beginning of a constitution that built up a church

And they caused a widening breach through which man's
ideas were able to escape his Ingrown Superstitions
handed down through the Illiteracy and Cowardice re
flected from past beliefs and teachings.
MARTIN LUTHER.
JOHN KNOX
1513-1572
Religion and Life
This is John Knox, indeed. A very fine morning, my
ladies: fair as the heather in our bonnie wee Scotland.
You see I have still a fondness for my bonny country.
Near Edinburgh was the place of my birth, but I much
prefer the doons and the sweet smelling heather.
Flowers remind one of the refineness of life, and one's
relationship to God.
Very elated am I to be one in your consciousness this
day; although I ne'er like this woody instrument (Ouija
board). Me believe I canna handle it aright. Be of pa
tience and perseverance with a new-found hand. The
lady may sense the words for I ne'er can find the letters,
having so long been away from the physical pen. Yea
and it is difficult to pick it up again, but it is a privilege of
God that I be with you this day to talk about my memoirs
of living-relations while on the earth.
Aye, and I am glad that REFORMATION has grown
a great and holy name in the lives of Christian thinkers,
and that the struggles of past ages are as dead ashes of
yore, never to be rekindled; for Man's Intelligence befits
his Spiritual Growth to-day.

6o LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
Nay, nay! I would not have the courage to experience
the struggle which took place during my physical experi
ence in Scotland and England and the Continent. Mighty
pluck had I. It was a gift from heaven. Had I not had
this pluck, there would have been no Presbyteria; and the
modern ideal would not have fructified to bloom.
It was as much as a man's life was worth under Mary,
Queen of Scots, to outwardly tell one's finer sentiments
concerning the outer conditions of life. But governments
have climbed to higher knowledge, where the issues of the
day are not ereated through some woman's whim.
Yet, bless her soull she herself REFORMED in the
Land of Eternity and recompensed her faults by spirit
ually correcting many adages of her day and time, in
spite of her eccentric ideas. Even so: I cannot help but
feel the wee stroke of her hand. Admiration is a magnet,
and Mary, Queen of Scots herself was a magnet, a strong
magnetic temperament which turned our little world to
turmoil.
As I look back to those days I have no bitter feeling,
for it was my SPIRITUAL DUTY to break asunder the
old traditions, in which I, as a beginning in such cause,
succeeded. That was my Mission in Life.
I evolved that mission for others to follow in the path
way of newly regenerated ideals; and can a man do more
IN THE NAME OF GOD?
In those old days man hid behind his sincerity, as a man
hides behind his whiskers: no one knowing just what his
features are, beguiled with the tuft-like sproutings on his
face. Wise men say the countenance is a gift from the
divine. In my time it was fashionable even for youth to
wear these tufts upon the face. I hid not always behind
them, for I truly endeavored to show my true self in God
like Personality and Righteousness for TRUTH.

in my ideals: a bond of three in the name of a perfect
REFORMATION of the laws which so bound mankind
to Superstition and trivial ways.
Aye! If it had not been for the wee mind dormant in
the hearts of men, they would have realized the greatness
of the minds of these two CO-WORKERS in the cause of
a NEW ERA about to be born.
Papistry and Popery have much advanced in knowledge
to the conditions that prevailed in our century, for the Al
mighty, All-knowing Creative Spirit has much advanced
the minds of men and built up a UNIVERSE OF MIND
in which GOD has come to light as the ruler OVER ALL
THINGS.
We, the beginners for God, with Martin Luther at the
head of the crusade, DESIGNATED A PATTERN so
that all thinking men might work out a PERFECT PIC
TURE FOR GOD.
Denominations? Nay! SPIRITS SEE BUT THE
PERFECT MIND OVER ALL despite the sin and
degradation prevalent upon your earth plane to-day which
is encouraged by the carnal mind; yet it does not compare
with the time of the Dark Ages, which are past: for the
mind of men through suffering and sacrifice in the physi
cal form, have long denounced the sacrilege of blood and
hatred. They find a lasting peace and faith in GOOD
WILL ON EARTH TO MEN: the song written in the
birth of the SON O' MAN.
Denominations have lost much of their value. Creeds
and doctrines individually planned have lost much of their
meaning. GOD ALONE IS THE ONLY CREED
MAKER—and writes in the Heavens a story of UNI
VERSAL LOVE Intermingling with SPIRITUALITY:
that Penetrating Force through which all men know
Righteousness and Peace.

edness amongst the brethren, to erase for all time the
names of Denominations: for man has come to know there
is ONLY ONE CHANNEL and ONE THOUGHT in
which to find ETERNAL REST AND BEAUTY UPON
EARTH, and this is Stamped upon the Consciousness and
the Soul in burning letters "SPIRITUALITY."
And I would, were I bishop of earth over the churches,
—not classify the churches any longer. A man ne'er
cares for God when he cares more for the NAME of his
church.
And I would have such signs to advertise the meeting
houses of God: a bright electric sign reflected afar, direct
ing the attention, and flashing these words: "PEACE ON
EARTH, GOOD WILL TO MEN." . . . "LOVE ONE
ANOTHER." ... "A PERFECT MIND MAKES
PERFECT PEACE FOR GOD."
And these signs would be fastened before the doorways
of cathedrals and churches, the meeting places of the
masses, so that in some way these insignias might be im
printed upon all souls.
Improvement is a Spiritual Virtue of God, and your
churches yet speak too much of their Individuality, sepa
rating the masses instead of bringing them together in
this improved line of thought concerning the Perfect Way
to the Divine.
Goodness and Worship are not the only ideals to be
found in the perfect route of life. There must be Fellow
ship, and Brotherhood between men, Castes must be abol
ished: for are not all of God's children eventually to reach
His throne?

Old conditions are slowly passing: I thank the Father.
In my long experience, I prayed for Reformation of these
Conditions, and have seen many old ideals pass from view

by which I mean "Building a way to God."

man helps to build up a perfect direct prevailing issue:

In my time RELIGION WAS A BOILING POT
UPON THE FIRES OF SACRIFICE! But, aye! one

about Porridge! It will fill an empty stomach and has
physical strength.—Yea—Man knows that! —but where
is the glory in satisfying a human robot?
Life religiously verifies the Importance of Progress and
the Upbuilding of BEAUTY as Reflected through the
MIND. Therefore it behooves men to pay heed to their
SOULS, not to their Stomachs.
To pay heed to the Soul does not bar out LOVE: for
LOVE, when SPIRITUALLY EXPRESSED is the
HIGHEST OFFICE OF THE COSMOS. Man is too
busy in his material expression nowadays to know THE
REFINEMENT in SPIRITUAL AND PERFECT
LOVE, "one for another." He worships the dollars and
spends his physical strength striving in the name of
Mammon instead of in the name of GOD.
It is detrimental to the finer senses of life to reflect
one's life along this course. Money satisfies the heart
but canna buy WISDOM of God. This is priceless !
And now to convince you it is indeed I who write this
advice to mortals I want you to know a wee bit of my
private life on your earth, and "over here." Marriages
are made on earth, but TRUE LOVE lives forever: not in
any carnal sense in which most loves are reflected in life's
course, but in the "finer spiritual sense," which even I as
a Spirit could not make mortal mind understand! It can
only be visualized when you come "over here."
Margery was my true earthly wife. She passed from
my earthly embrace but a few years after we were wed:
but God, the great Mind of Spiritual Love, hath never
parted our touch.
Again I wed, and how strange, a Margaret, too, who
still believes in me. We are all good friends, a better

Divorce! Bah! a silly pastime. Does a man believe
because he sees no more of his mate on earth that he shall
escape them in Eternity? Nay! not if LOVE Live, for
LOVE cannot be Destroyed! High, undying love shall
follow ever. But should man and wife ne'er care for one
another while in the nuptial life on earth, they are parted
asunder as if they had never known each other.
Their life was an Error of the Negative Forces which do
not belong to God or to the name of Love. Modern
"love" has grown into a mere bugaboo, because the ma
terial things of life blot out the Kiss of God above the
brow. Only Spiritual Enlightenment of the Soul can
make a man KNOW THE TRUE WORTH OF RO
MANCE IN ITS PERFECT BLISS.
When a material body creates a Material Standard it
LOSES THE VALUE OF LOVE ! KEEP TRUE LOVE
EVER EMANATING for it is the SPIRITUAL FIRE
OF ETERNITY! AND LET NOT THE MATERIAL
SANDS QUENCH THE FIRE OF THE SPIRIT, for
when man LOSES SIGHT OF LOVE HE LOSES SIGHT
OF GOD!
Place LOVE on a Higher Standard: destroy its cheap
ened outer garments which make the ALMIGHTY ALL-
SEEING EYE OF GOD TURN AWAY HIS FACE IN
SHAME. Take not the name of married bliss and
cheapen its garments with lusts, for that IS NOT OF
GOD'S PLAN.
So much I would advise material mortal friends, but
perhaps I have said enough for this missive. Yea! I

Henry Ward Beecher: Here we are. Again WE

part in our work.
BENEDICT SPINOZA

The Larger Life
Lift your mind above material things and list to me,
ladies (the mediums): yet I am not so Spiritual as you
might believe. We are always interested in your con
versations. Sometimes we denounce them, the erroneous
ideas and ideals which come upon people. You will have
to learn and you have yet much to learn; but so did I:
I had plenty to learn.
In all the many years which I have spent in the spir
itual world I have continuously learned, and shall always
learn, FOR IT IS THE LAW OF LIFE! To Learn is to
APPROACH GOD, and there are no Limitations for
Learning, for God is Limitless in all ways, and He is
Everywhere.
Man is a brother to the tree and akin to the flower;
although he may visualize himself as a superior being—he
is created of the same CREATIVE MATERIAL in Unity
with the God-spirit of Creation.
The "theologies of life" are but the expressions of
Man's moods : how he thinketh, how he accepts the truths
of life's Expressional Moods in Relation to Deity.
Theology was never intended to be Standardized! It
is only to be Accepted in its Natural Simplicity; and the
saying is very true—AS MAN THINKS, SO IS HE.

Thus the material issues arise out of the dregs of ERRO
NEOUS IDEALISM through man's own Self-sufficiency,

vision, than that of his brother of lower standards in na

Theology Analyzed, IS THE SUM AND SUB

Self-reliance —Self-sufficiency and Divine Power: these
"forces of nature" were never Intended to be Restrained
so that Man should accept any Fixed Law of another
person, which does not befit his nature.
The nature of humanity is like the rosebud bursting
out into bloom, each day unfolding a petal, until one
visualizes DEEP INTO THE HEART OF ITS SOUL-
CONSCIOUSNESS and sees the Perfection therein.
Until man delivers himself from the bondage of fixed
man-made laws, pertaining to his thinking powers, he will
never know the TRUE DIVINITY OF GOD. Too long
have teachers of learning of different classes tarried with
the Thought, that the student should make a record of
past and obsolete standards and fixed laws and obey
them implicitly, following them as his own fixed stand
ards for the future.
Thus Man —having the daily Experiences of Seeing
the Movements and Changes of Evolution and Progress
in God's nature—IS NOT TRUE TO HIS OWN SOUL-
CONSCIOUSNESS, WHEN HE ALLOWS HIS MIND
STANDARDS TO BECOME STAGNATED through
the Self-obeyance of Past and Dead Constitutions which
had no FAR-SEEING VISION INTO THE FUTURE.

to-day, however, according with his advanced thinking
qualities, is looking far ahead into the future—so much
so, that he has little time to enjoy the DIVINE GLORY
OF EACH DAY IN WHICH HE LIVES, but hurriedly
rambles over the hours like a mill-race. This is an utter
Tragedy on the part of the individual, for he should drink
of the richness of the daily waters of life.
He should also DREAM AND PLAN FOR THE
MORROW! It has not been many years that man's
thinking faculties were developed to think of more than
one thing at a time, for he more or less left his destiny to
fate; but to-day the Thinking Process includes the Scien
tific, Mathematical and Divine Problems of life.
Like all issues of nature, man has developed from a
seed of seeming stupidity into a world of intellect and
promise. If he would, —while in his transitory state of
growth on earth, dwell more upon his mental equilibrium
than the physical —he would have the world of glory at
his feet.
This is a stupendous age in which you fortunate mortals
live. If I had had the liberty of emanating my thoughts
and feelings as freely as you individually are at liberty
to do, while I was a supplicant at the Hague, I could have
formed a League of Nations that would have held for all
time.
My Assertions would have been TO EXERCISE
THOUGHT, IN THE NAME OF GOD: not in the name
of Mammon.
I was born of a Jewish father,—one of the old Orthodox
Jews,—and a Moorish mother who escaped from the
Ravages which they considered Christendom to be, in
reality from the hands of a handful of Jews in disguise
who called themselves Heretics, according to their
Heresies.

religion of his fathers. So after I was born I was also
brought up to believe staunchly in the ideals of the old
Jewish synagogues.
Father was one of the first men in history to accomplish
the art of making lenses, and he established a workshop
with his business, and brought me up accomplished in this
art, so that I, too, might earn my daily way.
Yet that was not all of father's life, for he was learned
in Latin and Greek; and from him, while working with
him at his bench, I received my education.
It did not dawn upon him that I was a Branch of
his tree and might bear new leaves of promise—which is
nature's natural development of characteristics; this he
did not visualize, because he had not reached that Stage
of Mental Growth, which some superior force of nature
had FORCED ME TO ACCEPT AS MY BELIEF IN
GOD and my future trend of life and living.
Coming to the time when I could no longer agree to
his limited standards of thinking-powers, I felt it my
duty, rather than to hurt his feelings, to go away and start
in for myself. Manuscript which I had written fell into
the hands of my father and his associates, which they
denounced and destroyed and cursed from the bottom of
their honest hearts, not knowing the author of these
awakening messages.
Had they known the truth that I was the author I
would not have lived to accomplish my purposes. It was
my boyhood dream to direct my people away from their
fixed laws. They were bounded on the north by LAW,
on the south by LAW, on the east by LAW, and on the
west by LAW.
The priest of the synagogue kept the standard book of
fixed law, that they of the old orthodox religion of the
Jewish faith were to obey—even to the extent of How

SLAVES OF CIRCUMSTANCES! Slaves to laws
formulated by leaders of long past ages,—POOR
BLINDED SOULS, deprived of every vestige of their
Own Individuality; yet helpless under these circum
stances.
I began to believe more and more each day in the
CREED OF JESUS CHRIST. This was always put up
to me as a throttle of fear against disobeying any of their
fixed laws. But when my people told me how Jesus and
His disciples went into the corn field on Sunday and
partook of the corn when they were hungry —and my
people said—"they should have waited until Monday to
take the corn"; that would not have been an offense
against the Jewish doctrine; I, on my part, believed if
there were plenty for all, and a man was DOING A
GOOD WORK, he DESERVED to feed his physical
body so that his Spiritual Body might continue in his
good works and be strong.
I did not believe in the interminable fastings, so secretly
I broke these rules and regulations of the creed. Thus
when the truth finally came to the eyes and ears of my
associates they added unchristian-like denunciations to
excommunication from their Jewish services, as if I were
something unclean.
Ah! But how I pitied their small meannesses: FOR
I FULLY REALIZED THE BEAUTY OF THE
LARGER LIFE and the Limitations they suffered under
in their narrow lives.

and is satisfied to put that FREEDOM OF THOUGHT
INTO CONCRETE FORM and NEW IDEALS which
will lift up the power of mentality to the TRUE PRIN
CIPLES OF GOD VISION!
Having to carry my thoughts secretly to keep from
hurting my father, I hid away for a time among the
Mennonites, who accepted me into their homes, and there
I sought shelter and established my shop, going on with
my trade of lens-making, and writing as a hobby. I had
no hope of ever establishing this Higher Thought as I
viewed it among mankind.
To me my thoughts and hopes were so real that I lived
much alone with them and kept my pen very close to me,
lest I lose some of my inspired wealth. But had I not
had my trade upon which to depend for a livelihood, per
haps I would have become so Unconscious of my body,
that I would have perished through my Mental Attitude
of DIRE CONCENTRATION IN MY WISH TO
LEAVE NEW THOUGHT STANDARDS TO THE
WORLD!
It is an accepted fact that the first thing a Jew thinks
of in the rearing of children is to teach them to be useful
in the world, and how to make a livelihood. Had I desired
I could have realized much of the world's wealth through
delving into scientific discoveries and unfolding new
truths concerning artificial lenses for the eyes.
But my lenses for the physical eye had little attraction
for me; for it seemed the ORDAINED WORK OF MY
LIFE TO DEVELOP THE LENSES OF THE SOUL,
that all Humanity might receive their due Spiritual Re
ward at the end of their earthly life. And all through the
years, Inspirationally and Spiritually—with Thinking,
Expanding Vision— I have been a PART OF THOSE

ITUAL LENSES OF THEIR HUMAN SOULS.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 73
There is no greater deed for mankind to perform
than to REALIZE THE GOD-VISION which cannot be
seen through physical eyes! for in truth the GREATEST
VISION IS ONLY ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH
THE SPIRITUAL EYES.
He who is deprived of his physical sight is altogether
blessed, for he soon perceives a greater and a wider Vi
sion: and depends more and more upon his INTUITIVE-
NESS than upon his physical qualities and faculties.
In my earthly occupation I often thought how stupid
it was to be helping man to see PHYSICALLY when I
had the power to help him to see SPIRITUALLY. The
POWER OF INTUITIVENESS IS THE DIVINE
POWER of God manifested through mankind.
AND TO THIS POWER ALL INITIATIVE IS TO
BE CREDITED!
The higher thinking faculties come from this POWER
OF INTUITIVENESS, ABSORBED BY GOD-VIBRA
TION FROM SPACE AND ETERNITY, AND CRE
ATING AUTOMATICALLY THE LARGER LIFE
AND THE NOBLER CAUSE.
When deriving Thought through Intuitiveness —Igno
rance diminishes like the snowflake before the fire of life.
Humanity receives a HOLD UPON SOMETHING that
they, in their physical acclamation of thought, CANNOT
FEEL NOR DESCRIBE; yet they know in their Soul-
consciousness that something in connection with God
has been discovered which is more priceless than so many
perfect pearls.
Ofttimes Humanity pass through many lives before
they find the full strength of this precious gift of Soul-
expression. It ofttimes is awakened when LOVE crosses
one's path.
There are many phases of LOVE: the highest is the

Love of God; the second phase is Love of parents; the
third, is the Love for one's mate, and the fourth is the
Love for one's offsprings. The fifth Love is the LOVE
of the FULNESS OF NATURE in its spiritual trend,
evoluting about all these centers of affection and attrac
tion.
Man must know, in truth, the depth and value of LOVE
to gain the precepts of higher thought; and it was my
secret love for Clara—unfortunately one—whose mer
cenary ideals of life could not fit in with my spiritual
ideas —that caused deep thought in me; and we drifted
apart.
Through the intuitive Love I held for Clara I trembled
at the mention of her name; and I sought consolation with
the pen as my sole compensation until my earthly life
drifted out into the spiritual sequel of added bliss, in
which sex plays no part—This being but a temporal phase
through which physical growth of man passeth.
After that man finds that the LOVE which held his
"foundational thought centers" GOES BACK TO GOD;
yet one ne'er FORGETS those whom he has held in the
embrace of earthly emotional faith and love —there is
simply a finer feeling and a greater Companionship in
eternity.
The worship of Love here mixes with Intellect; and
Clara and I together now organize magnificent dramas
and plays, music and songs, that cannot compare with
those of your earth, so much finer are our Vibrations and
Senses: their concept being divinely higher and the Vibra
tions tuned beyond your natural ken; yet, at will, we at
tend ANY UPLIFTING AND EDUCATIONAL FUNC

are no limitations to spiritual force and spiritual learning.

his God, for He is the Instrument to command fate.
Predestination works only as far as MAN HIMSELF
DRAWS THINGS TO HIM. He is the MAGNET of
all GOOD, born of the same spirit as that of God and
the same WORKING POWER, having the same mental
equilibrium —though the mental equilibrium of man is
Retarded in Growth, and God ever Expands in Growth.
This is a difficulty that confronts the human.
It was my life-work to lead my fellowmen out of this
groove of narrow bigoted thought, and widen their field
of observation and experience in the higher Vibrations of
life—For man will be limited in intelligence as long as
he thinks only through his physical forces.
Once he starts to think through his "psychical senses,"
he will soon find himself outgrowing the shell of past
adages and past beliefs, and that they no longer befit the
day in which he expresses his being. He will find, al
though he does not reach the "plane of spiritual realiza
tion," that there is a world of promise beyond his physical
reactions which, through his INTUITIVENESS HE
FEELS, although he cannot Visualize it.
However, he always finds the LARGER LIFE PREF

in progressional growth, man must find a TRUE OPEN-
MINDED SATISFACTORY THEOLOGY and also a
practical theology! —One that is useful, and eminently
practicable in man's momentary life to his physical eyes
through which he visualizes the world around him. By
this knowledge he builds up practical concepts and makes
a paradise on earth.
As hosts of eternity, and in Unity with God-force, we

GIVES TO MAN ALL THE MATERIAL with which

of crude and carnal contact; but to make of the waters

man in laws on all sides, and most limited in growth.
I see the day coming when SPIRITUALITY will be
uppermost as the Standard of every man's curriculum:
where dead religions and false standardized creeds shall
fall into the dust of decay; and the new pattern of the
LIVING VITALIZING GOD shall dwell openly in all
men —as a pattern, wherein man shall not have to "die" to
LEARN THE PRINCIPLES OF THE TRUE
HEAVEN. He shall find upon earth the secret of "spirit
ual longevity" and the Knowledge of how to use his God-
given birthright: his INTUITIVE SENSES, to create
for himself a Heavenly Surrounding.
He shall find that God never dwelt beyond the reach
of man's hand, but always was and forever permeates all
things— FOR NATURE AND GOD ARE ONE! And
SPIRITUALITY is but the EXPANSION OF NA
TURE'S MIND!

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 77
This new addition to knowledge will not take away one
iota of truth from God's-Word. The Bible stands as
a true Exposition of facts and bears the history of people
adown the ages, how they lived, what they did and what
they thought.
But this is not to say that it tells how people live to-day
in their progressional and spiritual growth ; yet the Moral
Lessons prevailing throughout the Bible are there forever
and aye: the Standardized Thought, and the Truths of
God Himself, which no human soul can set aside, and not
be deceitful to himself and his brother.
If the Bible had been Continued in its Writing, and
man had never stopped writing
it,
it
would have also
borne the history of the ages since existent and not re
corded in the Holy Book. In this event one could see
for himself —when passing down through the fields of his
tory and progressional growth —that man has arisen into
a
"higher state of consciousness." This
is
not at all to
say that man shall ever discredit the Bible, for it
is
the
Rock of Ages, establishing throughout Christendom the
Unselfish Principles of Jesus Christ.
The Bible
is
a
book of healthy wisdom; but his vision
is
paralyzed who still tries to carry the banners of stand
ards of ancient days. Those old standard bearers were
eminently sincere, and religiously triumphant in their
day and time, but their day
is
past, and only memories
of them are left.
It
is
only like God's beautiful trees that bear flowers;
however, last year's flowers pass away, never to return
in the same light. Thus this
is
a
lesson that human mind
must keep apace with this TRINITY OF DIVINE WIS
DOM, lest
it
be lost in the material and limited concept
of mankind's thoughts.
Also proud mortality must awaken and crack its shell

—get out in the open and KEEP APACE WITH GOD.
Many of you are far behind and are wearying in the "ruts
of untruths" on the roadway of life.
Look about you. See how God is forever CREATING
AND RECREATING! Why should Man limit the
SPIRITUAL SPARK OF PROGRESSION OF HIS
CREATIVE SOUL?
He does so only because he is not aware of his SPIR
ITUAL MISSION, or GOD'S PLAN for him for his
little lifetime on earth.
Humanity need only to VITALIZE their SOUL-WIS
DOM: doing away with the set ideals and set standards
of theology—knowing that RELIGION—just like every
thing else in nature—is FORCED TO GROW AND EX
PAND AND OPEN AND BLOOM! In thus establish
ing this Cause for God THE LARGER IS THE LIFE
OF HUMANITY.
Q. Have you a message for Father Behr, for he is
going to expand when he receives this letter?
A. Yes; tell him that the young Jewish nation shall
become Spiritualists; and the old Jewish nation shall fast
fade away.

and the STRENGTH OF GOD, in whose mission he is
delivering a Worldwide Consolation.

The Art of Mental Direction
I thank you for your kind introduction, Mr. Beecher;
and I may have been a radical to my friends for one must
enforce laws through strict forms at times. You see I
lived in an age when people did not realize the value of
their faculties, and oft I had to put a cannon ball in the
cannon that the volley of truth be heard by the world.
We are all Possibilities of Magnetic Ethereal Power,
each unit destined to work out his own particular pattern
in the creation of spiritual matter. The various relation
ships of Deity are countless, and when one endeavors to
fathom them, one has a lifelong endeavor before him to
perfect.
Then also this Perfection is ne'er to be realized while
one is conscious of his "physical embodiment" as part
of his own individual being—the human mind cannot
grasp its meaning! Mind has two trends while in the
bodily relation —intermingling Spirit and Matter in daily
travel, so Truth is seldom recognized by the busy in
dividual who feels, that it is necessary to struggle for
his daily bread.
Yet, after all, the influencing tide of life should lean
more toward strengthening the Spiritual Body wherein
the true man dwells in common with Deity. The limita

ties that one reflects, the lesser ratio the Physical occu
pies in importance.
The Finer Attributes of Life are the actual MATE
RIAL of GOD—HIS TRUE SPIRIT OF VIBRA
TION! in other words a PART OF THE HOLY GHOST
OR UNIVERSAL CREATIVE FORCE PERMEATING
EVERYWHERE: but it is that which the physical mind
cannot touch or define! The Spiritual Intuition of man,
however, can Visualize and Substantiate this force as
their "master of destiny," for it is really God Himself and
His all-seeing vision when fully analyzed. In truth it is
the ALL-SEEING, ALL-VIBRATING UNIVERSAL
MIND!
Man's vision is limited owing to his mental attitude,
and the people whom Christ designated as the sheep lost
from His fold are those of limited consciousness and
limited faith, whose fires seldom emanate further than
what their physical eyes can visualize at a particular time.
Thus man Encases his own Formulated Ideals, and the
form of life which God intended for him, is thoroughly
camouflaged! so it is time for the true course of thinking
along the Spiritual Lines of Vibration to master his mind.
The Law of Attraction merely parallels in meaning the
Law of Spiritual Vibration; the two are exactly the same
thing. Yet the one appears to be scientific, because it
has been in past historical records scientifically analyzed
according to mathematical precision. But as a truth no
one can measure the law of direction except in a limited
physical sense.
Spiritual Vibration, or Spiritual Energy, is the GOD-
LIFE participating with mankind. There is no special
privilege for seers or prophets in any cultivated psychic
sense, this is seemingly handed down through heritage,
or gift, and it is a natural faculty of common sense think

ing direction, or the art of using Natural Magnetic Force
along the "lines of thought." Words, coming from the
SOUL, Applied along the Lines of Magnetic Thought, are
JUST EXACTLY THE SAME AS IF GOD HAD
SPOKEN to man!
These Thoughts become the structural and progressive
monuments builded upon the shores of time, and know no
bounds or limitation. They are Forces of Thought sent
out into space capable of any magnitude of accomplish
ment.
If a person is shallow, or carnal, his thoughts do not
travel afar, but fade away from the waves of spiritual
direction into nothingness.
The first rule in the Law of Direction, relative to mind,
is to SPEAK WITH FULL DIRECTION OF POWER
AND MAGNETIC FERVOR IN EVERY WORD
SPOKEN, THUS CHARGING ONE'S MENTAL
WAVES. This is cultivating a personality which shall be
forever felt long after the physical body has expired.
And this is the reason why some people are born to lead
a weak uneventful life, while others have a spiritual force
that connects with soul wisdom, and through experience
becomes awakened and Aspires and Succeeds in the
Higher Life.
If a man's life has been a blunder in its lack of char
acter, he must return to earth and go through new ex
periences to complete his work and his cycle. Often man
has only a peep into heaven before he is back again on
earth to correct his misconstrued life and to build a
higher type of manhood for the future when he will not
be a misfit in his ethereal orbit.

but it was not as God planned for Isaac Newton, for his
soul expostulated, and felt its mission and vital duty to be

Through love and compassion for my dear mother I
endeavored to take over the responsibilities of a farm
when my stepfather passed away, being a lad in my teens.
I had been sent to school for limited periods and the in
ventive spirit was already fired to the height of my young
soul, and mother was only driven to distraction because
I paid so little heed to the sheep.
I remember allowing them to devour her growing things
and run rampant over the garden. She would call fran
tically for me and I was nowhere to be found, but finally
she would unearth me from behind a hedge where I had
been in oblivion studying the higher sciences of mathe
matics. And I could no more have prevented that true
call of my soul than the sun from rising, had I endeavored
to do so.
Uncle discovered that it was a waste of time to keep
me tied to mother's farming ambitions, and that it would
be more reasonable to employ a responsible man and
return me to the thing more akin to my nature. And
now you have the decisive answer of one who sought help
along the lines of the "law of attraction."
As you have been told, the SOUL IS THE STORE
HOUSE OF CREATION! and one must study to be
fully in tune with the allotted pattern for one's soul. One
unconsciously knows that one has a plan to work out; so
from childhood my mind was always endeavoring to
fathom the Seemingly Impossible along the lines of math
ematical precision.
In proof of my theories I worked out these precisions
in material forms, and I can still laugh at my horseless

it could be applied to a solidified form and to practical
uses.
Had my uncle not discovered this spiritual trend in me
for delving into the unknown, perhaps the secret of the
meaning of the rainbow would not have been discovered,
neither the law of gravity or energy, nor the analysis of
the sunbeam, had I been driven to be a farmer and to feed
only the physical man. So you realize what these ex
periences brought about.
Thus my return to Cambridge was the beginning of
opportunity whereby my "spiritual intuition" could rule
Isaac Newton's soul—not hampered by the physical side
of earthly interferences. If a youth be given the oppor
tunity to carry on his own pattern in life, the physical
relations will take care of themselves most naturally; but
he must primarily give attention to his Spiritual Body
and Continuity of Life, to be successful!
Teachers and parents should pay strict attention to the
Analyzation of the deeper and spiritual desires of the
youth entrusted to them, and listen to what Mother Na

come into this "clarified understanding" as something per
fectly natural to their being; and not at all supernatural.
And do not think for a moment that Isaac Newton was
perfect. Like anyone else his experiences and experi
ments taught him slowly the pathway of spiritual expres
sion in its higher lights. My uncle had the intelligence
to allow me to start aright, and there is a Law of Adher
ence, or another Natural Law of Attraction, wherein one
principle is attracted to another and thus Slowly Grows
into a "concrete idea."
It may sound strange to introduce another subject
here; but I wish to say that one's associates are of vital
importance in one's life, for they have much to do with
one's mental direction. At one time I met some gamblers
and was much taken in by them which was an excellent
lesson, for I soon fully understood that the presence of
inferior mentality led a weaker brother away from his
orbit of expression, and toward a fall.
My second stumbling block occurred when I thought it
manly to tip the cup that inebriates; and this had a
pointed lesson for me, for the after results entered my
consciousness. I saw that youth was most indubitably
precious, and was not to be prostituted by evil tempta
tions and dissipation.
Something GOOD took hold of me with this thought,
and I quickly waved away my desire for these two evils
of the idlers' paradise. Thus I drew real lessons, that,
had I listened to EVIL, the law of attraction would have
downed me for all time. I think I may say of them, how
ever, that they made me a better man—for the scars were
a warning for all time.
Another salient lesson from this angle
is,
THAT MAN
GETS OUT OF LIFE JUST EXACTLY WHAT HE
PUTS INTO IT; and at that not so much physically, for
physical ideals crumble and return to dust and nothing

ness. Even the pyramids of Egypt are decaying with the
endless procession of the ages, AND PHYSICAL EN
DEAVOR DOES NOT REACH ETERNITY!
But when once MENTAL POSSIBILITIES ARE
BORN, and proceed according to the law of attraction
toward the fountainhead of success, this creative power
lasts forever ! Man may not fulfil his work in one gen
eration, but no idea or effort is ever lost! and if a man
is unable to carry out his plan for some reason the next
generation picks up the idea and enlarges upon it.
Thus to-day you visualize your marvellous unfoldment;
and you shall visualize in coming generations the most
marvelous progress of mental unfoldment through this
Law of Spiritual Adherence. So the higher each individ
ual cultivates his mental energy through magnetic force
and directs it into proper channels, the more will be ac
complished by the train of his fellowmen; and the more
each one will leave behind him to his credit.
God has no other way to unfold these marvels than
through the medium of His worthy children. It is His
immortal way of progress, this Communion with the soul
of man and its Unfoldment, and is the EARTHLY PART
OF HIM; and in no way can the individual escape this
God-spark.
Some one who has formulated an independent idea may
be chorused as an Agnostic or Atheist, but if his plan has
been progressive and correct, he is sent on his way rejoic
ing by the DIRECTOR OVER ALL; and when he comes
"over here" he discovers that he has been just a Creative
Seedl and his business while on earth was to cultivate that
seed according to the plan laid down for him.
If he has refused to obey his Inner Voice that directed
him to make it flourish as his part of the God-evolution

of his duty when he comes "over here" and will have to

return to earth to fulfil his creative plan, and he may
have to grope his way about in the astral or cosmic plane
for a certain length of time —a dissatisfied soul!
But when he acquiesces in his "natural bent," a new life
unfolds itself to him! and this proves how important it is
to develop the INNER DESIRES, for they are the proper
desires for his natural progression, and also do their part
in Unfolding and Building up the Progressional Work of
the Creator.
"Over here" we have the natural viewpoint of Life Use
fulness and Service, and all is Love, Serenity, Purity and
Truth. The scientific relationships are all Clarified to us
as being "cause and effect" amid the Vastness of the
Scheme of Principles.
We merely return to you to help as we may as a matter
of duty and love, and we are overjoyed when we are rec
ognized and our efforts appreciated. Thus we bring to
other hearts progress and encouragement, and it is a Law
unto Ourselves that we fulfil our lives according to this
plan. We are not hurt by neglect; FOR ARE WE NOT
SERVANTS OF THE ALMIGHTY FULFILLING HIS
SPECIAL CAUSE?
TRUE TACT IS A HEAVENLY TRAIT, and when
applied in Relationship to one's Inner Thoughts it proves
vastly beneficial in all daily contacts. A gentle rejoinder,
a warm clasp is more soothing to the soul than one can
ever measure or realize. And the Cultivation of Personal
ity and Gentility is one's first key to success in regard to
the Law of Human Attraction.
You think it odd for me to speak thus, but this is our
trend of thought, as we leave all material things behind
us. It is also difficult for us to speak so that Humanity
comprehends, for it is much like talking to a kindergarten
class. We are ALL MIND, ALL LEARNING AND
ALL PROGRESS.

For instance, I could not analyze the rainbow to your
comprehension, except to say that it is illustrated entirely
in Velocity of Vibration. I SEEM TO HAVE LEFT
BEHIND MECHANICAL OR MATHEMATICAL
PRECISION OF LIGHT, AND WE JUST SEE IT AS
IT IS, and I could not even give it a physical analysis!
It is not gases, as you might like to define ethereal sub

CLASS OF ELECTRICITY OR PRECEPT OF ETHE
REAL FORCE!
Of course the Higher the Velocity, the Higher the
Color; and the arrangement of the colors remains fixed
because Velocity is a fixed principle according to the
Law of Gravity. Gravity in itself is a Hidden Law, and
can be defined in no other way, than that IT IS THE
IMMUTABLE POWER OF GOD, REALLY GOD
HIMSELF—PRIMARY POWER! And there is no in
tellect sufficiently advanced to "analyze gravity" no more
than I could in my experiments.
Magnetism centers toward the center of your earth,
and all things, to a certain extent, are pulled to the center ;
thus lighter objects fall toward the heavier. Yet there is
a "band of higher electric force" between your earth and
the moon and other planets, and this gravity force on its
outer edges meets a FORCE THAT PULLS THE
OTHER WAY, keeping the planets apart.
ELECTRICITY, if Scientifically Analyzed, IS THE
CREATIVE SPARK OF THE ACTUAL GOD-MIND,
builded into countless relationships of progressional up
building, and formulating all Visible and Invisible Struc

88 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
ELECTRICITY, strange to say, like all other issues has
developed from the Formulation of gases into solids. All
of your world is made up of ELECTRONS, and the
GREAT KNOWLEDGE, back of that building power,
Formulated all solidified forms as you visualize them.
AND THIS FORCE SHALL NEVER STOP BUILD
ING ! This POWER is Tireless and Endless. This is
provable to you as you recall the changes of Form in
the continents of past history: how new lands have sprung
up and others take on new shapes through the pulsating
of nature's relationships. Only the God-mind is back of
all this wonderful exhibition of power. HE IS ALL
THAT IS.
There are gravity forces that make your weather;
whenever velocity is great, your weather is clear; when
the velocity dulls, the weather becomes forceless. God
does not have complete control over weather, for it is a
"wild force of electricity" or a field of vibratory force
separate and apart. People who are dissatisfied with the
weather do not figure on the Negative Forces which are
always working against GOOD, and which can prevent
satisfactory conditions, strange to say. THESE FORCES
WERE BEFORE GOD, but, as in other principles, God
is slowly overcoming these negations, some of which are
hidden from mankind. Eventually the climate shall be
ruled just as God directs the Precision of the Flower or
the Stars in the Cosmos.
I could not say much about the sun-rays, except that
they are a cure for many ailments and will be more and
more applied to build up the body and strengthen its
resistance. The sun is a battery charger in itself. Of
course the individual electric cells of the body must fight
their own battles, but the sun has a great part to play
in giving new energy and strength.

limited according to its force of gravity. Some of these
branches have only weather conditions to handle and su
perintend. Others attend to the body-building of man
kind. Others vitalize the earth just as do the rays of
sunshine, by penetrating all growths of the earth, doing
their specific work; and they are WHOLLY RELA
TIONAL to their particular duty.
But the HIGHER FORM OF ELECTRICITY IS
GOD-PRESENCE, truly unveiled to mankind and
WHEREIN HE LIVES ENTIRELY WITHIN REACH
OF MAN'S PSYCHIC SENSES AT ALL TIMES,
BEING THE HIGHEST REALITY OF MANKIND!
Through cultivating this relationship, man may attain
any degree of God-mind he seeks for and accomplish un
accountable things—the seemingly impossible. He can
bring about the Realization of his Highest Ideals by Seek
ing the Aid of this power.
Electricity in its various forms is ENTIRELY RE
SPONSIBLE FOR ALL LIFE; and any decay means
a vacating of this vitalizing force. Blue mold for in
stance collects in darkened corners, because there is no
life vitalizing element vibrating there, proving that sun
shine is the generator of vigor; and VITALITY is lowest
in the darkest hours. To lack sunshine is to have a run
down battery!
Now I see your question : Will Edison complete a tele
phone by which the human may communicate with us on
this side? Now I believe that he can do so, for there
are no limits to electrical velocity and it needs but to be
harnessed; and I look for him to perfect a wireless in

tege—his under-study —will do so. This lad is a Marked

Tut, tut, my dear friend, Beecher, you should not
bring me along with such flattery. He who is worthy
of praise is the ONE that thought springs from—the
Power back of all accomplishment. I do not take the
credit to myself for my thoughts, for God works in a
mysterious way His marvels to perform.
But happy am I indeed to be here with you this bonny
morn. It reminds me of the spring mornings at Downs.
The fragrance of the air and the quietude of nature brings
serenity and comfort to the soul whether in or out of
the body. The beauties of nature are never lost to view,
and I have made of my continuing years a further study
of nature's progress.
There is no higher mission in life than the study of
the attributes of natural principles in all their countless
variations of creative action and practical utility.
Before I enter my subject, allow me the privilege of
setting the world aright concerning the DARWINIAN
THEORY OF EVOLUTION; for, not one instant had
I the slightest intention of unthroning the Almighty power
of the Creative Supreme Being over us all ! Nor for one
moment did I ever mention in my writings that man

power of narrow religionists be not thwarted. This mis
taken information regarding "Evolution" was spread, that
their ideas be further substantiated. My theory of
"Evolution" or nature's natural change, could not take
away one iota of credit from the UNSEEN POWER that
fashions all creation and all changes.
My statement that man grew out of nature's progres-
sional change is true! And in no way does this state
ment break down or destroy Biblical truths. If the
practical mind of the world would grasp TRUTH as
TRUTH and not construe facts according to artifice, my
books would be easily understood and prove the state
ments made in my works and Verified in God's Great
Handbook.
The great trouble with people regarding Bible study
is,
that the Scriptures are read and understood too literally!
This was excusable in the olden days when man had
such limited experiences, and came so little in contact with
true scientific research by which to prove his ideas, but
in this day the clearer vision

to the Fountainhead of all Creation, or the Beginning.

of imaginings and have true POWER OF MIND—the
vital human Soul-power which no one can deny. The
MIGHTY CREATIVE POWER, which is the basis of all
life, and to which we are accountable as to our own, is at
last becoming readily accepted IN ITS REAL STATUS
amongst mankind, and God is no longer placed upon a
pedestal afar off like a painted idol for man to revere.
The "author of life" is in daily contact with man, and
man knows that His true spirit dwelleth "within him."
And this fact should be kept foremost in mind in regard
to all creative issues. Man is never quite satisfied unless
he is investigating the Truth as to everything.
And Humanity are naturally doubting Thomases.
When an infant commences to talk is not almost his first
word "Why"? It is through this natural instinct that
your earth has become what you visualize it to be to-day;
of far more eminent spiritual evidence in accord with
practical ideals, than it was in the days of our forefathers,
who held tight to their opinions, and so little understood
the Truths of Nature, or even of God's Great Book.
To have an open mind, and a practical viewpoint on all
subjects of life-interest, is to steer one's life into such
interesting channels where the great discoveries of the
future lie.
Thus Natural Science is only an analytical, intelli
gent description of many stories repeated many times
over in the Bible. Individuals of that day and time had
an individually strange way of diction, and with the
flourishing of increased generations, the world has grown
away from any possible true interpretation of
it,
and much
of
it
has become lost meaning.
So humanity in their own feeble way grope and grasp

just as much as to-day all life is an open book built upon
the principles of natural factors.
With this viewpoint illustrated I trust that, from this
time onward, "Evolution and Theology" will be accepted
AS ONE PRINCIPLE, or as the STORY OF LIFE pro
ceeding adown the ages. This is rational, for all ma
terials must be collected before a model can be made,
and it has taken long ages of Collecting to gain sufficient
materials to Illustrate the TRUTH OF THE FOUN-
TAINHEAD OF LIFE and the PROXIMITY OF GOD
TO MAN.
And it shall take long ages to thoroughly verify More
Truths which are not now acceptable, although they bear
a sense of practicality and usefulness to man; but they
are now beginning to be noted. So before long new colors
shall be added to their relationships! There is one thing
however man cannot deny, strange to say, and that is
CHANGE, GROWTH and PROGRESS!
ALL OF LIFE IS GRADUAL UNFOLDMENT OF
THE HIGHER MIND! It began before the solidified
forms of life came into being, and "Creative Etheric Sub
stances" were evolved in space. Back of this Beginning
of Evolution or Change, there was an UNSEEN POWER.
The MIND OF MAN, however, did not dwell in this
source; therefore, the MIND OF MAN HAD TO
SPRING FROM BEYOND IT—otherwise it could not
have come into being.
I cannot define the FOUNTAINHEAD in a physical
way to you, for you have not yet evolved into a "spiritual
state of being," wherein the INVISIBLE FORCES ARE

THOUGHT-POWER, WHICH HAS A KNOWLEDGE
OF THE COSMOS as a whole.
That does not give you a very direct answer : but upon
entering into the "ethereal spheres" after leaving your
physical embodiment, you will clearly understand, that
every unit has, as such, a part to play in the work of
evolution or change, or progression; just as much a part
as God has. And that is what He has so patiently builded
man up for, and has so long planned as a pattern for
him: that he shall do a quota to help PROGRESSION!
DIVINITY IS EVOLUTION OR PROGRESS, SPIR
ITUALLY DIRECTED! The terrestrial body is no
other than an animal plant life, or one phase of natural
directorship in the sense of evolution —a natural cause.
However, the supernormal characteristics emanating from
the terrestrial body Verify that Evolution! GOD-
POWER—VIBRATION is everywhere, permeating solid
matter as well as the invisible ethereal power that sur
rounds that solid form!
It is Impossible in taking up the various Relationships
of the "study of life" in its growth, to LOSE SIGHT OF
THE CREATIVE POWER; nor are there any Agnostics
or Atheists in existence! This subnormal condition of
any mind but lives in the carnal, which is no part of the
Spiritual Creative System of Evolution.
A man should not be criticized for radical thought in
this direction, for the Offsprings of the Carnal Senses are
the NEGATIVE POWERS, which were in the very "be
ginning of creation" evidently as strong as they may
be considered to be at this time. But in no way do these
"opposing forces to good" belong to the ETHERIZED
CLASSIFICATIONS OF EVOLUTION'S GROWTH.
In nature's realm, the Negative Forces or Powers,
which tear down and destroy, are the Opponents of
GOOD—the Satanic Opposites of GOOD. And this IN

DIRECT FORCE shall never be mastered properly, until
MAN TAKES GOD'S PART AND UNDERSTANDS,
THAT GOD IS WITHIN HIS BOSOM and would direct
his Progress correctly, if he would but listen to His voice.
Then man would understand the science and unfold-
ment of education and endeavor to overcome that negative
power, which is unessential and detrimental to man. This
shows that in nature also there is a DUAL PERSO
NALITY! In all causes and effects there are oppo-
sites, and from the "beginning of creation" there has been
a Controversy between the GOOD and the BAD.
In the Mental-mortal world there is no excuse for man
not to conquer this dual opposing force, and to magnify
its progressional attributes. And only by doing so may
man SPIRITUALLY INVOLVE HIMSELF IN GOOD,
and be prepared for the next Transition!
Life has been changing in form and color for countless
eons of time, beginning with the tiny cell which scientists
have analyzed and called protoplasm, pervading the
waters which surrounded the spheres from which all life
sprang: passing through various stages of life under those
waters. And it is just as true that man evoluted out of
the water as to say that the animal kingdom so evoluted.
ONE MUST GO BACK TO THE SOURCE OF ALL
THINGS.
As the ages of progressional powers existed and per
sisted in their particular forms, queer creatures crawled
out of the sea on to what had become a solidified form of
earth, and through the intermixing and intermingling of
chemicals, the earth gradually appeared. Thus the oceans
gave up some life to earth direction that it might extend
the growth of evolution.
These queer species of half-fish and half-serpent are
no where to be found in archeologist's records, for their

and ages of earth formation to prove the truth of this
statement. Yet from a tiny cell of protoplasm grew the
fish, and then a serpent half fish and half serpent.
Weather conditions of nature changed the contour and
form of life of the time, and then came another great
age; and now I go back again to another branch of the
serpent species which, through its contact with the outer
conditions of nature, took on the animal shape of other
species. At this period there were two distinct species:
the serpent and the animal.
The Almighty power evidently had reason for putting
down these animal and serpent monsters through an Ice
Age, because they were too powerful for the good of
the other growths of earth.
In the animal age certain species formed and carried on
the genealogy through the escape of certain of their mem
bers from the Ice Age, some of the animals fleeing from
the dangerous places into new fields; and this is why all
life was not rendered extinct at that time.
There were countless species which variated, from con
tact one with another, until man came into being. There
was a distinct species of animal which resembled the
chimpanzee and the monkey family of to-day, which were
very prevalent and monarchs of the lower animals. They
came not from the chimpanzee or monkey family, BUT
WERE ALWAYS A TRUE LINEAGE OF THEIR
OWN from the first cell of creation.
They bore all the instincts of past ancestries and
through their search for sustenance gradually learned or
became more intelligent. Their wing or offspring, through
some freak of nature which even a spirit cannot define,
did not advance mentally, except to a limited qualification.
Thus the various stages of animal kingdom remain as one
visualizes them to-day. Yet, invisibly, the animal king

bring about a domestic state in the wild animal kingdom.
Eventually certain species of animals shall develop
souls, as your domestic animals have unfolded in their
regime of life, your dogs, cats and horses. So this system
will be applied also to certain wild animals of the jungles.
Through nature's contact they are slowly losing their
fear and acquiring a higher intelligence, which will make
them unharmful to man.
ANIMALS THINK THROUGH THEIR GLANDS.
They have a systematical gland thinking capacity which
shall develop new instincts as they prevail in their spe
cial patterns. And I may add that education in all chan
nels from the lowest animal form has arisen from the
fear instinct !
If the lower animals had not feared the more majestic
animals, they would not have ventured to think of ways
of escape, and this is a step toward education. This is
demonstrated by the training of wild animals in circuses
which are trained through fear. And man came up
through this same channel until he proved capable of
directing his own capabilities in natural course of events.
Stationed in a particular pattern, he began to under
stand his own mind and thought—without a prodding
fear, wherein Consciousness as Oneness with "divine
principle" manifested itself. So at last man has arrived
where he is beginning to see light beyond his doubts and
fears; and to know that he is a creative quota of evolu
tion, representing divinity of life far superior to life of
the spheres beneath him, or the animal status of direction.
No one, however, is justified to feel that he is superior
to any other channel of evolution, for all are the em-
bodimental power of the Creator; and every one is as Es
sential to Progress as any other.

OF ALL CREATION AND CREATIVE INSTINCT.
And just where a limit may be drawn, even We, in this
Relationship of Higher Life, see no Beginning and no
Ending to Life's Evolutive or Religious Course.
And one human is just as essential to life as another,
nor can one exist without the other. The religious,
theoretical, analytical trend of mind is also GOD PRIN
CIPLE. The scientific relationships of life are the prin
ciples relating to the terrestrial body, or outer creation of
man. Both are intelligent research. The one is essential
and needful to the other. No one can separate these prin
ciples and be successful in research.
After all, the divine instinct of all life is to find Con
solation in Learning, Contentment of Soul in Truth, and
Happiness in a spirit of knowledge.
And here I go back again to the beginning of every
thing, SCIENTIFICALLY NAMING GOD AS THE
ALL CREATIVE VIBRATORY FORCE! And this
analysis does not in any way break down any proper
meaning of your traditions and doctrines. Man chooses
to endow a principle with a practical sense of Vibratory
Freedom. Man would have all of life's Spiritual Emotions
directed in imaginary phases: action, movement, ad
herence of one cell to another, knowledge above the direc
tion of its particular pattern. Can anyone deny this
Fallacy of mankind?
A drop of water is NEVER WASTED; nor can one
grain of sand go astray for it is returned to its field of use
fulness and is regenerated and brought back into a
stronger and more useful structure. And thus your earth
has all been builded through countless ages by MEANS
OF THIS SAME VIBRATORY SYSTEM OF "ELEC
TRICAL ADHERENCE"— one principle to another.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY IOI
The Bible student would say the Darwinian was trying
to make a mechanical God of Electricity, but he would
be far from telling the Truth, nor does he see Truths
before his eyes. All etheric force if analyzed by the
scientists of the day is found to be made of COUNTLESS
ELECTRONS; and thus ALL LIFE HAS CULMI
NATED IN ELECTRIFIED FORCE.
It is the only power which CONSTRUCTS AND
BUILDS AND PRODUCES ALL THINGS ! And there
is a constitutional change in the nature of whatever this
vitalized form of power vacates, —be it flesh and blood, or
the heart of a tree, decay, disintegration and mildew at
tack its vitals as a result of the lack of this ethereal
force.
Man has become so divinely intelligent, that he is now
able to harness and control this vital energy and power,
or shall we call it GOD-MIND, coming to his help, for
it is the ALL IN ALL OF LIFE when directed in proper
relationships. True, it may be USED for destruction by
Satan's agents or for construction by God's children: for
bad, or for good, as man directs.
So I would ask each worthy unit on earth of thinking
equilibrium to study closely the phenomena and the
resultant issues of this vital energy or spiritual power
pervading the universes; this ELECTRIFIED SER
VANT OF GOD, working in oneness with man and in
daily contact, hand in hand with him.
And man's Reverence for all this, and his Gratitude,
which "Constitutes his Religion," shall never fall away,
but shall grow wider and deeper and broader in true
brotherhood with God; and it shall more and more be
come a practical working partnership, wherein no man
shall be satisfied without a great percentage of knowledge
to properly guide his terrestrial body to higher shores.

guardians of religious wisdom, and have had the con
tinuity of mind to substantiate the true state of affairs,
and God's close brotherhood with the soul of man.
Scientific progress must keep apace with RELIGION,
and RELIGION must keep side by side with SCIENCE
and its unfoldments under man's intuition. And to-day,
of all days (Edison's 83d birthday, February nth, 1930),
we pay the greatest tribute to him who has unfolded life
in the highest degree to mankind.
Thomas A. Edison has been the scientific saviour of the
world, and to-day he has been evident in this life eighty-
three years. Such geniuses as he come direct and pro
ject their works from the "fountainhead of all wisdom."
Back in Washington's time such geniuses would have
perished through the domineering of tyrants, because of
their ignorant fears and superstitions.
In your time our friend William Jennings Bryan be
came obsessed in opinionated ideas. Thinking inces
santly upon one subject does not make of it a truth except
to the individual who is so intoxicated with his own view
point. This is not to be critical of Mr. Bryan, for he
thought his own mind to be authenticated, and was de
termined not to change it.
As we see
it,
it
was merely
a
case of—one might call it
stubbornness—or not wishing to see and adjust his truths.
Perhaps he never fully realized matters until he came
"over here" into this new life, for his opinions had be
come so real to him. Too, he had
a
reason to verify his
opinions, for he wished thus to substantiate his name
adown the ages of history, and his opposition to "Evolu
tion" which he refused to study, was his life theme.
Inwardly, William Jennings Bryan had an urge to
bring forth his opinions to the world and he found there
an opportunity. And this

ished in any way in the hereafter because he had this par
ticular fallacy about apparent truths. He merely had to
thrash the subject out "over here," and now he is of
normal thinking capacity along practical relationships —
just as other spiritual forms have "come down to earth"
so to speak, and discovered the true and practical God,
right at their elbow.
To us, this vital, vibrating, energetic force, in Oneness
with all things, is patent throughout all nature, working
to define the multifarious wonders in their particular pat
tern, that we marvel that it is necessary for any mind to
be taught anything so obvious.
Now I just want to say a word on the question of mar
riage in regard to the origin of species. The true marriage
is between "spirit only" which means spiritual true love,
anything in another relation being carnal only. If the
carnal mating does not separate in earth life it will do so
here, for it is an unnatural emotion, not true to nature.
There must be Companionate Force of Mind-power where
two souls commingle as one.
Mismatings are entirely the work of man and occur
through mismanagement of the physical concepts of life.
Thus I wish to definitely state that mortality should be
more precise in the Union of their Spirits in the interests
of futurity.
Emma, my wife, and I were truly mated. There was
never a question in regard to our companionate force, for
we thought the same thoughts and lived the same life.
It is getting out of one's orbit of companionate thought
that causes so many disasters. One must have a Spiritual
Understanding as well as terrestrial comforts and ad-
herences, to be happily paired.
And while I am on this subject I wish to touch upon a
question so oft discussed concerning wedlock between

we bore seven beautiful children, of clear thinking, fault
less in structure, and with healthy red blood, and dating
back through both sides of our family, cousins had mar
ried cousins.
Tut, tut! Let no thought of fear enter the mind on this
subject in regard to this blood tie, for all depends upon
whether there is low mentality or unvitalized blood, which
is bad in any case. I am not advocating this sort of
marriages, but unless individuals are physically unfit there
is no danger.
Now you ask about the Negative Force of Nature.
This force is a specific "power of nature," just as the car
nal mind exists in man—which never adheres to spiritual
relations, but is separate, apart and opposing—a positive
oppositional force to Divinity —working in opposite di
rection; and it has taken all these ages for mankind to
realize, that this force is unnecessary to their lives' trend,
but that it branched off into coarseness and lewdness.
What is it for? Well, it sometimes takes negative
powers to break down EVIL itself and bring it into the
Understanding of GOOD. "Over here," EVIL is so
EVIL, that when man gets into it for punishment, he is
well glad to get out of it and never wants to see it again.
In this case it is a necessary evil; and it has existed long
before the intelligence which you call the Supreme Being,
arose and began to formulate life in a pattern for GOOD,
as you visualize the beauties of earth at this time.
Satan's realms for the punishment of consciences as
they come "over here" are composed entirely of Negative
Force, for he is a negative principle. And if I have come
here for no other reason than to explain this principle, I
would ask all humanity to avoid the negative path.

but NATURAL CHANGE, DIVINE VITALITY:

sage to you, but would rather wish for you to endeavor
to comprehend my thoughts through VIBRATION.
Yes, the tapers are extinguished —the tapers that only
faintly illuminated the darkness and doubts of ye olden
times, and the light of wisdom is entering—even into the
homes of modern times —thank the good God; and I come
as one of heaven's hosts to sponsor a WORK OF LOVE
FOR MANKIND'S BETTERMENT; to help release
humanity from manmade traditions and superstitions.
Could I visualize myself to you, you would see a strange
little man—seemingly from another land—for his phys
ique would appear different from the manly physique
of to-day —having a weak, crumpled body, short legs,
long arms, and a large cranium. Few individuals to-day
need to have their hats made to order as did Immanuel
Kant.
The jokers of my day said that Immanuel Kant, who
suffered much from headaches, must have large headaches
in the space of his hat, much as the giraffe or camel
would suffer from a long sore throat. Yea. Indeed. The
headaches of yore were the "mistakes of life," and believ
ing too much in MATERIA MEDICA.
But when Immanuel Kant grew into manhood he
learned that God, the Supreme Being, was the one great
physician that man needed. The heart, the lungs and
digestive organs are the boiler of the body, and the brain
is the locomotive. Thought is combustion. Deep breath
ing and fresh air are the means of longevity. Most men
die from shortness of breath—literally—for that is their
God-energy; and he who starves his body in life for
ozone commits slow suicide.

clocks by him? This was to save paying doctors, and
was the whim and way of olden times. Flowers that are
encased without air, soon perish. If they are on the bush,
swinging in the breeze, they are under God's care to the
end.
While I give this strange wisdom of Immanuel Kant, I
bring to your notice another strange fact. Once this little
man was seen peeking through a keyhole into a beautiful
garden that had great wide spaces, and the wayfarers
laughed at him. One young starling could not stand his
queer antics, and said: "Why do you do that?" What
did I answer? "Go on, you fool, I am studying the law
of optics." For anything seen from a minute standpoint
is far more realistic than anything taking in a wide scope,
and it was ever my ideal to go back to the Source of all
things. When looking at an object I saw that and noth
ing else. If the individuals of to-day would but gaze at
an object for its "particular beauty" and all the charm
surrounding
it,
they would have
a
keener perception of
its individual principle.
To study INDIVIDUALITY IS TO RECOGNIZE
THE GREATNESS OF THE GOD-MIND.

still I remember the queer stench I carried in my nostrils.
Some days I could ne'er eat a bite for his soaking a hide
near the larder; and my dear, patient mother, with her
frilled cap and hand embroidered apron, told me to go
outside and said, "Go smell the flowers till father com
pletes the work that brings you bread and butter."
And the butter was so pure in those days, and life in
the little village was so pure likewise. Harmony lived
in "love interests for others" —not through curiosity but
through human interest and sincerity. The history of
one's neighbor was imbedded in the heart—from no "uni
versal standpoint" —but from moral phases taken from
the home setting as examples; these object lessons bene
fited all who saw and heard them for ever.
Man lived not in a quandary of spirit in that imme
diate locale, but in the good measure of faith and hope;
and the simple life was "all of life" in the little city; and
thus was the start of Immanuel Kant.
My parents realized my weakness, and for years they
struggled to keep life in the crumpled body. Mother said,
"His head is large—it is full of something. We shall yet
find its contents. He is not strong and cannot work in
the garden nor mow hay. We will train him for the
clergy!" Thus I was given the opportunity of schooling
when my brothers and sisters worked about the home —
some knitting, some shining the pewter; others working
in the garden; some taking fattier 's leather goods to
market, while I sat in state in my chimney corner with
my Latin.
And that chimney corner was my shrine! Shall I de
scribe it? An octagon shaped stone affair coming down
through the middle of the home, with an aperture within
it large enough for half a dozen people to stand upright.
The andirons and all utilities therefor were all made of
brass. Pots were of pewter, and we burned ashen logs.

And as the flames escaped up its big generous throat
faces came to me from the reflections, and voices spoke
to my soul. Teachers and hosts of intellectuals sur
rounded me, and my imagination was my university.
The university of life is only the "setting for the play,"
and thus the setting of Immanuel Kant is depicted.
Out of this Imaginary Reality I learned the wisdom of
life, and that MIND was all there is to man of lasting
quality. As I grew older, I was placed in the clergy; and
I taught a few hearers in little dull hallways, where all
was cold and clammy. Religion was strictly limited by
paid preachers, and they preached only what the people
wished to hear. I preached what the people did not want
to hear, and thus I could not choose a background for my
services, so I was glad to accept any corner in which to
stand and give out my ideas as to the universal light of
knowledge and truth.
But the truth is always unpopular, because the world
at large seldom tells nor wishes to hear the truth. I
wished to confer upon all who lived the teachings of Im
manuel Kant, and thus I found the clergyship disap
pointing. I had to stand on a box behind my pulpit to
give the people the assurance that I was sophisticated —
also to hide my insignificance! My size was such that
I felt this was pretense, or putting out more outward
show than truth in respect to my thoughts.
I wondered, "Why should I stand and tell people about
God, when I knew so little of the real truth about him?"
My training even was limited as I later realized, and thus
I gave up the "clergy idea" —largely for the reason, that
I found, that to be favored in earth life, man must preach
just what his people demanded. Was it not a "doctrine
of mercy" for the contributors —and "hell and damna
tion" for those "who could not give"?
Yea. And I believed that all people should be made

HIS OWN PLAN FOR THEM! that he was no unjust
respecter of persons. So back I went to my chimney
corner and finally obtained a position as teacher. For
many years I taught, trying to convey to the world the
answer to three questions: what was I? Who was I?
What was I planned to be?
And I think these questions were answered for me in
technical terms of little understanding: but back of these
answers GOD'S FACE SHONE THROUGH.
I challenge any one to read the works of Immanuel
Kant, especially the "Critique of Pure Reason" not to
find, that sarcasm but tells the bitter truth about man
kind, and the fallacy of all its false pretenses —Man has
but to be true to himself, and God will be true to him!

said, Great Goodness, what a thrill to come unto your
sphere. It seems I am almost human again. And he
went right along:)
I have never lost touch with humanity, and have
watched life greatly unfold just as one watches the un-
foldment of a flower. And it is most interesting to me
to look into and read the minds and consciousnesses of
personalities, for there is now more unfoldment of orig
inality and good thought than has ever before come into
view.
Man is becoming acquainted with his "spiritual
powers," and as he becomes more and more so, he will
find material life to have less and less importance and
influence over life. The birth of PSYCHOLOGY is the

touch. In my lifetime I used this as the means of re
covering from discomfort in my bodily structure. Im-
manuel Kant was considered somewhat unbalanced men
tally, also, when he affirmed to himself: "I am so com
fortable. I am so comfortable," when all could see that
I was anything but comfortable in my distorted body and
overworked brain. And I would affirm that in my opin
ion one must have a master mind to overcome all ob
stacles.
Conditions may seem perfectly obvious to others, yet
when one's soul rules and governs the mind—there is no
pain! Pain is a thing entirely apart from the body. So
I wish all would study this science and form of thought,
first taking up the study of ruling by means of the Master
MIND making mental suggestion to the body. Christian
Scientists practice this though it is but little understood.
It is the science through which all divine masters con
quer by a healing touch laid upon the body of the af
flicted.
So little doth man know regarding the God-man within
him, that I am tempted to tell you of my experience dur
ing my years of tutorship. I taught the most intricate
details regarding geography, yet my body had never
traveled far from home. This was a standing joke
amongst the neighbors: the strange ideas that Immanuel
Kant had about staying closely at home.
But it was not necessary that the hulk of my body
move and be more uncomfortable in strange places that
my mind might acquire information: for I acquired the
art of sending my Spirit out into space —and this is di
vinely possible to all children of God.

miles seeing the contour of foreign lands and bringing
descriptions back for me to memorise.
I drew perfect maps, setting in all details which my
physical eyes had never seen, nor had I textbooks. And
thus you have the true answer to my ability. And it is
eminently possible, that more knowledge can be gained
through this "quest of the spirit" than through seeking
the material solution of any problems.
People of India and of Egypt have long exercised this
faculty, and are prone to describe places their physical
eyes have never seen ; and there is really no mystery about
this gift of God, for all men shall eventually learn this
secret and then they will have the key to true knowledge:
when once souls are thus developed they can undermine
the domination of physical concepts.
Now what is my concept of life after death? That
there is no Litigation in God's estate! ALL OF CREA
TION IS MENTAL, and Thought is the Reaction of how
one contemplates life. Each individual forms his own
surroundings according to his thought forms. There is
no time or space, separate from thought; and if there is
no ear to hear sounds —thought has no power to grasp
that which is called VIBRATION.
VIBRATION exists, and is the ORIGINAL POWER,
which no human being, nor spirit entity may fully ana
lyze. Man is limited according to the strength and power
of his mental faculties. If he has no eye to see beauty—
he sees none ! If he hath no ear to hear the music of
nature—he heareth not! If he has no mental ability—
he speaks not clearly nor beautifully; and such men think
life a quandary with no material solution!
This is because they depend upon that which is
tangible and come to this point from over development
of the physical issues of life, wrought through man's con
temporaneous range of action and thought.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY "3
"Simplicity of spirit" at the very beginning of life
would have directed men altogether differently had not
men construed a physical fallacious God—capable of evil
doings—just as a man might be individual in his own
sophistications.
Thus man early arrives at a point where he finds a
precipice —or void—where he is afraid to step further,
and balances himself on the "rock of salvation." Instead
of leaving the deeper questions of life to his spiritual field
of scientific research, he starts a laboratory within him
self to try and analyze the whys and wherefores of all
things.
It has been but a short time since we could look down
upon a Superman. In past history only few men have
been superconscious of their own spirit to the extent that
they could control their faculties by spiritual means and
make a display of this. Teachers walked on quicksands
during the life of Immanuel Kant, and taught, according
to law and regulations, the fixed standards of church and
government.
But to-day the teacher who cannot come forth with
new and original thought, soon loses influence and falls
behind into the mass of commonplaceness. The world
to-day is looking up to the "scientific thinker" as their
salvation.
Years ago the world looked up to the preacher of their
parish for the light of all life. Now, is it a Sin for Science
to be introduced in the churches? Nay, nay, my good
children! This should have been done many centuries
ago, for the soul is the seat of science, the TANGIBLE
OF LIFE, and needs Scientific Analysis; but it is not to
be analyzed through material ideals and fabled lore.
The scientific ideals of Immanuel Kant were little com
prehended in his day and time, and my reason for leaving
the pulpit and teaching was to learn! To Learn is to be

come a teacher and learn to Understand Principles to
Expound, for it opens up constantly new vistas of knowl
edge. A teacher must apply new science to all things and
gradually abandon the old and useless tenets.
A preacher must abandon the old and antiquated ideals
of his text books which benefited times and thought when
ignorance and superstition reigned. But the time shall
come when only the preacher who delves into ethics and
science shall hold his post in the future. The jack-in-the-
pulpit preacher of ye olden times is becoming as obsolete
as his tenets, which will become a faded memory.
Our little church in Konigsberg had two holes in its
wall through which a curate stuck his head and bellowed
forth the past catastrophes of ancient times. And an
assistant curate stuck his head out of the wall below the
other to verify his appalling statements. Then the or
ganist would play in low moans —and down we all went
on the flagstones to pray that such calamities ne'er befall
our ways.
The low tones of the organ represented the supposed
thundering voice of God, wrathful at a world full of sin.
I can yet see that high structure of plastered walls; built
of sun-dried bricks with thatched roof. The sunlight
fell through the high spire so beautifully, and this was a
haven for the sparrows who were happy on the top of
the church —and we so miserable at the bottom! They
lived naturally and truthfully in the freedom of God's
love.
But, Aye! Ayel The fictitious nature of people who
so loved theatricals in the display of God's word! IN
DEED IT WAS A TRAGEDY TO BE RELIGIOUS!
It was to enshroud one's soul and turn it away from the
true God, and only to cherish it in secret as a pearl of
great price, rather than let the sunshine of God's open
book fall upon it.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
It was no unusual reality for many people to remain
upon their knees on the flags in prayer all night, when the
curates predicted a deluge of sin that might fall upon
the world at any time. And they moaned about the souls
yet unborn —only to wear the skin off their bony knees —
many being so crippled that they could not work their
gardens for many days.
Every home was a manufacturing center, and all had
their labors to do in order to exist. However, there were
no neighborhood quarrels, and one always divided with
another. What one was unable to manufacture, he ex
changed for something he had not the capacity to acquire.
And again there shall come a time when labor shall be
a pleasure and self-indulgence a bore! Christ expected
men to work by the sweat of their brows, and the time
must come when there will be more "mental equality"
and a genuine honest course of reasoning under spiritual
guidance.
Then there shall not be covetousness or malice as an
aftermath of inequality. All shall be mentally sufficient
to carry on successfully as a righteous unit for God.
I live in the spiritual realm about the planet Orion,
where All IS LOVE. A thought or desire for anything
belonging to another is unheard of, for all have grown to
mental equality and share equally in the good things of
the spirit needs. And it is the plan of the GREAT AL
MIGHTY INVISIBLE CREATIVE SPIRIT that,
SPIRITUALITY shall be equalized throughout His king
dom. This will apply happiness and prosperity to the
extent where principles of life are not considered a luxury.
All reasonable things shall be inherited by the poor, and
they shall have a rich consciousness, and an intelligence
through which their own endeavors will enable them to
acquire all necessities. Thus the world will constitute a

high degree of prosperity, and poverty shall be past his
tory.
Religion shall not be dependent on the pocketbook nor
the narrowness of ignorant minds. A time shall come
when all preachers shall be paid, not through sacrifices
from their parishes, but from a special fund set aside by
the government to convey suitable expenses. Then peo
ple will choose their own churches rather than squander
their shillings in doubtful light philanderings.
Nowadays the burdens fall on the few, and the masses
of the shifty profit without applying their shoulders to
the wheel. In our day, too, it sapped out the lifeblood
of the producers in the parish. The sexton came every
morning for his coppers and they had to be given no
matter whether food was in the house or not. However,
they were given with a heart full of gladness for the peo
ple felt that ill would befall them otherwise.
Those unable to contribute were shunned because they
seemingly had not the intelligent power to get the coppers
for the church. Our Pietism was a leaning toward Uni-
tarianism, a belief in the supreme power of God. We
decidedly believed in Jesus because He taught this truth.
Now as I close I leave this message to my fellowmen:
THAT RELIGION IS THE UTMOST ESSENTIAL
TO ALL LIFE! He who bars out this NECTAR OF
THE GODS of the great universal kingdom, as the main
sustenance for his soul cannot suffice in any kingdom —
material or spiritual!
Eventually man shall see his shortcomings! It may
take decades for him to work his way through past Wind
ings and obscenities, but he will do it.
Our little sphere of light and love is as natural as your
own little town. We have streets and homes, but there
is no noise or clatter; all is serene and restful. There are

Yes. And I find it so pleasureable to imbue people with
my thoughts since science is so opening up minds. I am

for many years I have lived in this "new realm of hap
piness"; and the different ideals I followed in my years
of earthly contour matter little now—for LIFE is Opened
up before me in Reality.
I was born in Danzig, according to your time, in 1788.
I may call this fact a "world event," yet little was it real
ized at the time, that a German philosopher had appeared
on the stage to germinate and perpetuate ethics of mind
principles in the study of philosophy. But I was destined
to nurture a seed of wisdom just as others had done be
fore me.
It is a strange reality of natural law, that every eighty
years, there comes to prominence a philosopher destined
to add to the PLANT OF WISDOM a GROWTH not
theretofore known. During my lifetime there appeared
another and "greater reasoner," one whom I had the
pleasure of calling "friend" —the Sage of Weimar —
Johann von Goethe.
Ah, the pleasant hours we spent together discussing the
fundamental principles of various ethics, and endeavor
ing to lay a Foundation for men to follow wisely. And
yet, after all the wisdom that has been unfolded —Igno
rance reigns largely over the earth like a blight.
Had your radio existed in our day and time! Ah, my
friends, what accomplishments might we not have im
printed into minds! Our voices would have penetrated
afar instead of being cramped up on limited bookshelves
which the eyes of the reading public, under financial
stress, rarely penetrated.
The daily grind of life at that time, and the inacces
sibility of reading matter, led few to take Philosophy
seriously. In my time books were thought to be the
pastime of the idle or the wealthy; but to-day the phi
losopher's gifts to mankind are easily distributed. Espe

daily since Psychology has been brought intimately into
life as essential to success.
How many, many beautiful minds are there not "over
here" and all are united in one mass movement toward
developing what God plans to be an "Intellectual Age" on
your earth, regardless of man's present economic stand
ing, through the Essence of VIBRATION— through the
Development of the "supernormal nerve constituency."
Through nature's growth —every human shall yet be just
as receptive to higher and better thought, as he now is
to Dollars and cents, with which he buys the printed word
of the philosopher.
Intelligent Reality is to-day becoming a Universal Real
ity; not something vague in the soul of men. In my
time education was a rare and a marked privilege. Only
those who had means and ample time spent their days in
systematic study; and these were considered equal to
those with divine gifts.
They who had to work by the sweat of their brow were
thought to step on forbidden ground if they but peered
into a book or entered the realm of higher thought. It
was not considered necessary, for men to adapt their
minds to the realm in which they thought themselves
destined to live.
Animal strength ruled; and the man who could grasp
higher thought was believed to be gifted by the gods.
How little they knew, that by the ethics of natural law,
this privilege is given equally to each and all of God's
children; that it was the privilege at that time of every
individual to have and enjoy intelligently the gifts of
Deity.
But no; this was never taken into consideration, as even
the plowman comprehends in this day. In my time there
was strict classification of individuals. If a man grew

know more of higher knowledge—in fact it seemed useless
for his daily expression. He took his station for granted
as being in a predestined course.
Thus man made little endeavor to climb socially or
economically. If he was planted in a certain groove of
life expression, he felt satisfied that this was his portion
of duty to Jehovah. Have you not heard the individual
say, "It is my destiny to do such and such"?
Ah, beloved! All depends on the WILL TO DO; the
Determination to climb higher and higher! In this law
of God dwells the Eternal Mind and the Knowledge, that
Working along SPIRITUAL LINES, man's mind may
equal the God-mind! Remember, GOD MAKES NO
LIMITATIONS!
When humanity as a whole reach this "divine aspect of
TRUTH" and Acknowledge their own "mental heritage"
—so-called "death" shall possess no horrors. Never
imagine there is an end to life ! LIMITATION, as placed
by men, is the only stumbling block over which humanity
have to climb.
This is due to ancient tradition laid down by the un
developed, ignorant minds of our forefathers; as well as
to the instinct of imitation which is a natural heritage
of humanity from previous lives lived by them. But it
is also Natural Instinct so that God's perfect pattern for
man should not be an abortion.
Imitation is easily directed amiss through the drawing
of a Negative Pattern, rather, than the true one made
under natural law. But, beloved, remember: the God-
mind never moves its lines one iota from its true orbit of
expression. It is the Negative Mind of man that draws
the crooked, zigzag lines pertaining to life's ideals.
The two-way thinker is responsible for the shattered
ideals of God-mind; but over in our plane of expression
there are no "two-way thinkers"! All have a direct

plan of SPIRITUAL PROGRESSION and UNFOLD-
MENT—WHEREIN GOD PRESIDES; and our minds
are so fixed along the principle of living according to the
proper Soul Aspiration, that no reflection of evil is pos
sible.
No erroneous picture arises whereby one can draw
away from the natural "spiritual orbit" of thought and
action. I may give one great key for the perfecting of
THOUGHT, and that is to CULTIVATE THE WILL
TO LISTEN TO THE ADVICE OF THE INNER
SPIRITUAL MAN, and obey this DIVINE INTUI
TION which dwells within every man. It is the GOD-
SPARK OF LIFE: a part of the UNIVERSAL MIND!
This voice directs man into the Glory and the Pos
sibilities of NATURAL LAW wherein the soul shows its
superiority of direction over life lived under material
control. And when the soul of man controls his being, it
is evidenced by the Radiance of his countenance and the
Exhilaration of his mental direction —the Energy of his
body—by the Fineness of his Spirit as visualized in his
makeup and deportment in all things, great or small.
There is also a Keenness of Perception —a Vastness of
the Mind akin to the GREAT GOD-UNIVERSE—a
natural Directness of Purpose, like that Evident in the
God-spirit of Creation! These attributes spring up and
do their work unconsciously when the Soul or SPIRIT
UAL BODY PREDOMINATES in the Management of
the man.
So, my friends, it is the highest duty of life TO
TEACH the SOUL TO PREDOMINATE THE PHYSI
CAL MAN; and it is a greater duty than learning any
ethics of material life. Deny not the "inevitable law"
which you see depicted everywhere. Know, that it is

Beauty of the countenance.
We picture ourselves to you as we wish, for we are
able to flash the reflection of a mind memory upon your
brain. But our natural form is uniform; only the face
and hands are visible. The rest of our form is "ether
ized substance." Our height and size are apparent, but
the garment we wear represents a very fine, one may say
chiffon, floating, and taking on the color of "etherized
space"— which is VIBRATION.
The mind itself vibrates color, and the color depends
upon the personality. The more we progress, the paler
the color becomes, until finally it blends into "pure
white." We really consist of what man BREATHES;
it is the same substance, and is the VIBRATIVE GOD.
GOD is the very essence of all life!
If this infallible energetic force were shut out from
life, everything would crumble and fall to dust. As long
as this God-energy— or UNIVERSAL FORCE is not
barred out through Limitation—it expresses itself as the

CANNOT AFFECT IT! For it has been born in a like
ness of God-spirit, pure and undefiled. One may never
say that a man's soul is soiled, for it cannot be stained!
It is man's safety valve, born in God-cleansed purity; but
having been encased in different forms of men, or physical
growths, it uses material gleaned in accord with its
planned pattern, until finally—under God's great system
of management— it OUTGROWS ALL NUCLEI; and
finds itself back as a Development of the God-center of

Then it goes on into the HIGHER LIFE and REALM
OF THOUGHT that no Human may Encompass! And
even if at some time a man has been evil—the GOOD
PART OF HIS SOUL IS NEVER SCARRED, and car

EVIL is taken care of in INDIVIDUAL FORM.
No man is ever born without a Good Soul ! It may be
buried deep under material concepts or that which the
physical man has bound around his soul and thereby
smothered its purpose ; but the physical man soon perishes
—as David sings —"In his own iniquity," and his Soul
is freed; the God-impart being pure—"immediately
escapes" and departs to its own realm. But there are
evil Spirits, also, and these are cared for by a SYSTEM
OF NATURAL LAW!
Why Evil exists is no fault of the great God-principle.
Evil is altogether "artificial thought" and has no business
to exist, for man creates it himself! I wish man could
carry in his mind the truth that Evil is all Fictitious, and
no real part of the God-mind. But the real mind or soul
is smothered under it and cannot express its inherent

we analyze have not the slightest perception of their
"pure spirit," and that is why they go through life aim
lessly and listlessly.
Thanks to the great ALMIGHTY MIND, this is no
weakness of "our life over here." LIFE TO US IS A
SERIOUS MATTER, for the GOD-SPIRIT is our
FOREMOST MOTIVE IN ALL PRINCIPLES. All
principles are as an open book, available for knowledge.
There are two classes of Energetic MINDS; first, the
MIND wrapped up in commercial interest; this being the
mind that breaks and suffers the consequences of material
living. The other is the commercial mind that does not
lose sight of its source, and has the SPIRITUAL
ENERGY as its Backbone. This mind makes of its com
mercial and economical grasp something glorifying on
earth—worthy of its mental direction.
There are two kinds of mental fatigue; one is due to
the absorption of the negative forces of life, the arguing,
opposing force, which tears down God's constructive
plan. The other is the affirmative force which never
destroys—but the physical structure resents its load, if
overdone. But this physical force has nothing to do with
Restricting the Reception of GOD-KNOWLEDGE.
Man can absorb only a certain amount of mental stress

in accord with his limited bodily capacity; if too much he
overloads his storage batteries of vibratory reception;
however the MENTAL EFFORT OF SPIRITUAL
STUDY NEVER TIRES! It is the physical relation
alone that fatigues and destroys bodily cells. Man being
born with the God-spark or soul, within, it is perfectly
natural for him to express his daily acts according to the
Divine Impart, unless he allows the Negative Satanic-
force to rule him.
When the divine principle is uppermost in man, there
is no fatigue, but when THOUGHT OF THE SELF is
placed foremost, fatigue ensues.
I enjoy exceedingly going into the study of him whom
you call "Father Behr" for the reason, that we have al
ways been close friends, since the days of Goethe. The
reason Herman Behr is not a world-widely known philos
opher is because sometimes men are born back to earth
in a state of mental relaxation, which is needed.
But he is now doing the work of Goethe on earth, for
the latter ever wished to accomplish and distribute this
truth of the inevitable life, hereafter. This is his Ordina
tion in this period of his life, in which Goethe is expressing
himself. I, for one, and many others who live in close
touch with Herman Behr, are units of his every thought
and act.
Within the next five years he will know his greatest
achievements in relation to placing mankind in its right
ful orbit regarding God and His LIFE-PRINCIPLES.

from the masses arise by greed and graft, so to be leaders.
I would recommend a uniform low tariff the world over
and a set Constitutional Understanding established for
the betterment of all people, and I believe this shall be
achieved by mankind by 1937. This would prevent the
greedy from lording it over others.
In fact the whole plan of present corruption must
change, or poverty shall pinch more and more in certain
quarters. "Over here" all are equal. On earth men over
rule God! HERE, GOD'S SYSTEM OF PERFEC

and its POLICIES— all would have only GOOD
THOUGHTS of GOD AND MAN, and Shine in the God-
light of Spiritual and Constructive Ideals.
But eventually, all shall live in this IDEAL OF LOVE

all else, and they themselves pray, that MEN OF TO
DAY TAKE NOT THEIR ERRORS AS TRUTHS!
They preached what they thought and believed to be true
at that time.
But knowledge works in ever enlarging and increas
ing cycles, and at that time their pattern was exceed
ingly limited: so they, too, have greatly progressed with
the times, for we see and know all things. The Bible
needs its Corrections with all other principles, for it is
misleading to many simple souls who take it Materially
instead of Spiritually.
It is no sin for man to analyze and spiritualize Biblical
Statements, for the SPIRITUAL MIND outgrows nar
row MATERIAL IDEALS just as the oak tree spreads.
It too, has not always borne its present appearance. The
old trees did not have the same bark nor leaves.
So why should man attempt to hold down Religion and
not permit it to grow, expand and be useful to the day
of its generation? GOD'S WORDS HAVE NO LIMITA
TIONS! and it is entirely man's duty to learn more and
more: and especially to STUDY HIMSELF AS A UNIT
OF USEFULNESS!

Transcendentalism
Now hear a truth and list in silence, for silence is
golden. May I enter again your friendly abode (the
medium's), feeling with you the dire need of this ex
planatory missive? The love of eternity is showered upon
you in grateful sincerity for a work well done.
Not only am I here, but Henry Ward Beecher also and
Brown Eyes (mother of one of the mediums), Dante and
Raphael, who bring Consolation to hurt souls, and many,
many others. Hosts of spiritual minds always hover near
in this one great interest; for are we not all DEMON
STRATING THE TRUE MIND OF GOD? Now I
begin:
We, as Spirit Minds, delve incessantly in God's physi
cal world, to create a desire for SUBLIMITY OF
SPIRIT; for it is the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE
OF BASIC TRUTH; the only TRUTH WHERE WIS
DOM IS BORN, and where Wisdom reigneth over heart
and soul.
Man could not Survive the DOWNING FORCES of
the negative vibrations of a material world WITHOUT
THIS FUNDAMENTAL BACKGROUND of MIND
PRINCIPLES.
INSPIRATION is the highest degree of THOUGHT;
but humanity ruthlessly harass it in their careless non
thinking system of not recognizing God's highest AIMS
in the DIRECTION OF THEIR PERSONALITY.

higher man stratas the force of his thinking powers, the
higher he raises a perfect vision or perfect manifestation
of God unto his level of ideals.
As my friend and literary opponent stated, perhaps this
letter should be entitled "Hitch your wagon to a star";
but "TRANSCENDENTALISM" is the ethereal mean
ing of this phrase. It is a lesson to raise the mentality
of the human mind to its highest thinking possibilities!
It requires an effort to CONCENTRATE, and this is
why so many fail to make the uplift, for humanity tires
in the effort. But it is this "weakness of spirit" that man
must outgrow, and so expand the forces of his mind, that
he may reach the higher levels of thought to be attained
by him such as he never before experienced.
Obviously thinking men acquire a thought atmosphere
that the non-thinking man does not discover in his natural
regime of life and every day experiences. The older in
wisdom the consistent thinker
is,
the higher degree of
success he instils into the field of his endeavor. And
is
this effort not worth the endeavor to HITCH ONE'S
WAGON OF MATERIAL REALIZATIONS TO THE
STAR OF ETHEREAL PRINCIPLES?
One may contend, that life would be difficult
if
con
tinuously spent in deeper thought of the UNSEEN
WORLD, yet the commonplace VISUALIZATIONS of
a
lifetime are not the REALITIES which are
a
part of
GOD-REALIZATION in the individual. There
is
not
lasting effect nor beauteous promise in believing that life
consists of the commonplace regime wholly
!
RICHNESS OF SOUL
is
the DIVINE MANIFESTA
TION while mankind
is
in the earthly transitory state of
being; and
it
is
a
natural trend of the soul to expand in
its expression. The SOUL BEING GOD-FORCE, no one
with
a
craving for the higher things of life would desire
to suppress his GOD-SOUL ASPIRATION.

132 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
If each individual would realize that his intended ex
pression, through the will of a LIVING CREATIVE
GOD, was to GROW MENTALLY, until he reached and
developed his psychic force into a living expression, there
would be a highly organized world before the eyes of
mankind !
It is true, as quoted before, that man determines to set
his own mind to standards far below the graces of God's
intentions for him. Mind is meant by the Master to be
poetry and the music of the spheres, not the coarseness of
mechanical drums.
The pure glint of an eye can disclose the presence of
God within the individual; and when one develops one's
finer attributes to the highest degree of reflection, one
carries about with him a warmth of attraction through his
wholesome magnetic emanation of true sympathy, to
which the world is drawn. He is a HUMAN MAGNET
—just the opposite of the sensual forces—for he draws
the God-force to himself and his environment.
In such an environment his associates feel the consoling
presence of Deity near; and this is MIND-PERFEC
TION, or the highest development of the physical senses,
that God sends to earth in the name of TRANSCEN
DENTALISM! And it is this degree which all man
kind must finally pass through before they are given the
full capacity or privilege of that Christ-mind which the
Saviour demonstrated in His human contact with man
kind.
Ah ! The lasting effect of Christ's human contact with
mankindl No man has since reached that height of mind
perfection, although saints have entered into the portals
of heaven they had yet left a work undone! Spiritual
growth from the seed-creation resembles the growth of
other lineages of nature, and has its natural changes of
expression and experiences in growth.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 133
There is no reason to believe that SPIRIT DOES NOT
GROW just the same as any other of God's Growths, for
all manner of growths are Spiritual and follow one direct
principle. Man loves to assume a fancy and to shape it
into some idealistic form to suit his own material whims ;
some men live a lifetime hoping to realize that aspiration.
Yet who might not know what a fallacy it is to try to
REMODEL MOTHER NATURE to suit one's whims
and fancies? We, "over here," often have to smile, as
we HABITUALLY READ THE THOUGHTS of you
mortals, at the various Forms of Reasoning about God,
or Spirit-life, which are formulated in the minds of the
many.
Now, is it detrimental to God to deform His features in
the structure of your idealisms? No! IT IS DETRI
MENTAL ONLY to man's PROGRESS IN MIND-
GROWTH ! GOD REMAINS THE SAME! But, until
men have a clear conception of the NATURAL FORCES
OF NATURE EMANATING THROUGH ALL
THINGS, and KNOW, that this VITAL FORCE IS
GOD— PERSONIFIED; ALSO KNOW, that they, the
"human continuity," are ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE
WAY IN WHICH THIS GOD-FORCE IS EXPRESSED
IN THEMSELVES— CAN GOD MAKE HIMSELF
KNOWN TO THEM IN HIS TRUE LIGHT OF IM
MINENT PROXIMITY.
Nature, in its many symmetrical forms, given through
God's divine creative pattern, intermingles, physically and
spiritually, in all phases of life. The trees and the flowers,
perfectly natural, are but separate phases in proper rela
tion, yet they have neither brain nor brawn of the physi
cal concept to weave their own pattern.
DIVINITY is uppermost in their expression. Never
theless, man is the most highly organized construction of
all life—finer in intricate delicacy than the snowflake or

IN THE MOST LIMITED DEGREE— notwithstand
ing the refineness with which God has entrusted him.
Friends, this awakening is not meant to stir up FEAR
in your souls; it is written to stir the FINER FEELINGS
of your Consciousness, or the desire to Cultivate the
HIGHER TRENDS OF MIND.
Some may say they have only a LIMITED TREND
OF MIND! How do you know that? WHEN YOU
HAVE NOT YET DISCOVERED THE DEPTH OF
YOUR SOUL? No man since the Christ has fully dis
covered the depth of his soul, or the SESAME to heaven
in its TRUE SPIRITUAL MANIFESTATION. Why
has man allowed his BRAWN to overpower his BRAIN
regarding the Higher Realizations of life?
Jesus Christ, the great psychologist, analyzed the Im
portance of Uncovering the DEPTH OF THE MIND
when He said, "Seek, and ye shall find." He did not mean
to seek that SOMETHING OUTWARDLY! But that
HIDDEN SOMETHING which each human possesses
INWARDLY; the HIDDEN KEY OF WISDOM in the
Infinite Resources of the SOUL, which very few trouble
to UNLOCK to find the ILLIMITABLE BEAUTIES
just within the portal.
In the Spiritual Consciousness of every human being
dwell all the TRUTHS OF LIFE which are man's right
ful possession in the true "definable expression" of his
outer surroundings. And this treasure box of RARE
THOUGHT contains GENIUS in varied relationships.
This treasure box of thought, found through concen
tration and study and released self-expression of the soul,
contains the TRUE SUPPLY OF ALL KNOWLEDGE
FROM GOD HIMSELF! In other words, it is the

CEASES, and all things seem to spring to hand—UN
CONSCIOUSLY —where man at last Realizes he has
TAPPED SOMETHING, which he had never before
recognized in the expression of his life.
THIS IS TRUE TRANSCENDENTALISM! The
power to expand and develop the mind to REACH OUT
INTO THE OPEN—TO FIND THE HIDDEN GLO
RIES OR SPIRITUAL INSTRUCTION WITHIN HIS
SOUL that will give the individual KNOWLEDGE OF
LIFE IN ITS TRUE SPIRITUAL PATTERN;
WHERE ALL ERROR FADES AWAY, and Disease
has no part in the Physical or Spiritual Concept.
There is no reason in this enlightened age why mor

their living expression. It is man's rightful legacy; and
he who shuns it only KEEPS HIMSELF FROM IN
HERITING THE KINGDOM OF GOD. This is be
cause he wraps MATERIAL CONCEPTIONS about his
soul, and smothers out the finer moods of life.
And now, as to the Reformation of man's mistaken con
cepts ! The first step toward the Accomplishment of this
higher degree of MIND EMANATION, where God's
wealth and wisdom is man's natural supply,
is,
for man to

through all fundamental principles of His truths. This
God is ALL RELIGIONS COMBINED; HE IS A GOD
OF PRACTICABILITY, AND RIGHTEOUS FIXED
LAW, EMANATING ALL THOUGHT IN THE
SPIRITUAL SENSE OF GOOD, where non-essentials
and the tinsel fiimsiness of man-trimmings of doctrines
and dogmas are nonexistent! And various dogmas must
reach a true focus and Realize, THAT THEY HAVE
NO RIGHT TO DECRY THE TRUTHS OF THIS
GREAT ALL-SEEING SPIRIT OF GOD, and set up a
standard of their own for His RELIGIOUS CURRICU
LUM; for this RIGHT IS ALONE THE PRIVILEGE
of the GREAT MIND which existed before any solids
existed.
And when Accepting this GREAT GOD-REALIZA
TION OF INFINITE FORCE, which created the heav
ens and the earth, why does man assume that he has the
right to set certain standards and principles for God and
his fellowmen?
I give these lines, not to break down Religions which
are simple and sincere in their expression; but I do give
them, that man may REALIZE THE ABSURDITY of
believing in these man-made additions and flummeries as
against God's honest, simple commonsense.
It is only sensible, to admit that the origin of all stand
ardized and denominational Religions, when changed from
the Religion of Christ, are only blank forms filled out by
the physical pens of misguided men, through the instru
mentality of "man-made thinking," befitting the laws or
standards of man's isolated day and time.
These standards of denomination often quite fitted
their purpose at the time they were tendered to earth.
But PRACTICABILITY OF THOUGHT, the EXPAN
SION OF THE SOUL IN GROWTH, has not halted at
the altars of these denominational forms and figures.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 137
Their Prieres-Dieux are almost mute. The SOUL OF
MAN HAS EXPANDED and reached a place where its
ALTAR lies between man's CONSCIENCE and GOD;
and nowhere else!
Where the CONSCIENCE OF MAN must obey only
the standardized facts and figures of denominations, it no
longer is the Basis of a Comforting Religion; and has un
consciously outgrown the chrysalis of the old religious
narrowness. In the past, too, man was blamed for dis
obeying the universal God.
When all this became apparent to leaderships, —in
order that man might be held captive to certain facts and
figures— another MAN-MADE DEGREE was added,
whereby Religion itself expanded a bit to fit the time and
place, and the individual soul was allowed a little more
freedom of thought.
But this was not an EXPANSION OF THE SOUL-
SPIRIT OF GOD WITHIN MAN'S BOSOM WHICH
REBELS AGAINST RELIGIOUS SLAVERY TO
OTHER MEN.
Had not the finer feeling against injustice and rebel
lion dwelt in the human soul, ready to spring into action,
the base Idolatries to Baal would still exist in the field of
faith, but they slowly passed away, together with the
damnable forces of ignorance which prevailed. Yet man
still draws upon himself the forces of Superstition and
Ignorance; not for any intentional reason, but because
he ACCEPTS THE STANDARDIZED, MAN-MADE
RELIGIONS AS HIS LIGHT FOR LIFE'S PATHWAY.
Humanity will find, at the end of their earthly trail, or
life's transitory state of being, which ends immediately at
God's altar in heaven, a far different ideal than that upon
which they had spent a lifetime in cultivating. They will

Cosmic Plane and be properly instructed. For this is the
name of God's school for the uninstructed in righteous
ness.
It is not like one of your physical schools; but it is a
school, where it takes much SPIRITUAL CONCEN
TRATION to discover these simple truths of life which
God has placed openly before all mankind. And man can
far easier learn these truths while in his physical experi
ence, for he does not suffer the Penance of BITTER
REGRETS to crush his soul.
In other words, this is a SCHOOL OF PENANCE,
AND NO MAN CAN ESCAPE IT unless he has come
"over here" with that true Defineness and acknowledged
soul-consciousness of owing all allegiance reverently to
the SINGLE AND ONLY TRUE GOD; and thus has
God continually speaking through his soul-consciousness.
As I have stated, it is self-evident that no one has been
quite so well prepared as was Jesus in this degree of mind;
yet it is the laudable ambition of every Christian soul to
reach this realization.
And when the spirit passes away from the body, —well,
let me tell you of my own experience! —DEATH seemed
only as though I were floating slowly and gently through
space. However, it was not Unconsciousness! and ap
parently, a picture of my life passed before me as I went
along. I may explain it in this way: as the drowning man
sees the flash of sensation of all his life-experience before
him in a continuous thought-picture, individually ex
pressed, aware of his momentary danger of passing out
of the earthly existence.
Now this same sense of thought, like a fast moving
reel, was opened to me in one great vista before my con

Many are stricken with the thought, that life seems to
have been all wrong in their earth experience; and there
comes flashing into their consciousness the idea of return
ing to earth and starting all over again; but the FORCE
or that SOMETHING, CARRYING THE SPIRITUAL
BODY ONWARD, WILL NOT LOOSEN ITS HOLD.
In the daze of it all—at least it was my experience —I
seemed to pass into what seemed like a chamber of
portaled curtains, colored in several pastel shades like
chiffon floating in the breeze. I knew it was not a ma
terial surrounding, for I reached out and touched them
and FOUND THAT THEY WERE NOT SOLID. Then
I discovered that my hand was not solid; so it was thus
that I REALIZED that I had entered into the next
change of nature's natural growth.
Satisfied? Yes! I rather disliked the thought of the
change in worlds, yet I was indifferent until some one
spoke. It was the voice of my Lydia, who whispered
that "all was well, and that this was only my natural
trend." Then I felt that I wanted to see God. Then
loved ones came to greet me, and it seemed as if I had
never been parted from them. We were at once like one
great family, and they spoke of my literary experience
because they were interested in mind experience; and
this is the highest topic of interest here.
This is quite natural because man in his natural expres
sion emanates educational uplift and improvement, and
all these kin WANTED TO LEARN SOMETHING;
more than they could discover on earth. I remember they
began to ask me questions about different things.

it was there, where I reached out and secured my higher
thoughts expressed in my physical efforts.
I remember saying to myself, "Why could I not have
known this when I was in the fleshy body?" Perhaps had
I known the truth, I might not have known just how to
reach out in mind and bring it into action and expression.
Yet I may truthfully state that I possessed in my life
time that SOMETHING which I could not explain, but
an INFINITE ANSWER was GIVEN TO ME, when I
found myself amongst the POETS and MUSES of God.
I realized that I had neglected all my life to use the
True Inspirational God-sense, or the Practical Qualifying
of the SPIRITUAL SENSES OF GOD WITHIN MY
SELF, wherein all that is perfection, lay dormant.
If it is possible for you to find this field, dear readers,
neglect it not on account of the physical, artificial real
ities of life, for you can bring no other possessions into
the next development-phase of life. Aspire to magnify
the GOD-SPARK! And start with it the divine fire of
God-thought in your every waking moment.
Since coming to this realization, I have discovered that
MIND IS GOD even in your temporal senses, and one
must create one's own God, which IS WISDOM OF THE
SEVENTH SENSE in the mind curriculum.
And you, dearly beloved, misspent minds and souls, the
sooner that you truly realize the VALUE OF THE
HIGHER REPRESENTATION OF MIND-FORCE,
the higher value you will place on your own minds.
To live the simple, honest, clean life is a beginning,
whereby man realizes the serenity and sweetness of true
living. I strongly advocate the simple life, a quietude,
where life is expressed in emanation of fine character, de
picting the definitiveness of the flower, which is the sim
plest way I can illustrate this to your thought.

is uppermost in one's everyday expression, one has no de
sire for the grinding noises of earthly pandemonium. The
nearer Spiritual Truth the individual
is,
the further he
wanders away from earth's vibrations —and the more
he will seek the SOLITUDES OF GOD IN THE
GOLDEN SILENCES OF LIFE!
It
is
in the Quietude of Thoughts that INSPIRATION
IS BORN TO LIGHT, for disturbing vibrations of earth
bring to the consciousness
a
picture of physical senses
which do not reflect God. Therefore the faster life one
lives, the further he travels away from his SPIRITUAL
EGO!
The importance of living
is
important in the cultiva
tion of REFINEMENT of Character. Refinement of
Character speaks of that SOMETHING which no one in
the physical body can describe. To reflect Refinement
means to open up Spiritual Vistas, where the material
wagon of life changes into
a
GOLDEN CHARIOT OF
HEAVEN, HITCHED TO THE GOLDEN STAR OF
HOPE!
To HOPE FOR THINGS UNSEEN, and to spend
a
lifetime in fervent study of THINGS UNSEEN, IS BUT
PREPARING
A
PATH FOR THE TRUE SPIRITUAL
LIFE IN ETERNITY!
I
will add in closing that there
is
no separation here
from those we love; and never have we—as spirit entities
—been separated from your physical life-strain unless we
self-willed
it
so. You with physical eyes, have outgrown
SPIRITUAL VISION but
it
will not be for long. When
the soul
is
fully developed the spiritual vision will again
return to its own right in the physical world.
So, dear ones, hitch your material wagon to the SPIR
ITUAL STAR OF ASPIRATION IN LIFE, AND
MAKE STRAIGHT FOR YOUR GOAL! DIVINITY,
SPIRIT MIND, AND GOD, ARE ONE, AND ALL

The Invisible World
Good morning, ladies! I am come to be your essayist
for the day, not in the name of science or materialism,
but in SPIRITUALITY alone. You shall have a lecture
on astronomy later; but if you read my biography you
will see that I was always greatly interested in Universal
Cosmology and Psychic Research, and I so rejoice at my
"new knowledge," that I wish to impart my NEW
VISION OF LIFE.
Also I ask you to treat me as though I were flesh and
blood, for I am in no way apart from you—just one of
the workers of Infinite Time and Space. Truly the so-
called Division which man calls a Truth between "life
and after life" is purely a Fiction of his imagination.

where, they find no reason for any vagueness between
ourselves—the Invisible Forces of "this side" and Hu
manity walking the earth. You cannot see the air you
breathe, yet its presence is proven as well as the fact
that it sustains life—exhilarating and renewing the body.
When Humanity deny our Existence, they, in doing
so, also, deny the same Force by which man is energized
and of which MIND consists, for it is through the same
Combination of Hydrogen and Oxygen and other Ele
ments which give life to many principles.
LIFE IS ELECTRIFIED POWER, which created the
Intuitional World of Direction, one unit being a minute
part of all "electronic creation." This directs the MIND
into its perfect channel of correct thought to live in the
God-realm, wholly in communication with spiritual im
port.
The outer carnal body which is a home for the SOUL
for a period of time, belongs to the vegetable and mineral
status. For the time being, it is just as important for it
to live in perfect condition, as it is Relative to the SOUL
and under the God-regime.
Its tearing down is due to the separation of the control
of body and spirit while they are attached together in
man; but this is due to Unnatural MIND DIRECTION,
and is not the pattern planned for the Thought and
Action of man.
To weaken the SPIRITUAL DOMINATION over the
CREATIVE MATERIAL BODY, means to bring into
Control the Evil Satanic Forces opposing God. But until
the world has mastered the art of Spiritual Thinking and
Direction, this relation shall be most eminent in your
world through lack of wisdom.

in a way, and attempted to be a worldly emancipator of
Spiritual Truths; and I did discover many new lights
upon the subject which, however, even in my Capacity of
RESEARCHER I FOUND UNFATHOMABLE !
I now find that this was due to the fact that my SPIR
ITUAL LIMITATIONS withheld them from me; my
Material Consciousness withholding SPIRITUAL LIGHT
from the lack of sufficiently Energized Intuitional Elec
tronic POWER. My earthly Vibrations were not At
tuned to the Realms of HIGHER THOUGHT.
The "Strata of Vibrations" of the individual mind is
the key to this unfoldment. The faster the Vibrations
are, the quicker is the INTUITION of man, and the
more rapidly he connects with the GOD-REALM OF
MIND; and more and more rises toward the deep
THOUGHT REGIONS OF HIGHER MIND-UN-
FOLDMENT!
Thus the greater is the strata of man's glory as he
climbs the steeps of knowledge, and the greater the per
sonality of him who endeavors to explore and answer
intricate questions.
The questions which I expounded in life seem most
simple to me now. It seems like looking back on a ma
terial puzzle which I had spent a lifetime in fashioning;
but I see now that my material senses, with their trained
limitations, so overcame my Spiritual Vision, that I now
realize the cause of my ill-success.
Strange to say, immediately after my Transition I
found the perfect pattern—and it was so simple! Man
spends years Formulating his Anticipation of Heaven,
when it all depends upon the dynamic push back of his
self-will to Utilize the greatness of God power which
vibrates through the earth to create —Heaven.

Knowledge I seek. I find there is absolutely no limita
tion to thought and learning. Even God Himself in His
creative pattern is still fashioning new displays in nature.
Thus our Own Heaven of Existence displays newer
and higher patterns as fast as our Mentality is prepared
to receive them. These new ideals are born out of the
Spiritual Exhilaration of Mind Development —and GOD
IS THE CENTER AND FOUNT OF IT ALL.
I am so happy to explain to the world also, that God is
the Central DIVINE ENERGY OF ALL CREATION.
HE is not embodied in one specific form, but is the ELEC
TRIC FORCE, THE DYNAMIC PROGRESSION OR
THE SOUL CENTER OF ALL THINGS, and a part of
His wisdom is developed in mankind.
This is the only God that man shall ever know, and
every SOUL shall discover for itself that this is the en
tire truth, and is not intended to break down or disap
point any possibilities when one discovers, that God is
the wholesome Creator and Energizing Element present
in every living thing.
I find that it Exhilarates one more and more to learn,
that God has ever been present in the SPIRITUAL
BODY of every man; and as fast as man tends to mag
nify His graces, more and more will he resemble the
creator.
Even in the first sphere of the heavenly existence, God
is there, notwithstanding that evil souls, mired in their
own hell-consciousness, darken the knowledge of His
presence. This is because for years they have dwelt in
a chaos of detrimental dragging down untruths. Hence
they must climb out of this material quagmire of material
errors before they have a clear vision to see and know
Deity just as He is.
In entering this Spiritual World, man has just what he
brings mentally with him, only that and nothing more.

146 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
Man has every privilege while he is on earth, to outfit
himself with that which is fit to bring before God. The
world which man has constructed about himself while
in his short session of earth has been largely misunder
stood by him and forced; thus after his transition —Life is
a Process of SPIRITUAL UNFOLDMENT OF THE
ACTUAL TRUTH!
If man on earth chooses to live in the Material Aspect
of Life, and delays his Spiritual Education, he alone is
the cause of that delay, for he has the pattern of perfect
direction drawn for him while in his temporal state by
lessons from God. But when he chooses to stamp material
inconsistencies and untruths on his memory, he carries
on this pattern for centuries.
Thus it is that there have to be many Spheres of
Thought Correction to accommodate and clarify what
man brings with him, through his mind emanations. We
have countless worlds of wisdom, where the Forces of the
"endless chain of life" are brought together to a certain
extent and Educated until the Spirit Realizes, that he is
a UNIT OF THE GOD-MIND, or Universal Realm of
Knowledge.
Yet, strange to say, each individual is following out
his own pattern —which is his own constituted ideal.
For instance I contact many associates whose ideals tend
toward other fields of progression; again others occupy
individual spheres of interest. There are agricultural
centers —Dramatists have a center —the Literary Fields
mingle together in one relationship.
Thus the work which you have most magnified in life
is your SOUL CALLING, and is continued in after life.
Many, many are engaged in PSYCHIC RESEARCH;
and in my boyhood days I felt a calling to this field, and
I now know through experience, that it should have been
my LIFE WORK!

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 147
Strange to say I have no desire to write about scientific
principles of astronomy. That which interests me the
most is to unfold minds to discern, that there are no
MYSTERIOUS SECRETS as earth loves to imagine.
ALL OF LIFE IS AN OPEN BOOK OF PROMISE!
and Mediumship between the two worlds is a NATURAL
FACTOR OF LIFE and the Unfoldment of the sixth
and seventh— or HIGHER SENSES OF MANKIND.
The five senses pertain to the Physical Body, but the
other two are SPIRITUAL, and enter into the Expan
sive Plane of Spiritual Progress.
In these two "dormant senses" lies the whole WORLD
OF WISDOM! For God is implanted deep in the Soul
of man wherein is His OWN PRECIOUS SANCTUARY.
From thence man builds up his entire SPIRITUAL NA
TURE FROM A WEALTH available from no outward
source.
It is the SPIRITUAL EYE which Visualizes all the
GOOD OF LIFE and accepts that Goodliness for the
purpose of countermanding misleading physical direction.
THE SOUL IS MAN'S SPIRITUAL DYNAMO, be
loved! But the world has too long dwelt upon the folly
that the SOUL was non-existent—even perhaps a myth!
Man is the Mythical part of this untruth. His SOUL
RELATIONS ARE THE ONLY REAL PART OF
HIM!
In support of honest and successful mediumship I wish
to state the fact, that the reason many mediums are un
able to bring loved ones to your side,
is,
because many
lack sufficient learning of SPIRITUAL PRINCIPLES
to bring them successfully. Then, too,
it
is
often
a
lack
of experience on the part of loved ones gone on.
If
a
spirit entity has not learned how to unfold its
PSYCHIC SELF to mortals,
it
has this yet to acquire in
the newer life, and

is
not always an easy matter for

spirit to learn to do this. However, it may be no fault
of the medium if a loved one has not the strength to
come back. She only lays the golden pathway for the
contact.
Also, the mortal must open wide the doorway; but he
who is not PSYCHICALLY Constituted cannot visualize
the spirit; he may only feel its distinct presence through
the Thrill and Coolness of the etherized body. In fact
the mortal is just as responsible for non-success as is the
Spirit Entity or an incompetent medium. All must be
psychically developed to unfold the way, and all are
equally responsible.
When sitting in the silence the mind concentrates on the
desire to visualize a loved one, and it is thus not difficult
to ope the door of the soul to them—to be receptive, and
not to bar them out with Unbelief, Superstition, or Shal
lowness of nature. One may even open the arms as if to
greet them.
All of this is helpful to a medium, for it is simply
Power added to Power, a spiritual wavelength upon which
the loved ones travel. When a mortal expresses a desire
the medium endeavors to open the way, and this is a
"spiritual lamp which the beloved see and follow."
There are Spiritual Guides surrounding every person
but their efforts are ineffectual, unless the mortal shows
a significant desire to help. A SPIRIT finds it more
difficult to come to one of earth than for the earthly one
to look for him.
Then again the mortal has the aid of spiritual guides to
break down material barriers. One mortal ofttimes has
as many as seven Spiritual Guides, but only one GUARD
IAN ANGEL. Usually this is a beloved one gone on
before; and one does not always keep the same one, for as
they advance Spiritually in their studies they Progress!
and the mortal is given another.

But they are the ones who soothe the upwrought soul of
earth in sorrow, trouble or disappointment, or any ill
world relationship. They open the Door of SPIRITUAL
ITY that the mortal may see the better way. A mortal
has also Spiritual Guides who lead their earthly way suc
cessfully if mortals will but listen.
All humanity have their Spiritual Physicians —oft-
times greatly benefiting them. They have Spiritual at
torneys, so to speak, advisers—mental directors, also.
All of these manifest in special mind direction; yet a
mortal is prone to follow his own mind direction, and as
he persists in thinking, so he is. But if something new
comes up and he needs a Spiritual Guide, one is provided.
Thus it is that man is Inspired and Receives new Ideals
for they are transmitted from the Spiritual World by in
visible guides; and when one is attentive and psychical,
one is soon able to name them, and they will come at call.
They have others to aid as well, for the whole institu
tional curriculum of our World is KINDLY AND UP
LIFTING SERVICE! We wish all things to be made
perfect and Godlike.
This is the great downfall of the world that they do not
comprehend and accept their spiritual gifts and associa
tions. He who does believe and calls on these capable
helpers finds greater faith and treasures at the end of his
trail.
I may say, that while I dwelt on the earth sphere, I
ever upheld and was aware of my Spiritual Guides and
beloved helpers, and I ofttimes called upon them. Yet I
whispered not a word to the world being in awe of their
jeers, for they did not understand the Science of SPIR

ones to you. I will say that the first and second spheres
after the "death reality" are near your own.
These two realms are principally classes of Spiritual
Correction for neglected work, and one must pass through
these two spheres to make up one's deficiencies before
one is fitted to progress into the God realm. People of
earth intuitively feel sorrow about their loved ones passed
on, for in a way they are still bound to them by spiritual
relationships, but these people should realize that they
are sorrowing under a misconception, and that they must
seek Higher Thought and Higher Light to escape there
from.
This helps them to free themselves and travel onward
in the Spiritual Realm and Advance until they become
teachers. These mistaken souls are what people call
"earthbound spirits," and many of them remain for dec
ades in this condition. Ah! the tragedy of
it,
and
it
is
so
unnecessary.
These two spheres are now actually being revolution
ized into
a
higher mind realm, because Humanity are
quickening their spiritual education and raising the aver
age of their mental status. If you of earth would have
crime die out—diminish the unceasing expounding of
it
in the press, in pictures, and daily intercourse, for all this
produces a low degree of mentality or thought force.
When crimes are thus pictured on earth,
it
exaggerates
them in the minds of the earthbound in the two spheres
of existence closely hugging the earth. And this
is
actually
a
temptation to them to return to earth and
repeat their own miserable experiences. It doubles their
sorrows and brings back their unhappy pasts.
It would be well for humanity to meditate upon the
sin of this unnecessary and unworthy procedure, that

to reach the God-realm, yet still cling to earthly relation
ships on account of the world's attraction.
Pray for them, dear ones. Desires are prayers! In
your mind's eye visualize such in the God-realm, and help
them to progress and to go onward to aid in building a
great universe for mankind to enter into. Remember
that these two spheres of degraded souls are largely
maintained in this state through mortal example, and this
TRUTH is not Realized on either side —yet both sides
are blindly struggling for better expression.
The only way to reach the higher mind is to give out
the facts, and it IS within the province of mortals to
RIGHT THE WRONG. It is a misstitch that may be
unraveled and corrected. It seems easy for the physical
mind to see MISTAKES IN OTHERS, but NONE SEE
THEMSELVES AS OTHERS SEE THEM!
Thus possibly I may touch the heart strings of human
ity by explaining these principles, for the sake of those
"immortal souls" struggling for freedom from their old
entanglements. But unless they are released by some
outward means, their old haunts and lusts will return to
them like boomerangs.
If mortals would become a part of the "heavenly sys
tem" without delay, let them re-create their patterns in
earth life into the God-light of Higher Wisdom which is
depicted to them on every side. Let them not concentrate
only on material principles —especially of the lowest
grade.
In any high effort divine principle and expression covers
and fulfills material aid. Poverty and stress enter the
realm of life, but this is because of starved mental direc
tion and habitual oppression. One man alone is not re

Before long man will Realize, that there are no Limita

into the Limitless field of Quickening Intuition wherein

I predict that within twenty years every individual of

The sensational press is responsible for stirring up most
of the hectic propaganda which one's MIND is impressed
with. But we read the MINDS of God's children, and by
a large majority they are for Peace. There is no more
lust and greed in one nation than in another, although

which it operates. As his MIND IS, so is the individual's
intellectual strata.
And man will find life no different on the "other side,"
if he is of low degree, for LIFE there is all mental, and
he starts out with just what he brings with him in his
Conscience! Heaven or hell is his own self-manufac-
tured domain of earth; it is all according to one's choice
of curriculum, and one's degree of unfoldment and in
tellectual strata.
Now in closing, please tell Herman Behr, that I am his
SPIRITUAL ENERGIZER. If he feels low spirited I
come to him. Tell him if he needs me I come at his call.
The reason he is ordained to put forth this great work
is,
that he has such
a
wonderful FORCE OF SPIRITUAL
GUIDES and thus has great and abundant SPIRITUAL
POWER.
My favorite aphorism in life was, "Treat God as
if
He were always present as an honored guest." In feeling
HIS DIVINE PRESENCE Constantly, one
is
Refining
himself and forever bringing to himself the HIGHER
DEGREE OF SPIRITUAL SENSES! This gives the
actually imminent God, yourself, and your environment
the privilege of enjoying the mutual ecstatic presence.
Now vivaciously and graciously
I
bid you Au Revoir.
CAMILLE FLAMMARION.

156 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
Henry Ward Beecher: Now drop your worldly chaos
and listen to him whom I have brought to your abode —
one of great wisdom and truth. Allow me to introduce
to you
JOHANN E. BODE
1747-1826
Give of Yourself If You Would Know God
I greet you, worldly friends, as well as do those here
with me. We all make obeisance to the two ladies who
await my words. Would you believe that I am a close
companionate spirit to your good publisher, and I have
come to bring a special message of love to him from
Goethe. I am in touch with him through Goethe, my
friend of former years as well as now and always.
I am from Germany also, having been born in Ham
burg in 1747. My interests lay in astronomy, and when
but a lad I studied closely the secret of eclipses and
verified their truths. I have been through many expe
riences also in the spiritual duration of my life, and my
earthly experience was a long career of fulness and glory.
Since my change from earth life I have never been
deprived from taking part in the unfoldment of intelli
gence to the world, for I am still one of God's units in the
everlasting scheme of progression. I was born amidst
very trying times. There was no romance or glamor to
ordinary life because of the domineering rule of despots
and their endless schemes to burden the commonwealth
with unfair taxations to enforce laws of worship.
To live at that time was but to bring a cloud of doubt
and superstition to an era of domineering trend. It was
indeed a difficult world in which I, a weak lad, deprived
of even sufficient nourishment, sought to enlarge in men

tality and the inevitable truths of the mystery of life.
But it was always my fixed determination to shed the
shackles of men's heavy dour burdens, and to live apart
and above the greedy shambles of ignorance of that day,
that I might bring my fellowmen into the light of the
better world of knowledge, hope, and God's true realm.
Ah! dear readers, when you ope this BOOK OF UN-
FOLDMENT into the "true light of life," meditate
deeply, and be filled with gratitude for the present exten
sion of mind wherein you dwell, free to formulate the pic
tures, which your spiritual vision brings before your
mental eye— and out of that CLARITY OF VISION—
make of your Surroundings a HEAVEN UPON EARTH!
When I was a lad and lived in a hut queerly built by
my father's hands, Humanity so delved for material sus
tenance, that they took little time to develop their ma
terial brain. Our necessities were produced through our
own labor. Money was at a premium and was not avail
able for even our necessities, for it was taken from us
and put into the treasuries and for the benefit of our
rulers.
What a farce before the face of God that humanity was
placed in this empirical direction as slaves to the un
conscionable, selfish rule of manmade tyranny. But
to-day, God, the Great Inevitable Force of life, is making
law for mankind directly, in SPIRITUAL EMANA
TIONS; not through THOUGHT-FORCES WHICH
ENTIRELY DEFLECT HIS RULE.
All principles of creation have arisen through crude
forms by the constant unfoldment of the laws of nature;
but up to a recent period, men believed that God set cer
tain standards for the mind in the Holy Book, and ac
cepted it in a material and literal sense—instead of only
as being SPIRITUAL ADVICE; and thus they believed

However, humanity realized that MIND cannot be
detained in a narrow illumination for ever. Along with
the rapid unfoldment of the outer world, MIND IS
STRUGGLING INTO A SPIRITUAL SUPREMACY,
WHICH GOD PLANNED FROM THE BEGINNING

MOS, WHICH ALWAYS EXISTED, IS IDENTICAL
WITH THE MIND OF MANKIND, WHICH IS A
PART OF IT!
The universal mind of the Cosmos invariably speaks
for itself no matter how a certain element of humanity
seek to delay its growth. It continually struggles for its
inherent degree of growth as it was originally planned
to do. And more and more shall it surprise living beings
when they discover how limited in expression, under
present conditions, the Human Mind really is as against
its possibilities.
The Mind has outgrown much of its crudeness and is
finding itself much finer and broader. And this constant
"mind development" grows through the ELECTRONIC
FORCE OF VIBRATION. THE WHOLE EXIST
ENCE OF THE COSMOS CENTERS IN ONE TINY
INVISIBLE ELECTRONIC UNIT OF FORCE! And
these Units are smaller than those of any force yet veri
fied by men up to this day and time.
Within the next twenty years there shall come a newer
discovery than the "force" which has been split and
verified by scientists; and it will be sifted to a greater
degree, wherein creation may be analyzed. Even the
MIND OF GOD SHALL BE ANALYZED AND

a finer analysis of this truth, were it possible for the
physical mind to comprehend it. But it will be unfolded
through the Spiritual Advancement of the Ego of Man in
God-progression, for all principles return to their original
expression.
VIBRATION, in relation to mankind, Begins with the
Independent Thought-wave in their God-spark —or Spirit
of Life, and is separate and entirely apart from the physi

IS THE TRUE GOD-SPARK OF LIFE—or the SELF
—and is now passing through various phases of improve
ment.
And this is only as the mortal with his physical vision
views Improvement in all realities of growth. The
SPIRIT IS NOT—as the scientist believes— a part of
an ESTABLISHED PURPOSE. The SPIRIT ITSELF
IS CONSTANTLY EXPANDING AND UNFOLDING
AND BECOMING CAPABLE OF HIGHER POSSI
BILITIES AS IT CONTACTS LIFE—just as the phys
ical unit grows in its contacts with life.
In the orthodox world it is believed that the SPIRIT
is an established God-reality that can never be changed;
presumably the same yesterday, to-day and to-morrow.
But not so! When humanity realizes the TRUTH, they
will find, THAT THE SPIRIT IS THE GROWING
NUCLEUS OF ALL LIFE! THAT THE UNFOLD-

OF THE EGO IS THE ANSWER TO LIFE, AND IS

Cruel, Crude and Unprincipled —to what he shall yet be.
It
is,
therefore, tremendously important that WE, as
a
Spiritual Force for Improvement, enter your Vibration,
so that you may receive OUR HIGHER SPIRITUAL
DIRECTION! Thus you will find, that the Ego of the
human
is
a receiving set or station, which links man with
the "field of universal knowledge" and the world of finer
senses of the Infinite Realm; and this
is
the rightful her

WE of the Spirit World consider earth life as being the

I

Yet each individual for a time

VIBRATE LIFE in this sense for a time, his human mind
could not so Verify God. Man must live in this stage of
flesh and blood to FIND THE TRUE PATH TO THE

great systematic plan, to develop and still develop it fur
ther. Humanity are not born to adhere to earth, but are
only a part of its progression for a time. The earth is
only a background or a setting.
But men are born to earth as a minute part of the
"great universal thought-plan" in its Infancy of Progress;
for each individual is planned by Deity to be a UNIT
of His Kingdom Builders to verify His works on earth.
And when MIND comes into its own degree of intelli
gence, man will understand, that it is God's intended mis
sion for him thus to unfold.
And no limitations of manmade standards, or enforced
binding laws or materialistic selfish methods of delay,
shall succeed in delaying this progress effectually.
MIND, however, shall expand upon these higher princi
ples more and more, as the cedars of Lebanon teach their
lesson: for it is the only tree in existence whose branches
point to earth and the ends then turn and point upward to
God— and thus to ELEVATE THOUGHT— IS TO
FIND GOD WORKING WITH MAN ON EARTH.
Now I turn back to the subject of VIBRATION. To
analyze this idea is to ATTACK THE ATMOSPHERE
OF SPACE and sift it down to its finest degree. It can
be so Divided into Forces too small for any human mind
to recognize and understand as a MIND-REALITY in a
physical sense.
The secrets of Vibration have been but little unfolded,
yet through the study of PSYCHOLOGY and the higher
laws which intuitions have allowed, man knows there is
a terrific force behind all principles working toward suc
cess and harmony in earth life.

THE LIFE ENERGY OF CREATION which man
BREATHES AND IS VITALIZED BY. All the
FORCES FOR GOOD of this great limitless expanse—
when gathered together—ARE THE CREATIVE GOD!
And this is the God that man shall eventually know!
The ONLY GOD IN EXISTENCE! Please do not un
derstand me wrongly and believe that I endeavor to tear
down any beliefs that have been substantiated by man in
his endeavors to Comprehend God. However, the pre
cious thought of seeing the face or recognizing God in
eternity will not be realized.
It is indeed a strange sensation when one "passes to this
side" to discover, that one himself is of God-formation;
that one has been Passing through a NATURAL CREA
TIVE, INEVITABLE FORCE OF PROGRESSION!
I well remember looking at the body I left behind me
in my last stage of earthly existence, and how I wondered
why I still retained a complete semblance of
it,
when there
lay my natural body, discarded. But the body which
I
retained had natural form, sensation, feeling and hearing,
yet there was no flesh
!
It
is
indeed
a
strange experience.
However,
I
had
a

lift, where no pain, sorrow or regret existed; and
I
seemed
to go forward on life's course just as usual. Yet

for some days trying to ascertain why the physical life
seemed to be closed out from my new expression.
I
could not make my loved ones see, feel my touch, or
hear me, and
it
was
a

I
myself was so vividly
alive! But all was Transcendental and

I
discovered that
I
must begin
to unsolve my new life and learn how to go on with the

in my physical body.
No one knew, that while I existed in the body of earth,
I could COMMAND MY SPIRIT to go forth and learn
how to perform my laboratory work, and that while sit
ting in my comfortable chair I was in connection also
with the Spiritual Scientists out in the fields of space.
But HERE it does not matter when or where one per
forms a task. One perpetually sees new wonders and
glories; and I soon learned that it was MY OWN VIBRA-
TIVE FORCE that emanated my spirit out into the
realms of higher knowledge. After my transition I was
told by various scientists, that all individuals were capable
of sending their spirit forth without injury to the physical
body. All that was necessary was to know how to sepa
rate the material and spiritual bodies.
I can remember seeming to be in touch with people
foreign to me, and to find myself in a strange place as a
"guest of Celebrities" who were living in a world of
higher intelligence directed by their own mind. I dearly
loved to visit these places when I had a knotty problem
to solve. I visited academic, scientific and philosophic
realms. There were great masters, radiant of counte
nance, who taught me my lessons, and also that GOD
WAS UNIVERSAL MIND!
And I remember their telling me, that were I to en
deavor for ages, I could not unfold a fragment of what
there was to be learned; and I am still finding it true, yet
am doing my bit to unfold intelligence to the flesh and
blood of this day.
TIME and PLACE ARE AS NOTHING HERE, FOR

The Wisdom continually helping mankind along is in

Realize, that each one is a WORLD IN PROGRESSION
—Vibrating onward in learning; and that your world is
but one unit: but just as much a unit as any of the greater
planets.
In my lifetime I discovered countless celestial bodies,
which had not been seen through mechanical means,
through Spiritual Research while my spirit was in space.
I always believed, that the new life would not be so
strange to me, because I traveled abroad and found new
constellations and stars separate and apart from any that
man may see or has seen.
There are seven universes connected with yours; but
your whole Constellation is really "one universe." You
have twelve planets—the Milky Way and many forms
visible to the eye and the telescopes of to-day —yet there
are "countless worlds" which have not been discovered.
But entirely outside of your Constellation, there are
eighty-four realms of stars of more stupendous velocity,
than any heretofore discovered by your realm. And they
are all CYCLES OF LIFE-DIRECTION, and it is a
God's truth, that each and every Individual will even

only little, since being here, yet I have experienced a high
degree of Evolutionary Reality.
But in each spiritual plane I visited I have found a
Higher Direction. Your world is but a starting point or

of MENTAL VIBRATION relative to Jupiter, Uranus,

law enforcement is broken asunder and the LIGHT OF
LOVE and RIGHTEOUSNESS shines freely and un
shadowed the world over. Then it will be Understood,
that HAPPINESS CONSISTS— IN GIVING OUT
GOOD FROM ONE'S SELF, and NO EVIL!
A religion founded upon this principle —"Give largely
of yourself"— will REVEAL THE TRUE LAW OF
SPIRITUAL VIBRATION! The higher degree one
gives of ONE'S SELF, the less one is conscious of physi
cal concepts ; and when death's door is approached, there
are no burdens to unload upon the altar of God.
The MIND is clarified and ready to go on and expand
and illuminate the "life ahead." As I came I passed
through the sphere of EARTHBOUND SPIRITS, and
their sufferings were most terrible to see. Their ideals
were all selfish and carnal, owing to the inflow and out
flow of their earthly life.
So beloved readers, believe in and cultivate your SPIR
ITUAL GIFTS ; then you are Unconsciously Learning the
LAW OF VIBRATION and Taking on the God-nature.
Trying to solve vibratory law in a mathematical sense
accomplishes little! But one can understand it by com
prehending the Ego or God-spark within one.
"Like attracts like" is a very serious axiom and a DE
PENDABLE LAW OF VIBRATION!
Please tell Herman Behr that Heine and Schopenhauer
are here with me. We all closely inspire him and his

the best of everything, I shall admit my blunders, espe
cially in choosing the wrong mates as my life partners.
So I may say that only my younger years, up to the time
I was thirty-five years of age, were really worth recording
as the notable part of my life's harmony.
I may really say that I consider only half of my life
worth mentioning; the other half was lived in "darkness
mentally"—and later on as you may know, in total dark
ness from blindness which came over me in my mature
life.
In the days when I was stricken with many unaccount
able unpleasant conditions, man PLACED THE BLAME
FOR EVERYTHING UPON GOD and fate; not upon
HIMSELF, where it all belonged. To-day the psycholo
gists' fundamental purposes in thinking out their philoso
phy have done away with this unprincipled reaction of
God's children.
It is not well to dwell on unhappy situations any more
than is necessary to bring out the points by which I shall
endeavor to reach the reading public for their benefit;
and that is to say: THAT MAN ALONE is accountable
for his outer surroundings and all that he brings upon
himself THROUGH HIS CHOSEN THINKING CA
PACITY.
Every civilized home should bear this slogan: "MY
HOME IS MY PARADISE."
And a Paradise it shall be, just according to the FOUN
DATION OF THINKING PRINCIPLES ESTAB
LISHED IN THAT HOME, and the Building up of its
Ideals as the STANDARD OF THINKING.
I fancy I may say my only true sweetheart was my
mother, whose ideals were all set upon high standards of
thinking and bringing into our home-realm only the very
best THOUGHT, for us to build up a proper founda
tional thinking, as we were a large family.

170 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
Since Education was our family standard and banner,
we were considered an unusual family. My parents side
tracked the commonplace relationships of life and held
fast to poetry, philosophy and music; in fact we were
considered what the illiterate of to-day call educated
people: "highbrows."
However it is fortunately the privilege of all individuals,
regardless of others ideas, to attain the attributes of the
higher and artistic senses, temperaments and souls, if
they choose to make this their strata on earth.
It was a dream of father and of mother, to have this
regime of education lasting, and that it shape our lives
above the commonplace modes of literacy which prevailed
in our neighborhood.
No one could have meanly called us snobs, because we
were reared to believe in the vibrations of harmony,
courtesies and knowledge. This love of the good things
of life but cast a glory of spiritual direction about
our souls and drew to our fireside the individuals who
were worthy to be known; and they too believed in the
INFINITE DIRECTION OF GOD IN HIS COSMOS.
Those who were not EN RAPPORT with us were sim
ply of a different class of thinking; and I may truthfully
say, needed to know much more to attain the same plat
form of thought and reaction, that we occupied who were
students. For when, in their Transformation, they first
place their foot upon the ladder of intelligence to the
"spiritual heights" existing here, they shall discover, that
it was the direct purpose of the Almighty Creator of
GOOD, that THINKING EXPANSION bears the only
banner to SUCCESS ! and that there is no lasting hope in
latent, dormant thought. So thus it was that in our draw
ing room on evenings —Ah! one would see mother sitting
at the harp, her beautiful white hands gently sounding
out music which seemed a part of heaven to me.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 171
Recalling my childhood memory of her melodies, I
must not overlook this point to say that the music of
heaven sounds much like her harp. There are no harsh
blasting tones; and he who plays the French or Bass-horn
could not complete his proficiency in eternity. He had
best take up the study of stringed music if his soul aspires
for musical continuity.
I ofttimes thought that mother must have come direct
from heaven that she could so bring into our evenings
the quietude and restful spirit which so harmonized our
little gatherings that we cared little for the outside world
in the eventide.
Father sat happily by the fireside and read long lines
of poetry to us from Homer and Plato and other masters,
which to me were not at all attractive until father trans
lated their lines in charming manner and brought their
beautiful realities of heaven to earth in our midst.
These things were the mentors of our thoughts for the
coming days. Philosophy builds a world of truth in
which a man, however, may be blinded to the physical
needs of life, and take the part of a reactionary spirit
with Philosophy which may affect his being. Thus Phi
losophy became to us—Spiritual Thought.
The principles of cause and effect had little bearing
while father held the magic wand of hope before us; but
as he was a greater student than a business man, his busi
ness failed.
I knew naught about how to go out into the workaday
world; and this is another advantage that your populace
has over the olden days. Children are trained from
earliest infancy to meet the material contacts of life and
are prepared for buffs and rebuffs.
But we were exclusively sheltered, and I was trained to
be naught but a protegee, knowing absolutely nothing of
the practical issues of life outside of my home training.

172 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
It seemed a most important factor in the lives of my
parents to overstuff my head with the "osophies" of all
different natures.
Had this condition occurred in the present day and
time, perhaps my beloved parents would have been prose
cuted for cruelty to children for their confirmed belief
in the higher "isms" for their children in thinking stand
ards.
The trends of Religions I followed when old enough
to read for myself: learning so much about all Religions,
that I believed in none! I may say that Music was a
sort of Religion to me. There was a calmness of soul
which no physical concept could explain in the tones of
melody that we heard. And I believed in Holding that
Sacred which Calmed the Soul and carried it up to the
realms of God.
I felt music as closely as religious doctrines, and Poetry
and Philosophy seemed to be all the necessary constit
uents of life's religious basis. Music seemed my ideal!
Poetry was my thought! and Philosophy my life! —when
suddenly, I found myself facing a world of workday
strife.
So I must needs become a teacher and a writer that I
might help to supply the failing larder of life. It was a
vivid contrast to be cultivated to believe entirely in the
beautiful issues of life, and then suddenly face a poverty-
stricken, drab-looking world!
Especially was this condition desperate, for in those
days I saw the death of my beloved republic. Slavery was
at its height, and the persecution of religious beliefs so
utterly unspeakable in their punishments, that any poet
or author could obtain all the material needed for a TRUE
DESCRIPTION OF HELL.
I shall not detail what these punishments were, for the

TALITY'S THINKING EQUILIBRIUM might arise
out of the grave of cynical scorn, ignorance and bigotry;
and MAN MAY NOW WORSHIP IN HIS OWN IN
DIVIDUAL WAY!
Critics have said that John Milton had fits of insanity,
and this idea can be explained when I say that my ac
cumulations of impressions of the outer world, which I
was so untrained and unaccustomed to, came as an over
powering shock to the precepts instilled into my soul—
and my matrimonial tortures added to my discomforts.
Had I not been trained in the finest arts of appreciation,
courtesy and encouragement, perhaps I would not have
marred those historical pages of my critics with that part
of my life.
Man's highest success in life really is evident when he
reaches the age of forty years. What he may accumulate
in the way of standard living up to that time is on the
average his set pattern for all of life.
Thus the reactions of my bitter shocks and disappoint
ments were not sensibly construed; and thus you shall
find if you read over the data of my private life that there
was no wedded bliss—the greatest loss in life!
I had never studied women, hence I spoiled my Para
dise by my Inexperience, for I knew practically nothing
of feminine characteristics outside of my own family—
until the fatal knot was tied.
This additional failure shocked me profoundly, and
made of John Milton an uncertain spirit, a restless soul—
at the time when I wrote Paradise Lost. My heedless
losing of physical sight, and a young wife—unhappy and
miserable—who desired only the frivolous and shallow
things of existence, certainly did not help my tempera
ment and position.

manner, were prenatally born with souls of utter cold

ness; unfeeling reactions were their life. —And when a
home is bereft of all sympathy, it is very difficult for one
born with a crucially sensitive spirit to carry on success
fully to accomplish that which his nature cries out for
him to create.
In this period of my life and strife in the outer world
with which I came in contact every day, I persisted in
looking forth Hungrily for Consolation in my Home Sur
roundings. —But Nay! It was not there.
Now all this is not written to attract any sympathy for
myself, for I HAVE FOUND THE REAL PARADISE!
But I write these lines as a candid message and lesson to
the world, that they may avoid the very pitfalls into
which I fell, for it is the CHOICE OF EITHER
HEAVEN OR HELL.
LET YOUR SHIP OF SPIRITUALITY NOT BE
WRECKED! The finer the senses in the human con
struction, and the higher they are cultivated in child
hood, the more difficult it is for such a life to meet and
harmonize issues!
One may take a delicate rose and place it over a fire;
soon this rose will shrivel and show its unhappiness. And
this law of nature teaches humanity: that IT MUST
ASPIRE THROUGH ITS OWN EFFORT and shape
its own destiny: and not place before their feet the pit
falls which they may not have the courage and strength
to struggle out of.
And thus the most promising life may be made drab
and commonplace, when it may have been planned by the
Creator to be as brilliant as the rose of Sharon.
Now, having illustrated the footnotes of my experiences
in Heaven and Hell, I have been asked to speak along the
lines of your current question of Trial Marriages: per

a fallacy at the start in the face of Deity. Marriage is
first made in "spirit," not in any physical relationship of
life. It is the Spirits that are wedded—not the physical
bodies. And the spirits must be truly as ONE IN MIND
and SOUL Emanations if one looks for harmony and
happiness.
Otherwise relationships of matrimony start with but
the negative, or evil, forces at their beck and call. The
art of marriage is a study, not something to be hurried
into. It requires the most careful thought and considera
tion and concentration, or I should say, meditation.
Would the social world listen to their Intuitions as
important issues, your divorce courts would fade away
into oblivion. Incompatibility of temperaments are truly
the greatest average of complaints, and were this condi
tion corrected, humanity would know the true worth of
harmonious companionship, and the art of steering their
matrimonial barques over the rough waters of matri
monial riffles.
Happy marriages are made in heaven: meaning in
the Spirit of harmonious thought. But when a man is so
shortsighted and inexperienced and blind mentally, that
he contends to bring into his life a partner of Entirely
OPPOSITE NATURE, wherein no two ideas are visual
ized alike, there is contention of spirit, and a disgruntled
atmosphere.
The business of marriage is a science, and .there is no
higher study nor science. It is the one channel through
which the world's economic social standard may be ele
vated to the highest degree, and this issue is criminally
neglected.
The sex problem must again be made Something Di
vine—as once before in history —and most sacred before
the eyes of humanity, or Civilizations shall fall as Rome
fell in her soddenness.

I76 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
The ultimate rearing of minds to believe, that the rela
tionships of sex are the Creative Spirit of God's Plan, in
which His universal beauties may be best expressed is a
fallacy, and is not at all His true design for rowing the
barque of Unison in matrimonial cooperation and coordi
nation. His DESIGN IS LOVE, pure Love, clean Love,
wholesome Love, and LOVE O'ER ALL!
Until humanity shall awaken and reclaim the arid
desert they have made of God's Goodness, and Reclaim
Modesty from the Slums, Civilizations shall wane and de
generate.
Until humanity again know, that highest virtue should
be the path of matrimonial love, the Barque of Cupid
will be tossed about without ceasing upon the sea of in
ferior complexes and stormy cross waves of the rough
currents of life.
The idea of trial marriage is no law of God, but a
material convenience for mankind to satisfy selfish whims.
Romance, in its true colorings, manifests only a Sacred
Love and Self-sacrifice, that would not soil itself with the
fangs of iniquity.
LOVE, in all its beautiful truths, comes direct from
God, and is the UNIVERSAL SPIRIT-EXPRESSION
OF HEAVEN as near as any man may Realize Heaven
in temporal life and form. It is within humanity's judg
ment and reasoning powers to express this LOVE so that
one might truly feel to be in the PRESENCE OF GOD
Himself.
LOVE that is Debased starts from the Initiative of
Humanity's Inferior Complex, which is not under the
Spiritual Direction of the creative system. The Inferior
Complex is a dragnet to destroy all things high and holy;
and humanity must ever be on guard, that this trap of
Satan does not drag them down from their true magnetic

life: that of pure relationship allied with Spiritual Force.
Spirit is pure in all ideals and undented; and whoever
draws his temporal nature into the Defilement of life,
often BLAMES GOD for the resultant surroundings, but
this is only because he has been dragged away from the
Seat of his Best Judgment —The SPIRIT—and uncon
sciously has forgotten the Value of the Pure Spiritual
Workings.
By keeping forever Burning the PILOT LIGHT OF
THE SOUL— THE TRUTH OF ITS GUIDANCE, and
the PURITY OF ITS NATURE AS ONE'S SLOGAN,
ONE MAKES ALL FORWARD PROGRESS!
In believing in high social and economic standards only,
one may REACH OUT AND TOUCH THE STARS!
Such an one—through some unseen force—is able to
avoid the turmoil of earthly strife, and to keep his "pilot
light" burning in the most menial surroundings. It needs
only to be kept Lighted and Trimmed by SELF-DETER
MINATION.
There is no better critic in life for your purpose than
this "spiritual self"—that other invisible body within
you, talking to you; and which, in its natural dominion
SPEAKS ONLY OF PEACE! And in Cultivating this
True Inner Man, one does not at all cater to the physical
self, the outer shell, which may be Falsely Considered the
Life-giving force!
SELF-CONTROL IS THE GREATEST GIFT OF
GOD! and this is attained by learning to obey the ad
monitions of the Conscience QUICKLY, so as to dwell
with the Higher Vibrations that take deep meditation to
discover. Thus one naturally magnetizes himself, and
draws from Above the Force which is in Waiting from the
Spirit of Deity.
And this principle should be applied in the mating of a
man and a woman so that they mate not only in flesh.

i78 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
Mother was the SOUL of our Souls, for she understood us
all and created for us an earthly paradise.
No matter how high Spiritually one may be attuned to
the Infinite, if he does not find his Natural Spiritual Af
finity, there can never be the Soul-expansion in their
midst that God's Plan intended to be realized by them.
Unshapely dark shadows and doubts creep into human
ity's consciousness in spite of his spiritual guard. One
must have the sympathetic and trusting companionship
from an intimate, for this is the meaning of the word
"Paradise," in God's great book; ONE WHO LOVES
TRULY SEES BEYOND ALL BARRIERS, AND
BEARS, IN TRUTH, THE ONLY RELATIONSHIP
TO THE MIND OF GOD!
Paradise is not a place which God has so arranged that
man may there receive his reward, and lounge and browse
in idleness. It is a wide sphere of congenial spiritual in
telligence, lighted with the fires of Hope and Faith and
Understanding of the divine principles of life; a realm
with encouraging surroundings which inspire man to ac
complish all wonders of expansion. Would to God that
men paid more attention to their "pilot light of hope," and
prepared for this glory on earth, so as to have at their
right hand the thing most hoped for in their lives.
This true Paradise one may discover in one's individ
ual understanding, and carry on to the next Transition,
THE BELIEF AND KNOWLEDGE IN THE HIGH
EST PRINCIPLES OF LIFE; that which man ema
nates while on earth, he leaves as a lesson to a struggling
world left behind him.
And may I say before closing that man must not believe
in "ultimate blindness." It is a defect well understood
"over here" as belonging only to the physical world.

Mind-vibration only. The higher the Vibration of man's
nature the less he needs his physical eyes.
THE SOUL IS NEVER BLINDED ! Blindness is but
a material concept that holds something from physical
view. Thus it is a consolation to know that even if one
through some material blunder or disobedience to God's
laws has become materially blinded, he shall visualize
everything after coming "over here"; also that most of
the Vibrations of sight are received through the touch;
and that one does not necessarily need the physical eyes
as much as one really believes. The higher one is Tuned
to the Infinite, or can see into the "spiritual," the wider
one's vision of all things even in one's temporal form of
life.
To PROJECT THOUGHT MEANS TO ACCUMU
LATE THE THINGS DESIRED. Projection of human
thought goes out into space from the gland that is con
cealed above the eyes. It possesses a Magnetic, Electrical
FORCE.
If your physical eyes could visualize the aura of light
and color about your body, you would find, that your
world was inside of this Magnetic Force, or the Spiritual
radio flashes, which bring to you the pictures which you
visualize. And then these are arranged by your physical
brain cells and are formed to present a REALITY.
THOUGHT IS THE DEEPEST OF SCIENCES. If
man knew how to handle his thinking apparatus perfectly,
the world would be his and his acquaintance with God
would be complete. LOVE WOULD BE HIS LIFE!
Paradise would become an everyday existence: not some
thing to be found at the end of the earthly trail through
suffering and privation, sacrifices and penances.
Paradise is only made real, anywhere, when one en
compasses, through the Rhythm of his Mind-direction,

IN EVERYTHING AND EVERYWHERE— and that
His SPIRIT dwells in all things!
Now I thank you for being so patient and giving me so
much time, and I shall be pleased to answer questions I
see in your mind:
If "Paradise Lost" had not done so much good, I
should be sorry to have written
it,
because
I,
myself, BE
LIEVED IN A MATERIAL HELL! for
I
understood
every limitation of
it
in my material life, and of heaven
as well. My early years were lived in Paradise; my latter
years in Hell in my consciousness.
But
I
made this hell for myself, as all men do!
I
be
lieved in the negative trend of nature so completely that
it
became real to me, and drowned out the perfection of
my spirit. But my true soul finally escaped the clutches
of ignorance and misbeliefs, and
Ifound
a
place prepared
for me "over here," through mother's wisdom.
She
it
was who greeted me upon my entry into the
newer life. She held to her high principles and ideals,
and gradually drew me back to the Center of my Right
ful Path and the Spiritual Trend of my Soul. Thus
it
is
that one really never loses sight of PARADISE, no mat
ter how one suffers for his misconceptions,
if
he MEANS
RIGHT.
Now you are asking in your mind my idea of an in
ferior complex?
I
would define
it
thus:
(1) Disobeying the order of your own soul's com
mands and precepts;
(2) Becoming through cultivated bad habits,
a
slave
to your whims and weaknesses.
(3) Fear of criticism, when you are on the right path;
(4) Lack of tact;
(5) Lack of belief in one's self-ability. Man must
place faith in his own capabilities: in the ALL-

Forces of the "Intangible world," thus proving
the all-power of divinity to accomplish all things.
(I asked about auras or what colors we three dwelt
in:)
Shades of blue for you Lady Clara; they are a part of
your perfect vibrations of thought. THOUGHTS FLASH
OUT COLORINGS! Thought of Rage is RED. A
thought of Doubt is GRAY, which is not a spiritual color;
and thus one is out of touch with the Spiritual Ego of self.
This is what is termed to be "out of tune with the in
finite." It pays to understand the secret side of thinking
in relation to Spiritual Color Vibrations.
Father Behr's? (I think they went to see, they were
so long answering.) His colors are GREEN AND GOLD.
Green bears the true relationship of EFFICACY IN
LIFE. It is his true direction and first principle of mind
TO GROW AND EXPAND— to bring about SOME
THING NEW. Thus GREEN Attracts these Vibrations
to his midst. GOLD is the Richness of the results of his
efforts. The glory of his crown is the GOLD COLOR.
He shall find that the ethereal surroundings of the golden
hues resemble the sunshine and warmth of his nature.
Father Behr also, in his psychic moments draws the
outer colorings of VIOLET about him.
Mrs. Walters' are all along the shades of pale lavender
into violet. These are the shades that psychic natures
most project. AS ONE THINKS! different colorings are

Languages are natural "over here," we seem to bend
ourselves to any turn or relation of thought; and intelli

thus the linguist can feel at home "over here."
First I must pay my respects to my Reincarnation and
congratulate him upon the work which he is doing with
me. I claim much of the credit because I CAN WORK
WITH THE MIND of Herman Behr. He may seem to
think that he is not quite as versatile or learned as I ap

Mission of God in bringing to mankind the KNOWL
EDGE OF A FUTURE PERFECT DAY, when all Man
kind will be UNITED IN PURITY OF MIND WITH
GOD, and Recognize the hidden senses of the Master
mind, which DIRECTS THE INFINITE FORCES TO
PROPER DAILY USE; in so doing life will take on the
PERFECT COLOR OF HARMONY AND PEACE!
Now you have as the title for my letter of to-day:
THE POSSESSIONS OF GOD
Material possessions are essential to a creative material
life, and no man is really happy without the necessary
physical surroundings which make his body comfortable.
This seems to be a physical law, under nature's direction.
Money can buy countless things, but there is one ideal
in life which money cannot buy, and that is the SPIR
ITUAL VALUE OF LIFE, which is found only through
DIRECT COORDINATION WITH GOD THROUGH
MIND!
Possessions! Ah! I had many while in the flesh! For
almost eighty-four years I led a busy and interesting life;
but money did not purchase the Spiritual Possessions
which came into my soul: for LOVE CANNOT BE
BOUGHT. LOVE IS GOD! AND THE EMANA
TION OF THE HIGHEST CONCEPT OF THOUGHT,
directing the finer degree of Vibratory Force, which is
invisible to man.
Ah! How little did I really understand about the Vi
brations which my friend Elbert Hubbard instructed our
readers about. But how clear they seem to the Spiritual
Vision: really a part, or the "whole of the Spiritual Con
cept," as natural as breathing. Yet one must pass away
from all physical concept and barriers to fully understand
and appreciate this God-gift of life.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
There was much discussion concerning my theory of
colors, and I sought to explain it before a board of sci
entists who were diligently searching for the reason of
different vibrations; but that is not the subject I have
decided to speak about to my readers. I shall impart
more about this later.
Ah! The Divine Mind of God!— the Creative Spirit is
the Foundation of ALL POSSESSIONS, and all INTEL
LIGENCE WHICH COMES TO MAN—he knows not
wherefrom. It seems through a NATURAL INSTINCT
that some geniuses are destined to carry on the world's
work and develop new discoveries.
The answer to this is; because these Geniuses of Learn
ing were intuitively inspired from the Spiritual Source,
and had far outgrown the physical brakes of life, and
become real Possessors of their own Soul-force —WHICH
IS GOD EMANATING INTO ACTION! Thus the
finer traits of their characters were brought to light
through Progressive Illumination.
Goethe did not die with the physical body of Goethe,
but escaped that worn-out frame to do even a greater and
bigger work for God!
It seems but yesterday that I lived and loved and had
my earthly emotions and temperamental storms concern
ing events of the day. How strange that all that passed,
since coming into this "new life," which pictures itself so
vividly before my mind, that my wish is to tell all about
it;
also how
it

I

the "whole mind of the cosmos," having worked Reli
giously for God to Transform and Reform conditions
which Prevailed in my day; which have indeed improved
with time. We do not work as Individuals, but as

operating Spirit Force.

work of your world —in other words you may say that we
are—an army of busy men and women "over here."
Time means little. We need no rest. We need no food.
There seems to be only the CREATIVE MIND IN
WHICH WE EXIST, and that MIND, the CREATIVE
FORCE of God is in UNITY WITH US.
Yet apparently we have our homes in which to dwell,
and meeting places in which to convene and talk things
over. We have our gardens with Spiritual Flowers, and
birds and animals, just as you visualize them in your
surroundings, but more brilliant.
We are adorned with raiment: but it is not material
raiment such as is worn by the physical body, yet it suf
fices, for we feel neither cold nor heat—there being no
physical nerves through which to feel —nor a physical
brain to sense these Vibrations. Yet all VIBRATION
TO US IS KNOWLEDGE and for the Advancement of
KNOWLEDGE —through which we move and have our
being in the continuous Pulsating of Progress ; and we are
individually happy in working, for it seems our natural
trend.
And we can still look back upon our loved ones and
visualize the trend in which they experience life and In
spire them, through their "mind vibrations," to overcome
evil errors of the physical life, and make of their physical
experience a better one, through which they may Realize
the Beauties of the future !
Interested? Yes! We are greatly interested in your
affairs! It seems to be our Mission to DIRECT THE
SOUL OF MAN TO THE KINGDOM OF THE
FATHER.
Having had many different experiences in various lines
of interest in my earthly experience, I did not fall so far
away from these God-given possessions, for they were

As a scientist I had a fair beginning and I still work,
daily. Now I say "daily," yet what is "day over here"?
It is always day! —There is no darkness! at least I have
never experienced any—if it exists.
In my scientific research work I aspire to create in man

body will be able to send his thoughts long-distance —one
to another—through knowing how to handle the ELEC

As a botanist I delighted in that pastime. My hobby,
as those who have read my early history will know, was
the remodeling of trees and shrubs: making their limbs
droop if I did not wish them to stand; or forcing them
to stand erect if I did not wish them to droop—also to
give them new color and form.
Ah ! How I have enjoyed this Re-creative Pastime with
Luther Burbank in remodeling your flowers of modern
times. And now Luther Burbank and I Spiritually plan
new discoveries for your world.
As a collector! Ah! How I loved the hobby. Why I
had this desire I never knew while in the mortal body:
but it had an uncanny fascination for my soul. It was

God's children to collect the many precious stones. Each
has a special meaning, and I am still especially interested
in them —not of course for their material value, but to
preserve beauty on God's earthly domain.
As to Philosophy, that work gave me great pleasure,
because this Wisdom to me, seemed to come from God.
And now I know that in a Philosopher's life, God speaks
through his soul.
As to writing, I could not quite understand this craving
in life. "Faust" penetrated my whole existence, having
been inspired through dreams, or in some land which I
seemed often to travel to. I thank God that "Faust" still
lives and BECOMES MORE Spiritually Understood with
the decades: for in Dr. Faustus MY WHOLE EARTHLY
PERSONALITY LIVES. It is like a reference book to
me.
Of other writings I had many. Herman Behr knows
them all, because that same mind which was in Goethe
also exists in Herman Behr: as these Memories cling to
his Soul-consciousness, he is naturally attracted to the
study of my writings.
In my lifetime I had a particular fondness for a great
writer of my day whom I admired as I would a son, Lord
Byron, and to-day we inspire other writers who live upon
your world plane, to create as great writings as came
through us in our earthly experiences from the Infinite
Source of God.
Spiritual possessions are precious stones sparkling in
the coronet of mankind: I may call them Auras of the in

possessed of these two God-gifts and to help perfect

and how Gladly would I have Died for Lili (Schoene-

Women! God bless them. They are indeed God's fair

Not love for lust, nor love for conquest: but a Spiritual

Love never dies, for LOVE IS THE SPIRITUAL VI

and no man loves for naught! There is Purpose and
Progress behind all Love.
Ah! What more could I not have accomplished had I
had Lili for my own! for Love is Inspiration and the
Fire of the Soul, where divine Happiness is created in life
—and all the world seems akin!
If a perfect thought is brought to life and held when
once born in the soul, and LOVE awakens anew in the
Ethereal Experience —old Loves come to Light! Imme

him to take all the time he wished.) In physical life I
was much interested and absorbed in Astronomy. The
Vastness of the Cosmos seemed an Appalling Weight upon

Ah! How I wish I could have said more! Could I but
have told the people of the world that each bright and
brilliant Star was a world in the making, or an inhabited
world. —How vast is life!
The SPIRIT IS DIVISIBLE: and I am living again in
a body upon your earth, because my work was not com
plete when I left your Sphere. The Law of Vibration,
working in cycles, brought me back again until my mis
sion is fulfilled. Then I shall pass into another and
Higher Spiritually constituted planet, where another
world-life will begin in a higher System of Creation than
that which man may experience upon your planet.
There is no limit to knowledge! and no limit to time!
They cannot be measured. Create for yourselves, dearly
beloved mortals of earth, a passion for knowledge. It
means your entire progress. Do not cram the brain: it
can but carry a certain load; then physical Limitations
shatter it to bits.
Learn the Art of Concentration and Spiritual Develop
ment of the Soul? These are God-possessions, through
which MAN moderately develops into a higher being.
"There is no death": unless you should desire to call
the changing of the chrysalis to the butterfly "death";
for such is your experience when you pass out of one
form of life into a more beautiful and magnificent one. It
is but a natural change which man passes through.
So fear not! Delight in this Transition when your
earthly work is fulfilled. Those cutting down the life of
youth are murderers of mortal minds!
But there shall come a time when each individual will
be able to handle the elements with which he is surrounded
so well, that he can overcome the "reaper" who untimely
cuts off the life of youth; and each and every individual
shall experience a long life into deep old age, when grad

aration from her I left England forever, and returned not
permanently until I was in the spirit.
However my isolation from my own country gave to
me a wealth of experience in travel through Germany,
Switzerland, France, Italy, and elsewhere; and from
these shores most of my works were written.
And George Gordon Byron was not as bad as reformers
love to mouth and paint him. Henry Ward Beecher gives
me credit for this. But, you see, my example in parents,
my pride, my deformity, and my emotions, all withered
my life, and I just endeavored to blind my feelings in a
devil-may-care, free life. Miss Milbanke so falsely scan
dalized me that she started something that has never
ended.
Countless scandal mongers have had it that I gambled
and drank and associated with fast company, exclusively.
Be it as it may, my life, or that of my associates was
nothing to compare with the age in which society revels
in this day and time. We were, as you Americans would
term
it,
"absolutely tame"—to your day.

over seeming hurts and slights, and Bitter Criticism,

so. If

I
do not know what would have happened to me.

192 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
Evidently I inherited much of my temperamental dis
abilities from my father also. However, "Lambra,"
which was the nickname for my mother, gave to me the
poetical ideals through which my sensitive soul so suf
fered and succeeded.
To begin with, my father was a ne'er-do-well, and my
childhood days were replete with scenes and difficulties
relating to my parents' distresses which preyed vitally
upon my over-sensitive nature, and I, too, suffered un
told agonies through their differences.
Then, from my early boyhood, marked attention was
paid to my deformity, which caused me often to hide be
hind my mother's skirts. This deformity was a sort of
inverted foot, caused by some one displacing my ankle
joint at my birth. This caused my limb to shrink some
what, giving me quite a marked limp.
All this is perhaps known to history, but I still wish it
to be understood, that I was not as crippled as the press
would persist in having me. The dislocated ankle joint
was never set from infancy, consequently the fore part of
my foot hung down, and the heel shrunk in, and I walked
on the fore part of my foot.
The Hurt was not so much to me for I was accus
tomed to
it,
but
I
grew up with the sensitive feeling that
all eyes were upon it. In later years this feeling almost
entirely passed away, except that the press persisted in
writing scathingly about it.
I
do not speak morbidly of this:
I
merely mention
it
to
set this part of my being aright. And there are no cripples
and there
is
no deformity in Eternity! The body of the
physical man
is
but the shell in which he passes through
one stage of his existence; and
a
long existence
it
is; so
lengthy that its Origination cannot be traced back by the
individual himself. We, "over here," are permitted to

look back into our past lives, and we see ourselves as we
lived in the last issue of life.
Memory evidently is limited —but through what growth
of nature I have not yet, nor has anyone else, fathomed
it. Apparently it is just a law of nature. The REAL
MAN who enters into the Spiritual Existence comes in
perfection of bodily form in Spirit Ethereal Relation.
The only information that I might make plain to the
reader of these LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
is,
to
say, that ofttimes the mind—which
is
the entire REAL
ITY of the person—or that Soul-force of the Creative
Spirit which reaches eternity —
is
MORE DEFORMED
THAN ANY PHYSICAL BODY COULD POSSIBLY
BE.
A
deformed spirit
is
an abortion before God.
I
had
not the perfect soul in many trends. The Poetic Force in
me was the perfect thing, and my outstanding merit to
ward progress,—however, my relations had to be thor
oughly adjusted to meet the perfect Condition "over
here."
One special topic which
I
feel inclined to clarify is
—
regarding marriage! True Love causes
a
Union of Spirits,
and True Love Marriages are made in heaven from the
Heavenly State of Consciousness. Thus, when Love
is
true,
it
Abides in God, no matter what conditions, relating
to Man-made laws, might have been set for this union in
its transitory state of being.
No man shall reach the day when wedlock
is
banished
according to established law, for
it
is
a condition which
balances morality and must stand as read. SPIRITUAL
ITY must be upheld in its highest degree
!
If the Bonds
of Wedlock were stricken from man-made laws, Morality
would Commit Suicide.

made ideals! One may overdo any gift or commodity,

even in Spiritual Perspectives. The "Spirit-source of life"
is presumably unlimited; yet the Physical Being in a cer
tain relation to a thing, cannot keep pace with its Spiritual
Relationship. This is proven by so-called "death" —the
Spirit finally winning the race; and the physical body
giving up the struggle in exhaustion, returns to its origi
nation.
According to earthly standards Moderation is the high
est ideal of life. There must be Moderation in all things,
lest man's ideals be crumbled to dust. God wills, that
man shall think, and meditate, and recognize the useful
ness of his reasoning powers !
It is always obviously noticeable, that when Modera
tion is not abided by, the Individual loses his BALANCE
WHEEL, and then enters into various states of insanity;
and it will be another Consolation to my readers, that
there is no Insanity in Eternity, for this is entirely a
physical disability. At release from the earthly body the
mind is freed from its distorted state, and finds rest, peace
and happiness "over here."
Various forms of insanity are caused by toxins in the
blood: some are Hereditary, while others arise from dif
ferent individual relationships in life—others are caused
by diseased nerves, their centers all connecting with the
Soul-consciousness, or Solar-plexus, wherein man reaches
his height of Divine Energy and Spiritual Relationship.
Should this be the case, Tranquillity of Being is com
pletely demoralized, perhaps also by some severe shock
to the nervous system, which the individual himself could
have been trained to prevent in knowing how to avoid this
derangement. Man cultivates insanity to a great extent
on his own behalf in over indulging his nervous system,
which is the finest masterpiece of God.

those Ethereal and Invisible Cells which superintend all
issues of the "mind-direction of mankind." So Self-
control and Moderation in all things should be man's
Ideal in life, for the nerves and the mind bear upon his
Direct Relationship with Deity, and PROCLAIM THE
PRESENCE OF THE ALMIGHTY GOD WITHIN
HIM.
I know your thoughts, that my talk is very serious, but
these are issues that the public often ponder over, and I
wished to explain my lineage and my deformity, that peo
ple might better understand my sensitive pride and un
fortunate start in life.
Even your little minister said in church last evening
that "Byron was club-footed" (which he did). Now
my foot was not deformed. I wore the same sized shoe
on each foot, except that my shoes were made to order in
those days. There was this enforced thickness through
the ankle because of the deformed joint, and there had to
be a width of leather through the ankle giving me truly
the appearance of being club-footed. I should not be
sensitive about this, but I wish it to be understood.
I passed from earth in Greece, and was refused cordial
reception as to my remains being placed in Westminster
Abbey because of my freedom of life and spirit in my last
chapter. Yet it did not matter to me what happened to
the shell in which I dwelt in life's form.
Is it not strange how meaningless the body is after the
soul flees from it? Yet when in life one so dotes on this
physical possession as one's greatest dominion : then in the
flash of an eye it is all forgotten as if it had never be
longed to one, when the Soul blossoms out of its chrysalis
into the "higher life,"—where only the Spiritual Wealth
is fully realized.

life I loved poetry, so, naturally, I am still drawn to the
realms where poetry is all of one's creative surroundings,
and everything I visualize breathes a poem —not a Physi
cal but a Spiritual Poem.
Rhythm is the lasting ethereal fountain-head of God,
and poetry together with music are the highest Vibrations
"over here." It seems that Poetry and Music are akin,
and part of our individuality and natural life.
There are gardens which no human mind could con
ceive of in delicate colorings, so outstanding, that each
tiny petal reflects an Aura. The prevailing colors appear
to be of the yellow and golden shades, which are the In
signia of Happiness. And I presume this is where some
of the Psychics of Bible days received their idea of golden
"streets in heaven."
We have livelier than earth colorings "over-here," espe
cially the sparkling glittering golds. The height of color
ings in our flowers reflect delicate shades of pinks and
lavenders, so delicately defined that even the Spiritual
Mind must emanate and develop their Visibility through
the highest vibrations.
To visualize color is but to Develop one's sense of Vi
bration. Do you know that one person sees the coloring
in a flower differently than another? This is true. No
two people truly visualize the colorings alike. There is
always a few degrees difference; and the higher the men
tality of a person, the higher is his Thought Vibration and
Visibility. One must tune in with the Infinite to realize
the glories of colorings!
Thus in the "spiritual areas" wherein we dwell, we find
constantly new delights in discovering higher degrees of
delicate colors. There is always a new force being de
veloped in us as we ourselves develop "over here."
Our scenery may be said to be somewhat like that of

the Cosmos. We enjoy the fragrance of our flowers and
the magnitude of the sceneries which may resemble your
own, except that ours is of ethereal nature, while yours
is physical.
Man never loses sight of nature's surroundings!
Though he may pass from the physical life—he will find
the Grandeur of God even more gorgeous and beauteous,
according to the manner in which he befits himself to
reign "over here"— and individually, MIND IS THE
SUM AND SUBSTANCE OF ALL THINGS!
After coming "over here," one more fully realizes the
Potentialities of God, though these are only realized
through the art of higher thinking and developing the
VISION OF THE SOUL.
I do not believe that one-half of mortality know the
meaning of the word "IDEALS." IDEALISM means to
reach the HEIGHT OF GOD-POTENCY in THOUGHT
and ACTION, whereby life is expressed in the highest
degree, of its physical senses.
This is EVIDENTLY THE IMPORTANT FACTOR
OF EVER HAVING ANY LIFE TO LIVE!
This is man's INTENDED MANIFESTATION: and
the longer it takes him to work out this problem pertain
ing to SELF VERSUS GOD while in his temporal state of
being, the longer he shall find it will take him to Realize
PERFECTION in HEAVEN.
Thus by neglecting one's perfect work while in the
physical state, man will find himself as the boy at school
who has neglected his class-work. HE HAS TO MAKE
IT UP before he may pass into the next grade and com

ing to its born creative pattern. This explains why I saw
no beauty in da Vinci's paintings. I was born without
an eye for the finest art, and was ofttimes criticized be
cause I failed to appreciate Leonardo da Vinci's beau
tiful works.
To me these paintings were actually drab and mean
ingless: and I could no more have harmonized color into
these formations than I could have grown wings with
which to fly.
Thus, parents must come to the conclusion that each of
their offsprings should BEAR THEIR OWN IDEAL,
and try to discover what this ideal
is,
and help them to
magnify
it,
that they build and eventually have an
abounding soul for God.

to advance, and to-day, together, we bring color and

doing an individual and a beautiful work. It is delightful
to be together in the company of these great minds and
talk over things relating to our conditions in poetical
terms.
You of the physical relation would feel entirely out of
place. I really find it difficult to come back to your fire
side and talk in this commonplace way. Our natures
seem to have a defined relationship, bearing almost no
relation to your physical expression.
Perhaps it is because we have become so accustomed
to this newer life. However, I find a marked improve
ment in your literary world befitting the age in which
it is expressed.
The splendor and beauty of poetry shall ever live and
be the fundamental foundation of thought in its celestial
meaning. I do really admire your practical poetry of the
day, where men believe in each other.
Genius has no special privilege, and is given to no
chosen ones of God. Man is discovering, that his SOUL
IS THE UNIVERSAL GENIUS and needs but the Cul
tivation of Expression. Man merely stumbled on his
genius by accident in the time when I dwelt amongst you.
Man is now finding more delight in LIVING through
discovering that his ideals and individual pattern are
truly inspired by God, and is reaching the apex of his
spiritual equilibrium. In doing so, the PHYSICAL
STATE of the world's reaction SHALL PASS FROM
RULING.
There shall be a finer and higher degree of principle
placed upon all issues of life within the next decade!
Humanity are indeed tired of the vulgar, slip-shod ex
pression of life, and the superman is fast coming into
his own reality —through Scientific Research of the
MIND—and its Purpose in FULFILLING ITS DE
SIGN IN LIFE as God intended it should.

200 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
Strange it is how many years it has taken human men
tality to discover the true and practical EXPRESSION
OF THE SIMPLE CHRIST-LIFE, where it is REAL,
and not a fantastic myth of the imagination. A REAL
ITY, nevermore to be destroyed, for ITS TRUTH IS
NOW SUBSTANTIATED.
And I, as one amongst you at one time, NOW LIVE,
AND MOVE, AND HAVE MY BEING in your midst!
We are taking active part in all poetical themes on your
earth, trying to inspire writers. For whatever a man's
ideals exemplify, they become a part of the UNIVERSAL
EXPRESSION OF GOD! Thus our efforts at least are
never lost to view.
You wish to know the location of my eternal home?
I dwell much of my time (if you will excuse me for saying
"time" for there is no time "over here"—we have no limi
tations, being constituted in "ethereal force" we forever
vibrate grace and glory) in Venus, which is the chosen
heaven for the poet.
The place has no limitation. Never think that eternity
is in any way limited. The title of the Book of Life is
IDEALITY— Its STORY is the IDEAL MOTHER
who gives man such life that he may visualize God, who
alone is the BEAUTY OF IDEALISM, which is the Po
tency of man's deliberations. . . . And now, when look
ing over my life, remember my words:
"And Power of Love, I cannot share,
But wear the chain."
My bosom was not as false as the world deemed it to
be; and "In His hand is my heart and my hope."
The soul of man is his Record, in which all the Poetry
of his life is Recorded to be read.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 201
Henry Ward Beecher: / have for you this morning
one whom the world has never reproached for his "flying
chips": a sculptor of art and renown.
MICHELANGELO BUONARROTI
1475-1564
Cultivate the Artistic Sense of Your Soul
"Ladies, I am called Michelangelo, but that was never
my name. Correctly it is Michelagnolo Buonarroti. It
was changed to Michelangelo by others because of a
"cupid" which I carved. I was called "Michel, the
Angel," and just from that Michelangelo originated. I
always resented this salutation, for I was very far from
being an angel in temperament, and felt it rather as a
reproach or unearned.
Artistic people rarely are beautiful outwardly or in
action; being so intent upon their spiritual relationships
—they have little time to concentrate upon good manner
isms and courtesies —in which I was considered rather
unlearned.
In my day there were special favorites amongst the
artists. Leonardo da Vinci and myself were special
friends, but his work dealt more with the paint brush, his
pictures were light and frolicsome and earthly. He
gained popularity much more readily than I did, who,
through some unseen force, dealt more with another
world than yours.
I often wondered if my inspiration did not depict a land
of which some day I would eventually be a part; but
I have found that my inspiration, which dealt most with
subjects of piety, came largely from INTUITION related
to religious viewpoints.

202 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
However my work, as one may yet view it in places of
renown, much resembles our Statuary in Eternity. There
is,
in reality, statuary "over here," and since "coming
over"
I
have originated much of grandeur. Our statuary
deals largely along subject lines pertaining to intellect
and not so vividly concerning the material moods of man
as in the physical world.
There are duplicates of statues and paintings "over
here" exactly like those upon your physical plane, and
I
may explain this by saying that certain artists and
sculptors have brought their ideals with them "over here"
and duplicated their work, that they might not be di
vided from that which was
a
part of their nature.
Of course, the statuary and paintings of eternity do
not consist of material matter; but when one gazes at
them they bear
a
remarkably close resemblance to solids.
One could indeed believe that they really were statues
moved over—but no! They are made of the same
Ethereal Substance through which we also are a living
part.
I
should like to explain all this more vividly to you, and
that you will never lose sight of the things you love on
earth whatever they may be. Your own originality brings
with
it
the beauties pertaining to your mental relation
ships, and places them before you.
If one
is
a
genius in any special art, he becomes
a
"liv
ing part of that purpose." —Therefore, instead of leaving
his work AS SOMETHING FINISHED on earth, he
finds, that
it
is
lacking in details, which are to be added
after he comes into his eternal home.
There are many "spiritual details" which the physical
eyes somehow have not caught, and later on can see the
defects, that the physical eyes could not visualize. One's
mind
is
not perfect when one first comes "over here" and
one realizes that
it
must be perfected to assure Spiritual

Thus one of artistic temperament shall find Work be
yond their physical ken, and continue upon it when
they arrive "here." One would believe that after over
seventy-five years of labor on sculpture, paintings and
fresco work—I had deserved a rest—that I would be
rewarded by sitting in some specially prepared seat of
glory—to look back upon my labor, and enjoy the pleasure
of others' admiration when they gaze at Michelagnolo's
productions.
Nay! Nay! My friends. My work seems only to
have begun! For how many more years the spirit mind
cares not! You count time according to the years, but
they have no meaning in the land of "spiritual growth,"
for I found that in my devotion to my chosen ability, the
earthly experiences through which I had the pleasure of
enjoying many long years of origination and richness of
accomplishment, were only "stepping stones" to my future
endeavors.
In no other channel could my soul be tranquil, unless
it continued on in its chosen pattern; and thus I have
spent my time decorating the cathedrals of heaven —and
creating statues far superior to any that physical eyes
have gazed upon.
Also, I have worked to INSPIRE THE MIND
CENTERS of mankind who aspire for artistic ability.
Especially have I enjoyed my experience with interesting
careers since the days of your last war, and have helped
to recreate many of the masterpieces of old so ruthlessly
demolished by carnal hands.
I know that humanity cannot fully realize yet, nor have
they evolved an answer, as to why the last war was so
crushingly rendered. We "over here" call it a last chal

And since those days there has grown and shall con
tinue to grow, as a Realization of the lesson to prevent
future strife and misunderstandings between nations, the
FOLLY OF SUCH MATERIAL CONQUESTS! The
war however taught humanity to place a higher value
upon the WORLD OF ART AND SCIENCE!
And thus out of all disaster, though it means the sacri

And thus one may easily understand the JUSTICE OF
GOD, and the Omnipotence of HIS building up a superior
world through the Experiences of past masters; and the
Experiences of to-day are to be an added part to all
accomplishment.
Any man may be individual in his efforts if he but adds
a unit to the endeavors of others to build up a superior

SPIRITUAL VISUALIZATION! is like gazing on a

the simple love of a child —or the kiss of a true sweet
heart.

of their lives a LIVING THING OF SPIRITUAL
WORTH. Not a dead and cold status into which most
individuals shape their lives.
The most important faculty of genius, and of cultivat
ing the higher vibrations of life, is to formulate in the
mind the habit of being ENTHUSIASTIC and full of
Animation ! Lack of interest is the cause of loss of many
a laurel wreath on earth! but "over here," through all
the countless years, I have discovered, that each individual
is still working for laurels! Not in the way of self-satis
faction, nor self-centered egotism, but for the "laurel"
that bespeaks the true principles of heaven! In other
words, it is the evident occupation of his mind to SPIR
ITUALIZE all that it may contact or adhere to.
Thus anyone may through this established purpose dis
cover that in his temporal body there is a field of action
and a chosen work to be accomplished. I have observed
in my study of human character that no individual is in
truth happy until he discovers the Spiritual Side of his
life, WHICH IS HIS GIFT FROM GOD! Through this
Realization he arises to the zenith of his success.
The first evident touch of regret that comes to the
soul upon coming into this new life, is when one realizes
how little one really has accomplished in one's physical
reign of thought, for each human ego bears its mark of
genius ! And if that mark of genius is not brought out in
one's life, it is not running on its true orbit! and thus man
must keep on endeavoring until he accomplishes the thing
aspired for and in such a manner that no one could de
scribe it unless he called it his line of duty.
But cannot one believe, when gazing at some human
derelict, that he may only have lost track of his spiritual
ego through some wanton weakness of material life ! And

carnal nature, under which it struggles through man's
inability to DO and to THINK for himself, MAN may
find his TRUE IDEAL, and perchance live a better life
in his next Reincarnation, and what he has not fulfilled he
shall fulfil in heaven.
However, there is much to be learned before one may
fulfil one's ideals in HEAVEN— I say HEAVEN— mean
ing the ETHEREAL UNIVERSE OF TRANSCEN
DENTALISM —Heaven can have no other description.
To be God-like, one must cultivate in mind the ideal
of developing the DIVINE EGO within one's body
wherein the "ethereal life" is lived in the physical state
with the God-originality of principles as founded upon
your earth plane.
Had Michelagnolo lived a life of frivolity and shal
lowness in his day, there would not have been these last
ing marks of religious art-growth established on your
plane. Michelagnolo's works were but a lesson for
greater masters to come who have not yet completed
their supreme life-work.
There shall be, through the Era of "Spiritual Realiza
tion," another advent of artistic souls, that shall surpass
any accomplishment which has so far met human eyes.
As one gazes at the artistic beauties of your world this
may seem difficult to believe; yet human art is but in its
infancy!
There is no limitation to accomplishment since man
now has the KEY TO SPIRITUALITY! Man really
worked for art's sake alone in my time, and in the fif
teenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and strove ac
cording to his moods, not knowing their significance; but
in later centuries men have, in truth, felt the God-force
working with them and have known that through some
Invisible Force urging them, they were accomplishing
their endeavors.

for art, a genius of the past had no smooth road to travel.
To-day men are gods in themselves through having all
necessary materials, and centuries of instruction at their
finger tips; thus they may easily fulfil any desired effect.
I cannot forget, how a pope, who idolized art for art's
sake alone, aspiring for what might commemorate his
memory, through the building of fine statuary, besought
me to carve immense statues for a cathedral.
The marble, of course, had to be quarried in the moun
tains. There were no appliances of your present practi
cal age to start with, with which to quarry such vast
blocks of marble. The great blocks were slowly chiseled
out and brought away. There was no powder to loosen
them at that time, as man has mastered since.
Long, long, did I carve and chisel on one statue, and
finally sent word to the pope, that thereafter my address
would be Florence. Such a massive statue as he desired—
produced through storms and vacillations —could not have
been moved in any event, as there were no adequate
means for its transportation.
But this was ultimately reduced to a lesser form and
completed in a "statue of Moses." This commission was
given to me by the pope to test my ardor and ability, and
thus I was later given the commemorative work of help
ing to decorate St. Peter's Cathedral in Rome.
My favorite work in that cathedral is named "Piety,"
representing "faith in God." The special masterpiece of
the "Creation" in the Vatican is a Spiritual Illumination
of Eternity.
All men are great who strive to do their work well, live
in God's Plan and help to create a world of splendor and
harmony: THEIR LINE OF ENDEAVOR MATTERS

happened that upon completion of a certain piece I was
standing by and heard a discussion between two men.
Finally the honors for this piece were given to Lorenzo,
and this so astonished me, that it should be so mistaken
for his work—when it was to my mind so different from
his style—that I slipped into the cathedral at night and
carved my name upon it.
Afterwards I regretted this action and never again
put my name upon my work. My spirit seemed to assure
me that my work was individual and distinctive, and I
believed in my own genius —rather an egotistical view!

CANNOT HAVE PRIDE IN GOD! You should mag
nify this saying in large letters, for it is Omnipotent to
mankind, and the staff that shall lead him and bear the

My friends: Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael and Lorenzo
among them, were renowned as having much to do in
the feminine world of thought. But Michel, the "Angel,"
was too busy to notice womankind —yet, Ah! what would
life be without LOVE ! I believe even a Secret LOVE is a
Sacred LOVE, in which the SPIRIT sometimes best
speaks.
Love did not come into my life in early years, yet
made my latter years rich in spiritual essence. "Vit-
toria"! considered an eccentric old woman, cared for and
comforted me in my declining years, and was my LOVE.
Together we stole into the gloom of the cathedrals of
Florence, and sat on the benches near one of my statues,
and together exchanged consoling words over the vicissi
tudes of life; not in the "ecstasies of youth" which bubble
up and fade away, but with a "true love" that passeth all
understanding —as if the GOD OF LOVE had reached out

and promised a Resurrection and greater life to come. —
AND IT HAS COME TO PASS!
Though Vittoria and I were not wed on earth, "spirit
ually" we were wed! And, "spiritually," we, united,
still believe in the supreme delight of art and its Ethereal
Relationships to HIGHER THOUGHT, WHICH IN
TRUTH IS OF GOD.
Art, alone, cannot be related merely to the piece of
stone, or canvas, with which it is associated in the thought
of man. Each individual is an artist in HIS OWN DE
SIGN OF THOUGHT. It matters little whether he puts
that thought in colors, or in curves.
The lifework of the true artist is spent in Shaping
Beauty, that others may profit thereby, as Stepping-stones
to Religion and Spirituality, in which the Visualization
of Deity's Inspiration may forever be brought to view!
There is just as much merit given on the day of man's
judgment by the Almighty Power to one, who, in an
artistic sense may leave a line of prose or poetry behind
him as a guiding step for mankind. There is just as much
beauty and a goal for those who Commemorate a TRUTH
OF DIVINITY— whether it be by word of mouth or by
action! —whether it be by the expansion of a smile, or
the wiping away of another's tears!
At the present time we are aspiring toward reestab
lishing in the minds of men the GOD-VALUES IN
LOVE! Love-standards are now obviously low because
of man's material greed and coarseness, and the fast-
moving world in which he struggles to find his TRUTHS.
However plans are being made "over here" to AGAIN
IMMORTALIZE STATUARY as one measure toward
Refinement. I shall give the time and place, also the
name of the most prominent subject, but I shall not give
the name of the master who shall do a "wonderful work

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 211
The time shall be 1933, the place shall be Chicago, and
the subject of the masterpiece of statuary, created to
awaken a world of thought, shall be called "LOVE." The
sculptor is my "Reincarnation," and I am coming back
to establish this work, IF THE CARNAL FORCES OF
EARTH do not drive me away.
Now I trust, that I have given some aid toward "new
thought" in this letter, and am pleased to analyze for
you the picture you have here for this purpose: (Christ's
Entry into Jerusalem, by Plockhorst). If you read your
Bible you may also analyze it easily.
The characters represented are evidently TRUE
CHARACTERS that took part in the event. The clouds
in the background represent the coming storm, meaning
the misconceptions of conscience concerning the condi
tions under which the Christ put forth His promise to
the people. In other words the storm Pictures "Evil
days."
The palms represent His eventual triumph. The doves
represent peace for Him at last. The archway represents
the small aperture of hope he might have. The small
palm in the archway represents a little of His present
triumph. The children represent His hope for happiness
to the newer generations through His teachings.
You will notice that there are a few who are listening
intently for a word from Him: these represent the spir
itual concentration of a few upon life's beauties. The
woman standing represents "Motherhood" —or all that is
of God and beautiful. She has her face thrust forward
as if ready to meet any circumstance.
The old men in the background represent sages and
prophets of old who believed in the NEW DAY to come.
The woman with the children upon her lap represents
"protection and security." (I said I had never heard
of Plockhorst before.)

everything. Were it not so, how could so many of us
return, and manifest their original characteristics. How
can any one NOW DENY SPIRIT RETURN? IT IS
LIFE; The Continuation of an Infinite Story whose
TITLE IS ETERNITY!
Now here comes a Master of the Past into the room,
and I do wish you could see his beautiful face of divine
beauty, and the SOUL OF A GOD. He left many master
pieces behind kim.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 213
I came to earth in Urbino, in a tiny stone hut with a
red-tiled roof, a most insignificant place it was at that
time, but now on the door of that same little hut is a small
tablet bearing proof that Raphael Sanzio once dwelt there
with father and mother.
There have been many questions concerning a certain
painting on the wall of that tiny sanctuary of a mother
and child, and the world has never truly known its origin.
So I, at the start, am pleased to say that it was the handi
work of my dear father, Giovanni Sanzio, for he painted
mother and her infant child, Raphael.
It is fading with the flight of years, yet the SPIRIT of
FATHER is in it as well as the SPIRITS of the mother
and child; for when the SPIRIT OF LOVE is placed in
a work of art, it is there permanently. Father was ever
profoundly grateful for every blessing bestowed upon
him, and the DIVINE LOVE in our family, between
father, mother and child constituted soul unity. Thus
father wished to perpetuate THIS LOVE upon the walls
of his abode, in grateful reverence to One who had so
blessed him.
The little village is not so different from what it was in
my childhood days, and I am still there in Spirit, for I
ofttimes linger where I was born to life, and the things
about are dear old associates and memories of those days
of PERFECT LOVE! It is sleepy, quiet, restful and
beautiful for the spirit.
I do hope that some day you will visit this place I so
love, and think of me whom you know as Raphael. The
white pigeons are still there in numbers floating through
the air and feeding at the doorsteps. How I love them
as I watch them as of yore. Their coos and simple as
surance of safety and protection are still so manifest.
The flower venders sit by the doorways selling fra
grant mignonette and herbs for the traveler's recompense,

and similar flower girls were picturesque in the days of
Raphael Sanzio. The shoe cobbler is still there who now
"Mends shoes while you wait." Ofttimes as a boy I
visited an old shoe cobbler and handed nails to him while
he expounded his simple philosophy of life.
Ah! These memories of Love and Kindliness! They
LAST FOREVER, for the SPIRIT OF GOOD embraces
ALL WISDOM! And NATURE IS BUT A SYM
BOLISM OF SPIRIT nor can the most carnal individ
uality crush its similitude to BEAUTY! So here I am to
give to the world what the world gave to me.
This knowledge is best expressed in words as I cannot
come and paint these pictures in the physical sense on
earth; but "over here" I paint on and on, just as of yore
through the HANDS of OTHERS, who, too, MIRROR
THE SOUL.
The Exposition of LOVE and BEAUTY has no Limita
tions, but may be expanded into its BASIC SPIRIT by
Thought Power ! So in depicting the real depth of life's
beauties upon canvas, one must paint into the glories of
that canvas "one's very soul" as well as the beauty of the
subject—otherwise the muse sings the song of material
reflection only, instead of that perfection which shows
the true God-voice within the artist's bosom.
All Originality is really the Outbursting of LOVE'S
EGO! The SOUL MUST HAVE A PASSIONATE DE
SIRE TO CREATE before a marvel may be accomplished
at its highest and best. To HEAR FROM WITHIN
ONE the CALLING OF THE SOUL, and to OBEY
THAT VOICE spells success. One does not so much
need professional art, but rather to capably expound those
raptures—as if Deity were working through the brush.
Every artist is but a medium in his day and time —
for the Outpouring of the SUPERMIND. One has but
to give the world a True Love-offering of those Inspiring

Aspirations which struggle through man for delineation.
God grant that the vast human Egotism shall shrivel
away, and the True, Divine Inspiration of the ORIGI
NAL PATTERN FOR EACH MAN be truly manifested
through intelligent direction.
ALL POWER of WISDOM comes from the MIND
WITHIN THE MAN, and not through outside contact.
It is the bursting out into flower of the "Seed of the
Soul." Most individuals COPY WISDOM FROM
OUTER CONTACT, thus becoming more akin to the
Material Ardor in each cycle of progress. Wisdom is the
result of life-concepts and the offspring of Mother Nature.
True inspiration all centers back to the DIVINE
CREATIVE SPIRIT, and if man takes into account his
original created identity, he can never become lost in the
maze of world perplexities, for each man was CREATED
TO CARRY ON SOME ONE LINE OF GENIUS.
Many unconsciously smother this truth under debris of
indecision, but they have only to search and find
it,
to
make
a
success.
The finer the precepts one invites into one's being, the
greater possibilities one reaches to bring out SOUL-EX
PRESSION! Thus
it
is
plain to see that man's work
on earth
is
the result of
a
BURSTING OUT OF THE
EMBRYO OF HIS ABILITY, which has no Limit as to
Capability, although man may think so.
To know the truth of what one
is
capable to do one
must study the soul's calling, and then carry out its pos
sibilities to the utmost through Energy and Mind-direc
tion. One may not seem to accomplish much in one life,
but one must remember, that one's LIFE-STORY IS
NOT CONTAINED IN ONE CHAPTER! It started
with the FIRST CELL OF ALL CREATION AS ITS
ORIGINAL CHAPTER!

life, and in each NEW LIFE or REINCARNATION, he
is Molded to bring the Higher Lights of his Originality
into being; thus he is writing Chapter after Chapter of
his BOOK OF LIFE TO SHOW TO GOD, AND TO BE
READ IN ETERNITY!
His chapter may include "sketches of dreams" which
he cannot interpret until he reaches the DIVINE
SHORES ONCE MORE; for their ORIGIN may be
such that he cannot Visualize them in the PHYSICAL
STATE, and he must wait until his Vision is clarified in
Eternity and he can look back over his past blunderings.
Then he is receptive to the finer Truths and Triumphs of
life's quest and can later put them into Realities.
This is the law under which the SOUL Evolves in its
Transcendental state —advancing to the Higher Realms
of the Unfoldment of Wisdom in each ensuing chapter.
Believe not, beloved, that you are through when you
have lived your little life on earth! ALL HUMANITY
ARE OLD SOULS, AND CONTINUE ON INTO UN

Within each chapter of life there is an Opportunity to
fill the TREASURE BOX OF THE SOUL with Beau
tiful Impressions and the Upholding of Standards; and
each short experience of a physical life writes its own
record for heaven and earth to behold. It paints the
Permanency or Impermanency of its Spirit on the world's
canvas.
If man reads this carefully he will observe that he must
hold tight to what is UPLIFTING, GOOD AND HOLY,
for these are his FUTURE REFERENCES, and the IN

realize how important it is to cultivate and fertilize the

possibilities of good works. Man may hide a shameful
record from the earthly world for a short duration of
time; he may not be called to account while in the physi
cal state at all—but at his Transition to the OTHER
SHORE HE TAKES EVERYTHING WITH HIM, and
his conscience has it all written out for God and man to
read. Then, too, his record on earth has been transmit
ted to his children and to his associates —and lingers there
—MULTIPLYING ITS EVILS!
ON HIGH, his memories of physical wrongs done on
earth are burned from his spirit by the fires of conscience,
and he is cleansed before being again sent to earth in
another Reincarnation; and his SPIRIT, thus divided
into two parts, enters into its NEW CYCLE AFRESH
to make another attempt to fulfil its allotted pattern.
THE OTHER HALF STILL HOLDS ON TO ITS PER
SONALITY IN GOD'S REALM!
Sins are derived from imitation; one physical being
teaches them to another; but the physical sins are left
behind to decay with the broken body as useless utilities
of life, only the memories and imprints of them being
carried on to eternity! If these memories PERSIST IN
ETERNITY, and are not Consumed in the fires of con
science, they are again Reproduced in another life on
earth.
This is a difficult problem! A violet is always a violet,
and in nature's natural trend a Physical Pattern cannot
be changed unless some Spiritual Will-power is demon
strated! Otherwise one PATTERN OF NATURE
WOULD COPY ITSELF! So all may see how difficult
it is for man to OBEY HIS SOUL, which clamors for a
Manifestation of a "set line of wisdom."

GARDLESS OF THEIR NEEDS— REGARDLESS OF

He who defines all these tenets according to his earthly

a LOVE-OFFERING TO THE WORLD.
Well do I remember the countless hours I spent in St.
Peter's at Rome, thinking naught of commercial praises —
Heaven forbid ! Every stroke of the brush was given in
praise of Deity, and to make His Beauty permanent for
mankind and to weave it into their brains through the
magic of brush long ages after Raphael had passed from
vision.
I think I love most the tapestries in St. Peter's in which
I wove my very soul, there to live forever. I think it
was in the reign of Leo that my greatest work was ac

the hands of flesh and blood, and HOLDING THE

Do you know, dearly beloved, that one must go into
THE SILENCE to be able to perfect the best in one's

originality. But they may struggle a lifetime to put
what they DREAM UPON CANVAS, and only realize
useless struggle! Why? Because they endeavored to do
so only through shallow, physical issues. The man of
flesh and blood only was painting and depicting the story,
THE SPIRITUAL MAN WAS NOT CONSULTED!
These two Companionate forces must work together for
ultimate success! And if man depends entirely upon the
physical issue, he fails to REACH THE REAL SELF, or
INVISIBLE POWER which produces the Refinement of
his work. And this gives a definite answer as to why some
artists have MIRRORED THEIR SOULS IN THEIR
CANVASES, which live for aye, and others have painted
only the SURFACE without DEPTH. The first have

OF ETERNITY!
Thus man in any one life, by applying this higher
method, may win his heights of fame, and it depends en

Decision of Character, and not to listen to this beautiful
voice within one's bosom, IS THE UNPARDONABLE
SIN!
These words often are questioned throughout your
world: What is the UNPARDONABLE SIN spoken of in
the Holy Writ? Jesus endeavored to convey their Mean
ing, THAT THE SPIRIT OF GOD LIVES WITHIN
MANKIND just as much as OUTWARDLY, AND
SPEAKS TO HIM IN GUIDANCE!
And that he, who disobeyed this SILENT VOICE
speaking to him with its greater wisdom, was committing
the "Unpardonable sin." He who continuously obeys
the moods of his body and lives in a pandering to the

place for that picture in the Gallery of GOD'S PARA
DISE, and he must needs become a student of the Great
Master—and make another pilgrimage back to earth.
Thus he is returned to earth to "follow out his pattern,"
and to try—try again—until his work is finally accom
plished. This ILLUSTRATES the LAW OF REIN
CARNATION! But once that one's ideals and pattern
are completed after the Transition from EARTH TO
ETERNITY, one may truthfully say "Life is finished."
One does not again have to suffer the mists and perplexi
ties of another carnal life, and become aweary of being a
slave to flesh and blood.
One has at last become acquainted with one's INNER
SELF through having Recognized and Obeyed the COM
MANDS of one's SOUL and its Promptings. The evi
dence of this power has been proved through the Manifes
tation and Creation of LASTING BEAUTY, which one
may now leave to the world, and LAY UPON THE
ALTAR OF DEITY, IN ETERNITY!
Ah ! What passionate Torment or Paeans of joy man
experiences as he reads over his BOOK OF LIFE upon
reaching Eternity! Some books contain stories of endless
mercenary carnality and gross relations —others are short
and sanctified. Others again are long, full and rich,
every detail a thrilling story.
And thus it is that many individuals do not have so
many lives to endure; and again others, who have not
written SPIRITUAL HISTORY OF GOOD into their
lives, must again mirror their Souls—in an Endeavor for
Success— through another CYCLE OF LIFE, and if this
does not again need a repetition in flesh and blood— they
may go on with enhanced force in the ethereal realms.

endeavor, and needs no longer to pay for sins committed
through the misery of physical concepts, he becomes a

Such individuals as the great masters of philosophy
live and move in eternal peace, and are MESSIAHS OF

works. Their absorption of beautiful truths through
countless lives have accomplished their work on earth.

My parents passed out of my life in my tender youth,
for heaven needed their art to reflect back to earth : thus
in my youth I was given over to the tender care of this
good monk. He understood the artistic side of Raphael
which my parents had also recognized in my growing
youth.
He it was who gave me every opportunity to go forth
and DO MY BEST; and placed my life in its artistic
orbit. I smile as oft I think how I was reprimanded for
not attending mass, and how Bartholomeo would say—
sagely—"All good work is Practicing Religion." He
knew my soul's quest was to place MY RELIGION upon
walls. And did this not mean a great deal more than

But call no man "Father" to represent Deity. Man

Out of all "forms of religions" some GOOD must fall

of simple people who worked for their daily bread, living
in peace, quietude and contentment, with a few friends of
the commonwealth of their own class.
Father was a miller, and thus my boyhood hours were
spent working with father. My pastime was drawing
pictures upon the walls of the old mill. My brothers and
sisters were all industrious, excepting myself. Father
took pride in their Ambition, but hung his head when
he looked at me, a fat, overgrown boy, who took no pleas
ure in anything apparently —except to draw pictures.
Oft he chided mother for not chastising me, and forc
ing me to work at such things as did the rest of the fam
ily. But mother had more understanding than he. She
would say, "If the boy wants to draw pictures, let him
draw pictures in peace."
Father said, "Well, if he is going to do that we might
as well send him to school and let him make it a business
and not a pastime." So first I was sent to a school of
miscellaneous learning. The only success I made was
at drawing a picture of the teacher which thoroughly
incensed him.
He sent for father, and said, "See what sin your son
has done." Father answered quietly, with one eye closed
and one eye open as he sat and gazed upon the picture,
"Well, it does look like you."
The master was so angry that he ordered father to
take me home, never to return; and it was thus that my
parents decided that I should study the art of portrait

and allowing me to use her for a model. I fancy I painted

He who spends his time in SPIRITUAL INSPIRA
TION in order to contact with DIVINITY in the en
deavor to which he is aspiring to succeed, lives an entirely
different life from him who mingles with the workaday
world; and he is often seriously misunderstood.
And this is because the God-spark, the Inner-man
present in his body, does not connect with PHYSICAL
RELATIONSHIPS. To be a success in any chosen voca
tion, one must FULLY REALIZE THE TRUTH OF
THIS STATEMENT: THAT GENIUS ARISES FROM
CULTIVATED SPIRITUAL RELATIONSHIPS CON
TACTING WITH LIFE! If one touches on any part
of the commercial order of principles, one must needs
drift away from God; and to be an artistic success, one
must always be Conscious of the SUPERIOR FORCE
OF GOD-VIBRATION, that which brings Beauty
through the "spiritual eyes"—instead of through the
physical eyes of one's temporal being.
Religion is based entirely upon the same principle.
One receives PAR VALUE FROM DIVINITY, if one
can become unconscious of one's physical, commercial
surroundings. There is a finer, supernormal reaction
from the Spiritual Source of Contemplation, and to this
fact your world may give credit for all the higher arts
and scientific accomplishments of the earth's progres-
sional growth.

COLOR AS COLOR, ONLY! But with the Conscious
ness of the SPIRITUAL—ALL SEEING EYES OF THE
SOUL—working through the artist—he sees "countless
vibrations," which your own spirit eventually shall be

of art in which man contends.
If one makes a study of one special color, one may Dis
cover therein a UNIVERSE OF MATERIAL FOR
TRANSFORMATION! This detailed relationship is
not visualized through physical eyes, for the physical eyes
are only akin to a fast moving camera; they catch all the
detail, and imprint that detail upon a lens and film,
WHICH HOWEVER MUST BE DEVELOPED!
Thus what the physical eyes visualize bears all detail,
BUT THIS MUST BE DEVELOPED IN THE SOUL-

An ARTIST is not born overnight! His knowledge is
the detailed experience of many past reincarnations ! The
higher his precepts and his interest in certain lines during
these various cycles of life, the greater genius will spring
out at some given period.
It is well to develop in one's life, that which nature
most cries out for—whether or not there seems hope for
its success. It is one step further along the road of
developing Genius, which on his returning again to earth
in the cycle of life, SHALL BEAR THE IMPRINT of

and come into prominence—perhaps in a certain life of
greater height.
All Genius is thus gradually built up from contact with
varied experiences and relations to its supernatural
growth. Until an individual's originality is brought to
its highest pinnacle, he returns again to earth to complete
his work of promise.
It is said that the old masters were gifted with an in
sight into the Art of Light and Shadow, that the masters
of to-day have not discovered. Perhaps I can help to
inspire the artist of this age, by telling him, that he is
working only through his physical soul—and from out
ward imaginings— INSTEAD OF LOOKING INTO HIS
SPIRITUAL SOUL FOR HIS MATERIALS!
The artist reaches the height of triumphant success
when he can find a subject in which LOVE can be ex
pressed upon a canvas. It is not from gazing at a sub
ject to catch their every-day expression. Success is the
result of one's INWARD EMOTION, AND SPIRIT
UAL DESCRIPTION of that subject.
One never finds a finish to a subject by superficially
looking at a model, there expecting to find his material.
THE SOUL IS THE SOLE TREASURE BOX OF
GENIUS, wherein the Spiritual Details are Implanted,
and where one finds the Treasure.
Mother, and Saskia, were my inspirations! Yet by
only looking at them, I could never have given their ex
pressions the saintly touch. I saw them in another

and all her jewels and finery handled by vandal hands be
cause of my financial reverses after her passing over.
When a man is living in a spiritual world of love and
of earthly success, he is apt to neglect the finer points
of his finances, and become too certain of his material
surroundings, leaving a loophole, by means of which he
loses all.
My loophole was extravagance. Having through my
art received great returns from my paintings, I felt that
this would always last as long as I did. But Saskia's
passing—in the crowning glory of my success —was the
cause of my financial downfall!
It is best not to dwell on serious subjects, for WE, as
intelligent Spirit Forces, have no regrets over what is
past. We merely look upon FAILURES AS STEPPING
STONES TO SUCCESSES! They are but memories;
and perhaps Stepping Stones to help a living world to
realize, what I should have realized! —that when calam
ity befalls one—IT IS A HINT FROM NATURE to
CLIMB THESE STEPPING STONES OF EXPERI
ENCE—and endeavor to meet the departed one through
SPHERES OF HIGHER CONSCIOUSNESS, instead of
—as most human personalities in the temporal sphere in
their own aspiring selfish whims —throwing up their
hands and quitting in the height of the most critical mo
ment.
This is the Psychological Moment, when they should
realize, that they really do not belong to ANY ONE BUT
GOD ; and thus they should aspire all the more to CON
TINUE IN HIS WORK AND REACH HIS HEIGHTS
OF UPBUILDING AND PROMISE!

Scarcely any one knew what had become of Rembrandt,
for I had changed my name. Only my pictures hung in
the art galleries as a memory of the brilliant heights of
my success.
This higher life has been a great revelation to me; and
I wish to thank the world of art-lovers for upholding the
genius of Rembrandt in spite of all detracting events.
Had not the art lovers of a later date acknowledged
this fact, the inspiration which my pictures call forth in
the souls of the new world of art and artists, might not
have been in evidence at this time.
It was said that Rembrandt could paint a wrinkle on
his mother's face that looked as if the flesh were really
there; and many endeavors have been made to imitate
this art.
I may be able to help the aspirant a trifle by telling
him, that he must UNCONSCIOUSLY ENTER THE

vestigation; and a beholder often believed himself to be
mistaken —to be stricken with an optical delusion.
Now it is true that all these hidden objects are an estab
lished fact, and can be discovered in my portraits.
THEY WERE SPIRITUAL VISIONS BACK OF
THE STRUCTURAL BACKGROUND! which the
faintest —almost invisible —touch of the brush brought
into prominence. Only through cultivating the art of
how to study a portrait, can these hidden objects be
visualized. They are ONLY A PART OF THE LIGHT
AND SHADOW, which being gazed at at a certain angle,
bring into prominence an object not heretofore discovered.
This is a lost art in the present regime of artistic sense,
because man looks only to the WORLDLY FIELD OF
THOUGHT for his materials, and has not received his
viewpoint from the waiting instructor within his soul.
One needs to gaze at a subject earnestly, and then draw
its Vibrations into one's Soul! for that God-wisdom —or
higher skill—EMANATES FROM THE SOUL AND
THROUGH THE FINGER TIPS; not through the phys

All superior, or psychic-force, is a reaction through the

Attuned to the Infinite, THE MORE BEAUTIFUL
WILL BE THE SHADES HE VISUALIZES.
No two individuals see these colorings exactly alike,
not even in a flower nor in any object of nature. They
may describe them as yellow, or red, which is but a base
material answer.
Every flower and every color has an AURA OF IN
FINITE SHADING extending out from the subject it

unconsciously envision this aura of colorings; AND
THERE THEY GET THEIR IDEAS.
Now this same condition develops into indescribably
beautiful colorings, and into an entirely different relation
ship, than the earthly sphere indicates, WHEN ONE
ENTERS INTO THE ETHEREAL FORM OF LIFE!
OUR COLORS ARE SEEN AS LIGHT AND NOT AT
ALL AS MATERIAL COLORS!
The physical eyes do not visualize the air which they
breathe, yet humanity know it is the sustenance of their
lives. The air which mortality breathes HAS ALL THE
COLORS OF THE RAINBOW, and other colors be
sides, Vibrating out from these standard colors. Yet the
physical man just calls this "marvelous glory —air," and
uses it ingloriously for his daily breath with little thought
of appreciation or gratitude.
And the "air" itself has a beautiful aura! Each in
visible cell of oxygen and hydrogen CONTAINS A UNI
VERSE OF INTELLIGENCE AND COLORS, so in-
defatigably "refined," that only the spirit forces see its
glory.
You as physical beings have not developed mentality
sufficiently to KNOW THE TRUTHS of this Refinement
of your surroundings. And it is the "spiritual soul-de
velopment in the body" that Produces the colors which
the artist sees in the "ethereal surroundings" of your
solids, on which material eyes simply fall.
New colors are being originated every day according
to man's thinking, however these are not the outcome of
man's material thinking! They are what his soul en
visioned when it went out of his physical body or frame
work, seeking its own sphere of beauty.
You shall be greatly enthralled when the time comes
that your spirit leaves its material body for eternity, for
it shall discover deeper beauty than was ever realized be
fore in its physical state.

234 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
It is man's slow approach to this "psychic sense of
visualization," that results in his commonplace judgment
of colors. In Eternity, the Vibrations are thousands of
times faster than they are in physical realization.
The faster the Vibrations are the more highly developed
are the surrounding colors—thus we have shades of pinks
and lavenders of which no material mind could conceive
the beauty.
Ethereal colorings are not at all as man may try to
imagine them to be, as being pale in shades. Only three
colors are barred out from eternity's beauty, and they
are black, brown and gray. These are only somber colors
of earth. All other colors are of higher vibrations! In
their velocity of speed they naturally bring out newer
lights and deeper colorings. The higher the color, the
greater their Vibrations.
I believe it has been mentioned to you before that colors
have much bearing upon human nature. When one gets
away from the relationship of one's individual colors,
one is out of tune with all harmonies. Each individual
has an aura of spiritual coloring vibrating from his soul,
and when once a person discovers the true color of his
AURA, and lives within the bounds of this harmonious
color, his life in the temporal sense is vastly more peace
ful, contented and harmonious.
In the choosing of colors in one's surroundings there
should be great scientific study. Mankind could de
velop a much higher spiritual sensibility if they adhered
to the colors of their own AURA. This fact can be dis
covered only through LISTENING TO THEIR INTUI
TIONS as to the color most pleasing to their natures.
When humanity learn to associate their lives with their
"rightful colorings," they shall be held in their vibrations,
which naturally draw unto themselves the field of eter
nity that holds the same vibrations of colors; just as a

musical instrument responds to the touch in accord with
it.
Otherwise, if a man is out of tune with the infinite, he is
out of harmony with himself as regards the law of color
of his AURA. This may seem a strange statement, but it
is a well proved fact, and it is as essential to humanity to
know this fact, as it is to know how to meet the other
daily problems of their lives.
Now I thank you and will reply to the questions I read
in your mind.
We have houses just as real to us as your own; infi
nitely more beautiful than anything on earth. We need
pictures for our walls. Do not imagine that they are on
canvas or wood and painted in oils. Our work is all con
structed through mental—not through physical ability.
We have anything we wish to make our surroundings
phantoms of beauty. We use our genius for ourselves—
also to assist that on earth. All detailed touches of great
beauty upon earth are completed from eternity.
We carry out our own desired themes and accelerate
the works of others. The field of art in eternity is vastly
more interesting than it ever was in a material sense.
There is a meeting place for artists in "Venus," the do
main of art and music—for color vibrations even emanate
from music! There we convene together and discuss the
details of our interests and our work.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 237
I may say that the thorny path over which most indi
viduals travel in life, I have now found to be BENE
FICIAL to their spiritual growth ! I have learned that
one could not realize the beauty of God's graces when
they come within his grasp, if one had not ENCOUN
TERED DIFFICULTIES and Perplexities by way of
contrast.
In looking backward over my strange career, I have
not many vital regrets: for, after all, GENIUS, and LOVE
are not brought to the surface—to figure largely in the
life of the individual—without PHYSICAL STRUGGLE
through which one finds the pathway to all that is GOOD.
To me the THEME OF LIFE IS LOVE AND
GENIUS! Both are really one in relationship to man's
higher Development. He who travels through life with
out having experienced the spark of GENIUS AND
LOVE, has no genius in truth, but is born in the physical
state of being through which he must travel many times
in order to over come it and enable him to grow spirit
ually.
Those who were teachers of logic in the older days
believed seriously in the physical potency of concept, but
in this day and time the ALMIGHTY FORCE AND
POWER OF MIND VIBRATION, or GOD, is recog
nized amongst mankind as the MENTAL WORLD OF
ALL CREATIONS; and thus the temperamental moods
of men are more easily understood.
It is recorded in many of Beethoven's biographies that
he seemed to be cursed with a streak of insanity, but this
is not true. The temperamental fits were but giving vent
to repressed spiritual emotions: for, remember, Bee
thoven, in his later years LIVED ALONE IN SILENCE,
for all sounds of earth were shut out of his hearing.
Music alone was his entire world and thus could not be
destroyed by earthly inharmonies.

God; but that which is PHYSICAL, also, through the
breaking of natural laws—oft deteriorates early in life.
This question of deafness was in my time indeed a
curse on the face of God's beautiful earth, for there were
no learned men, who scientifically studied so intensely as
now—causes and effects to keep the physical frame in
healthy condition. If a man lost his hearing, or his sight
became affected, it was usually taken for granted, and
naturally nothing done about it.
But there was a splendid blessing in my becoming
deaf, for mechanical sounds were deadened, and only
the SPIRITUAL ones ran rampant —but such was not
then understood. I was often seen beating time to the
SPIRITUAL MUSIC surging through my mind, and
this was thought queer.
Perhaps, had I not had this affliction, I could not have
heard the harmonies and symphonies of these heaven-sent
vibrations, and thus it was that many of my later compo
sitions were finer productions on account of this defi
ciency of the physical senses.
I remember well the "MOONLIGHT SONATA." It
was written after a long, lonely walk in a FIT OF
ECSTASY. It was a spiritual message which came
through my inner soul during a long moonlight stroll,
started in loneliness and despair at being completely shut
out from the world of physical vibrations.
There was a dance of spirit forces before my eyes,
pulsating before me; and upon returning home, I merely
produced their song as I heard it. I could see them in
their beautiful motions. Many of them bore familiar
faces and they seemed to stream out of the moonlight
and carry me onward into space and happiness until I
became a part of their joy and revelry and musical pas
sion.

DUCED IT. Thus ofttimes a deformity of the body
draws one closer to God, and His helpers, and this is the
"real source of production!" No one should grieve if a
physical deformity should come upon him, for it may be
God's PURPOSE to free his soul and mind from physical
thraldom so that spiritual art may be catered to.
For in this higher realm all Beauty and Good are im
planted and developed, to be given forth to the world as
exquisite beauty and art.
Perhaps there is little in the lifetime of Beethoven to
add to what has already been written, except that he arose
like a thrush from a cuckoo nest. But I can especially
bring cheer and hope to mortals who, through ignorance
and mental laziness, are dragged down and deprived of
bringing out the best in their possibilities.
The true secret of success, when one is forced to live
continuously in company WITH THE NEGATIVE
FORCES, is to have a hobby, and dwell entirely with
that hobby. It may be your lord and master and savior.
Grandfather! after whom I was named, was wholly
responsible for the Beethoven which the world knows.
He it was who desired to live his life over again through
me. Having my father as a son who failed him, he felt
determined to make of me a bright and shining star in the
firmament of life. Had he not thus held my hand through
life I might have perished from despair.
I was but four years of age when he passed away, but
his passing from earth made no difference in his plans, for
it was he who continued, from his heavenly home, to
direct the Genius of my life. It is a consolation to me,
dear readers, to know that one's endeavors of any kind
ARE NEVER LOST to God's view.
One continues to aspire with visible or invisible effort,
for MIND IS THE TOTAL POWER OF THE COS
MOS, and the same force that Created ALL GOOD.

Thus when mind forms one creative pattern, it carries
out its purpose and enlarges upon that purpose FOR
EVER, in a direct line, or cycle.
MUSIC IS BUT THE SPIRITUAL VIBRATION OF
THE COSMOS RADIOING THROUGH THE SOUL;
and is related to the Eternal Atmosphere as any sounds of
nature which your physical ear may be attuned to. The
favorite instruments used for its construction are the vio
lin and the organ, both of which I mastered while in life's
temporal form; thus my life "over here" has been quite
interesting.
Music is forever being composed by us, and new airs
brought to light, before they are inspired or transmitted
to earth through the mind of some genius; or upon some
other sphere of mental growth. All musical composition
originates in the minds of those who are "over here," and
we bring it back to humanity. Our inspirational power
seems to be part of our ethereal makeup, merely coming
to us through our spiritual intuition, new sounds of vibra
tions are ever developing upon our spiritual minds; thus
it is that your music is expanding.
Music is the youngest art in your world; one may say
less than five hundred years old. The origination of
musical composition really comes from priests formulat
ing tones into queer chants, which were harmoniously
magnified into chords and chorus work.
Singing originated before instruments were made to
accompany vocal tones; and thus written harmony is
young, and we, "over here," feel, that we have much work
assigned us for the future interest of the worlds. The
musical work of this day shall seem very crude to that
of the musical genius who shall come forth in the coming
century upon your earth.
All this improvement shall be due to the Growth of

lovers, who will, as the years pass, more fully understand
the SPIRITUAL VIBRATIONS— RHYTHM and HAR
MONY of EACH NOTE.
MUSIC HAS COLOR VIBRATION, and there is a

heard, but little is known of the scientific analysis of that
sound or note. Thus music shall be more scientifically
studied along higher spiritual lines, introducing to earth
higher unknown vibrations more resembling the "Tran

mind at present has a limited understanding of; and
when the PSYCHIC MIND of man has come into its
own, he will understand the "law of vibration" in its
higher and more musical power. Its tones shall be heard
direct without the aid of the Intermediates.
These musical tones are forever mingling in vibratory
sound about humanity, but the physical ear is not suffi
ciently developed —Spiritually—to hear them. As one
learns to appreciate the "spiritual relationships of life," a
higher understanding is gained of music; and this is to
know, that the law is but natural, and a part of one's
rightful being. It is just as the air which God gives man
to breathe, which is likewise Invisible to the eye and the
mind.
Even the human voice is evoluting, very slowly to be
sure, because of man's mercenary un-Godlike strides and
physical clingings in the daily workaday world. There
is no coarseness of tones in the eternal world, and if
humanity wished to have the beauty of eternity reflected
back to them and receive better sounds along the path
way of life, they must cultivate the art of a musical voice
even in speaking.
It seemed strange to me when I came "over here" not
to hear the coarse repulsive raspings of the human voices:

for the voices of the spirit entities are of soft musical
tones, and all seem to reflect Love and Respect, Harmony
and Purity of Thought. Thus the Spiritual nature of man
has much to do with his success in life whatever trend
his nature aspires for.
One may BELIEVE, that the physical conditions about
one HAVE NO CONNECTION with the Spiritual Force
of his individual life, but to believe this, and that the
Spiritual World has no share in his progress is a sad mis
take! and may prevent many a brilliant genius from suc
ceeding at his best. It is a sad disappointment to the
soul, when one comes "over here" and discovers, that just
because he did not follow the laws of nature, and allowed
certain earthly conditions to hamper him in his best rela
tionships and expression of the life work which he loved
best, he feels and suffers a lasting regret.
Man must early learn, THAT THE SPIRIT IS NOT
SUBJECT TO PHYSICAL DETRACTION! and the
sooner this fact is learned; the sooner the individual may
accomplish his special part and theme in his temporal life.
ALL SPIRIT IN TRUTH IS AKIN, AND A PART
OF GOD'S NATURAL UNIVERSAL REALM AND
HIS DIVINITY! One should not cling to the inhar
monious detracting desires of others, even though they
be blood relations, for they but hamper all spiritual suc
cess.
If a brother places stumbling blocks in your path, it is
no intelligent reason why you should, because he is your
brother, allow him to deter you in your own Spiritual
Purpose in Life.
So often in life, negative conditions have prevailed
over the good, simply because a person conscientiously
believed that PHYSICAL TIES should Govern the SPIR
ITUAL. This is all wrong! It may be true in the phys
ical sense, but not according to the higher cosmic law of
Vibrative Spiritual Force, which is all one finds TO BE

PRACTICABLE, when one arrives in the Spiritual Ex
istence bereft of one's physical parts.
We find, that through earthly affection, one oft mis
directs his earthly barque, contrary to what God intended
for him, according to His superior plan, which was to be
the true direction of one's creative spirit while in the tem
poral form, and his designated mission for living.
It has often been proclaimed that all people cannot be
successful. This is but a manmade ideal containing NO
VITAL TRUTH: for God in His structural and progres
sive plan of evolution NEVER ADMITS NOR MAKES
A FAILURE IN ANY SENSE. Failure is an entering of
the Negative Forces, which are encouraged and allowed
to thrive.
So why should man, a working Helper OF GOD IN
VITE THIS IDEA OF FAILURE? No matter what
the conditions arising about one, man is gifted from birth
WITH A TRUE CREATIVE SPIRIT OR SPARK OF
THAT VIBRATION OF WHICH GOD HIMSELF IS
COMPOSED: OUT OF WHICH MAN MAY BUILD
ANY KIND OF A WORLD FOR HIMSELF, FOR

I wish to give this word to the musical student: to
CULTIVATE THE SPIRITUAL FORCE within him
in rendering compositions —and listen, and hearken to his
SPIRITUAL SELF. To us it is appalling how few tones
are rendered after the human frees himself from his
heavenly state of mind, or inspirational moments.
The students however are not to blame for this con
dition, for they are all MECHANICALLY TAUGHT,
knowing nothing of the SOURCE of all glory; and the
teachers themselves not Comprehending the Truth of the
"worth of spiritual direction," nor how to "Analyze the
single note"; and thus the greater value of one's musical
rendering is practically void.

into words for you. It is only the SPIRITUAL SELF
that can compass it. But I may say that holding to the
sound of the one note as it blends with others, is the key.
Usually the single note is taken for granted, just as one
might consider a pencil as merely a pencil, and loses the
depth of its possible VALUE and the characteristics of
its construction and that it may be instrumental in re
cording a time-lasting symphony.
Once a sound is born IT NEVER DIES, but goes on
and on into space, for sound is not destructible! Thus
the human ear too quickly loses the Lingering Sound to
place upon it its par value. So one must dwell more
upon its harmony, and lose sight of coarse tones: change
the sounds of crudeness, and absorb that which comes
from the musical beat and get its meaning.
To become a musical genius, one must have this art
instilled into his being in his Formative Period, and have
him cultivate it both mechanically and spiritually, thus
understanding Harmony in its perfect sense.
There is much need of SOUL TRAINING in your
world. The mechanical body only is being trained to
its utmost strength and capacity. Soul training is not
attained alone through religious direction, but has its be
ginning in the training of the SPIRITUAL FORCE OF
THE SELF, OR INNER MAN, or Listening to the Con
science.
The Human is trained by listening and heeding that
which comes from within him OF GOOD, from his all-
wise Spiritual Body, instead of to Mechanical Outside
Direction. I see the time not many decades hence, when
mind development shall be Understood to be entirely of
Soul Direction. But in this day little stress or gratitude
is given this mighty soul.

and bringing into the temporal life all that might represent
Deity in highest formation. Not until man is willing to
pay the price by unselfishness and the sacrifice of the
coarsening Physical Relationships, and turn to the Spir
itual Body for Direction, will the true worth of the Soul-
consciousness be Realized and Enlarged upon to its True
Effectiveness !
OVER HERE ALL IS MIND! Why does the tem
poral body so cling to the ideals of physical growth to
NEGLECT THE GOD-LIGHT WITHIN?
Richard Wagner, Chopin, Mozart, Liszt, and so many
others— great artists—and myself ARE YOUR WORLD
INSPIRERS in music! It is our only mission to grow
into man's consciousness, and Enlarge his Spirit by our
Work of Inspiration, to renew the Reflection of our minds
through artists of earth.
All together we give concerts "over here," which some
day you shall have the privilege of hearing. Venus is our
musical world; a world of spirit homes, out of which all
musical talent reflects back to inspire mankind.
All musical tones vibrate to a certain strength power:
each note vibrating a color, for all Vibration is Color.
Understand this well, that this is true according to the
velocity in which it travels. The faster the note, the
higher and deeper the color.
The lowest color is seemingly the reddish pink; the
highest the violet shadow, representing the colors of the
rainbow in between, this is as near as I can describe it to
your minds. The colors of the rainbow are the true
order of the vibratory colors of nature, and all these
colors Blend one into the Other in Music, according to
the Velocity in which they travel in their regular form.

inspiring him to WRITE THE THEME SONG for the

246 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
Now I am pleased to thank you for your time and
interest.
LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.
Henry Ward Beecher: RICHARD WAGNER IS
HERE. Spiritual minds are as thick about one's person
as the air which you breathe.
RICHARD WILHELM WAGNER
1813-1883
The Man Behind the Music
I greet you, dear mediums, and feel really flattered to
be here. In my lifetime I was rarely understood, but
great is the power of Deity in the Perpetuity of Mind,
where free thinking is not restrained. And SINCERITY
in one's Work creates one's Spiritual Monument on earth,
living ever after him.
To me music was the entire call of my nature : in other
words "nature's language to me." In my reveries of
meditation, I took from out of the natural elements of
earth the harmonic vibrations as I read them in my in
dividual way, and set them to music.
The clear call, or song of the bird. The "whirr" of the
wind. The blast of the storm. The gentle rippling of
the brook. The waterfall, and so many other themes.
What mattered it if nature did not speak in academic
harmonics. Music is a nature in itself! little understood
indeed by the masses, because the human ear has not the
time in a busy workaday world, to accurately translate
its vibratory forces into sounds that befit the very nature
of God's harmony.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 247
However, one can scarcely expect MUSIC to Occupy
the fundamental position in the material world it is en
titled to, where the physical issues of life so abound, that
they smother its fine vibrations under the perplexities of
human struggle for existence.
In looking back over my temporal life-stream, I would
not wish to change it in many respects. The storms of
life which one encounters but enrich the Experience of the
soul, through which one arrives at a Deeper Analysis of
the Cosmos.
He who has no worries nor aspirations to keep him
ever awake to LIFE'S PURPOSE, has little hope toward
knowing that his own PERSONALITY IS IN UNITY
WITH THE ALMIGHTY UNIVERSAL LOVE AND
GOD ! He who is in some ways protected and never en
counters life's storms, has no deep appreciation of the
stirring Emotions, Hopes, and Dreams for better things
to come.
Thus I say that Realized Dreams are but the Realiza
tions of Imagination. And it must be a consolation to
the reader to know, that if a dream or a hope IS NOT
FULFILLED IN EARTHLY LIFE, it is like the rain
bow with the pot of gold at its base: for man Realizes
his Dreams in the fields of Eternity through the develop
ment of his own SPIRITUAL NATURE.
Music
is,
to the world, as near an approach to Deity as
one may realize in any principle, yet how few individuals
create in their daily life a deep and genuine comprehen
sion and love for music.
Nevertheless, had Richard Wagner come forth with
"LOHENGRIN" in this present day, he might not have
had to wait thirteen years to hear his own composition

heaven. This is no fault of the denizens of the spirit
world, and their inspirational work, but it is the fault of
the material mankind, which is forever reaching out for
SOMETHING NEW and lacks the keen Appreciation of
INDIVIDUAL BEAUTY, which is within their grasp:
always believing, that there is something better beyond
their ken.
The discontentment of human nature has forced prog
ress to the extent one now realizes conditions on your
earth to be in. In a way this is for GOOD: yet much
GOOD is forced out of life in the hurly burly and mad
rush of mind in its thinking processes.
Were I amongst you again, I would preach the Im
portance of STUDYING THE VIBRATORY SOUNDS
OF MUSIC IN THE AIR, even though one is not spe
cially trained in music. The human ear, itself, is capable
of picking up—or I may say, absorbing countless vibra
tions of sound; but this gift is sorely neglected.
To hear a composition through as a whole is not to
hear it ! But to hear a composition note by note as ONE
NOTE BLENDS TO THE OTHER IS TO HEAR
MUSIC. In this way one EVEN KNOWS GOD IN
THE FULNESS OF HIS BEAUTY.
This reminds me to say, that the same situation exists
in the minds of men —in their varied ideas of God —or
seeing God IN A CERTAIN PATTERN—and believing
in that pattern only! instead of assembling all the ele
ments of nature FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE
CREATIVE SEED OF LIFE, and putting them into one
Composition as a whole—COMPOSED OF HARMO
NIOUS UNITS!
However, God is too readily taken to pieces by the
Ignorant, as they would pluck a goose. And this same
illustration is true in regard to the critic's conception of
the VIBRATORY FORCE OF HARMONY IN MUSIC.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 249
People assume a strong like or dislike, according with
their shallow Material Senses, regarding a special trend
of music. They close out all other relationships of
thought regarding it from their minds, as though it were
debasing to their souls.
But there is a high class of education in studying and
listening to any class of music, from the lowest primary
beginning, up into the most unfathomable and mysterious
airs.
Have either of you (the mediums) heard my com
position, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN"? It befits this
fast age in which man now aspires for his goal, and is at
last UNDERSTOOD IN ITS SPIRITUAL SENSE.
Like any other issue in nature, music has grown from
the simplest sound to harmony and to a flourishing tree
of life. Yet, strange to say, the bud has not yet burst
out into a flower to the fulness of its beauty. Just as
God, or NATURE, evolute, so does music also!
The composer of this day and age believes, that music
has developed to its highest concept—but this is not true!
The old masters are Again Born to Earth to Revolu
tionize its music! It is only as God sent Christ to earth
to Evolute His God-thought into mankind.
While I have this thought in mind, I have authority
from Dr. Beecher to give out this secret: that a NEW
MESSIAH is now growing up in your America, and,
through his Philosophy, shall establish a new WORLD
GOVERNMENT which shall SPIRITUALIZE the world
anew. This is coming to pass; and he shall expound the
New Jerusalem, or New Universal Thought as SPIRIT
UALITY!

things, EVOLUTE and take on new Development —giv

nor would have wished to understand.
Richard Wagner was reborn to be a musical genius,
and was far too advanced for his time. It is needless to
say now, that in his lifetime it was unjust to condemn
him for knowing too much about a part of the World's
issues.
To me the world was like a Great Personality. The
social regime seemed all wrong; even to-day it needs
much reform. There is never any harm in Telling the
Truth, for God DEALS IN TRUTHS and Loves the
frank and just minded!
I still hold great reverence for my own country —Ger
many—and know her to be greatly misunderstood. Hav
ing been for many years monopolized by military rule,
the common people have had no voice in her Manage
ment—as a consequence —the war; but this shall not
again take place, for it was the BEGINNING OF A
NEW BIRTH FOR GERMANY!
There is still a great class existing of the old military
party; yet the newer educational system shall preside in
the affairs of the country. And I see wonderful new in
ventions coming from my father country which the world
will receive with open arms.
For instance, the development of an aeroplane which
shall be safe for man's use. I think there is a greater
advantage to be derived from TRUE GENIUS in Ger
many than in other countries; and this is due to long
lineages of Geniuses who have sprung from the past,
being reborn throughout the ages; and this GENIUS
shall never die.

I may say I had but one great guide and comforter in
my temporal form (Franz Liszt), and he is still my com
forter and guide "over here !" He was the one man on
earth who fully understood and befriended me when I
was exiled from my father country. Oft he protected

To-day we are at the head of a great harmonic associa

who are now aspiring to bring forth upon your earth the
Music of a New Era.
Music is not MADE. IT IS BORN OUT OF THE
ETHEREAL WORLD; and it takes a man with a great
soul—one not living in the physical self—to produce a
perfect harmony which shall live forever.
One may easily judge my frame of mind when listen
ing to my own compositions; thus it is easy to judge the
frame of mind of any of the great masters, for our lives
are told in our compositions —not in books—but in our
music. This is our biography!
But only those who have the musical soul can fully

carried throughout Richard Wagner's Compositions was

We now love as any two may love, in harmony, and
her musical soul is now blended with mine in the new-
world life, and she now recognizes the soul of music as I
always understood it.
May I deflect to reply to the question I read in your
minds (the mediums), how best to avoid these rocks and
shoals which strand an ambitious life; men are so igno
rant in youth of their own fate of which they should be
Masters. If one in early life were but to weigh the Im
portance of one's acts in regard to one's future, one would
not inject into one's life possible disaster.
If one closely studied results for the future, one would
often avoid the stormy pathway, for failure in life is
more than often due to the Acceptance of NEGATIVE
FORCES, which drag one's Spiritual Genius down into
the material mire.
It may not always be the fault of the person affected,
and he may struggle to free himself from the meshes of
a dragnet— yet the final result is SUBMISSION! It is
often because he does not comprehend his individual
rights! —This is an object lesson through which my
readers may benefit if they grasp the truth of my state
ment.
It is often true that one's Surroundings are Accepted
as a part of one's forced Circumstances; in other words,
taken for granted. But when one comes into the correct
realization, this situation is in no way necessary. One
may build up a Spiritual Ring as a protection about one
self, allowing nothing Inharmonious to enter within this
Ring of Spiritual Force for Good.

himself to bar out all conditions that might tear down the

OTHER PATH TO SUCCESS IN LIFE. No matter
what the results may be to the offending Force, it must
be made to understand that it cannot POACH ON
OTHERS' SPIRITUAL GROUND!
This SPIRITUAL GROUND is the GOD-RIGHT OF
EVERY INDIVIDUAL, and must not be shattered to
tatters through ambiguous whims and material trifles that
often wreck the finer relationships of another's life.
And here is another way to overcome the Negative
Forces that would tear down your success: when retiring
at night, at the last moment of consciousness before drop

ENTIRELY, and become conscious only of the SPIR
ITUAL BODY, as if it were FLOATING IN SPACE

To this SPIRITUAL BODY DECLARE, that all

are nought to that Spiritual Body, and in no way a part
of it. Forget all incidents of life immediately, leaving
all Circumstances to the SPIRITUAL FORCE OF GOD
WITHIN THIS SPIRITUAL BODY WHICH COM
PREHENDS ALL THINGS.
One will quickly discover, that giving one's self over to
the SPIRITUAL BODY, means to lay all your perplexi
ties upon the Altar of Deity. In the morning they will

Do not try to solve situations for yourself. This was

A good woman helps a man to see the stars and the
clouds. He who travels alone is lost in darkness. A good
woman intermingling her life with that of a man makes
the complete unit of spiritual force. Without her, Ir
responsibility is engendered, and a void left which naught

In looking back over the many portraits of myself I

and place them in practical form for the enjoyment of
the world.
It was ever considered peculiar regarding my work
that I could not sing or play a musical instrument credit
ably. Ofttimes I had to wait years to hear my composi
tions produced.
Yet I was given, through the ethereal forces, a very
high Receptive Spiritual Intuition, through which I was
able to place on record that which came to me. Some
times I wondered if I were not insane! The fits of pas
sion which took possession of me to write the operas
which I heard within me and produced, were all ETHE
REALLY GIVEN, as if the Strong Hand of some UN
SEEN FORCE put them to notes.
My Spiritual Ears heard their Music pounding my
earthly brain. I could not have composed it with my ma
terial brain, for I really knew little of musical construc
tion, and this was always a puzzle to people how I could
have written "LOHENGRIN" having so little practical
musical ability.
It is a truth, that all geniuses are inspired from the
other side of the veil, and this eternal home is largely
composed of music! Even the voices of the spiritual
world seem to be musical.
The coarseness of earthly nature's vibratory forces
which man receives in his daily routine, is but the Ma
terial Reflection of his Material Self! The spiritual ear
of the spiritual body hears no such tones. It knows only
the highest and finest.
I have much to thank the earth life for, that Richard
Wagner's compositions are still fresh in the lives of the
musical world. I pay special tribute to my stepfather,
who greeted me upon my arrival "over here," and con
gratulated me upon my success. It was he who was
largely responsible for my creations!

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 257
My own father also greeted me. He had passed away
in my youth. Mother—bless her—kept our little family
together—later marrying a musical composer who made
his home with us. Ofttimes he took my sister and me to
the wings of the theater and seated us on a bench to listen
to his musical compositions. His music has passed, but
the good he accomplished was rewarded "over here."
When one discovers a genius and fails to assist him—
and extend the help really needed —he fails to help God.
For He it is who really plans that each man, in his own
way, be a part or UNIT OF GOD-FORCE toward uni
versal success.
Thus it is obvious that a world of fellowship and broth
erhood must aspire for this truth; one must help another
to reach his goal in life. Cooperation is progress ! Dis
integration is failure!
The whole business of life, if analyzed down to its main
basic point, is VIBRATION, WHICH IS GOD, HIM
SELF. And the nearer humanity approaches their apex
of ability, the more they will develop a keen desire to
Live, to Love, and to Help God and their fellowmen.
Returning again to the subject of music, I predict a
time shortly to come, when there will be an economic ar
rangement, by which all mankind may be privileged to
hear the higher classes of music. The greater population
of the world have little understanding of the beautiful
stories woven into opera and symphony —the blending
of tones and the thrilling crescendos.
But what the alphabet is to readers, so shall the full
value of music in time come as an education to illiterate
people, through their slow and intelligent climbing to an
adequate appreciation of this holy gift of nature.
To be illiterate in music is a great loss to humanity's
conception of the beauty about them and their possible
gratitude to God for His wonderous gifts.

258 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
So REACH OUT, dear mortals, and grasp, as part of
your earthly SPIRITUAL EDUCATION, the WORLD
OF RHYTHM in the air about you, and UNDER
STAND ALL NATURE AS A MUSICAL EXPOSI
TION, through which God is Expressing Himself to you,
and through which you may best appreciate Him!
Now before closing I wish to say a word to Father
Behr: Tell him I so often hold his hand and pen notes
which I pass into his compositions. Ask him if he ever
compared our compositions and realized their likeness?
He has a mighty soul ; and as a spiritualist would well
say, "an old soul" having been Reincarnated so many
times. When he returns again to earth, he will be the
greatest musical genius of his day.
Music, like any other issue, slowly grows upon one,
returning again in greater velocity of force in each new
birth.
Now I thank you, and bless you all, my dears. May
heaven's harmony be with you all, forever.
RICHARD WAGNER.
Henry Ward Beecher: You asked if I would speak
of the conventions which we hastened to, and I am pleased
to do so. Collect your wits and listen.

ITUALITY." Then I proceeded to follow the trend in
which my soul beseeched me to travel.
I found the True Realities of this clime far different
from what I had anticipated, for the reason, that there
was but a glimmering promise in my own dogmatic an
ticipation of the Happy Land.
But I saw that it EXISTED IN REALITY, all of
Ethereal Force as soon as I passed the border line. I saw
also the faces of my loved ones and those of others who
had entered into this life previous to my coming.
As I passed along on my way somewhere, they all
smiled and greeted me as if it were a merry out of door
gathering. There were woods and trees in an atmosphere
of soft azure; downy grasses underfoot; gardens of softer
and more beautiful impression than I had ever experi
enced. There was invisible music about, tones of higher
vibrations than any I had ever heard; and indescribable
scenes of a beauteous nature in the expansionless space.
I heard a consoling song, the music of which seemed
to lift me up and onward, I knew not whence; but in
passing it seemed as if I were viewing lantern slides. The
scenes changed, but I questioned not whither I was
bound. I knew only that I was Experiencing a SPIRIT
UAL REST and a DREAM OF ETERNITY.
I felt no suffering, no regret, because of leaving my
earthly condition. My "inner voice" urged me to press
on, "for you are destined to be a teacher and fulfill a life
far surpassing any experience you have known in your
past temporal life."
Yet I seemed to wander thus for days, although there
is no limit for TIME, SPACE or SPIRIT; and the
PROCESS OF ADJUSTMENT was merely another form
of nature which spirit entities pass through when they
first enter the spiritual climes.
There is a continual change and newness of sights, a

poral body is being disposed of on earth, and while those
nearest and dearest are adjusting themselves to their fate.
But at last I found myself awakened from this Spir
itual Form of Transition, and in a World of Reality of
Spiritual Dominion. The voices of those guiding me
did not seem like the voices of temporal men, but more a
Vibrative Force, and I could Read their Thoughts!
Seemingly it did not matter whether one had ears to hear
or not.
Everything was transparent and mental. The language
seemed to be English; however, THOUGHT IS TRANS
MITTED, and the nearest I could describe this to a
human is that it is an ELECTRIC FORCE which seems
to penetrate one's being. They did not have to open their
lips to speak, yet if one cared to do so he heard the
musical voice more efficaciously than when in flesh and
blood.
I was told that this was "SPIRITUAL POWER OF
THE UNIVERSAL MIND," as was also the ALL-
SEEING EYE; that which touches and feels matter.
It seems impossible to describe this to mortals. It is of
the same substance as the astral body which leaves the
material body at death, to which I wished to cling. It
seemed so unnatural to have nothing material as a co
worker with my mind.
But soon I discovered that I had no material brain, yet
my thinking ability was clearer and more vivid than ever
before. In fact it took much time, explanation and direc
tion from other spirits than those beside me, before I
realized that "MIND, IN EXPANSIONLESS SPACE,"
WAS JUST AS MUCH A PART OF MYSELF, AS
GOD WAS A PART OF THAT SPACE!

looked upon myself to be in my relationship to earthly
life. I WAS A UNIT OF INVISIBLE REALITY—A
PART OF THE ONE GREAT MIND OVER ALL!
Thus Sophistication dies an unpleasant death when one
discovers, that the Ego means so little after one finds
himself to be in UNION WITH ALL STRENGTH AND
POWER!
One finds, that one cannot work alone in "mental con
struction," because one's mind is a UNIT OF THE
WHOLE UNIVERSAL MIND! So those who do not
wish to adhere and work in the name of CHRISTIAN
SPIRITUALITY on earth, shall find much to be adjusted
when they enter the NEW LIFE, because they entirely
fall away from the SELF-PRINCIPLE, SELF-LOVE,
SELFISHNESS and all MATERIAL REALITIES—as
they are henceforth a UNIT of Nature's Growth and
Progress !
Yet strange to say, one does not lose an iota of one's
originality or individual identity, for one is the Origina
tion of a Particular Pattern ! To make the change means
—to unconsciously pass through forms of development—
to be Reborn into Higher Life!
Past lives are past creations! Man has thus passed
out into the Larger Form of UNIVERSAL GOD-MIND
EXPANSION; whereas the principles of the past orig
ination Evolve back into Another Man! This, however,
is very difficult to explain; but it is only as new shoots
spring up to the fallen redwood, or any new phase of
natural law.
When I found that I was a UNIT OF UNIVERSAL

comprehended that I was the "mind principle" of Henry

he lives in another noted divine, James L. Gordon; and
even now has another forerunner of New Spiritual Re
creation on your earth.
I found it a most delightful experience to talk with
various souls that had gone on before me, and who had
instructed me as I taught from my pulpit; and it is a
great experience and a most delightful reward to be with
them, and to lead and love the minds of those to whom
we have been naturally drawn on earth. If one has a
love for some special celebrity that has passed over, and
one finds natural inspiration in that line, do not believe
it to be owing to your own mental development, for it is
largely due to Inspiration received by your soul and his
Power to voice himself through you!
The mind of man never perishes, once man has trodden
earth's shores, for he continues the work he loved in his
Next Reincarnation. In all relations of endeavor, no mat
ter what the pattern of the individual's work was in his
temporal life, he does not discontinue his pattern, but
Lives and Continues through some one else ; and this per
son sometimes carries the work to the apex of success.
It is true too, that if one succeeds in Inspiring one's
Reincarnation sufficiently to achieve the work of the one
"passed over," at times he will grow to resemble, even
in facial expression, the person who once carried on the
same work.
If one could Visualize one's own Spiritual Body, one
would Visualize the Features of some one who is work
ing through him; and often this facial expression comes
to the surface and shows in the face of the earthly in

indeed the true Spiritual Form of the person who has gone
beyond, or his God-spark.
Now, Returning to my own First Impressions of Eter
nity, I remember seeing a place where countless indi
viduals seemed to be in great sorrow, crying out to be
freed and released from the misery of their consciences.
I saw countless angels of mercy trying to console them.
It seemed a place for the storm-ridden of life, and, as if
they had no place to rest their weary selves.
I remember that my spiritual guide told me this was a
place for the "earth bound" —those who had to relieve
the weight and woes of agonies of sinning, and this was
MIND-CORRECTION through which they would even
tually find the real God-light of pure truth.
Then I was told, that it was not my ordination to re
main there, but that at times I could come and console
those who needed me. So we went on until we found the
garden which I have described, and there seemed to be a
garden reception there of relatives, friends and celebrities
pressing forward to meet and greet me.
I remember I was perfectly happy over this reception,
and I really felt myself to be in heaven, and ready spir
itually to meet this reward; also to escape the sphere of
fear and terror —which in itself is an indescribable sen
sation.
Then it was that Paul came to me. He took my hand
and said I should go to a great spiritual sphere where
a convention was taking place, and where ordinations of
duty were assigned to those prepared to go on with their
labors.
I soon found myself in a place which shone like count
less diamonds, almost too delicate and ethereal to enter
into, and was told that it was called "Mary's Cross." The

of previously, was to tell you that I found Mary's Cross
at the beginning of my life "over here."
This is a center, where all minds of intellectual learn
ing are adjusted before their heavenly ordinance is as
signed them. The earthly mind could in no way com
prehend the endless space of this vast meeting place,
which much resembles a great arena, only all is ethereal.
It has seats, and they seemed covered with diamond dust,
yet transparent like dew, of such grandeur and beauty as
no physical mind could grasp.
In the center is a large thronelike place, where all the
"messiahs of earth" who have fulfilled their cycles of
work on earth are seated ; and these give their benediction
to the newcomers who are brought before them. There
seem to be no formal introductions or official duties; it
is simply a homecoming greeting.
"I had a feeling that I had seen this place before," and
did not appear to be surprised or elated when I found
myself being greeted with affection by the old Biblical
Characters; and I seemed to identify them from my
study and knowledge of them and their work. There
were no questions asked; I was simply placed in a new
situation in a new life.
They blessed me, seeming to shed a divine radiance
and power about me which penetrated my soul. I felt
its presence like a higher intelligent force within myself,
and also a great consolation ! Then a soft musical voice
spoke, saying, "GOD-POWER FOR GOOD be yours
for the Creation of a NEW SPIRITUAL REALITY TO

SPIRITUAL REGIME! I felt as if I had heard Christ
speak, but as I turned to look, there was only a Great
Radiance which enveloped my soul.
Then I seemed to have no difficulty in understanding
the duties which I was to carry out, and immediately be
sought the infinite minds of those who would aid me to
carry out Thoughts which seemed to over-power me. For
many days following I worked out my plans, oblivious to
all else, and the details naturally unfolded before me
without special effort.
It seemed perfectly natural to me to assume this task
although it was no simple one to unfold God's truths
into the manmade, misdirected life which I had left be
hind me. For an indefinite time I had to await the pos
sible comprehension of mortals to take hold of new spir
itual principles, and to cast away the old errors due to
men's Misunderstanding of God's plans for them.
The great Realities to overcome are the NEGATIVE
OPPOSING FORCES which work against God and His
efforts; and until men overcome this barrier and listen
to the voice of the SPIRITUAL SOULS trying to im
press and inspire them, Heaven is voiceless and cannot
Penetrate their Consciousness.
Thus it took me many years of slow process to bring
about the awakening of new knowledge in keeping with
all other progress. The only way, that our World of Rev
erence may be Recognized in its Vital Truths, is first to
Reach the Physical Consciousness of mankind, and Im
pregnate the Mind with Physical Phenomena; then gradu
ally the Spiritual Temple Within is Impregnated.
Physical phenomena are really Unnecessary "from now

for Science Proves that the SPIRITUAL POWER OF
GOD IS UNIVERSAL IN ALL APPLICATIONS!
In our conventions at Mary's Cross teachers are called
together to compare notes. One by one they come forth
and relate their accomplishments. These are recorded
and the highest in merit is made an example to be added
to.
New issues are laid out by certain judges for the better
"entering of physical souls," and to endeavor to bring
them together in brotherhood and mutual consideration.
Certain committees are appointed to work upon other ad
vancements and to return with their reports.
Although we are as "one universal mind," our work is
on an individual basis and ALL RESULTS MERGE
INTO THIS ONE MIND! The convention is going on
all the time without ever a recess. Each unit works upon
its own issue —there being endless realities to fulfil ! We
have absolute system and formality —a president who
presides, and he again is Guided by Higher Minds.
The President, who presided at the reception of the San
Domingo sufferers, was Diogenes! Those, in the Italian
disaster, were received and given counsel by that great
pathfinder, Homer —strange as it may seem! But a soul
is given the highest consolation so that it may forget its
torture of earth at once!
These great men of the past are always officially busy
in important matters, and care not for lesser details where
others may do as well. Time does not count with us, but
we have a "set rate of vibration" to accomplish certain
things. Only the Spiritual Mind would comprehend this
as plainly as you do your mathematical problems.

and economic systems. They spring up, and it is difficult

System. This is at present managed entirely for the Com
mercial god, without justice to the producer or consumer.
We also endeavor to implant God-standards even in the
minds of the heartless.
Last week we worked much, meeting the masses of new
souls who came Flooding into the Hereafter, due to the
proceedings of negative forces. Thousands and thou
sands of new souls had to be comforted and soothed from
shock. They must be individually met by loved ones and
taught immediately to understand their new surround
ings; then they are shown about and interested so as not
to realize grief.
They are as different as "Individuality itself to adjust"
according to their strata of earth life. We have also to
instruct lost souls that cling to earth realities, which takes
much time. But we are ordinated to guide them into their
new relationships with tact and God-mind.
We do not feature such catastrophes as calamities, for
it is in any event a great uplifting of their mental at
tributes; and they can be more useful on our side than
upon yours, for they are sooner or later able to help
Spiritualize your earthly mental constitution.

is,
that instead of "death" tearing down any

he

delighted to find himself of use in the spiritual world;
and he suffers naught from the deprivation of earthly

of this sort to do always.
I attended a convention with Horace Greeley at which
a new world constitution was drawn up—dedicated to the

by divine inspiration, lift economical and social rela

This shall be brought out in twelve different centers and
become a useful working constitution by 1937. You see
ideals bud long before they bloom: there are great ad

principles. The distribution of economic relationships is
a "first principle," and this will be adjudged, not by man,

Having this "spiritual contact," we are beginning to
EXTEND THE LAW OF VIBRATION, and the
POWERS, through which man feels God walking and
talking with him in his daily routine. We are triumphant
to be more and more recognized, which renders us more
efficient in adjusting earthly ill conditions brought about
by the tyrannical narrow meanness of Humanity.
The superstitious minds of the densely ignorant are
the most difficult to penetrate with thought waves of
knowledge, but we may say it is less difficult than even a
few years past. So we can say, that faster and faster will
man reach out into the Invisible—more quickly than man
can conceive, BECAUSE OF THIS WONDERFUL
OPEN DOOR WHICH SEPARATES US LESS AND
LESS!
SPIRIT IS THE LIFE-GIVING ENERGY TO THE

closer contact with you than you realize. It is man's
Self-established False Ideals that keep us from Spiritually
Enlightening you.
I may say, however, that I am well on my way toward

work through people in the mass. In the days of my
close contact with earth I could reach but comparatively
few, but to-day I reach countless thousands through Spir
itual Power, and they in turn disseminate the magnitude
of this God-work.
Each heavenly plane has a great center where the best
minds convene and arrange principles; then spiritual
messengers go to various places on earth and develop
and instill the lessons through mind transformation. So
no human mind need be clamped down, limited or mis
guided. If man reaches out into the great realm of God-
mind and listens to the God-spark within him, he will
find unlimited Knowledge, Wisdom and Direction.
The theme of all existence is the UNRAVELING OF
THE MYSTERIES OF SPACE! And when attempting
to solve this, man is enlarging his soul, which to him is a
divine pleasure. But this enlargement is lost when one
fails to understand that, it is a duty to live always as near
the God-mind and realm as one's instinct may direct.
He who is mechanically inclined is spiritually blessed
for we have a center for him. We are working on an in
vention which shall, photograph the action of a spirit.
A great invention shall be left to posterity by the Father
of Electricity (Edison) upon which he is now secretly
working. It shall bring to light the TRUTH OF SPIRIT
LIFE more than any other device.
There is also being planned an instrument to help man
to concentrate and become acquainted with his own body.
It will also photograph the "spiritual power" in the room
while the person is thoroughly concentrated. This in
strument will simply put down the negative opposing
forces and bring out the truth which God wishes exem
plified. Unbelievable as it may seem, this instrument
will Separate the Negative Powers from the Good, and
leave the Good Forces free to act.

ALMIGHTY SPIRIT OF GOOD! Through THY
GRACE, I come to give a special benediction and promise
to humanity, that Satan shall not always obstruct life and
progress, but that the earth shall BECOME A SANCU-
ARY FOR GOD'S PROMISES, for Christ trod the earth
in pain for this very purpose.
To THEE we dedicate our lives in this great triumphant
errand of mercy. We beseech THY HELP to Overcome

Lay THY divine hand upon the brow of Herman Behr

ceeded him in his pulpit in Plymouth church, Brooklyn,
1888, and we have been companions many decades.
But the reality of human life is not so valuable, so we
cling to materiality only in pleasant memories. In this
"newer life," GREAT VALUE IS PLACED UPON
EVERYTHING, great and small, so in a way this life
is very serious. Life seems insignificant as the human
passes through
it,
yet each one
is
passing through
a
stage
—a fixed status— Symbolic of the GREATER LIFE
which
is
to come. There
is
nothing mysterious or un
canny about anything here: everything
is
just
a
Natural
Part of the UNIVERSAL PLAN OF GOD'S UNVEIL
ING HIS WONDERS!
Humanity wonders concerning the whys and where
fores of his perplexities, his annoyances, temptations and
rough spots in life, but they are but to test man's strength
of character-building, which will finally show the makeup
of his Spiritual development.
It was most surprising to me when
I
came "over here,"
to find myself living in another and unfamiliar body:
I
was so impressed with the fact how immaterial my
physical body really had been and my material ideals,
for they all seemed as nothing. THE SPIRIT IS OF
ALL-IMPORTANCE!— And the POWER OF VIBRA
TION OR God-force BACK OF IT, should be given
Consideration as being the whole Import of Existence.
I
did not learn this in my physical life: and not until
I
saw myself formulated in this VAPORIZED BODY,
out of which everything originated as well. It was
a
sur
prise to me to have the experience of attending my own
funeral! There were my loved ones, sad and dismayed,
and
I
merely seemed to wonder "why their grief?"
I
felt sure, that they were the ones to be pitied, for
I
was
so much more alive than ever before, when
I
had my
material body to hamper my conquests.

I was surprised to see the pallor of my face, and I
wondered why this ghastly whiteness? Then it seemed to
dawn upon me suddenly that this was my own body, and
then I realized it was my alabaster shell. And here was
I gazing at
it,
all Elated, with no Responsibility only
a
KEEN DESIRE TO GO ON and Discover Greater
Things than
I
had ever known.
Yet
I
mingled for days, at times, around those of earth
whom
I
adored.
I
held their hands and caressed them.
I
put my arm about them in silent adoration, and
I
knew
when
a
feeling of peace and sweetness stole o'er them and
when they felt a warmth of consolation from my caresses,
as
if
I
had been able to kindle a fire in their souls.
Then
I
knew how GREAT WAS SPIRITUALITY,
when one could view
it
as
a
whole, and not as

;
and after spending what
I
judged
to be
a
few days and nights around my beloved, there
came to me some one whom
I
did not recognize, but he
seemed to know all about me, saying he was
a
great grand
parent who had passed away before my birth.
He seemed to know all conditions, through which
I
had passed and had been guiding me: in fact he was my
"spiritual guide," so he now opened the door of this new
existence for me to many whom
I
had been in contact
with and who now came to greet me.
I
was then taken to
a
great assemblage, seemingly an
out-of-door place;
a
sort of amphitheater built in the
most exquisite white marbles
I
had ever seen. Every
thing over here takes on
a
deeper grandeur and coloring
than the things of earth. And now this assembly was
waving branches of laurel in greeting, calling me

questions, "Why were all youthful, and no elderly people
to be seen—no gray hairs and beards like my own?"
Then I seemed to see a reflection of myself in a clear
pool, and all traces of age were gone.
This I could not understand; but I could ask ques
tions; and I was told that the Semblance of Age belonged
only to the physical relation; that the Spirit was always
Youthful! "Do you not feel its efficacy?" I was asked.
Why, of course, I did. There was no pain; there were no
regrets —only Song in my soul! I felt the Love of all
these people pouring out over me in consolation.
Bluebirds and robins and what not sang the most beau
tiful paeans of joy in the trees about me, and they echoed
all the beauty of youth with songs, immeasurably superior
to those of earth; and I marveled at this and remember
wondering: "Am I really worthy of all this?" And so I
asked, "Is this heaven?" My guide smiled and said,
"HEAVEN IS A STATE OF MIND AND WHAT

Yes ; I had made a new move on the checkerboard of
life, and I puzzled long as to why I should be so suddenly
lifted up and set down in such a place as this. Then I
took a notion that I was hungry, and I remember asking
if they were going to serve food. Some were singing
there; some were praying; some were merrymaking
Others were listening to speakers who stood upon a dais
in this sort of stadium. My guide smiled and said,
"Food is earthly, and you must forget"; but I remem

into the subconscious Mind, follow along into the beyond ;
and so, that I might not be unhappy, I was guided to a
great dining hall.
There were long tables placed in the shape of a horse
shoe, and I remember asking, "Why this Horseshoe Sym
bolism?" I was as curious as a boy who had dropped to
sleep on a train and awakened in a new place, and the
reply was that it was Symbolic: Significant of a Firm
Foundation in Friendship, Love and Truth ! And I caught
the Thought, that a horse must have a firm foundation
under his feet to drag his earthly burdens along. And
may I digress to say that horses are here with us in
plenty: with no more beatings, cold, hunger or drudgery.
They are merely used for joyous processions of victory,
or receptions to newcomers and such pleasures.
Then I remember feeling of the tablecloths. They were
beautiful, chiffon-like, and glistened as if set with thou
sands of pounds of diamond dust, but there was nothing
solid, yet there they were. The texture felt like a Current
of Vibration; the dishes seemed like those at home, but
more intricate in pattern and more beautiful; believe me
they were like nothing I ever saw in Boston or New York.
I remember quickly wishing that I could inspire some
one on earth to reconstruct their own, and how much
happiness they would bring. The delicate colorings were
mostly of pale pinks. Then someone handed me a goblet
and it contained a foamy pink substance which I tasted.
It tasted like nothing I had ever tasted before, and I was
told that it was "spiritual nectar." Now that did not
sound like much to me, yet I understood that it was a
beverage given to the newcomer for his "spiritual
strength" —a sort of spiritual refreshment.
Many things seemed to be served; nor was I the only
stranger at table. The place was filled; and now I am
going to tell you something that will tax your credulity:

for Saul, or Paul, who talked to the Corinthians stood at
the crux of the table, and was giving a short address upon
the "IMPORTANCE OF GRATITUDE" for all gifts
from God.
I was so impressed that I remember resolving firmly
in my mind that, now as I was free to go where I listed,
I was going right back where I came from and do my
best to instill in some people's hearts this beautiful real
ity. I was going to tell them never to fail to thank God
at mealtime for their gifts. I remember being appalled
how I had seen mortals devour their food and gulp their
drinks without one word of gratitude for it all.
And in his impromptu sermon Paul impressed all with
the fact that they were all equal in everything. I remem
ber that in my lifetime I had endeavored to talk upon
this subject; but, believe me, my oration was very in
significant to Paul's ideals regarding the vast importance
of classifying standards. At the moment I seemed to
VISUALIZE A PICTURE OF THE REAL TRUTH—
THAT EVERYTHING IS GOD'S PROPERTY—that
Nothing Belonged to Mankind.
My thoughts flashed back to many with whom I had
associations. What a price they had placed upon their
personal belongings! I thought "How silly—where did
they get them? Who OWNED their homes or their
wearing apparel? What BELONGS to anyone? Did
not Everything Originate with God?"
And I thought of the LOVE Emanating out before me
—LOVE—THE TRUE FOUNTAINHEAD OF ALL
THINGS!— DIVINE LOVE in which one must dwell—
or drop into the mire of the opposite of this picture. O,
if I could only come back and preach again in that dear
little church, the old Plymouth, and could Henry Ward

we would change the system of the "social order" in the
churches!
And may I pay a little tribute to Beecher: God Al
mighty never made a better man; and together we would
do away with all creeds! There would be no doctrines
and no sects. There are no Unitarians in heaven, no
Methodists, no Baptists. And WE Wonder, "Why loiter
along and place Fictitious Values upon the name of any
thing," when the Teachings of the Christ are UNIVER
SAL? He was sent to earth to teach man—EQUALITY
OF SPIRIT, and that every Individual was a UNIT,
WORKING WITH GOD FOR A PURPOSE!
And speaking of the Christ, I shall go on to relate my
first exploratory trip in heaven. I was told that in this
new form of life there was nothing mysterious. I did
know that humanity was but the flower in the making, and
each life only the unfolding of a "petal of knowledge";
also that I was absorbing the new knowledge here to feel
worthy, that some day I might see the Christ Jesus.
So far I had not planned to see God, for I seemed in
stinctively to know that I needed many new improve
ments before I could ask that privilege. People are chosen
by earth according to their merits; but "here" we advance
according to our learning and just find ourselves in newer
fields according to the operation and acceptance by us
of the Divine Organization.
Thus one day there was called together a special meet
ing; it seemed an assemblage, or assembly; and we were
to go to Uranus for special instruction. I did not seem
to know just who was to instruct us, but I was informed
to be ready to go with these people.
Well, I was merely "whisked" through space and soon
in very different surroundings. And whom did my eyes
behold but Christ Jesus standing in a white robe in the
center of a large number of people. His voice was soft

and consoling.
He did not speak in His mother tongue, but in the uni
versal English language, which is now used everywhere.
So thus I HEARD CHRIST SPEAK, the Great Master
over all teachers! He was talking of the PURITY OF
SPIRIT, AND THE DIVINITY OF SPIRITUAL CON
CEPT: and that the higher one raises one's "Thought or
Vibratory-force" for GOOD, the greater one's mind bor
ders on God-thought.
I should like to digress a little upon the subject of lan
guage before I leave
it,
for when first coming "over here"
I
was surprised to hear English spoken almost universally
and
I
asked about this, and was told, that
it
was the
Adopted Language of Heaven! that the God-Mind, the
Great Creative Spirit, really spoke this dialect, or its
equivalent in the beginning of time.
Also, that
it
was changed from its original dialect by
sectarianism and provincialism. It
is
not difficult for
other nations to learn, for
it
comes to them by absorp
tion. If one speaks in another mother tongue,
it
is
mostly to their own people for better understanding. The
English here
is
raised to the Spiritual Degree—
it
is far
more musical. And right now,
I
lend myself to the Crude-
ness of your dialect, so that
I
may seem natural to you.
When you come "over here," you will find, the language
to have much higher and finer vibrations than yours, and
grows more refined the farther one advances spiritually.
As Christ was speaking,
I
remember still clinging to my
past belief of seeing
a
personal God resembling flesh and
blood; and
I
was distinctly disappointed when
I
heard
the Great Master say, that God COULD BE VISUAL
IZED ONLY THROUGH THE MIND.
I
still believed
to
a
certain extent IN THE POWER OF MY OPTICS
TO SEE HIM, and

Christ—in Spiritual Form: as a man who is called God.
I clung to that ideal, and wanted to see God standing be
fore me.
But I found many, many other persons who coincided
with the sermon of Jesus: THAT THE DIVINE MIND,
ITS POWER AND STRENGTH WAS THE ACTU
ALLY EMANATING GOD HIMSELF!—It seemed all
very strange to me.
And there stood Buddha, Mohammed, Alexander the
Great, and many patron saints ! You have just celebrated
St. Patrick's Day largely as a joke. You did not know,
that he was a real patron saint of Ireland who Introduced
Christianity there, did you? But he did. And he stands
on a Pedestal with other worthy saints who have led men
to the Glory of the simple Christ story.
There was St. Colombo. I saw him distinctly among
the hosts of great men who had come here for instruction
—yet, after all, "Saint" is but a past earthly salutation.
We do not think of names as you value them. We think
of the "soul proprieties" of Mankind and what Humanity
fulfil IN THE NAME OF GOD—in their little day on
earth.
My name as Lyman Abbott does not mean much, but
WHAT LYMAN ABBOTT DID to AID THE WORLD
is what counts throughout the Spiritual Realm and the
records of time. And this accounting one has to bring to
God at one's transition, or so-called "death."
At this Spiritual Convention on Uranus, of which I
speak, I discovered THAT EVERYTHING IS VIBRA
TORY FORCE, and here I also learned to visualize this
FORCE. We visited a gorgeous palace thereon. Now
this may sound fantastic, but wait until you yourself see
it. There were Teachers therein who gave Instruction
regarding the ELEMENTS NATURE USES TO BUILD

From the spiritual palace I speak of are sent back to
your earth—through spiritual workmen —the great "elec
trical inspirations" which come into use there.
VIBRATION IS SPIRITUAL SUBSTANCE, in other
words, GRAVITY. Were it not for this "perpetual vibra
tion" all solid things would immediately crumble. VI
BRATION IS GOD. Small wonder He SEES AND
KNOWS ALL!
It took me a long time to understand this POWER
OF LIGHT AND LIFE: and that everything is entirely
beholden to ELECTRICITY, or VIBRATION.— For
IT IS IN ITSELF THE GREAT UNIVERSAL MIND,
that Compounds and Supplies all things of nature.
And so exact is this FORCE, that no man existing
could mathematically figure its Intricate Precision of
Power. That is a secret that we may learn some day—
perhaps I shall yet know. None that I have asked know
its secret, nor whether it is meant for them to ever
know it.
It was all very wonderful; also the time of instruction
before the higher thinkers and learned masters of life.
But it was not my privilege to remain there. I had to
return to the spiritual sphere surrounding Jupiter, which
is my spiritual abode, and I will tell you a few facts
about it.
The spiritual spheres of existence are so vast that no
one knows their limits. In my present condition I am
passing through a phase of spiritual existence, located in
an invisible spiritual world surrounding Jupiter. I do
not know where I am to go next, no more than in life did
I know where my spiritual abode would be.
Each of us is but fulfilling our part of God's Plan ac
cording to our limitation. Jupiter is an earth now in the

in your first book, THE NEW DIVINITY. Jupiter is
improving in its vegetation.
It has animal life very much like the first stages of your
earth in its prehistoric days. I may say that all worlds
in the making pass through the same phases your planet
has passed through.
I have had the pleasure of visiting Mars, and it may be
called an "electrical world." The personnel of the people
is magnetic. Through their thinking capacity they draw
to themselves everything that is needful to their life.
The atmosphere of Mars is highly vibratory in nature
—so much so that the flowers have a much higher coloring
than do those of your sphere. Everything is more mag
netized. There is greater power in life throughout every
thing. Mind is uppermost! Not along Destructive lines
and Ideals but leaning mostly towards the Constructive !
Religion is altogether spiritual. The entire belief
among the flesh and blood inhabitants there is, that the
Spirit of God emanates through all things, and to Him
all things are beholden. They worship no material gods
to bend the knee to, and do not believe in
a
personal God
of Heaven and earth—as many still do in your earth.
GOD IS ELECTRICAL VIBRATION, VIBRATORY
FORCE, to their way of belief, which ideal
is
far more
true and advanced than that of many other "spiritual
spheres" which we visit and contact. Thus
I
may say
"we are not regarded as material people," although
human, like myself, in mind, but having an ethereal body.
The Martians do not expect to see
a
"personal God," but
they all live in
a
Spirit of Love, and Morally with few ex
ceptions.
And there
is

them, of understanding and satisfaction. There

God, I was suddenly called to come face to face with the
Christ.
And that memorable Occasion gave to me a "spiritual
foundation" for ALL TRUTH. I heard other great minds
speak there and tell how the SPIRITUAL WORLD IS
ONE OF ABSOLUTE JUSTICE AND EQUALITY, all
VIBRATORY POWER AND PERMEATING ALL
CREATION!
There is no distinction between souls, except the diver
sities man has implanted in himself; each is arraigned
ACCORDING TO ITS PRINCIPLES OF MORALITY.
There is a place for darkened, wicked minds—where all is
dark. Minds there are clouded and cannot unravel con
ditions on account of their sins. They are Hampered by
Ignorance, and need help, prayer, sympathy, love, friend
ship, strength and devotion before they can outstrip the
material darkness they chose to bring upon themselves.
Evidently Lyman Abbott had few doubts or fears to
implant him in the darkness, yet I have dwelt there and
helped many to Visualize the Light of Day. In earthly
life one meets many who cannot see according to one's
own viewpoints; you may see a truth —they see the op
posite! But in conversation with them they catch a
glimpse of your viewpoint and begin to fathom it.
This broadens their mind-powers, and eventually —
more than often—these people come into your way of
thinking. Thus those in doubt "over here," or those
deeply steeped in sin, finally find their way out of this
darkness. But they suffer mentally —the deepest form of
suffering.

I consisted,—and everything else. Up until that time I
could not define myself —what I was made of.
To say, that Life is Vibration does not answer the ques
tion; and one cannot fully appreciate the depth and
beauty and strength of Vibration, until one searches in
this realm of spiritual realization for the truth of its fun
damental principle.
No earthly person can ever Comprehend these True
Secrets of Life, for his mind is not advanced sufficiently
to encompass them. ONE MUST GROW TO BE SPIR
ITUAL TO UNDERSTAND GOD! This Knowledge is
not "gleaned in a day"; and though I have seen the Christ,
I still feel that I am not worthy of all my blessings, —and
there is still plenty to be learned.
The principal reality here is TO LEARN TO LIVE
and LET LIVE! Love not with an Earthly LOVE, but
with a LOVE of Helpfulness and Sympathy. Life "over
here" Unfolds the Deep Truths of the Bible. It is like
an open book to us, wherein we all see its full psychologi
cal lessons and Dramatic Action as on a screen! We see
the morals of the stories and abide by them accordingly.
The material descriptions therein do not all fit in with
GOD'S PLAN. They are but interpolated, physical pic
tures, drawn by the Imagination for the ignorant to con
centrate upon through spiritual reflection, which we do
not need.
I studied the system of Bible lessons, and wrote a book
upon the subject. Clear, psychological reasoning has
been given, far more advanced than what I endeavored
to unfold, by HENRY WARD BEECHER in his new
book, THE NEW JERUSALEM. This, with his book,

be one of the most important strides ever made in the
past, and the most important for the future, for it means
the DISCLOSING OF THE LIGHT WHICH SHALL
FLOOD THE NEW ERA WITH THE KNOWLEDGE:
HOW MAN MAY LIVE AND GROW IN GOD-REALI
ZATION AND BE PREPARED FOR HIS GREATER
LIFE IN THE BEYOND!
The earth sadly needs this great BIBLE ELUCIDA
TION OF SPIRITUAL TRUTH AS A STANDARD
FOR LIVING, and at last it has come to their aid!
Now I thank you for your patience, and I see your
question: How was WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT re
ceived?
I can say that he is not at all disconsolate as to his new
realization, for his mind was one with God while he lived
his earthly life. His mind was broad and beautiful; and
as you well know it is the MIND that survives in the
newer life.
And thus he is to fulfil a "holy chair" just as soon as
he can adjust himself to new conditions. Like myself,
he is full of "wonder" at the new conditions, and much
is a puzzle to him. Special instructors in the great halls
of fame here and in various spiritual spheres await him.
He was always an instructor himself, thus he shall con
tinue along these lines.
His love of law will naturally become broader and
greater, and he will be a future judge of laws which come
up in your new ardor of life. I may say there is a niche
"over here" for William Howard Taft which he will ad
mirably fill. There was no selfishness in him, no egotism
or unprincipled ideals, therefore he will be one to quickly
be a part of the great body of eminent jurists now busily
drawing up new plans for world peace and righteousness.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 285
We struggle with God to put down Satan's hatreds,
malice and evil degradations.
Man must pay the price of holding to false gods by
sacrificing his happiness, but in the end of the story as
written in God's plan, all will be just and all will be equal.
I bid you adieu, and God bless you all.
LYMAN ABBOTT.
Henry Ward Beecher: Another week of promise and
truth. Now I have brought this morning one of your
most interested controls; one who is fervently working
towards establishing the world upon the truthful Foun
dation of TRANSCENDENTALISM or "appreciation
of spiritual thought," as a Foundation for RELIGION.
She will introduce herself:

Religion is Naught But Knowing God as
He Really Is
Good morning, dear ones (the mediums). This is in
deed Mary Baker G. Eddy, who has often before written
for you, specially endeavoring to put forth the beautiful
truths of TRANSCENDENTALISM, as being the
BASIS OF ALL RELIGIONS! And I shall indeed be
happy to see my book on the subject (to appear before
long) enjoyed worldwide.
And now at the request of the Rev. Henry Ward
Beecher I dictate this letter for your new Book, "Letters

from Eternity," and I hope my resume may reach the
minds of those, who do not understand the fact, that
every man has a "spirit-body," and that that "spirit-
body" naturally wends its way onward to its proper des
tination at physical 'death.' Then, at its pleasure, it re
turns to earth.
I pray the reading public, and especially the Christian
Science people, to comprehend this. To the latter I
reach out my hand in silent APPEAL to all of them to
grasp this simple truth from God; and to learn to KNOW
God, AS HE ACTUALLY IS —and to emerge from the
cramped chrysalis of narrow minds and impractical ideals
concerning the Power upon which all Depend for the best
Realities in life.
I was born into your world in a simple farmhouse,
springing from a family of true and sincere Worshippers
of Deity according to their best lights. Yet their Re
ligion was only in its budding, for a Religion, like any
thing else, passes through various phases of development
until it eventually reaches its apex.
Father and mother were satisfied with their faith,
mostly of the Calvinistic creed, and upheld the morale of
their day as discreetly as one would expect such to do. I
look back upon this creed as far too narrow for Spiritual
Freedom. I still believe that one's saintly trend should
in no wise be limited toward GOOD! more especially
when it Depresses Health and Spirit and Hampers the
BREADTH of man's wisdom.
In the little town of Bow where I was born there were
no places of worship. Father and mother's home was a
gathering place for prayer meetings when I was a child.
Concord was the nearest place of worship, and we oft
drove over there Sundays, or to mid-week prayers.
As to myself, I was considered an unusual child, though
always delicate. I remember that father used to call me

his "angel" because I was very pale. Oft he said my
eyes were like the stars of heaven to his view. He would
often gaze at the heavens and see the bright stars shining
there, and then look at me—saying, he saw them yet.
Possibly this was because I was indeed so frail and he
feared for me; for my eyes seemed to be my only life-
spark.
From the age of eight years, probably because of my
environment, I was greatly interested in Religion, more
so than in any other subject. People said it seemed
strange, that a little child preferred to sit at her grand
mother's knee and listen to all about the Calvinists,
rather than to play about the farm as other children chose
to do.
I wish to relate somewhat of my childhood life to lead
up to my subject, and especially to show that from
tender age on I was a born Transcendentalist. At eight
years of age I heard voices speak to me ! At first I would
run to mother or grandmother and ask if they had called
me, but they had not. They laid it to my imagination.
This I well knew to be impossible, for I distinctly heard
my name called again and again, "Mary."
For years I tried to solve —why an Invisible Voice
spoke to me! but it was not until I came "over here"
that I discovered that an Invisible Voice was really call
ing to me at that early age, and teaching me to Manifest
the Truth of TRANSCENDENTALISM— as being the
BASIC FOUNDATION OF RELIGION!
Had I appreciated, and obeyed this calling, my Reli
gion of Christian Science would have had a far superior
working Foundation; and without a strongly Established
Substantiality, Religion, like anything else, has little upon
which to mount itself. More than oft, Religions back
slide and totter, because they lack a Sufficiently Broad
Basic Foundation.

288 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
If each human being would thus question himself or
herself concerning their chosen viewpoints in religious
convictions, they could not TRUTHFULLY DENY IN
TUITION, AS A SPIRITUAL FORCE, Pushing them,
Urging them, Calling them, and Working THROUGH
them ! and thereby feel the Personal of God Within them.
During my youthful days there seemed to be always
SOMETHING LACKING in the Foundation of my
Elders' Religion. And I, being dimly aware of an IN
FALLIBLE FORCE Calling me, sought ever to authen
tically PROVE my Growing Convictions concerning cer
tain religious questions.
I think now, that in those days, there was not so much
Depth to Religion as a whole as at present. It seemed
rather crude. People knew not how to handle it satis
factorily to themselves, no more than a tender child
might handle Electricity. This fact held me back and
discouraged me to try and Prove WHAT I FELT IN MY
SOUL!
Finding no convincing Proof of the SOURCE or
CAUSE of my Pronounced Intuitiveness, I here make
the confession, that, because of witnessing so many the
atrical endeavors to Physically prove "superhuman wis
dom," I decided to have nothing more to do with Seeking
for its Source!
But at a certain period, my mental intuitiveness told
me to write down my thoughts and philosophy concern
ing the Infallible and Real Principles, which I did. And
in my writings I had the opportunity to aid the world by
admitting and publishing the Truth, which I knew Ex
isted in Transcendentalism, or Advanced Spiritualized
Thought and its Source. But, as yet, my knowledge of h
had not advanced far enough for Humanity to compre
hend and receive THE TRUE KEY to it.

ingly I could not write anything tangible, and the world
was led to believe that I, Mary Baker G. Eddy, was
AGAINST THE TRUE FOUNDATION OF ALL RE
LIGIONS, OR SPIRIT RETURN, and the Nearness of
God to man, as Christ told the world about.
To a certain extent I believed thus, yet there was not
a day or a night that I did not acknowledge this INTUI
TIVE FORCE from God, and Converse through my pen
with my Spirit-helpers —the Forces of Human Continuity
on the "other side of the vale."
However, I believed, conscientiously, that "Spirit Re
turn" was only realized through the MIND CHANNELS,
not through the actual presence of Spirits. I did not
know, that by thinking of those on the "other side," their
presence was TRULY WITH ME; but when one once
BELIEVES in this perfectly natural LAW OF VIBRA
TION, no one will deny, that Like Attracts Like!
These VIBRATIONS are the true Realities of Exist
ence of the ego, excluding the bodily functions; for the
body is but earth matter, and belongs entirely to its own
specific relation —that of earth's solids. The VIBRA
TIONS OF GOOD that govern solids are GOD HIM
SELF, and are the True Element out of which man be
comes Real, and Everlasting, strange as it may seem.
But there are two distinct Forces of Vibration, for
everything in nature has its opposite; and Negative Vi
bration Vibrates AGAINST GOD-FORCE. The Nega
tive Forces are the tearing down and destructive elements,
Distinct and Separate, and at times more powerful than
the Affirmative Forces of God; and they emanate prin
cipally through man-made attractions.
God, in truth, is altogether Spiritual and all Good.
He has no other mission; and I trust this explanation will
give my readers a clearer and deeper knowledge regard
ing the Working of Vibrative Force, and the necessary

standards to build up the fundamental principles of Ven
eration for God, the Mighty Deity.
Upon the Basis of Intuition for Good, I was led to
Magnify CHRISTIAN SCIENCE as a Truth, and the
whole practical Truth if rightly understood.—However, it
left out God! as being the whole Backbone and Source
of all things. This omission of basic scientific principle
on my part I cannot explain, except that it was brought
about by Negative Forces, unconscious to myself.
To believe in MIND, as SPIRIT, or the God-spark in
man, one must comprehend and know, that one's Spirit
will CONTINUE ON IMMEDIATELY, in a Practical
Light of further Development and Usefulness. It does
not fade away into some invisible element of doubt, for
most naturally the SPIRIT OF MAN is a Working Unit
of POWER FOR GOD.
To lose sight of the Personality of man as being a God-
spark of Divinity —is to lose Faith in the "Actual Con
tinuity of Life" on the other side of the vale. We may
liken this to the adventures of Christopher Columbus and
his mariners, who believed in Something in a "vague be
yond," yet feared continually, that if they advanced fur
ther they would drop into an open void, they knew not
to where.
But Columbus himself who had no manmade fears,
cheered his mariners on into the newer life of promise
and hope, and thus he brought an indefatigable discovery
to the earth. And I have but the one regret, that in my
lifetime, being thus gifted with Intuition, I did not lead
my barque to a still better Harbor of Truth.
I should like to define this word "Intuition" as mean
ing really clear "Spiritual Visualization"; and to gaze
with Faith into the void beyond the earth and divine its
truths. Having this Intuition, I regret, that I did not
stand up against my own negative elements, and at the

proper time convince the world, that there is naught to
keep Man and the Infinite apart, except that which his
own mind-concocted stumbling-blocks create. These are
the only bars against Knowledge of the GREAT
TRUTHS OF NATURE and a practical and perfect
HEREAFTER.
As I look at the subject of human continuity at this
time, the world seems to be made up entirely of MIND-
VIBRATION. It is the material of which GOD CON
SISTS, and of which we, as SPIRIT-FORCES, also con
sist. It constitutes our entire atmosphere of conditions
and surroundings.
It seems so perfectly natural to live in this life "over
here." If human eyes possessed the glory of Psychic
Vision, the physical world would mean very little to them,
for it is but a temporal means of development, just as the
butterfly dwells in the chrysalis for a short time and then
flies to a more beautiful life.
I pray that all the world will become more intent to
know and acknowledge the Beautiful Truth of their close
Spiritual Relationship with GOD; that each individual
will realize that he walks hand in hand with Deity, and
has the comfort of this fact.
Man has too long been pent up in his physical nucleus
of matter, and loath to part with his ignorance and nar
rowness; and this fact makes his Religion incomplete, as
I see it to-day, without a proper Basic Foundation and
its practical import.
The Bible cannot be completely understood by the
student, or by him who reads it without proper Intuition.
The SPIRIT OF GOD is not a man of flesh and blood,

OF LIFE, permeating all Nature —knowing all things—

seeing all things, and Man's Human Continuity is a part
thereof.
God is busily engaged in accomplishing His work of
progress and upbuilding —hand in hand with His helpers
—mankind! He is everywhere, all in all, Alpha and
Omega. And every human being is a Unit of that Mind-
force, working with Him, and represents Him through his
industry on earth. Man is but Emanating DIVINE
WISDOM with the Aid of God and His Spiritual Help
ers, and the greatest mistake any Religion can perpetrate
is to DENY GOD PRESENCE and SPIRIT RETURN.
The MIND OF GOD is everywhere at once! and this
is the only possible solution of God's knowledge of all
things. Now tell me why any one of His Units should
place any LIMITATION on this UNIVERSAL MIND
OF GOD? Man, being a Fraction of this MIND OF
GOD, has the same Universal Knowledge if he but
chooses to use it. Thus he may establish a Basic Spiritual
Foundation of God-force within himself!
But until the world at large Accepts the Truth, that
MIND IS LIMITLESS! and that no one unit, or man,
has a Right to Arbitrarily PLACE A LIMIT on MIND!
how can the Solid Truth be Universally Established, or
true, comforting, reliable faith have a firm foundation?
Owing to his mistaken viewpoints, man suffers all his
life through evils and pangs of various perplexities, but
he need only, by means of these lessons, to Conform to
Proper Standards of Thought, or Purity! This is as near
as one may Represent or Pattern Divinity.
Man often wonders why he must encounter these
storms in life! It is largely to Awaken him to his TRUE
MISSION on earth and his Rightful Relationship to
Deity and the Hereafter. Man may rest assured that
every apparent drawback is but another lesson, that he
may advance in spiritual thought.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 293
It may seem queer that I ever speak of Negative Quali
ties, but now I know the truth about life; and that no
one, in truth, can deny that which is constantly forced
into notice; for the psychical concept is distinctly related
to the physical part of earth life. If a man had no trials
he would depend less and less upon his Intuition or Spir
itual Power from God, or the Vibrative Phase of its Di
rection.
And I can say, that I now know, that the many, many
trials of my own life were merely stepping-stones for me
to obtain Experience and be able to give others the Bene
fit received therefrom. So, dear readers, be not discour
aged, if through unforeseen "negative forces" you also
encounter trials, and perplexities, out of which you must
work your way. For only through these means will you
find the Higher Freedom, the Higher Knowledge and the
Greater Appreciation of the Spiritual Assistance of God.
God-force consists of Elements, that each and every
individual MAY UTILIZE AND MOLD, absolutely to
their own liking. It is Limitless and the ALL-POWER
FOR GOOD! Humanity may spread its divine glories
broadcast; or intentionally crush them under Physical
and Carnal Convictions!
LIFE IS A BOOK ABOUT RELIGION— to be Lived
and Studied as to Spiritual-power or Vibration. It is free
for all to use. And the life LIVED BY EACH INDI
VIDUAL depends entirely upon the MAGNITUDE OF
HIS MIND and how he Handles this Spiritual Force
which Constitutes his Life and FINAL RECKONING!
I really believe it shall not be much longer ere Human
ity will Comprehend all the Practical Laws of Nature;
and that LIFE and SPIRIT, and RELIGION, and
MIND, are all one and the same thing —the GOD
WITHIN THEIR VERY SELVES ! And when Human

the face of the earth, a Standard Religion not subject to
change or doubt; but will forever be Steadfast, as the
TEACHING OF CHRIST— and the Fundamental Men
tal Root of Higher Thought for all generations to come.
It would not be practical to believe, that the religious
ideals of the present generation would be the ruling ideals
for future generations to follow, when we may read back
over the records of time and notice how former ideals of
life have advanced to new practical relationships, befitting
each age in which mankind function.
Thus I feel, as do all the Good Spiritual Forces of Eter
nity, that this letter SHALL NOT GO AMISS; but will
teach the reading public, that man cannot hold set and
dried-up dogmas for long; but that his Faith—like the
trees and the flowers—shall throw off the old decayed
leaves of time and take on new and glorious ones —also,
that any RELIGION THAT LIMITS ITSELF to a cer
tain climax, CANNOT HOLD GOOD—unless it contains
the TRUTH OF TRANSCENDENTALISM, or BASIC

I have written this letter especially to convince the
open and receptive minds of the brilliant generations of
the future coming to earth, THAT GOD IS LIVING
MIND VIBRATION ON EARTH AND IN AIR; a
God of SPIRITUALITY, PERMEATING THE COS
MOS!— and that MIND, TIME, SPACE AND ETER
NITY ARE LIMITLESS!
Also, that Knowledge, or Wisdom, IS THE ONLY

Represent the Spirit of Life, or Vibratory Force of God,
which is the basic platform or strata of life.
These are facts that Jesus endeavored to implant into
the minds of mankind. His endeavors were little appre
ciated in His time. It has taken more than two thousand
years for humanity to learn the Truth about His "invisible
working forces" ; this being, that he was a Unit in Vibra
tion with God. But this same principle extends alike to
all mankind, the results depending only upon man's de
sire to grow Mentally, and his degree of Self Respect, and
his Ability to Absorb and Apply Intuitive Wisdom!
An especial virtue is to love thy neighbor as thyself.
There is no dividing line between the Physical and Spir
itual issues of life, except the barrier which man chooses
to build and with which to bind his Spiritual Insight.
All good growth is mental! "Over here" our percep
tions of life are all mental ; thus man may realize the ad
vantages of a good start in Mental Growth before arriv
ing here. If man in his temporal growth desires to more
thoroughly understand the "conditions of eternity," he
must constantly endeavor to develop the Spiritual Ear, or
his Natural Power of Intuition, and not the things per
taining to the physical or earthly curriculum.
Man's mental abilities must REACH OUT TO THE
REALM OF ALL-SPIRIT! and Visualize a perfect pic
ture with no limitations —all-harmonious and true. Man
should not worship the outer tangible garments of earth;
but should cling to the FORCES VIBRATING
THROUGH him—bringing him superior knowledge—
which, as I have said before, is of God Himself!

These people Understand the Principle of this Force
with which Jesus performed his miracles. God intended
this Force as a gift to all His children to be developed

being THAT PART OF THE THINKING CONTIN

When Transcendentalism, or Spiritual Thinking is

can be accomplished in the light of Christ-truth; and

TRUE TRANSCENDENTALISM, as the BASIC
PLATFORM OF ALL RELIGION!
And this basis shall be, that Death shall lose its Sting,
because Humanity will have learned the art of developing
their sixth and seventh senses which now lie dormant in
man. These senses are the seed implanted in man since
the beginning of creation; and no one can live any nearer
to God than through the simple and honest practice of
thought and action along their line.
It was but perfectly natural for me to pass out of
physical life and along into my predestined course. I
never intended to deny PHYSICAL DEATH. What I
DENIED WAS DEATH OF THE MIND! I knew the
body was material and must return to the elements, but
all do not comprehend this difference in teachings.
Had I not believed, that MIND was Everlasting and
could not die, I would not have spent the greater part of
my life on earth in developing my Intuitive Thoughts and
preparing for the Hereafter. I lost no opportunity to
know MORE ABOUT THE TRUTHS OF GOD'S

I sincerely trust that this letter will cause much up-
springing of thought; for to stir up thought is to stir up
the dregs of stagnant and too settled depths, and clarify
basic principles; it causes that which is obscure to rise
to the surface and be skimmed off, clarifying all the

Clamoring for SIMPLE TRUTH and the SIMPLE

Christ was the greatest Christ Scientist and Psychologist
and New Thoughter that ever lived. A true replica of
God-thought, represented in man.
I am glad for this opportunity also, to say, how much
I learned from Dr. Quimby. He was a sincere and gifted
man, and had the knowledge of many phases of utilizing
Spiritual Power. But I thought best to concentrate upon
one phase, and I yet believe that therein Dr. Quimby
faltered finally in the eyes of the public. He was gifted
in animal magnetism, hypnotism, healing through sug
gestion and many such arts. The real back-ground of
his marvelous manifestations was Spiritual Power of the
Invisible World working through him. But he was too
versatile to my mind for his own good. But no matter
what phase he manifested, he used it for good purposes;
and he was the instrument in making of me a sound and
healthy worker for God.
And thus Humanity may segregate the GOOD from
all man-made Religions, and compound a comforting be
lief of their own. I should like to meet the person who
has not received a comforting lesson from any and all
Religions manifesting God in the highest sense. Other
wise they could not be just to God in carrying on the
work He planned for them, and which they contend to
accomplish. And in what way does this rob any Reli
gious System of its credit?
RELIGION IS BUT THE applied UTILIZATION
OF KNOWLEDGE FOR GOOD OF THE VIBRA
TORY FORCES! And this Gift of God, being a part
of Him, is LIMITLESS and FREE! And anyone may
mold it individually. Hence one must see to
it,
that, in
thus molding this Sacred Force of progressive nature, one
adds
a
bit of BETTERMENT to the Leaven for the
benefit of future generations.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 299
Now I thank you for your time and attention; and you
may add that I am greatly pleased over the success of the
Mother Church of Christian Science, and the great strides
being made in SPIRITUAL HEALING. Many are ac
quiring a better Understanding of the SOURCE OF
THEIR SCIENCE, WHICH IS GOD-FORCE.
The Christian Scientists of to-day are actually utilizing
Vibratory Force as their guide with marked success in
healing, whether they admit the truth of it to themselves
or not. . . . Now a holiday greeting to all. Amen.

I have the pleasure of introducing to you GEORGE
ELIOT?

An Eclipse Visitor
Yes, this is Mary Ann Evans, sometimes called Marian
Evans. I appear this morning (April 28/30) of your
"eclipse of the sun," and I may liken it to the eclipse of
practical sensible SPIRITUALITY almost to totality
upon your earth. Humanity have little realization of
the truth, that the IMMINENT PRACTICAL GOD, AS
HE IS, EXISTS IN VIBRATION THROUGHOUT
THE COSMOS.
This in spite of the fact that the golden sun of God
has for centuries tried to picture His "eclipse" to man
and remove the Moon of Doubt from the face of the
earth, and uncover the Life-giving Face of God. When

this true Spirit of God will penetrate the mind of every
man, no longer will He be eclipsed by false and lesser
lights.
Mother Nature plainly teaches this lesson to each of
her children in her every mood and picture; especially
when Lady Moon—traveling her unerring orbit —passes
between the earth and the sun; then how dull and lan
guid is the face of all things without that great smile of
God encouraging humankind; and should the moon for
forty-eight hours cover the face of the sun —all life would
well-nigh perish.
Without LIGHT on any principle, there is no "life"!
LIGHT IS LIFE! The Electrified Force of the Sun-rays
is the VITALITY OF GOD and your RELATIONSHIP
to the SPIRIT—the Vitality of your Personal Spirit!
Mother Nature shares in all our blessings, for she it is that
takes care of the physical things of life. While VIBRA
TION— in the form of God-units—cares for the SPIR
ITUAL Principles of Life.
I, too, once a writer on your globe, still unfurl my
scroll of intelligence as a UNIT of God in His works.
Perhaps one might say, not as an individual, but as ONE
UNIT working with God. When MIND, or SPIRIT, is
once freed from the burden of a mortal body, it takes its
part in God's work of progress and evolution. And,
strange to say, it shares equally with the Great Al
mighty Intelligence that systematizes all things.
And thus it
is,
that all worthy minds BLEND INTO
ONE MIND IN THE NEWER LIFE. We, in our
"new state of being" are all ONE IN THOUGHT, ONE
IN LOVE, ONE IN SERVICE and System of Direction.
And before writing further, may
I
extend my earnest
congratulations to your noted publisher, HERMAN
BEHR, and say, that in reading his mind,
I
find the same
relationships which distinguished my friend Goethe?

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 301
He was a particular friend of my only love, George
Lewes, and to this day can be found at Stratford on Avon
a bust of Goethe which love prized so highly in the home
of our intermingled interests. Goethe was always our
staunch foundation of truth, and from his teachings we
truly received God's blessings. To me it is a world of
consolation to visit Herman Behr, for he is again ful
filling the work of Johann von Goethe. Our Spiritual
Love goes out to him, who is extending the glories that
Goethe began in his day and age upon earth.
We, the people of yesterday, oft intermingle in his
earthly study. And thus though invisible, we may be
staunch friends and literary companions. Thomas Hux
ley, Herbert Spencer, the Martineaus, Ralph Waldo Emer
son, and so many others. In my girlhood, my first inspira
tion to become a writer came from the good fortune of
meeting Ralph Waldo Emerson who was touring England
on a lecturing trip. We found ourselves interested in the
same literature.
Well do I remember his bright smile when he asked
what was my favorite book, and I replied "ROUSSEAU'S
CONFESSIONS." He had a copy with him and read
from
it,
daily: so thus was our friendship linked even
unto eternity.
But the onward and upward march of life
is
never with
out its touch of human interest, sadness and disappoint
ments, and those who have read the life of "George Eliot"
well know that IN HER HEART Christ always dwelt,
yet in her social standards she was somewhat outcast
from some circles of society.
I
will not dwell upon this
subject, but
I
do wish to make amends to the world for
seeming misdemeanor.

A
THING AS MARRIAGE OF
THE SPIRIT AND NOT OF THE FLESH! ONE
TRUE LOVE COMES INTO EACH LIFE! and LOVE

SEEMS AKIN TO DUTY— although it may set aside
a certain richness of beauty, or seem an insult to social
standards, especially when carried out in those primitive
days. But I am proud to say, that not once before the
face of God did I, or did George Lewes ever disobey
God's commands.
When TWO SPIRITS ARE TRULY LINKED
HEAVEN BEGINS ON EARTH! Critics need never
dip into scandals, for under God's great system, EACH
PERSON PAYS HIS OWN DEBTS IN ETERNITY
under God's judgment; and it behooves each person to
keep his own slate clean, he will have enough to attend
to in eternity on that basis. If this were not solemn
truth, there would be no TRUE JUDGMENT in life
principles on your EARTH or THEREAFTER.
The question has oft been asked as to where Mary Ann
Evans obtained her education? And I will reply, mostly
from my struggle for higher thinking! No matter how
hard were life's conquests—I always found time for
much reading and asking questions. It was the hunger
of my spirit which prevailed! Hence from the "invisible
realm of thought" or Spiritual Vibration—I received my
education.
Not from any professors of earth did I learn, for there
was no money to pay tuition; so my education was re
ceived from silent conversation with the INVISIBLE
FORCES —well calculated to give me instruction —and
this was a secret of my life: a fact which is now well
nigh common knowledge. It seemed strange to me at
that time, that I should be interested in principles so be
yond my comprehension: sciences, philosophies, and in
terests —especially in the Invisible Forces of Nature.
But I may truly say, they were not secrets to me; and
I could in my time have written many strange uplifting
facts, but they would not have been understood or ac

GUAGE from some renowned teachers of the Invisible
World, strange as this statement may sound, and I took
notes from their dictation, which will sound bizarre to
many.
And thus it is advisable that all Spiritually minded peo
ple should depend upon the Higher Intelligence of THOSE
GONE ON BEFORE as they intermingle in human af
fairs, for it is thus they discover TRUTH upon TRUTH
which has never before been imprinted on parchment.
The Divine Intelligence of the SPIRITUAL KINDRED
is far more intellectual than any dwelling in the physical
concept.
May I venture to hope that every one who reads these
lines will begin an endeavor to understand the secret
principles of that higher knowledge, that they may attune
their "receiving set" and become personally imbued with
the knowledge of Shakespeare and Bacon, Huxley and
Spencer, the Martineaus and Emerson, Henry Ward
Beecher and Abraham Lincoln, and all other men of note,
who are just as much a part of the physical world as they
ever were.
In our trend of "natural being" we lose no sight of
your lives nor do we desire to do so. It is our whole duty
TO ELEVATE MANKIND IN THOUGHT and to
teach all higher principles to humanity. No human can
realize the responsibility of raising, and the significance
of uplifting men out of the morass of ignorance, until they
come "over here" and LIVE OUR LIVES IN THESE
SPIRITUAL GRADES; for we know—being so much
more magnified— MAN'S DUTY TO GOD, and HIS
PLANS FOR HIS CHILDREN.

THE SPIRITUAL EAR for the hearing of Higher Vibra
tions than those of earth.
To do this, is to learn the Significance of the DUAL
PERSONALITY OF MAN! The OUTER PHYSICAL
BODY, which Magnifies the EARTH LIFE, and the
INNER SPIRITUAL BODY, which Constitutes the
SPIRITUAL LIFE! One person is only more capable
than another through his giving more Credit to the
SPIRITUAL SOURCE of his knowledge.
The invisible link between the two personalities is God
—the Holy Spirit or DIVINE FORCE, MAGNETIC
VIBRATION, or whatever one chooses to name it—that
holds the two bodies, as well as all else, together. And
thus one learns the significance of the phrase "I and my
Father are one." The whole "symbol" of the TRUTH
OF NATURE— is the LINK OF GOD-POWER between
the SPIRITUAL and the PHYSICAL BODY.
What directs the countless planets in their course but
this same GOD-POWER? Fields far too vast in dis

stowed on the human mind when He came into His realm
of thought on earth. I had the fascinating pleasure of
translating a life of Christ in my lifetime, and I may
truly say that oft since coming "over here" have I had
the pleasure of being in His presence and listening to His
teachings. He lectures much of the time.
He is PERFECTLY natural in demeanor—just as He
was in His life upon earth. He was then seldom aware
of His earthly body, but lived in the Consciousness of
His Spiritual body at all times; and this is the main rea
son why people felt His life difficult to understand, be
cause they expected much Ostentation and insisted upon
placing him upon an artificially glorified platform.
But nol Jesus carried out the simple forceful plan
of natural law, and endeavored to teach the SIMPLICITY
OF IT ALL to the world, when the world was not suffi
ciently mentally developed to understand His sayings
and manifestations of natural laws. To-day they are so
much more readily understood by humanity, and the JOY
OF LIFE IS, THAT HE LIVES RIGHT AMONGST
YOU, so He Perceives the Growing Understanding of
NATURAL LAW.
Although His body is finished, His Spirit has never left
His beloved earth permanently, as most individuals choose
to believe. He works in "spiritual effort" as one against
ten thousand ordinary teachers. His mind is perfect and
He continues to Expound the Glories of the Cosmos; and
He still grapples continually to hold His own against evil
relationships which men persist in bringing upon them
selves.
But the world is now beginning to understand this state
ment, and to feel the reaction of their own misdeeds and
the manhandling of God's Plan for His children; and also
to know that Christ truly walks the earth, a welcome
Spirit to many. Yes, this is so! Though now invisible,

306 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
He is a mighty Power for Good, and His Spirit and His
works shall never perish.
If a man fulfills God's Plan for him while on earth,
though his physical body returns to dust, his Spiritual
Body lives on forever! Christ left no marked books to
establish His memory, yet He wrote for the Salvation of
mankind —forever on the sands of time.
We truly marvel at your modern expansion and syste
matical precision. In looking back to my childhood days
of absolute quietude and monotony, a real content existed
in our nook of the woods. No hubbub nor hurly burly
as of this day. I worked among my primroses and
watched well fed horses draw high carts to market laden
with new mown hay. Happy apple-cheeked wives drove
by with a smiling "good day," believing that the content
of the world was theirs.
There was no haste to slip through life as now, which
is but a fallacy. In hurrying through life one loses the
depth of all nature and all principles, and lives entirely
on the surface of the material plane of knowledge; so I
mention these homely scenes that I may paint a picture of
content and restful spirit in this world of action. Man
now feels that he has a great advantage over the past, yet
with our simple souls, we knew God at His best.
Man now retires at night with a kaleidoscopic torrent
of life moiling through his brain, while the simpler life of
yore gave to humanity but one or two events a year of
note to digest and analyze; yet I think we had the best
balance, for now man gets little of the JOY OF LIFE!
He takes everything simply for granted, and his daily
contact reflects MATERIALISM, not SPIRITUALITY.
We climbed upon stools and popped into our canopied
beds among the feathers, thankful in our heart, that God
had given us restful peace and exit into the REALM OF

BODY, bringing to it a wealth of thought. How few
know that slumber is the Unlinking of the SPIRITUAL
BODY from the PHYSICAL; that the SPIRITUAL
BODY leaves all Physical Contact and hovers about, or
goes off into space.
It is thus fully in touch with the Invisible Vibrations
and forms of the beloved departed, bringing back restful
messages and physical healing. This creates peace and
comfort. When one slumbers one is alone with God and
His Health Imparting Vibrations and Knowledge.
And now in bidding you adieu I may say, that Shake
speare's country is my favorite abode when I mingle with
earth people. In life one has a favored and hallowed
spot. I traversed that country oft with my father who
was a land overseer and a worker. He taught me to love
every inch of the land wherein I dwelt and rode about
in a little jumble cart; and it was he that gave me my
philosophy.
A mother's love I knew not, for mother passed away
into the larger life, before I was old enough to know a
mother's mission; but I learned my lesson through the
fond care I bestowed on the little family left me to rear.
It was thus I became heiress to that immortal throne
of the women who realize GOD-LOVE through
MOTHERHOOD— though it be the LITTLE ONES OF
OTHER HEARTS!
That little family is still with me in my home in Venus
to-day, and we share our Poetry and Romance under
Spiritual Direction wherein DIVINITY is our refuge.
I think my favorite among my works is "SILAS
MARNER." It tells a story of SERVICE TO MY SEX,
giving them a GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF
MASTER-STRENGTH AND COURAGE, THAT
THEY MIGHT LOVE AND OBEY WITH THE LOVE
I HAD FOR ALL MANKIND!

that he is protected by the ethereal forces who have
chosen him as an instrument to give unto your sphere a
NEW OUTLOOK UPON LIFE.
May he be fully compensated in spiritual peace and
true happiness, here and hereafter. If you ladies could
but know him : so well spiritually constituted, his psychic
senses well developed, so much so that he has little need
for his physical self. If all men could develop his sense
of living their lives as spiritually, what a world yours
would be! AND IT SHALL BE.
There is but one pathway to the development of SPIR
ITUALITY: and that is to create and develop in the
heart the LOVE OF GOD in SPIRITUAL TRUTH, and
not live only along physical lines.
Do you know where civilization fails in its attempt to
create heaven on earth? It builds for itself a super-fan
tastical, physical, impractical GOD. where it should build
a SUPERHUMAN, SPIRITUAL GOD, DWELLING
RIGHT WITHIN THE HEART OF EVERY MAN—
not a far-off God as thought of in the days of yore.
Now for my subject:
As you shall find by looking up my biography, I passed
out of this life at the age of forty-two, all too soon ; yet
it was a life well-spent in fulness of the spirit.
My father, George Austen, was my only love. We
were a large family, all having literary ability. My father
most acclaimed me; and it was a great consolation to me,
in the last ten years of my life, to look back and realize
what my service had meant to him.
We would go for long walks together, when he was able
to be about, studying the characteristics of the people
whom we met and prayed with, and advised and helped in
our daily tramps throughout the vicinity of the rectory.

DICE. They were not UNREAL PEOPLE, but people
who were very real to father and myself.
To be a successful writer, one must take part in the
human interests in life of those they write about. Other
wise there is a lack of FEELING: that touch of human
ity, the closeness of which stories must reveal.
One must imagine and enter oneself in the part of the
individuals whom one is attempting to create; not gaze
upon them from a far off and cold perspective, but
CHANGE PLACES WITH THEM, breathe their breath,
sing their songs, and shout their triumphs, or feel their
sorrows to the heart's core so that they may be spilled in
drops of blood of anguish.
The REALITY of any subject means LIVING THE
REALITY of that subject! To know and verify the
truth of the material issues and passions.—Mortality must
live in the Realities, be a part of Human Interest as a
whole, and Feel the Heartache of another as though it
were your own.
And be interested in human contact whereby something
may be left behind as a beautiful memory of that person
with whom you are in contact. The personal factor of
God in Humanity is only manifested through their moods,
passions and feelings—these constituting their SPIRIT
UAL POWER.
Thus the Cultivation of LOVE FOR OTHERS gives
the individual a finer sense of knowing GOD AS HE IS.
And without this Spark of "Love-interest" toward your
fellowmen, the world of outward nature—depicted in the
glory of its magnificence—would not suffice to fill the Soul
with that SOMETHING which Interest in Humanity
Satisfies !

respond to such as these in like manner.
Thus it pays to cultivate SPIRITUAL HUMAN KIN
SHIP, so that one may always MANIFEST THE GOD
AS HE IS. Lofty well considered thought NEVER GOES
ASTRAY, and creates happiness that is lasting; not only
for a day, and it wafts itself away STEADILY to heaven

I used to believe that my life was being wasted because
of the small area in which I circulated and lived and

those who became celebrated in the past. They had none
of the commodities for moving about. A narrow wooded
pathway was most all they could follow.
Railways were scarce; and in the little English village
where I resided for many years, about the greatest excite
ment that ever occurred, when I was of the impression
able age, was the VISIT OF THE BISHOP, who came
once a year. To me he seemed an angel straight from
heaven. Once I made all at the dinner table titter when
I asked him how all the people were up in heaven.
It was such an event to have a stranger come into our
midst, that it seemed as if they must have come down
from this glorious domain, which I so fantastically
dreamed of in my childhood.
Ah! If you could have seen the bishop! Queer look

Long, wool, homespun socks, brought up over a pair of

black parchment with a great brass buckle on the side.
I speak of his face last—a wrinkled brow —gracious
eyes behind large spectacles —a prominent hooked nose
and a mouth with merry smile. And how he loved young
people: giving them merry cheer and hope, and telling
them all the happenings of what seemed to us a detached
world: yet it was only about FIFTY MILES away from
whence he came.
Merry-making and prayer intermingled. Dinners were
given in honor of the bishop's visit; and at these dinners
we received all the news of our seeming "outside world"
from his lips. The things which he had heard and ex

Could a life have been more narrow —and yet so full?
And to-day your writers find so many adventures that
none of them seem important! So the individual of to-day
skims all the milk of life because the issues of passing
surroundings are tremendously large, and all minor hap
penings have become commonplace.
Thus the grandeur of life is built upon fact and not so
much as through the fancy and imaginative channels of
"Ye Olden Days." But the writers of old bear a richness
of the pen that the writers of your day may not have,
for their writing seems material and more along journalis
tic lines.
Man is using the skim milk and loses the uppermost
cream; dwelling in facts and leaving the depths to spoil.
And the same may be said regarding man's creative ideals
concerning God—TO WHOM HE IS ACCOUNTABLE
THROUGHOUT ALL LIFE FOR EVERYTHING.

himself the Highest Possible Conception of the DIVINE
SUPREME FORCE OF LIFE.
Returning to the fundamental principle of the potency
of God, this shall not be acknowledged as a truth until
SPIRITUALITY IS UNIVERSALLY ADOPTED and
PRACTICED in the life of each and every individual.
PRINCIPLE!—not SPIRITUALITY— under the
sense of doctrine and creed of Ye Old superstitions and
ideals that existed in my day and time—but in the manner
of a practical, sensible, well-balanced order of thought of
this day and time.
Psychology should be a life-long study as an accom
plishment being a part of the development of the human
race; not scientifically alone, but as a part of the Godly-
curriculum! There is a vast difference in the teaching of
Psychology as understood and practiced only along scien
tific lines, where GOD IS LEFT OUT as an unimportant
factor, as to the formulation and practice of this new Psy
chology of Christian living of to-day.
SUCCESSFUL PSYCHOLOGY MUST HAVE A
CHRISTIAN BACKGROUND: otherwise it is a danger

it,

of Uplifting Man and Christian Work, wherein God is
Magnified, there it is directed in its proper channel.
It was considered to be a sin in my time if a man pro
vided his home with a spinet, or first period piano. To
our small world he appeared to show an undue liking for
earthly things.
Now this is where PSYCHOLOGY has applied its part
DIRECTLY FROM GOD, for man has learned, that
MUSIC SPIRITUALIZES THE HOME!
And would it not be well to put into the human mind
this fact, that EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN HELP in
SPIRITUALIZING THE HOME! There are various
ways for this Accomplishment —various Mannerisms of
Refinement. The home is the Heart, or the Soul-center
for humanity. IT IS WHERE LIFE BEGINS, and
WHERE LIFE ENDS, in the physical sense, and the
Standardizing of the SPIRITUAL CREATIONS in that
Home, SYMBOLIZES DEITY, According to the
Thoughts which Create the Atmosphere surrounding the
loved ones in every home.
The pleasant, happy greeting; the good book; a prayer
sanctifying its walls; a song; an easy divan; a fireside,
bright, clean and inviting; a hob and its kettle steaming;
birds and music; art and pictures, which waft the imag
ination away and onward into a day dream of reality!
The finer that the senses of the master of the house are,
the Higher will be their Culmination in the Home, and the
Higher their IDEAL OF GOD'S PLAN.
Morning and evening worship have seemingly passed
away in the home shrine because of all the new creations
which have come to surplant it. Yet this neglect is not
to say that Christianity is fading. It, too, has simply
started on a newer and higher life and broader outlook.

noblement of mind has builded to further perfect the

surroundings. Perhaps it would be a benefit to my read
ers to suggest, that the ART OF REAL READING

A home of Refinement, no matter how beautiful, is eas

waste paper basket. The master of the home must place
a censorship upon the low, vulgar, and worse, class of
writings, that its Psychology be not Undermined to FUL

WOULD NOT WASTE ONE IDLE MOMENT in Non
essential, Useless, or Worse, Saturnalia.
Man would, at every opportunity, sip the "richness of
the cup of grace" which nature puts within man's reach
with the daily turn of the sun.
Ah! Had I but had access to the beautiful libraries
which civilizations now have the advantage of—PRIDE
AND PREJUDICE might have had more color. Nowa
days man has only to apply himself to make a heaven any
where on earth. Remember that THINKING IS BUT
USING GOD-POWER!
But to read an article, only to find the plot and its
closing climax, is NOT TO READ AT ALL! One must
LIVE imaginatively right in the bodies of its characters
in whom one is interested. A finer sense of apprecia
tion is discovered in the "art of reading," through placing
one's SELF as A PART-ACTOR within a book.
If this letter of mine conveys no other lesson, than to
teach the reader, that the WORLD OF LITERATURE
CULTIVATES THE SOUL OF MAN! and he, who but
skims the surface, only scratches the surface of its "soil of
productivity,"—its sustaining power remains undisturbed
and unabsorbed.
Underneath —in the heart of that World —the SPIR
ITUAL THOUGHT FEEDS THE PLANT OF LIFE.
READING IS A SERIOUS BUSINESS GATHERING
ALL OF ITS BEAUTIFUL FRUIT.
I note that the youth of to-day are taught in their
schools to VISUALIZE A WHOLE PAGE OF A BOOK
AT A GLANCE, just as they might casually scan a great
picture. Thus all its VALUABLE DETAIL leaves no
Impression, because only its Skeleton was seen, and the
Factors which made the OUTLINE BEAUTIFUL are
all lost.

And thus all the Spiritual Food, or Value of a Book is
Lost, and man grows out of his youth without being con
scious of the VALUE OF DETAIL ! He naturally lacks
completeness, system and order, and does not know what
is wrong with him. And this is a Failing instilled into him
for all time.
To be a reader of detail is to glean the capacity of a
genius of detail—WHEREIN GOD-REFINEMENT IS
MAGNIFIED, and which Characteristic is absolutely
essential for a successful life. One's Ability in many lines
and one's Interest in Humanity denote one's Valuable
Characteristics.
Life should not consist of years of painstaking toil to
earn a reward in heaven and upbuild a vision of the face
of a God afar off. And, thank God, this is almost a past
and gone record of man's lack of development in practi
cability and common sense.
Nowadays the ordinary common sense teaches the in
dividual that GOD IS PRESENT and is working hand
in hand with him wherever he
is,
trying to guide him, and
asking him to HELP HIM in return, that He
is
EVERY
WHERE, VIBRATING THROUGH NATURE, and IN

Also that HEAVEN
is
A STATE OF MIND! which no

CHOOSES TO DO SO— and Refuses to EXPRESS
GOD'S WAY.

you know that it was more than ten years that my child

to this way of communication, and it is difficult at the
start. But I am greatly pleased with the marvelous suc
cess of the writers of these letters, especially when it is so
difficult to complete a contact.
We pray that these books may be an emancipator from
the untrue illusions which prevail upon the subject of
SPIRITUALITY in earth minds, for it is nothing mys
terious and there is nothing to fear. It is just Natural
Law and a very real part of human life. I am greatly
interested in the future of these publications, and it is
indeed a privilege to enter in and be one with the throng
which are bringing forth these great principles.
I am only one eternal pilgrim. One is born to be thus,
a mental and physical helper to the God-mind which never
ceases to lay new highways and byways for the beautiful
principles of everlasting life. We who are gone on be
fore, are but paving the way for those who follow, making
eternal life more and more beautiful and comprehensive
to Humanity.
We acquire our superior knowledge through our expe
riences in the great book of life, which may also be your
daily occupation. Our daily Inspiration is instilled into
those "strong for Uplift and Good," and many feel and
acknowledge our close proximity and inevitable force!
Thus I greet the world and delight that at last human
leadership of thinking people seems to be peering out
into sublime plans for the welfare of mankind far into
the future. Readers of the fiery press and other pub
lications perhaps feel that the world is hanging on a
precipice, and that the world powers seem at this time
to be mostly Satanic and in strenuous competition with
GOOD.

of GOOD THOUGHT— that which remains undisturbed
by Satanic stirrings —none would fear for the nations!
Despite the vicious propaganda, so freely placed before
man's eyes, which would be the spoiler of God's graces,
the Commonwealths preserve a satisfactory mental bal
ance.
But the world is now passing through an age of unrest,
or a sort of discipline and adjustment which will eventu
ally come to a favorable conclusion. RIGHT IS
MIGHT!—NOT THE REVERSE!— as many try to
force the law of God against Him; but He remains al
ways the GREAT EMANCIPATOR OF TRUTH; and
WE—as HIS UNSEEN SPIRITUAL HOSTS— inter
mingle with the nations of earth, and do much toward
working out ways and plans, by which men may escape
detrimental unbalanced ideals of overlords and pompous
fanatics, or the self-appointed commandants of His chil
dren.
Remember, beloved, that far Greater Minds exist in
unseen spheres, which have power to mediate seemingly
unconquerable conditions such as now prevail; because
they have learned solutions through former experiences;
and this one God-trend is the only successful way for
ultimate correction. Thus these learned Invisible Forces
are paving a pathway of truthful trends with the pen or
hands of clean and renowned writers of earth—by In
spiration !
There is a mass mind, ignorant and thoughtless, that
takes everything that is revealed to them, especially evil,
as gospel; and this gullibility causes much harmful emo
tion by spreading the Panic of Fanatics. This calamity
we are endeavoring to overcome through putting forth
a status of sane, intelligent, true and simple God-princi
ples, by which the Creator adjusts all predicaments at
tributable to man!

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 321
Very soon, we hope, humanity will be sufficiently in
telligent to know, that it is the greatest mistake of all
time, to put faith in one man's dangerous self-opinion:
for this false propaganda is the cancerous Satanic force
which interweaves itself with all good life. If the public
press would graphically depict the "good deeds of earth"
it would save youth from their flouted degradations, and
humanity would soon became a solid unit for good works
and an example of God-rule and government.
Whatever man may bring upon himself and the world,
it is the plan of the Creator to bring Good from that Evil,
and tragic experiences arising from crime should lead to
REFORMATION, and humanity must be brought to
understand this. If God were known to walk among
stratas of men of low and sordid minds, and announced
his ideals to them, they would still persist in walking
their own path to Satan's realm.
And thus they create the birthmark for their future
generations! One generation is but a pathfinder for the
next one and prescribes its destined way. However, the
creator does not allow this degree of life to bring total
destruction. God is but a spirit, and He may work only
by Inspiration; but gradually, yet permanently, he brings
about lasting and eternal Beauty.
Generations go through their struggles, and die to
bring more truth to earth, thus slowly bringing Fulfilment
and Fruition, which is the greatest effort of Mother Na
ture. Perhaps life is a seemingly sad and tragic neces
sity as men misunderstand
it;
but
it
is
a
semester to
befit him for the next step of life to come.
If humanity understood how easily they might limit
the Successes of Evil through cultivating their minds and
characters to rule them, and would decide to depend
entirely upon the SPIRITUAL REALITIES OF LIFE,
which are the CONSCIENCE and the SMALL INNER

VOICE—rather than upon MATERIALITY which now
guides them and breaks down their Morale—sin and evil
would flee on the wings of space.
We as spirit hosts for GOOD never tire however of per
meating the minds of men. We consistently endeavor to
implant in their souls a great desire for better and better
thought, so to delineate all principles in a clean and in
telligent manner; and this is the field which must be en
larged upon, that, "His will be done on earth as it is in
heaven."
Man must understand that a part of heaven is being
lived upon earth, and he has only to count his blessings to
rise above his assumed miseries. This is so plain to me
now that I have encountered so many experiences since
leaving the land of my birth on the marvelous vessel, the
"Titanic." I left with great enthusiasm in earthly inter
ests, though I had a distinct premonition of danger. I
had been surrounded by friends for three days previously.
Had I at any time gone into the Silence and Listened to
my Inner Guidance, I would have understood.
When I stepped upon the gangplank a cold shudder
penetrated my entire body, but I cast away the feeling,
believing that it was sorrow at leaving my loved ones.
When the time of calamity came I held the thought that
I would be saved. The captain worked with every nerve
taut, very heroic in his courage and ability, and taking
the women and children first, naturally left behind the
men who were able to assist others.
A calm thought came to me that I had a great work to
do in any event, and it mattered little what happened.
I had a distinct feeling of quietude and could aid others,
which I did. But suddenly a great wave submerged the
deck and I was carried away, and down. I seemed to
feel little emotion except that of being carried down
through a rush of waters which deafened me : then all was

coma, and I do not know how long I remained in this
condition.
Apparently I came to myself again, and felt that I was
still in my body. I felt natural and comfortable and
could see the vessel. I saw bodies about me, some seemed
to be dead and quiet, and others struggling. Some were
moaning; some hysterical. Some realized the terror of
the situation but knew not the conditions.
I seemed to watch this entire situation for some time;
then I began to recognize many people whom I knew had
passed on to Eternity, relatives and friends came to me.
I saw these Spirit Entities rescuing others and guiding
them away. Then I saw a great bright light, a golden
glow; and I seemed to realize that it was a vision of all-
happiness, a feeling more thrilling than anything I had
ever experienced in earth life!
But, remember, I did not know that I was "dead"! I
believed it to be a vision. Then I heard someone tell
another that he had met death in shipwreck and that this
was indeed his experience with "death." But that we
"were not dead," just simply leaving the earth realm and
our bodies that were of no further use. We were simply
pilgrims going onward in a natural way of life.
Strangely then I felt cold and uncomfortable, though
my body responded to no thought; and then I watched
myself step forth from that chrysalis and saw it lying
lifeless and disinterested as I soared away and left it be
hind. My whole thought was then, "I am going home,"
and thought I saw a way of escape. As I kept going, I
was seized with a desire to return and see my folks at
home, and I actually talked this over with others who
were leaving that terrible spot.
But no one dictated or advised, and while concentrat

grief stricken. I read newspaper headlines there and
then only did the whole vast truth penetrate my reason.
I so sought to make myself seen and heard and I put my
arms about my own, but there was no response. They
were submerged in grief and thought me lying at the
bottom of the Atlantic.
I fully realized what a farce this was against the truth!
As for myself I never felt better in my life, and there I
was right with them. It was many days before I entered
into my rightful condition or plane, because I was so in
terested in them and my friends, and I remained with
them, endeavoring to console them, until the first shock of
the disaster had worn away.
You will smile when I say, that soon I began to help in
my office, taking up my usual work as if I had never
left. I sat sifting out facts and endeavoring to inspire
those who were editing and proof reading and planning
future editions of my Review. But the time came when
I became more interested in conditions on the "other
side," for I found it a garden of complete rest and fas
cinating adjustments.
I saw countless souls passing through various phases
of spiritual interest to Humanity. Heaven is a place
where a man sees everything he ever did pass and repass
before his eyes. It is just as a kaleidoscope, and right
here it is where the Material and the Spiritual Consciences
come into the true Understanding of their lives—past,
present and future. It is where they learn direction.
Here I found great opportunity for consoling people,
even strangers. It seemed as though I remained at this
place for some time, and as yet knew not my future
ordination in God's work, which all learn in time. But I
was extremely happy there for I could console people
of heaven and of earth. I felt no grief and was willing to

This Intuition springs up at this time more vividly than
any other of earth or heaven at any time. It is seemingly
a POWER which presses all forward into larger and
larger fields of experiences. It was as if an Eternal Force

I went, and I may describe the place I visited as a great

about this garden, and for some reason, a greater and
wider truth about life permeated me; a "rational view of
things" which I had never perceived before.
When one wanders through this field of beauty, it seems
that all the finer capacities of the Soul rise uppermost.
I seemed to realize the magnitude of the God-power of
the COSMOS —as if I had been careless of this thought
heretofore. All the old and material precepts fade away
and one is brought forth a new person. A seemingly
inexplicable power lifts one into contact with new phases
of thought-principles which had never before seemed so
interesting.
For many days a Spirit visits this realm and learns to
disregard and leave behind all details of worldly affairs;
and I found later, that this is done, so that the Spirit sees
no vision of the disposal of the shell of the body left on
earth. It is entirely oblivious to this fact.
I had read often that the Spirit does not leave the body
until it disintegrates, but this is not true. An Inevitable
Power sends the SPIRITUAL BODY into other climes
soon after the dissolution, which closes out from view
all disagreeable, unhappy scenes.
Some critics ask if a spirit returns to earth, why does it
not see strife and sorrow? Because this fact would seem
an abortion to God's plans for perfect happiness. The ma
terial realities, however, which the body suffers are not
made apparent to its "spiritual body." When a spirit
visits the earth, it contacts only the "spiritual body" of
an individual, and knows only normal truth and beauty.
This explains also why humanity do not more clearly
feel our contact. We do not even see organic conditions
unless for some special reason. We see only the VI
BRATING FORCE OF NATURE, which pulsates as
one force through us and all Nature. Our thoughts do
not penetrate material principles unless we want to, for

However if we wish to correct ills, we "do see other
wise." We then see the agonized faces of earth—yet
these have little affliction for us, because we know, that
most material ills are superficial and transient. But none
must believe, that in any way they bar away their loved
ones— for SPIRIT IS VIBRATION which Penetrates
everything.
SPIRIT IS INSTANTANEOUS, for it is a PART OF
GOD, or the UNIVERSAL MIND, and GOD IS
EVERYWHERE AT THE SAME TIME. We, the so-
called dead, ARE REALLY DICTATORS TO THE
LIVING! When once a spirit entity becomes recog
nized by the SPIRITUAL BODY, living in temporal
man, it is the CONTROL FOR GOOD of that bodily
force as far as its future destination is concerned.
It is only when a spiritual entity fails to gain control of
a material body, that this is a proof of a wrongful spirit
being evident therein. Hence we naturally beseech every
one gifted with the pen to become etherealized in action,
word and deed, and to rise above the scum of physical
realities which appear to many to be of ultra importance.
The outer body of man is but a Coating for his SOUL.
The real endeavor of all life should be the Development
of that SOUL or the INNER MAN in cause and effect,
not the outer mummy case ! And if parents would but in
stil this truth in the impressionable minds of their chil
dren they would not limit the theme of their earthly lives.
There is no thought of wars in the Higher Planes —no
Contentions —no Bigotry—no Hates, Covetousness, Mal
ice or Jealousies! There
is,
as has been stated,
a
first
plane very close to your own, where narrow minds must
remain for correction. It
is
more related to earth than
to heavenly conditions, for its inhabitants must overcome

malformations of mind, and shape them properly, to en
able them to dwell in the Clime called Paradise. This is
a Spiritual Test-sphere for the spirit after leaving earth,
which the Roman Catholic calls Purgatory.
Unless one has a clean mind and fine concepts, the
Spirit enters this realm and remains there until it is edu
cated and clarified. It contains souls which have been
kept in ignorance and superstition by church or state,
and in poverty through which they do not know good
from evil. Here they must learn how to become meek,
sane and rational.
Here they review constantly all evils done by them!
It is a place where all the panorama of earth life passes
continually in review, in all its glaring colors, constantly
before the conscience. This is a mode of correctional
justice and brings retribution to the evil-doer. It is very,
very real, and until one comes to the realization of one's
wrong-doings, and concludes to sorrow and repent them,
this picture does not pass away!
Some remain in this torment for they are too evil to do
aught else. They have so distorted their souls on earth
that seemingly they cannot change; and this class of
spiritual souls are horrible to look upon. They hover
about the earth and intermingle with the evil demons
thereon. I have not commingled with them, but passed
them by and had a glimpse of their tortures.
When a Spirit comes to earth the trip is instantaneous,
and one sees little on the way. We follow a ray of light,
and a force of nature closes out outer conditions from us.
I call this "intentness of thought." This same rule may
easily be enacted in material life by deciding to concen
trate on one thought, and thus one may enact any deed
SPIRITUALLY.
This is the best form of Concentration and is the same
trend in which the Spirit operates ! We Concentrate ab

solutely on what we are doing, and our minds are thus
not distracted by outward things. We just think of our
MAIN MISSION, and this ability improves as one tends
toward the higher climes.
I got away from my subject, for I wished to tell you,
that after I experienced a time in Paradise, I went on my
way. I do not seem to recall just what happened between
the times when I found myself in different spheres, only
that it was like "visiting foreign climes." I was welcomed
by my loved ones, and finally entered an exact duplicate
of my home on earth.
All the things I loved and that were necessary were
duplicated in this place, and immediately I knew, that I
had passed through my correction and had received my
ordination, to use these materials which I had loved, in
my chosen field of labor. Hence I engaged myself busily
at once.
In this plane, where I am now located, life is just as
natural in contour as any life on earth. We have the
ESSENCES of all MATERIAL THINGS for use and
comfort, and the SPIRITUAL BODY pursues its own
natural industrial trend which follows vague beginnings.
Each Spirit follows its own course and has its individual
experiences and its own fixed relationships.
The physical body is limited and cramped but it has
passed through its fixed cycle of expression, and is through
with its work. The Spiritual Body simply goes on, and
there is nothing whatever uncanny about it. All is simple
and natural law. I feel just as I did in life, and still fol
low my chosen vocation. But I have only to think a
thought and it is enacted in the wink of an eye; and all
humanity will eventually develop this power of their ego.

premacy along many lines which man a decade ago did
not experience. Man is entering a HIGHER VELOCITY
OF VIBRATION; he is becoming more and more Super
sensitive and is grasping many unseen forces which in
another decade will seem to him only natural.
Thus man is learning to emanate his mind with IN
CREASED VELOCITY OF VIBRATION, which "com
prises a higher element"; and he is learning to direct this
instantaneously —even to persons thousands of miles
away. In time man's Spiritual Body within him will be
able to visualize persons and places at a great distance
and bring back a full description.
The more Experiences one has had the older one is in
SOUL-GROWTH and the Greater in Wisdom. This is
also but natural law, and to us it is nothing mysterious.
A person may be seated quietly, and exclaim, "Oh, I see
such and such an incident in France," and describe the
scene enacted with its environment: and this is only a
natural trend of human ability, which shall be accom
plished just as has been the marvel of the radio.
Other planets have accomplished this fact and send
their spiritual minds forth, bringing back true pictures
that they have contacted on neighboring planets. This
is only a natural dynamic force such as rules radio waves.
Gifted people will more and more read the minds of other
souls, and this is but another gift of ever-budding God-
wisdom.
With these new gifts available, man will more and
more despise the low material greeds and attractions of
war and bloodshed and old-embedded hates, for he will
see that they but react evilly upon himself in punishment
and torture. Mankind are simply unfolding into God-
law and learning their SPIRITUAL POSSIBILITIES
and becoming worthy workers for the Creator rather than

may I state that I am one of the "great committee"
chosen to unfold more and more truth regarding

COMPREHENDED AS THE ABSOLUTE BASIS OF
ALL RELIGIONS! ITS SOURCE IS VIBRATION,

As a leader of this thought, I am still magnifying its

put forth any communication until the world may better
understand it. The negative forces against the truth are

332 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
First may I greet the world in which I was so happily
associated, especially the collegiates of various places of
learning, Bucknell, Johns Hopkins, Smith's, Columbia
and various others which were a part of my life work
amongst growing ideals of youth.
Do you know I feel highly complimented when I trace
various graduates and read their minds, to see the out
come of thought and action from their learning, and the
great endeavors they are exemplifying to express life on
earth. And there are no students of old who do not re
ceive my earnest inspiration to this day, just as in the
past. When a friendship is formed upon earth, it liveth
forever. Interesting, is it not?
I am as much as ever, in this "world of spiritual re
nown," setting forth the ethics of science especially along
Psychological Lines, which men in your world of thought
are to-day putting into practical uses. I have been in this
larger field of existence but a short time, yet years to us
seem as the wink of an eye, so great is our interest in our
work; and time is vast and expansionless.
Therefore it is difficult for us to judge life as lived in
the puny experience of say, James Hyslop, on earth,
when one afterwards is destined to experience life through
endless eons of progressive learning in the VAST UN
KNOWN: a career which the spirit mind could in no way
convey to the human mind just Entering Spiritual Growth.
Here in Eternity we find Mind to be more full of prom
ise each day as we pass along; in fact the days are as
naught to us for they are so filled with interest, knowledge
and learning. And the greatest Theme in the minds of
the many, many beings in Eternity—at least those instru
mental in taking the lead in universal development of
mind on your earth plane—is—an intense motive and
determination to bring Psychic Research out of its hiding

TICAL REALITY!
We wish every SOUL to fully understand that it is a
UNIT OF GOD OR UNIVERSAL MIND! Then all
may know, that to neglect the PSYCHICAL ISSUE OF
PRINCIPLES UPON EARTH, forces one to make up
this knowledge in Eternity, before one may progress in
learning —so we ask mankind —"Why put off until to
morrow what should be done to-day?"
"Open ye the gates," quoth Isaiah, "that the righteous
practical truths of Jehovah may enter inside." The
"righteous nations" of life are the thinkers, and knowers
of real truths; and they are CRUSADERS OF GOOD,
no matter what the form of their government on earth or
the intent of their purposes.
The scientific masters of Spiritual Unfoldment work
audibly through every Principle of Good, and we con
sider each step as so much gained toward delivering man
from Crass Ignorance regarding LIFE HERE AND
HEREAFTER. No man living under God's permission
has any right to pretend to debar any individual from
progressing along his intuitional lines of spiritual freedom
and unfoldment. This is man's direct heritage from God
Himself; and it is no fallacious privilege of any one or all
to debar this Progress through any fad of education in
ethics or science.
And Science has much to do with the Knowledge of
FUTURE LIFE, which I am now depicting. But no
matter how Humanity may endeavor to retard the Spirit
ual Power of God along true "vibrative lines," they will
no more succeed than they would in an endeavor to deflect
the sun from his course.

ARE INDOMITABLE NATURAL LAW! And mental

which is the great EGO OF ALL UNIVERSAL FORCE.
No man must believe, that he is a Newcomer in the
Spiritual Preeminence of life: for every individual is a
Spirit in the growing.
Some humans are many paces ahead of others in mental
divination, through which they have gained a much finer
perception of the vital questions of life. Others are just
coming into the light of this day, and they have to make
an effort to understand the Beauty of "life emanation" all
about them.
Life in itself is purely an UNFOLDMENT OF NATU
RAL LAW! Life is not something to be loosely endured
and immorally guided by ignorant men; and this is the
first principle men have to learn upon entering the
"higher life" of Spiritual Research.
All Life is planned by Deity to be based upon a FOUN
DATION OF SPIRITUAL RESEARCH, WHEREIN
IS THE KEY TO SPIRITUALITY; but ETERNITY
IS THE LIFE OF SPIRITUAL UNFOLDMENT
WHICH THIS KEY OPENS UP! This is not keenly
understood by man while living his temporal span of a
continuous and universal cycle. But it is most essential
for him to unfold new channels of spiritual development.
This is a fixed scheme of natural law, but is set aside
by mankind on earth! and many attempt to do so even
after entering the Elysian fields of Eternity. So the man
who gains even one iota of God's divine promise through
his natural spiritual unfoldment on the earth plane is
wonderfully blessed, for he escapes many pangs and pains
brought about through his Psychical Sloth when he enters
the New Life.
In fact, I know of no more keen suffering and disap
pointment than I have witnessed, when mortals enter the

Higher Strata of SPIRITUAL ETHICS, and thrown
them carelessly aside; for this was the one great Practical
Reality they needed to befit themselves for this sphere.
When a Spirit enters into this life with a materialistic
mind with which to find its way, it is obliged to enter the
"classes of spiritual ethics" in a first sphere, after leaving
the so-called temple of flesh and blood. The few who
escape this course of Inspiration or Instruction already
have a Relation of earth principles to true God-ethics.
They studied and comprehended them while in temporal
form.
The Malformed Misconstruing Minds along the lines of
Materialistic Domination, do not at all fit in with the
purposes of the God-realm; and it is my Ordination to
aid these mortals to find their true Spiritual Understand
ing of the NEW PSYCHICAL FORMS OF LIFE.
There are two direct mind principles which enter the
minds of humans through this change called "death";
the first expound persistently the outer thought of ma
terial possessions, which to them seems to be the whole
of existence. Another aspect is formed in the minds of
others through ancient traditions of ye olden doctrines
which are void of practical Spiritual Psychology, and this
is most Unfortunate, for the STATE OF MIND is the
WHOLE ISSUE OF ALL SPIRITUAL LIFE.
Thus it is my duty to console such individuals and
teach them the difference between the Thoughts they
bring over, and the Truth to which they must adapt them
selves. This duty may not sound difficult. One would
think all that was to be done was to tell them how to
progress. But not so! When once a mind is Constituted
in Narrowness it has to grow, like the roots of a tree,
penetrating deeper and deeper into the TRUTH.
And so deeply are many earthly minds mired in ma

effort to uproot them. It sometimes takes decades to
rebuild their misapplied minds and perceptions, so that
they may eventually find themselves fitted to live in the
God-realm.
Though my time in this plane of direction is some
what long, I myself am still unprepared to progress to
where others have diligently earned a place. But I Per
sist with Profound Sincerity, knowing, that the Creator
of all principles worketh well, and that I shall yet reach
that apex of divine promise.
I relate this to humanity that they may discern, that
one does not reach the highest glory of divine unfoldment
quickly. No matter what their degree of mind, Progress
is Slow, Majestic and Deliberate! It is something that
cannot be forced or hastened. One must lay a firm
foundation before one may build a superstructure of
higher and higher wisdom.
In my life I was greatly interested in this "unfoldment
of psychic research." I knew that many, many proofs
of "after life" were withheld from the public in scientific
annals; put on file and lost to view. The great teachers
believing that the masses would not comprehend them
thus hid proofs of God-laws.
Now as we read the minds of men we know many
preferred to have the credit of discoveries given them,
rather than to expose the great inspirational God-law
back of them: but they had satisfactorily proven the
deeper senses and unseen realities of that which they
delved through partly by academic reasoning power.
There are no Scientists who do not hark back to SPIR
ITUAL PHENOMENA behind every discovery! but

tific teachings of basic spiritual principles must be im

as in the Leadership of the churches.
Most of the formative principles of law and order for
the commonwealth are Cold and Crude Materialistic Ideas

Every Governing Principle of Eternity is conducted

Eternity are for Unlimited Mutual GOOD! And man
has only to put these Spiritual Ideals into practice to have

or Undue Extravagance!
And ardently we wish Humanity to analyze and under

by the lack of distribution of money, when hoarded in

overlooking the places that are fertilized, one sees mass
production. So we wonder why people in power of any
sort fertilize only their own gardens and watch from their
windows to see their people starving.
The whole theme of simple Spiritual Government is
fair direction of purpose. And in order to find true
harmony, man must speed SPIRITUALITY faster than
his Material Ideals which hamper Distribution. And this
not through the teachings of the Clergy, but through the
bountiful care bestowed by rulers of Church and State
upon their Supporters. The clergy may then enter and
aid the commonwealth and clarify Spiritual Truths.
A hungry man does not see the invisible God so clearly,
for he has not the moral stamina to conquer his physical
sufferings. The voice of the Clergy is therefore mean
ingless unless its influence is for man's equity of material
supply! Their principle must be to ingrain Thrift and
Peace and Equality, or Religion will be wrongfully ap
plied.
The world may easily arrive at a system spiritually
implanted, rather than by Gross Materialism. And then
Knowledge, coming through the scientific fields, will be
understood and appreciated as contributing to all alike:
nothing great for the few, and unrestricted. All will be
wide open like heaven itself.
The world is given every opportunity by Jehovah to
conquer through Spiritual Truths; for all the Truth of
God is before their eyes. And Science must be more
liberal in establishing a world-wide knowledge of its dis
coveries and truths, for thereby Humanity may easily
accept the SPIRITUAL SYSTEM AS NATURAL
CAUSE AND EFFECT, AND THE BASIS OF ALL
REVERENCE ! They will have no need to accept purely
"manmade Ideas" from any source which are misleading

34Q LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
And Science only may accomplish this, for scientists
possess true facts. Thus Humanity will believe them
when they illustrate their formulas and common sense
factors to Humanity, which will rise above the idealisms
of the world and show that SPIRITUALITY IN VARI
OUS TRENDS IS GOD HIMSELF—DIRECTING
THE WORLD, AND LABORING THROUGHOUT
SPACE FOR HIS CHILDREN.
Scientists could prove, that SCIENTIFIC AND
PSYCHIC REASEARCH is not a fad or fancy, and con
vince Humanity, that they are but Searching for VITAL
TRUTHS and use their influence to bring forth Knowl
edge of the Intuitive Powers of mankind, rather than by
squelching and hiding the SOURCE of INTUITION—
which is all Knowledge of the Spirit.
This is because Science not only is able to prove fact,
but has the aid of the universal press. So it is almost
entirely up to the SCIENTIFIC WORLD to proclaim
what it positively knows of God's great Leadership of
all principles through the Trend of SPIRITUAL
ITY: WHICH IN ITSELF IS EXPANSIONLESS
GROWTH!
There are indeed many forms of SPIRITUALITY, but
all center in the great God-mind. All bear the same back
ground with its true direction in the Teachings of SPIR
ITUALITY though Denounced by the ignorant and self
ish. And this is mostly, because Humanity know not
that SPIRITUALITY IS GOD-LAW, the Basis of every
natural thing—the great Saviour of mankind under God's
grace.

therein one is preparing his Physical Subconscious Mind

SUPERCONSCIOUS MIND fulfill its fixed and proper
plan of life procedure.
And when once the Subconscious Mind of man is edu
cated to think along the higher mental levels of life, his
ego reaches into the God-realm and the world principles
are unfolded before him in their true relationships. The
ego is also relative to your world, for every EGO IS A
GOD-SPARK OF LIFE from the Great Infinite Mind of
creation; and a fixed part of that principle.
How man measures his life in a Spiritual Direction
along the LINES OF TRUTH, is the Degree of his
Treasure which he eventually finds hidden in his CON
SCIENCE, when he appears before Jehovah; and too
late he instantly recognizes how much more valuable he
could have made this mighty gift—had he paid heed to
the ethics of his Spiritual Power !
Man has the whole world of wisdom within himself, and
this alone—when governed by God-knowledge —is his
entire Fount of SALVATION. He need only advance by
listening to his INNER VOICE on Spiritual Lines —and
Reverence and Religion will be built up within him
through this development.
So we cry to Humanity to awaken—especially those
who cling to the ashes of truth —awaken to the sound
of the DIVINE INNER VOICE! Never cease the en

first visit, for we come to accustom ourselves to the Vibra
tions; but I am just as much a part of the Psychological
Thought of earth, as the Material Brain is part of the
process of thinking.
Beloved, do not place a mistaken stress on the picture
which has been drawn of heaven. The golden streets are
just symbolic of your world-degree of thinking and action
as being the line of Unfoldment of the value you place on
God's TRUTH—THE SHINING PATHWAY OF LOVE
AND DUTY IN LIFE.
The "pearly gates" are the Opening of men's Conscious
ness, when Ignorant of the Truth of the FUTURE LIFE.
These gates are opened up by man's own effort in that
direction. Man is no better or worse for coming "over
here" for he brings with him just exactly what he en
deavored to bring —or has produced in his earth life
through his Strata of Thought-direction.
Life is an endless cycle. Heaven is composed of Rein
carnated Souls of all time, working together in the Un
foldment of Moral Truths of Existence. Heaven and
Eternity are a part of the earth clime, and merely a con
tinuance of dwelling in the universal God-realm.
Therefore what one formulates in the earth span of
life is his future plan in the Heavenly Clime —his next
transition. There are no "dead." St. Matthew, among
others, gave this lesson most plainly. It is constantly
surprising to us how Humanity deny and grow away from
"plain spiritual truth," especially, when Jesus, the Great
Master, gave to the world such a perfect keynote to all
life.
This was done so that foolish men might not deny the
immediate rising of the Spiritual Body, or the mind.
Every man of earth is just as much a Spirit, as when he
enters the "newer life"; only his Spirit is incarcerated in
what Paul calls "The Temple of the Soul." But the

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 343
Spirit of man belongs to heaven just as much at one time
as another; and it bides its time to Express its Reflection
of Truth and Beauty.
If the material man of earth distorts this Spirit by
believing along lines of materialism exclusively, his Spirit
brings this sort of mind to Eternity; but man soon finds,
that his Spirit does not fit the higher system of thought
which prevails there. Hence it finds itself useless and
unprepared, and that it must receive correction so to be
fitted for the higher life.
But the man who formulates his Spirit along scientific
progressive lines by a search for beauty and depth every
where he looks, reflects this Beauty of the Spirit wherever
he is and outer grace also, constituting an Ethereal Ema
nation even in temporal life. He is a Christian teacher
along a practical roadway leading to Eternity, and is
Spiritually useful.
Any form of constituted Spirituality which is not prac
tical and applicable to every day detail is of no more use
than any dead dogma or creed which has been perplexing,
misunderstood and hampering to progress. Perhaps one
might say that most of the teachings of Humanity are
not Spiritually Practical; while SPIRITUALITY is a cor
rect Direction for practical action.
Thus the voice or force which aids man "from within
his bosom," is able to master every stumbling block which
arises in his path, and make of every incident of life
something clarified and blessed —man has but to be calm
and listen to its guiding!
Now in closing I wish to give to Humanity this thought
—that the earth is but "one station in man's cycle," and
just as much a part of Heaven as is Eternity. Heaven
begins on earth! God is the Divine Power Directing All
Nature! If man is not satisfied with his Religion, let him

Let him stop, look and listen to the "guiding star within
him," for there he will find the key to all Spiritual Life!
Otherwise his theme of life will be hidden and smothered

he will perceive the voice of Jehovah depicted in every

Life is so expansive ! So majestic! Should the little

Scientists can lead the way by not withholding their truths
from Humanity. They should pay no heed to the per
petual scoffer who would down all Truth of God.
It is entirely up to Humanity to settle the narrow bind
ing issues of religious views as against the Truths of God's
wide realms: to decide between Truth versus Fiction.
They have only to ALLOW TRUTH to be the LEADER
OF LIFE! Fiction is the story of past legends, folk lore
and fairy tales.

the way: not Mercenary Tinseled Ideals which drag Man

perhaps no further introduction is needed on earth, for I
know Harvard speaks for me. This is no self-praise for
I am speaking in an attitude of appreciation to the all-
wise Creator who systemizes and works His will through
His creatures of flesh and blood. He gave me the Ordina
tion to establish a better "curriculum in education," which
is the parent of better realities to come forth in the future.
And this morning it is to me a divine privilege to greet
the world with the utmost regard. I come to visit you by
the means of the FIRST LAW OF LIFE, ON THE
LINES OF VIBRATION, which is God-energy pulsating
through everything; and to help Establish a NEW
WORLD OF WISDOM in which all things are shown to
be Accomplished through MIND EVOLUTION!
This was given me because of my possessing a mind of
normal earthly direction and constructive power; and
thus I was privileged to at least establish one point
thoroughly in the great Universal Mind of earth, and this
was an Improvement to the student bodies.
When once a human establishes a new principle it goes
right on forever. So what matters the fading away of
the man, and his form becoming dim to the eyes of the
world? And it is of this principle I would speak to the
Universities of Education 30 that the wholesome fulfil

Humanity is becoming God-conscious ; Feeling His life-
energy at their right hand; Knowing the Thrill of His
presence about them through the magic of Radionic
VIBRATIONS ! This is the "basis of all expression," and
when the student knows and feels forever conscious of
this energy actively working for his success, both students
and teachers will be lifted many steps higher in their

Principles; and through this relation a new world is being
born to knowledge, and a new economic coordination is
coming into its own!
And thus a new governmental cooperation of nations
shall arise through the unfolding of supernormal rela
tions to life. God walks amongst men in a mysterious
way, Gradually Revealing Life, so that Humanity may
draw a more perfect plan of life in days to come.
O, that I could make my spiritual voice heard; that all
souls awake alertly to the NEW DAY, WHICH IS THE
BEGINNING OF A NEW ROAD TO HOPE AND
HAPPINESS ! Up to this time I may say, comparatively
few have ENCOUNTERED REAL HAPPINESS! for
the reason that the "SOUL SYSTEM OF LIFE" has not
been Sufficiently Demonstrated in Material and Spiritual
realities!
Thus the SOUL SYSTEM OF LIFE arrives from the
Individual Thoughts of Humanity and their Coordina
tion in Honorable Principles, wherein the Minds become
broadened and the Soul-vision enlarged. It may be said
that the leading civilized nations now encourage too much
relaxation that shows too little positive results.
However a NEW BIRTH is about to appear, for the
old regime of direction is not sufficient. There are no
new worlds to conquer, but there is need to investigate
the Foundations of the old one; and the way to conquer
shall be to evolve the system promulgated by the com
monwealths, and to establish more Cooperation.
And this shall extend to governments, for they shall
more and more listen to the SPIRITUAL DIRECTION
by which the GREAT COSMOS IS RUN, rather than the
gross Materiality rampant on the earth's surface. It
shall be a system of LOVE on Earth, GOOD WILL to
all men in the future.

348 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
The squeezing of the commonwealths by religious
hierarchies and crooked politicians has seen its day. God
is in His heavens and sees all although He cannot control
physical actions. But the negative forces which largely
control man on earth, also control and punish him in the
Hereafter, until he is befitted to live in the God-realm.
Thus Money-gods shall not eat the vitals of those of
Humanity who have the lesser privileges. Religious
hoardings and the pork barrel shall be opened up and
used intelligently and justly. Honest production and a
Standardizing of Prices shall prevail, and a center of
capable men shall advise economics efficiently.
A time will come, when men shall leave the University,
perfectly fitted to fill a niche which is planned for them
by destiny. The greatest offense to the ALMIGHTY
GOOD of earth has been, that men are too sophisticated,
and acquire many false premises. They expect to start
at the top, and are not contented to do their certain bit
in the world, if it seems to be unusual or humble. But
more of them shall lean toward the outlined system and
press onward toward the social elevation of life as their
goal.
They shall study to raise the average intelligence of all
individuals throughout the commonwealths. Now-a-days
so little is expounded in the press as to the GOOD done in
the world, and the EVIL is exaggerated and played up
in all ways and imprinted on the tender minds of youth.
This is blamable upon those who seek riches, and causes
unrest in the world; these would instigate a new siege of
bloodshed so that they individually profit. There are
three dynamic voices which to-day are causing the "old
country hatreds" in America, unconsciously to the igno
rant masses therein, and leading them to disrespect the
American form of government.

to buy men and put forth its own vicious and clouded
vision, and a certain percent of the ignorant masses see
dully, this is no reason for heads of governments to be
discouraged. But governmental heads should be qual
ified to put down and curb sensational and vulgar, mis
leading and misdirecting press reports and pictures, and
venomous propaganda, all of which stir the pot of evil
omen.
There are so many fine realities to be divined and
shown rather than these uncouth curses. Could the
laborer, who takes little time for correct analyzation, be
able to rise in the morning and read headlines telling the
truth about those who are also laboring for the world's
uplift and future promise, he would be cheered and re
fined. But as he and his family read of the sordid, evil
and exaggerated mass of crimes, they sneer and grow
base in mind themselves; thus a Worse Citizenry is made
instead of a Better one.
So those back of the press and pictures are much at
fault; and we as SPIRIT GUIDES, seeing all with God,
are constantly convening at Mary's Cross and endeavor
to SPIRITUALLY change this system to one on which
God may gaze and inspire men's Intuition to Listen to
Him, that He direct them instead of the Satanic forces.
Eternity began with the creation, and your earth was
intended to be a heaven as all may see by its incomparable
production, peace and beauty, and perfect system of
natural action. But man makes it a HELL Arbitrarily.
It matters little whether he acquires gilded palaces or
treasures of gold, or whether he be in moderate welfare:
if he is rich in SPIRITUAL HAPPINESS—knowing the
presence of God's hand in his! Through Right Think
ing, he has the proper Mind Direction for Happiness on

so that when youth have completed their specified courses,
they shall not go out and face a hard world of gross
material realities, but a World of Worthwhile SPIRIT
UAL EQUITY, wherein they shall add their unit of
knowledge to the blessings of the whole.
This to you sounds ephemeral for this day and age,
when Satanic forces seem to supersede God's power, but
we are building a general reform in every active dynamic
principle. Certain forces are undermining your govern
ment. They make evil causation, then pay to have it
bruited about as the fault of your government, and the
ignorant accept the belief, that an evil government will
redound to their profit.
But within the next three to five years you will see
a Readjustment and an Exposure of Contemptible Prac
tices now extant. Good will come peaceably without
drastic action, led by those who SPIRITUALLY UN
DERSTAND GOD-LEADERSHIP!
In all principles of earthly management there is always
a Period of NATURAL WORKING LAW, wherein the

its normal sway. Your earth has had a Jazz-period, as

less.
Thus a NEW LIFE SHALL COME, and it will be as
Beautiful as this AFTER LIFE was to me when I reached
the Shores of this World of Wisdom! Nature here hath

able and spiritual people;
2. The Establishment of Cooperation among thinking
people on the Foundation of God-law;
3. The Establishment of absolutely scientific science;
4. The Establishment of a Christian foundation under
all ethics; or Spiritual rule instead of Dogmatic;
5. The Establishment of Republics instead of Mon
archies or Hierarchies;
6. The Establishment of Utilities, lightening labor;
7. The establishment of wide open knowledge among
cooperating governments, founded on the ONE
TRUTH OF GOD-LAW, admitting the Imminence
and watchful eye of Deity and learning to Love
one's neighbor as oneself—also a live and let live
principle founded on the Commandments of the

How long shall man continue to defy God's works?
How I hail the day when WE will be Accepted as Living
and Acting MINDS, acknowledged in earth life as part
of man's Living-system, not something apart, unreal and
unbelievable, separate from man's touch.
I hail the day when the "SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION
OF THE EARTH" shall be known and acknowl
edged ... Sir Conan Doyle was really a great Messiah
of SPIRITUALITY; the NEW TRUTH brought out by
him was a new way of earthly life. His work stirred curi
osity among those who could not comprehend the truth;
however they learned his principle and saw a better way !
Now in the great "mind center of eternity" he is co
operating with the hosts of heaven to bring into flower
his budding work on earth and the reality of God's im
minent glory. How I wish eyes of earth could have seen
the majestic Spiritual Reception given him in our world.
He was much surprised when he saw how little change
there was in his surroundings, and one is gradually ad
justed to take intense interest in the finer and higher
sights and principles. He first found himself at a great
reception hall. Tables were set with flowers and decora
tions such as he might find at the finest places in London.
—This is done to avoid shock at one's entirely new sur
roundings.
Then he was led into an illuminated arena, with the ap
pearance of being diamond studded, and this change did
overwhelm him! The first thing he said was, "This is
indeed heaven." He was met and introduced as a speaker
as he would have been on earth. Smiles and warmth,
welcome and sincerity were everywhere about him. These
are our applause. It is the tingle of appreciation that
thrills one.
There was no sadness about him whatsoever, only the
highest spiritual happiness. He heard tones of musical

instruments such as earth knows not. Thus a welcome
was spoken to him and he responded. His son was there
when he entered the "Hall of Forms," which is a special
banquet room for our spiritual feasts, and acted as master
of ceremonies. Many are doubtful that they are in the
newer life, but Sir Conan Doyle was entirely conscious
of the fact.
He then encountered a union with vivacious souls which
did again almost overwhelm him. Really one cannot
describe these things rationally to the human mind, but
one day you may have the pleasure of being received
thus also. This is a privilege of all who are honestly
working for God. Those who choose to be out of tune
with Him never come as far as this hall of spiritual re
union.
Many come to its outer court, which is rugged and
lonely: they go by a regular system to a silent spot where
they may converse with only their own thoughts, with
not a soul to welcome them. But when they have cleared
their conscience and are repentant, the voice of welcome
comes to them; then an angel of mercy is beside them
and leads them out into the light.
I saw the dark area where souls were suffering the
damnation of damnable sins. They were crying to be
given the LIGHT OF DAY, yet they found it not. There
is nothing imaginable more terrifying to view than these
lost souls alone in their physical concepts of earth. Some
of these unfortunates spend a limited time, others an un
limited period in this state if they will not relinquish
their selfish stubborn motives.
But until they overcome these evils and acknowledge
their SPIRITUAL BODY AS A LEADER, they are for
ever conscious of their wicked physical body and its mis
demeanors . . . And now you see I became so inter

If your eyes were not blinded spiritually, you could
see in imagination a picture of the exhilaration and light
it gave the spirit world to receive so great a Soldier and
Spirit as Conan Doyle! He was glad to enter our midst
and was prepared for his surroundings. He came to
Mary's Cross (a center of spiritual ordinations), and was
presented on the platform where all eyes could see his
face.
It seemed there was a diadem of glory about his head
as if he had long Retained the MESSIAH SPIRIT! His
eyes Glowed with the LOVE he felt. He spoke with a
voice, low and sweet, which only heaven's hosts could in
terpret. He had no changes to experience, for he had so
filled his place on earth, that he is prepared to go right
on in his way of Inspiration and Spiritual Teaching.
It was his method to see God first in everything through
the mind's eye, so we had no difficulty in teaching him
new principles. He came with such a glad heart to meet
his loved ones; and he knows those left behind under

A plan was made that he bring certain communications
to prove his survival. The earth at large, however, is so
spiritually ignorant and scoffing that they cannot find the
key to open the door of the After-life as easily as they
might do. So he finds it more difficult to reach the minds

As for his understanding the laws, or unseen principles
of this life, they are well established in his writings.
I was one of the privileged welcoming committee to
meet him, and we made it very real to him that he might
feel contented. We arranged his reception much as his
desires would have indicated on earth. Even his favorite
flowers and spiritual foods were placed before him ! How
he "loffed" —which is his way of speaking—but it made
him think of "home"! Yet he was vitally interested in
the hundreds of new faces, but he thought more of seek
ing new wisdom and new sights than of his bodily losses.
For three days we took him about and showed him
new scenes; but he felt as if he had visualized them be
fore, for a high soul has the privilege of leaving the body
and visiting other climes. But it must return, for the
cord between body and soul has not been severed. These
visits are a sort of preparation, whereby a person is ethe
really attuned to Spiritual Life when weakened bodily.
I had this experience myself three times before leav
ing my physical body permanently. I remembered cer
tain places and people which were not familiar to me;
but this is merely a law to cause less shock when a person
finally passes over: it is a first quest into the Hereafter.
The so-called phenomena of life are but "natural law,"
and the scientific field of research shall soon make public
a demonstration showing the true SPIRITUAL BODY
OF MAN in a sort of Chatauqua circle. It will be such
that the ignorant or any religious sect cannot dispute
or falsify it.

good to make Earth Life more wholesome and worthwhile,

356 LETTERS FROM ETERNITY
bring about a True Civilization and Establish the Presence
of the True, Imminent, Living God, Vibrating constantly
through all things in a worthwhile kingdom of earth—
seeing and knowing all !
There shall be no more "false ideas of death"; the
Change shall be called "a Christian promise."
Before closing, I should like to say to the Educational
Centers, that a worldwide campaign must be made against
Unjust Misrepresentations in the Unprincipled Publica
tions which are so corroding the day with corruption. A
general housecleaning is imperative. Why should any
thing but uplifting print be immortalized?
When Humanity remain blind, and consent to unclean
propaganda and filthy text, the mind of youth is hope
lessly clouded to the Simple Good of God's plan for them.
If this continues Satan shall more and more continue in
his dastardly work of Misleading Tender Youth.
Will you take my warning, beloved, and see to
it,
that
good books only are put forth as words of wisdom! for
LOVE, the Apparent God-principle, Builds Wisdom; and
in any body, wherein God-principle
is
not Illuminated —
Satan
is
quick to Spy out an Opening wherein to plant
evil seed.
I
have had no regrets since coming "over here," for
I
Understand the Greatness of the "new life" in its Possi
bilities and the Glory of its works!
I
Magnify the Fact,
that
I
am still
a
Unit of the "thinking equilibrium" of
your world and of other worlds in the making, for there
are many such.
Your earth
is
a
tiny insignificant spot compared to
other worlds which
I
have had the privilege of visiting.
The universes of stars are countless! The Spiritual
Minds of all people Evolute On and On! and there must
be Endless Space, System and Arrangements for them.
There
is
a
niche ready for all good souls wherein they

may bring about the Gracious Glory of Spiritual Domin
ion and help to extol God's Universal Truths.
I wish to extend my sincerest greetings to your kindly
lovable friend, Herman Behr. The soul of Goethe is in
deed by his side directing his efforts as well as many other
literary guides. We have a great fondness for him as
acting the part of a loving kindly father to the Great
Truths conveyed in these Letters.
He is also removing the Scorners of God's law and
bringing Him closer to man's right hand, where He ever
walks with His children. Father Behr loves flowers.
Do you know that flowers are living beings and speak
the music of the spheres —in fact all things which God
constructs are more alive and God-like than any physical
being can possibly comprehend.
The greater and higher the Appreciation of God's
Beauties, the more they will mean to the mortal on earth
and in the Hereafter, and the closer he is in touch with
GOD—for HE IS EVERYWHERE! Happiness is also
everywhere, but this entirely depends upon man's Con
ceptions.
Have you any questions to ask before I sign my name?
—O, yes, as to my bringing up in early life. I owe my
success, if any, entirely to a spontaneous energetic mother
and an all-wise learned father, who was a student of
Philosophy. Hence a deep mind was inborn in me, and I
find myself constantly going on living their lives. We are
all one now, expounding our truths for your benefit.
My childhood was very simple and near to nature.
I had no special religious belief, though my people be
lieved in the old adages, but these did not seem real to me!
I saw God Everywhere, Always Beautiful and Perfect,
Entirely Practical Throughout Nature. In my child
ish imagination He was always so Wonderful, and I soon
found, that Man could solve his own problems by Listen

ing to Him, and thus was Led on to Finer Expansions of
Thoughts.
I know now it was God's Directing Voice, and strangely
have kept myself true to that principle. I was also
greatly interested in Chemistry and Mathematics which
were always a tonic to my mind. To Cultivate the Mind
is to Cultivate the Soul! He who stops Thinking stops
Living.
You ask what becomes of arrogant rulers over here?
—They suffer long periods of what one might call the
"damnation of consciousness." There is reformation for
all souls, so even they eventually find their way out, but
they spend whole cycles of life to find their way into the
SPIRITUAL REALMS.
Their SIN IS THE MURDER OF SOULS; and any
detrimental sins committed against others are punished
by the Suffering of the Conscience in the way of Regrets !
An offender has no comfort until he commences to find his
way out of torture. He is confronted by his Wrong
doings, until God is ready to lead him out. If he does
not accept God—the SOURCE OF DIVINE ENERGY
—he suffers alone in conscious darkness and doubts until
he does.
No one can escape this great LAW OF COMPENSA
TION! Otherwise there would be no JUSTICE IN
GOD-LAW. This is entirely fulfilled. A cycle of life
punishment—say it is for murder—is eighty-four years.
It takes that time to clarify a soul and bring it out a per
fect one, the bad being burned away from the good part
of
it,
thus taking away the stain on the brow of the soul.
If man suffers for
a
sin of lighter vein
it
takes an
average of
a
twenty year period for him to lose sight of
the unprincipled acts he has done, and come into Har
mony with the PERFECT VIBRATION OF THE
SPIRIT REALM.

LETTERS FROM ETERNITY 359
A cycle on your side and one on ours are of entirely
different personality lengths in the Evolution of each life.
As a set period, according to nature's mathematical pre
cision, a mortal EVOLVES or is REINCARNATED
SEVEN TIMES ON EARTH. There is no telling how
long each period will be, for that depends on the individ
ual himself—his STATE OF HEALTH— MENTAL
CLARITY and USEFULNESS!
These seven changes are those of the PHYSICAL
BODY and do not pertain to the SPIRITUAL BODY.
The SPIRITUAL one works on the Cycles of twenty
year Periods and the Physical on seven. The SPIRIT
UAL BODY IS ALL MIND, and has nothing pertaining
to the PHYSICAL BODY.
I am weary now. I thank you for your time, and hope
to be felt near you again very soon.
CHARLES W. ELIOT.
