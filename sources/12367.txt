  		              		Experience Description   

  

  I had a major heart attack on Friday the 13th of May 2016. It was the worst kind you can have. I tried to call relatives who were in the house for help.  They thought I was over exaggerating. One of them joked, 'I feel like I'm having a heart attack too!' Since they wouldn't take me seriously, I tried to take a shower. By the time I was done, I knew something was terribly wrong, so I stumbled into my bedroom and called 911. I don't remember getting dressed, talking to the dispatcher, or walking down three flights of concrete steps. When I got to the bottom of the stairs, I was relieved to see I had clothes on.  But I had ripped a fingernail off. The paramedics pulled up as soon as I arrived at the bottom of the stairs. The paramedic calmed me down. I started to go unconscious and the paramedic was asking me what my pain level was.  I tried to answer him and distinctly remember saying 'Seven on a scale of 1 - 10.' He responded, 'OK stay with me.'  I was confused as to why he didn't hear me.  At this point, I knew that I was dying and got very scared. 

 Then BOOM! I was surrounded by a beautiful, white light! I was wondering about my beloved dog Blue who had died just 10 days before this event.  He spoke to me telepathically and in English. It was very comforting to know he was O.K. I than had like a whoosh of sudden information like an instant download of information.  The information was about all my loved ones and so much more that I can't remember it all.

 Than I met my best friend who I had wanted to see for so long. It was Jesus! I just knew it.  Even though he didn't say my name, I didn't ask his either. It was like we always knew each other and he loved me so much! All the information and communication we had was telepathic and instantaneous. I do remember arguing with him at the end, not in a bad way, but saying, 'Please don't send me back there!'  I audibly heard his voice and I'll never forget his real voice. He said, 'No, not yet.' 

 I still cry when I think of this experience.

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Heart attack.       Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function).   I had a widow-maker heart attack. It's the worst one you can have. And only about 10 percent make it to the hospital alive.  
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

The experience included:      Out of body experience  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes.  I heard the paramedic asking me questions.  I tried to answer.  I then heard him say, 'Code 3'  and he also told the driver to, 'Punch it!' All this was going on while I was in the light. Eventually their arguing faded and I could not hear them anymore.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and more alertness than normal.   It was like a hyper-information being download. I felt  joy ,comfort, and LOVE LOVE LOVE! I can't really explain the overload of emotions and information.  
  
  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         I was awake and more alert after I came into the light. Before that I was sleepy from the heart attack and probably on Morphine.  
  
Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     Time did not exist. I coded for 20 minutes in the ambulance.  But my experience felt like it could've been minutes or hours.    
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I saw nothing but white light and felt the presence of God.  
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I didn't hear anything in the light, just at the very end when Jesus said. 'No, not yet.' And I'll always remember his voice.  
  
Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, and the facts have been checked out  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No

The experience included:       Unearthly light  

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

  Did you see an Unearthly light?         Yes   It was like an extremely bright, shoplight that you could stare right into. And you could just feel the comfort coming off of light.  
  
Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         No       

The experience included:       Strong emotional tone  

  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         LOVE LOVE LOVE Jesus loves us so much he wanted me to tell everyone he loves them. And I am 100% sure of that.
  
Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

The experience included:       Special knowledge or purpose  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe.     It was an  instant download of all information at once.  It felt like I already knew the information but was finally able to access it again.  
  
Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It was like floating in a warm, hot spring of love and light  while having access to all information at once and still being at total peace. I felt full connection to everything.

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I do not know how my remembrance of the experience compares to my remembrance of other life events. It is weird that I feel like when I came back, my memory of other events was blanked for some reason.

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     All of us have this gift. 
  
  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The words, 'No, not yet,' spoken by Jesus. The specific word 'yet ' means I get to go home and this fills me with a great joy.  
  
  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I told others but I didn't make my You Tube testimony for 5 or 6 months after my heart attack . My testimony has gone viral more than once on the Internet and I encourage anyone who has a testimony to do it. 
  
  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   Just like the show &quot;Unsolved mysteries&quot; showed clips and things like that. I believed in them but didn't become obsessed with them until after my incident.  
  
  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     Well not only did the paramedic validate my death or code 3 status, but I was apparently dead for about 20 minutes. I also tried to respond to the paramedic's questions but he did not hear me.  This validated to me that I was aware of him, but not in my body.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I have had so much validation from God and other spiritual experiences since my incident. I mean some say your brain was dying it was a hallucination but that doesn't explain the miracles I've witnessed since my experience. Is my brain still hallucinating? They will never know, but God does.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Jesus is funny and he loves dogs. Most Christians don't want to hear that for some reason.  
  
  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         You only asked about Jesus , Buddha , and Muhammad.  You never asked if I had experiences with angelic presences. The answer would have been YES.
