 &nbsp; &nbsp;     Periodical:  The Independent Pulpit</I>      

    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Independent Pulpit, The.
 1885  Weekly, January-May, October-December
 Boston, MA.  Editor: George Chainey.
 1/1, January 10, 1885.

 A series of pamphlets proposed to be issued eight times a year (except for the summer months when Chainey was to attend spiritualist camps).  This was Chainey's response to his conversion to spiritualism.  The first (and perhaps only) issue was "How and Why I became a Spiritualist," in which he recounts his conversion and his meeting with Anna Kimball.  On Chainey, see the notes under The Infidel Pulpit and The Gnostic.
