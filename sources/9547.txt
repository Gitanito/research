  		              		Experience Description   

    My stomach ruptured due to internal pressure. I had gone through surgery, where upper part of stomach is wrapped around an esophagus, and the fundus works as a closing mechanism for a lower esophageal sphincter. This stops stomach acids from rising up to gullet. The fundus was so tight that it prevented everything going up from stomach to gullet, including burbs. I also use a sleep apnea machine and as a side effect, it pumped air into my stomach. Thus, when my rectum got clogged, my stomach and intestines got filled with air. Due the fundus closing-mechanism at my lower esophageal sphincter, the air couldn’t come out via my mouth.  Three weeks earlier I had been in the hospital because of the same kind of clogging. The clog was successfully removed with a naso-gastric tube. 
  
  At the afternoon of April, 21, 2016, I felt how my stomach was getting clogged again. The clog got worse due gasses from digestion.  When the ambulance arrived, I was already in such a bad condition that I couldn’t walk. A fire department’s car arrived.  With the help of its crew, I was carried inside the ambulance. I was taken from my home to the hospital’s emergency room. The initial diagnose was a clog in the intestines. The hospital staff tried to put naso-gastro tube on but failed because the pressure inside of my stomach was too strong.
  
  At this point my memories end and the next part is from the hospital’s records. I was kept in the emergency room from 10 pm to 12:30 am. After that I was taken to MRI, where I had lost my consciousness fully. My heart and breathing had stopped. One scan had been taken. After that, I had been intubated in the MRI-room. Then I had been taken to an operating room  where my stomach had been opened up. Lots of pressure and air had been released from my stomach and after that my condition had gotten better, even my intestines had been bloated from the amount of air. 
  
  At MRI-room, right after intubation, I was given CPR but it had been really difficult. There was so much pressure and air in my stomach that the pumped air in CPR didn’t go all to way to my lungs, which had gotten smaller due the  operation. I was given CPR for 65 minutes and after that, my surgical operation took around 2 hours. After that, my surgical anesthesia was continued while I remained in  an artificial coma and I was placed in the intensive care unit (ICU). 
  
  After waking up, I had a strong sensation of a motherly love that had been given to me. I had never experienced anything like that. I also have a lingering memory of a giant, white circle and how my deceased mother and brother were standing behind it. I couldn’t go on the other side of that circle.

  The next day, my spouse  came to see me and the doctor had told them that they had had  problems with me. After another day,  I was slowly brought back to consciousness around the afternoon. I stayed at ICU until the next day and then I was taken to a regular unit for the next 10 days. After that I got to go back home.

Were you compassionate after your experience?         Greatly compassionate toward others  

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     I’m not in a hurry anymore. Meeting anyone else besides my relatives doesn’t interest me much anymore.  I have hard-time with concentrating on others’ conversations. All useless, not-important matters have dropped off from my life. Only the company where people believe in life after death feels like an important goal for me to meet.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes, somewhat. I’ve noticed that people don’t want to talk about it with me anymore.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of  the experience.   I have long forgotten everything else which happened in the hospital, including names.  But I will always remember that white circle, the loved ones I saw and the love which is known as the energy of the Other World.  
  
Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          I can’t pinpoint an exact time for this. After I woke up, I felt a huge mother’s love radiating inside of me.  
  
  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I talked about this with nurses at the hospital. Only one of them joined my conversation and agreed upon a life continuing after death. Other people, whom I have shared my experience and thought of life continuing after death with, have thought I’m crazy. I won’t tell anyone about my NDE anymore if the environment isn’t suitable for it.  
  
  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   For the most part of my life, I have known that life does continue after death. But how that happened,  wasn’t clear to me prior my experience. I went decades ago to meet medium Svea Richnau.  Back then, I was convinced that the spirit world does exist.  
  
  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     That kind of mother’s love, which I was given by the spirit world that I can’t be or can’t give to others myself. It definitely wasn’t a dream or imagination.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     Same as earlier, I have always believed it to be real.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         If the computer as automatic translation application on, some of the questions change their format. It would be a good addition to mention that people should turn their translation application off before taking this survey in their native language.
