  		              		Experience Description   

    The following is my best recollection of events that occurred while I was undergoing a surgical procedure on December 27, 2017.

  I was placed onto my stomach with my head turned to the right; being prepped for a surgical procedure called an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography).  The procedure is really more exploratory than surgical in nature and involves a camera scope being fed down through the mouth and   stomach, and then into the small intestine to examine and x-ray the bile and pancreatic ducts.  The found that a bile duct had become blocked when several stones had passed from my gallbladder and into the common bile duct.  This blockage was causing problems with my pancreas and liver, which was now only operating at 3% capacity.  This procedure was being performed before the surgery to remove the gallbladder.  As I was positioned onto my stomach, I began to have difficulty breathing.  I told one of the nurses of this. She told the rest of her team that I was beginning to get anxious, and they needed to move the process along faster.  I had already been praying. I continued praying, asking Jesus to be with me through this, and that I was placing myself into His hands, although I knew He was already there with me.  A device was placed into my mouth, holding it fully opened.  Less than a minute later, I again told the nurst that  I couldn’t breathe.  
  
  My next recollection is of being someplace else.  I was no longer lying on my stomach with that uncomfortable device in my mouth.  I don’t have any recollection on whether I was standing, or lying down.  I just know that I was someplace else,  without any pain or discomfort.  There was light all around me.  It was  not especially bright or coming from any one place.  The light  was just everywhere around me. There was no glare, but the light  illuminated everything without shadows.  All around me, I felt a strong, yet calm,  reassuring presence.  Before me, I could see moving text. It looked like  the credits one sees at the end of a movie.  The text was scripture; scrolling upwards and away from me, and moving at a slow, smooth, and continuous pace.  To the left of this scrolling scripture, distinctly separated from the scripture on the right, was an area that was empty, and black.  The area appeared distinct, not only appeared filled with darkness, but also completely void. It was  absent of anything at all.  As the scripture scrolled upwards I could hear, and feel, a voice reading the words aloud.  I also had the feeling, but never heard it read, that all the events of my life had been read and were known.  Through out this reading, I felt no fear, or uncertainty. I felt  a complete sense of calm, as I heard (in my mind), and saw the words passing before me.  I don’t recall all the scripture I saw before me, but I do recall seeing the Gospel of John, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God…”
  
  I awakened in the recovery area to people shouting at me and trying to get me to breathe.  They began to tell me the procedure was aborted shortly after they began due to my going into cardiac and respiratory distress.  This was not a big surprise to me since I kept telling them  that. After a brief period, I was whisked off to get another set of chest x-rays.  I’m not sure why they  needed them, but the team performing the procedure seemed to all be quite flustered.  I felt they were trying to put together a story as to what happened and quickly pass me off to the next guy.  Some of my family in the waiting area said the doctor came in, seemingly uncomfortable, saying they aborted the procedure after my heart and breathing had gone into distress, and I had to be resuscitated.

I don’t recall all the scripture I saw before me, but I do recall seeing the Gospel of John, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God…”

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I felt a greater sense of others' emotions and thoughts.  I felt a greater sense of what may happen in the future based upon my actions and stronger feelings to avoid a choice that will have a negative result, a far greater sense of integrity and righteousness; a stronger conscience, although it was already strong before the experience.
  
  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Yes, God knowing and reading my heart.  He will not be deceived. I already knew that, but feeling Him read and know my heart was intense.  Feeling that He and the Word are one.  The surrounding of light in His presence, and the darkness of His absence to the left of the Word.  
  
Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    The same day I shared it with my family, and shortly thereafter with my friends in ministry.

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     In the coming months, I have found even more reason to accept it happened because there is much scripture that supports what I saw and felt.  I know it happened, and God left a message for me to share with all that will hear.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   I have had dreams in the past of being in the presence of Jesus and being told things that ultimately became true or I found reference to in scripture that I was not aware of before.  

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         God is real and the day will come when I will be judged by His word.  
  
Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Good questions.  I would love to see that statistical results; demographics, etc.  My dissertation for my PhD was on the prevalence of prayer and forgiveness among Christian police officers, and those numbers/demographics were very interesting.
