Having recourse to Astrologers, Fortune-tellers, &c. to get intelligence of Lost or Stolen Goods, or to know the Future Events

HoDY SIRE |
WITH all due Reverence,
Respect, and Admiration, I presume to lay
at your feet, this, my MAIDEN Essay. I have
followed you, at a humble distance, through
the Celestial Fields of Abstruse Learning;
but, as You, SIRE, have carefully gathered up
the “FLow ERs of LITERATURE,” I am com
pelled to be contented with the Blossomed
WEEDs that have fallen in my way.
As the object of my Researches is, like
Yo r's, to promote the Cause of TRUTH,—to
whom can I, with so much Propriety, Dedi
cate it, as to YoURSELF *, And I earnestly
Hope and Trust, that my Endeavours to
Deprive Hypocrisy of her Mask; to Hold
up Villany to Execration; and to teach Cre
(iv )
dulity to distinguish him that is Good, from
him that is Evil,—cannot be Censurable in
the mind of Doctor PARKINs.
Believe me, DREAD CoMMANDER of THE
Host of HEAvEN 1 not your Enemy—though
I should be sorry, very sorry, to subscribe my
self,
In Truth and Sincerity,
YoUR Obedient Servant,
And Very Great Admirer,
THE AUTHOR.

PREFACE.
IN presenting this Pamphlet to the World,
I feel very little of that Diffidence, which, I
am told, is the usual attendant upon Author
ship. The Motive which induces me to write,
may, perhaps, be the Disperser of that Diffi
dence. I believe I have taken up arms in a
Good Cause; and I cannot think of following
the too-comunon practice of Better Writers,
and Offering a Lame and Pitiful Apology.
The Long Reign Doctor Parkins has had
over minds that harbour Superstition and
Credulity, it is time were at an End. The
Press has given such a Circulation to his
Blasphemous Stories and Impious Preten
sions, that by the Press only they can be
Counteracted. And that there are Persons
Foolish enough to Believe in his Power, can
not be better testified than by the Book of
MIRACLEs.
(vi)
------------------, - -
I declare that I have not exposed him from
Motives of Personal or Malicious Hostility.
I have been actuated solely by a Desire to
Place my Countrymen upon their Guard, by
showing them the Character of a Man that
makes a Trade of Imposition.
Who, or WHAT, I am, the World in all
probability will never know. I may be sus
pected as the Author, amongst others: but
there is a Weil thrown over me, like that of
JUNIUs, which few but myself can remove.
I do not conceal myself from a Fear of the
Doctor's Angry Resentment, but for Reasons
I choose Not to Publish. No Embellishment
can be given to Truth by the Printing of a
Name: it recks not whether she approach us
in the Mellow Softness of the Gloaming, or
the Mid-day Glare of the Summer Sun.
If the Public are at all Benefitted by the
Cautions I have given, my Aim will be Ac
complished: if not, though I shall feel sorry
that I have spent so many Unpleasing Hours
in its Compilation in Wain; yet neither my
Interest nor my Tranquillity will be the
least Affected.
(vii)
P. S.–I would have it understood, that
I by no means Recognize this Man as a
Doctor. I have made use of that title, only
because he is known by no other. If he pos
sess a Diploma at all, I suspect it to be one
granted him by Beelzebub 1

REMARKS, &c.
-
“There shall not be found among you any one that useth Divin
ation, or an Observer of Times, er an Enchanter, or a Witch, or a
Charmer, or a Consulter with Familiar Spirits, or a Wizard, or a
Necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination to
the Lord.”—Deut. xviii. 10, 11, 12.
“Regard not them that have Familiar Spirits, neither seek after
Wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.'”
Levit. xix. 31.
THE doctrine of WITCHEs has been observed to be less re
ceived amongst a people who have arrived at some degree of
enlightenment, than with those where refinement and civiliz
ation have made little or no progress. Old hags, wizards,
and magicians, on the one hand; and wise-men, exorcists,
* It is not the intention of the Writer to enter into any controversy,
whether the Witches of Scripture were precisely such characters as
we now understand by the word Witch;—but he would refer the
reader to the following Annotation on the text inserted above:
“Neither seek after Wizards]—FIDEóNIM, the wise or knowing
ones, from yadá, to know or understand; called wizard in Scotland, wise
or cunning man in England; and hence also, the wise woman, the white
witch. Not only all real dealers with familiar spirits, or necromantic
or magical superstitions, are here forbidden; but also all pretenders
to the knowledge of futurity, fortune-tellers, astrologers, &c. &c.—
To attempt to know what God has not thought proper to reveal, is a
sin against his wisdom, providence, and goodness. In mercy, great
mercy, God has hidden the knowledge of futurity from man, and
given him HoPE, the expectation of future good, in its place.”—Dr.
ADAM CILARKE.

fortune-tellers, andastrologers, on the other—were the favour
ites of England in the early ages: so late, indeed, as the
16th and 17th centuries, the cry of Witchcraft, and the trials
of Witches, were common. One HoPKINs, who had taken to
himself the title of Witchfinder-General, travelled through
most parts of the kingdom in search of them. Numbers of
poor wretches lost their lives through his means; and the
whole country, for a long time, was in a state of disorder.
Since then, however, the belief of Witches has been gradually
upon the wane; charms and enchantments have lost their
wonted influence; and the very possibility of witchcraft is
now almost universally denied; or at least received with ex
traordinary circumspection.
Without presuming to circumscribe the power of the Al
mighty, or to assert that his wisdom has not, nor may not,
sometimes permit the Enemy of Mankind to endow his emis
saries upon earth, with extraordinary and supernatural powers;
we may surely regret the circumstance, that, among the lower
classes of the present day, many place implicit faith in the ac
tual existence of such persons now amongst us. Many of our
villages, if we believe the inhabitants of them, have their
Witches and their Wizards, who, by their unholy incantations,
spoil the butter of the dairy-maid, or deal death and destruc
tion among the cattle of the cottager. Some Poor, Feeble,
Elderly Woman, is generally the object pitched upon to bear
the stigma of THE WITCH: if she happen to keep a Black
Cat, and be attended by any Personal Deformity, the cer
tainty of her being such is sufficiently established; and the
poor creature too often suffers Abuse and Personal Injury, in
consequence.
While such is evidently and lamentably the case, we
cannot but view with horror and execration, the Exertions of
a Worthless Adventurer, to blow into flame the slumbering
embers of these Superstitious Notions, in the minds of those,
whose weak uncultivated intellects readily receive whatever is
calculated to astonish and disturb the imagination.-When
ECCE HOMO ! 3
such a man is disseminating through the press, Tale upon
Tale, and Falsehood upon Falsehood, for the avowed purpose
of Filling his Purse at the expense of Public Credulity, it is
high time that some Antidote be attempted, to check the pro
gress of his Impious Publications. And the Writer of this,
though he makes no boast of literary attainment, nor seeks
for literary fame, conceives that he will render a service to his
Country, by an exposure of the Contemptible Bombast, and
Blasphemous Pretensions, of such a character.
Let us, however, examine some of this man's publications,
which, I think, are sufficiently Bombastic and Blasphemous,
to merit these adjectives. In the course of this Examination,
I shall offer such Comments only, as the Context evidently
requires; and to which every one acquainted with the Doctor's
writings, must necessarily subscribe. I have at hand so many
ofhis Pamphlets and Advertisements—all written in the same
strain, and each with paragraphs copied from each—that I
foresee it will be no enviable task, to analyze and arrange such
Complicated Materials. As The Cabinet of Wealth, or the
Temple of Wisdom, however, stands the earliest in date, I
shall with that pamphlet commence my Career ofCriticism.
The Title of this thing is, ofitself, worth a moment's con
sideration. That my Reader may lose none of the Doctor's
Flowers of Literature, and Essence of Divinity, I present it
verbatim.—
“THE CABINET OF WEALTH, or THE TEM
PLE OF WIsDoM ; including Our Celestial Touchstone:
containing a never-failing method to obtain and acquire
Riches, Wisdom, Knowledge, Wealth, Dignities, Honour,
Health, Pleasure, Happiness, and Felicity, both in this
world and also in that which is to come! with other matter,
equally profitable and curious; being a complete Directory
to an Inexhaustible Treasury; beautifully adorned with the
FloweRs of LITERATURE, and the Essence of Divinity.
With a Description of the Happy Man.—By DR. PAR
KINs, Author ofseveral Valuable and Useful Publications.
- Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the
4 ECCE HOMO !
‘Lord's people were prophets, and that the Lord would
“put his spirit upon them !” Num. xi. 29.” &c.
Now let any man consider—for it wants neither Educa
tion nor Ability to consider—how far any one Mortal can
ensure to another, “Happiness and Felicity both in This
World, and also IN THAT WHIcH Is To comE P’ GoD
ALMIGHTY is the only being who can grant us either the one
of these blessings or the other: and I think I need scarcely
dip deeper into the Doctor's Works, than the Title-page of the
first of them, where he arrogates to himself the power of the
Omnipotent, to establish against him the charge of Impiety, if
not of Blasphemy.
The next page of this Book contains an Advertisement,
the first paragraph of which, in the true style of Trade, says
-“All orders will be most gratefully received,” &c. The
next is reprobatory of those who are “taught to despise the
Wonderful Works of God.” [i. e. Those who do not think
proper to believe in Dr. Parkins, as one commissioned from
HEAVEN to Work Miracles.] These, the Doctor informs us,
“are quite ready to despise Heaven, and even God himself.”
And this sentence concludes with a tissue of Texts from Scrip
ture, to give a warranty to, and establish a faith in, the Doctor's
Mission. There is also a reference to a Work called A Dis
sertation on Villany; a work which has never yet seen the
day; and which, in all probability, is not intended to do; or
very likely, of which no more than the Title has been written.
But the Texts of Scripture with which the Doctor crowds his
pages, and grounds the certainty of his Divine Appointment,
are by no means so applicable, as the reader has a right to
expect. I am dealing now in plain sense and plain English;
and if the Texts to which he refers will not bear him out in his
assertions, I shall certainly not be ready to receive his doctrine
at all.—Eccles. xii. 14, is his first reference: let us transcribe
the words at length, since he has not thought them worth his
valuable paper-room —For God shall bring every work into
ECCE HOMO ! 5
judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or
whether it be evil. What I am to gather from this, in favour
the Doctor's Art, I candidly acknowledge myself ignorant:
—perhaps I may be less in the dark in the next text: Matt.
xii. 36, 37—But I say unto you, that every idle word that men
shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judg
ment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy
words thou shalt be condemned! Here, alas! I am as ignorant
as ever: but I think the tables may be very fairly turned;
and if the Doctor will take the trouble, he will readily find
room to apply it to the Cabinet of Wealth.
For the present, I shall pass over the remainder of the
Scripture references here, and his formal and legal caution to
Printers and Publishers, against pirating his Valuable and
Useful Publication; and proceed to page 4 of this book.—
Here I have met with an unaccountable disappointment; for
though I sought very earnestly to find a portion of the Doc
tor's Flowers of Literature,—alas! they had
melted into air—thin air :
and left behind them only a Nauseating Bouquet, of the
Flowers of EGoTIsM, and the very Quintessence of BoMBAs
T1c EFFRONTERY. “Fair play,” however, says the old
Proverb, “is a jewel,” and as I can give no adequate de
scription of these Flowers, the Doctor himself must display
them.
“Ifthere can be found any Wise and Learned Gentle
man, in any part of England, Scotland, or Wales, that
can either Confute, Defeat, or Prove to be False and
Erroneous, any Subject, Matter, Article, or Thing, con
tained in this Book—all such persons will be fully entitled
to the SILVER CUP, offered in my Universal Fortune Teller,
pages 65 and 12.” -
I forbear any further Remark upon this Modest and Sen
sible Challenge, because I would not offer such an Insult to
Common Understanding. The person who has been Educa
B 2
6 ECCE HOMO !
ted sufficiently to peruse these pages, has comprehension
enough to estimate it at its True Value.
He goes on—
“No person ought to be without this most Valuable,
Interesting, and Entertaining Book, which we now present
unto them for Sixpence only; giving them at the same
time, full possession of the Cabinet of Wealth, or the Tem
ple of Wisdom; leading the way to Know all things Past,
Present, and To Come; together with the blessings of
Health, Wealth, &c.”
Valuable—Interesting—and Entertaining ! I must al
low the Reader, in the words of honest Dogberry, to “write
me down an ass;” for I am too stupid to discover either the
Value, the Interest, or the Entertainment this publication has
bestowed upon the World.—Nay, I am really such an Igno
ramus, that, though I have read it very attentively, I know no
more of the Past or Present, than I should have done, had it
still been slumbering in the Doctor's brain; much less of
the Future. It is, indeed, nothing more than a few pages of
Advertisements, couched in the style of the Puff Direct, to
put off his fanciful Lamens; and for which, if I were the
Printer, I should expect to be called upon for the Stamp-office
Duty. I shall, however, follow him through the Catalogue
of these Lamens: perhaps my Reader may have more pene
tration than myself, and reap a greater advantage from them
than I have done.—He says—
“The DocToR, (who is a most zealous Member and
Defender of the Church of England,)”—
Mark this, Gentle Reader! and give praise to God, that
the Church of England is honoured with a Member so Pious
and so Holy! But remember the Doctor's zeal for Old Mo
ther Church did not show itself at all, until he was Ousted
from a Dissenting Congregation, as a Drunkard and a Hypo
crile.
ECCE HOMO ! 7
—“being also the Author of several most Useful and
Valuable Publications,”—
I suppose, THE UNIVERSAL FoRTUNE-TELLER—Useful
enough ! and SHEETs of ADVERTISEMENTs-Valuable e
nough !
—“now begs leave to inform the Public, that he hath
constantly on Sale, a Valuable Set of Holy Consecrated
Philosophical Lamens, Pentacles, Papers, Writings, Amu
lets, Telesmes, &c. by which means every afflicted person
may have the Virtues of all their said Medicines [Qu.
What said Medicines?] so much increased and augmented,
that the sick and the diseased will be most speedily restored
to their former good state of Health, by the same, if
curable.”
IF cuRABLE / This word, IF, is a Valuable Preposi
tion in our language; particularly to the Doctor, as it may in
some cases save his credit.
Then comes an enumeration of these Holy Consecrated
Lamens, made “by the Rules of SPIRITUAL AsTRöLoGY,”
the FIRST of which is -
* The opinion of the great Dr. Adam Clarke, than whom a more
pious and learned man perhaps never lived, as to the pretended sci
ence of Astrology, may be gathered from his sending the following
anecdote, from the French, to the Editor of the Arminian Magazine,
for 1797; and which I have taken the liberty to copy below. I do
not know, but I really believe, the arguments there adduced, will not
easily be controverted, even by Dr. Parkins himself.
“DEAR SIR,-As the Science of Judicial Astrology, which pre
tends to foretel future Events, by the Aspects, Positions, and Influ
ences of the heavenly bodies, has not yet fallen into that contempt,
with some persons, which, I think, it merits from all; permit me to
recommend to your readers the following extract from the second
book of BARcLAY's Argenis. Under Catherine de Medicis, and Henry
III. and IV. of France, the predictions of Astrologers were a com
mon theme of court conversation. An Astrologer having undertaken
to instruct Henry III. in the event of a war threatened by the faction
of the Guises, in 1588; Barclay attacked him thus:
$ ECCE HOMO !
“calculated to prevent the common Miseries of Human
Life; showing also the best method of Preventing the Utter
Ruin and Destruction of Kingdoms and States.”
The Man who dares thus set himself up, is either One
“‘You maintain that the circumstances of Life and Death de
pend on the place and influence of the celestial bodies, at the time when
the child first comes to light; and yet own that the heavens revolve
with such vast rapidity, that the situation of the stars is considerably
changed in the least point of time.—What certainty then can there
be in your art, unless you suppose the midwives constantly careful to
observe the clock, that the minute of time may be conveyed to the in
fant as we do his patrimony ? How often does the mother's danger
prevent this care ? And how many are there who are not influenced
by this superstition ? But supposing them watchful to your wish; if
the child be long in the birth, which state of the stars is to determine
for him? I say nothing of the common errors of clocks and other
time-keepers, sufficient to elude all your cares!
“‘Again, why are we to regard the stars, only at his Nativity,
and not those rather which shone when the Foetus was first animated?
And why must those others be excluded which presided while the
body remained tender and susceptible of the weakest impression, du
ring Gestation 3
“‘But setting this aside, and supposing the face of the heavens
accurately known: whence arises this dominion of the stars over our
bodies and minds, that they must be the arbiters of our happiness, our
manner of life and death? Were all those who went to battle and
died together, born under the same position of the heavens? And,
when a ship is to be cast away, shall it admit no passengers, but those
doomed by the stars to suffer shipwreck? Or, rather, do not persons
born under every planet go into battle, or on board the vessel, and
notwithstanding the disparity of their birth, perish alike? Again, all
born under the same configuration of the stars, do not live or die in
the same manner. Are all who were born at the same time with the
King, Monarchs? Or, are they all even alive at this day ? View M.
Villeroy here; nay, view yourself; were all who came into the world
with him, as wise and virtuous as he ; or all born under your own stars,
Astrologers like you? If a man be slain by a robber, you will say,
he was doomed to perish by a robber's hand; but did the same stars
which, when the traveller was born, subjected him to the robber's
sword—did they likewise give the robber, who perhaps was born
long before, a power and inclination to kill him ? For you will allow,
...UCE HOMO ! 9
sent of God, or the most Despicable of IMPostors. How
far the Doctor merits the Former of these designations, is the
object of this Inquiry. To attempt to prove himself a Man
of God, he lugs into his service such an abundance of Texts
that it is as much owing to the stars that the one kills, as that the
other is killed. And when a man is overwhelmed by the fall of a
house, did the walls become faulty, because the stars doomed him to
die thereby; or, rather, was not his death owing to this, that the walls
were faulty The same may be said of honours and employs ; be
cause the stars which shone at a man's nativity, promised him prefer
ment, could those have an influence over other persons not born under
them, by whose suffrages he was to rise ? Or how do the stars at one
man's birth annul or set aside the contrary influences of other stars,
which shone at the birth of another ?
“‘The truth is, supposing the reality of all the planetary powers
—as the Sun which visits an infinity of bodies with the same rays, has
not the same effect on all; but some things are hardened thereby, as
clay; some are softened thereby, as wax : some reeds cherished, others
destroyed: the tender herbs scorched up, the others secured by their
coarser juice: so, where so many children are born together, like a
field tilled so many different ways, according to the various health,
habitude, and temperament of the parents, the same celestial influx
must operate differently. If the genius be suitable and towardly,
it must predominate therein: if contrary, it will only correct it. So
that to foretell the life and manners of a child, you are not only to
look into the heavens, but into the parents, into the fortune which at
tended the pregnant mother, and a thousand other circumstances, ut
terly inaccessible.
“‘Further, does the power which portends the new-born infant
a life (for instance) of 40 years; or perhaps a violent death at 30;
does that power, I say, endure and reside in the heavens, waiting the
destined time, when, descending on earth, it may produce such an
effect : Or is it infused into the infant itself; so that being cherished,
and gradually growing up with it, it bursts forth at the appointed
time, and fulfils what the stars had given it in charge * Persist in the
heavens it cannot; in that, depending immediately on a certain con
figuration of the stars, when that is changed, the effect connected with
it must cease, and a new, perhaps a contrary one, take place. What
repository have you then for the former power to remain in, till the
time come for its delivery ? If you say it resides in the infant, not to
operate upon him till he be grown to manhood; the answer is more

preposterous than the former: for this, in the instance of a shipwreck,
you must suppose the cause why the winds rise, and the ship is leaky,
or the Pilot, through ignorance of the place, runs on a shoal or rock.
So the Farmer is the cause of the war that impoverishes him, or of the

“‘You boast much of the event of a few predictions, which, con
sidering the multitude of those which your art has produced, plainly

Out of so many conjectures, it must be preternatural if some did not
hit; and it is certain, considering you only as Guessers, there is no
room to boast you have been successful therein. Do you know what
fate awaits France in this War, and yet are not apprehensive what
shall befal yourself? Did you not foresee the opposition I was this

his enemies, find out first whether he will believe you.’
“In the above extract this impudent science is successfully rallied;
its vain pretensions properly exposed; and the absurdity of its princi

“A science which cashiers Divine Providence from the Universe,
and pretends to govern the World, direct, counteract, and variously
influence all human actions, by Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mer

acknowledged as possessing the very same powers which quondam
heathenish idolators ascribed to them, is, in my opinion, worthy of
the EXECRATION of every person who believes there is a God,

ces appended to each Lamen, and leave it to chance to dis
cover, how much their meaning is perverted, to suit the
Doctor's purposes. Here then, his first text is Hosea v. 15–
I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their
offence, and seek my face : in their AFFLICTIONs they will
seek me early. And does the Doctor mean to say, that they
(the People, the Kingdoms, and the States) shall seek HIM in
their Afflictions, or the ALMIGHTY : If the Former, he has
fairly taken the First Step towards Blasphemy: if the Latter,
I reply, that I hope Religion is not yet at so low an ebb
amongst us, as to make it necessary to purchase a Lamen, in
order to inform or remind us, of our Dependence upon God,
and of the necessity of our coming to him in our afflictions.—
Heb. ii. 15–17–And deliver them who through fear of death
were all their life-time subject to bondage. For verily he took
not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed
of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be
made like unto his brethren ; that he might be a merciful and
faithful high-priest, in things pertaining unto God, to make
reconciliation for the sins of the people.—What am I to say to
this? I am in a Predicament as bad, or worse, than when I
acknowledged myself Ignorant a page or two backward.—
I must solicit the Doctor to harmonize the Text with the
Lamen.
SEcond LAMEN.—“Any Lady may have a Clear, Full,
and most Perfect Sight of the Gentleman she will Marry,
so as to perfectly know him by a Vision or Dream in the
Night.”—Joel ii. 28–And it shall come to pass afterward,
that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons
and your daughters shall prophecy, your old men shall
dream dreams, your joung men shall see visions.
And what have the Old Men's Dreams, and the Young
Men's Visions, to do with Dr. PARKINs's “Gentleman she
will marry?” Sensual Enjoyment, and Amorous Desires,
were, then, one would infer, the circumstances of which Joel
12 ECCE HOMO !
prophecied! Can it be, that the God of Abraham, of Isaac,
and of Jacob—that God who is the Sum and the Essence of
Perfection and Purity—should thus become the Subject and
the Object of Lustful Dreams and Charms? submit himself
to the controul and caprices of a Worm of Dust—a Wretch,
in whose mouth a line of Satan's Soliloquy in MILTON would
be more appropriate
* EVIL I BE THOU MY GOOD !”
This is, indeed making the Scriptures the source of Some
thing, or of Nothing—of Excellency, or of Profligacy—of
Holiness, or Impiety.
But to proceed—The next Text is from Acts ii. 17, 18;
and the words are an entire repetition of Joel's. As it will be
useless to transcribe the whole of the Second Chapter of Acts,
(and without the Context the Quoted Verses have no separate
signification.) I would refer my Reader to his New Testament.
The Remarks here necessary will there be amply supplied;—
but if he have the opportunity, let him consult Dr. CLARKE's
Reflection on Genesis xL. where he takes occasion to condemn
the too-familiar practice of injudiciously Allegorizing many
parts of Scripture. But while he so strongly declaims against
that which the Candour or Supineness of some would look
over, or at least attribute to no Evil Intention—what would
he say to the Dreadful Perversions of Dr. PARK1Ns 2—For
the sake of those who do not happen to have Dr. CLARKE to
refer to, I shall take the liberty to give a short Extract.
“We should beware,” says he, “how we attribute De
signs to GoD that he never had; and employ the Holy Spirit
in forming Trifling and Unimportant Similitudes. Of Plain,
Direct Truth, we shall find as much in the Sacred Writings as
we can receive and comprehend : let us not, therefore, hew
out unto ourselves Broken Cisterns, that can hold no Water.
Interpretations of this kind only tend to render the Sacred
Writings uncertain, to expose to ridicule all the solemn types
ECCE HOMO ! 13
and figures which it really contains, and to furnish pretexts to
Infidels and Irreligious People to scoff at all Spirituality, and
lead them to reject the Word of God entirely, as incapable of
being interpreted on any Fixed or Rational Plan. The Mis
chief done by this system is really Incalculable.”
THIRD LAMEN.—“By the use of the same, a Lady
may Marry the Gentleman she Loves, if agreeable to the
Will of God, and fully enjoy Happiness and Felicity after
Marriage.”
IF, again! well done, Doctor! But I surmise, that any
Marriage agreeable to the Will of Heaven is as likely to be
solemnized without the Doctor's Lamen, as with it. And I
maintain, that Happiness and Felicity are More Plausibly to
be expected as the concomitants of a Marriage where a Sym
pathy of Soul operates as the attractive, rather than a transit
ory lustful passion, the gratification of which is to be purcha
sed through the medium of Familiar Spirits. . Let us not,
however, pass over the Doctor's sentences of Scripture.
2 Cor. vi. 14–18–Be ye not unequally yoked together
with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness
with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with
darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial # or
what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? And what
agreement hath the temple of God with idols for ye are the
temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in
them and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they
shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among
them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the
unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father
unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the
Lord Almighty. -
* It may not be amiss by the way to acknowledge that the Writer
of these, Remarks is NO METHOD1ST; though he owns himself
much indebted to Dr. Clarke for some of his Observations. And the

“IF” the Lady from Newark had possessed one of these

Jornication, and she repented not. Behold I will cast her
into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into
great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds.
Denunciations against Fornicators and Adulterers.—Let
the most forward of the Doctor's Partizans declare, how far
his high-boasted Lamens will operate as Preventives to these
sins. IF he can prevent them, I will acknowledge him ca
pable of controuling the Strongest of all Human Passions.
But that mysterious “IF:” IF that word were erased from
the English Dictionary, I might rest more satisfied, and be
more inclined to become a Disciple of the Doctor's.

Those, I am sure, who neglect the only and proper means
of obtaining the Protection of God,—Prayer, united to Faith

ready way to Incur the Divine Displeasure, and to Forfeit all
Claim to the Protection of Heaven.
John xvi. 21—A woman when she is in travail, hath
sorrow, because her hour is come; but as soon as she is de
livered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish
for joy that a man is born into the world.
A Metaphor used by Our Lord, in reference to the Sor
row of his Disciples on account of the approaching Crucifix
ion, accompanied with the Promise of their being visited by
the Holy Ghost, the Comforter. How much it has to do
with the Preservation of Women in Travail by Lamenism,
may, I think,safely be left to the Judgment of the Reader.

One Solitary Instance of his having Done this, and I will then
candidly subscribe to All his assertions. I may, I hope, be
pardoned, if I anticipate the Doctor's Reply. “Though I

2 Kings vi. 15–17–And when the servant of the man

compassed the city both with horses and chariots: and his

And he answered, Fear not : for they that be with us are

said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And
the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw:
and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of
fire round about Elisha.
Whether Elisha bequeathed the Mantle of Elijah to Doc
tor Parkins, and dubbed him thereby, a Prophet and a Holy
Man of God all at once, I shall not stop to inquire: but cer
tain it is, that he Professes to furnish all his “KIND CUs
ToMERs” with the same Angelic Invisible Guard that protected
Elisha, by the Power of his Lamen. Really, one's Faith

Josh. i. 8, and I shall take that verse at a venture: premising,
however, that, as there is a Doubt, I will not be too harsh
with the Doctor, if it have no more relation than his other
Texts, to the Lamen. -
—This book of the law shall not depart out of thy
mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that
thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written
therein: for then thou shall make thy way prosperous, and
then thou shalt have good success.

Verily, one might suppose the Doctor to have been a resi

a Solitary Instance of Concord, one might think it caused
the Rules of his Art; but I trust there are Millions as
Happy in the Married State as himself, who never heard
either of him or his Lamen. The ordinary means of the
Gospel, when properly attended to, are sufficient to Prevent
Discord in every line of life; and if a Lamen will do as much
without the Gospel, it might as well be laidaside altogether.
2 Cor. vi. 14–18-. . . . . . • * - -
The same Textis appended to the Third Lamen, page 13,
where the Reader will find the passage extracted. Here, how
ever, the Doctor would have it bear a Different Signification.
When parties are Unequally Yoked, (and All have not the
Wisdom to apply to Dr. Parkins preparatory to Matrimony.)
of what avail is it Then to say, Be not Unequally Yoked?—
It is very like shouting to a Drowning Man, Do not Fall into
the Water.

washed your feet, ye ought also to wash one another'sfeet.

for all those persons who have any reason to suppose

“Note. If there were no such things, as some sup
pose, there need not have been an Act of Parliament made
against it.”
This Act of Parliament, it should be remembered, was
passed in the Reign of James I. a Prince of good natural
parts, but remarkably bigotted in the Belief of Witches. In
ECCE HOMO ! 19
the 23rd year of his age he had the examination of Agnes
Sympson, commonly called The wise Wife of Keith, and
several others, accused of Witchcraft. Two or three years
after, the King published his DzMonolog1A; that is, (as ap
pears by the Name and the Book together,) The Doctrine of
Devils and Witchcraft: and coming to the English Crown
some few years after, and the Act referred to by Doctor Par
Kins being passed in the very first Parliament he held in Eng
land, I cannot forbear thinking, that it was the King's Book
and Judgment, more than the real existence of Witches, that
influenced the Parliament to Pass the Superstitious Statute.
Be that as it may, however; the Act is Equally Applica
ble to the Doctor, as to any of the Poor Wretches who have
ever suffered under it: for it includes ALL who Make or
Devise any Charm or Enchantment for Any Purpose whatso
ever, wiTHoUT ANY PARTIALITY or ExcEPTION ; and it also
Expressly Forbids ALL USE AND EXERCISE OF
ANY CHARM FOR EMPLOYING SPIRITS; and
Punishes the Guilty Person with DEATH, IF THEY Do
HARM. To MAN or BEAsT, and with IMPRISONMENT
and PILLORY, THovg|I THEIR CHARMs HAVE No EF
FEcT.—Hence we perceive, that the Doctor, as the Preparer
of the Charm, and the Foolish Purchaser who Uses it, are
Equally Culpable, and Equally Punishable.
The case of the person at Louth," who, by the Doctor's
account, was reduced from Health to Sickness, from Sickness
to the Grave, is a Direct Avowal of His having Used Charms
for Employing Spirits; and that these Spirits, by virtue of his
Art, caused DEATH ; and he Triumphantly Exults in having
Deprived a Fellow-creature of Life, without any Proof of
Guilt, and Free even from Suspicion. *
* See Book of Miracles, pp. 36 et seq. A particular Relation of
this Pretended Miracle will be given in our Review of that work.

Ridiculous, however, as is the Belief of such being the
Fact, (yet there are those who do believe it.) I should conceive
the Civil Power laudably engaged, in Prosecuting the Doctor
under this Act; and though I should beloth to pass upon him
a Sentence of Death, I would certainly inflict upon him the
punishment of Imprisonment and Pillory, and Prohibit him
from further Misleading the Ignorant.
That the Art he practises to protect others, is incapable to
preserve himself from Trouble, was exemplified in 1810;
when a venerable Reverend Gentleman, now no more, exhib
ited charges against him as a Conjuror and Fortune-teller, at
the Grantham General Sessions. His Angelic Ministers then
scurvily Forsook him; and it was only by the Payment of a

those who Purchasethem, as he asserts theydo; I feel no hesi
tation in my own mind to Ascribe that Power to the Angels
of the INFERNAL REGIONs, in Opposition to all his Boasting
Pretensions of Heavenly Angelic Agency; and this I do with
out judging myself liable to commit THE SIN against the

Diabolical Control, being similar to that of Simon Magus and
Elymas the Sorcerer; for the Satisfaction of those whose
entire Dependence is upon the Lord, they have as Little Oc
casion to Fear his Power, as to Require his Aid; for “Surely

their Behalf: they are also Made, Consecrated, and Pre

A Summary of all the Absurdities contained in the pre
ceding Eleven.
I have now gone through these Lamens; and with no
small degree of unpleasantness. The Grossness of their Pre
tensions, and the Presumptuousness of the Language, are by
no means calculated to afford any thing like gratification.—
But the task I have undertaken, however disagreeable, must
be persevered in, till a full Exposure of his Horrid Publica
tions be completed.—I owe him no Personal Animosity; to
me he has done no injury. But we have a two-fold duty to
perform—to Ourselves and to Society: and it is in the exercise
of the Latter that I have taken up arms against him. I am
Careless of the Consequences of his Angry Resentment;—I
Defy his Vengeance, as heartily as I Despise His Works, and
Deny his Power! Let him enter in his Celestial Court an
Action, “The ARMY of HEAven versus The WRITER of
these REMARKs;” [I presume it will not be necessary to tell
him my Name;] if he prevail and Crush Me, then, like
the Thief upon the Cross, I shall acknowledge the Sin I have
committed, and solicit the Forgiveness of God and Doctor
Parkins.
Before I proceed to the next passage of this “Cabinet,”
it may not be amiss to inform the reader what these Lamens
are, and by what Authority they act, as far as I can learn from
the Doctor's account of them.—In a very notable Nota Bene,
We are desired to
24 ECCE HOMO !
—“observe that these Holy CoNSECRATED LAMENs,
&c. are not composed of any Diabolical Charms, &c. but
on the contrary, they are Spiritual and Celestial Treasures,
wherein is contained the Great Power, Strength, Force,
and Virtue of the ever-blessed TRINITY,-FATHER,
SON, and HOLY GHOST; by whose Power and Au
thority alone, they daily act and perform all their Spiritual
and Wonderful Operations and Works herein mentioned.
If any person shall inquire How they receive their said
Virtues, &c.? let me also ask them, Who gives Virtue to
the Grass and Herbs of the Field? All things are Possi
ble with God, by and in whose Power and Authority alone
these Lamens, &c. daily perform all their most Wonderful
Works and Operations, &c.—The Intent and Meaning of
these said Holy Lamens &c. is, that they bind them to their
duty to God, fully engage the Army of Heaven into their
service, and confer upon them a Celestial, Angelic, Invisible
Guard, to attend the Bearer thereof, in order to Defend them
in the Time of Danger, and also to do all such things as is
therein mentioned, which may be agreeable and consistent
with the Will of God.”
And the same passage is copied in pages 10 and 11 of
his Book of Miracles.—His corroborative Texts, however, as
usual, corroborate nothing to the purpose. -
Matt. xix. 26–But Jesus beheld them, and said unto
them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things
are possible.
That all things are possible with God, we need not be
told by this man; but the probability that God should transfer
the Obedience of the Angelic Host from Himself to Doctor
Parkins, and constitute Him his Grand Ambassador upon
Earth, is as Doubtful as that he should Unite with Beelzebub
to Destroy the World he has Created, and to Ruin the Souls
of those whom Jesus died to Save. w -

A Lady of Newark, a few years ago, had a Correspond

from motives of Delicacy, I am Unwilling to Communicate.
It appears that an Acquaintance arose between them, and the
Lady was strongly importuned to become an Inmate at the
Temple of Wisdom. An Apartment was to be Fitted-up
for her Reception and Accommodation, to be called Miss

vi. 44.
The Softer Sex are more susceptible to Belief in the

particular Address to them. As the Weaker Wessel, they
have the greater Claim to Protection and to Caution; and I
am the more anxious to expose the man to Them, than to
those whose Stronger Intellect ought to operate as Caution
sufficient: but it is Deplorable, that to some of the Latter,

also, the Expose is too necessary. I forbear to notice his
Texts further than—they Relate as Much to the Subject, and
Substantiate as Much, as Tom Paine's Common Sense does
Tycho Brahe's System of Astronomy.
In the same page (11) of this Cabinet of Wealth, we
have the “The GRAND PORTABLE CELESTIAL
ORACLE,” at the very moderate rate of “from TEN to
THIRTY Guineas each, suited to the conveniency of Purcha
sers.”—To this article he has printed a Scrap of Latin as a
Head or Motto: who befriended him with this precious
morceau, I know not; but this I do know—that He is as
Conversant with the Latin Language as I am with that of the
Arctic Highlanders. “Optima Revelatio Stella : ” The
most Literal Translation of which is,—“A STAR is the

Comment upon. But let us see first how far his Texts bear
him out.

1 Thess. v. 20–Despise not Prophesying.
By his reference to this Passage, I presume he would have
us believe him a Prophet; possessing a supernatural gift to
reveal the Hidden Mysteries of Futurity, by the configura
fond of Mirth and Mischief, and withal, a right Bacchanalian. In
one of his Nocturnal Wagaries, accompanied by another or two of
his Funny Companions, he mounted the Roof of the Sanctum Sancto

Holy Chimney. Next Day the Unambitious Smoke, instead of mak
ing its usual Exit through the Funnel,—
“In Mazy Curls Paraded round the Room,”

Cheeks as Red with Rage. He Stormed, he Raved, he Swore;” but
Mr. Smoke was obstinate, and Haunted him most Mercilessly. At
last, after a Minute Investigation, the Obstruction was perceived, and
OLD HUGH, little suspected as the Scoundrel who fired it, was summoned
to the “Celestial” Presence, and bargained with, for a Shilling, to
remove it. Again the Summit of Minerva's Temple was trod by Un
hallowed Feet; and the high-exalted Implement of Husbandry hum
bled to its more congenial Sphere. HUGH received his Shilling; and

tion of the Heavenly Bodies,—“A Star,” in His Estimation,
“being the Best Revelation;” so that whatever he may be in
clined to palm upon mankind about his “past, present, and
to come;” at their Peril they Despise it. But how sadly has
the Doctor Perverted this verse of the Apostle's I assert, it
will not bear the Construction he wishes to put upon it;
and I am surprised he is not alarmed for his own Personal
Safety, and not afraid of the Judgments of God falling upon
him, for the Unwarrantable and Licentious Misconstructions
he so profusely puts upon his Most Holy Word.—I cannot
but express my Suspicions, that he is hereby exposing himself
to the Dreadful Curses denounced in the second chapter of
the second General Epistle of Saint Peter; there appearing
such a Striking Comparison between Him and the Characters
there pourtrayed, against the Subtlety of whose Doctrines
At the time the Doctor’s Fame ran so high at Louth, a poor fellow
in that neighbourhood lost his Cow, and was advised to apply to the
Doctor to find her. Poor Hodge travelled over, and arrived at
Little Gonerby towards Evening: the Doctor not being at home, he
got a pint of good Nutbrown, and walked about near the Residence,
till
“Sable Night her dusky curtain drew,”
cogitating, no doubt, upon his dear lost Colin. At last he bethought
him to put the Great Man's Knowledge to the Proof, ere he Hazarded
his Guinea; and being much in Need, sacrilegiously Befouled the
Temple Steps. Soon after, with Long and Pompous Strides, arrived
the High and Mighty Magus; and, owing to the Nastiness and Slip
periness of the place, Sprawled his “Fine Form” upon the Filthy
Spot. Words of Dire Import, Curses both Loud and Deep, and
Threatenings Terrible,
“Enough to bid the heart's best Blood run Chill,”

the Apostle Cautions the Church of Christ.—The serious
reader would do well to consult that chapter.
Does not the Monitor Conscience, if a Conscience the
Doctor possess, warn him to Recant his Principles—to Sup
press his Publications—and to Desist from any Further Pre
tensions? Or is his state that awful one, wherein, having so
long Resisted the Principle of Truth, God has sent him.
Strong Delusion that he may Believe a Lie?—If he be a
Prophet, or an Ambassador; why not act as the Prophets and
Ambassadors of God in Scripture; who prophesied not for
the sake of Filthy Lucre; neither preached Themselves, but
CHRIST Jesus the LoRD, and Themselves the Servants of
All? “We seek not Your's,” say they, “but You.” But
there is appended at every verse end of this Pretender's Pro
phecies, the Signature of Balaam's God—MonEY. O how
unlike to one commissioned of the Most High !
What the Apostle means by Despise not Prophesying, is
simply in reference to Preaching or Expounding the Scrip
tures; and not the Abstruse and Sophisticated Construction
Doctor Parkins puts upon the words.—Preaching the Gospel
is the Ordinary Channel through which it has pleased God to
communicate Divine Instruction to the Mind of Man; and
to Despise this Ordinance, is, in effect, to Pour Contempt
upon the Authority of the ALMIGHTY, and Reject the Essen
tial Benefits of Religion. “It hath pleased God,” says Saint
Paul, “by the foolishness of Preaching, to save them that
believe.” Not foolishness essentially so, but looked upon as
such by the wisdom of this world; and those who do not
discern the spirituality of the Scriptures—“The natural man
receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are
foolisuNEssunto him: neither can he KNow them, because
they are spIRITUALLY DISCERNED.”—But Doctor Parkins is
labouring to “darken counsel by words without knowledge,”
and to make it appear that the Almighty has sent him on an
ECCE HOMO ! 33
Extraordinary Embassy, to communicate to mankind in these
lower regions, from Stary Aspects and Angelic Agency, some
thing essential to be known, which his Omnisciency overlook
ed when the Books of the Prophecies were sealed;—thus
beguiling “the ignorant and unstable,” and leading them
“from the Simplicity of the Gospel, to Trust in Lying Van
ities.”—It is true, he is very desirous it should be understood
that he is a Lover of the Bible, and that his Peculiar Art is
Founded on the Basis of Scripture Revelation: but it is very
observable, that he is equally desirous for it to be understood
that the Bible will Avail but Little without the Appendage of
his Fulsome Lamens; which, like the Traditions of the Jews,
and the Bulls of the Popes, render the Word of God of None
Effect.—I would not have the Christian world imagine, that
the abundant Scripture References made by the Doctor, is a
sufficient reason for them to give credence to his asserted
power, and proclaim him a man Sent of God, or something
More than Mortal: No; Satan can quote Scripture when it
serves his purpose, and thus transform himself into an Angel
of Light. No marvel therefore that his Emisaries follow
his Example. But I trust it will be unnecessary to give any
further Caution here against the Deceptions of this False
Prophet, as I think the “the Mark of the Beast in his Fore
head,” has been sufficiently delineated, to discover to the
discriminating mind, his Perfidious Intentions.
As it respects Extraordinary and Supernatural Revelation,

subsided with the Revelation of Saint John, who Concludes
the Volume of Truth with these Awful Words of Jesus
Christ;—“If Any Man shall ADD unto these things, God
shall ADD Unto Him the PLAGUEs that are Written in this
Book: and if Any Man shall TAKE AWAY from the
Words of the Book of this Prophecy, God shall TAKE Away
His PART out of the Book of Life, and out of the Holy
City, and from the Things which are Written in this Book,
34 ECCE HOMO !
He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly:
Amen.”—From this concluding passage of Scripture, we may
gather the Dreadful Condition of That Man who Pretends to
Wisdom Beyond what is Written—to Deal Out the Word of
God Deceitfully—or Add To, or Take From, the Holy
Scriptures;—ANATHEMA MARAN-ATHA—the CURsk of GoD
Is Upon HIM.—Those, also, whose inclinations lead them to
pry into the Secrets of their Own Lives, and the Mysteries of
Futurity, are justly reprehensible in the sight of their Maker,
and in the estimation of every Good Man. “Secret things
belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are
revealed belong unto us, and to our children for ever.”—All
which the Almighty has thought proper for us to know, is
contained in his Word; wherein is sufficient to instruct us
in the Faith and Practice of Christianity; and it becomes our
Duty, as well as our Privilege, to attend to those Means
which he has so wisely and benevolently instituted in his
Church, for the Application of his Promises to our Hearts;
which is the Sum and Substance of Gospel Prophecy. “The
Gospel of Christ,” says the Apostle, “is the Power of God
unto Salvation, to every one that Believeth.” And, “Our
Gospel came not unto you in Word only, but also in Power,
and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance.”
Perhaps I may be considered here, as Over Prolix; and
by some as verging too much on Cant and Methodism;" but
in extenuation I would observe, that, as this Text is one of
the Doctor's Strong Holds, I wish to assail him on all sides,
so as to Divest him of every Subterfuge and Covering, and
leave him no way by which he may Retreat; that his Hy
pocrisy may be Unmasked, and Truth Exhibited in her proper

Colours. And as I anticipate this Work falling into the hands
of persons of different Religious Opinions, I am anxious to
serve the Interests of All, by rendering the Doctor's Publica
tions Odious in Every Point of View. Besides, as I think
there is no Sentiment promulged here contrary to the Princi
ples of Christian Liberality, my Remark upon this Text can
not, I submit, be set down as the Offspring of a Sectarist.—
The Prolixity observable here, too, will tend to Brevity in my
Future Observations.
To proceed.—" Optima Revelatio Stella "—This System
of Spiritual Astrology mighthave gained Credence, and have
raised Admiration among the Ancient Romans; for it would
not have been inconsistent with their Belief of Augurers and
Soothsayers: but to affirm a Star to be the Best Revelation to
those who believe the New Testament, is Ridiculous. The
Doctrine of Starry, or Planetary Influence, is as Absurd as it
is Contemptible; and the Inferences deduced from the Cal
culations of Nativities, are as Mystical and Ambiguous as the
Answers Delivered by the ORAcLE of DELPHos.—I have
already clearly intimated my Opinion of the Fallacy of this
Science, in giving insertion to the Letter of Dr. A. Clarke.—
But I would add, nevertheless, my Full Conviction, that
there neither Is nor Can be any Better Revelation than that
which God has been pleased to make in his Word. We
have enough there to teach us to “bear those ills we have”
with resignation; and to guard us against those “we know
not of;” and these the Doctor's Astrology cannot Foretell,
nor his Lamens Avert. -
Allowing, for the Sake of Argument, the Science of As
trology to be genuine, and admitting the possibility of its pro
fessors to Foretell Future Contingencies; I am more than
doubtful that it can any way Benefit Mankind. I am well
assured that Prognostications, whether of Good or Evil Im
port, are Equally Destructive of Happiness. If we have any
36 ECCE HOMO !
thing Beneficial in Anticipation, we are Miserable till the
time arrive that we may receive it—every intervening day ap
pears an Age; and it is more than likely that we neglect the
very means that would contribute to our Present, and perhaps
our Future Welfare, in the Visionary Hope of the Realization
of the Astrologer's Prediction.—If we are to look for Evil,
“How Comfortless Passes the Day !”—
the Days that would otherwise have been pregnant with
Health, Prosperity, and Felicity, pass away Without Enjoy
ment: the Mind becomes Despondent and Uneasy, as it
contemplates the Approach of the Dreaded, Anticipated
Hour.—We fancy we Perceive Sorrow; but we cannot
Avert it. The Doctor, I know, will say, Come and Hasten
unto Me—Produce me One Guinea before-hand—
(“Put the Moxey on the Plate,
Or I, your” Doctor, “cannot eat,”)
and you shall receive the Great Benefit of our Holy CoNse
CRATED LAMEN, which will ensure you the Service of the
Angels of Heaven, and Prevent all the Accidents and Dangers
in your Nativities, &c. Thus he Gets One Guinea to Foretell
Evils by Astrology, and Another to Avert them by Lamenism!
Fattening upon the Weakness and Credulity of Folly!
The Threat held out to those who shall “join, unite, or
weigh the most Wonderful Works ofGod in the same balance
with Witchcraft and the Works of the Devil,”is thrown away
upon me. I acknowledge myself one of those “Diabolical
Characters,” who believe the Doctor less an Agent of the Al
mighty's than of Satan's: and if I have nothing more to dread
on the Day of Judgment, than the Resentment of this man, I
shall not be Afraid to meet the Decision of God as to my
Everlasting Fate. -

Good. I presume this Immaculate Professor of Infalli
bility seldom or never looks on the Outside of his Study :
because, if he ever see an Individual at all, that Individual
must be little removed from Idiotcy, if he cannot Confute
him. As to Myself, who make an Attempt at Confutation,
I am not a very Distant Neighbour of his; and though I
have thought proper to Withhold my Name, the Doctor will
no doubt be told it by some of his Ministering Spirits. When
he has Found out this, I in my turn Invite him to Pay me a
Visit, and Falsify a Single Paragraph I have written.
We now come to what, I presume, the Doctor considers
the EssENCE of this Cabinet. “A Never-failing Method to
Obtain RICHEs and WEALTH.” Let us see this Never-failing
Method:—
“The Doctor will also engage to Teach any Person
how to make One Single Grain or Corn of Wheat produce
more than Half a Bushel of the same Grain in One Year,
(proved,) so that the Poor Man who has a Garden, may get
as much Bread from the same, as will Support his Family;
the Tradesman may also thus Accumulate as much Mone
as will enable him to Pay his Debts; while the Farmer
may also obtain Riches by the same. Terms, One Guinea.
Where also may be had, The ART of BREWING, showing
how to keep the Best Ale in the Town; together with the
Art of making Fourteen Gallons of Good Ale from One
Bushel of Malt, (proved.) Terms, One Guinea. Any
Person may also at the same time be presented with the
Best Method of Restoring Sour Ale to its former state of
Perfection, (proved.) Terms, One Guinea.”
To attempt to Remark here would be Insulting to the Dull
est Understanding. I am amazed, however, that none of the
poor Prophets or Apostles are brought in, neck and heels, to
ratify this Interesting Clause. Perhaps none of them pos
sessed the Creative Power of Doctor Parkins, or were Adepts
in the Art of Brewing good Stingo.
E.
38 ECCE HOMO !
In the next Paragraph, (a Nota Bene) he invites
—“all those Persons who are Desirous of Supporting
themselves and their Respective Families, to Obtain Wealth
and Riches, and also of Receiving these Great Benefits and
Pecuniary Advantages arising from the Office of becoming
Our Agents in the various Counties in England, Ireland,
Scotland, and Wales”—
to apply to him. What a pity that men should be so stub
born, and should have so much disbelief in the Doctor, not
to run more eagerly after this Lucrative Agency.
I am sorry to be obliged to tire my Reader with a subject
so Unpleasing, and with so many Repetitions: but I wish to
act with Liberality and Fairness to the Doctor: I am willing
to give him full liberty of Speech; but I am also anxious to
Counteract his Unholy Efforts.
“Now may Parents give unto their Children the Best
Present in the World; for here Ladies and Gentlemen
may be regularlyTaught to Read the Book of Life, which
is Written in the Heavens by the Finger of God, with as
much Ease and Facility as they now Read their Bibles.—
And the Doctor will furtherTeach them to Know all things
Past, Present, and To Come, both by Personal and Literal
Application.”
" Take Another Sample of the Doctor's Knowledge of Futurity,
and learn how well he is Capable of Teaching others: the circum
stance occurred while the Doctor lived at Navenby.
An Inhabitant of that place, having Lost some Property, pur
chased one of his Non-descript Charms to Recover it, which, as
might well be supposed, was of no greater Service than rendering
him some Shillings the Poorer. Finding this out, and conceiving
the Doctor's Way of Getting Money closely bordering upon Fraud,
and himself to have been Duped by Artifice, he sent for him to an
Alehouse to consult with him on Business of Importance. The
Ambassador
“Sped on the Wings of the Wind,”
ECCE HOMO ! 39
For my own part, I am so Heartily Sick of his Past,
Present, and To Come, that I really feel myself incompetent
to say more on that subject than I have said.—The Past, he
only knows from Human Information; the Present, he can
tell no more of than what comes within the Ordinary Means
of Intelligence; and the Future, like the rest of Mankind,
with any kind of certainty, he cannot even Guess.
Anxious to display the whole Store of his Florens of
LITERATURE, the Doctor now treats us with the Fruits of an
Excursion into the Blooming Fields of Parnassus. As such
a Rare Variety of the Poetical Species is not to be met with
above Once a Century, (except it be at Catnach's,) I cannot
resist the Inclination to give it all the Publicity in my power:
“Wisdem shall live, and Learning still shall shine,
While Folly dies, and Ignorance doth pine.”
Awake, Pope, from the tomb, and learn the Harmony of
Versification! Goldsmith, arise; let thy Enchanting Muse
gather Instruction from the Inspiring Deity of Minerva's
(whether Riding Astride a Broomstick or not, 1 cannot precisely
say,) and was Courteously Welcomed. But when the Two Men of
Business retired, (as the Doctor thought, to take the Gentleman's
“KIND ORDER,” and his—Money) behold, a well-thonged HORSE
WHIP was produced, and Applied, Secundem Artem, to the Great
Man's Shoulders, to the tune of the Epithets, Swindler, Scoundrel, Im
postor, Villain, and twenty others equally Significant,
“While the Ambassador “at every Thwack,
Bellowed right lustily- MY BACK! MY BACK!’”
Can any thing be more Plainly Demonstrative of the Futility of
the Doctor's Boastings of Fore-knowledge? It is a Proof, at any
rate, that his Art, whatever it may be, is neither Derived from God
nor Good Angels. If it were, he would no doubt have been placed
upon his Guard, and have avoided this Castigation. Most likely his
Old Friend Beelzebub, in one of his Merry Moods, for lack of a
Better Subject, pitched upon the Doctor's Shoulders for his Amuse

with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is
he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, er
cept he interpret, that the church may receive edifying. For
ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all
may be comforted. And the spirits of the prophets are
subject to the prophets. Wherefore, brethren, covet to
prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
From all this I can really gather no more than what the
Doctor has told us before in plain English, that he is, or would
be thought, a Prophet. Whether the great Apostle, or any
of his Predecessors, either under the Christian or Jewish dis
pensation, were Professors of the Science of Divination by
the TEA-cup, or even by CARDs, I am not readily prepared
to answer: but I have my Opinion; and, I dare say, my
Readers have their's.
“The Doctor is also most Fully Enabled to shew the
True Cause of all the Internal and External Calamities by
which this Kingdom is Sore Afflicted, whenever he may
be required so to do.”
* I require him then publicly so to do. Let him answer
my requisition as publicly as I demand his answer; let him
Remove that Cause, and I shall think, as I have never thought
before, that he is a PATRIOT, and may be a HoNEST MAN.—
FIFTY-ONE TEXTS and two et-ceteras. I shall take
however, as usual, the first and last.
1 Cor. xv. 56—The sting of death is sin; and the
strength of sin is the law.
How exquisitely appropriate!
1 John v. 21-Little children, keep yourselves from idols.
Allow me to parody this text. “Doctor Parkins, keep
yourself from idolizing money.”—Patience! more Poetry!

“By iniquity and sin,
Afflictions enter in.”
Truth; but not very Exquisite: a fit counterpart to the
preceding couplet. Will not this remind us of the Sailor's
Beautiful Effusion
“In the Bay of Bengal,
I lost my All ?”
I have but one more paragraph in the Cabinet of Wealth
to review, ere my labours with it be at a close. Fortunately,
however, for my Own Time, and for the Patience of my
Reader, the Conclusion is almost verbatim with the Begin
ning. It is an—“all orders for our Holy Consecrated La
mens,” and enumerates a List of his Four Praise-worthy
Agents; one of them his Brother, a Blacksmith, at Marston,
near Grantham; and the latter lines contain a repetition of
his “Universal Challenge.”
I have now done with this “Cabinet of Wealth;” but
there is something more, ere his Pamphlet be concluded.—
“The CELESTIAL TOUCHSTONE, or a Cox
PANIoN to the TEMPLE of Wisdom and Our CELESTIAL
WARRIOR-Isaiah lviii. 1-Cry aloud, spare not ; lift up
thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their trans
gression, and the house ofJacob their sins. 2 Thes. i. 11,
12—Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God
would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the
good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with
power: That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be
glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of
our God, and the Lord Jesus Christ.”
These Texts imply nothing to assist the Doctor in his
pretentions. Taken abstractedly, they are sentences excel
lently good; but they lend no aid, pro or con, in this Re
view.—With regard to the Touchstone itself; the Language
and the Matter, in most passages, are Admirable: but not
ECCE HOMO ! 43
Half of either is this Man's Composition.—To pass over the
former part of this Touchstone, and his FIVE HUNDRED
and FORTY-FIVE interlarded Texts, he gives us an Alle
gory, which has been used for Samples of Needlework, long
before the Doctor knew the name of the first letter of the al
phabet, and which I have heard my good Old Grandmother
repeat when I was but an Infant. To put no baulk, however,
upon those who are solicitous for the cause of Truth, and are
anxious for its Application, I here reprint it:
“Thus should I daily rejoice to find you that truly
HAPPY MAN, who was born in the City of Regeneration,
in the Parish of Repentance; who was educated in the
School of Obedience; who now lives in Perseverance,
and works at the Trade of Diligence; notwithstanding he
has a large Estate in the County of Christian Contentment;
who often climbs the Mountain of Spiritual Mindedness,
and wears the plain Garb of Humility, but has a better to
ut on when he goes to Court, called the Robe of Christ's
#: who walks in the Valley of Self-abase
ment, and does Jobs of Self-denial; who Breakfasts upon
Spiritual Prayers, and Sups on the same; who has also
Meat to eat which the World knows nothing of; whose
Drink is the sincere Milk of the Word. Thus Happy he
Lives and Happy he Dies. Happy is he who has Gospel
submission in his Will—due Order in his Affections—
sound Peace in his Conscience—Grace in his Soul—real
Divinity in his Breast—true Humility in his Heart—the
Redeemer's Yoke on his Neck—a vain World under his
Feet—and a Crown of Glory on his Head. To attain this,
pray fervently—believe firmly—wait patiently—work a
bundantly—live holy—die daily—watch your Heart—
guide your Actions—redeem Time—love Christ- and long
for Glory !”
Amongst all the Plagiarisms I have met with in the Ce
lestial Touchstone, (and than the Touchstone, I am sure no
Work can contain a greater Number.) I find none more evi
dent than his concluding Hymn; which may be found in
Wesley's Collection, page 19, beginning with
44 - ECCE HOMO !
“Happy the Man that finds the grace,
The blessings of God's chosen race,” &c."
There is something so Barefaced here, that one scarcely
knows how to account for it; Impudence upon Impudence
is so highly piled, that we cannot reach the Summit. Aided
by Truth, our only Effort must be to Strike the Sandy Fabric
at its Base—Truth is as Immutable as Heaven itself; it is In
vincible, and Must Prevail.—This Self-created Shadow must
Dissolve, -
“And, like the Baseless Fabric of a Vision,
Leave not a Wreck behind '"
To comment upon the thing before us any further, in par
ticular, is, I conceive, unnecessary. At the End of this
Work I shall give a few General Remarks; though perhaps
they may be pretty easily anticipated from the preceding pages.
Permit me now to open his next Delectable Production
The CELESTIAL WARRIOR.
At the Outset, the Doctor, as is usual with him, turns his
own trumpetter, or rather the trumpetter of his chiefly-pilfered
bantling. He tells us, (and I am well assured, that if he had
not told its excellency, the World would not have discovered
the Secret,) that it is
“A very Necessary Companion for every Family in this
Kingdom; and also for every Soldier &c. in His Majesty's
Service.”
In one particular, I believe it may be Necessary, or at
least Useful, both for Families and Soldiers; but that partic
ular, be it remembered, must be a NEcEssar Y one !
"A Gentleman not altogether aware of the Doctor's Itch for
Literary Pilfering, once paid him a very high Compliment as the
Writer of this Hymn. He had not, however, Honesty enough to de
clare the Real Author, but modestly took the Credit of it to himself.

Let the Reader take the rest of this exquisite Title-page:
“THE CELESTIAL WARRIOR; or The ART

This is, I think, the First Publication in which he has ta

the immediate Perceptible Inspiration of God himself: and
these, though they announce themselves Ambassadors, have
never dignified themselves with the Magnificent Adjective
this man Audaciously presumes to use. They were Meek,
and Humble, and Lowly—neither Divining for Money, nor
pretending to Bind the Army of Heaven into the Service of
the Wicked. They sought not Pecuniary Reward—they
were anxious to do Good, and looked not for Payment;
they encouraged not Lust—attempted not to “make Ladies
Beautiful and Lovely in the Sight of Man,” but to make ALL
Beautiful and Lovely in the Sight of GoD.—They sought not
to Overcome Adversaries by Lawsuits, but toVanquish them
by Holiness. What a Contrast is here between the Meek
Ambassadors of God, and the Grand Ambassador of Hea

I have carefully read over the Pages that follow this
“Celestial” Title-page.—To Analyze their Contents would ,
be an impossibility. The whole Work is a barbarous com
pound of Lamenism, (if I may use the word,”) Sentences
Stolen from Theologists, Despicable Absurdities, Nonsensical
Nothingness, Burlesque Allegory, and Bombastic Trifling
ism. Young, Thomson, Wesley, and other Admirable Poets,
furnish him with Quotations, as the Scriptures do with Texts,
*—and both are much alike in their Applicability to Lamen
MSII).
A few passages, however, it may not be amiss to tran
scribe for “the Great Benefit” of those who may not have
had the Happiness to peruse the “Celestial” production it
self: my observations will be very concise: indeed, the Mat
ter itself will scarcely require any.
* It includes Blasphemy, for they are so closely interwoven, that
the former cannot exist without the latter.

Preface, page iii—“Gentlemen Soldiers, I now present
unto you this most Valuable Treasure, entitled the Celestial
Warrior, which will not only teach you how to Defeat,
Vanquish, and also Obtain a most Complete Victory over
all your Enemies, both Foreign and Domestic; but will
also most Fully Enable you to CoNQUER the WHOLE
WoRLD.”
“How 3" the Soldier may ask. Reply—Give Doctor .
Parkins that, the Love of which is “the Root of All Evil,”
and he will supply you with a LAMEN'—IF (the Doctor's
accommodating monosyllable)—If it should fail,—it is not
“agreeable to the Will of Heaven” that you should Conquer.
Nota Bene—A MoUse Hol.E is Convenient when a Mouse
is in Danger!
Ibid—“A Soldier's Life is now become the most
Happy, Glorious, and most Desirable Situation under
Heaven;” [I rather doubt it!] “where not only your
Present Happiness, Pleasure, and Delight, are much in
creased therein, but also your Future Happiness and Feli
city are now herein Certainly insured, both in This World
and also in that which is To Come.”
Presumptuous Assertion! If Present Happiness could
be Purchased for a Guinea, who would be miserable? If
Felicity in the World to come be added to the purchase, who
would not save themselves from Everlasting Anguish?
Ibid, page iv-“If you should receive any Benefit by
these my Labours, remember that you give unto God all
the great Praise, Honour, and Glory of the same.”
He forgot to add—But to me the MoMEY!
Page 6—“I myself cannot place confidence in the vain
Opinions of Men, any further than what is found to be
consistent with Plain, Known, and Solid Truths.”
Can he then wonder that I and others place no Confi
48 ECCE HOMO !
dence in His vain Opinions?—Opinions which have neither
Plain, Known, nor Solid Truths to substantiate them.
Page 8—“Abstain from all impure, vain, obscene, and
unprofitable Conversation, at all times.”
“Do as I SAY, not as I Do!”
Page 16—“Gentlemen Soldiers, let me now entreat
you, for your Own Sakes, to well examine yourselves, be
fore you go into the Field of Battle, and see whether you
are on the Lord’s side or otherwise ; and you have a Mon
itor within you, that will give each of you a proper Answer
to this most Important Question. If you are not on the
Lord's Side, you may justly expect to be delivered up as a
prey into the hands of your Enemies; that is to say, in
such a case, you need not expect any other, than either to
Fall in the Battle, or at the best, to be taken Prisoner and
Defeated.”
I rather think, that in the Field of Battle, if those Sol
diers who fancied themselves not “on the Lord's side,” were
to Refuse to Fight, they would stand as great, or a greater
chance of falling by the Hand of the Executioner, than by
the Ball of an Enemy. And I am very doubtful whether
this Persuasion to the Contempt of Orders, is not very Oppo
site to the Articles of War; and whether the Doctor is not
Punishable, by Military Law, for his Courageous Advice.
The “System herein laid down” is, that every Soldier
should wear and use a Holy Consecrated Lamen, for which
the Doctor must be paid One Guinea each; and allowing him
his wishes, in every British Soldier purchasing a Lamen, it
would bring to him, at a moderate calculation, the sum of
48100,000! a pretty Comfortable Independency.—But what
an Unfeeling Being he must be, to suffer the Fell Sword to
Drench in BRITISH BLooD, and the Tremendous Bolts of
War to Mow Down Thousands of his BRAVE CountRYMEN,
when He, by a Word, could have Commanded his Celestial
ECCE HOMO ! 49
Agents to Desist from their Work of Death, and Turn their
Annihilating Weapons on His Country’s FoEs!
Witness the Signing and Delivery:
“This Work Corrected, Revised, Signed, and Deliver

erby, near Grantham, Lincolnshire, on Friday, January
1st, 1819, by
The GRAND AMBAss4DoR of HEAVEN ?”
His appended Texts stand in the place of what the Law
yers term the Attestation. The formality of Labelling and
Sealing, it seems, was not considered necessary.
2 Cor. v. 20–Now then we are Ambassadors for
Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you
in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.
Zach. iii. 7–Thus saith the Lord of Hosts: If thou
will walk in my ways, and ifthou wilt keep my charge, then
thou shalt also judge my house, and shall also keep my courts,
and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand
by.
Rev. ii. 17—He that hath an ear, let him hear what the
Spirit saith unto the Churches: To him that overcometh
will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a
white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no
man knoweth, saving he that receiveth it.
How substantiatory of the Doctor's Heavenly Power!—
Query—Could not he procure a slip of paper to be printed,
and appended to the Testament thus: “Erratum—Rev. ii.
17—For ‘To him that overcometh,’ &c. read, ‘To him that
hath Money, I will sell a Holy Lamen, and in the Lamen
shall be written, DOCTOR PARKINS; and the Lamen
shall Work MIRACLEs, and shall cause the Wearer to See my
Face, and to Enter into my Joy?’”—This would be a mas

Perhaps the Reader will be quite satisfied with the selec
tions above given. One thing more however must be noticed,
before I close this “Celestial Treasury”—never, I hope, to
re-open it.
It is an Advertisement Leaf attached to, and forming a
part of, “The Warrior,”—a puff direct of “Our Grand
Holy Consecrated CELESTIAL ARCANUM, with our AMBR0
sIAN NecTAR, composed from the Primum Mobile of the
Celestial Regions, for the great Benefit of all those LADIES
who are above the Age of Eighteen Years; price One Guinea
each.”—The Weaker Vessel are again the objects of his al
tempts. The difficulty of persuading MEN, that “these most
fatal Occult Diseases, caused by the Possession of Evil
Spirits,” are so “very common and frequent to be found
amongst us, almost in every House and Family in every
Town in the Kingdom,” were too great not to beforeseen by
this Arch-hypocrite; and he, no doubt pre-instructed by the
success of his great Predecessor," chose, like him, to practice
upon the Weaker Sex. They are more susceptible in general,
when the Mind is depressed, or the Body in pain, to be mis
led by the Doctor's Insinuation that they are possessed by Evil
Spirits; and more likely, if that idea once take root, to give
him a kind Order for “Our Grand Holy Consecrated Celes
tial Arcanum, and Ambrosian Nectar.”—If it be allowable
for a Writer to recommend his Own; I would earnestly re
commend those who may have formed any wish to “make
one fair and impartial trial,” to re-peruse these pages: and I
am sure that those who know anything of the Doctor, know
too much to entertain such a wish for a moment.
He argues again too upon Astrological Influence:
“The Powers of Darkness are always ready to Ruin
-
* The Devil.
ECCE HOMO ! 51
and Destroy every Female, on whom they have gained any
power from their UNFortvNATE NATIVITIES," which
hath brought so many of them to the Commission of the
Worst of Deeds, which have taken them from thence to a
loathsome Prison, and from thence to the Gallows; while
others have been thus driven thereby to complete Despair,
Insanity, and Madness; so that they could not exist, but
have put an end to their most grievous sufferings in this
world by an untimely death, as the common Newspapers
doth prove and testify.”
I Deny, positively Deny, that Nativities can give Author
ity to the Powers of Darkness!—Nativities Cannot Influence
the Welfare of Mankind. They are no more the Harbingers
of Bliss or Misery, than Doctor Parkins is of the Millenium
of Christ; else what becomes of the Justice of the Almighty,
and where is the Free Will he has implanted in Man? Yet
it is upon this Foundation, and to prevent the Evils and Mis
eries occasioned by “Unfortunate Nativities,” that the Doctor
has mixed up his Ambrosian Nectar.—There is something to
induce one to believe him a Disciple of the Pagan Philoso
phers, and a Crediter of the Heathen Mythology. Jove, and
Apollo, and Minerva, and the rest of their Grecian and Ro
man Godships, were partial to Ambrosia and Nectar: and
the Doctor's Angelic Tribe must be equally so, for it would
be useless else to Daub a Person over with his Stuff to allure
them, and bind them in Servitude, unless that Stuff were to
them a Luxury. But the Ladies may really believe me when
I assert, that this Ambrosian Nectar will allure the Angels to
"The chief of what I can construe into the subject of Nativities
from the Scriptures, is this, that by nature “all are born under sin,”
and that “if ye live after the flesh ye shall die.” To avert which,
the unsophisticated Remedy is annexed—“But if ye through the
Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.” See Rom.
viii, throughout.-And the aid of this Prognosticating Doctor is as
little required to point out what those “deeds of the body” are, to
which all are naturally subject, as his Lamens, or Ambrosian Nec
tar, possess power and virtue to destroy them, or avert their conse
quences.

their Service, as much as, and no more than, the Scent of a
Tortoise-shell Tabby will draw around her an Assemblage of
fine plump Mice.
He does not conclude this Advertisement without afford
ing Another Proof of the Patriotism and Disinterestedness of
the Grand Ambassador of Heaven.—Read his own words:—
“If our beloved and much-lamented Illustrious Prin
cess Charlotte had but timely received the benefit of all
these great Celestial Treasures, together with Our Grand
Celestial Life Preserver, which is mentioned in my Book
of Miracles aforesaid; she would now have been still liv
ing amongst us at this day.” -
What an Abominable, Cold-blooded, Unfeeling Rascal!
The Life of that AMIABLE PRINCEss he declares he COULD
HAVE SAVED;—COULD, BUT WOULD NOT!–
HER, Beloved in Reality—HER, whom theNation looked to
as its Future QUEEN; and anticipated in her a Guardian
Angel in Earthly Shape—HER he Could have Saved, but
Would Not!—Reader an Innocent and Illustrious Victim
—an Afflicted People—a Nation's Hope—the Tears of Mil
lions, were incapable of Penetrating the Obdurate Bosom of
the Ambassador of an ALL-MERCIFUL GoD, because unac
companied by that Sordid Remuneration which alone can
Satiate his Avarice, and Induce him to Dispense those Boum
ties our Blessed SAviouR taught us were to be purchased
without money and without price.—How striking the Contrast
between the AMBAssADoR and the SoN !—“Come unto me,”
says one, “all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
give you rest.” “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to
the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and
eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk witHouT MonEY AND
witHouT PRICE.” And “Ask, and receive, that your joy
may be full.”—“Come not unto me,” says the other, “unless
your Pockers CHINK witH GUINEAs, and your Credulity
ECCE HOMO ! 53
prompt you to dispense them; for GOLD is the Idol I Wor
ship; and unless you will Sacrifice, and that largely too, at
the Shrine of my Idolatry, I will laugh at your calamity, and
mock when your fear cometh.”
If it were possible to Believe the Doctor capable of
Preserving the Life of this ILLUSTRIoUs PRINCEss, as he
Pretends he was, I should consider the Punishment of
DAMIEN as Mercy inflicted upon him.
The Reader is doubtless by this time convinced what kind
of man Doctor Parkins is, and how far consonant his Publi
cations are with Truth; yet it would be a pity to lose the
Beauties of the one I have now before me: a Book, in the
Doctor's Estimation, “most profitable and curious;” if utili
ty and curiosity are terms synonymous with Effrontery, I do
him the honour to believe him.

remember, that no order will ever be received or executed at

Ibid—“You can also thus profitably exercise all this

“Benevolence, Humanity, and Charity,” then, consist in
collecting for One's-self, “Seven or Eight Shillings per Day.”
Saint Paul does not give such a Definition; but he was only
an Apostle—the Doctor a GRAND AMBAssADoR!

This, Reader, is the Selfish Wretch's Method of Glori
fying God, and Answering the End of Man's Creation | | |
“[We shall first proceed to shew what is to be under
stood by Miracles, which is a supernatural operation per
formed by the power of God. Our Saviour confirmed the
doctrine which he taught by a train of incontestible Mir
acles, which were so great in their natures, so real and solid
in their proofs, so divine in their manner of performing
them by the power of his will, and so holy in their end, as
to fully confirm the doctrine he taught, so becoming the
wisdom and other glorious Attributes cf God, so that they
set forth his greatGlory. Real Miracles, which far exceed
all the power of Nature, can only be produced by a Cre
ating Power, and are wrought to give credit to those alone
who are sent of God;] yet some Ignorant Preachers, and
Others, have publicly declared, that the Power of Miracles
have wholly ceased since the days of our Saviour and his
Apostles, which said declaration I positively deny.”
The words inclosed in Brackets are no more the Doctor's
Writing than they are Mine. He has read, I dare say, on
Theological Subjects, a good deal; he is, (to give the Devil
his due) in some respects, a Shrewd Man; but so inveterately
addicted to Literary Thieving, that were it not for the pecu
liar Stiffness, and Law-like Formality of his style, a Casual
Reader would not easily discover how much of the Doctor's
Writings are really his Own. By incorporating, this way,
passages of our best Authors with his own, the Simple, who
know him only by his Pretensions, and are not withal so very
Learned as himself, are the more readily imposed upon.
I agree with him, that by Miracle we are to understand a
Supernatural Operation, performed by the Power of God.
And, (granting him Possession of his Stolen Paragraph,) that
Our Saviourproclaimed his Divinity by a Train of Incontest
ible Miracles. But what Synonyma there is between the
IN-contestible Miracles of Jesus Christ, and the rBRY con
ECCE HOMO ! 57
testible ones of Doctor Parkins, I have yet to diseover.
Perhaps I may emerge from this Maze of Darkness as I pro
ceed.
The First Miracle wrought by the Power of Lamenism,
was, to Compel an Eloped Wife to return to the arms of her
Dearly Beloved—a Tradesman of the Parish of Marston.—
This Runagate was no other than the Wife of the DocToR's
Own BRoTHER—the Blacksmith. Now it appears Remark
ably Strange, that as the Doctor KNEw there was an Opposi
tion of Saturn and the Moon, who are the Prime Significators
in his Nativity, which would Cause this Evil; and he kNEw
also, that the Malignancy of it might easily have been Pre
vented, Moved, and Eradicated, long before that time;—it
appears Remarkably Strange, I say, that he did not Prevent
such a Misfortune from befalling an only Brother. This argues
either his complete Pre-ignorance of the affair, in spite of all
his Foreknowledge, and Overthrows his Doctrine of Nativi
ties—or it implies a Total Want of Fraternal Affection, and
a Selfish Hankering after that MonEY, which is the God of his
Idolatry, and without which he will do Nothing. I believe,
indeed, that all these circumstances were combined, to allow
the Evil to take its course : for, as Nativities are altogether
Fallacious, they can Produce no Effect; and it is Impossible
to know any thing from a Science which in itself is Nothing.
—His Lack of Brotherly Feeling, and his Hankering after
Money, are sufficiently Evident, from his Avowal of having
charged the Poor Man a Guinea for his Lamen to restore her.
These Circumstances, I think, are of themselves sufficient to
Overturn the whole of his Pretensions to Miracle in this case;
and to Tumble into Ruins the False Fabric of his Darling
Lamenism. But there are others, which Prove, beyond doubt,
the Total Absence of Miracle. -
To constitute a Miracle, it is necessary that Natural
Means be not at all employed; but that the object in view be

Accomplished Solely by a Supernatural and Immediate In
terposition of Omnipotent Power; such as—Moses's Dividing
the Red Sea—the Rock Pouring out Water—Feeding the
Israelites with Manna in the Wilderness—The Restoration of
the Widow's Son—Christ's Feeding the Multitude with Five
Barley Loaves and Two Small Fishes—The Raising up of
Lazarus—The Conversion of Saul—The Striking Blind of
the Sorceror—the Universal Darkness at the Crucifixion, &c.
These were Miracles neither Assisted, nor to be Accounted
for, by Natural Means of any kind: they were evidently and
incontestibly the Sole Work of an Omnipotent Creator; and
the Method by which they were Performed, TotallyIncom
prehensible to the Human Mind. But in the Doctor's Case
of Elopement, Common, Intelligible, Natural Methods were
Publicly Resorted to—ADr.ERTIsEMENTs were even PRINT
ED in the NewsPAPERs; and this, too, by the Special Ad
vice of the very Man, who now solemnly declares her Return
to have been caused by his Lamen! One may very fairly
Infer, that the Doctor had, at that time, the same Opinion of
the Power of his Lamen, that I have always had, or he would
not have Advised his Brother to be at such Unnecessary
Expenses.
Let the Second Miracle be read in the Doctor's own Ac
count of it:
“Another Man came to me out of the Country, and
told me that his Wife had gone away, and had Eloped
with a Travelling Bookseller; he said, “he wished to have
her again, because she was such a very Pretty Creature,”
about TwentyYears Younger than him; so I also Sold
him one of these Articles, with a charge not to Destroy the
same, by which means she was also soon Obliged to Re
turn Home again; but when hefound this Lamen had done
its Work, he Destroyed the same, and the Consequence
was, she soon Left him again, and I suppose his Friends
advised him to give himself-ao more trouble about her.”
ECCE HOMO! 59
It strikes me, that that there is nothing more Miraculous
here, than in the Restoration of his Brother's Wife. That a
Woman should Return to her Husband after having once
Eloped, is nothing of the Marvellous, because such Instances
often occur: and it is no more Wonderful that the Circum
stances which induced her to Leave Home at First, should
again exist, and produce the Same Effect.
The Third Miracle was on behalf of a Weak-headed
Lincolnshire Swain, who “fell desperately in Love with a
Farmer's Daughter;” and after asking the “Plain Question,”
received as Plain a Denial.—Post haste comes a Letter and a
Guinea to the Doctor, who in return transmits him a Lamen.
This Lamen effects a Wonderful Change in the Sentiments of
the Fair One, and she actually at his next visit, received him
with Open Arms So far, so good; but oh, dire mishap !
the Brain-turned Lover made Sure of his Prize, and Destroyed
the Cabalistic Treasure! The Army of Heaven Forsake
him—the Lady again Rejects him—he is “now Reduced to
the most Miserable and Unhappy State and Condition:” he
writes again to the Doctor, (not forgetting the Guinea,) and
obtains another Lamen: the Lady's Affections Revive—be
hold, they are Married ! Such is the Doctor's Tale; which
in the Recital, occupies nearly Four closely-printed Pages.—
Yet I can see nothing in it substantiatory of his Miraculous
Power; though he exultingly asks in Italics, “Don’tyou call
this a Miracle?” The Story, even as he tells it, evinces no
thing more than the Flirting Coquetry of a Silly Young
Country Girl, and the Paucity of Intellect of a Lincolnshire
Northernman.
We now come to the Miracle on which he appears to lay
the Greatest Stress; not only in his Writings, but in his Pri
vate Conversations. At Louth and its Neighbourhood, his
Tale. I believe is partially, if not generally Credited: and the
Doctor is there looked upon as an object of Dread, by some;
l
60 ECCE HOMO !
and of Wonder and Admiration, by others. He takes the
Credit, or the Infamy, of Murdering a Female, not even Sus
pected of Crime; and upon whom, even if found Guilty by
a Jury, the Laws of England would have Paused, ere they
had Inflicted the Punishment of DEATH.—Let him, however,
Tell the Story his Own Way; then he shall have it Mine.—
“A certain Tradesman who lives about Fifty Miles
from my Residence, came to my House some time since,
and informed me that he had been Robbed of a Black Bill
Case, containing Bank of England and Provincial Notes,
to the amount of £48 or £50, and produced a Hand-bill
offering 10 Guineas Reward, for the regainment of his
Property, or for the Discovery of the Thief—This said
Tradesman then desired to have some of my Holy Conse
crated Lamens, in order to Prosecute this Offender in Our
Celestial Court of Justice; for which purpose, I Made him
the same, and he took these Articles with him, which, I
suppose, was used by some of his Family, according to
Directions; for sometimes the Thief or Offenders will
come forward at First, as soon as they find any thing the
matter with them, while at another time, they will be Ob
stinate and Stand it Out to the Last Extremity, and so it
was in the Present Case, for we never could have had a
more Obstinate Offender than this was, at any time whatso
ever; she seemed more inclined to give up the Ghost rather
than Confess: but this was more than she was able to do,
for I believe she would have lived while now, if she had
not caused me to receive some satisfaction in regard to this
matter, for the Thief can Never die while the Angelic Min
isters of Heaven, who do all my work, are Perfectly Satis
fied; but it was so long before she would give the least hint
of this nature, that the Plaintiff grew Impatient, and sent
me a Most Infamous Letter, written, I suppose, by some
Wiseacre, who was much better versed in the Art of Scur
ility than he was in Law; and who may think himself For
tunate that he came off with a Whole Skin and escaped
Flogging; to which I returned an immediate answer by
return of Post, which so far Cured him the First Time
Dressing, that I have not been Favoured with any more of
ECCE HOMO ! . G1
his Ignorant Epistles ever since that period, (as it seems he
Preferred Life rather than to Suffer Death by MY Superior
Law,) which was such a Reflection upon the Attorney,
and such a Complete Disgrace to his Profession, that I shall
not give it any place in this Book.”
I would have the Language of the Latter part of this pas
sage particularly taken notice of A Gentleman of the Pro
fession of the Law, and I may add, too, an Ornament to the
Profession, is the Subject of the Doctor's Ribaldry. I with
hold his Name from Motives which have Great Weight with
me, and can be of no moment to the Public. If that Gen
tleman has seen this Beautiful Paragraph, I can only account
for his Non-prosecution of the Doctor as a Libeller, or his
Forbearance to bring him to Justice for the Threat upon his
Life, on the ground, that he considers him too Contemptible
or too Crazy-brained, to interfere with. -
—“I had, of course, given up all the thoughts of ever
hearing from them again, until I received the following
Letter by the post, last February.
[Extract.]—* * * * * “This person, (who is very
near to me,) is troubled in a manner that she can neither eat,
drink, nor sleep, nor get any rest by day or night. What
can be the consequence of this, God only knows. We are
greatly apprehensive she is Guilty of the Lost Property I
sustained, which I made known to you when I was at your
house. Should her Affliction be occasioned from your
Exertionsfor the Recovery of the same, we should be very
glad to know, as you certainly are the only person to whom
we can apply for this Information. * * * * The suf
ferings which she at this present time labours under, is
inexpressible. Should this be the case, and could be re
moved by any means of your's, we certainly should feel
uncommonly desirous; for to see her in such a Suffering
State on that account, is most Shocking. Do have the
goodness to write me word whether it be the reason or not,
as we are out of all patience to know. * * * *
Here the Doctor can complain of no unfairness; for I
G
|
62 ECCE HOMO !
have given him full liberty of speech: all the foregoing Ex
tracts are made from his own publications; and nothing is left
out butthe verbose repetitions he so profusely makes use of.
The “Plain Unvarnished Tale” is this:—Mr. Howe, a re
spectable Tradesman, of Louth, shortly after his second mar
riage, missed the sum of money in question out of his pocket.
Being rather a Weak Man, and having no clue to discover
the Thief, he applied to an Astrologer at Louth, for informa
tion. The Rules of Simple Astrology, however, were not
sufficient to give the desired intelligence; and the Doctor was
applied to, to Enter an Action in his Celestial Court, and to
Punish the Unknown Offender. Now it is no very Remark
able Coincidence, that the Wife of Mr. Howe should at that
time be confined to her chamber, giving birth to her First
Child, nor that she should, in consequence, be reduced to the
State spoken of in the letter: nor is it more extraordinary that
She should die in Childbirth, than that the Princess Charlotte
and Ten Thousand other Females have done before her.—
At that period, Women are Particularly Susceptible to the
Effects of Imagination: Mrs. Howe, for aught any one can
tell, might have taken the Money: she must have been well
informed of the steps her husband had taken: and might not
the Simple idea, working upon her already-depressed Spirits,
of the Probability of her being Detected, lead to the very
event so much boasted of by the Doctor—her Death. And
it is no despicable negative evidence, that nothing like Confes
sion of the Crime was ever made, or perhaps thought of, by
Mrs. H. At any rate, there is nothing at all in this case to
warrant the belief of Miracle. The coincidence of Mrs.
H.’s decease with the time of purchasing the Lamen, affords
not the least Proof. But as the Poor Lady is no more, the
Doctor conceives he has sufficient room to establish the Pow
erful Authority he possesses over the Ministers of Heaven,
and to Boast, as he does, in conversation,—“I killed her!”
Before I have done with this Miracle, I feel it incumbent
ECCE HOMO ! 63
upon me to offer my opinion more fully, and to make such
further observations as appear to be Warrantable, and even Ne
cessary.
The Doctor is particularly Fond of mentioning this Mir
acle in his Common, Every-day Talk, and feels himself Much
Offended if his hearer will not believe “HE killed her '”
I should not have noticed his Merely Talking of this, but as
he has Published it, and lays a great deal of Stress upon it,
I think I have every right to make My observations. Allow
him then the Credit, in its utmost latitude, of being the Cause
of Mrs. Howe's Death—allow him to have the Power of
afflicting others “by the Rules of Art;” I come to this con
clusion :
Mrs. Howe was, in the eye of the Law, and for ought
any one can disprove, PERFECTLY INNocENT:—if Suspicion
attached, the Law was Open; and by that Law only she
should have been tried; and when Found Guilty, punished.
But as it is, the Doctor has acted as JUDGE, JURY, and
ExECUTIONER. According to his account, it was through
His Charms she died; and if I am to Believe His Tale,
I Insist and Maintain, that this Woman's Blood is on his
Head; that he is to all Intents and Purposes, a MURDERER!
and he ought, as such, to be arraigned, tried, convicted, and
executed!—I repeat it—if his Own Account is to be credited,
he is, bona fide, Mrs. Howe's MURDERER! . It is plain he
employed “Charms and Enchantments” to effect it, and the
Punishment for this is—DEATH !
But as I totally Disbelieve his being the Cause of her Dis.
solution, I should not like to see him thus Arraigned. Let
his own Conscience, if he have one, be his Punishment.
The next Miracle on the List, is Saving a Flock of Sheep
in Northamptonshire, from “Diseasesand Unnatural Death,by
the Rules of Art.”—Because the Proprietor was Fool enough
to Buy a Lamen, and his Sheep were no more afflicted than
|
64 ECCE HOMO !
his Neighbours', the Doctor takes the Liberty to say, “I saved
them”! and “Don’t you call this a Miracle?”—If these Sheep
had all Died, and the Doctor had Restored them to Life, I
should have readily acknowledged it Miraculous: but the
Tale, as it now stands, is Idle and Contemptible.
Then he prates a great deal about Ploughshares, and
Coulters, and Swaytrees, and Gears being Stolen, and after
wards Recovered by “the Rules of Art.”—Aye, and more
than that, he “made an Old Cow Dance a Hornpipe!”—
Heye dyddelle dyddell,
Yekatte and ye fythelle,
Ye Kowe ivmpt ouer ye moune;
Ye lyttell dogge laught
Toese syche craffte,
And ye dyshe runne avvaie vvythe ye spoone.

“The Sports of Children Satisfy the Child!”
In page 40, we have a repetition of his “Universal Chal
lenge to the Learned,” but with this addition, that whoever
shall “Confute, Defeat, or prove to be False and Erroneous,
any Article, Subject, Matter, or Thing in this Book,” shall
not only receive “the Silver Cup,” but “a Good and Bene
ficial FLAGELLATION into the Bargain, without Respect to
Persons, Dignities, Rank, or Titles, whatsoever!”-Oh dear,
oh dear—Englishmen take Care of your BUMs!
“God save the King and defend this Nation.”
Why so say I: but I believe the Doctor would as rea
dily Execrate both King and Nation if he could sell a Lamen
by it.

ECCE HOMO ! 65
There are two or three other “Miracles,” as he calls them,
afterwards enumerated, so nearly allied to those I have given
account of, that it is quite supererogatory to dwell upon them.
One is a second edition of the Cattle-saving Story; another
the Recovery of a Sick Man by the united powers of Physic
and Magic; the third regards his Own Son;—but by the bye
let us look at this last more particularly.
“Some time since, my Son lived with a Surgeon at Na
venby, which is about seventeen miles distant from me, who
had the misfortune to be thrown from a Horse, on June 7,
1813, who then pitched on his Head, which bled inwardly;
the consequence of which, was this, that he was most griev
ously afflicted by strong and violent Fits, which commenced
with one Fit in two or three days, and then afterwards in
creased to one and often two in a day, when he required
three stout men to hold him for about two hours at each
time. This most grievous and most dreadful intelligence
was brought to me by the following LETTER” written by
my Son.
[Extract.]—" * * * * “Having rode down the
street a little way, I felt very low in my spirits, and also
very dizzy, that I fell from the horse; after which, I got
up again, and felt myself something better, and after having
mounted again, the horse took fright, and gallopped a
way as fast as his legs could carry him; I having nothing
but a snaffle bridle on, I could not stop him, the faster I
tried to hold him, the faster he went. I rode very well
while I came to Wellingore mill, where the horse threw
me off, but whereabouts I cannot tell; I pitched upon my
head, having no hat on, which made me quite insensible.
* * * * A neighbour came to meet me, but I did not
know him; he asked me some questions, but I answered
him in a state of insensibility; he took me to my master's,
who told him to take me to my uncle's house, and he would
come to me there himself; he accordingly came, and Took
* Another sample of his Knowledge of All Things Past, Pres
ent, and To Come!
G 2
66 ECCE HOMO !
THREE PARTs of A BASIN of BLooD Away FROM ME. This
happened about two o'clock in the afternoon. * * * *
I remain your dutiful Son,
J. PARKINS.”
The words printed in Capitals are rather emphatical: in
asmuch as they completely overturn the idea of Miracle. The
three parts of a basin of blood being taken away, was, as the
Lad's Master was aware of, the Ground of his Recovery.
And the Tale of the Power of the Lamen is nothing better
than the Tale of a Tub.
A few more words may not be altogether superfluous.
He “knows,” he Says, “All Things Past, Present, and To
Come.” Of course, then, he Must have been Acquainted
with this accident Antecedently.—And he can “Remove and
Prevent All the Accidents and Miseries of this life;” why
then, I ask, did he allow his Only Child to be thus “most
Grievously Afflicted,” and Himself, on that account, to
“Dread the return of every day?” What can speak Plainer
than this the Fallacy of the Doctor's Pretentions.—Verily
“out of thine Own Mouth will I Condemn thee!”
—“I suppose this to be as Great a Miracle as ever I
Performed.”
Why I suppose so too: but I remember that in 1817,
when many of the Working Classes were reduced to a state
of Starvation, that he was recommended by a Friend of mine,
(to whom he was Largely Expatiating upon the Greatness of
his Power) to Turn the CRoss, in Graptham Market Place,
into BREAD-LoAves, and distribute them to the Poor.—This
would have been a greater Miracle than the one he considers
his Chef d’OEuvre: at all events it would have established,
beyond a doubt, that he was no Impostor; and would have
brought upon his head the Prayers and the Blessings of Man
kind.—But as my Friend happened to be as Poor in Pocket
ECCE HOMO ! 67
as in Faith, and could neither afford to pay him a Guinea for
his trouble, nor compel himself to think the Doctor “a Holy
Man of God,” the Doctor would not take the Hint, and the
Cross still remains in its old situation; the Stones of which it
is composed are as Hard and as Unfit for Food as ever.
Query—If the Overseers of the Poor were to Bribe him
to Feed the Paupers, as Christ did the Multitude with five
barley loaves and two small fishes, daily, would it not tend
very much to Diminish the Poor-RATEs? This surely would
be no very Hard Task to an Ambassador of Heaven, who has
the Power to set Old Cows a-Dancing.
“We also read, and are informed by the Holy Scrip
tures, that there are diseases caused by the possession of
Evil or Unclean Spirits; Matt. xii. 43, 45; from whence
cometh also, diseases by Witchcraft, which have often ter
minated in Death.”
I do not recollect to have ever read in Scripture, or any
where else, except the Danonologie of King James, and Bax
ter's Certainty of the World of Spirits, that Witchcraft has
ever caused diseases which terminated in Death. Indeed I
am rather inclined to doubt with the more enlightened part of
mankind, the Existence of Witches and Witchcraft at all,—
at least in the sense the Doctor represents it.
But the testimony of the Bible, as to the Witch of Endor,
is certainly conclusive evidence that there have been such ;
and perhaps there may be now—I cannot tell: such instances
are very, very rare; and in all the cases I have heard of, the
circumstances, whes candidly and liberally looked into, have
always ended in a conviction, that no such charge was genuine.
It may be objected, that the Great, the Virtuous, the Pious
JUDGE HALE condemned some poor Wretches to the Gallows
for this Crime. I admit it. But it should be remembered,
that he Himself was not altogether convinced that the Prison
l
68 ECCE HOMO !
ers were Guilty, or that they could be Guilty.—His Lordship
was so much affected, he could not even sum up the Evidence,
but left it, as he emphatically said, “to GoD and to the JURF.”
Supposing, however, he had been well convinced that the
Prisoners were Witches and Wizards;—still—he was only
Human; susceptible as other men to Error: and who can say
that this great man might not for Once be Wrong? When
He expressed his Doubts, Who is to Decide? -
I have no objection, however, to Concede all my Stoicism,
and to allow, for once, the Whole Truth of the Doctrine of
Witches and their Craft: but against the Power of Doctor
Parkins to Thwart or Exterminate them, I Solemnly Protest.
God Almighty declares the Love of Money to be the Root of
all Evil; and I think it very Unlikely He should endow a
Man like This with Supernatural Ability, for the purpose of
enabling him to Gratify his Voracious Appetite for Gold.—
As to his compelling Witches and Wizards to appear, in Pro
pria Persona, at the Temple of Wisdom, and Fighting him,
“Power against Power—Art against Art—and Life against
Life”—the Story might not be a bad one for MotherGoose's
Tales, or it will do very well to Frighten Superannuated Old
Women and Four-year-old Children; but it will hardly pass
current in a Country that Boasts of its Enlightenment in the
Nineteenth Century.
I have now given plenty of Samples of the Wisdom, Ho
liness, and Cleverness of this Self-dubbed Doctor.—To the
Liberal and Enlightened, I think they are quite Sufficient;—
and to others—let them Read his Publications as Attentively
as I have done, and Believe him if they Choose.
CONCLUSION.
-
IN taking a retrospectiveglance over the contents of these
pages, before I finally consign them to the Printer,-I feel a
gratification in declaring, that I have found no passage I wish
to Expunge, no Sentiment to Suppress, nor no Epithet I do
not think Deservedly Applied. The Language, in some
places, may perhaps be considered rather too Severe: but it is
a subject which calls for Severity. While, however, I totally
disavow the intention to LIBEL, I conceive it cannot be Li
bellous to Reprimand him who is every day Libelling his
MAKER. -
The first step Parkins made towards his present height
of Blasphemy and Imposture, was, to Dignify himself with
the Title of DOCTOR, and to commence Watercaster, As
trologer, and Fortuneteller; but he was then consulted only
by Silly Servant Girls, who wanted Sweethearts, and Brain
sick Lovers, pining after Maids. A temporary Suspension
being given to hispractice in 1810, at the Grantham Sessions,
he invented the System of Lamenism, or Spiritual Astrology,
in the hope of evading further interruption from the Law;
and by one Bold Stroke after another, arrived at his present
pitch of Worthless Popularity.
But, What are these Lamens? They are really Non-de
scriptive. A piece of Old Rag, sewed together at the ends
and sides, is the Charm. This is the Lamen ; and this he
avers is Consecrated by the Rules of his pretended Art, and
operates upon the Angelic Host, as a Powerful Talisman,
binding them into the Service of the Wearer, in like manner
70 ECCE HOMO !
as the Lamp of Alladin, in the Arabian Nights, did the Ge
riii. This Charm is accompanied by an Imprecatory Prayer,
to be read every hour; and without which it would be of no
effect. During the time the Wearer is Using his Lamen, he
must BELIEVE FERvENTLY in its power, and that the object
for which it was Consecrated will be Accomplished. FAITH
in its power is so Essential, that its Influence without it is en
tirely Lost.” Swearing, Lying, and every other sin, even in
Thought, is to be avoided. The Least Deviation from these
Directions is Fatal: the Lamen becomes Impotent, and the
Doctor has his Mousehole to creep out of
As a Writer, the Doctor ranks the Lowest of all Doggrell
Scribblers. The Stiff Formality of a Lawyer compasses the
whole variety of his Flowers of Literature. He is pretty
well versed, nevertheless, in the Art of Book-making. He
has said himself, that he could make a thick octavo volume to
elucidate the History of an Old Willow Tree, as well as one
that required Depth of Thought and Understanding and
I believe him.
I have observed before, that he is, of all others, the Gross
* A Mr. G—, of Westby, having Lost his Pocket-book, with
several Pounds in it, applied to the Doctor-paid a Guinea—and
received for it one of these bits of Old Rag and a Prayer. This
Mr. G. it should be known, is an ardent Admirer of Sir John Barley
corn. When he got home, for once in his life he summoned his whole
Family around him, and down went the Old Boy on his Marrow
bones—one Eye fixed upon the Paper, and the other sklenting at the
Door, expecting, no doubt, to see his Pocket-book and Pounds walk
in. The Neighbours were Paralyzed with Amazement at the Phae
nomenon, and fancied he had suddenly turned Methodist. This was
repeated till he grew weary of its repetition : and at last he went to
Remonstrate with the Doctor on its Ill Success. Why, says the Am
bassador, I see you haven't FAITH !— FAITH ! says G, what’s that 3
Oh, replies Parkins, be off! he that has not Faith, need not expect to

est of PragrarisTs. Any thing, whether Prose or Poetry,
that He fancies will chime in with his doctrine, and swell out
his Pamphlets, he Impudently quotes as his Own' conscious
that as his Books are only adapted for the Lower Classes of
Readers, his Pilferies are not very likely to be discovered.
Finally, I again Repeat, I have written these Remarks
solely as a Caution to the Public. I am well enough aware
they might have come from a much Better Pen: if any other
Man had written on this subject, I should still have remained
in Obscurity. But I have done to the best of my Ability: I
have made no Misquotations: I have wilfully Misrepresented
nothing. I conclude with the Hope, that Some may be ben
efitted by my Labours; and with the Assurance, that I am
no more anxious to Expose the Doctor as an Impostor, than
to Warn him to Turn from his Wickedness and Live.

been Overlooked by the Writer of the foregoing Sheets:–

“After I was first Created, and Lord of the Universe Crown'd,
I gave my Address to the Public, and took no less than a Pound:
Its Love, Law, Trade, and Physic, that's all my whole Delight,
