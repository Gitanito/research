so welcome back now everybody have a
nice journey understand the steps step
one the meditative faculty going into
quiet mind the breathing technique
mantra whatever is useful going into
deep silence Ness intending to see then
going and allowing your mind to know
affirming that it can know and see any
place it wishes and if you become
distracted or feel you&#39;re forcing it
stop the remote viewing process and just
go back to meditating and then allow it
to unfold again organically naturally
effortlessly and do this back and forth
now you can spend an hour doing this
obviously we&#39;re not gonna spend an hour
and as you do this begin to make a note
of how it felt when you got something
that was a perception and as I share
what it actually is because I live there
I know what it looks like we&#39;re not
reviewing over here in the Dark Side of
the Moon begin to pick note you want to
do a critical deconstruction of what you
got that was accurate and what wasn&#39;t
and well how did it feel when the
accurate part of the rewrote view was
coming and what were you doing when the
inaccurate when you got off the target
you see what I&#39;m saying so you want to
do a postgame wrap-up here you want to
do a review of it so you begin to learn
how your mind works and how your
consciousness operates because everyone
is different I want to point out that
some people will just know other people
will feel
some people actually see other people
who are very verbal will actually get
words and see words that describe it
it&#39;s all different because everyone is a
unique creation no to not even identical
twins are the same
not even clones so I have a twin sister
it&#39;s funny I had a PhD once asked me
does that mean you&#39;re identical and I
went well there&#39;s one tiny difference
we&#39;re not tiny anyway yeah okay I know
I&#39;m outrageous I like doing deep
consciousness spiritual things and then
put in something off-color and baldy so
it wakes people up I&#39;m not tiny so the
the house of so we&#39;re in the Blue Ridge
Mountains and we&#39;re about 20 miles west
of Charlottesville and University of
Virginia a little less as a crow flies
maybe 14 miles and these UFO goes and
it&#39;s about 65 acres and as you approach
the property there a set of black gates
that are electronically controlled to
control access obviously I mean I have
to live that way
and then as you come up the driveway if
there&#39;s a black paved driveway that
comes up and then it becomes that Brown
crushed a state stone it&#39;s really pretty
around the house and there&#39;s a circular
driveway in front the house is a
two-story Georgian with a third floor
with dormers and two wings off on either
side symmetrical and it&#39;s made out of
hand pressed brick so you see little
finger prints in it and then to the left
is a garage complex that&#39;s not attached
to the house and then the two doggies
the black there&#39;s a black female who is
named Rosie and she is they&#39;re both
rescues one is she is half pitbull and
half black lab and full of energy and
love and happiness all she wants to do
is sit in your lap and kiss you and lick
now she looked scary as a guard dog but
she Excel she wants to do is sit in your
lap and hug and kiss you all day and
then there&#39;s another dog who&#39;s quite old
he&#39;s about 15 years old that we rescued
and he&#39;s half Chow and half German
Shepherd very handsome face kind of
reddish brown and a kind of a mane much
longer fur but not real long but fluffy
cuz it&#39;s cold in Virginia now and he
fluffs up because they&#39;re outside dogs
and and the pit bulls very short-haired
black and just that the just sort of the
quintessence of loving loyalty and he is
very noble and loving and when you pet
him to give you an idea of his
personality if you stop he just puts one
paw on your shoulder very politely as if
to say please pet me some more now the
black lab pitbull female just Wiggles so
much she just jumps in yours she can&#39;t
control herself enjoy and happening
she&#39;s just burst with happiness so very
different personalities and if you went
into any one go into the house you I
mean yet my permission
I&#39;m is we have a lower level the vault
and then the first level and the the
central hall the marble floor and then
two as you go into the right is a living
room that has a desk where I work that
overlooks this hundred mile view of the
Blue Ridge beautiful and then a guest
wing in an office where my wife works
adjacent to the living room going west
and towards the view and then from the
center hall straight ahead is a library
which with cherry paneling with Ava&#39;s
Illya Noakes and then to the left of the
center hall is a dining room with a
altar in it and then and then adjacent
to that is a butler&#39;s pantry and a
kitchen with a really high ceiling great
big kitchen my wife likes to cook and I
was in the living room on the north side
which would be the entry side of the
main of the front end
which we never used we always come in
the kitchen door to the east as a an
altar Chinese altar where I keep the
puja and artifacts from all over the
world and things that have been given to
me from temples in Japan and all kinds
of things and the house is filled with
all kinds of eclectic sort of things
we&#39;ve collected over the years
and in the land going behind the house
there&#39;s there Meadows all around and on
the back as you&#39;re facing the house to
the going in and to the left there&#39;s a
giant solar array
it&#39;s the largest legal solar farm in
Virginia that runs the estate until I
get a ZPE that&#39;s the best you can do 15%
efficiency not great but we have it and
and then there woods and then there&#39;s a
clearing and a stream and a huge the
lower 40 and then another set of woods
and a hill and that&#39;s the we have about
65 acres there so I don&#39;t know how much
of that that clipped into your mind I
wanted to share quickly so did any
people how many people got some part of
that that seemed pretty accurate or
surprisingly accurate yeah you see about
half or two-thirds so when we do this in
a small group people go we go in a
circle and people share or you can
actually write it out on a piece of
paper and and then have it reviewed the
key thing to do also when you&#39;re doing
this at home you can do this at home is
to do is is to to go back and forth
sharing having different people share
things the others don&#39;t know but also
when the people begin to share go to
that person and hit listen without
judgment what they&#39;re saying and just
feel your truth ometer your truth meter
is this correct or not correct and then
continue to remote view even as they&#39;re
sharing you see what I mean so even the
checking in and checking out process
becomes an iterative back-and-forth way
of learning where you&#39;re continuing to
do the remote viewing and sensing an
intuitive awakening
does this make sense to folks yeah okay
so that&#39;s just one exercise there are
hundreds of approaches these are ones
that I found over the years are fun to
do I can&#39;t wait to get one of these
random number generator lamps or lights
so that we can put it in front and do it
and make it turn different colors and
that we&#39;re gonna be getting one of those
fairly soon and as a consciousness
assisted technology test but this is a
more sophisticated level because this is
actually what you&#39;re doing when you&#39;re
making contact with these interstellar
civilizations you&#39;re wanting to see
where they&#39;re from what planet is it
what does their spacecraft look like
what sector of space will they be coming
in from for example often we&#39;ll do this
as a team you know these week-long
expeditions which you know they&#39;re
limited now to about 25 people because I
used to live 60 people come out and it
was just such a too much for me to
handle and it was too hard to get
coherence and a team that big but when
now we&#39;re going out with just like 25
people and me and folks and you know if
you guys want to come just sign up for
one but you know they&#39;ve got to sign up
fast because usually they sign they fill
up in a couple days but we&#39;re going to
do one in Arizona in May and what I&#39;d
like for people to understand about this
is that when you&#39;re doing this at home
if you live in Vancouver or Japan or
Mexico wherever you&#39;re from you can do
the contact protocol before you go out
as a group so each individual member can
do the meditation tell the interstellar
ETS where you&#39;re going to be and when in
advance and then also however going to
sort of this quiet after you meditate
maybe lay down and go into hypnagogic
state that space between waking and
dreaming and ask them to show you how
they&#39;re going to show up what time and
where the first time we went to Mexico
to go to the volcano up up up up will
cut the petal I can never pronounce that
halfway decent I said I just got Popo
one time I gave a lecture in Mexico and
I was so embarrassed I&#39;m terrible with
this sort of thing I just would Popo go
grande boom and everyone understood
anyway
it&#39;s terrible my mother was a Spanish
translator - you think I would have
learned a little bit but I know I&#39;m
poquito ha solamente I always tell
people me s muy estupido me Madre s
professor espanol huh not my forte so
anyway I know Sanskrit and a few things
I don&#39;t know other languages very well
uh-huh that&#39;s why God created
translators anyway so when we were there
exactly seven days to the hour
adjusted for time zones I had a
meditation and saw this massive
transdimensional triangular craft coming
out of this volcano and I saw where we
were I saw I saw exactly what the
landscape was everything about it and so
when my team went there we spent the
first two days driving around little
towns and finally we ended up on the
other side of the volcano the first
night we were at a place and I kept I
was we were doing I and I kept getting
incorrect incorrect incorrect not here
incorrect and so we the next day we were
going through all these little towns and
the people were wonderful now the
federales robbed me they came at
gunpoint in broad daylight as soon as we
left the airport and took our passports
and all our money in the only way we got
we had to give them all our money to get
our passports back there&#39;s four in the
afternoon it was pretty scary so well
now I don&#39;t go anymore unless I have a
little secret service level with sag
wagons so you know protect but this is
the first time I went and that we were
going along and we finally find an
outside Puebla and then there&#39;s this
little town Mehta pick and then Utley my
Yahya is a little teeny village is like
at the end of the road before you get to
the jungle right the the volcano
this is 18,000 foot I believe one I
think it&#39;s the fourth
highest volcano in the world beautiful
and when we got there and there was a
field to outside utley Maya and when we
got there I said this is it
and that night interestingly in the the
week before the moon was in a certain
phase and that night it was in that
phase the stars were in a certain way it
was that crystal clear and accurate I
said this is where we have to be and
then this massive object comes out from
the volcano and floats towards us and
we&#39;re connecting to it and the beans on
board the commander that is connecting
and communicating with us telepathically
and all of our equipment is electronics
are going crazy we had a camera and the
camera just went full
electromagnetically just milled it down
shut down and it came around and it came
towards us and way so I had at that time
I didn&#39;t have these interesting lasers
so I just had these lights and I&#39;d
signal to it and it signaled back and it
came over and turned and then actually
went between Utley Mariah and down where
Puebla is and as it was going down and
went back into the earth it did one more
signal to us in sequence with what I was
signaling and and and the commander said
goodbye anyway
it was a beautiful now this all unfolded
I mean it&#39;s like something yeah be great
to do a full-length feature movie and in
Hollywood about the real things that
happen with Cee Phibes but that was all
pre cognitively seen in a lucid kind of
state after meditation it was actually
after sleep and in meditation going in
and out of that hypnagogic or hit Nepal
joke as a state the space between
dreaming waking and sleeping is that
relaxed state but and it just came in in
an instant absolute instant it didn&#39;t it
wasn&#39;t like it took afraid took a maybe
half a second for the whole packet of
vision to come
and then almost every time we&#39;ve had a
significant ce-5 has happened that way
you know you over heard of the Phoenix
lights have how many people have heard
of that the thing that most people you
know in 1997 the Phoenix lights event
happened in Phoenix all over Arizona
really and I was there when it happened
in March we were using a digital lab
that was actually tied into a covert
program but they were letting me use it
and a picture editor for the BBC was
flown in to help me put together this
reel of images I&#39;ve been showing you and
we were doing it to give to members of
Congress for the April 1997 briefings in
Washington that we were doing for
Congress and so while we&#39;re there while
I&#39;m flying in I&#39;m sitting in my seat and
I want a US Airways I called it us scare
ways flight in US Airways flight and
they&#39;re now part of American and we&#39;re
we&#39;re flying in and I decided to do the
CFI protocols and I was told to ask the
IDI so I asked the ETS to do something
while I was there that would be
unmistakable that we could get to put on
this real this video to give the members
of Congress that was at 5:30 p.m. at
8:30 p.m. the Phoenix lights happened as
a ce-5 it was a ce-5 and epicenter where
it was was right above the lab where I
was and this general this guy a former
general who worked for evergreen
transport a whole bunch of Spooks and
cutouts for the CIA came running in he
says boy what&#39;s going on out there any
tie said oh yeah I would and so it was
on the news that night you know although
in the Phoenix area now of course once I
shared this the UFO subculture covered
it up because they think you know it&#39;s
all you know you have you know it&#39;s like
the nuts and bolts crowd of UF ology
because they don&#39;t understand
interstellar spacecraft are
transdimensional and their craft and
everyone on board or wired into this
field of unbounded consciousness so they
don&#39;t want to hear
that there is a way to actually make
contact and and use these techniques
although they&#39;ll admit that the military
has remote viewing but we can&#39;t use it
it&#39;s like it&#39;s so it&#39;s so ridiculous
dysfunctional so this happened and it
was great because it ended up on the
news we put it on the real and we gave
it to all these members of Congress so
the Phoenix lights was an event that was
and I actually saw that event happening
that night three hours earlier it&#39;d be
interesting to see what a random number
generator would have done by the way
thousands of people saw this and dr.
kotahi was a friend of my also a medical
doctor filmed it two pictures of it and
later a couple hours later the Air Force
put up flares and said it was a National
Guard thing and and and Fife Symington
you know the the Governor of Arizona did
a press conference because there&#39;s so
many thousands of people who saw it and
had a ridiculous-looking aide come out
dressed up as an alien and made fun of
it later he admitted that he himself had
seen it and that he was very wrong to
have ridiculed it and covered it up and
we have him on video tape by the way
Michael that needs to be in this a movie
and so the feature made that movie was
coming out in six or seven months you
don&#39;t know about that
oh-ho boy it&#39;s gonna be a thousand times
bigger than serious so that is exactly
how you do it so you take these these
techniques that you&#39;re learning over
last night and today and apply it out in
your groups or by yourself for the
purpose of making contact but understand
that you can do it in real time under
the stars but you can also do it before
you even go out a week before a day
before a night before because if
consciousness and this as I say if it
has been proven that consciousness is a
non-local field that is omnipresent and
transcends the limits and boundaries of
space but also time and that&#39;s why you
can have a precognitive lucid dream or a
remote view of the future now let me a
caveat here
if it&#39;s not in the now or in the past
the past you can pull things from the
Akashic record and I&#39;ll define that what
I what the Kakashi ik record really is
in a moment but if if it&#39;s in the now it
can be verified if it&#39;s in the future
you can only speak a wise person will
only speak of probabilities now it may
be a 95% probability only a charlatan
and a idiot will say this is going to
happen you notice all the people make
predictions on October 12 the great
convergence and this is gonna happen it
never happens why because they don&#39;t
understand that by the time they
actually put that into the field of
consciousness there&#39;s enough that
happens that alters the timeline for
good or for ill that changes the event
horizon so when you&#39;re talking about the
future you can only talk of probable
futures so you have to temper it with a
scintilla of humility but also common
sense and reality if you&#39;re talking
about the now you can get very accurate
with the now and in the past you can
also be very accurate I have a military
advisor who in 1974 was read into that&#39;s
military spook speak for briefed read
into a project that was at the White
Oaks Naval facility it&#39;s now closed
where they had developed an electronic
device where it can go to any place like
this room and extract from the quote
white noise of space-time any speech
event action whatever that it ever
happened in that volume of space going
back a year a minute a decade a thousand
years a million years and this was an
electronic system naval intelligence
this 74 so this was about 42 years ago
and men have you all heard of this oh
well I mean this is I mean I live and
breathe and work with these
kind of folks all the time and it&#39;s not
a myth it&#39;s absolutely real
so electronics very advanced electric
transdimensional electronics our
taxpayer dollars hard at work I mean
remember there&#39;s trillions of dollars
and unacknowledged special access covert
programs that have gone into the study
of this so trillions not billions
there&#39;s a product 200 billion a year
going but if you add it up cumulatively
from the 50s till now you&#39;re really
talking unbelievable trillions you know
at least eight ten trillion dollars so
when when this is but but the point I&#39;m
making is that in consciousness if you
are adept at practicing meditation you
can also go to a place and feel and
sense what has happened in that place in
the past and you can connect to the
Native American peoples of this valley
you can now that let me bring in another
layer of high strangeness so Europe
we&#39;re out at Shasta a few years ago and
we&#39;re doing this protocol suddenly
weren&#39;t we have an interstellar
transdimensional object that comes in on
a carrier wave of a tone it&#39;s this is
crystalline tone that we record with a
bit you know bluesy was aim digital it
was a when these old tape recorders and
everyone in the circle heard it and when
they with their eyes closed we were in a
deep meditation is when I was taking
people into the deep God consciousness
Brahman consciousness state it came in
but everyone saw the spacecraft which is
this pearlescent shimmering sphere that
came from one side of the National
Forest through the center of the circle
out the other end you&#39;re gonna see some
of these pictures tonight oh not that so
shortly after that we were on such a
deep state of consciousness that we
opened up a
time snap a bubble in the area in that
forest that allowed us to perceive and
brought into that dimension that place
physical 3d were sitting on the dirt or
on the ground in this National Forest
and suddenly there&#39;s a and there&#39;s an
ancient pre Homo Sapien humanoid that
pre-existed in in the order of many tens
of millions of years ago in that area
that appeared and then disappeared in
the east field to our east not ET and
not human but it just came in a my
stretching things too far are you
following ok so I know it sounds like a
science fiction movie but the strangest
things are true and everyone heard that
and with oh my god and then it went on
from there a week under the stars doing
this you cannot imagine what happens you
cannot I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s beyond people
how many people have been on one of
those week long expeditions you know
grab one of them and just tell them to
ask them so that that&#39;s exactly what you
want to be able to do with your your own
contact team practice these techniques
go out and do it with a few people
practice the remote viewing every day
every minute of every day be in a
mindful state develop at least twice to
three times a day
this practice of deep quiet meditation
remote viewing practice and you&#39;ll be
stunned at how quickly you advance and
how much it can then be used to create
peaceful interstellar contact so these
Sciences that are based in consciousness
and the knowledge of the true structure
of the multiverse we live in the
transdimensional universe we live in is
the foundation for contact and being an
ambassador to these civilizations
you
