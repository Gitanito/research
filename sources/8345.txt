  		              		Experience Description   

    Hello everybody, I want to tell you something that happened to me that I have  never told anyone before: 

  On March 29, 2007, I crashed at 180 km/hr (almost 112 m/hr) against another car.  I was into a coma with  twenty fractures of which three to my skull, both arms destroyed, pneumothorax, and two-thirds of my liver was destroyed. 

  Suddenly, I felt good. There was light and I was at peace.  I saw myself from above my body. I  soared about two or three meters, and then I found myself in a room.  I can see no walls, only a low and light ceiling. I am very fine. I then saw a man in a nice gray suit who was lying on a bench. He gots up and  turned around.  It was  my grandfather who died twenty years earlier who  I adored! When he was alive, Grandpa showed his illness with odd behaviours like sleeping on benches for whole nights while he was vacationing in Rimini.  He moved closer to me and in a Northern Italian dialect, he looks at me angrily  and said, 'What are you doing here, kid? AWAY!' Then a man from behind a reading stand called me and beckoned me  closer.  He looked at me and said, 'It's not time,  you have a second occasion.'

   After a few days, I woke  up from my coma. I tell my dream to my mother who confesses to me that she dreamed the same scene. Yet, when she asked grandpa who I was, he answered "Never mind, that's somebody coming from Rome; but he doesn't live here...' I was living in Rome at the time.
