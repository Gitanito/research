we&#39;re sitting out in the desert in the
middle of an 800,000 acre park there are
no police around there&#39;s no microwaves
there no
McDonald&#39;s um um there no big microwave
ovens and we have magnetic field meters
and radar detectors and other things
that aren&#39;t expensive but that we have
in our our toolkit and we&#39;re sitting
there and we&#39;ll see an object it will
look like
a a flash bulb going off in space it&#39;s
just an object that turns on and turns
off and sometimes it&#39;ll move and turn on
and turn off and one time we had like 15
of of them that were right above us
doing this that we
filmed this actor actually came out with
us in near Palm Springs and we did this
and then the detectors start talking but
they&#39;re making sounds that the people if
you contact the people who manufacture
at the factory go these don&#39;t make these
sounds and they&#39;re actually doing
transdimensional communication through
the electronics so forget the aasbo
telescopes and the seti project spending
hundreds of millions of dollars
you can go to Radio Shack get a radar
detector a magnetic field meter trifield
meter and a couple other things put that
out sit in meditative State and then
welcome them to come and all kinds of
things can start
happening and what is what is it how do
you interpret that though it becomes
very intuitive because uh and what you
what we have found with some of our
equipment certain things will make
certain tones like we have one radar
detector we call Walter go was a man
named Walter gave gave it gave it to us
and it will do a certain type of beeping
it&#39;ll beep beep beep three times and
only three times doesn&#39;t make the sound
like you would with a rad with a cop car
or or radar gun just when an object is
about to appear and then within moments
there&#39;ll be a sighting of a an ET object
it beep beep beep and it means we are
here um and so it gets you get into this
flow and they actually do what I call a
uh transdimensional entrainment of the
circuitry of your device it gets
customized after a period of weeks and
months
years and they really will communicate
uh in ways that are quite mysterious
quite bizarre people who come on these
whole week thing Expeditions with me
they you know they go what the hell is
going on I said well just listen and
interpret for yourself but there&#39;s a but
there is a pattern to it that evolves so
you have objects that can materialize
objects that can be quasi
materialized that are like the cobalt
blue object at that Air Force Base you
can have spherical objects that will
have the entities in them you can have
an object that appears and then
dematerializes and then all you hear is
some voices speaking you take a
photograph and there&#39;s this guy waving
at you this is why is wsfm Weird Science
and freaking magic and everyone is
oriented toward wordss very
materialistic
linear early 21st century manifestations
because that&#39;s what we want and I&#39;m
saying what a mistake that&#39;s a huge
mistake because what they&#39;re really
wanting us to do is to understand their
Universe their Cosmos and go partially
into
that because it&#39;s edifying that&#39;s how
you learn you don&#39;t learn by having
everything spoonfed you at the level
that you&#39;re already
operating does this make
sense hard lesson because people are
lazy and humans tend to
be kind of
slovenly mentally was a yoga nand that
said it&#39;s the lack of spiritual
adventuresomeness
that keeps Humanity back um so there&#39;s a
sense of adventuresomeness and
exploration and and and these
civilizations understand that we need to
be kind of willing to step while we&#39;re
in this planet and in this Dimension
step partially into their understanding
of what it&#39;s like on their
planet where using thought to interface
with an electronic device is as common a
thing as we would be texting someone
with our cell phones but remember a few
hundred years ago in Salem Massachusetts
if you had a a smartphone you&#39;d be
burned at the stake as a witch it&#39;d be
witchcraft it&#39;d be magic so that&#39;s why
you know if we&#39;re really looking at this
instead of Looking Backward if we want
to look forward into where our
civilization&#39;s headed we need to take
these lessons to heart and begin to
practice it within that
Paradigm and that&#39;s what we&#39;re
encouraging people to do through these
C5 Close Encounters of the fifth kind
teams it&#39;s very very exciting because as
you begin there we have an app um that&#39;s
at the
uh app stores is for both U iPhones and
also Google um that you can get that has
the whole meditation technique it&#39;ll
actually turn your phone into a magnetic
field meter it does all this stuff it&#39;s
a whole course it&#39;s a huge file you have
to use your computer to download it so
big but um I encourage people to get
that we have people who&#39;ve done that
gotten that in if you were in all kinds
of remote areas of the world uh and that
now that&#39;s separate from the the app the
free app that lets you network with
people in your area that&#39;s the ET
contact networking app this is the
training app and but it&#39;s only like $699
and it has like a zillion things in
there for and I encourage people to get
that because if you can&#39;t come on a
whole week Expedition with me and those
are limited to 20 people so let&#39;s face
it not many people can but you can get
that practice it find some people in
your area and go out and begin to do it
and when you go out and begin to
practice it then you realize wow this
works and people people I we&#39;ve heard
from so many people go out and try it
and they go we had an amazing object we
had amazing sighting we had this thing
come right into the field with us uh and
and the reason it works is that it&#39;s so
simple because the Simplicity of it even
though what I&#39;m giving you is more of a
deeper theoretical and physics
understanding of it everyone&#39;s
conscious right well let&#39;s you&#39;re
coma and everyone can think and so if
you are sentient if you have the ability
to be aware and awake you can become
aware of
awareness and in that self-aware state
you can go into the Silence of Deep
Quiet
mind and in that
state begin
to remote View and see distant places
including where the ET craft are and
they may be under under the ground
underneath you they may be transposed in
the air around you they may be on the
far side of Saturn doesn&#39;t matter where
they are because there&#39;s no limitation
in space when you go into thought
Consciousness that goes beyond SpaceTime
so that&#39;s where the the meditative state
is so key and if you begin to understand
what&#39;s F you know there&#39;s this wonderful
saying from the I think it&#39;s a Sufi
tradition think it&#39;s thyself a puny form
when within Thee the universe is folded
it&#39;s a rhetorical
question so we think of ourselves as
just these little animals running around
but the truth is
every conscious being has the ability to
be aware of the awareness itself and
from that point explore anywhere and
travel anywhere see any
place and you know human history is
replete with people whove had these
experiences many times quite
spontaneously I think almost everyone
has had how many people here have had a
precognitive or an intuitive uh
experience of something that then
happened in their life at some point
yeah I met my wife that way in a lucid
dream and I think that what you find I
really did and and but what you find is
that this is something that is innate to
every human being it&#39;s not like you have
to be um well this guy I knew for years
Ingo swan SW you know who ingos Swan is
very famous remote viewer did a lot of
stuff for the intelligence Community
Live to regret it but I was at his home
up in New York um some years ago and um
just a wonderful man brilliant you know
he did a lot of work with SRI Stanford
research
international um and DARPA and um Army
intelligence and CIA and they were
experimenting and training people during
the Cold War to be able to use
consciousness high on the Soviet Union
that Soviet Union was doing the same
thing um and everyone in intelligence
community at a certain clearance level
knows about this by the way this is
nothing you know all that secret it&#39;s
hidden in plain sight um but what was
interesting to me was that you know he
regretted that he ended up being used
that way eventually but what he and I
would talk about together is is the fact
that every single human being has the
ability to do this they just don&#39;t do
anything to help develop it
so it&#39;s like you don&#39;t start out in
kindergarten doing quantitative analysis
and calculus there&#39;s a process right
it&#39;s the same thing with these
capabilities um you know I bench press
410 pounds but you don&#39;t start out that
way you rip your you know pectoralis
muscles in half so you you so everything
is a iterative learning developing
process of skill and knowledge and
experience it builds on itself over time
most people just never take the time to
sit down two three times a day go into
quiet meditative State and then practice
the ability to intend to know and I call
it the intend to know because it&#39;s not
brute will it&#39;s quietly going into
Consciousness and then saying I want to
know this I want to see this place and
let it open very subtly it&#39;s a very
subtle um integrative
process as opposed to a brutal
intellectual
one my own approach to this is a very
viic one and as you know the ancient
vadas people conflate the vas with
Hinduism they have really very little to
do with each other V the vadic knowledge
predates any known it&#39;s a philosophy but
vant is really the study of
Consciousness in its
Singularity and that&#39;s of course from
that the concept of the human
experiencing that state which is called
samade or
Nirvana um but there&#39;s this
misunderstanding in the public that only
certain adepts you know that you have to
lay on a bed of nails for 30 years and
you know do all kinds of crazy stuff to
be able to have this happen it simply
isn&#39;t true uh every single human being
can learn to sit quietly go into a
meditative State using whatever works
for you I use a type of Mantra
meditation um it can also be a breathing
technique with Mantra there are a lot of
approaches to it the key thing is for
the mind to become quiet centered and
allow it to become very deeply centered
and at the point where all thought and
awareness of everything disappears but
you&#39;re not asleep you&#39;re still awake it
may just be a flash that&#39;s the samama
state it&#39;s the experience of pure
Consciousness without
differentiation that&#39;s the state of pure
non-locality at that point you are
omnipresent you&#39;re everywhere and it is
at that point that if you begin to PR
practice and experience that you can
stay very steady state in your awareness
and then intend while still being very
quiet to see or know something that&#39;s
remote like where Starship is or what&#39;s
going on at home in your
kitchen
