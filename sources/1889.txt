 Flower started this journal while in the county jail in Carson City, Nevada, awaiting trial for a fraudulent stock scheme arising from his stock promotions in his previous journal Gold Field Gossip.  (The publisher of this journal also published Gold Field Gossip.)  The journal's sole nods to occult or New Thought themes is in the articles in the early issues by "Ram Dass," a supposed Hindu who had fled the British in India, who wrote on the likes of "How to Kill Fear and Worry Instantly", and Flower's regular "little compilations of the best things that have been said or written by the world's greatest thinkers," taken from The Penny Classics, a series of pupular books published by William Walker Atkinson's Yogi Publication Society in Chicago.   The first of these printed in the journal was on Emerson, followed by Seneca, Maurice Maeterlinck, and Marcus Aurelius.  The principal content of the journal was Flower's well-written, humorous ramblings on prison life and the Runyonesque characters who shared his life in jail, supplemented by general musings on philosophy: socialism, he opined, "will come, and cannot be stopped, but. as I said above, I am not ready for it myself. I should prefer a year or two in the capitalist class."  The Editor's Preface to the first issue emphasized that the journal would "be a tremendous success.  It will pay my debts!"--a remark probably aimed at the judge who would probably sentence him.  The first run was 15,000 copies, which was sent to everyone on Flower's mailing list, but the journal can not have had a wide circulation.  The World's Advance Thought, February 1911, calls this "an interesting little magazine, edited by one who is progressive and not afraid of speaking the truth"--strange terms to apply to Flower.  The advertisement in the Philistine, April 1911, notes that Flower had started the New Thought but that this journal was not New Thought, but was "read by original people, and they seem to like it."   The advertisement (or more properly the infomercial, since it is phrased in the editor's voice) in the Fra the next month lists Flower's address as Sierra Madre, California, and notes  Flower's new project, described in the journal: the Havilah Village,"a movement to better mankind everywhere," "a spotless town, spiritually, mentally and physically.  A town is a living thing composed of living, breathing and working people.  In many movements for civic righteousness this fact has been forgotten and the human element has not been considered.  Mr. Flower has taken the broader view, and every citizen of his ideal town will be considered in the scheme and so will have the best interests of his fellow-citizens as well as his own near his heart."  Flower was called "a man of ideas, also ideals.  Whatever he says to you in his magazine is straight from the heart, and if you are on his mental wire you will readily understand all he says"--undoubtedly to your financial detriment.  Haviland, the Health Village, led to Flower's brief involvement with Haviland Haines Lund, and the Forward-to-the-Land League, and apparently a brief stint with its periodical, Little Farms Magazine. After this Flower appears, in 1915, in New York promoting "Trichemistry"--dietetic supplements to improve health and lengthen life.
