back in the 1990s I was read into or
briefed on a project that involved an
interagency group that had the ability
to disclose the et presence in a way
that would frighten everyone on earth
and convinced the public that there was
an alien threat which is completely
false it&#39;s all alive and that this had
been developed in the 50s and they had
been developing the means and the
psychological warfare to make that
happen
so in the 1990s I wrote a paper called
when disclosure served secrecy what that
means is there are two kinds of
disclosures that might happen a truthful
one that is also a hopeful one which is
what I gave up my medical career to try
to actuate do and then there&#39;s the one
that is spun by the spin Meister&#39;s in
Washington and at the Pentagon and CIA
which runs like this it&#39;s true the UFOs
are real they&#39;re here as a threat
they&#39;re violating our airspace there are
national security and a threat and a
threat to our sovereignty I&#39;m quoting
the purpose of the program advanced
aerospace threat identification program
was really designed to do just that from
a national security perspective identify
those things that we see and try to
ascertain and determine if that
information
is a potential threat to national
security and we knew this was going to
happen because I had met with people who
were in these classified projects who
were on interagency committees that had
everything set to roll this out and they
were just waiting for the right time the
Soviet Union has ended we have the
global terrorism while it&#39;s still there
is not like it was around 9/11 this is
the next big thing
that they want the public to be afraid
of
