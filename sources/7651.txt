  		              		Experience Description   

    I had a massive heart attack on 04/30/2018 while driving my car. On 05/04/2018 I had open heart surgery to bypass three of my arteries that were 99% clogged.

  While in recovery and unconscious, I remember very vividly being in a room that felt like it was very bright.  The energy was very positive all around me.  While in this room, it felt like the most comfortable and biggest bed I have ever laid in before.  I also heard 5 voices in the room with me.  I couldn't see their faces, I could only feel and hear their presence.  They were speaking in a language I couldn't understand.  It wasn't English or any other language that is spoken on earth.  I was resting so comfortably and I felt so safe. I didn't want to leave nor did I want those beings around me to leave.  It almost was as if I was like a baby in a loving mother's arms, so comfortable and at peace.  Then I heard a voice.  But this time it was in English and I understood what he was saying.  The voice was very powerful in tone, stern with instructions, yet compassionate in delivery.  I remember he said, 'Ok Chad, it is time for you to go now.  It is time for you to wake.'  I remember responding, 'Why are you waking me? I am not ready to go. I don't want to go back!'  After I said that, it was like a light switch came on and I opened my eyes.  I was in a hospital room with tubes coming out of my mouth.  There were nurses and machines all around me.

  Since my life-changing event, I have been blessed not to have suffered any permanent damage to my heart from the heart attack. I weighed 325lbs and now I weigh 222lbs - I lost 105 lbs since surgery.  My family and I were blessed not to receive a medical bill from the life-changing event either.  Our operation and hospital stay was covered by emergency medical insurance provided by the government, because I had no medical insurance.

  I use the words our and we to describe the life changing event because it affected my entire family.  I have a 17 year old and 8 year old son and a 4 year old daughter to live for.  Of course, none of this would be possible without GOD and my loving wife by my side.
