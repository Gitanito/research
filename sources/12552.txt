That time was very different. I was counting numbers in order to relax and suddenly I felt the needle. Without me thinking about it the numbers were going by faster, I disappeared. I did not feel my body.

Everything was black with colored spheres turning, and what sounded like music (although this I don't remember too well). I felt vibrations. I am not sure whether the music was there or whether I was imagining it. I felt very well. The truth is that I did not ask myself what I was doing there. Suddenly I felt a strange pain and a headache. I had woken up and the doctors where giving me air. I asked how long I had been unconscious and they said approximately six seconds but it felt to me like it was much longer. The experience felt both long and short in duration. It was a very strange feeling. I would have liked to have stayed there longer. I felt a distorted sense of time when I woke up.
