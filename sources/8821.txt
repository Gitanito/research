  		              		Experience Description   

    I was in the classroom and we were reviewing a subject. 

   In a moment, I was no longer at my desk.  I was  floating at the front of the classroom a few centimeters  above the floor. Then I saw that everyone had crowded around somebody and I tried to see what had happened.  I saw everyone was around my physical body trying to resuscitate me and I seemed to be floating above everyone, a little higher at this time. At this moment, I felt myself rising a bit higher than the roof. I felt  a sensation of heat. I went  through the roof and then everything was just light. 

  It was from there that I felt my eyes closing. When I opened them again, I was at my desk with everyone around me. They were telling me that I had fainted and had stopped breathing.

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, but the facts have not been checked out

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   When I had to explain it to my parents, they didn't understand it. I was seven years old and they thought it had been a dream.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.    

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?

Also I think I am able to tell easily if someone is lying or not.

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I didn't understand it very well, but I knew I had seen these things, and I didn't know how to explain them.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     Through many years of reading and research I know that everything that happened to me is possible.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   Trying to leave my physical body in a conscious way, I have been able to reproduce it a couple of times at least. But not with the same intensity.
