modern science tor such tables us the Story or
Adam and Eve ond the 1.'1111 of Man tor tbelr
BinI. Tbls excludes the necl'8slty for tho Atone-
ment. or the fable thl1t God Bent his only begot-
ten son to be crucified JlS a human Bacrlflce and
thUI atone tor the effects of Adl1m and Kve'e Fall.
The myths or the Trinity, the Imn1ncuht~ Coo-
caption, the Virgin Birth, the Resurrection of
the Dead (except as entities such lIB are belne
Investlgnted today by societies for psychic re-
search) are pure nonsenlle. Jesul did not pertorm
any miracles that' mollern man cannot duplicate.
.Tesus was 11 mau the same as you or I. Jesus did
not teach any of tile above myths. On the con·
trary, he taught that such Roman mythology
and polytheism, propagnted by tile Romall
hierarchy. was utterly false anu ridiculolls.
Therefore ·Jesus was a true nlE'sslah. By thl!'
Second Coming of Jesus is mount the Advent Of
the Spirit of Truth.
Jesus WIlS a Jewish martyr, cruclfled and later
killed by Roman pogaDs. The Jews have always
been a race ot mart)'r9 for the sake of monoUie-
Ism. More Jews. bave been murderell as mart)'rs,
even to this dllY. than ull other nations put to-
gether. The story of Jcsul;l In tbe New Testament
was falsified b)' the Roman hierarchy. And Pro-
testantism Is stili tbe dupe of Roman pflgoniam_
(Thls must not be construed as a reflection on
Roman Catholics.)
There Is an Euclides.n axiom that "things equI11
to the same thing nre equal to one another." '.l'hls
fact Is also a spiritual law. When Jeslls came he
WAS opposed very much tbe same DI'J Immanuel.
"H~ !lath a demon, he is mad. he Is a blnaphemer,
Ire 18 a glutton and a wine blbber, he consortetb
with sinners, he castetb out devils by the .Prince
of Devils '" And they persecuted him. The disci-
ple Is not above his Master. and so becaUSe>
"things that are equal to the same thing ure
equl11 to one another." let them be ta·ken as
strong evidence that Immanuel emanates from
the Bame Source as Jesus. His publication or
these etemal truths eonstitutes Immanuel a
melllllab.

DOCTOR OF THEOTHERkPY
Theotherapy, God's science of healing,
is according to the unbroken traditions of
religious schools in the East, the method
of healing used by Elijah, Elisha, Jesus,
and by all the other healers mentioned
in the Old and New Testamenta.
Theotherapy is not a substitute for, it
is an adjunct to regular medicine and
h~~y ~t1acJ~t,~~~er~~dlcin~h~
surgery. Jesus used remedial agents such
as water, mud, and spittle.
Theotherapy is not suggestion or auto-
suggestion. It does not teach that disease
is a delusion. It tellches exactly the op-
posite. Disease is the result of violated
law':"" so stated by the Maker of all law.
Medicine and surgery when useJ etlu-
cally and scientifically, are instruments
of God. They are adjuncts of nature as is
Theotherapy. Nature is a function of God.
The superconscious is not creduloUS. It
will not believe a lie. If the body is sick,
the superconscious knows it, and no a-
mount of suggestion will make it believe
that its sickness is only imagination.
The superconscious or soul is, however,
obedient and will comprehend and co-
operate with a categorical imperative. A
categorical imperative to the central ner-
vous system sends out millions of little
physicians found in the body and many
internal secretions, on errands of mercy
and healing. Theotherapy supplies
through the nervous system this cate-
gorical imperative to the cells and to the
endocrine glands, and then in accordance
with divine law, health follows.

ANNUNCIATION AND BIRTH OF JOHN
There was, in the days of Herod the king of
fades, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the
coarse of Abia; and his wife was of the daughters
of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.
And they were both righteous before God, walk­
ing in all the coimnandments and ordinances of
the Lord, blameless.
And they had no child, because that Elisabeth
vas barren, and they both were now well stricken
in years.
And it came to pass, that while he executed the
priest’s office before God in the order of his
course, according to the custom of the priest’s
office, his lot was to burn incense when he went
into the temple of the Lord.
And the whole multitude of the people was
praying without, at the time of incense.
And there appeared unto him an angel of the
Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of
incense.
And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled,
andfear fell upon him.
But the angel said unto him, Fear not,
Zacharias, for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife
Elisabethshall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call
his name John.
And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and
m
any shall rejoice at his birth.
For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord,
andshall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and
h
eshall be filled with the holy ghost, which is the
spirit of truth, even from his mother’s womb.
Andmany of the children of Israel shall he turn
totheLordtheir God.
And he shall go before a messiah in the spirit
an
d power of Elias, and turn the hearts of the
fathersto the children, and the disobedient to the
wisdomof the just; to make ready a people pre-
land for the Lord.
And Zacharias said unto the angel. Whereby
■
h
aBI know this? For 1 am an old man, and my
rife w
eOstricken in yean.
And the angel, answering, said unto him, I am
Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God, and am
sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these
glad tidings.
And. behold, thou shalt be dumb and not able
to speak, until the day that these things shall be
performed, because thou behevest not my words,
which shall be fulfilled in their season.
And the people waited for Zacharias, and mar­
velled that he tarried so long in the temple.
And when he came out, he could not speak unto
them; and they perceived that he had seen a
vision in the temple, for he beckoned unto than,
and remained speechless.
And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days
of his ministration were accomplished, he depart­
ed to his own house.
And after those days, his wife Elisabeth con­
ceived, and hid herself five months, saying. Thus
hath the Lord dealt with me, in the days wherein
he looked on me, to take away my reproach among
men.
-ANNUNCIATION OF THE BIRTH OF JESUS
And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel like­
wise was sent from God, unto a city of Galilee,
named Nasareth, to the young woman espoused to
the man whose name was Joseph, of the house of
David; and the young woman’s namewas Mary.
And the angel came in unto her, and said. Hafl,
thou that art highly favored, the Lard is with
thee. Blessed art thou among women.
And when she saw him, she was troubled at his
saying, and cast in her mind what manner of sal­
utation this shouldbe.
And the angel said unto her. Fear not, Mary;
for thou hast found favor with God.
And, behold, thou shalt conceive m thy womb,
and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name
Jesus.
He shall be great, and shall be called a son of
the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto him
the mitre of his father David.
And he shall be a high priest over the house of
Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom, the kingdom
of God, there shall be no and.
Then said Mary unto the angel. How shall this
be, seeing that I know not a man?
And the angel answered and said unto her. The
spirit of truth shall come upon thee, and the power
of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore
also that holy thing which shall be born of thee
*hwll be born as a son of God, for his soul shaD be
of God, and his body shall be of man.
And. behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath abo
conceived, by the spirit of truth, a son in her rid
age; and this is the sixth month with her who waa
called barren. For with God nothing shaD be im­
possible.
And Mary said. Behold the handmaid of the
Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.
And the angel departed from her.

And blessed is she that believed; for there shall
be a performance of those things which were told
her from the Lord God.
And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord.
And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my savior.
For hehathregarded the lowestate of his hand­
maiden; for, behold, from henceforth all genera­
tions shall call me blessed.
For he that is mighty hath done to me great
things; and holy is his name.
And his mercy is on them that fear him, from
generation to generation.
He hathshewed strength with his arm; he hath
scattered the proud in the imagination of their
hearts.
He hath put downthe mighty from their seats,
and exaltedthemof low degree.
He hath filled the hungry with good things, and
the rich he hath sent empty away.
He hath helped his servant Israel, in remem­
branceof his mercy; as he spake toour fathers, to
Abraham, and to his seed for ever.
And Mary abode with her about three months,
andreturned to her own house.
BIRTH AND INFANCY OF JOHN
THE BAPTIST
Now Elisabeth’s full time came, that she should
be delivered;andshe brought forth a son.
And her neighbors and her cousins heard how
the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and
they rejoiced with her..
And it came to pass, that ontheeighth day they
cuirif to circumcise the child; and they called him
Zacharias, after the name of his father.
And his mother answered, and said. Not so; but
hr shall be called John.
wvi they said unto her, There is none of thy
k
u
tO
C
rrdthat iscalledbythisname.
And they made signs to his father, how he
pffiAd have him called.
ri§Abd he asked for a writing table, and wrote,
•*i>ing, His name is John. And they marvelled all.
And his mouth was opened immediately, and
N f c l o o s e d , and he spake, andpraised God.
Ao0 fear came upon all that dwelt round about
thawo \iu» ail tneae sayings were noised abroad
throughout all the hill country of Judea. ~
And all they that heard them laid them up|1
their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall
this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him
,
And his father Zacharias was filled with the
holy ghost, and prophesied, saying:
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath
visited and redeemed his people; ' J
And hath raised up a horn of salvation for u
s,
in the house of his servant David;
As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets,
which have been since the world began;
That we should be saved from our enemies, and
from the hand of all that hate us;
To perform the mercy promised to our fathers!
and to remember his holy covenant;
The oath which he sware to our father Abrs-
ham;
That he would grant unto us, that we, beingde­
livered out of the hand of our enemies, might
serve him without fear;
In holiness and righteousness before him, all
the days of our life;
And thou, child, shalt be called the prophets|j
the Highest"; for thou Shalt go before the face of
a master, to prepare his ways;
To give knowledge of salvation unto his people^
and the remission of their sins;
Through the tender mercy at our God; whereby
the dayspring from on high hath visited us; |
To give light to them that sit in darkness and
in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the
way of peace.
And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit^
and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing
unto Israel.
THE ANGEL APPEARS TO JOSEPH '
Now the birth of Jesus the messiah was onthis
wise:
The angel of the Lord appeared! unto Joseph,
as unto Mary, in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou
sonof David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy
wife because of the prophecy that which shall be
conceived in her shall be of the holy ghost, c
She shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt csB
his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from
their sins.
His soul shall be of the holy ghost, but his body
shall be of the seed of David.
Njow all this was done, that it might be fulfilled*
which was spoken of the Lord by the prophets,
saying:
Behold, a young woman shall be with child, and
shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his
name Im-anu-el; which being interpreted is, G
od
with us.
Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did asthe
angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto;
him his wife; aiidi knew her not after the concep­
tion, till she had brought forth her firstborn son.
And he called his name Jesus, but others called
him Ln>ami-el, as Joseph also was
Ananus.
t h e BIR TH OF JESUS
And it rr*"J
> t» ptaa in those days, that there
»«st oat a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all
tie work! should be taxed. (And this taxing was
fint made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria)
a
w
%
a til went to be taxed, every one into his own
dry.
iiw< Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of
thecityof Narzareth, into Judea, unto the city of
David, which is called Bethlehem (because he was
of the house and lineage o f David), to be taxed
with Mary his wife, being great with child.
And so it was, that, while they were there, the
days were accomplished that she should be deliv­
ered.
And she brought forth her first born son, and
wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in
a manger, because there was no room for them
is the inn.
ADORATION O F TH E SHEPHERDS
And there were in the same country shepherds
abiding in the field, keeping watch over their
flock by night.
And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them,
and the glory of the Lord shone round about
them; and they were sore afraid.
And the angel said unto them, Fear not; for,
behold, 1 bring you good tidings of great joy,
which shall be to all people.
For unto you is born this day, in the city of
Pavid, a savior, which is the anointed of the Lord.
And this shall be a sign unto you: Ye shall find
the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a
manger.
And suddenly there was with the angel a multi­
tude of the heavenly host, praising God, and say-
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace, good will toward men.
And it came to pass, as the angels were gone
away from them into heaven, the shepherds said
one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethle­
hem, and see this thing which is come to pass,
which the Lord hath made known unto us.
And they came with haste, and found Mary, and
Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.
And when they had seen it, they made known
abroadthe saying which was told them concerning
thischild.
And all they that heard it wondered at those
things which were told them by the shepherds.
But Mary kept all these things, and pondered
than in her heart
And the shepherds returned, glorifying and
praising God for all the things that they had
heard and seen, as it was told unto them.
CIRCUMCISION O F JESUS
And when eight days were accomplished for the
orcumrising of the child, Jesus was circumcised,
for he was a Jew, and his name was called Jesus,
which was so named of the angel before he was
conceived in the womb.
And when the days of her purification, ac­
cording to the law of Moees, were accomplished.
they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him
to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord,
Every male that openeth the womb shall be called
holy to the Lord; therefore was Jesus called a son
o f God) ; and to offer a sacrifice according to jtefc
which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair o f
turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem,
whose name was Simeon; and the same mm was
just and devout, waiting for the consolation o f
Israel. And the holy ghost was upon him, as it
had been upon Mary and Elisabeth and Joseph and
7jnO>ariM
And it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost,
that he should not see death, before he had seen
the Lord's anointed.
And he came by the spirit into the temple; and
when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do
for him after the custom of the law, then took he
him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said:
Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in
peace, according to thy word;
For mine eyes have seen thy salvation.
Which thou hast prepared before the face of aU
people;
A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of
thy people Israel.
And his father Joseph and his mother marvelled
at those things which were spoken of him.
And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary
his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall
and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign
which shall be spoken against (Yea, a sword shall
pierce through thine own soul also), that the
thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the
daughter of Phannel of the tribe of A s e r; she was
o f great age, and had lived with a husband seven
years from her virginity.
And she was a widow of about fourscore and
four years, which departed not from the temple,
but served God with fastings and prayers night
and day.
And she, coming in that instant, gave thanks
likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all
them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.
And when they had performed all things accord­
ing to the law of the Lord, they returned into Gal­
ilee, to their own city Nazareth.
AD O R ATIO N OF TH E W ISE M EN
Now in the mean while when Jesus was bora in
Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the
king, behold there came wise men from the east to
Jerusalem, saying:
Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For
we have seen his light in the east, and are come
to worship him.
When Herod the king had heard these things,
he was troubled, for he was a usurper and not an
Israelite; and all Jerusalem was troubled with
him.
And when he had gathered all the chief priests
and scribes of the people together, he d im iw h i
of them where a meaaiah should be bora.

the same came for a witness, to bear witness of
£e light, that all men through him might believe.
Be was not that light, but was sent to bear
witness of that light.
That was the true light, which lighteth every
gas that cometh into the world.
Be was in the world, and the world was made by
hw Father, and the world knew him not.
He came onto his own, and his own received him

that believed in his word, to them gave he the
power to become sons of God, which were born,

And the logos entered into flesh, and dwelt

of a son of our Father), full of grace and truth.
BAPTISMS OF JOHN IN JORDON
And John came into all the country about Jor­
don, and did baptize in the wildernes, and preach
the baptism of repentance for the remission of
ans.
And there went out unto him all the land of
Judea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all bap­
tized of him in the river Jordon, confessing their
U
B
S.
But when he saw many of the pharisees and
mddocees come to his baptism, he said unto them,
0 generation of vipers, who hath warned you to
flee from the wrath to come?
Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repent-
purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the
garner, but he will burn up the chaff with un­
quenchable fire.
And the people asked him, saying, What shall
we do then?
He answered and said unto them, He that hath
two coats, let him impart to him that hath none;
and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.
Then came also publicans to be baptized, and
said unto him, Master, what shall we do?
And he said unto them, Exact no more than
that which is appointed you.
And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, say­
ing, And what shall we do?
And he said unto them, Do violence to no man,
neither accuse any falsely, and be content with
your wages.
And as the people were in expectation, and all
men mused in their hearts of John, whether he
was a messiah or not, John bare witness of Jesus.
And this is the record of John, when also the
Jews sent priests and levites from Jerusalem to
ask him, Who art thou ?
And he confessed and denied not; but confessed,
I am not a messiah.
And they asked him, What then ? Art thou
Elias? And he said, I am not. Art thou that pro­
phet? And he answered, No.
Then said they unto him, Who are thou? that
we may give an answer to them that sent us.
What sayest thou of thyself? y»r
He repeated, I am the voice of one crying, In the
wilderness make straight the way of Jehovah, as
saith the prophet Esaias.
And they which were sent were of the phari­
sees. And they asked him, and said unto him, Why
baptizest thou then, if thou be not that messiah,
nor Elias, neither that prophet?
John answered them as to the others, saying, I
baptize with water; but there standeth one among
you, whom ye know not.
He it is, who coming after me is preferred be­
fore me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to
unloose.
And many other things, in his exhortation,
preached he unto the people.
These things were done in Bethab&ra beyond
Jordon, where John was baptizing.
H R .
And think not to say within yourselves, We have
Abraham to our father; for I say unto you, that
God is able of these stones to raise up children
onto Abraham.
And now also the axe is laid unto the root of
the trees; therefore every tree which bringeth
not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into
thefire.
TESTIMONY OF JOHN TO JESUS
1indeed baptize you with water unto repent­
ance, but he that cometh after me is mightier
than I, whose shoes 1 am not worthy to bear. He
than baptize you with the holy ghost, and with
of truth.

THE BAPTISM OF JESUS BY JOHN
And it came to pass in those days that Jesus
came from Nazareth of Galilee to Jordon, unto
John, to be baptized of him.
But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be
baptized of thee, and contest thou to me?
And Jesus answering, said unto him, Suffer
it to be so now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil
all righteousness. Then he suffered him.
And Jesus, when he was baptized, wont up
staightway out of the water; and, lo, the heavens
were opened unto him, and John saw the epirit of
God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him.
And, lo, a clairaudient voioe from heaven, say­
ing, This is my beloved sou, in whom I am well
TEMPTATION OF JESUS IN THE
WILDERNESS
And Jesus, being full of the holy ghost, return­
ed from Jordon, and was led by the spirit into the
wilderness, being forty days tempted of the devil.
And in those days he was with the wild beasts,
and he did eat nothing; and) when they were end-
I ed, he afterward hungered.
_
_ [And the devil said unto him, If thou be a son
of God, command this stone that it be made bread.
And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written,
that man shall not live by bread alone, but by
every word of God.
And the devil, taking him up into a high moun­
tain. shewed tmto him all the kingdoms of the
world in a moment of time.
And the devil said unto him, All this power will
t give thee, and the glory of them; for that is de­
livered untome, and to whomsoever I will I give it.
If thou, therefore, wilt worship me, all shall be
thine.
And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get
thee behind me, Satan; for it is written, Thou
sha.lt worship the Lord thy God, and him only
Shalt thou serve.
And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him
on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If
thou be a son of God, cast thyself down from
hence; for it is written, He shall give his angels
charge over thee, tp keep' thee; and
in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at
any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
And'Jesus, answering, said unto him, It is said,
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
And when the devil had ended all the tempta­
tion, he departed from him for a season, and
angels came and ministered unto him.
SECOND TESTIMONY OF JOHN TO JESUS
The next day John saw Jesus coming unto him
and said, Behold the lamb of God, which taketh
away the sin of the world.
This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a
man which is preferred before me; for he was be­
fore me.
And I knew him not; but that he should be
made manifest to Israel. Therefore am I come
baptising with water.
And John bare record, saying, I saw the spirit
descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode
open him.
And 1 knew him not; but he that sent me to
baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon
whom thou shalt see the spirit descending, and re­
maining upon him, the same is he which baptiz-
|
i with the holy ghost.
And 1saw, and bare record that this is a son of

k
ve all A, received, and grace for grace. For the
law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came
from Jesus the anointed. No man hath seen God
at any time; but this beloved son, which is cher­
ished in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared 1
him. fm
JESUS CALLS HIS FIRST DISCIPLES 3
Again the next day after, John stood, and two
of his disciples, and looking upon Jesus as he
walked, he said, Behold the lamb of God I
And the two disciples heard him speak, and
they followed Jesus.
Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and
said unto them, What seek ye? They said unto
him, Rabbi (which is to say being interpreted^
Master), where dwellest thou?
He said unto them, Come and see. They came.=
and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that f
day, for it was about the tenth hour,' if
One of the two which heard John speak, and
followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brothet»J§
He first found his own brother Simon, and said is
unto him, We have found a messiah.
And he brought him to' Jesus. And when Jesus H
beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of
Jona. Thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by |
interpretation, A stone.
The day following, Jesus would go forth into
Galilee, and found Philip, and said unto him, FWk |
low me.
Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of An- $
drew and Peter.
Philip found Nathaneal, and said unto him, We I
have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and
the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son
of Joseph.
And Nathaneal said unto him, Can there any' j
good thing come out of Nazareth ?
Philip said unto him, Come and see.
Jesus saw Nathaneal coming to him, and said of
him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no |
guile!
Nathaneal said unto him, Whence knowest thou I
me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before?j
that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the
fig tree, I saw thee.
Nathaneal answered and said unto him, Rabbi,
thou art a son of God; thou art a ruler in IsraeL
Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I
said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, be-
lievest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than
these.
And he said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto-
you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the
angels of God ascending and descending upon 1
son of man.
And Jesus began to be about thirty yearsof age,,
being the sonof Joseph, who was the sonof Ada.m„
who was the son of God.

LAST TESTIMONY OF JOHN
After these things came Jusua and hit disciples
Into the lurid of Judea; and then ht turled with
them, and baptized.
And John aito was baptizing in Aenon near to
Salim, because there was much water there; and
they came and were baptized; for John was not
yet cast into prison.
Then there arose a question between some of
John's disciples and some others about purifying.
And they came unto John, and said unto him,
Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordon, to
whom thou barest witness, behold, the same bap*
teeth, and all men come to him.
John answered and said, A man can receive
nothing, except it be given him from heaven.
Ye yourself bear me witness, that 1said, 1 am
not a messiah, but that 1am sent before him.
He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but
the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and
heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the
bridegroom’s voice. This my joy therefore Is
fulfilled.
He must increase, but 1must decrease.
He that cometh from above is above ail; he that
is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the
earth; he that cometh from heaven is above ail.
And what he hath seen and heard, that he testi-
fioth, and no man receiveth hie testimony.
He that hath received his testimony hath set
fa hie seal that God Is true.

The woman said unto him, Sir, thou hast nothe

whence then hast thou that living water?
Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which
gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, n
n
d
his children, and his cattle?
Josus answered' and said unto her, Whosoever
drinkoth of this water shall thirst again, but who*
soever drlnketh of the water that 1 shall give him
shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give
him shall be in him a well of water springing up
into everlasting life.
The woman said unto him, Sir, give me this
water, that 1 thirst not, neither come hither to
draw.
Jesus said unto her, Go, .call thy husband, and
come hither.
The woman answered and said, 1 have no hue*

Jesus saidi unto her, Thou hast well said, I have
no husband; for thou hast had five husbands, and
he whom thou now hast is not thy husband; In
that saidst thou truly.
The woman said unto him, Sir, I perceive that
thou art a prophet.
Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and
ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where m

ought to worship.
Jesus said unto her, Woman, believe me, Hie
hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this m
oun­
tain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
Ye worship ye know not what; we know what
we worship; for salvation ia of the Jewa.

Then they went out of the city, and came onto
him
.
In the mean while his disciples prayed him. say­
ing, Master, eat.
Bat he said onto them, I have meat to eat that
yeknownot of.
Therefor? said the disciples one to another,
Bath any man brought him ought to eat?
•Jesus said unto them. My meat is to do the will
of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
Say not ye. There are yet four months, and
then cometh harvest? Behold, I say onto you, lift
up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are
white already to harvest.
And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gath-
ereth. fruit unto life eternal; that both he that
soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
And herein is that saying true, One soweth and
another reapeth.
1send you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no
labor; other men labored, and ye are entered into
theirlabors.
And many of the Samaritans of that city be­
lieved on him for the saying of the woman, which
testified, He told me all that ever I did.
So when the Samaritans were come unto him,
they besought him that he would tarry with
them; and he abode there two days.
And many more believed because of his word,
and «n*d unto the woman. Now we believe not be­
cause of thy saying; for we have heard him our­
selves, and know that this is indeed a messiah, a
savior of the world.
Now therefore was Jesus called a Samaritan
messiah. And Josephus testifieth that so great
was the wrath of the Jews when Pontius Pilate
crucified the Samaritan messiah Jesus, that Pilate
was recalled and took his own life.
RETURN TO GALILEE
Now after two days he departed thence, and
went into Galilee. For Jesus himself testified
that a prophet hath no homerit himearn muatry.
Then wham he was come into ^llffcrf. the CaM»
leans received him, having aemaaB the thugs that
he did at Jerusalem at the feast; for they aim
went unto the feast.
HEALING OF THE NOBLEMAN'S SOU
So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where
he made the water wine. And there was a certain
nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
When be heard that Jesus was come out of
Judea into Galilee, he went unto him. and be­
sought h»m that he would come down, and heal his
son; for he was at the point of death.
Then said Jesus unto him. Except ye see signs
and wooden, ye will not believe.
The nohionrvan said unto him, Sir, come down are
my son die.
Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth.
And the man believed the word that Jesus hut
spoken unto him, and he went his way.
And as he was now going down, his servants
met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.
Then inquired he of them the hour when he be­
gan to amend. And they said unto him. Yesterday
at the seventh hour the fever left him.
So the father knew that it was at the same
hour, in which Jesus said unto him. Thy son liv­
eth. And himself believed, and his whole house.
This is again the second miracle that Jesus did,
when he was eonfe out of Judea into Galilee.
MIRACLE AT POOL OF BETHESDA
After this there was another Jewish feast, and
Jesus went up to Jerusalem again, for Jesus also
was a Jew.
Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market,
a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue
Bethesda, having five porches.
In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk,
of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of
the water.
For, as the people believed, an angel went down
at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the
water. Whosoever then first after the troubling
of the water stepped in, was made whole of what­
soever disease he had. The people, therefore, ac­
cepted miracles even before Jesus came.
And a certain man was there, which had an
infirmity thirty and eight years.
When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he
had been now a long time in that case, he said
unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?
The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no
man, when the water is troubled, to put me into
the pool; but while I am coming, another steppeth
down before me.
Jesus said unto him. Rise, take up thy bed, and
walk.
And immediately the man was made whole, and
took up his bed, and walked, and on the same day
was the sabbath.
Some therefore said unto him that was cured, It
is the sabbath day; it is not lawful for thee to
carry thy bed.
—IS—
He Answered them, He that made me whole, the
same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
Then asked they him, What man Is that which
said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?
And he that was healed wist not who it was;
for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude
being in that place.
Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and
said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole; sin
no more, lest a worse thing come upon thee.
The man departed, and told that it was Jesus
which had made him whole.
And therefore did the two high priests of Herod
persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because
he had done these things on the sabbath day, and
had proclaimed himself a messiah. For the two
high priests were Herodians, and held Herod him­
self for a messiah, against the general will of the
Jews.
But Jesus answered them, Our Father worketh
hitherto, and I work.
Therefore they sought the more to kill him,
because he not only had broken the sabbath, but
said also that God was his Father, making him­
self equal with God, as they thought.
Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Veri­
ly, verily, I say unto you, A son can do nothing of
himself, but what he seeth his Father do; for what
things soever he doeth, these also doeth a son
likewise.
For our Father loveth his sons, and sheweth
them all things that himself doeth; and he will
shew his sons greater works than these, that ye
may marvel.
For as our Father raiseth up the dead, and
quickeneth them ; even so a son quickeneth whom
he wiU.
For our Father judgeth no man, but hath com­
mitted all judgment unto his sons, that all men
should honor his sons, even as they honor our
Father. He that honoreth not a son, honoreth not
our Father which hath sent him.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth
my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath
everlasting life, and shall not come into condem­
nation; but is passed from death unto life.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is com­
ing, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice
o f a son of God; and they that hear shall live
For as our Father hath life in himself, so hath
he given to a son to have life in himself; and hath
given him authority to execute judgment also, for
he is a son of man.
Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming in
the which many that are in their graves shall hear
his voice, and their spirits shall come forth; they
that have done good, unto the resurrection of life;
and they that have done evil, unto the resurrec­
tion of damnation.
I can of mine own self do nothing; as I hear I
judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek
not mine own will, but the will of our Father
which hath sent me.
If 1 bear witness of myself, my witness is not

But X have greater witness than that of Jobs;

his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.
And ye have not his word abiding in you; for

Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye

And ye will not come to me, that ye might hare

I receive not honor from men.
But I know you, that ye have not the love of God
in you.
I am come in our Father’s name, and ye receive I
me not; if another shall come in his own name,
him ye will receive.
How can ye believe, which receive honor one of
another, and seek not the honor that cometh from
God only?
Do not think that I will accuse you to our
iFather; there is one that accuseth you, even
[Moses, in whom ye trust.
For had ye believed in Moses, ye would have be­
lieved in me, for he wrote o f me.
But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye
believe my words?
JOHN THE BAPTIST CAST INTO PRISON |
I About this time Herod the tetrarch being re­
proved of John for Herodias his wife, and for all
the evils which Herod had done, added yet this
above all, that he shut up John in prison. For
John testified that Jesus not Herod was a messiah
to the Jews.
Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast
into prison, he departed into Galilee. And cam#
into his own country, and his disciples followed!
him.
PREACHING IN NAZARETH
And he came to Nazareth where he had been
brought up. And, as his custom was, he went into
the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up
to read according as he was a Jew. . '
And there was delivered unto film the book of
the prophet Esais. And when he had opened the
book, he found the place where it was written;^

CALL OP ANDREW, PETER, JAMES AND
JOHN
And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw.
the two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew
his brother, easting a net into the sea; for they
were fishers.
And he said onto them. Follow me, and I will
m
ake you fishers of men.
And they straightway left their nets, and fol­

Asd going from thence, he sawother two breth­

brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father,

ending their nets; and he called them.
And they immediately left the ship and their
father, and followed him.
MIRACLE OF UNCLEAN SPIRIT
And they went into Capernaum; and straight­
way on the aafcfejgfh day be entered into the tjmr
gogoe, and taught.
And they were astonished at his doctrine, for
he taught them as « e that had authority, and
not ae the scribes.
And them was In their $rm§ugue a mm wfth
an undean spirit; and be cried out, saying. Let ue
alone. What bare we to do with thee thou Jeaus
of Nazareth ?Art thou coma to deatroy us? I knew

HEALING PETEK’S MOTHER-IN-LAW
Acd forthwith, when they were come out of
the synagogue, they entered into the house ef BL
soon and Andrew, with JamesandJoin.
But Sunun’s wife's Brother lay rick of a fever;
and anon they told him of her.
And he came aad took her by the hand, aad
lifted her up, and immediately the fever left her,
and she ministered unto them.
HEALING MANY SICK AND DISEASED
And at even, when the sundidnet, they brought
unto him all that were diseased, and them that
were peasessod with devils.
And all the city was gathered together at the
door. - >Jpa B B
And he healed many that were sick of driers
diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered
not the devils to speak, because they knew him.
WITHDRAWAL FOR SOLITARY PRAYER
And in the morning, rising up a great while be­
fore day, he went out, and departed intoa solitary
place, and there prayed.
And Simon, and they that were with him, fol­
lowedafter him.
And when they had found him, they said unto
him. All men seek for thee.
And he said unto them, Let us go into the next
towns, that I may preach there also; for therefore
came I forth.
SERMON ON THE MOUNT
And he went up into a mountain and when he
was set hecalled unto himwhom he would, and his
disciples cameunto him
.
And he opened himmouth and taught them, say­
ing: , ■ p i ,J O
Blessed are the poor; for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven.
But woe unto you that are rich! for ye ham
received your consolation.
Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be
comforted.
Blessed are ye that weepnow, for ye shall laugh.
Bat woe anto you that laugh now! for ye shall
mourn and weep.
Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the
earth.
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst;
for they shall be filled.
But woe unto you that are full! for ye shall
hunger.
Blessed are the merciful; for they shall obtain
tnercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see
God.
Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be
called the children of God-
Blessed are they which are persecuted for
righteousness' sake; for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven.
Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and
persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil
against you falsely, for my sake.
But woe unto you when all mm shall speak well
of you! for so did their fathers to the false proph­
ets.
And woe unto them that shall persecute any of
God’s Jewish people in my name. Their cities shall
be laid waste, even as Jerusalem shall be wasted.
The righteous nations of the earth shall unite,
again and again, against the persecutors of the
Jews, and those persecutors shall be utterly des­
troyed.
Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for great is your
reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the
prophets which were before you.
Ye are the salt of the earth, but if the salt have
lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? It
is henceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out,
and to be trodden under foot of men.
Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set
on a hill cannot be hid.
Neither do men light a candle, and put it under
a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light
unto all that are in the house.
Let your light so shine before men, that they
may see your good works, and glorify your
Father which is in heaven.
Think not that I am come to destroy the law,
or the prophets; I am not come to destroy, but to
fulfil.
For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth
pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass
from the law, fill aU be fulfilled.
Whosoever therefore shall break one of these
least commandments, and shall teach men so, he
shah be called the least in the kingdomof heaven;
but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same
shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
1 am not come to destroy the law of Moses, but
to fulfil the law; and whosoever shah in my name
persecute the children of Moses, persecuteth also
me; for persecutions will come, from those even
who will call themselves by my name.
For 1 say unto you, that except your righteous­
ness shall exceed the righteousness of some of the
aenbes andpharisees, ye shall in no case enterinto
! kingdom of heaven.

Ye have heard that it was said of them of $j|
time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever stall|||
shall be in danger of the judgment
But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry
with his brother without a cause, shall be indan­
ger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say
to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the
council; but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, sh
all
be in danger of hell fire.
Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the a
lta

and there rememberest that thy brother bath
ought against thee, leave there thy gift before the
altar, and go thy way. First be reconciled to thy
brother, and then come and offer thy gift \
Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thoo
art in the way with him, lest at any time the ad­
versary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge

prison.
Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no m
eans
come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost
farthing.
Ye have heard that it was said by them of old
time, Thou shalt not commit adultery.
But I say unto you that whosoever looketh o|a
woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery
with her already in his heart.
And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it ou
t,
and cast it from thee; for it is profitable for thee
that one of thy members should perish, and not
that thy whole body should be cast into helfc J
And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off,
and cast it from thee; for it is profitable for thee
that one of thy members should perish and not
that thy whole body should be cast into bell. 5
It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away |
his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce­
ment.
But I say unto you that whosoever shall
away his wife saving for the cause of formcatioi|
causeth her to commit adultery; and whosoevp
shall marry her that is separated but not divorc­
ed, committeth adultery.
Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by
them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thysd&
but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oatha M
But I say unto you, Swear not at all, neither by
heaven, for it is God’s throne; not by earth, for it
is his footstool; neither by Jerusalem, for it is tbs
city of the great King.
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because
thou canst not make one hair white or black. J
But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay,
nay; for whatsoever is more than these, eometh
of evil.
Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil; but
whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek,
turn to him the other also.
And if any man will sue thee at the law, and
take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.
—16—
H aimJwhosoever shall compel thee to go a mile,
go with him twain.
Give to him that asketh thee, and from him
gat would borrow o f thee turn not thou away.
Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt
love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy.
But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless
them that curse you, do good to them that hate
you, and pray for them which spitefully use you,
and persecute you; that ye may be the children
of your Father which is in heaven; for he maketh
his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and
I ^Hsfndeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

I Therefore when thou dost thine alms, do not
E sound a trumpet before thee, as the hyprocrites

The light of the body is the eye; if therefore
thine eye be frank, thy whole body shall be full
o f light.
But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall
be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is
in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
N o man can serve two masters; for either he
will hate the one, and love the other ; or else he
will hold to the one, and despise the other. Y e can­
not serve God and mammon.
Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for
your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.
Is not the life more than meat, and the body than
raiment?
Behold the fowls of the a ir; fo r they sow not,
neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet
your heavenly Father feedeth them. A re ye not
better than they ?
Which o f you by taking thought can add one
cobit unto his stature?
A nd why take ye thought for raiment? Consid­
er the lilies o f the field, how they g ro w ; they toil
not, neither do they spin, and yet I say unto you,
that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
like one of these.
Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass o f the
field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the
oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of
little faith ?
Therefore take no thought, saying, W hat shall
we eat? Or, W h at shall we drink? Or, Wherewith­
al shall we be clothed?
For after all these things do the Gentiles seek;
for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have
need of all these things.
But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his
righteousness; and all these things shall be added
unto you.
Take therefore no thought for the
m orrow; for the morrow shall take thought for
the things o f itself. Sufficient unto the day is the
evil thereof.
Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what
judgm ent ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with
what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you
again.
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in
thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam
that is in thine own eye? >,
O r how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me
pull out the mote out o f thine eye; and, behold, a
beam is in thine own eye?
Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out o f
thine own eye; and then shalt thou see dearly to
cast out the mote out o f thy brother’s eye.
Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, nei­
ther cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they
trample them under their feet, and turn again and
rend you.
Ask. and it shall be given you; seek, and ye
phall fin d ; knock, and it shall be opened iznto you.
— 17—
For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he
(that Hpeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh,
|t shall be opened.
What man is there of you, whom if his son ask
bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish,
will give him a serpent ?
If ye then, being evil, know how to give good
gifts unto your children, how much more shall
your Father which is in heaven give good things
to them that ask him?
Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that
men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for
this is the law and the prophets.
Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the
gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruc­
tion, and many there be which go in thereat; be­
cause strait is the gate, and narrow is the way,
which leadeth unto life; and few there be that
find it.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in
sheep's clothing, but Inwardly they are ravening
wolves.
Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men
gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles ?
Even so every good tree bringeth forth good
fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neith­
er can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit
is hewn down, and Cast into the fire.
Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
Not every one that saith unto me, Master,
Master, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven;
but he that doth the will' of our Father which is
In heaven.
Many will say to me in that day, Master, Mast­
er, have we not prophesied in thy name? And in
thy name have cast out devils? And in thy name
done many wonderful works?
And then will I profess unto them, 1never knew
you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
There shall be wars and slayings, persecutions
and torturings, imprisonments and all manner of
injustice, done in my name, by nations and
churches calling themselves after my name. And
they will say unto me, Lord, Lord, we have dons
these things in thy name, and to thy glory, that it
may justify the end. But I will profess unto them,
I never knew you; depart from m
e, ye generation
of vipers, into the nethermost depths of hell.
Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of
mine, and doeth them
, I will liken him unto a wise
m
an, which built his house upon a rock.
And the rain descended, and the floods came,
and thewinds blew, and beat upon that house; and
it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.
And every one that heareth these sayings of
a ^ ^ inine. and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a
foolish m
an, which built his house upon the sand.
And the rain descended, and the floods came,
jand the winds blew, and beat upon that house;
•ud it fell, and great was the fall of it. *
\nd it cam
e topasswhen Jesus had ended these
atMng*. the people were astonished at his doc-
tm*e; for he taught them as one having author­
ity, and not as the scribes.
And so great was the multitude that came to.
gether that they could not so much as eat bread.
And when his friends heard of it, they wentout
to lay hold of him; for they said, He is beside
himself.
DRAUGHT OF FISHES
And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed
upon him to hear the word of God, he stood bj
the lake of Gennesareth, and saw two ships stand,
ing by the lake; but the fishermen were gonecot
of them, and were washing their nets.
And he entered into one of the ships, w
hkfc
was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would-thmt
out a little from the land. And he sat down, and
taught the people out of the ship.
Now when he had left speaking, he said unto
Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let dow
n
your nets for a draught.
And Simon, answering, said unto him, M
aster,,
we have toiled all night, and have taken nothing!
nevertheless, at thy word I will let down the net.
And when they had done this, they inclosedfl
great multitude of fishes, and their net brak&JS
And they beckoned unto their partners* which,
were in the other ship, that they should come and
help them. And they came* and filled both the
ships, so that they began to sink.
When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at J
esu
s? ;
knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful
man, 0 Master. , 9
For he was astonished, and all that were with
him, at the draught of the fishes which they had
. ' I ‘5 8 S IP 5
And1so was also James and John, the sons’of
Zebedee, which were partners with Simon, M
And Jesus said unto Simon,' Fear not, frorad
henceforth thou shalt catch men.
And when they had brought their ships to land*’,
they forsook all, and followed him. ‘
HEALING OF A LEPER
And Jesus continued to preach in, the otherfj
synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out,’
devils.
And there came a leper to him, beseeching him
, ’
and kneeling down to him, and saying unto h
tm
».?
If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
And Jesus moved with compassion, put forthh
is
hand, and touched him; and said unto him
, I w
ill,*,
be thou clean.
And as soon as he had spoken, immediatelyIpe
leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed-!
And he straightway charged him, and forth­
with sent him away; and said unto him, See thoaI
say nothing to any man, but go thy way, shewthy­
self to the priest, and offer for thy cleansingthosr
things which Moses commanded, for a testimony
unto therh.
But he went out, and began to publish it m
uch,
and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that
Jesus couldno more openly enter into the city,but
was without inthe desert places;and they cam
eto
him from every quarter.

SERMON ON THE PLAIN 1
And it came to pass in those days, that he went
out into a mountain to pray, and continued #
night in prayer to God.
And he came down with his apostles, and stood
in the plain, in the company of his disciples, an
d
in a great multitude of people out of all Judea and
Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre andSi-
don, which came to hear him, and to be healed of
their diseases; and they that were vexed with
unclean spirits; and they were healed.
And the whole multitude sought to touch him;
for there went virtue (healing effluence) out of
him, and healed them all.
And Jesus was constrained to repeat his for­
mer words, and said:
Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the kingdomof
God.
Blessed are ye that hunger now, for ye shall b
fe
filled.
Blessed are ye that weep now, for ye shall
laugh.
Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and
when they shall separate you from their company,
and shall reproach you, and cast out your nameas
evil, for a son of man’s sake.
But woe unto them that persecute you Jews is
my name. Their cities shall be laid waste, even
as they shall waste Jerusalem.
They will write testaments, falsely, in my name,
against my people, the Jews, that they may per­
secute them, and rob them. But it is not I that
write them, neither do I deliver them. 1know them
not, neither shall I know them.
Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy; for,
behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the
like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.
But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have re­
ceived your consolation.
Woe unto you that are full Efor ye shall hunger.
Woe unto you that laugh then! for ye shall
mourn and weep.
Woe unto you when all men shall, speak well of
you! for so did their fathers to the false prophete

audience of the people, he entered into Caper­
naum.
And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear
to him, was sick, and ready to die.
And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him
the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he
would come and heal his servant.
And when they came to Jesus, they besought
him instantly, saying, that he was worthy for
whom he should do this; for he loveth our nation,
and he hath built us a synagogue.
Then Jesus went with them. And when he was
not far from the house, the centurion sent friends
to him, saying unto him, Master, trouble not thy­
self, for 1am not worthy that thou »hould»t*enter
under my roof. Wherefore neither thought I my­
self worthy to come to thee; but say thou a word,
and my servant shall be healed.
For I am a man under authority, having sol­
diers under me; and I say to this man, Go, and he
goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and
to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to
them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have
not found so great faith, no* not in Israel.
And I say unto you, that many shall come from
the east and west, and shall sit down with Abra­
ham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heav-
en. ..•/gjfrafflB
And Jew and Gentile shall sit together, and
praise one Father. 1
Hut many of the children of the kingdom shall
be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.
And Jesus said unto the friends of the centu­
rion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so n
it don© unto thee.
And theservant washealed in the selfsame
hour. B
And when evenwascome, they brought unto
—*l—
himmany that were possessed with devils; and he
cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all
that were sick; that it might be fulfilled which
was spokenof Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself
tookour infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.
RAISING THE SON OF THE WIDOW OF NAIN
And it came to pass the day pfter, that he went
into a city called Nam, and many of his disciples
went with him, and much people.
Now whenhe came nigh to the gate of the city,
behold, there was a dead mancarried out, the only
su
t this mother, andshewas a widow; and much
people of the city was with her.
And when the master saw her, he had compas­
sion anher, and said unto her, Weep not.
And he came and touched the bier; and they
that bare himstoodstill. And he said, Young man,
I say unto thee, Arise.
Andhe that was dead sat up, and began to
speak. Andhe deliveredhimto his mother.
And there camea fear onall, and they glorified
God, saying, A great prophet is risen up among
us, and, God hath visited his people Israel.
And this rumor of him went forth throughout
Judea, and throughout all the region round about.
MESSAGE FROM JOHN THE BAPTIST
And the disciples of John shewed him all of I
these things.
And when John had heard in the prison the
works of Jesus, he sent two of his disciples, and
Mid unto him
, Art thou he that should come, or
do welookforanother?
And in that same hour Jesus cured many of
their infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits
and to many others that were blind he gave sight.
And he answered and said unto them, Go and
shew John again those things which ye do hear
and see.
The blind receive their sight, and the lame
walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear,
the dead are raised up, and thepoor have the gos­
pel preached tothem
.
I amhe that should com
e, and ye shall not look ,
f® another, to establish a king on earth. For now
^established the kingdomof heaven,
u But Israel shall be crucified and rejected, even
as | son of man must be nailed to a cross and re­
jected; for the people must suffer with their mes-
siah, that theword of Godmay be spread over the
fact of the earth, and the nations be converted.
Israel shall be scattered abroad, that it may be
a bgfot unto the Gentiles.
H And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be of­
fended in me.'
And. as they departed, Jesus began to say unto
tt|multitude concerning John, What went ye out
into the wilderness tosee?A reed shakenwith the
M
hd? \|SJ
rtut what went ye out to see? A man clothed in
Raiment? Behold, they that wear soft clothing
fn kings’ houses.
kit what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea,
■unto you, and more than I prophet.
‘or this is he of whomit is written, Behold, I
send my messenger before thy face, which s
fc
&
j,
prepare thy way before thee.
Verily I say unto you, Among them that -s
n
|
born of women there hath not arisen a greater
than John the Baptist; and he that is greatesf M
the kingdom of heaven is not greater than he.' '
And from the days of John the Baptist unp
now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence
andthe violent take it by force.
For all the prophets and the law propl&sigg
until John.
And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, rem
can**
ated, who was to come.
He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. ■ji
And all the people that heard him, and all tks
publicans, justified God, being baptized with tfcs
baptism of John.
But some of the pharisees and lawyers rejected
the counsel of God against themselves, being not
baptized of him.
And Jesus said, But whereunto shall 1likentbit
generation? It is like unto children sitting in the
markets, and calling unto their fellows, and say­
ing, We have piped unto you, and ye have not
danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have
not lamented.
For John came neither eating nor drinking; and
they say, He hath a devil.
A son of man came eating and drinking^andI
they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a wine-
bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners, iBut
‘wisdom is justified of her children.
WARNING TO CHORAZIN g B
Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein
most of his mighty works were done, because they
repented not:
Woe unto thee, ChorazinI Woe unto thee, Beth-
saida! For if the mighty works which were don*
in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they
would have repented long ago in sack cloth and
ashes.
But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable
for Tyre and Sidon in the day of their judgments
than for you.
And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto
heaven, shall be brought down to hell; for it the
mighty works which, have been done in thee had
been done in Sodom, it would have remained until
this day.
But I say unto you, that it shall be more toler­
able for the land of Sodom in the day of ito judg­
ment, than for thee.
At that time Jesus answered and said, 1thank,
thee, 0 Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because
what thou hast hid from the wise and pruder^'
thou hast revealed them unto babes.
Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in
sight
‘All things are delivered unto me of our E
S
er; and no man knoweth a son but the Father,
neither knoweth any man the Father save rapt,
and he to whomsoever a son will reveal him.
Come unto me, ye that labor and are heavy lsd
en, and I will give you rest.

PARABLE OF THE LEAVEN
Another parable spake he unto them: The king-
f
dom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman
took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the
whole was leavened.
All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude
in parables; and without a parable spake he not
1 unto them, that it might be fulfilled which was
* spoken of the prophets, saying, I will open my
mouthin parablesI will utter things which have
1 beenkept secret from the foundation of the world.
PARABLE OF THE CANDLE
And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to
be put under a bushel, or under a bed, and not to
be set on a candlestick ?
For there is nothing hid, which shall not be
!i manifested; neither was any thing kept secret,
1
1# but that it should come abroad.
If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear.
With what measure ye mete, it shall be measure
I
S ed to you. And unto you that hear shall more be
I given.
And he said, So is the kingdom of Cod, as if
| a man should cast seed into the ground, and
A should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed
il, should spring and grow up, he knovreth hot how.
M For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself;
S first the blade, then the ear; after that, the full
I com in the ear.
I-; But when the fruit is brought forth, immedi-
■ ately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest
I iscome.
PARABLES OF THE TREASURE, THE
PEARL, THE D R AW N E T
|
: . Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto trea-
I
* sure hid in a field, which when a man hath found,
he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selletn
all that he hath, and. buyeth that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a
I merchantman, seeking goodly pearls, who when he
I had found one pearl of great price, went and sold
I all that he had, and bought it.
# Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net
I that was cast into the sea and gathered of every
I kind, which, when it was full, they drew to shore,
I and sat down, and gathered the good into the
| vessels, but cast the bad away.
So shall it be at the end of a man’s life. The
angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked
from among the just; and shall cast them into the
furnace of fire. There shall be wailing and gnash­
ing of teeth.
PARABLE OF THE TARES
Another parable put he forth unto them, say­
ing,The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man
which sowed good seed in his field.
But while men slept, his enemy came and sow­
edtares among the wheat, and went his way.
But when the blade was sprung up, and brought
forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
So the servants of the householder came and
said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in
thy field? From whence then hath it tares?
He said unto them, An enemy hath done this.
The servants said unto him, Wilt thou that we
go and gather them up?
But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the
tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.
Let both grow together until the harvest; and
in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers,
Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them
in bundles to bum them; but gather the wheat
into my bam.
Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went
into the house; and his‘ disciples came unto him,
saying. Declare unto us the parable of the tares of
the field. ■
He answered and said unto them, He that
soweth the good seed is a son of man, the field is
the world, the good seed are the children of the
kingdom; but the tares are the children of the
wicked one.
The enemy that sowed them is the devil, the
harvest is the end of men’s lives, and the reapers
are the angels.
As therefore the tares are gathered and burned
in the fire, so shall it be in the end.
A son of man shall send forth his angels, and
they shall gather out of his kingdom all things
that offend, and them which do iniquity, and shall’
cast them into a furnace of fire. There shall be*
wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun
in the kingdom of their Father. -
Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Then said Jesus unto them, Have ye understood
all these things ? They said unto him, Yea, Master.
Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe
which is instructed into the kingdom of heaven,
is like unto a man that is a householder, which
bringeth forth out of his treasures things new and
old.
A PROPHET NOT HONORED IN HIS OWN
COUNTRY
And it came to pass, that when Jesus had fin­
ished these parables, he departed thence.
And when he was come into his own country,
he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that
they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this
man this wisdom, and these mighty works ?
Is not this the carpenter’s son ? Is not his moth­
er called Mary, and his brethren, James, and Joses,
and Simon, and Judas?
. And his sisters, are they not all with us?
Whence then hath this man all these things ?
And they were offended in him. But Jesus said
unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save
in his own country, and in his own hoijise.
And he did not mighty works there, because o f
their unbelief, save that he laid his hands upon a
few sick folk, and healed them.
And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And
he went round about the villages, teaching.
JESUS CALMS THE STORM
Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about
— 26—
him, he gave commandment to depart unto the
other side.
And a certain scribe came, and said unto him,
Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou
goest.
And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes,
and the birds of the air have nests; but a son of
naan hath not where to lay his head.
And another of his disciples said unto him,
Master, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
But Jesus said unto him, Follow me, and let the
dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the
kingdom of God.
And another also said, Master, I will follow
thee; but let me first go bid them farewell whicn
are at home at my house.
And Jesus said unto him, No man having put
his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for
the kingdom of God.
And when he was entered into a ship, his dis­
ciples followed him; and there were also with him
other little ships.
And behold there arose a great tempest, inso-,
much that the ship was covered with the waves.
And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep
on a pillow. And his disciples came to him, and
awoke him, saying, Master, save us; we perish.
And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful, O
ye of little faith ?
Then he arose and rebuked the winds and the
sea; and there was a great calm.
And the men marvelled, saying, What manner
o f man is this, that even the winds and the sea
obey him?
And Jesus answered, In ages to come, where
this is told, even they that call themselves by
my name will not believe my works, because they
themselves are not able to work them. Because of
their lack of faith, even as yours, and because of
their hypocrisy, and because of man’s inhu-
m a n it y to m an , they will not be able
to generate in themselves the virtue (healing ef­
fluence) to perform my miracles. But I say unto
you, Man is lord of nature. By their fruit ye shall
know them.
TH E GERGESENE SWINE
And when he was come to the other side, into
the country of the Gergesen&s, there met him a
man possessed with devils, coming out of the
tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might
pass that way.
And no man could bind him, no, not with chains;
because that he had been often bound with fet­
ters and chains, and the chains had been plucked
asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces;
neither could any man tame him.
And always, night and day, he was in the moun­
tains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting him­
self with stones.
But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and
worshipped him.
And behold he cried out, saying, What have we
to do with thee, Jesus, thou son of God? A rt thou
come hither to torment us before the time?
And Jesus asked him, W hat is thy name?
And he answered, saying, My name is Legion;
for we are many.
v And there was a good way off from there |
herd of swine, feeding.
So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast
us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.
And he said unto them, Go. And when they were
come out, they went into the herd of swine; and,
behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently dow
n,
a steep place into the sea, and perished ip the
waters.
And they that kept them fled, and went their
ways into the city, and told everything, and what
was befallen to the possessed of the devils. ^
And, behold, the whole city came out to m
eet
Jesus; and saw him that was possessed with the
devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and
in his right m ind; and they were afraid. -fl
And they began to pray Jesus to depart out of
their coasts, because that they were not Jews,
and he had destroyed their swipe; and there were
many possessed in their country. For in those days
and in that region were more possessed of spirits
than today.
But even to this day there are times, and terri­
tories, and persons, that are possessed, of other
personalities, which ye do exorcise even as did
Jesus.
And wtyen he was come into the ship, he that
had been possessed with the devil prayed him that
he might be with him.
Howbeit, Jesus suffered him not, for he was not
an Israelite; but said unto him, Go home to thy
friends, and tell them how great things the Lord
hath done for thee, and hath had compassion O
ft
thee.
And he departed, and began to publish in 11
capolis how great things Jesus had done for him;
and all men did marvel.
M IR A C LE S O F ISSU E OF BLOOD, AND
J A IR U S ’ D A U G H T E R
And it came to pass that when Jesus was re­
turned, the people gladly received him; for they
were all waiting for him.
And, behold, there came a man named Jairus,
and he was a ruler of the synagogue; and he fell
down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that he
would come into Tiis house; for he had one only
daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay
a dying.
But as he went, the people thronged him, and a
woman having an issue of blood twelve yean,
which had spent all her living upon physicians,
neither could be healed of any, came behind him
,
and touched the border of his garment; for she
said within herself, If I may but touch his gar­
ment, I shall be whole. And immediately her issue
of blood stanched.
And Jesus said, Who touched me?
When all denied, Peter, and they that were with
him, said, Master, the multitude throng thee, an
d
press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me!
And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched m

While he yet Spake, there came one from the
rular of the synagogue's house, saying to him,
fty daughter is dead; trouble not the master.
H
ut when Jesus heard it, he answered him, aa.\ -
lug, Fear not; believe only, and she shall be made
w

And when he came into the house, and saw the
m
instrels and the people making a noise, he said
pnto them

, save Peter, and James, and John, and the
father and the mother of the maiden.
And all wept, and bewailed her; but he said,
Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.
And they laughed at him, knowing that she was
dead.
And he put them all out, and took her by tho
hand, and railed, saying. Talitha cuini, Maid arise.
And her spirit came again, and she arose
straightway; and he commanded to give her meat.
And her parents were astonished; but he
charged them that they should tell no man what
was done.
And the fame hereof went abroad into all tl\e
land,
TWO BUND MEN AND THE DUMB SPIRIT
And when Jeaus departed thence, two blind men
followed him crying, and saying, Thou son oi
David, have mercy on us.
And when he came into the house, the blind men
cam
e to him, and Jesus said unto them, Believe ye
that I amable to do this ?They said unto him, Yea,
m
aster.
Then touched he their eyes, saying, According
to your faith be it unto you.
And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitiy
charged them, saying, See that no man know it.
But they, when they were departed, spread
abroad his fame in all that country.
As they went out, behold, they brought to him
a dumb man possessed with a devil.
And when the devil waa cast out, the dumb
spake; and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It
was never to seen in Israel.
But some of the priests of Herod said, He caat-
eth out devils through the prince of the devils.
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages,
teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the
gospel of tlie kingdom, and healing every sickness
andevery disease among the people.
And when he saw the multitudes, he was moved
w
ith compassion on them, because they fainted,
and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no
shesherd.
Then said he unto his disciples, The harvest tru­
ly it plenteous, but the laborers are few.
Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, tlmt
he will send forth laborers into his harvest,
MISSION OP TW ELVE APOSTLES
The twelve Jesus then sent forth, by two and
two, and commanded them, saying. Go not into the
way of the Gentiles, and into any city of thw
Samaritans enter ye not. (It is therefore false
when some say that the apostles went to the eitie*
of the Gentiles )
But go rather to tile lost sheep of the house of
Israel.
And, as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom o f
heaven is at hand.
HeaJ the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead,
cast out devils, Freely ye have received, freely
give.
Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass lit
your purses; nor scrip for your journey; neither
two coats; but be shod with sandals, and bear in
your hand a staff only; for the workman i#
worthy of his meat.
And in whatever city or town y t shall enter,
inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till yo
go thence.
And when ye come into a houce, salute It.
And if the house be worthy, let your peace come
upon it; but if it be not worthy, let your peace re­
turn to you.
And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear
your words, when ye depart out of that house os
city, shake off the dust of your feet.
Verily 1 say unto you, It shall be more toler­
able for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in tho
day of their judgment, than for that city.
Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst
of wolves. Be ye therefore wise as serpents, and
harmless as doves.
But beware of men; for they will deliver you up
to the councils, and they will scourge you in their
temples.
And ye shall be brought before governors am)
kings for my sake, for a testimony against them
and against the Gentiles*
But when they deliver you up, take no thought
how or what ye shall speak ; for it shall be given
you in that same hour what ye shall speak.
For it is not ye that speak , but the spirit of
your Father which speaketh in you.
And tho brother shall deliver up the brother to
death, and the father the child; and children *hall
rise up against their parents, and cause them to
be put to death.
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s
sake; but he that endureth to the end shall be
saved.
But when they persecute you in this city, Bee
ye to another; for verily 1 say unto you, Ye shall
not have gone over the cities of Israel, till a son
of man be coma.
The disciplo is not above his mastei, not the

And he said to his disciple*, Make them sit

Andthey did so, and made them all sit down.
Thenhe took the five loaves and the two fishes,
and linking up to heaven, he blessed them, and
brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the
m
ultitude.
And they did eat, and were all filled; and there
wastaken up of fragments that remained to them,
twelve baskets of apports.
Then those men, when they had seen the mir­
acle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that
prophet that should come into the world, and they
desired to make him king of the Jews.
WhenJesus therefore perceived that they would
com
eand take him by force, to make him a king,
heconstrained his disciples to get into the ship,
and to go to the other side unto Bethsaida, while
hesent away the people.
And when he had sent them away, he departed
intoa mountain to pray, and was there alone. And
there he prayed that God might take away the
tem
ptation that he become an earthly king.
JESUS WALKED ON THE WATER
And when even was come, his disciples went
down unto the sea, and entered into a ship, and
went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was
nowdark, and Jesus was not come to them.
And the sea arose by reason of a great wind
that blew.
So when they had rowed about five and twenty
orthirty furlongs, and in the fourth watch of the
night, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and
drawing nigh unto the ship; and they were afraid
and cried out, It is a spirit. For they considered
not the miracle of the loaves, for their heart was
hardened.
But he said unto them, Be of good cheer. It is I;
be not afraid.
And Peter answered him and said, Master, if it
bethou, bidme come unto thee on the water.
And he said, Come. And when Peter was come
down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to
p
>toJesus.
But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was
afraid; andbeginning to sink, he cried out, saying,
Master, save me.
And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand
andcaught him, and said unto him, O thou of little
fiith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
And when they were come into the ship, the
wind ceased.
Then they that were in the ship came and wor­
shipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art a son. of
God.
And when they were gone over, they came into
the land of Gennesaret.
Andwhen the men of that place had knowledge
ot him
, they sent out into all that country round
about, and brought unto him all that were diseas­
ed, and began to carry about m beds those that
were sick, and lay them, in the streets, and be­
sought hint that they might only touch the h*”
of his garment.
And as many as touched were made perfectly
whole.
DISCOURSE ON PLAIN AND IN SYNAGOGUE
The day following, when the people which stood
on the other side of the sea saw that there was
none other, boat there, save that one wherein*©
his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went
not with his disciples into the boat, but that his
disciples were goneaway alone (Howbeit there
ramp other boats from Tiberias, nigh unto the
place where they did eat bread, after that the
master had given thanks); when the people there­
fore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his dis­
ciples, they took shipping, and came to Caper­
naum, seeking for Jesus.
And when they had found him on the other side
of the sea, they said unto him. Rabbi, when earn­
est thou hither?
Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I
say onto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the
miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and
were filled.
Labor not for the meat which perisheth, b u M f l
that meat which endureth unto everlasting life,
which a son of man shall give unto yon; for him
hath God the Father sealed.
Then said they unto him, Wh^t shall we do, that
we might work the works of God?
Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the
work of God, that ye believe him whom he hath
sent.
They said therefore unto him, What sign shew-
est thou then that we may believe thee? What
dost thou work?
Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it
is written, He gave them bread from heaven to
eat.
Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I
say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from
heaven of which I speak; but our Father giveth
you the true bread from heaven.
For ye have the bread of God when one cometn
down from heaven, and giveth the promise of life
everlasting unto the world.
They said then unto him, Master, evermore give
us this bread.
And Jesus said unto them, I am as the bread of
life. He that cometh to me shall never nunger;
and he that bdieveth me shall never thirst.
But I said unto you, that some of you also have
seen me, and believe not.
All that our Father giveth me shall come Jew^;
and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast
aside. » ■
For my spirit eame down from heaven, not to
do mine own will, but the will of him that seat me.
jip* this is our Father’s will which Hath sent
Mh &at of ail which he hath destined for me I
slicuj losenotiuBf. but should see that it be rais­
ed up again after death.
And this is the will at him that sent me, that
every one that seeth a son of God and believeth
him
. may have everlasting life; that his spirit
may be raised again after death.
Thensomemurmured at Jesus, because he said,
1amas breadwhichcame down from heaven.
And they said. Is not thisJesus, the son of Jos­
eph, whose father and mother we know? How is it
then that he saith. I came down from heaven?
Fbr they knew not that the souls of all men
come down from heaven.
Jesus therefore answered and said unto them,
Murmur aot among yourselves.
No man cancom
e to me. except our Father
whichhathsentmedraw him; and his spirit shall
he raised up again after death.
It is written in the prophets. And they shall be
al taught of God.
Every mantherefore that hath heard, and hath
learnedof our Father, eometh unto me to hear the
fespeL
But not every man hath seen our Father, save
he which isof God, he hath seen our Father.
Verily, verily, 1say unto you, He that believeth
meshall have everlasting life; for my gospel is as
the bread of fife.
Our fathers did indeed eat manna in the wild­
erness. and the souls of many are dead. For every
man hath his last day, and every man hath his
day of judgment
But this is the bread which eometh down from
heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and his soul
notdie.
1 am as living bread which came down from
heaven. If any man eat of this bread, his soul
shall live for ever.
Andthe bread that I will give is as my flesh,
which 1will give for the life of the world.
Then some strove among themselves, saying,
How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
For they knew not that Jesus meant he would
teach them his gospel which was as bread and
meat —a promise of life after death.
Thus Jesus spoke in a parable, as was ever his
wont, and called his gospel his flesh and his blood.
FearJesus spokenot except in parables; and when
he also told his apostles that he was born of the
holy ghost, that he was a son of God, even that he
was a god, he spoke always in parables.
Let him that hath ears, understand.
Amihe said onto them, Verily:vaflf. i
you, Except ye eat the flesh of a sonat
drink his blood, ye have no life in you. |
Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my
hath eternal life; and he shall be raised ugcfcMnH
lastday.
Fhr my flesh is meat indeed, and my M
neofjjy
drink indeed.
He that eateth my flesh, anddrinketh
dwelleth in me, and I in him.
As our living Father hath sent me, and1w H
by our Father; so he that eateth of this tanaf
shall live for ever.
These things said he in the synagogueIpH H
taught in Capernaum.
Many therefore of his disciples, when they lad
heard this, said, This is a hard saying; w
h
r>
hear it?
But by this hard saying Jesus meant eventlM
his gospel would dwell in those that believedM
s*;,
and that their trust would dwell in him; evenas
God’s spirit dwelleth in the bodies of his dukhst,.
and their spirits in God.
When Jesus knew in himself that his <hsd|lm
murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth tls
offend you?
What and if ye shall see a son of manaseeodqp
where he was before?
It is the spirit that quickeneth, the fleshp d b
eth nothing. The body shall perish, but thesprit
shall live. The words that I speak unto you,H
are spiritual, they are life.
But there are some of you that believeait <

Jesus knew who they were that behoved not).
And he said, Therefore said I unto you thatMi
man can come unto me, except it were givenara
himof our Father.
From that time many of his disciples wenth
u
rt,
and walked no more with him. For they a d P
stood not his parables.
And many others of his disciples nusundersteal
his parables, for they understood them in a hteni
sense. And thus they misunderstand Jesus jfgM
unto this day.
Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will afeo|
|
away?
Then Simon Peter answered him, Master. |
|
whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of rtert*
a) life.
And we believe and are sure that thou art w
anointed, a son of the living; God.
PART 5
Third Year's Ministry
DISCOURSE ON POLLUTION
Then came toJesus some scribes and pharisees,
which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy
disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?
p r they wash not their hands when they eat
For the pharisees, and all the Jew*-. |ra|
they wash their hands oft, eat nut. hridunc •w

If f*shinf of cups, and pots, brazen vessels, and of
tables.
Fortheysay, Cleanliness is next to godliness.
ButJesus answered and said unto them, Why do
ye also transgress the commandment of God by
yourtradition?
For God commanded, saying, Honor thy father
andmother; and, He that curseth father and mo­
ther, let himdie the death.
But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father
orhis mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift,
by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;
andhonor not his father or his mother; he shall
befree.
And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his
father or his mother.
Thus have ye made the commandment of God
of cone effect by your tradition; and many such
like things do ye.
If you do make changes; then also do I make
changes; but the changes that I make are just.
Ye hypocrites! well did Esaias prophesy of you,
laying:
This people draweth night unto me with their
m
outh, and honoreth me with their lips; but their
heart is far from me.
But in vain they do worship me, teaching for
doctrines the commandments of men.
And he called the multitude, and said unto
them
, Hear, and understand. Not that which goeth
into the mouth defileth a man; but that which
eom
ethout of the mouth, this defileth a man.
Then came his disciples, and said unto him,
Knowest thou that those pharisees were offended,
after they heard this saying?
But he answered and said, I am come to offend
m
en; even you my own I offend; even all Israel I
offend; that ye and they may be purified.
Every plant which our Father that is in heaven
hathnot planted shall be rooted up.
Let them alone; they be followers of Herod;
theybe blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind
lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.
Then answered Peter, and said unto him, De­
clareunto us this parable.
And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without under­
standing?
Do not-ye yet understand, that whatsoever
entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and
iscastout in the draught ? But those things which
proceed out of the mouth come forth from the
heart; and they defile the man.
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,
m
urders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false wit­
n
ess, blasphemies, covetousness, wickedness, de­
ceit, lasciviousness, pride, foolishness, an envious
eye,
These are the things which defile a man; but to
eatwith unwaahen hands defileth not a man.
9 Kevertheless 1 say not that ye shall not wash.
11 ye wash not for God; ye wash for the cleanli-
of your own body.
H EALING THE SYROPHOENICIAN’S
DAUGHTER
Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the
coasts of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into a house,
and would have no man know it; but he could
not be hid.
And behold, a woman of Canaan, a Greek Syro-
phoenician by nation, came out of the same coasts,
and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O
Master, thou son of David! My daughter is griev­
ously vexed with a devil.
But he answered her not a word. And his
disciples came, and besought him, saying, Send
her away, for she crieth after us.
But he answered and said, I am not sent but
unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Then came she, and worshipped him, saying,
Master, help me!
But he answered and said, It is not meet to take
the children’s bread, and cast it to dogs.
And she said, Truth, Master. Yet the dogs eat
of the crumbs which fall from their master’s
table.
But Jesus answered again, I am come unto the
house of Israel, that the Gentiles may know that
I am one of them, that I also am a Jew and an
Israelite.
For when my disciples shall go forth into the
earth to preach this gospel, many of ye Gentiles
will accept me in name only, and for my miracles,
which I work,. Ye will call me, Lord, Lord, but ye
will do your will, not my will, nor the will of the
Father that sent me.
Because ye bear my name, and sit in my seat,
ye will think ye may do all manner of evil to my
people, whom ye shall have estranged through
false teachings, which I gave you not. Such are
the doctrines of men, not the doctrines of our
Father, which I now gitfe unto you.
I say unto you now, to be delivered unto that
day, Return to the heir his portion. Pay to the
Jews for the salvation ye receive from the Jews;
lest the Lord say unto you in that day, I will re­
pay.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every drop of
blood that ye shed in my name, it shall be exact­
ed of you, yea hundredfold.
Therefore am 1 not sent unto you, but unto my
own, for I know the evil that ye will do, falsely, in
my name, when ye have thrust out the rightful
heir, and have taken his inheritance.
Then the woman answered him, Are the Greeks
not also God’s children? And ye say that we sh&iip^
sit in thy seat, and call thee, Lord, Lord. Wilt thou
not therefore heal my daughter?
Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O wo­
man, thou sayest truly, All nations shall hear this
gospel and be converted.
Great is thy faith; therefore do 1 this deed for
thee; be it unto thee even as thou wilt. But do 9
also unto my people even as l do unto you. And l do
this, that wherever this deed be told, it may be ■
—81—
remembrance of these my words to the Gentiles.
And her daughter was made whole from that
very hour.
HEA U N G THE D E A F A N D DUMB
And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre
and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee,
through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis; and
went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
And they brought unto him one that was deaf,
and had an impediment in his speech; and they
besought him to put his hand upon him.
And he took him aside from the multitude, and
put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and
touched his tongue; and looking up to heaven, he
sighed, and said unto him, Ephphata, that is, Be
opened.
And straightway his ears were opened, and the
String on his tongue was loosed, and he spake
plain.
And he charged them that they should tell no
man; but the more he charged them, so much the
more a great deal they published it. and were be­
yond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all
things well. He maketh both the deaf to hear, and
the dumb to speak.
And great multitudes came unto him, having
with them those that were lame, blind, dumb,
maimed, and many others, and cast them down at
Jesus' feet; and he healed them, insomuch that
the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb
to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to
walk, and the blind to see. And they glorified the
God of Israel.
FE E D IN G T H E FOUR TH O U SAN D
Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and
said, I have compassion on the multitude, because
they continue with me now three days, and have
nothing to eat, and I will not send them away fast­
ing. lest they faint in the w ay; for divers of them
came from far.
And his disciples said unto him, Whence should
we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to
|i| so great a multitude?
And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves
have ye?
And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on
the ground.
And he took the seven loaves and the fishes,
and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to
his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
And they did all eat and were filled; and they
took up of the broken food that was left seven
baskets full of apports.
And they that did eat were four thousand men,
besides women and children.
And he sent away the multitude, and took ship,
and came into the coasts of Magdala.
SECOND P A R A B LE OF T H E L E A V E N
Then came to him some pharisees and saddu-
eees desiring that he would show them a sign from
heaven.
H t anwered and said unto them, When it is eve­
ning, ye say, It will be fair weather; for the a :,
is red.
And in the morning, It will be foul weather t*v
day; for the sky is red and lowering.
O ye hypocrites! ye can discern the face of th
e
sky, but can ye not discern the signs of the tim
es!
But what sign desire you? Discern not m
e, but
judge my doctrine. If my doctrine be true, th
en
is it from heaven, and ye require no further sign
from me.
A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh
after a sign; and there shall no sign be given o
n
t'>
it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.
And he left them, and departed; '
And when his disciples were come to the o
th
e?
side, they had forgotten to take bread; neither
had they in the ship with them more than onelost
Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed, and be­
ware of the leaven of those pharisees and saddu-
cees, and the leaven of Herod. (For Herod was a
secret enemy of the Jews.)
And they reasoned among themselves, for their
minds were simple, saying, It is because we have
taken no bread. Which when Jesus perceived, he
said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason
ye among yourselves, because ye have brought jw
bread?
Do ye not yet understand, neither remember th
e
five loaves and the five thousand, and how m
any
baskets ye took up?
How is it that ye do not understand and thatl
spake it not to you concerning bread, but that ye
should beware of the leaven, which is hypocrisy
of those pharisees and sadducees?
Then understood they how that he bade th
em
not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the hy­
pocrisy of some pharisees and sadducees, w
ho
were the servants of Herod and of his high
priests.
H E A L IN G OF TH E B LIN D MAN
And he came to Bethsaida; and they brought &
blind man unto him, and besought him to touch
him.
And he took the blind man by the hand, andled
him out of the town; and when he had spit onhis
eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him
if he saw ought.
And he looked up, and said, I see men and trees,
walking.
A fter that he put his hands again upon his eyes,
and made him look up. And he was restored, and
saw every man clearly.
And he sent him away to his house, saying,
Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in th
e
town.
For Jesus knew that his healing power was
drawing to an end, and that he must needs keep
power also for his passion. Therefore did he not
wish to heal any more, and charged thode whom
he healed to tell no man, that so many might n
o
t
come to him, to drgw from his virtue (healing
effluence).
PETER’S CONFESSION OF F A IT H
And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the
town* of Caesarea Philippi; and by the way he
i*ked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do
H
M
Dsay that I am ?
And they answered, John the Baptist;but some
say, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the
prophets.
For some believed in the resurrection of the
dt&d, in this manner; and others believed in the
transmigration of souls, in this way; while still
others believed in reincarnation.
And he said unto them, But whom say ye that
I am?
And Peter answered and said unto him. Thou
art the anointed, a son of the living God*
And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed
art thou, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood hath
not revealed it unto thee, but our Father which is
inheaven.
And he charged them that they should tell no
Danof him.
PREDICTION OF TH E PASSIO N
From that time forth began Jeaus to shew unto
his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem,
and suffer many things of the Romans, and be
crucified and be raised again.
Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him,
saying, Be it far from thee, Master. This shall
not be unto thee.
But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee
behind me, Satan. Thou art an offence unto me;
for thou savorest not the things that be of God,
but those that be of men.
Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Y e shall not
hinder me, but ye shall deliver me to the tree * for
therefore am I come. If I be not delivered to the
tree, the gospel of the resurrection o f the soul
shall not be preached to all nations.
If any man will come after me, let him deny
himself, and take up his burden, and follow me.
For whosoever will save hie life shall lose it;
and whosoever will lost his life fo r m y sake shall
find it.
For what is a man profited, if he shall gain
the whole world, and lose his own soul ? Or what
shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
Verily I say unto you, There be some standing
here which shall not taste of death, till they see a
son of man transfigured in his glory. For verily n
ion of man shall be transfigured, as the angels of
God.
Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed o f me,
end of my words. In this adulterous and Mnfui
generation, of him also shall a son o f m»ti be
eihsmed, when he riseth in his glory*
Ami God shall reward every man according to
his works.
THE T R A N S F K irR A T IO N
And it came to pass, six day a after these say­
ings, he took Peter and John and Janies, and went
up into a mountain.
And its he prayed, the fashion of his counte­
nance was altered, and shone as the sun, and his
raiment w ii white and ghitenitg as snow, so a#
no fuller • n earth can white them.
And, behold, there talked with him tw© men.
which were Moses and Elias who appeared in
glory, and spoke o f his decease which he should
accomplish at Jerusalem.
But Peter and they that were with him were
heavy with sleep, in a trance as it w ere; and whtn
they were awake, they saw clairvoyantly his
glory, and the two men that stood with him.
And it came to pass, as the materializations dis­
parted from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it
is good for us to be here; and let us make three
tabernacles — one fo r thee, and one for Moses,
and one for Elias. For he wist not what to say ;
fo r they were sore afraid.
W hile he thus spoke, there came a cloud, and
overshadowed them; and they feared as they en­
tered the cloud.
And there came a voice, clairaudiently, out of
the cloud, saying, This is my beloved son; hear
him.
And when the voice was past, Jesue was found
alone, and he came and touched them and said.
Arise, and be not afraid.
And they kept it close, and told no man in those
days any of those things which they had seen.
For as they came down from the mountain, he
charged them that they should tell no man wh**t
things they had seen, till a son o f man were rise**
from the dead.
And they kept that saying with themselves,
questioning one with another what the rising fros®
the dead should m ean;for they knew not
only the spirit should be resurrected.
And they asked him saying, W hy say the
scribes that Elias must first come?
And he answered and told them, Elias verU
cometh first, and restoreth all things;and how >
|
it written of a son of man, that he must sutiisi
many things, and be set at nought.
But I say unto you, that Elias is indeed a
and they have done unto him whatsoever they |
ed,a£ it is written o f him.
Then the disciples understood that he gpsj.
unto them o f John the Baptists
H E A L IN G TH E DEMONIZED GUILD
And it came to pass that on the next day. when
they were come down from the hill, much ;>eopie
met him.
And when he came to his other
he saw a great multitude about them, and some
scribes questioning with them
And straightway all till* people, when they be­
held, were greatly amazed; and running to hu
»uiuted him.
And he asked the scribes, W hat question
with them ?
And one of the multitude answered and said.
Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which
hath a dumb spirit
And wherever he taketh him, he teareth him;
and he foameth and griasheth with his teeth, and
pineth away; and 1 spake to thy disciples that
thty should oust himout:and they couldnot.
lie answered him, and said, 0 faithless gener­
ationt How long shall I bo with you? How long
shall 1suffer you? Bring him unto ms.
And thty brought him unto him; and whtn ho
saw him, straightway the spirit tore him; und ho
fill on the ground, and wallowed foaming.
And he asked his father, How long is it ago
lines this cams unto him?
And he said, Of a child. And ofttlmes it hath
cast him into the firs, and into the waters, to des­
troy him. But if thou canst do anything, have
compassion on us, and help us.
Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all
things are possible to him that believeth.
And straightway the father of the child cried
out, and said with tears, Master, 1 believe; help
thou my unbelief.
When Jesus saw that the people came running
together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying untie
him, Thou dumb and deuf spirit, I charge thee,
come out of him, and enter no more into him.
And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and
came out of him. And he watt aa one dead; inso­
much that many said, He li dead.
But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him
up;and he arose.
And when he was come into the house, hie dis­
ciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast
him out?
And he said unto them, Because of your unbe­
lief; lop verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as
a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this
mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and It
shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to
you. Howbeit this kind can come forth by nothing
but prayer and fasting. But there is also a natural
power of healing and miracle-working. Borne there
be that are bom with it, but others must acquire
it.
SECOND PREDICTION OF THE PASSION
And they departed thence, and passed through
Galilee; and he would not that any man should
know it,
And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto
them, A son of man shall be delivered into the
hands of man, and they shall hang him to a tree,
but he shall be raised again. And they were ex­
ceeding sorry, though they understood not that
saying, and it was hid from them, that they per­
ceived it not, and were afraid to ask him.
THE COIN IN THE FIHH'H MOUTH
And when they were come to Capernaum, they
that received tribute money came to Peter, and
•aid. Doth not your master pay tribute? He
eatih. Yes.
And when he was come into the house, Jesus
•aid unto him, What thinkest thou, Simon? Of
whom do the kings of the earth take custom or
tribute? Of their own children, or of strangers?
Peter said unto him. Of strangers.
Jeeue said unto him, Then are the children free.
Ntdwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go
thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and tak
fish that first cometh up; and when thoti
opened hts mouth, thou ahalt find ■ ■
money. Take that, and give it unto them
*, fop ml
and thee.
A LESSON ON DOCILITY
Another time, being in a house in Capernaum,
he asked hie disciples, What was it ve disputas
among yourselves by the way? For he had u>r
ceived the thought of their heart.
But they held their peace; for by the way they
had disputed among themselves who should b* tin
greatest.
And he sat down, and called the twelve, n
ut
said unto them, 1f any man desire to be first, 11
same shall be last of all, and servant of all, for h*
that is least among you all, the sume shall be
great.
And Jesus called a little child unto him
, a
rid
set him in the midst of them, and when he had
taken him in his arms, he said, Verily, I say unto
you, Except ye be converted, and become as lithe
children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom O
f
heaven.
Whoaoever therefore shall humble himself ah
a little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom
of heaven.
And whoso shpll receive one such little childin
my name, receiveth not me alone, but him that
sent me.
And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of
these little ones a cup of cold water only, In the
name of a disciple, verily, I say unto you, he shall
in no wise lose his reward.
But whoso shall offend one of these little ones
which believe in me, it were better for him that»
millstone were hanged about hie neck, and that he
were drowned in the depths of the sea.
Woe unto the world because of offences! For
it must needs be that offences come; but woe tv
that man by whom the offence cometh l
Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thw,
cut them off, and cast them Iiom thee. It Isbetter
for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather
than having two hands or two feet, to be cast in
t.>
Gehenna, where their worm dieth not, andthe fire
is not quenched.
And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, und
cast it from thee. It is better for thee to enter Into
life with one eye, rather than having two eyas,
to be cast into Gehenna, where their v>ormdlcih
not, and the fire is not quenched.
For every one shall be salted with fire, and every
sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
Sait is good; but if the salt have lost it# ult*
ness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt In
yourselves, and have peace one with another.
Take heed that ye despise not one of these little
ones; for I. say unto you, that in heaven their
/spirits do always behold the face of our Fathw
which is in heaven.
For 1 eon of man in come to save that w
hich
woe lost.

When he had said these words unto them, he
abode still in Galilee.
But when his brethren were gone up, then went
he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it
were in secret.
Then many sought him at the feast, and said.
Where is he?
And there was much whispering among the
people concerning him; for some said, He is a good
man; others said, Nay, but he deceiveth the
people.
Howbeit no man spake openly of him, for fear
of the Romans.
Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up
into the temple, and taught.
And many marvelled, saying, How knoweth this
man letters, having never learned?
Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is
not mine, but his that sent me.
If any man will do his will, he shall know of the
doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak
of myself.
He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own
glory; but he that seeketh his glory that sent him,
the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
Did not Moses give you the law ? And yet none
of you keepeth the law.
Moses gave unto you circumcision (not be­
cause it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and ye
on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
If a man on the sabbath day receive circumci­
sion, that the law of Moses should not be broken;
are ye angry at me, because I have made a man
every whit whole on the sabbath day?
Judge not according to the appearance, but
judge righteous judgment.
Then said some of them, Is not this he, whom
Herod seeketh to kill ?
Then answered Jesus, Why go some about to
kill me?
The people answered and said, Thou art out of
thy mind. Who goeth about to kill thee?
Jesus answered and said unto them, 1 have
done one work, and ye all marvel.
Then answered others, But, k>, he speaketh
boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the
rulei s know indeed that this is a messiah ?
Howbeit we know this man whence he is; and
when the messiah cometh, no man knoweth
whence he is.
Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught,
saying. Ye both know me, and ye know whence I
an.. And I am not come of myself, but he that
sent me is true, whom ye know not.
But I know him; for I am from him, and he
hath sent me.
Then the Herodians sought to take him.
But the Jews hid him, and no man laid hands on
him. oecause his hour was not yet come.
And many of the Jews believed on him, and
•aid. When a messiah cometh, will he do more
miracles than these which this man hath done?
And the spies of the Herodians hearing that
the people whispered such things concerning him.
again sent Gauls to take him, but they I
find him.
Then said Jesus unto the people. Yet a f£ 3 H
while am I with you, and then I go unto him zhtf- 1
sent me.
Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; an
d
where 1 am, thither ye cannot come.
Then said the Jews among themselves, YYhithw
will he go, that we shall not find him? Will heg
r,
unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach
the Gentiles?
What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye
shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where
I am, thither ye cannot come?
Now, in the last day, that great day of thefesstt
Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thim,
let him come unto me, and drink.
He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath
said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
water.
(But this spake he of the spirit, which they
that believe on him should receive; for the spirit
of truth was not yet given to his disciples, because
that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
Many of the people, therefore, when they heard
this saying, said, Of a truth this is a prophet, I
Others said, This is a messiah. But a few said,
Shall a messiah come out of Galilee?.Hath notthe
scripture said, that a messiah cometh of the seed
of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where
David was ?
So there was a division among the people be­
cause of him, fomented by the spies; but no m
an
laid hands on him.
Then came the officers of the two high priests
of Herod to the chief priests and pharisees; an
d
the officers said unto them, Why have ye not
brought him?
And they answered, Never man spake like thjj
man.
Then said the officers, Are ye also deceived?
Have any of the rulers believed on him? Only the
people who knoweth not the law, are deceived.
Then Nicodemus said unto them (he that cam
e
to Jesus by night, being one of them); Doth our
law judge any man before it hear him, and know
what it doeth ?
They answered and said unto him, Art thoualso
of Galilee? Search and look; for out of Galilee
ariseth no prophet.
And every man went unto his own house, ana
Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
THE ADULTERESS
And early in the morning Jesus came again inte
the temple, and all the people came unto him; and
he sat down and taught them.
And some scribes and pharisees brought unto
him a woman taken in adultery; and when they
had set her in the midst, they said unto him.Mu­
ter, this woman was taken in adultery, in thevery
act.
Now Moses in the law commanded us that s
u
e
should be stoned; but what sayest thou?
But Jesus stooped down, and with his fingn*

• i^g answered and said unto then, Why
herein is a marvelous thing’, that ye know not
from whence he is, and yet he hath opened my
eyes. Now we know that God heareth not sinners;
but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doth
his will, him he heareth. Since the world began
was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of
one that was born blind. If this man were not of
G
od, he could do nothing.
They answered and said unto him, Thou art al­
together born in sins, and dost thou teach us?
And they left him.
Jesus heard all this, and when he had found
him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on a
son of God?
He answered and said. Who is he, Master, that
I might believe on him?
And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen
him
, and it is he that talketh with thee.
And he said, Master, 1 believe. And he worship-I
ped him.
And Jesus said, For judgment 1 am come into
thisworld, that they which see not might see; and
that they which make believe they see might be
declared blind.
And some which were near hint heard these
words, and said unto him in their pride. A re we
blindalso?
Jesus said unto them, I f ye were blind, ye
should have no sin; but now ye say, W e see.
Therefore your sin remaineth.
SHEPHERD
__lyou, He that ententh
not by the door into the aheepfokl, but climbeth
upsome other way, the same is a thief and a rob­
ber.
But he that entereth in by the door is the shep­
herdof the sheep.
To him the porter openeth, and the sheep hear
his voice, and he calleth his own sheep by name,
aadleadeth them out.
And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he
foeth before them, and the sheep follow him; for
they know bis voice.
And a stranger will they not follow, but will
flee fnun him; for they know not the voice o f
strangers.
This parable spake Jesus unto them, but they
understood not what things they were which he
spake unto them.
Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily,
i sayunto you, I am the door of the sheep.
U ny that ran* before me were as thieves and
robbers; but the sheep did not hear them.

MISSION OF THE SEVENTY
After these tinpp the master apprinhad c b er
seventy also; and sent them iron and tw> before
his face into every city and place, whisher be ban
self would come.
Therefore said he onto them, The harvest a d jr
is great, but the laborers are few. Pray ye there­
fore the Lord of the harvest, that he weudd read
forth laborers unto his harvest,
Go year ways. Beheld, I send you fu r* as iambs
among wolves.
Cany neither parse, nor scrip, aar shoes; and
salute no naan by the way.
And into whatever bouse ye ester, fu st sag.
Peace be to this bouse.
And if the sou of peace be there, j w r peace
shal rest upas it ; if | p it g n s m * to M
And in the gaSje house resaaon, eetaug a n
drinking such things as they give; far Bhe lsiunar
is worthyH H a H r a Go net from bouse to banto.
And into whatsoever d ty H ember, I they aar
drive you, H aueh things as are I before you.
And head the akh that ate therein, uad any uuin
them, The kingdom of God is corns nigh unto you.
But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they
receive you not, go your ways out into the streets
of the same, and say, Even the very dust of your
city, which cleaveth on us, wu do wipe off against
you. Notwithstanding, be ye sure of this, that the
kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.
But 1 say unto you, that it shall be more toler­
able in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
And again ho upbraided the cities:
Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Beth-
saida! For if the mighty works had been done in
Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you,
they had a great while ago repented, sitting in
sackcloth and ashes.
But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon
at the judgment, than for you.
And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to
heaven, Shalt be thrust down to hell!
He that heareth you, heareth m e; and he that
despisetb you, despiseth me; and fie that despis-
eth me, despiseth him that sent me.
And after many days the seventy returned
again, saying, Master, even the devils are subject
unto us through thy name.
And he said unto them, 1 beheld Satan as light*
ning fall from heaven.
Behold, 1 give unto you power to tread on ser­
pents and scorpions, and over all the power of the
enemy;and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
Notwithstanding, in this rejoice not, that the
spirits are subject unto you; but rather, rejoice
because your names are written in heaven.
In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I
thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
that thou hast hid these things from the wise and
prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even
so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.
Ail things are delivered to me of our Father;
and no man knoweth who a son is, but our Father;
and who our Father is, but a son, and he to whom
a son will reveal him.
And he turned him unto his disciples and said
privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the
things that ye see.
For 1 tell you that many prophets and kings
have desired to see those things which ye see, and
have not seen them ; and to hear those things
which ye hear, and have not heard them.
PARABLE OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN
And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up and said,
Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
He said unto him, What is written in the law?
How readest thou ?
And he answering, said, Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
soul, and with ail thy strength, and with all thy
mind;and thy neighbor as thyself.
And he said unto j-him, Thou hast answered
right. This do, and thou shalt live.
But he, willing to justify himself, said unto
Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
And Jeau* answering, said, A certain man went
down from Jerusalem to Jerico, and fell among
thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, ^
wounded him, and departed, leaving him
dead.
And by chance there came down a certain pdut
that way; and when he saw him, he passed by
the other side.
And likewise a levite, when he was at the place,
came and looked on him, and passed by on the
other side.
But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, corn
®
where he was, and when he saw him, he had com
,
passion on him, and went to him, and bound up hlg
wounds, pouring in oil, and wine, and set him on
his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took
care of him.
And on the morrow when he departed, ht.,\
took out two pence, and gave them to the host,
and said unto him, ^Take care of him; and what*
soever thou spendest more, when 1 come again,
1 will repay thee.
Which now of these three, thinkeit thou, w
aa
neighbors unto him that fell among the thiavos?
And he said, He that shewed mercy on him
,
Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou like*
wise.
VISIT TO MARY AND MARTHA
Now it came to pass, as they went, that he
entered into a certain village; and a certain wo*
man, named Martha, 'received him into her house.
And she had a sister called Mary, which alio
sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard his word.
But Martha was cumbered about much serving,
and came to him and said, Master, dost thou not
care that my sister hath left me to serve alone?
Bid her therefore that she help me.
And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha,
Martha, thou art careful and troubled with m
any
things. But one thing is heedful, and Mary hath
chosen that good part, which shall not be taken
away from her.
LORD’S PRAYER
And it came to pass, that as he was praying in
a certain place, when he ceased, one of h
isdis*
ciples said unto him, Master, teach us to pray, as
John also taught his disciples.
And he said unto them, When ye pray, say:
Our Father, the One in heaven,
Halloaed be thy name, thy kingdom come,
Th y will be done on earth as in heaven.
Give us this day that which we need.
Forgive us our sins as we forgive sinners.
Lead us from temptation, deliver us from evil.
Amen!
And he said unto them, Which of you shall have
a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and
say unto him, Friend, lend mo three loaves; fora
friend o f mine in his jourm y is come to me, u
rn! j
have nothing to set before him?
And he from within shall answer and gay,
Trouble me not;the door is now shut, and my chip
dren are with me in bed. 1 cannot rise and give
thee.
1say unto you, Though he will not rise and give
—40—
be is his friend, yet because of hi*
fci* ho xrill rise and give him as many as
unto you, Ask, and it shall be given
g L i aad ye shall find. Knock, and it shall be
onto you.
^ i r every one that asketh receiveth, and he that
hadeth. and to him that knocketh it shall
wcpeaed. . _ , „ )
if a son shall ask bread o f any o f you that is a
Asker, v i he give him a stone? O r if he ask a
jSTwifl he for a fish give him a serpent? O r If
wshsB ask aa egg, will he offer him a scorpion?
It ye then, being evil, know how to give good
efts ante your children, how much more shall
war heavenly Father give the holy spirit to them
that ask him?
DISCOURSE IN J U D E A
la the mean time, when there w ere gathered
together an innumerable multitude o f people inso-
■■ch that they trod one upon another, again to
the people of Judea Jesus repeated many of his
sayings;
No man when he hath lighted a candle, putteth
it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on
a candlestick, that they which come in m ay see
the light
The light of the body is the ey e ; therefore when
thine eye is frank, thy whole body also is full o f
h*ht; but when thine eye is evil, thy body is fu ll
flf darkness.
Take heed, therefore, that the ligh t which is in
thee be not darkness.
ifthy whole body therefore be full o f light, hav­
ing no part dark, the whole shah be fu ll of light,
as when the bright shining of a candle doth giv e
thee light
And as he spake, a certain pharisee besought
has to dine with him ; and he w ent in, and sat
down to meat
And when the pharisee saw it, he m arvelled that
he had not first washed before dinner.
Now Jesus washed as other men when his hands
wen not dean, but on this occasion he washed nor.,
for be desired to utter a parable, as was his cus­
tom, when he was invited to dinner.
And the master said unto him, N ow do some
of ye pharisees make clean the outside o f the cup
andthe platter; but the inside part is fu ll o f rav-
fnfflff and wickedness.
Fools, did not he that made that which is with­
out make that which is within also?
Bather let them give alms of such things as
(hey have; and, behold, all things shall be clean
mo them.
Bet woe unto them! for they tithe m int and rue,
md all manner of herbs, and pass over judgm ent
asd the love of God; these ought they to have
done, and not to leave the other undone.
Woe unto them! fo r they love Die uppermost
mats Bthe synagogue, and greetings in the m ar­
ket.
Woe onto then, hypocrites! fo r they are graves
vfckfc appear not, and the men that walk over
than are not aware of them.
Then answered one of the lawyers, and said un­
to him. Master, thus saying thou reproaehest ua
also.
And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyer^!
for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne
and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one
o f your fingers.
W oe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the
prophets, and your fathers killed than.
Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of
your fathers; for they indeed killed them, and ye
build their sepulchres.
W oe unto you, law yers! fo r ye have taken away
the key of knowledge. Y e entered not in your­
selves, and them that were entering in ye hinder­
ed.
Verily 1 say unto you, It shall be required of
this generation.
And as he said these things unto them, the
lawyers began to urge him vehemently, and to
provoke him to speak many things, lying wait
for him, and seeking to catch something out of
his mouth that they might accuse him.
For this is the business of lawyers, even unto
this day; and they send the martyrs to prisons
and to deaths, that they themselves may gain hon­
ors and riches.
And they multiply the law's, that every man
may be a breaker of the laws; but they them­
selves escape through the loopholes which they
themselves cunningly have devised.
And when he was come out from meat, he said
to his disciples, Beware o f hypocrisy.
For there is nothing covered* that shall not be
revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.
Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in dark­
ness shall be heard in the light; and that which
ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be pro­
claimed upon the housetops.
And I say unto you my friends,Be not afraid of
them that kill the body, and after that have no
more that they can do.
But I will forewarn you whom y e shall fear;
Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power
to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.
Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings,
and not one of them is forgotten before God.
But even the very hairs o f your head are all
numbered. Fear not therefore; ye are of more
value than many sparrows.
And when they bring you unto the temples, and
unto the magistrates, and powers, take ye no
thought how or what things ye shall answer,
or what ye shall say, for the holy ghost shall teach
you in the same hour what ye ought to say.
Therefore I say unto you. Fear not!
T H E RICH FOOL
And one of the company that had gathered to­
gether said unto him, Master, speak to my broth­
er, that he divide the inheritance with me.
And he said unto him, Man, who made me B
judge or a divider over thee?
And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware
o/ covetousness; for a man's life consisteth not
of the abundance of the things which he possess­
ed .
And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The
ground o f a certain rich man brought forth plen­
tifully.
And he thought within himself, saying, What
shall 1do, because 1have no room where to bestow
my fruits?
And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my
barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow
all my fruits and my goods.
And i will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much
goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat
drink, and be merry.
But God said unto him, Thou fool! this night
thy soul shall be required of thee; for the soul is
mine. Then whose shall those things be, which
thou hast provided?
So is he that layeth up treasure for himself,
and is not rich toward God.
And he said unto his disciples, Therefore 1 say
onto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye
shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put
on.
The life is more than meat, and the body is
more than raiment.
Consider the ravens; for they neither sow nor
reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn;
and God feedeth them. How much more are ye
better than the fowls!
And which of you with taking thought can
add to his stature one cubit?
If ye then be not able to do that thing which is
least, why take ye thought for the rest?
This spake he not for all men, but only for those
whom he had chosen to preach his gospel. For
pome of them looked back to the fleshpots they
had forsaken for his sake.
And he continued, Consider the lilies, how they
grow! They toil not,they spin not; and yet 1 say
unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not
arrayed like one of these.
If God then so clothe the grass, which is today
in the field, and tomorrow is cast into the oven,
how much, more will he clothe you, O ye of little
faith?
And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye
shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.
For all these things do the nations of the world
set-k after; and your Father knoweth that ye have
|£p of these things.
But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all
tnese things shall be added unto you.
Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's
good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
Those who receive not the kingdom of God in
the flesh on earth, they shall receive it in the
spmt in heaven, for the resurrection is the life of
PSie H
Sell that ye have, and give aims. Provide your­
selves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the
o a o v t i a that faileth not, where no thief ap-
plf jftroacheth, neither moth corrupteth.
For where your treasure is, there will jour
be also.
Let your loins be girded about, and year
burning; and ye yourselvevs like unto mm
wait for their lord, when he will return, from v,
wedding; that, when he cometh and knocked?
they may open unto him immediately.
Blessed are those servants, whom the bn!
when he cometh, shall find watching. Verily 1<*.
unto you, that he shall gird himself, and rn
g
fe
g
them to sit down to meat, and will come forth taj
serve them.
And if he shall come in the second watch, vf
come in the third watch, and find them so, bless,
ed are those servants.
And this know, that if the goodman of thehw*t
had known what hour the thief would com
e, bp
would have watched, and not have suffered
house to be broken into.
Be ye therefore ready also; for a son of ro
&
u
cometh at an hour when ye think not. For verily,
he cometh to every man with the angel of death.
Then Peter said unto him, Master, speaker
thou this parable unto us, or even to all?
And Jesus said, Who then is that faithful aa|
wise steward, whom his lord shall make rulerover
his household, to give them their portion of m
e
t>
t
in due season?
Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, win*
he cometh, shall find so doing.
Of a truth 1 say unto you, that he will auk
him ruler over all that he hath.
But and if that servant say in his heart, ||
lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to ben
the menservants and maidens, and to eat aid
drink, and to be drunken; the lord of that servsfy
will come in a day when he looketh not for him
,
and at an hour when he is not aware, andwill co*
him in sunder, and will appoint him his port#*!,
with the unbelievers.
And that servant which knew his loin’s *$
S
L
and prepared not himself, neither did accordingis
his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.
But he that knew not, and did commit
worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stfip
For unto whomsoever much is given, of himsn
ail
be much required; and to whom men have com
­
mitted much, of him they will ask the more.
1 am come to send fire on the earth; and *h»;
will I if it be already kindled ?
But I have a baptism to be baptized altfc:
and how am I straitened till it be accom
plished
Suppose ye that I am come to give peace ywt
earth ? 1 tell you, N a y ; but rather division.
For from henceforth there shall be five iaj&jg|
house divided, three against two, and two against
three.
H ie fath er shall be divided against the »oe,
and the son against the father; and the
against the daughter, and the daughter agatndt
the m other; the mother-in-law against S
daughter-in-law, and the daughter in-law against
her mother-in-law.
And he said also to the people, When n i n i
God came, and the scripture cannot be broken, say
ye of him, whom our Father hath sanctified, and
sent into this world, Thou blasphemest; because
I said, I am a son of God?
1 said not that I am God. Of myself 1 am noth­
ing.. But it is not that which I am, but that which
generations to come shall believe that I am. My­
self I am but a son of man, yet generations to
come shall indeed worship me as a god. For it is
written, Ye are gods.
Then some murmured still more, not under­
standing his meaning, and he said, If I do not the
works of our Father, believe me not.
But if 1do, though ye believe not me, believe the
works; that ye may know, and believe, that our
Father is in me, and I in him.
And the Gauls of Herod sought again to take
him, because of his saying that he was a messiah;
but he escaped out of their hand; and went away
beyond Jordon into the place where John at first
baptized; and there he abode.
And many Jews resorted unto him, and said,
John did no miracle, but all things that John
spake of this man were true.
And many believed on him there.
THE CLOSED DOOR
Then said one unto him, Master, are there few
that be saved ?
And he said unto them, Strive to enter in at the
strait gate;for many, I say unto you, will seek to
enter in, and shall not be able.
When once the master of the house is risen up,
and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand
without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord,
Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say
unto you, I know you not, whence ye are; then
shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in
thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.
But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not
whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of
iniquity.
There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,
when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
arid all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and
y.*i yourselves thrust out.
And they shall come from the east, and from
the west, and from the north, and from the south,
aiid shall sit down in the kingdom of God.
And, behold, there are last which shall be first,
aiid there are first which shall be last.
MESSAGE TO HEROD
The same day there came certain of the phari­
sees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart
hence; for Herod will kill thee.
For the-company of the pharisees and all the
body of the Jews were one with Jesus, and wished
to save him that he might deliver the nation from
tin Romans and from Herod; but a few were hyp­
ocrites and the spies and servants of Herod.
And be said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox,
Behold, 1cast out devils and 1 do cures today and
tomorrow, and before the third day I shall be
through. » t
Nevertheless, I must work today, and Utmof
and the day following I will leave;for it
that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killeth
prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto
thee; how often would I have gathered thy child­
ren together, as a hen doth gather her broodund.
er her wings, and ye would not!
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate;
and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see m
e,
until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed h
he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
HEALING MAN WITH DROPSY
And it came to pass, as he went into the house
o f one of the chief pharisees, to eat bread on the
sabbath day, that they watched him.
And, behold, there was a certain man before
him, which had the dropsy.
And Jesus spake unto the lawyers, saying, Is
it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? And they
held their peace.
And he took him, and healed him, and let him
go.
And he said to the lawyers, Which of you shall
have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and willnot
straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?
And they could not answer him again to these
things.
PARABLE OF THE GREAT SUPPER
And he put forth a parable to those which w
ere
bidden, when he marked how they chose out the
chief rooms; saying unto them:
When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding
sit not down in the highest room, lest a more hon­
orable man than thou be bidden of him; and he
that bade thee and him, come and say to thee,
Give this man place; and thou begin with sham
e
to take the lowest room.
But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in
the lowest room; that when he that bade thee
cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up hiyif
er. Then shalt thou have worship in the presence
of .them that sit at meat with thee.
For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abat­
ed ; and He that humbleth himself shall be exalted
Then said he also to him that bade him, When
thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy
friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen,
nor thy rich neighbors; lest they also bid thee
again, and a recompense be made thee.
But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the
maimed, the lame, the blind; and thou shalt b»
blessed, for they cannot recompense thee, but ttwo
shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of tne
just.
And this saying standeth unto this day, evea
against the pharisees that call themselves byJe­
sus’ name and consider themselves holier thanthe
pharisee of the Jews. For do they not all.! yea, 1
say all, call their friends, and their brethren, and
their kinsmen, and their rich neighbors to their
dinners and their suppers; but call not the poor,
the maimed, the lame, and the blind?

PARABLE OF THE PH ARISEE A N D TH E
PU B LIC AN
And he spake this parable unto certain which
trusted in themselves that they were righteous,
and despise others:
Twomen went up into the temple to pray; the
onea pharisee, and the other a publican. /
The pharisee stood and prayed thus with him­
self:God, I thank thee that I am not as other
m
en are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even
as this publican. I fast twice in the week, 1 give
tithes of all I possess.
And the publican, standing afar o ff, would not
lift upso much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote
upon his breast, saying, God be merciful unto me
a sinner.
I tell you this man went down to his house jus­
tified rather than the other; for every one that
exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that
humbleth himself shall be exalted.
QUESTION OF D IVO R CE
Then certain pharisees came unto him and ask­
ed,Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ipr
everycause?
And he answered and said unto them, Have ye
not read, that he which made them at the begin­
ning, made them male and female, and said, For
this cause shall a man leave father and mother,
andshall cleave to his wife, and they twain shall
beoneflesh?
Wherefore they are no more twain, but one
flesh. What therefore God hath joined together,
let noman put asunder.
They said unto him, Why did Moses then com­
mand to give a writing of divorcement, and to put
heraway? ,
He said unto them, Moses, because of the hard-
ness of your hearts, suffered you to put away your
wives; but from the beginning it was not so.
And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away
his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall
marry another, committeth adultery; and whoso
marrieth her which is put away for fornication
doth commit adultery.
And if a woman shall put aw ay her husband
except for fornication, and be m arried to another,
thecommitteth adultery.
His disciples said unto him, I f the case o f the
m
an beso with his w ife, it is not good to m arry.
But be said unto them, A ll men cannot receive
this saying, save they to whom it is given.
For there are some eunuchs, which w ere so bora
from their mother’s wom b; and there are some
eunuchs, which were made eunuchs o f m en; and
there be eunuchs, which have made themselves
eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He
that is able to receive it, let him receive it.
KINGDOM OF GOD
And when he was demanded of the pharisees,
when the kingdom of God should come, he answer­
ed them and said:
The kingdom of God cometh not with observa­
tion. Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, Lo there!
For, behold, the kingdm of God is within you.
And he said to his disciples, The days will come,
when ye shall desire to see one of the days of a
son of man, and ye shall not see it.
And they shall say unto you, See here; or. See
there!
Go not after them, nor follow them. For as the
lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part
under heaven; so shall also a son of man be in hia
day. .
But first must he suffer many things, and be
rejected of his generation. kg . | - - -
And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall ft be
also in the days of a son of man.
They did eat, they drank, they married wives,
they were given in marriage, until the day that
Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and
destroyed them all.
Likewise also as it was in the days of L o t; they
did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they
planted, they builded.
I But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom,
it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and des­
troyed them all.
Even thus shall it be when a son of man is re­
vealed.
In that day, he which shall be upon the house­
top, and his stuff in the house, let him not come
down to take it away. And he that is in the field,
Ilee him likewise not return back.
Remember Lot’s wife.
Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose
it, and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve
it.
I tell you, in that night there shall be two men
in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other
shall be left.
Two women shall be grinding together; the one
shall be taken, the other left.
And they answered and said unto him, Where,
Master? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the
body is, thither will the eagles be gathered to­
gether.
But none understood that Jesus spoke of the
Roman eagles that would gather together to des­
troy Jerusalem.
JESUS BLESSES THE LITTLE CHILDREN
And they brought unto him also infants, that be
would touch them and pray; but when his disciples
saw it, they rebuked them.
But Jesus was much displeased and called them
unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come
unto me, and forbid them not; for of such Is the
kingdom of God.

PREDICTION OF TH E FASHION
And they were in the way going to Jerusalem;
sadJesus went before them; and they were amaz­
ed;sod as they followed they were afraid.
And Jesus took the twelve disciples apart in the
way, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to
Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the
prophets concerning a son of man shall be aocom-
fished.
For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and
shall be mocked, and spitefully treated# and spit­
tedon.
And they shall scourge him, and hang him to a
tree; and before the third day he shall rise again.
And they understood none of these things; and
this saying was bid from them# neither knew they
the things which were spoken.
For Jesus had not confided in his apostles, but
it hisfriends that were in Jerusalem, ,
REQUEST OF JAMES AND JOHN
Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's chil­
dren, and with her sons, worshipping him# and
desiring a certain thing of him.
And he said unto her, What wilt thou?
She said unto him# Grant that these my two
smu may git, the one on thy right hand# and the
other on the left, in thy glory.
But Jesus answered and said# Ye know not what
yeask Are ye able to drink o f the cup that I shall
drinkof# and to be baptized with the baptism that
lam baptized with?
They said unto him, W e are able.
And he said unto them, Y e shall drink indeed of
my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that 1
am baptized with; but to sit on my right hand,
andon my left# is not mine to give, but it shall be
even to them for whom it is prepared of our
Father,
Now Jesus knew that ail his apostles would for­
sake him
# and that none of them understood his
dKtnoe, but would deliver it in corrupt logia after
that he was gone. Therefore answered he as he
d
a
d
.
And when the ten heard it, they were moved
with indignation against the two brethren.
But Jesus called them unto him and said, Ye
bear that the princes of the Gentiles exercise
dammion over them# and they that are great exer-
cat authority upon them.
Bet it shall not be so among you; but whoso­
ever will be great among you, let him be your mm-
bur.
And whosoever will be chief among you, let him
be ymr servant, even as a son of man cometh not
|to be ministered unto, Iwt to minister, and to give
his life a ransom for tauny.
HEALING OF BAKTIMAEGS
And as they departed from Jemo, a great mul­
titude followed him.
And, behold# two blind men, sitting by the way
side, when they heard that Jesus of Nazareth
passed by, cried out, saying# Have mercy on us,
0 Master# thou son of David,
And one of them was Bartimaeus, the son of
Timaeus, and he sat by the high way side, begging.
And the multitude rebuked them, because they
should hold their peace. But they cried the more,
saying, Have mercy on us# 0 Master# thou son of
David!
And Jesus stood still, and commanded them to
lie called. And they called the blind men# saying
unto them, Be of good comfort, rise; he eaileth
you,
And they casting away their garments# rose#,
and came to Jesus, and Jesus said, What will ye
that 1 shall do unto you?
They said unto him, Master, that our eyes be
opened.
Bo JesuK had compassion on them# and touched
their eyes# and said# Receive your sight; your
faith hath saved you.
And immediately their eyes received sight, and
they followed him, glorifying God; and ah the
people when they saw it, gave praise unto God.
VISIT TO ZACCHAEUH
And Jesus entered and passed through Jerico.
And# behold# there was a man named Zaeehaew#
which was the chief among the publicans# and he
was rich.
And he sought to see Jesus# who he was; a«d
could not for the press, because he was little of
stature.
And he ran before# and climbed up into a syca­
more tree to see him;for he was to pass that way.
And when Jesus cameto the place# he looked up,
and saw him, and said unto him, Zacehaeus, make
haste, and come down# for today l must abide at
thy house.
And he made haste, and came down, and receiv­
ed him joyfully.
And when they saw it# they all murmured# say­
ing that he was gone to be guest with a man that
was a sinner.
And Zacehaeus stood# and said unto Jesus, Be­
hold# Master, the half of my goods 1 give to the
poor;and if 1 have taken any thing from any man
by false accusation# I restore him fourfold.
And Jeans said unto them# Thisday is salvation
come to his house# forasmuch as he also is a son
of Abraham,
For a son of man is come to seek and to save
that which was lost.
PARABLE OF THE TALENTS
And as they heard these things# he added and
spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem,
and because they thought that the kingdom of
God should immediately appear.

And a very g rea t m rititode of Jews giread ma:

tom e te tbe feast, when they bad heard thniriK
was eoming to Jerusalem , cat down tosa*B
palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and
Strewed them in the way.
And the multitudes that went before, and that
followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of
DavidI Blessed is he that cometh in the name of
the Lord! Peace in heaven, and hosanna in the
highest!
And when he was come nigh, even now at the
descent of the mount o f Olives, the whole multi­
tude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise
God with a loud voice, fo r all the mighty works
that they had seen.
But some of the Herodians from among the
multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy dis­
ciples.
And he answered and said unto them, I tell you,
that if these should hold their peace, the stones
would immediately cry out.
And when he was come near, he beheld the city,
and wept over it, saying, If thou hadst known,
even thou, at least in this thy day, the things
which belong unto thy peace! But now they are
hid from thine eyes.
For the days shall come upon thee, that thine
enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and com­
pass thee around, and keep thee on every side.
And shall lay thee even with the ground, and
thy children within thee. And they shall not leave
in thee one stone upon another, because thou
knewest not the time o f thy visitation.
And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the
city was moved, saying, Who is this?
And the multitude said, This is Jesus, the pro­
phet of Nazareth o f Galilee.
THE CURSED FIG TREE
And when Jesus had looked round about upon
allthings, and now the eventide was come, he went
out unto Bethany with the twelve; and lodged
there.
Now in the morning as he returned into the
city, he saw a fig tree in the w ay, and found
nothing thereon, but leaves only, fo r the tim e o f
figs was not yet, and Jesus said unto it, L e t no
fruit grow on thee henceforward fo r ever. M ayest
thou wither even as the fig tree o f Romulus, as
a sign of the fall of Rome. A nd presently the fig
tree withered away.
And when the disciples saw it and understood
not the saying o f Jesus, th ey m arvelled, saying,
How soon is the fig tree w ithered a w a y !
Jesus answered and said unto them, V erily, I
say unto you, I f ye have faith, and doubt not, ye
shall not only do this which is done to th e fig tree,
but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be
thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, it
shall be done.
And all things whatsoever ye shall ask in pray­
er, believing, ye shall receive.
SECOND C L E A N S IN G O F T E M P L E
And Jesus went into the tem ple o f God, and cast
out all them that sold and bought in the temple,
and overthrew the tables o f tire moneychangers,
and the seats o f them that sold doves, and would
not suffer that any man should carry any vess
house of prayer; but ye have made it a den o'
thieves.
And the blind and the lame came to hir.;in the
temple; and he healed them.
And when Caiaphas and the Herodians saw the
wonderful things that he did, and the children
crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the
son of David! they were sore displeased, ami said
unto him, Hearest thou what they say ? And Jesus
said unto them, Yea. Have ye not read, Out of the
mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast perfect­
ed praise?
And they sought how they might destroy him,
but they feared him, because all the Jews were
astonished at his doctrine.
And they said to the pharisees to incite them
against Jesus, Perceive ye how ye prevail noth­
ing? Behold, the world is gone after him.
But they could not find what they m ight do;
for all the Jews were very attentive to hear him.
And all the sects listened to Jesus. For in those
days it was not as it is today. In those days there
were sects among the Jews. Some of those sects
were called pharisees, and sadducees; and there
were also the scribes. But these sects were not
many, being only a very small portion among the
Jews. And when Jesus speaketh against the hypo­
crites in these sects, he speaketh not of the great­
er part; and he speaketh not at all against the
greater mass of the Jews who received and follow­
ed him gladly. For Jesus was a Jew of the Jews.
So when Caiaphas and Ananus saw the temper
of the Jews, they were afraid;and they sent mes­
sengers to Herod that he come to Jerusalem with
soldiers, lest the Jews rise in revolution under
Barabbas, and make Jesus king.
THE LESSON OF THE FIG TREE
And when even was come, he went out of the
city. And in the morning, as they passed by, they
saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.
And Peter, calling to remembrance, said unto
him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cura-
edest is withered away!
And Jesus, answering, said unto them, Have
faith in God.
For verily I say unto you again, that whosoever
shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and
be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in
his heart, but shall believe that those things
which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have
whatsoever he saith.
Therefore I say unto you, What things soever
ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive
them, and ye shall have them.
And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have
ought against any; that your Father also which
is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.

THE TRIBUTE MONEY
Then went the Herodians, and took counsel h ow
they might entangle him in his talk.
iAnd they watched him , and sen t fo rth spies,
which should feign them selves ju s t m en, th a t
they might take hold o f his w ords, th a t so th e y
might deliver him unto th e p ow er and a u th o rity
of the governor. A nd am ong these spies w as th e
other disciple that sought to accuse P e te r a t th e
trial.
And they sent to him th e ir spies, sayin g, M as­
ter, we know that thou a rt tru e, and teach est th e
way of God in truth, n eith er carest thou fo r a n y
man, for thou regardest not th e person o f m en.
Tell us therefore, W h a t th in k est thou ? Is it
lawful to give tribute unto C aesar, o r n ot? S hall
we give, or shall w e not g iv e ?
Now they knew th at Jesus as w ell as a ll th e
Jews were enemies o f th e trib u te.
But Jesus perceived th e ir craftin ess, and said,
Why tempt ye me, y e h yp ocrites ? S h ew m e th e
tribute money.
And they brought unto h im a penny. A n d he
said unto them, W hose is this im a g e and super­
scription?
They said unto him, C aesar’s.
Then said he unto them , R en d er th e re fo re unto
Caesar the things which a re C aesar’s, and unto
Godthe things that are G od’s.
When they heard these w ords, th e y m arvelled ,
and left him, and w ent th e ir w a y ; fo r 't h e y could
sot take hold o f his w ords b efore th e Jew s.
And he said unto his disciples, The penny shall
not always bear the image and superscription of
Caesar.
SADDUCEES QUESTION OF THE
RESURRECTION
The same day came to him some sadducees,
whichsay that there is no resurrection, and asked
him, saying:
Master, Moses said, If a man die leaving no
children, his brother shall m arry his wife, and
raise up seed unto his brother.
Now there were with us seven brethren; and
the first, when he had m arried a wife, deceased,
and, having no issue, left his wife unto his broth­
er.
Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the
seventh.
And last of all the woman died also.
Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife shall
die be of the seven, for they all had h er?
Jesus said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing
diescriptures, nor the power of God.
The children of this world m arry, and are given
inmarriage.
Bat they which shall be accounted worthy to ob­
tain that world, and the resurrection from the
dead, neither marry, nor are given in m arriage,
hot they are as the angels of God in heaven; they
arethe children of God.
They have not bodies of flesh and blood, b u t
they are spiritual, neither can they die any m ore.
And as touching the resurrection of the dead,
have ye not read th a t which was spoken unto you
in th e bush by God, saying, I am the God of
A braham , and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob ? God is not the God of the dead, but of th e
living, for all live unto him. The bodies are dead,
and crumbled to dust, but the spirits of Abraham
and Isaac and Jacob live in heaven.
The resurrection is of the soul not of the body;
and the day of judgm ent cometh daily to every
m an as he dieth. ^ g
And when the m ultitudes heard this, they w ere
astonished a t his doctrine.
And certain of the scribes answ ering said, Mas­
ter, thou hast well said.
Now the scribes and pharisees were also gather­
ed together when he had put the sadducees to
silence, and perceiving th a t he had answered them
well, one of them which was a lawyer, asked him
a question, saying:
M aster, which is the great commandment in th e
law ?
Jesus said unto him, The first of all the com­
m andm ents is , Hear, O Israel;Yhwh our God is
One. And thou shalt love Yhwh thy God w ith all
th y heart, and with all thy soul, and with all th y
mind, and with all thy strength.
This is the great and first commandment. A nd
the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love th y
neighbor as thyself.
There is none other commandment greater th a n
these.
On these two commandments hang all th e law'
and the prophets.
And the scribes said unto him, Well, M aster*
thou hast said the tr u th ; for there is one God, an d
there is none other but he.
And to love him w ith all the heart, and w ith all
the understanding, and w ith a l l t h e s o u l ,
and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor
as himself, is more than all whole b u rn t offerings
and sacrifices.
And when Jesus saw th a t he answered discreet­
ly, he said unto him, Thou a rt not fa r from th e
kingdom of God.
TEN COMMANDMENTS
Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said,
The&e are the ten com m andm ents:
1. Thou shalt not have other gods before Yhwh g
for Yhwh thy God is One, w ithout mother, con­
sort, or son.
2. TTiou shalt not bow down or worship before an y
image.
3. Thou shalt not invoke the name of Yhwh th y
God in vain.
4. Thou shalt not toil on the seventh day, but sh a lt
labor six days, and also observe the feast of un­
leavened bread, the feast of weeks, and th e h ar­
vest thanksgiving. Likewise shall ye cultivate th e
earth six years, but the seventh shall the poor
take all the fruits of the earth. And every seventh
year, thou shalt release thy debtor.
^ sad let him watch while the others do eat.
shad be weeping and gnashing o f teeth.
May are called, but few are chosen.

flea vent the Herodians, and took counsel how
ggr Slightentangle him in his talk.
<Ud they watched him, and sent forth sides,
thkh should feign themselves ju st men, that
3 3 might take hold of his words, that so they
sight defoer him unto the power and authority
«£ the governor. And among these spies w as the
Lac sought to accuse Peter at the
Aal they sent to him th e ir spies, saying, Mas­
ter.ve know that thou a rt true, and teachest the
v*t of God in truth, n either carest thou for any
m for thou regardest not th e person of men.
Ttfi as therefore. W h a t thin kest thou? Is it
h«M to give tribute unto Caesar, or n o t? Shall
ve give, or shall w e not g iv e ?
Now they knew that Jesus as well as all the
Jews were enemies of the tribute.
Bit Jesus perceived th e ir craftin ess, and said,
Ik y tempt ye me, y e h yp ocrites? Shew me the
taftite money.
And they brought unto him a penny. And he
sod into them, Whose is this image and super-
serptxn?
Theysaid unto him,Caesar’
s.
fhaa said he unto than. Render therefore unto
Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto
Gedtbe things that are God’s.
When the;- beard these words, th e y m arvelled,
a d kft him, and went their w a y ; fo r th e y could
m take bold of his words before th e Jew s.
Aid he said unto his disciples, T h e penny shall

SADDUCEES QUESTION OF THE

The resurrection is of the soul not of the body;
and the day of judgment eometh dally to every
man as he dieth.
And when the multitudes heard this, they were
astonished at his doctrine.
And certain of the scribes answering said, Mas^

Now the scribes and pharisees were also gather­

This is the great and first commandment. And
the second is like unto it, Thou shah love th y
neighbor as thyself.
There is none other commandment greater than
these.
On these two commandments hang all the law
and the prophets.
And the scribes said unto him, Well, M ister,
thou hast said the tru th ; for there is one God, and
there is none other but he.
And to love him w ith all the heart, and with all
the understanding, and w ith a l l t h e s o u l ,
and w ith all the strength, and to love his neighbor
as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings,
and sacrifices.
And when Jesus saw th at he answered discreet­
ly, he said unto him. Thou a rt not far from th e
kingdom of God.
TEN COMMANDMENTS
Then Jesus turned to his diadpies and said.
These a re th e ten commandments:
L Thou shah not have other gods before Yhwh*
for Yhwh thy God is One, without mother, con­
sort, or son.
2. Thou shalt not bow down or worship before an y
image.
i Thou shalt n e t invoke the nam e of Yhwh th y
God in vain.
4. Thou shalt not toil on th e seventh day, b u t sh a lt
labor six days, and also observe Hie feast of un­
leavened breed, the feast of weeks, and th e h ar­
vest thanksgiving, likew ise shaB ye e A h s h th e
earth m years, b a t the seventh shall th e pear
take ah th e fru its of the earth. And every a n e d h
year, then shalt release th y debtor.

For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father
which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what
I should say. and what I should speak.
And I know that his commandment is life ever­
lasting.
Whatsoever 1 speak therefore, even as the
Father said unto me, so 1 speak.
PREDICTION OF DESTRUCTION OF
JERUSALEM
And again Jesus went out and departed from
the temple; and his disciples came to him to shew
him the buildings of the temple.
And one of his disciples said unto him, Master,
see what manner of stones and what buildings are
here!
And some spake of the temple itself, how it was
adorned with goodly stones and gifts.
And Jesus answering, said unto him, Seest thou
these great buildings ? There shall not be left one
stone upon another, that shall not be thrown
down.
And when they had come to the mount of Olives,
as he sat there, over against the temple, Peter
and James and John and Andrew asked him pri­
vately, Tell us when shall these things be? And
what shall be the sign when all these things shall
be fulfilled?
And Jesus answering them, began to say, Take
heed that no man deceive you.
For many shall come in my name, saying, I am
the messiah; and shall deceive many.
And here Jesus prophesied of Vespasian,
whom many considered to be a messiah, and the
siege of Jerusalem by the Romans. But the dis­
ciples understood him not.
And ye shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
See that ye be not troubled, for all these things
must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
For nation shall rise against nation, and king­
dom against kingdom; and there shall be famines,
and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places,
and fearful sights and great signs shall there be
from heaven.
All these are the beginning of sorrows.
But take heed of yourselves, for then shall they
deliver you up to councils to be afflicted, and shall
kill you; and in the temples ye shall be beaten; and
ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for
my sake, for a testimony against them, and
against the Gentiles; and ye shall be hated of all
nations for my name's sake.
But when they shall lead you, and deliver you
up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall
speak, neither do ye premeditate; but whatsoever
shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye; for
it is not ye that speak, but the holy ghost.
For 1will give you a mouth and wisdom, which
all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay
nor resist.
Now the brother shall betray the brother to
death, and the father the son; and children shall
rise up against their parents, and shall cause them
to be put to death.
But there shall not a hair of your heads perish.
In your patience possess your
But those that come after you, and go t
j
Gentiles, they shall perish, and they shall wtfkf
all manner of evil, for my name’s sake.
And then shall many be offended, and ^
tray one another, and shall hate one another.
And many false prophets shall arise, and ihaft
deceive many.
And because iniquity shall abound, the love of
many shall wax cold. » -fl
But he that shall endure unto the end, the sam
e
shall be saved.
And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preach­
ed of my disciples in all the world for a witness
unto all nations.
And then shall the end of Jerusalem come.
When ye, therefore, shall see Jerusalem com
­
passed with armies and the abomination of deso­
lation spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing
where it ought not (whoso readeth, let him under­
stand), then let them which be in Judea flee into
the mountains. For wheresoever the carcase is,
there will the eagles be gathered together. .
■
And let them which are in the midst of it depart
out, and let not them that are in the countries
enter thereinto.
Let him which is on the housetop not com
e
down to take anything out of his house.
Neither him which is in the field return back
to take his clothes.
And woe unto them that are with child, and to
them that give suck in those days!
But pray ye that your flight be not in the
winter, neither on the sabbath day.
For there shall be great tribulation, such as was
not since the beginning of the world to this tone,
no, nor ever shall be.
For these be the days of vengeance, that all
things which are written may be fulfilled
For there shall be great distress in the land,
and wrath upon the people.
And they shall fall by the edge of the sword,
and shall be led away captive into all nations;mid
Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles
until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
And there shall be uppn the earth distress of
nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves
roaring; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and
for looking after those things which are com
ing
on the earth.
And except those days shall be shortened, them
should no flesh be saved; but for the elects’
sake those days shall be shortened.
Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is
the messiah, or there,' believe it not
For there shall arise false messiahs, and
false prophets, in the mountains as well as in
Jerusalem, and shall shew great signs and wond­
ers ; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall
deceive the very elect.
And a son of man shall be there, but he shall be
hidden, even from his own, though his voice shall
be heard unto the very end.
But take ye heed, behold, 1 have foretold H
vi things* .
Kftjgflbrt if they shall say unto you, Behold,
Puk in the desert; go not forth. Behold, he is in
secret chambers; believe it not.
for as the lightning cometh out of the east, and
j^ineth even unto the west; so shall also the com-
•
V
+
*ot a son of man be.
PREDICTS HIS RETURN TO JERUSALEM
immediately after the tribulation o f those days
sh
a
llthe sun be darkened, and the moon shall not
Iher light, and the city shall be covered with
___ Ism
oke and ashes of destruction. The stars
*4] fromheaven, and the powers o f the heav­
iesshall be shaken.
And then shall appear the sign of a son o f man,
h heaven and on all the hill tops around the city.
A
ndthere shall not be wood enough to lift up the
b
odiesof them that are crucified.
And then shall all the tribes of earth mourn for
th
efall of Jerusalem.
[ And they shall see the spirit o f a son of man
ascending to the douds of heaven, with power and
great glory.
! And heshall send his angels with a great sound
| of atrumpet; and they shall gather together the
sods of his elect from the four winds, from one
en
dof heaven to the other; all they that hang on
thecrosses, and they that lie in graves, and they
dudhe in toe streets unburied, and they that rot
a toe valleys and in cellars; their souls shall rise
atthe sound of the trumpet, and together with a
ns of man they shall enter into the kingdom o f
heaven.
When Jesus had spoken these words, he said,
Now learn a parable o f the fig tree. When his
branchis yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye
bo* that summer is nigh.
So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these
things, know that it is near, even at the doors.
Verily 1say unto you, This generation shall not
piss, tinall these things be fulfilled.
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my
w
ords shall not pass away.
But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no,
n
ot the angels of heaven, neither a son, but our
Fitheronly.
But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the
ron
iin
g of a son of man be.
For as in the days that were before the flood,
theywere eating and drinking, m arrying and giv-
og in marriage, until the day that Noe entered
oto toe ark, and knew not untO the flood came,
mdtook them aU away; so shall also the coming
da sonof man be.
Then shall two be in the field ; the one shall be
fckea, and the other left.
Two women shall be grinding at the m ill; the
«e shall be taken, and the othe*: left.
W
atch therefore, for ye know not what hour
parmaster doth come.
Bit know this, that if the good man o f the'
had known in what watch the thief would
j he would have watched, and would not have
affered his house to be broken into.
Therefore, be ye also ready; for in such ao.
hour as ye think not, a son of man cometh.
Take ye heed, watch and pray;for ye know not
when the time is.
Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your
hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunk­
enness, and cares of this life, and sothat day corner
upon you unawares.
For as a snare shall it come on all th«m that
dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch,
ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be ac­
counted worthy to escape all these things that
shall come to pass, and to stand before mion of
man.
For a son of man is as a man takingj u f e r jo u r ­
ney, who left his house, and gave authority to
his servants, and to every man his work, and com­
manded the porter to watch.
Who then is a faithful and wise servant whom
his lord hath made ruler over a household, to give
them meat in due season?
Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, when he"
cometh, shall find so doing.
Verily 1 say unto you, that he shall make hint
ruler over all his goods, ?
But and if that evil servant shall say in hi*
heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall be­
gin to smite his fellow servants, and to eat and
drink with the drunken; the lord of that servant,
shall come in a day when he looketh not for him,
and in an hour that he is not dware of, and shall
cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with,
the hypocrites.
There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Watch ye therefore ye know net when the
master of the house cometh, at even, or at mid­
night, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning‘
lest coming suddenly, hje find.you sleeping.
And what 1 say unto you, %§ay- unto all, Watch..
PARABLE OF TEN VIRGINS
And again Jesus delivered a parable, saying:
Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened
unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went
forth to meet the bridegroom,,
And five of them were wise, and five were
foolish.
They that were foolish took their lamps, and
took no oil with them.
But the wise took oil in their vessels with their
lamps.
While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumber­
ed and slept
And at midnight there was a cry made. Behold,
the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their
lamps.
And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of
your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest
there be not enough for us and you; but go ye
rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
And while they went to buy, the bridegroom
came, and they that were ready went in with him
to the marriage;and the door was shut.
Aftor— r* came also the other virgins, saying',
U rd, Lord, open to us.
Bet he answered and said, Verily I say onto
you, 1 ksov you not.
Watch therefore. for ye know neither the day
nor the hour wherein a son o l nan oonieth.
SECOND PARABLE OF THE TALEN TS
Andmgam he said, For the kingdom o f heaven
is as a man travelling into a fur country, who
called his own servants, and delivered unto them
his goods.
And*into one he gave five talents, to another
two, and to another one; to every man according
to |iis several ability; and straightway took his
journey.
Then he that had received the five talents went
and traded with the same, and made them other
five talents.
And likewise he that had received two, he also
gained other two.
Jfcit he that had received one, went and digged
in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.
After a long time, the lord o f those servants
came, and reckoned with than.
And so he that had received five talents, came
and brought other five talents, saying. Lord, thou
deliveredst unto me five talents; behold, I have
gained beside them five talents more.
His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good
and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over
a few things, I will make thee ruler over many
things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
He also that had received two talents, came, and
said. Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents;
behold, I have gained two other talents beside
them.
His lord said unto him, Well done, good and
faithful servant Thou hast been faithful over a
few things, 1 will make thee ruler over many
things. Enter thou into the joy o f thy lord.
Then he which had received the one talent,
came, and said. Lord, I know thee that thou art a
hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and
gathering where thou hast not strawed. And 1 was
afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth.
Lo, there thou hast that is thine.
His lord answered and said unto him, Thou
wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that 1
reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have
not strawed. Thou oughtest therefore to have put
my money to the exchangers, and then at my com­
ing I should have received mine own with interest
Then he said unto his servants, Take therefore
the talent from him, and give it unto him which
hath ten talents, for unto every one that hath
•hall be given, and he shall have abundance; but
from him that hath little, shall be taken away
even that which he hath.
And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer
darkness.
There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Then shall he answer them, saying, Verilylay

And these shall go away into deserved punish­

SESSION OF THE MOCK SANHEDRIM
And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished
all these sayings, he said unto his disciples, fl
know that after two days is the feast afpasawer.
and a son of man shall be betrayed to be lunged
to & tree. For he knew that his hour was cote
that he should be raised on the cross.
And he took Judas apart and said unto bin, (k
thou to Caiaph&s the high priest of llerod, and*&
of him thirty pieces of silver for me; and 1 1
should ask thee, Who sent thee? say, Jesus hM
sent me. And if he inquireth more of thee, say
wiH shew thee where he abideth.
And Judas understood not the intent of Jena,
and went and did as he was commanded. AndS
came unto Caiaphas and said. Give me o n
pieces of silver for my master.
And Caiaphas asked him. Who is thy master*
And Judas replied as he had been instructed.
Thep Caiaphas and Ananus and the h BB
were glad, and convenanted to give him tk
Afterward came also the other virgins, saying,
Lord. Lord, open to ns.
But he answered and said, Verily 1 say unto
yon, 1 know you not.
Watch themipjre, for ye know neither the day
nor th a W irA erein a son of man cometh.
SECOND PARABLE OF THE TALENTS
Aiuimg&ut he said, For the kingdom of heaven
is as a man travelling into a far country, who
called his own servants, and delivered unto them
his goods.
And unto one he gave five talents, to another
two, and to another one; to every man according
to his several ability; and straightway took his
jm & fiey. '■
Then he that had received the five talents went
and traded with the same, and made them other
five talents.
And likewise he that had received two, he also
gained other two.
But he that had received one, went and digged
in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.
After a long time, the lord of those servants
came, and reckoned with them.
And so he that had received five talents, came
and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou
deliveredst unto me five talents; behold, I have
gained beside them five talents more.
His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good
and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over
a few things, I wiU make thee ruler over many
things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
He also that had received two talents, came, and
said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents;
behold, I have gained two other talents beside
them.
His lord said unto him, Well done, good and
faithful servant. Thou hast been faithful over a
few things, 1 will make thee ruler over many
things. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
Then he which had receded the one talent,
came, and said, Lord, I know thee that thou art a
hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and
gathering where thou hast not strawed. And I was
afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth.
Lo, there thou hast that is thine.
His lord answered and said unto him, Thou
wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I
reap where I sowed not, and gather where 1 have
not strawed. Thou oughtest therefore to have put
my money to the exchangers, and then at my com­
ing I should have received mine own with interest.
Then he said unto his servants, Take therefore
the talent from him, and give it unto him which
hath ten talents, for unto every one that hath
shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but
from him that hath little, shall be taken away
even that which he hath.
And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer
darkness.
There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
THE SHEEP AND THE GOATS
And Jesus continued, When a son of man shall
rise in his glory, and all the holy
then shall he sit upon the ihri
And before him shall be gather
and he shall separate them one from t
shepherd divideth his sheep from the goat*
And he shall set the sheep on his right |
but the goats on the left.
Then shall the king say unto them on his m
hand, Come, ye blessed of our Father, inlierifg
kingdom prepared for you from the foundatiqh,
the world.
For I was a hungered, and ye gave me m
eat;
was thirsty, and ye gave me drink;I was a sir
er, and ye took me in ; naked, and ye clothed|
I was sick, and ye visited me. 1 was in prison,d

Then shall the righteous answer him, say ,

Or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw |
thee a stranger, and took thee in? Or naked, a.

prison, and came unto thee?
And the king shall answer and say unto thei
Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have li
it unto one of the least of these my brethren,s
have done it unto me.
Then shall he say also unto them on the ie
hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into Gehenn
prepared for the devil and his angels.

Then shall they also answer him, saying, L

Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily 1§

least of these, ye did it not to me.
And these shall go away into deserved punif

<
v
]| ,,sik any thing in m y name, I will do
if ve love me* keep my commandments.
And 1 will pray our Father and ho shall give
* mother comforter, th at he may abide with
•Jr j'or ,)Verj even the spirit of truth, whom the
world cannot receive* because it sooth him not,
neither knoweth him But ye know him, for he
dweileth with you, and shall be with you.
And the apostles asked, Who is he that dwelleth
with us? Show us this com forter.
And Jesus answered, 1 have told you already
that it is the spirit of truth, which is the holy
ghost. He it is that setteth men free from doubt
and error. Some there be th a t are born with him,
andothers may receive him. He dwelleth in others
andhe dwelleth in me, therefore 1 say, Xwill not
leave you comfortless; I will oome to you.
(But the apostles were as the sects; they had
not spiritual vision. Unless they saw with the
eyes, they understood not. They could not under­
stand that there is a quality of truth which no
man seeth with mortal eye, and they could not
believe unless they saw with their eyes.)
And Jesus continued, Yet a little while, and the
world seeth me no m ore; but ye shall see me. Be­
cause 1live, ye shall live also.
At that day ye shall know that I am in our
Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
He that hath my commandments, and keepeth
then, he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth
m
e shall be loved of our Father, and I will love
him
, and will manifest myself to him.
Judas, not Iscariot, said unto him, Master, how
isit that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and
not unto the world?
Jesus answered and said unto him, 1 withdraw
from the world for a time, and none shall see my
face but they that love me.
For in you have I developed a clairvoyant vi­
sion; therefore have I chosen you.
If a man love me, he will keep my words; and
ou
r Father will love him, and we will come unto
h
im
, and make our abode with him.
He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings;
and the word which ye hear is not mine, but our
Father’s, which sent me.
These things have I spoken unto you, being yet
present with you.
But the comforter, which is the holy ghost,
w
homour Father will send in my name, he shall
teachyou all things, and bring all things to your
rem
em
brance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
And if ye remember not, then the comforter
w
ill come to others that oome after you, and they
sh
all remember, and put all my words down in a
b
oo
k
, and the spirit of truth will sift the truth
from the untruth. And every man shall try all
th
in
gs, and hold fast unto that only which is
tru
th
.
Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto
you
; not as the world giveth, give I unto you.
Let not you* heart be troubled, neither let it be
afraid.
Ye have heard how I mid unto you, I go away,
and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would
rejoice, because I said, I go unto our Father; for
our Father is greater than I.
And now 1have told you before it come to pass,
that, when It is oome to pass, ye might believe,
Hereafter 1 will not talk much with you j for the
prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in
me.
But th a t the world may know that l love our
Father, and as our Father gave me commandment,
even so I do.
Then there was a deep silence, and Jesus list li­
ed for a while. And thereafter he continued:
I am the true vine, and our Father is the hus­
bandman.
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he
taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit,
he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.
Now ye are dean for a while through the won!
which I have spoken unto you.
Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cun
not bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine;
no more can ye, except ye abide in me.
1 am the vine, ye are the branches. He that
abideth in me, and I in him* the same bringeth
forth much fruit; for without me ye can do noth­
ing.
If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a
branch, and is withered; and men gather them*
and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you,
ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto
you. *,' ■
Herein is our Father glorified, that ye bear
much fruit; so shall ye be my disdples.
As our Father hath loved me, so have I loved
you; continue ye in my love.
If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in
my love; even as I have kept our Father’s com­
mandments, and abide in his love.
These things have I spoken unto you, that my
joy might remain in you, and that your joy might
be full.
This is my commandment, that ye love one an­
other, as I have loved you.
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man
lay down his life for his friends.
Ye are my friends, if ye do whatever 1 com­
mand you.
Henceforth I call you not servants; for the ser­
vant knoweth not what his lord doeth; but i
have called you friends, for all things that 1 haver
heard of our Father I have made known unto you.
Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,
and ordained you, that ye shall go and bring forth
fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that
whatsoever ye should ask of our Father in my*
name, he may give it you.
These things I command you, that ye love one
another.

But ye also *haJJ bear witneaa, because ye have

And Jesus continued his discourse, and he said
unto them
, When I sent you without purse, and
scrip, and shoes, lacked y e anything?
And they said, Nothing,
Then said he untothem
, But now, he that hath
a purse, let him take it, and likewise, his scrip,
and he that hath no sword, let him sell hi* gar­

For i say unto you, that this that is written
must be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned
among the transgressors. For the things concern­

And they said, Master, behold, here are two
swords.
And he said unto them One is enough.
And he continued:
These things have I spoken unto you, that ye
should not be offended.
They shall put you out of the temples; yea, the

And these thing* will they d

Then said some of the disciples among theta

A n d when they had sung a hymn, Jesus said,
Arise, let us go hence, and he went forth with his
disciples over the brook Cedron, into the mount of
Oliver, where w as a garden called Gethsemane,
intowhich he entered, and his disciples.
And Judas also, which delivered him, knew the
place; for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his
discipies, and he had told Judas to come hither to
himin the garden.
Then said Jesus unto them, All ye shall be of­
fended because of me this night; for it is w ritten,
1 will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the
flock shall be scattered abroad. ^
But after 1am risen again, I will go before you
Into Galilee.
Peter answered and said unto him, Though all
men shall be offended because of thee, yet will 1
never be offended.
And Jesus said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan
hath desired to have thee, that he m ay sift thee
as wheat. But I have prayed for thee, th a t thy
faith fail not. And when thou a rt converted,
strengthen thy brethren.
And he said unto him, Master* I am ready to go
with thee, both unto prison, and to death.
Jesussaid unto him, Verily I say untothee, that
this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny
me thrice.
But Peter spake the more vehemently, Though
I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee.
Likewise also all the disciples.
Then Jesus said unto the disciples, Pray that ye
enter not into temptation. Sit ye here, while I go
yonder and pray.
And he took with him Peter and the two sons
of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very
heavy.
Then said he unto them, My soul is exceeding
sorrowful, even unto death. Tarry ye here, and
watch with me.
And he went a little farther, and he was with­
drawn from them about a stone's cast, and fell on
his face, and prayed, saying, Abba, Father, all
things are possible unto thee. If it be possible, let
th is cup pass from me! Nevertheless, not as I will,
but as thou wilt.
And there appeared an angel unto him from
heaven, strengthening him.
And being in an agony, he prayed more earnest­
ly; and his sw eat was as it were great drops of
blood falling down to the ground.
And when he rose up from prayer, he came to
his disciples, and found them asleep, and said unto
Peter, W hat! could ye not watch w ith me one
hour?
Watch, and pray, th a t ye enter not into tem pta­
tion ; the spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh is
weak. • 1 f
^ And he went away again the second time, and
^ prayed, saying, O m y Father, if this cup may not
t — away from me, except 1 drink it, thy will be
done.
And he came and found them asleep ag ain ; for
their eyes were heavy, neither wist they v
,
answer him.
And he left them, and went away again, ,im
prayed the third time, saying the same words.
Then came he to his disciples, and said unto
them, Sleep onnow, and take your rest.
But after a little, he added sorrowfully, Behold,
the hour is at hand, and a son of m
an is delivered
into the hands of sinners.
Rise, let us be going. Behold, he is at hand that
doth deliver me.
And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the
twelve, came, and with him a band of men and
officers from Caiaphas, with lanterns and torches
and staves and swords.
And as soon as he was com
e, he went straight
to Jesus, and said, Master, Master; and kissed
him. vl|H
And Jesus said unto him, Judas, thou deliver-
est a son of man with a kiss..
But Judas understood not what Jesus said, for
he had done only that which the master had com­
manded him.
But Jesus knowing all things that should come
upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom
seek ye?
They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth.
Jesus said unto them, I am he.
As soon then as he had said unto them, I amhe,
they went backward, and fell on the ground.
Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye?
And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
Jesus answered, I have told you that 1amh
e
.
If therefore ye seek me, let these go their w
ay,
that the saying might be fulfilled which hesp
a
k
e
,
Of themwhich thou gavest me have I lost n

e
.
And they laid their hands on him
, and t
o
o
k

him, and bound him.
When they which were about him saw what
would happen, they said unto him
, M
aster, shall
we smite with the sword?
Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drewit,an
d
smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off his
right ear. The servant's name was M
alchus.
Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sw
o
rd
into the sheath, for all they that take the sw
o
rd
,
hhall perish with the sword. For this lesson
, to
ldi
thee that one sword is sufficient. Thinkest th

u
that I cannot now pray our Father, and hesh

gels? The cup which our Father hath givenm
e
,
shall I not drink it? But how then shall thescrip
­
tures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
And he touched his ear, and healed it.
Then said Jesus unto them , Are ye come out, as
against a thief, w ith swords and with staves to
take m e?
I was daily w ith you in the temple, teaching,
and ye took me n o t; but this is your hour, and the
power of darkness, th a t the scriptures may be
fulfilled. Thereore sent I Judas unto you.
Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled, and
they led Jesus away.

And after a while came unto him they that
stood by, and one of the servants of the high
priest being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off,
said to Peter, Did not I see thee in the garden
with him t Surely thou also art one of them; for
thou art a Galilean, and thy speech betrayeth thee.
Then began he to curse and to swear, saying,
1 know not the man of whom ye speak.
And immediately the cock crew; and Jesus
turned, and looked upon Peter, and Peter remem­
bered the word o f Jesus, which said unto him, Be­
fore the cock crow, thou shall deny me thrice. And
he went out and wept bitterly.
T R IA L BEFORE P ILA T E
Then the Herodians led Jesus from Caiaphas
into the hail of judgment, and it was early. And
the soldiers o f Herod guarded the way, that the
Jews might not run together.
But the two high priests o f Herod went not into
the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled, and
might not eat the passover.
Pilate then went out unto them, and said, W hat
accusation bring ye against this man ?
The Herodians answered and said unto him. I f
he were not a malefactor, we would not have de­
livered him unto thee.
And they accused him, saying, W e have a law,
and by our law he ought to die, because he made
himself a son o f God.
Now the Herodians knew that Jesus was not
guilty according to the law o f the Jews, and that
it was not lawful to try a man on the sabbath and
cn the feast. Therefore had they brought Jesus un­
to Pilate.
For it is not written in the law o f the Jews that
it is unlawful to make oneself a son o f God; but
rather is it the very law.
Therefore the Herodians knew that if they
should keep Jesus till after the feast, not only
could they not accuse him before the Jews, but the
Jews would come together and set him free.
Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and
judge him according to your law. For he knew that
for envy they had delivered him. For when he was
set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto
him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that
just man; for I have suffered many things this
night in a dream because of him.
The Herodians therefore said unto him, It is
not lawful for us to put any man to death; that
the saying o f Jesus m ight be fulfilled, which he
spake, signifying what death he should die. For
the Jews crucified no m an; but that did the Ro­
mans.
Pilate said unto them, W hat then shall I do with
Jesus, which is called a son o f God ?
They all said unto him, Let him be crucified.
And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he
done?
But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be
crucified.
When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing,
IMS that rather a tumult was made, he took water,
and washed his hands before the Herodians, say*
mg, I am innocent of the blood of this juj
son; see ye to it.
Then answered the Herodians, and
blood be on us, and on our children.
And they continued to accuse Jesus. And wher.
he was accused he said nothing.
•Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not
how many things they witness against thee?
And he answered him to never a word; inso­
much that the governor marvelled greatly.
And the Herodians seeing that Pilate was still
loth to condemn Jesus, cried in a loud voice, Be
also calleth himself king o f the Jews.
And Pilate entered into the judgment hall again,
and called Jesus, and asked him, Art thou king of
the Jews ? And he, answering, said unto him, Say*
est thou this thing o f thyself, or did others tell it
thee o f me?
Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Men of thine own
nation and the high priest have delivered thee un­
to me. W hat hast thou done?
Jesus answered, M y kingdom is not of this
world. I f m y kingdom were of this world, then
would m y servants fight, that I should not be de­
livered to the Herodians; but now is my kingdom
not from hence.
Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king
then?
Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king.
To this end was I born, and for this cause came
I into this world, that I should bear witness unto
the truth. Every one that is o f the truth heareth
my voice.
Pilate said unto him, What is truth?
And when he had said this, he went out again
unto the Herodians, and said unto them, I find in
him no fault at all. For Pilate loved not the Herod­
ians, and wished not to deliver them of their en­
emies among the Jews.
So he said, But ye have a custom, that I should
release unto you one at the passover. Will ye
therefore that I release unto you the king of the
Jews?
Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man,
but Barabbas.
For there was one named Barabbas, a notable
prisoner, which lay bound with them that had
made insurrection with him, who had shed blood
in the insurrection.
But the Herodians knew not that he was of the
followers of Jesus; but because his name was Bar-
abbas which meaneth, Son of God, they thought
they might deceive the Jews and declare that Pi­
late had released a son of God.
But Pilate willing to release Jesus, spake again
to them, Whom will ye that 1 release to you?
Barabbas or Jesus?
And the Herodians cried the more fierce, say­
ing, He stirreth up the people, teaching through'
out Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.
When Pilate head of Galilee, he asked whether
the man was a Galilean.
And as soon as he knew that he belonged uato

Then he questioned 1

And the two high u
vehemently accused hfi
Jew
s that were there J M
id Herod. . . . .
And Herod with his men of war set him at
nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him In a
gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
Andthe same day Pilate and Herod were made
friends together; for before they were at enmity
between themselves.
Now why did Pilate and Herod become friends?
Because they both were hypocrites and enemies of
theJews; and they both agreed to sacrifice Jesus
that Herod might remain tetrarch and Pilate gov­
ernor. For a Jewish messiah that became king
would expel both the Romans and the Herodians;
and they feared that the Jews would make Jesus
For this reason said Caiaphas to the Jews that
it was expedient that Jesus should die. If Jesus
became king, the Romans would lay siege to Jeru­
salem
, and Herod would be stripped of his author­
ity. Therefore Herod pretended a love for Rome by
condemningJesus, who was loved of the people.
And Pilate, when he had called together the two
highpriests of Herod and the Herodians, said unto
them
, Ye have brought this man unto me again, as
one that perverteth the people; and behold, I,
having examined him before you, have found no
fault in this man, touching those things whereof
ye accuse him.
No, nor yet Herod, for I sent you to him ; and, lo,
nothing worthy of death is done by him.
N
owPilate knew that the Jews loved Jesus, and
hedesired to avoid the responsibility of his death.
Therefore, being a hypocrite, he placed the blame
onthehigh priests alone. And he said, 1 will there­
fore chastise him, and release him.
For of necessity he must release one unto them
at the feast.
And they cried out ail at once, saying, Aw ay
with this man, and release unto us Barabbas.
And some of the common people which the Her-
odians had mustered together, cried also, Barab­
bas, Barabbas (which by interpretation is the
sam
e as, Son of God), when the two high
priests of Herod prompted them, for tjhe people
confused Barabbas with Jesus.
And the Jews which knew Jesua were not at the
trial, for he had been taken in secret; and the
Anointed king.
, Then Pilate, though he knew Jesus C
o h
*> guilt
less, and had the authority to set him free, took
Jesus, and scou> god him ; for Hlste hated all .i» ws.
And the soldiers of the governor led him away
into the hall, called Praelorium; and they celled
together the whole band.
And they stripped him, and they put on Mn, *
purple robe, and platted a crown of thorns, and
put it about his head, and a reed in his right hand,
and began to salute him, Hail, King of the J*»w»,
And they smote him on the head with a re
and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees,
worshipped him. 1
Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of
thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate said onto
them, Behold the man!
When the two high priests of Herod and the of­
ficers saw him, they cried out, Crucify him, cruci­
fy him. We have a law; and by our law he ought u>
die, because he made himself a sort of God.
Now the two high priests of Herod deceived
Pilate as to the law of the Jews, but when ho
heard again that saying, he was the more afraid,
and went again into the judgment hall, and said
unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him
no answer.
Then said Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not
unto me? Knowest thou not that 1 have power to
crucify thee, and have power to release thee?
Jesus Answered, Thou couldst have no power
at all against me, except it were given thee from
above; therefore he that delivered me unto thee
hath the greater sin.
Then said the Jh rodians, I f thou let this man
go, thou art not Caesar’s friend. Whoso maketh
himself a king, speaketh against Caesar.
When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he
brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judg­
ment seat, in a place that is called the pavement,
but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
And it was the preparation of the passover, and

ans, Behold your king I
But they cried out, Aw ay with him; away with
him, crucify him !
Pilate said unto them, Shall 1 crucify your king ?
The Herodians answered, We have no king but
Caesar.
Then Pilate released unto them him that for
sedition and bloodshed was cast into prison, whom
they hod desired, and gave command that Jesus be
crucified.
And the soldiers when they had mocked Jesus,
took off the purple robe from him, and pot his own
clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.

P i OF CVKENS REARS THE CROSS
Am I as they M K e out, they found a ixmii of
C^msA £uoou by cutuof out of the ooun-
tdjr* the Jfethar o f Afexandtr And Rufus. Him they
competed to boor the otvss After Jesus.
And there t'olhvsved him a company of Jews, and
I t women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
But Jesus turning unto them said, daughters of
Jerusalem, v w p not for me* but weep for your­
selves,, and for your children.
- behold* the days ore coming. in the which
they shah say. Blessed are the barren, and
the wombs that never bare, and the paps which
Lever gave suck.
Then they begin to say to the mountains,
f y on us: and to the hilts. Cover us.
For if ;nt*v do these things in a green tree,
what shag be done in the dry ?
And there were also two other, malefactors, led
with kin* to he put to death.
And when they were come unto a place called
Golgotha, that is to say, a place o f a skull, they
gave him wine to drink, mingled with myrrh, but
he received it not.
THE CRUCIFIXION
And it was the third hour. And they nailed him
to the cross, and the malefactors, one on the right
h&nu, and the other on the left.
And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And
he was numbered with the transgressors.
And Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross
over his head: and the writing was his accusation.
Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews. For it was
not lawful, not according to the law o f the Jews,
and not according to the law of the Romans, that
.n |«te should be crucified for making himself a
sen of God.
This tide then read many of the Jews; for the
place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the
city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek,
and Latin.
Then said the two high priests of Herod to
Pilate, Write not. The King of the Jews; but that
he said. 1 am the king of the Jews.
Pilate answered, What I have written I have
written.
Then said Jesus, Father, forgive than; for they
know not what they do.
Then the soldiers parted his garments, casting
lots what every man should take, that it might be
fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They
parted my garments among them, and upon my
vesture did they cast lots.
And they made four parts, to every soldier a
part; and also his coat. Now the coat was without
seam, woven from the top throughout.
They said therefore among themselves, L et us
not. rend i t but cast lots for i t whose it shall be.
These things therefore the soldiers did.
And sitting down they watched him there.
And the people stood beholding.
But the rulers derided him, saying. He saved
others; let him save himself, if he be a messiah,
the anointed o f God.
And the soldiers also mocked htm
him, and offering him vinegar, and ‘1
be the king o f the Jews, save thyself. 1
And the two high priests of Herod
wagging their heads and saying, Ah, £ £ h |
destroyest the temple, and buildest it in f|||
days, save thyself. I f thou be a son of God, dap [
down from the cross.
And the Herodians said. I f he be the king|
g
Israel, let him ndw come down from the ooo, ||
we will believe him.
He trusted in God: let him deliver him non,it
he will have him ; fo r he said, 1am a son of God
And one o f the malefactors which wore haegei
railed on him, saying, I f thou be the anointed,gni
thyself and us.
But the other answering, rebuked him, w a g
Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou ait in th
e
same condemnation T And we indeed justly; forn
receive the due reward o f our deeds, but this nu
hath done nothing amiss.
And he said unto Jesus, Master, remember m
e
when thou comest into thy kingdom.
And Jesus said unto him. Verity, I say tats
thee. Today shaft thou be with me in paradise.
Now there came to the cross of Jesus his m
etr.
er, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife d
Cleophas, and M ary Magdalene.
When Jesus therefore saw his mother, andth*
disciple standing by whom he loved, he said u
nto
his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
Then said he to the disciple, Behold thy mother!
And, from that hour that disciple took her onto
his own home.
Now from the sixth hour there was daring
over all the land unto the ninth hour, and thesan
was darkened.
And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a
loud voice, saying, Eloi^Eloi, lama, sahaehthamt
that is to say, M y God, my God, why hast tkm
forsaken me .
Some of them that stood there, when theyhair:
that, said, This man calleth for Elias.
And straightway one of them ran, and Sgj j
sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it o
n
a reed, and gave him to drink.
The rest said, Let be, let us see whether E
lias
will come to save him.
A fte r this, Jesus, knowing that all things v«n
now accomplished, that the scripture migh be ful­
filled, said, I th irst
Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: aw
they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it u
p
on
hyssop, and put it to his mouth.
When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar
he said, It is finished. Father, into thy band 1
commend my spirit!
And he cried with a loud voice, Shema Yisrm,
Yhwh Eloainu, Yhwh Echod! that is to say, K«ar
O Israel! Yhwh is our God, Yhwh is One.
And he bowed his head and gave up the gbe&

beholding the things which were done,
mote their breasts and returned.
And when afterwards all the Jews heard that
Jess* had tvv: i cnirijIfied, their anger against K -
hte was great. so thet they constrained Caesar to
nmlt ton, and Pilate went and killed him self and
w$ thrown into toe Tiber.

Now in the place where he was crucified there

I k f o l t e s u n .
And they said amoo( tkeiusdm Who shall roll
away the stone from the doorof the sepulchre?
And whoa they looked* they saw that the Itone
was rolled away; for it was very great*
v And entering into the sepulchre* they saw two
young men sitting on the right side, clothed in
long white garments; and they were affrighted

dhe said unto them, W hat manner o f com­
munications are these, that ye have one to anoth­
er, as ye walk, and are sad ?
And the one o f them, whose name was Cleopas,
answering said unto him, A rt thou only a stranger
inJerusalem, and hast not known the things
w
hichare come to pass there in these days ?
Andhe said unto them, W hat things?
And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of
Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed
and word before God and all the people.
And how the high priest and Herod delivered
himto be condemned to death, and have crucified
him.
But we trusted that it had been he which should
have redeemed Israel. A nd besides all this, today
is the third day since these things were done.
Yea, and certain women also of our company
made us astonished, which w ere early at the
sepulchre; and when they found not his body, they
came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of
angels, which said that he was alive.
And certain o f them which were with us went
to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the wo­
m
en had said; but him they found not.
Then he said unto them, 0 fools, and slow o f
heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.
Ought not a messiah to have suffered these
things, and to enter into his glory?
And beginning at Moses, and all the prophets,
he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the
thingsconcerning himself.
And they drew nigh unto the villa ge w hither
they went;and he made as though he would have
gonefurther.
But they constrained him, saying, A b id e w ith
us, for it is toward evening, and the day is fa r
spent.
And he went in to tarry with them.
And it came to pass, as he sat at m eat w ith
them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake,
andgave to them.
And their eyes were opened, and th ey knew
him;and he vanished out o f th eir sight.
And they said one to another, Did not our heart
bum within us, while he talked w ith us by the
way, and while he opened to us the scriptures ?
And they rose up the same hour, and returned
to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered to­
gether, and them that were w ith them, saying,
The master is risen indeed, and hath appeared to
Simon (not Peter).
And they told what things were done in the
way, and how he was known of them in breaking
bread. And they believed them not.
Now they were eleven, th erefore was Judas
Iscariot with them, for it is said, that Thom as was
notthere.
And Jesus had told Judas that he should rise
again, and Judas believing in his resurrection, had
done as he had been commanded.
But now, when all the apostles believed not that
Jesus was risen, Judas also began to doubt, and
his heart was filled with sorrow, and he went
away.
JUDAS RETURNS THE SILVER
Then Judas, which had delivered him, when he
saw what had befallen Jesus, was grieved unto
death, and brought again the thirty pieces of sli­
er, to the two high priests of Herod, saying, I have
sinned, in that I have delivered the innocent blood.
And they said, What is that to us? See thou to
that.
And he cast down the pieces of silver in the
temple, and departed, and went and hid himself.
And the two high priests of Herod took the sil­
ver pieces, and said, It is not lawful to put them in
the treasury, because it is the price of blood.
And they took counsel, and bought w ith them
the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.
Wherefore that field was called, the field of
blood, unto this day.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by
Jermy the prophet, saying, And they took the
thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that Was
valued, whom they of the children of Israel did not
value, and gave them for the potter’s field, as the
Lord appointed me.
And when Jesus was risen, he came and prayed
with Judas, and said, Because thou didst obey me
and do that I commanded thee, that the scripture
might be fulfilled, thy sin be forgiven thee that
thou didst go and hide thyself. For thou also shalt
sit on thy throne in paradise among the judges of
Israel.
APPEARS TO APOSTLES
But as they yet sat at meat Jesus himself stood
in the midst of them, and said unto them, Peace
be unto you.
But they were terrified and affrighted, and sup­
posed that they had seen a spirit.
And he upbraided them with their unbelief and
hardness of heart, because they believed not them
which had seen him after he was risen.
And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled?
And why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
' Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I my­
self. Handle me, and see. For a spirit hath not
flesh and bones, as ye see I have.
And when he had thus spoken, he shewed his
hands and his feet.
And while they yet believed not for joy, and
wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any
meat?
And they gave him a piece of broiled fish, and
of a honeycomb.
And he took it, and did eat before them.
And he said unto them, These are the words
which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you,
that all things must be fulfilled, which were writ­
ten in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and
in the psalms, concerning me.
Then opened he their understanding; that they
might understand the scriptures. And said unto
them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the
anointed to suffer, and to rise from the dead be»
lore the third day.
And that repentance and remission of sins
should be preached in his name among all nations,
beginning in Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of
these things.
And, behold, 1 will send the promise of our Fa­
ther upon you. But tarry you in the city o f Jeru­
salem. until ye be endued with power from on
high.
TH E LE V ITATIO N
And he led them out. as far as Bethlehem,
and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.
And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he
I was parted from them, and levitated up into heav­
en.
And they worshipped him, and returned to Jer­
usalem with great joy, and were continually in the
temple praising and blessing God.
DOUBTING THOMAS
But Thomas, one o f the twelve, called Didymus,
was not with them when Jesus came.
The other disciples therefore said unto him, W e
have seen the master. But he said unto them, Ex­
cept 1 shall see in his hands the print o f the nails,
and put my finger into the print o f the nails, and
thrust my hand into his side, 1 will not believe.
And after eight days, again his disciples were
within, and Thomas with them. Then came Jesus,
the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and
amd, Peace be unto you.
Then said he to Thomas, Beach hither thy fing­
er and behold my hands; and reach hither thy
hand, and thrust it into my side; and be not faith­
less, but believing.
And Thomas answered and said unto him, M y
1
<ri and my redeemer.
Jeauu said unto him, Thomas, because thou hast
v a, thou hast believed. Blessed are they that
iK ts not seen, and yet have believed.
I said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto
5Mm! As our Father hath sent me, even so send 1
presence of his disciples, which are not written§ « -:
.
this book; but these are written, that F M am H
believe that Jesus is the anointed, a son of <jfcp||
and that believing, ye might have life through|j^
name.
DISCIPLES GO TO GALILEE
Then the eleven disciples went away into G
d|v
lee, into a mountain where Jesus had sppatatat
them.
And when they saw him, they worshipped
but some doubted.
And Jesus came and spake unto them, g&yisg,
All power is given unto me in heaven and earth.
Go ye therefore, and teach ail nations, baptioag
them in the name of our Father, and of the spirit
of truth, and in my name; teaching than to «t
serve all things whatsoever I have com
m
anded
you. And, lo, I am with you alway, even untotht
end of the world.
And the disciples answered saying, This age rf
unrighteousness and unbelief is under the pomf v
of Satan which doth not permit things which am
made impure by the evil spirits to comprHhiijt
the truth of God and his power. For this reams
reveal thy righteousness now.
And Jesus replied to them, The limit of the
years of the power of Satan hath been h ilfim
but other terrible things are near at hand; andi
was delivered unto death on behalf of thosevh#
sinned in order that they may return to the truth
and sin no more, to the end that their souls m
ay
inherit the spiritual and incorruptible glory «£
righteousness which is not here but inheaven.B
a
&
go ye unto all the world and preach the gospel
But go ye not yourselves, but they thatye send.
And tarry ye here as I have already told you.
And they went forth and preached everyvhm$
the master working with them, and confirm®^
the word with signs following.
And they ordained disciples, and sent themh
ritp
.
all the world.
JESUS APPEAR S AGAIN

A fte r these things Jesus shewed himself apes
to the disciples at the sea o f Tiberias; and ontttfc

There were together Simon Peter, and Tbepss
called Didymus, and Nathanael o f Cana in ftstifat:
and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of hisdb-

Simon Peter said unto them, I go a fishsav

and that nig$it they caught nothing.
But when the morning was now come, ,M*»

Then Jesus said unto them, Children, have
any meat? They answered him. No.
And he laid unto them, Cast the net un tH

therefore, and now they were not able to draw a

Therefore tnat disciple whom Jesus loved|M

S * heard that it was the master, he girt his
Zher’s coat unto him (for he was naked); and
casthimself into the sea.
Andtheother disciples came in a little ship (for
theywere not far from land, but as it were two

As soon then as they were come to land, they

Jesu

yehavenow caught.
Sim

todfor all these were so many, yet was not the
netbroken.
Jesu
ssaid unto than, Come and dine. And none
ofthedisciples durst ask him, Who art thou?
knowingthatit was the master
Jesusthencame and took bread, and gave them;

This was now many times that Jesus shewed

self to his disciples, after that he was risen
fromthe dead.
Sowhen they had dined, Jesus said to Simon
Jesns, and he thought that jeans ft£Q doubted
that he loved him. So Peter, seeing the other, aakt

Then went this saying abroad among the breth­

For, can the leopard change his spots? Nay,

But, in the latter days, they that pay taxes

JESUS’ DEATH
And as Jesus stood on the walls of the city cry*
ing aloud, a stone slung by the Romans struck him
down, and.his spirit passed to heaven, as it is
written in Josephus:
But what is still more terrible, there was one
Jesus, the son of Ananus, a plebian and an hus­
bandman, who four years before the war began,
and at a fim e when all was in very great peace and
prosperity, came to that feast whereon it is otir
custom for every one to make tabernacles to God
in the temple, and began on a sudden to cry aloud,
‘A voice from the east, a voice from the west, a
voice from the four winds, a voice against Jeru­
salem and the holy house, a voice against the
bridegrooms and the brides, and a voice against
this whole people.’ This was his cry, as he went
about by day and night, in all the lanes of the city.
However, certain o f the most eminent among the
populace had great indignation at this dire cry
o f his, and took up the man, and gave him a great
number of stripes; yet did he not say anything
for himself, but still went on with the same words,
which he cried before. Hereupon our rulers, sup­
posing, as the case proved to be, that this was a
sort of divine fury in the man, brought him to
the Roman procurator, where he was whipped till
the bones were laid bare, yet he did not make any
supplication fo r himself, nor shed any tears, but
turning his voice to the most lamentable tone pos­
sible, at every stroke o f the whip his answer was,
‘Woe, woe to Jerusalem!’ And when Albinus (for
he was then our procurator) asked him, Who he
was? and whence he came? and why he uttered
such words ? he made no manner of,reply to what
he said, but still did not leave o ff his melancholy
refrain, till Albinus took him to be a madman,
and dismissed him. Now, during all the time that
passed before the war began, this man did not go
near any o f the citizens, nor was he seen by them
except while he said these things; but every day
he uttered these lamentable words, as if it were
his premeditated vow, ‘Woe, woe to JerusalemT
N or did he give ill words to any of those that beat
him every day, nor good words to those that gave
him food; but this was his reply to all men, and
indeed no other than a melancholy presage to
come. This cry o f his was the loudest at the fes­
tivals; and he continued this refrain for seven
years and five months, without growing hoarse,
or being tired therewith, until the very time that
he saw his presage in earnest fulfilled in our
siege, when it ceased; for as he was going round
the wall, he cried out with his utmost, ‘Woe, woe
to the city again, and to the people, and to the
holy house!’ and just as he added at the last, ‘Woe,
woe to myself also § there came a stone out of one
of the engines, and smote him, and killed him im­
mediately; ami as he was uttering the very
same presage he gave up the ghost.

THfi END
I
In this Gospel according to lm-anu-el, I have
fcept as dose to the versions accepted by the
churches as I could, so as not to cause too much
confusion. However, I must state that the original
Aramaic in possession of my family proved in­
disputably that the accepted versions are replete
with error and corruption. Those who are not
afraid of criticism, I refer to such books as Lam-
sa’s ‘Gospels According to the Eastern Version,'
translated from an Aramaic version, in which he
draws attention to over 1400 errors in the accept­
ed versions.
While I have nothing but praise for Lamsa's
version, I must state that it is as corrupt as the
Greek versions. For instance, Lamsa trans­
lates Matthew 19:24 as follows: "Again I say to
you, It is easier for a rope to go through the eye
o f 1needle, than for a rich man to enter the king­
d o m o f God/” The King James version is nearer
the original saying which was: " . . <- camel to
go through the eye of the needle. . • 1
In David Street, Jerusalem, ail Iron ha*1 p|r
vents camels from approaching the Tempi** A* **»
This is called the Needle's Eye. The authors of fn#
Aramaic version used by l/untsa, not knowing this
fact, changed the word camel to rope, 'rimy
thought thus to make the words of Jesus ttw fto
rational. They only succeeded in disclosing in#
hierarchical hand that corrupted their Aramaic
version.
The mistranslations o f the I m U u VulgaG* Hilda
are strikingly exemplified In the horns of Minimi'
angelo's famous statue of Moses. The Vulgat#
reads "A nd Moses knew not that hts face w ee
homed,” -—Exodus ?A :29, instead of "A n d Mo***s
knew not that his face shone,” because the t.rana
lators ignorantly or maliciously confused I He­
