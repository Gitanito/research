THE PAST AND IMMEDIATE PRESENT
Throughout uncounted centuries, morally and Spiritually-
minded men were concerned especially with one ALL-IM-
portant edict as it concerned their destiny. This is simply
stated:
"Fear not those who are able to destroy your body,
but those who can destroy body and Soul."1
The emphasis is placed on the Soul of man, THAT BEING
the ONLY reality, the mental and physical being temporal.
This Divine edict has necessitated restatement as the re-
sult of the machinations of an almost unbelievably vicious
minority of human creatures, to:
Fear those who by usurped power have the means to
destroy man's manhood, thereby making him incapable
of thinking, reasoning and bereft of the power of imagi-
nation; no longer a human creature, but a robot or zombie,
prevented from fulfilling his Divine destiny by making it
impossible to awaken the Soul.
The methods employed for this purpose are now admitted-
ly being pursued in America; the real American people gener-
ally being the victims. The procedures are the most vicious and
diabolical the human mind could conceive.2 The express intent,
therefore, of this text is to expose these methods, that those who
will, may protect themselves and their families by sane, Divinely
indicated means at the command of all men and women.
^his treatise is prepared especially for those who still
believe in the existence of Cod, a Divine Law, and that man is
possessed of a Soul.
2 When the first edition of this book was written nearly all
the vicious and inhuman methods were the invention of non-
Americans. Many new procedures have been added which are
the result of the debased minds of Americans.

PREFACE
"The books that help you most are those
that make you think."—Theodore Parker
We heartily agree with this, but enlarge upon it: The
MISSION OF A BOOK IS TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK,
REASON, ANALYZE, AND ACT ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN
CONCLUSIONS.
The present text has all this in mind and in addition, to
offer information, which if followed, will be of infinite benefit,
especially to Americans, and to humanity as a whole, as well as to
expose HORRORS ALMOST BEYOND DESCRIPTION, AND WHOLLY
INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO THE AVERAGE SANE MIND. These
diabolical methods have already been successfully practiced in
many countries. By the frank admission of their advocates, they
are general in America, and are to become universal.
The direct impetuses for the present volume are several:
First, the frank statements contained in Bertrand Russell's book
The Impact of Science on Society, 1953 edition, describ-
ing what Fichte foresaw would be the common lot of humanity.
Russell is an author accepted by the Intelligensia every-
where, because the Nobel prize has been conferred upon
him, and he has held positions in some of the most popular
universities.
The second reason is the ever-increasing number of re-
quests we have received from every section of the country to
continue our efforts, and render an unbiased opinion, based on
the research of the past several years.

such births are desirable from the racial point of view.
"The best way to put eugenics into practice is to make it
compulsory for all male children to be sterilized soon after
birth. . . . Certain male children to be selected strains will
be exempt from compulsory sterilization. These children
will be carefully selected by a thorough scientific study of
their pedigree.

So great has become the momentum of treason to the
American people, that even many of those in the highest posi-

taking the oath of their office, should be the intermediary be-
tween the citizens and God in dispensing justice, have flag-
rantly betrayed their trust, actually turning over the citizenry
to the enemy.
Our hope is that this book will be found to be basically
different from all others because of our refusal to follow the
usual defamation route, and that the reader will recognize that
we have given those who have confidence in us, sufficient in-
formation to enable them to act as reasonable human beings
and, above all, God fearing Americans.
We have added a number of Chapters not included in the
Fichte and Russell concepts. These are on almost purely Amer-
ican devised methods for the degeneration, demoralization and
subjugation of the masses by means of methods they will more
readily accept than the European procedures. Among them are
the "happy pill" and other drugs, the "snake pit" horrors, the
"Civil Rights" Legislation, the plans for an Alaskan "institu-
tion" and desegregation as a means to mongrelization, and
the decadence of all races accepting this idea, and falling
victims to it.
Since the publication of the first edition of The Age of
Treason, much has happened. A great amount of diabolism
has been revealed, the betrayals of the race are so many, the
adulteration of food and water so universal, that it has become
necessary to divide the contents of the book into two parts; one
devoted entirely to food and water, and how to avoid the pit-
falls toward mental degeneracy. This refers to the book Your

subjugation of the masses by means of methods they will more
readily accept than the European procedures. Among them are
the "happy pill" and other drugs, the "snake pit" horrors, the
"Civil Rights" Legislation, the plans for an Alaskan "institu-
tion" and desegregation as a means to mongrelization, and
the decadence of all races accepting this idea, and falling
victims to it.
Since the publication of the first edition of THE AGE OF
TREASON, much has happened. A great amount of diabolism
has been revealed, the betrayals of the race are so many, the
adulteration of food and water so universal, that it has become
necessary to divide the coments of the book into two parts; one
devoted emirely to food and water, and how to avoid the pit-
falls toward mental degeneracy. This refers to the book YOUR
HEALTH AND SANITY. The presem volume outlines the other

diabolical means and methods have the identical ends in view.
Finally, who is at fault? Who is responsible for these
hideous and inhuman practices with worse to follow?
How is it possible that among an intelligent and civilized
people the practice of a single one of these vicious practices has
become possible? Let us face the facts. It is because we as citi-

Imagine yourself becoming CONSCIOUS you are grad-
ually losing your manhood—that your mind is rapidly deterior-
ating so that you are no longer able to think clearly; unable to
plan your future actions; that your resistance is becoming so
weak you are no longer master of actions. In short, that you are
rapidly developing into a moron, a robot, a zombie, readily sub-
ject to the dictates of others.
Imagine further that your beloved children's mental de-

normal. That in every respect there is apparent a retrograding
influence, away from the highly evolved human toward that of
the moron.

"An INS Washington dispatch dated June 22, 1955,
said that two scientists testifying before a House Com-
merce sub-committee urged the withholding of Salk vac-
cine inoculations till 'a safe vaccine' should be produced;
and two other scientists 'raised the possibility that his
(Dr. Salk's) vaccine might damage kidneys on some
inoculated persons'."
Due to the prominence of Dr. Russell's book, The Im-
pact of Science on Society, these ideas received much at-
tention and discussion among those in America with advanced
formal education, and naturally the statement of these scien-
tists instilled a fear in the minds of millions of what might
possibly be done to the minds of the human race vide inocula-
tions; especially to children, considering the millions to be
inoculated.
This fear was in no wise lessened when the people (the
mass) read articles in various newspapers and magazines and
a multiplicity of booklets similar to the one quoted, relative to
these subjects. These fears are due principally to two specific
reasons with which those who are opposed to inoculations have
little to do:
1. Constant propaganda.
2. What accepted scientists and the enemies of mankind
boldly say can be done to children's mentality, by means of
inoculations with serums which in themselves are possibly in-
nocent, but which have been tampered with, and prepared
according to formula of the enemies of mankind.
Few recognize that propaganda is a form of advertising;
that in effect, it is really a subtle type of "brain-washing,"
repeatedly making impressions on the mind of a person, until
he accepts it as true. This is a highly satisfactory means for con-

jection and emotional conditioning, or adjustment to the
idea, there is, after a certain time, or certain stage is
reached, a KEaction, and that which was accepted as an
absolute truth, is changed into a revulsion, an absolute loss
of confidence, and replaced by fear. Religious conversion
from one faith to another can be cited as an example.
That advertising, as well as propaganda, is a form of
brainwashing is readily demonstrated and easily understood.
Take an everyday occurrence as example: my lady's use of a
detergent. She has found her regular product altogether satis-
factory. She wants no other.
Now there is a new discovery advertised day after day on
the radio or television. At first she sees and hears, but does not
pay much attention to it. Shortly it begins to attract her atten-
tion. Then she begins to wonder if it is really better than what
she has been using and doubt replaces confidence. She concludes
it might be well to try it. She is "sold."
Shakespeare even in his time was aware of this Law of
mental reaction, and in substance, stated so in a few words:
"Me thinks she protests TOO much."
If a person is innocent, to deny may restore confidence, but
to repeatedly deny, has the opposite effect; it arouses doubt and
suspicion.
The American newspapers, believing they, by their meth-
ods, were serving a great cause, time and again urged parents
to have their children immunized against polio, were forced to
frankly admit that they failed to arouse the parents to action.
They did their duty as they saw it, but failed to recognize the
fact that their insistence of what should be done was actually
a reverse "brain-washing." They had at first succeeded in what
they tried to do, then undid it by their continued efforts, bring-
ing about mental REaction; arousing fear in place of confidence.

AGE OF TREASON
The grave problem which continually confronts the public
is not: Will inoculation prevent polio? "Is it possible," as
Fitche, vie Russell and the enemies of mankind claim, "to so
prepare the serum with an agent potent enough to stultify the
minis of children, making them morons, or near imbeciles?"
Who can tell, or be trusted to tell, whether or not, and
when, such elements might be incorporated in the serum —
any serum — to be used, and finally: Would YOU have your
children inoculated with it? Fear once instilled, is difficult to
eradicate, and it has been instilled thoroughly and
COMPLETELY IN THE MINDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
While it is unquestionably true that the greater part of the
American newspapers have been encouraging parents to have
their children inoculated, it cannot be denied that many news-
papers have, from time to time, reported undesirable effects
and even deaths, as a result of the inoculations. Whether or not
such deaths were actually the result of the serum, or induced by
other causes, it is impossible to say, but it is certain that such
reports were not only local, but widely circulated, and have
greatly added to the fear of serum therapy.
If these reports are added to what has been said, written
and published, on the deterioration of man's mind by various
means, especially by serums, man's fears are readily under-
standable. These reports of harmful results, or deaths, have been
republished in leaflets, magazines and books, and are so widely
circulated that there is today hardly a person who has not some
knowledge of actual, or reported ill-effects.
The enemies of God and mankind, by their own admission,
have used, or plan to employ, inoculations for the purpose of
destroying mental balance, making it impossible for the
minds of children to develop beyond a more or less moronic or
robotic degree, and this has instilled fear into the minds of many
parents.

sicians a fear, that the methods followed in introducing the Salk
vaccine were merely the opening wedge to State or Socialized
medicine. The American Medical Association has been espe-
cially sensitive to this after purportedly spending millions in
educating their members and the people against any form of
socialized medicine.
One physician, Gordon B. Lettch, M. Sc., M.D., in an
article entitled A Step Toward Socialized Medicine, pub-
lished in the magazine Natural Food and Farming, Vol-
ume 2, No. 10, January, 1956, and circulated among many of
America's health conscious people, questioned the merits of the
serum, and equally so the method pursued in propagandizing it:
"Does the Salk vaccine program constitute a brain-
wash to condition Americans for the docile acceptance of
regimented medicine?
"Many physicians, thoughtful and disturbed by the
anti-polio vaccine imbroglio, think that it does.
"Let it be stated now, since the Salk vaccine resulted
from patronage of the National Foundation for Infantile
Paralysis, that no attack on the Foundation is intended2.
The tremendous services performed in aiding research,

vaccine were merely the opening wedge to State or Socialized
medicine. The American Medical Association has been espe-
cially sensitive to this after purportedly spending millions in
educating their members and the people against any form of
socialized medicine.
One physician, Gordon B. Lettch, M. Sc., M.D., in an
article entitled A STEP TOWARD SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, pub-
lished in the magazine NATURAL FOOD AND FARMING, Vol-
ume 2, No. 10, January, 1956, and circulated among many of
America's health conscious people, questioned the merits of the
serum, and equally so the method pursued in propagandizing it:
"Does the Salk vaccine program constitute a brain-
wash to condition Americans for the docile acceptance of
regimented medicine?
"Many physicians, thoughtful and disturbed by the
anti-polio vaccine imbroglio, think that it does.
"Let it be stated now, since the Salk vaccine resulted
from patronage of the National Foundation for Infantile
Paralysis, that no attack on the Foundation is intended:?,

commit this sin against god and the soul. To this in-
grained belief has now been added a wholesome fear,
that in some serum will be implanted a substance
to degenerate human reason, and make of man
a robot, a human monstrosity.
The question many ask is:
"Can any Legislature enact Laws that will interfere
with man's natural and religious convictions, and force
men and their families to be inoculated against their will?
If this is done, can this be harmonized with the Consti-
tutional guarantee of personal liberty, for which they left
their Fatherland, as well as with the strong antagonism
of many physicians against mass medication?"
Two very important facts must be faced, facts which may
be suppressed for a time, but which will be certain to flare up

other countries that they might be free from religious inter-
ference, were almost all disciples of Father Kneipp and his
Nature cure, and their faith in these methods of procedure, is,
in many instances, still stronger than in any medical practice.
Inoculation to them is "blood pollution."
Any such compulsory acts would place many physicians
in a most serious dilemma. By his physician's oath the physi-

the most important factor in saving a patient's life. On the other
hand, he is also bound to obey civil law. His patient may be one
of the most respected and influential citizens in the community,
and to act in opposition to his will, may mean ostracism among
his friends. What is he going to do about it? History is
replete with instances where a people forced to do that which
brings self-condemnation of their conscience upon
THEM, causes them to build up a fury against those they feel
are their oppressors, which nothing other than the oppressor's
downfall can finally calm. What will the answer be?
Dr. David B. Allman, of Atlantic City, when elected
President of the American Medical Association, is reported to
have told several hundred medical students of Jefferson Medical
College that:
"Doctors must have convictions concerning a great power,
and must have religious faith beyond the science of medi-
cine." — Emphasis ours.
This is the Soul's revealment of the true physician; of the
American spirit at its best; of the humanitarian whose Soul is
in his profession. The question is: How will the physician react
when called upon to impose upon a patient any form of treat-
ment, or procedure, which is against the patient's religious con-
viction, and by the acceptance of which he will feel con-
demned by God? How can the physician justify his physician's
oath, and obey compulsory civil laws?
Again speaking to physicians and future practitioners, Dr.
Allman is reported as saying:

and faith in their religion, and in the physician7
is frequently
the most important factor in saving a patient's life. On the other
hand, he is also bound to obey civil law. His patient may be one
of the most respected and influential citizens in the community,
and to act in opposition to his will, may mean ostracism among
his friends. WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? History is
replete with instances where a people forced to do that which
brings SELF-CONDEMNATION OF THEIR CONSCIENCE UPON
THEM, causes them to huild up a fury against those they feel
are their oppressors, which nothing other than the oppressor's
downfall can finally calm. What will the answer be?
Dr. David B. Allman, of Atlantic City, when elected
President of the American Medical Association, is reported to
have told several hundred medical students of Jefferson Medical
College that:
"Doctors must have convictions concerning a great power,
and must have religious faith beyond the science of medi-
cine." - Emphasis ours.
This is the Soul's revealment of the true physician; of the
American spirit at its best; of the humanitarian whose Soul is
in his profession. The question is: How will the physician react
when called upon to impose upon a patient any form of treat-
ment, or procedure, which is against the patient's religious con-
viction, and by the acceptance of which he will feel con-
demned by God? How can the physician justify his physician's
oath, and obey compulsory civil laws?
Again speaking to physicians and future practitioners, Dr.
Allman is reported as saying:
"Physicians feel as close to this great Power as anyone can
7 Physicians of great reputation freely recognize that reo
ligious convictions and faith are mighty forces in the curing of
the ill.

What a pity, aye, what a crime, that men possessed of such
convictions as Dr. Allman's, are not placed in charge of our
great hospitals, homes for the aged and crippled, and insane
asylums. It is certain that if they were, "snake pits" and dia-
bolical operations, would soon be a thing of an unbelievable
past.
DO SCHOOL BOARDS NOW POSSESS THE
AUTHORITY CONFERRED UPON
LEGISLATORS?
As already noted, in 1957, the solons of the State of
Pennsylvania made every effort to pass a Law making Polio
inoculation of children attending school, mandatory. It failed
ingloriously.
In the present year, of 1959, two bills, one in the House of
Representatives, one in the Senate have been presented. These
bills are most cleverly written, combining Polio immunization
with accepted smallpox vaccination.
Why all this effort to legislate for such enactments when
there is a most simple and easy way to achieve the same ends?

The question is: Do edicts by groups of men supersede

POSTSCRIPT:
Latest reports indicate that there is a great deal of opposi-
tion to the enactment of laws making polio "shots" compulsory
in the State of Pennsylvania. It also appears, according to pub-
lished reports ("Philadelphia Inquirer" April 6, 1959) that to
their eternal credit, physicians of the State in general are not in
favor of such a mandatory law. And why not? Perhaps in their
wisdom gained by experience, they recognize that this would be
just another step in the effort to destroy all personal liberty,
and, also toward socialized medicine.
Beginning with the Salk vaccine, a greater change, not
to the benefit of the physician, took place. Prior thereto, any
discovery in medicine, was tested out by the physician and if
approved, pharmaceutical houses produced it. With the Salk
vaccine it was much different. It was from Salk to the pharma-
ceutical houses, experimental procedures, Government approval.
For the first time in medical history the physician had little or
nothing to do with it except to accept and use it.
Now another step has been taken toward controls. This is
the "newly developed" four-in-one vaccine, claimed to pro-
tect against polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus. An
official public health service said that the Government (not by
the physicians' approval of it) has licensed two pharmaceutical
firms to make the vaccine—The Arizona Republic, Phoenix,
March 26, 1959.

There were numerous causes for the non-acceptance of
polio vaccination by the people. One of them is due to the
manner—considered by many reputable physicians as UNethical
—in which the Salk vaccine was introduced to the public—
almost shoved down their throats—by the Government and
Pharmaceutical houses—instead of by the physicians, as for
instance, Insulin for Diabetes, or Penicillin for infections. This
was also considered a slap at their intelligence as physicians;
and, secondly, because many physicians, if they did not outright
condemn both the product and the procedure, were lukewarm
to it.

cals," but by recognized physicians of experience and unques-
tionable professional standing. We repeat again that our con-
cern is not so much with the serum or vaccine used with the idea
of combatting the flu, but the purpose for which it might be
used, as indicated by Fitche and Russell: The deterioration of
men's minds, ending in morons or insanity.

"Dr. Rantz said: 'If we were to give the vaccine to
1,000,000 persons across the board right now, we would
have more deaths and illnesses from the vaccine than we
have with the flu'."2
"Dr. Donald M. Campbell, president of the Medical
Society, commenting on the clamor for vaccine, said: 'I'd
say there is a good deal of hysteria or near-hysteria . . .
I'm giving the vaccine only to relieve the near-hysteria'."3
"What induced this near-hysteria? Dr. Meyer sug-
gested it arose from a deliberate campaign to sell the
vaccine."3
2 It is extremely doubtful if one of the laity would care to
make such a statement. It is certain that no one having in mind
the return to sane medical practice would want to do so. It is
equally certain, that the millions who do not believe in serum or
vaccine therapy, are fortified in their beliefs when they read
such statements made by physicians themselves; especially when
appearing more and more frequently in the press. Moreover, it
should give pause to those who are agitating for compulsory
inoculation laws for polio, or other diseases.
3 These statements have appeared in many newspapers,
millions have read them, and their faith in vaccines and serums
have been shattered. We repeat: It is certain that no responsible
person other than reputable physicians would dare risk libel
suits to make them.

"The bill provides blanket authorization for health

of the local police in taking prospective patients into cus-

a health or welfare worker may enter a home which here-
tofore American citizens have considered their castle, seize
an individual on mere hearsay evidence (Section 104 (b)

put away an enemy—and otherwise assume the powers

"1. A provision prohibiting the transfer of a resident
of one of the 48 states to a mental institution in
Alaska.
"2. A provision that all patients and proposed pa-
tients should be treated humanely; and

"3- A provision restating the patient's right to the
writ of habeas corpus.
"But [according to reports] the committee members
decided that even these 'commitment procedures' should
not be written by the Federal Government; that, instead,
the entire bill of procedures was properly a matter for the
people of Alaska and their legislature to decide—and the
Goldwater bill was substituted.
"In any case, the Alaska legislature would not have
the authority to reach into a state and take a citizen of that
state; and the Constitution of the United States guarantees
the right of habeas corpus—though that right certainly
ought to be spelled out in any bill for commitment pro-
cedures.
"The acute awareness of the importance of local self-
government, as against Federal interference, is perhaps the
most revealing evidence of the completeness of the victory
of the alarmed citizens who poured protests into Wash-
ington. It is extremely gratifying to some of us who have
tried for so many years to make the law makers see our
point of view, that we want to preserve local self-govern-
ment and resent the growing disregard of our individual
freedom by an increasingly overbearing Federal power
machine.
"Senator Langer offered, and the Senate accepted, an
amendment 'which carefully spelled out a prohibition
against taking any of these (Naval oil reserve) lands or
any other known mineral deposits' in the million-acre land
grant, I am informed by our Congressman, James Ott.
"The House accepted the Senate stripped-down ver-
sion of the bill, though its backers in the House, notably
Representative O'Brien of New York, wailed that the
superpatriots had ruined a good bill."

Mental Health Legislation, Marxist Concepts.
The Difficult and Complicated Problem of
Present-Day Mental Health Laws
Due to various causes, some readily controllable by just
and enforceable Laws, mental ill-health is increasing and will
continue to increase until all Toxic agents in fooa and water
potent to shatter the nervous system and weaken the mind, are
eliminated by means of strict legislation.
Laws dealing with this subject should have in view several
objectives:
1. The humane treatment of all who are mentally ill.
2. The strict prohibition under heavy penalties of any and
all experimentation or abuse of the mentally ill.
3. The supervision of all mentally ill by the selection of a
physician and psychiatrist, who, in conjunction, diagnose
all cases before treatment and/or confinement is
ordered.
4. The welfare of the mentally ill must be the first consid-
eration.
The problem confronting those sincerely interested in the
welfare of the unfortunate victims of mental illnesses from any
causes, is complicated by the undeniable fact—admitted by the
group itself—of a vicious minority fast becoming a majority.

by their own statements? We feel they can, and with ease.
In England there is a World Federation for Mental Health.
In the November, 1957 issue of Task Force, there appeared a
reprint prepared by Derek Tozer, of an article entitled "At-
tacks Through 'Mental Health'," by special permission,
from Candor, a British News Letter, London, England, from
which we quote in substance:
"The World Federation of Mental Health is Dr.

vividly portrays the character of the Federation, states:
'Principles of mental health cannot be successfully fur-

that you are no longer mentally balanced, and to permit you
to be at large is a danger to your family, community, and pos-
sibly the State.
27 This is an acknowledgment of what has been said before.
It unconditionally connects Mental Health activities with World
Citizenship. Not National, not American citizenship, but be-
trayal of loyalty to the country; in short, becoming a traitor, and
accepting dominion in every department of one's life. To stand
firmly for one's country, to refuse world citizenship, is per se
proof of nonconformity, hence a grave mental illness; a fit sub-
ject for a mental institution.

Sideline on Mental Health and Psychiatry
a Danger Signal — An Example
The constantly increasing danger to the average Ameri-
can who will not readily conform to a stereotyped pattern, and
who dares to criticize those in official positions, even though
the criticism is just, is illustrated by an occurrence which took
place in Germany. This condition was made the subject of a
broadcast by Fulton Lewis, and published in many newspapers,
specifically The Daily Oklahoman, February 6, 1958,
under the heading of:
"Criticism Brings Nightmare Ordeal"
Similar instances have occurred in various parts of the
United States. We have by-passed them because we felt that they
were sporadic outbursts, and not instances setting an example,
as a warning to every American citizen, who dares to have an
opinion of his own.
"The ordeal of Fletcher Bartholomew, meteorologist
for the Free Europe balloon propaganda operation out of
Munich, suggests that the psychiatric profession perform
a searching re-examination of its practices before it falls
into disrepute.1
1 Such an awakening appears to have taken place in various
states of the country, notably in California as indicated by the
discontinuation of the Kaizer Clinic (Chapter Two, Section
Five) and the Bill by Senator Dilworth (Chapter Two, Section
Seven) in the California Legislature.

Kaiser Clinic in Oakland, California, where psychiatrists and

social workers are a greater danger to man's freedom in Amer-

widespread, would be the source of great harm because honest,

Mental Health Legislation — An Awakening
Mental Health Legislation within the past few years has
been proceeding at a galloping rate. Much of this legislation is
based on the Marxist ideas as annunciated by Lenin and his
followers. If analyzed, basing the conclusions on THE PROPO-
NENTS OWN STATEMENTS, it classifies as insane or on the bor-
der line, the actually sane, self-supporting, personally respon-
sible, individualistic personalities who made this country what it
is, its people supporting most of the world's drones and deca-
dents. The Reason: They are men and will not con-
form, while the really borderline and actually insane, though
perhaps not consciously so, set themselves up to judge, condemn,
confine the perfectly sane, frequently confiscating the property
of the really normal.
So all inclusive has become the condemnatory powers of
this group, which is thoroughly imbued with foreign ideologies,
that it has aroused the public to this peril, while judges on the
bench recognize the great danger and in some instances no
longer consider themselves bound to carry out the edicts of
such legislation.
Indiana is such a state. Apparently the first state where,
as a result of the action of associated Judges, it sets at variance
its Laws dealing with this terribly dangerous procedure.

"The temporary section is one of three new or re-
vised sections added to the mental health code last year—
by the Indiana General Assembly.9
"The first section allows a person to surrender vol-
untarily for treatment and the third section provides for
emergency commitment where the person is violent or
threatens injury.10
"I believe until further notice I am not going to
bother about temporary commitments,' Judge Niblack
wrote. 'Under regular commitment procedures, now fol-
lowed by the superior and circuit courts, a citizen signs the
affidavit and a physician attests to it.
"Then a notice is delivered personally to the accused
and he appears in court with his attorney.
"After hearing the testimony, the court appoints two
'disinterested' phychiatrists to conduct an examination and
submit a report of their findings.
They are in need of efficient, careful, humane treatment, not
incarceration in an asylum.
Who is the physician who does not have epileptic males as
his patients, and who does not know of others similarly afflicted,
who are fathers of healthy children and who themselves are
respected, responsible, and creative citizens.
9 That it was possible to add these additional sections as-

"The temporary section is one of three new or re-
vised sections added to the mental health code last year-
by the Indiana General Assembly.!I
"The first section allows a person to surrender vol-
untarily for treatment and the third section provides for
emergency commitment where the person is violent or
threatens injury.10
"I believe until further notice I am not going to
bother about temporary commitments,' Judge Niblack
wrote. 'Under regular commitment procedures, now fol-
lowed by the superior and circuit courts, a citizen signs the
affidavit and a physician attests to it.
"Then a notice is delivered personally to the accused
and he appears in court with his attorney.
"After hearing the testimony, the court appoints two
'disinterested' phychiatrists to conduct an examination and
submit a report of their findings.
They are in need of efficient, careful, humane treatment, not
incarceration in an asylum.
Who is the physician who does not have epileptic males as
his patients, and who does not know of others similarly afflicted,
who are fathers of healthy children and who themselves are
respected, responsible, and creative citizens.
9 That it was possible to add these additional sections as-
sures the certainty that the people of Indiana had not the slight-
est idea of the trap that was being prepared for them, hence
there was no opposition to the passage into law of such sections.
10 If a person shows by his action that he is mentally un·
balanced and becomes vicious or violent, then there is cause for
the physician to have him apprehended, so that he cannot harm
another, and receive the proper treatment while undergoing
tests for his sanity. Laws for the protection of the individual,
and the mass, are proper and should be enforced.

"The judge then rules whether the person should be
committed for treatment or custodial care.11
"Judge Niblack said the temporary section is not
needed and should be repealed next year."
Who, many ask, is in danger of being the next victim of
such new enactments Judge Niblack refuses to enforce?
The answer is simple: Unless you hear nothing, and
see nothing, and above all, say nothing and possess noth-
ing, YOU are in constant danger. Neither your life, nor your
freedom, is your own until either such laws are repealed, or all
judges on the bench are of the Judge Niblack type. May there
soon be a multitude of such!
11 This is a proper procedure with one proviso: That the
psychiatrists are not foreign trained Marxists who are boldly on
record as believing that the non-conformist who does not agree
that the Marxist ideas alone are correct, is mentally unbalanced.

"According to Dr. Bramwell, treatment of mental
illness with the new psychopharmologic drugs has greatly

this point, he said, that the family doctor10 enters the

Many experienced physicians are beginning to realize the
menace of a certain type of Mental Health advocates and psy-
chiatrists of Marxist persuasion. According to newspaper re-
ports, Dr. Harman Harvey, professor in the University of
Southern California who still sees clearly and reasons logically,
is not in favor of frightening the people with the bugaboos of
such terms as "frustration," "maladjustments," and similar
words to cover mental inertia, innate laziness and irresponsi-
bility which the old fashioned hickory whip would have
cured had it been applied in their youth.
According to the report, he refers to these psychotic alarm-
ists as "emotional blackmailers," a rather kindly term for those
who constantly frighten the public to near or downright hys-
teria. He states with clearsighted reasoning that the adjustment
cultists would have the mass trembling at the possibility of
ever experiencing frustration and anxieties. As an example, a
parent who is plagued by his little daughter's insistent questions
and because of misconceptions, dare not respond with a surly1
"go away," for fear of doing irreparable damage to his daugh-
ter's fragile psyche,2 these giving her a "rejection" complex.
This he maintains is palpable nonsense.
"Frustrations and anxieties are part and parcel
of the human package. if we are foolishly or by
inane instructions isolated from them in our youth,
we will have an excellent chance of a nervous

brush aside the questions seriously asked. Instead, if time and
knowledge permits they should be wisely answered. If the time
is not suitable, then the questioner should be kindly informed
why, and when answers will be given.
2 The average psychiatrist and psychologist knows just about
as much of the "psyche," the Soul, as a cat does of raising
chickens.

114 AGE OF TREASON
Many experienced physicians are beginning to realize the
menace of a certain type of Mental Health advocates and psy-
chiatrists of Marxist persuasion. According to newspaper re-
ports, Dr. Harman Harvey, professor in the University of
Southern California who still sees clearly and reasons logically,
is not in favor of frightening the people with the bugaboos of
such terms as "frustration," "maladjustments," and similar
words to cover mental inertia, innate laziness and irresponsi-
bility which the old fashioned hickory whip would have
cured had it been applied in their youth.
According to the report, he refers to these psychotic alarm-
ists as "emotional blackmailers," a rather kindly term for those
who constantly frighten the public to near or downright hys-
teria. He states with clearsighted reasoning that the adjustment
cultists would have the mass trembling at the possibility of
ever experiencing frustration and anxieties. As an example, a
parent who is plagued by his little daughter's insistent questions
and because of misconceptions, dare not respond with a surly!
"go away," for fear of doing irreparable damage to his daugh-
ter's fragile psyche,:! these giving her a "rejection" complex.
This he maintains is palpable nonsense.
"FRUSTRATIONS AND ANXIETIES ARE PART AND PARCEL
OF THE HUMAN PACKAGE. IF WE ARE FOOLISHLY OR BY
INANE INSTRUCTIONS ISOLATED FROM THEM IN OUR YOUTH,
WE WILL HAVE AN EXCELLENT CHANCE OF A NERVOUS
1 It is not desirable that the parent or teacher abruptly
brush aside the questions seriously asked. Instead, if time and
knowledge permits they should be wisely answered. If the time
is not suitable, then the questioner should be kindly informed
why, and when answers will be given.
:! The average psychiatrist and psychologist knows just about
as much of the "psyche," the Soul, as a cat does of raising
chickens.

A Truly American Mental Health Bill
It is reported from California that Senator S. Dilworth,

other Bills that have the WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE IN VIEW.
Compared with all other Bills that will be pigeon-holed or

privilege as Americans, will breathe easier.
It is further reported that Dr. A. L. Baritell, present

stroyed by the continued use of these drugs.
"Mental health, [continued Dr. Greenson] does not

ALWAYS the end product of some effort successfully com-
pleted, and the normal, healthy person has problems he is
facing and trying to solve."
No psychologist, whether religious, mystic, Spiritual or
practical, ever made a statement more certainly based in truth,
than this. We urge for their lasting benefit, that every man and
woman, every young person seeking to attain real success, study
these two statements by Dr. Greenson. In them is contained
the SECRET OF SUCCESS AND OF REAL HAPPINESS, BASED ON
INNER PEACE, AS THE RESULT OF SUCCESS ACHIEVED BY

number of people, who obtain, and take these tranquilizer pills

effect this drug has on the mind, is certainly one of the

Will the American People Remain Asleep
Until it is Too Late to Save Themselves?
While America and other friendly countries were busy
publishing scores of books denouncing Hitler and others for
their attempts to subjugate mankind, by their vicious methods,
American citizens were manufacturing potent, mind and nerve
destroying drugs, and selling them without restriction. Accord-
ing to reputable medical authorities to be quoted, some of these
drugs are powerful enough to destroy both man's mind and his
nervous system, and in less than one fifth the time required by
European methods.
It is well known that all geniuses, artists and outstanding
professional men are high strung and emotional. Their nervous
system can readily be compared to the strings of fine musical
instruments, and, due to this, they are outstanding. If this ten-
sion—it is a tension—is reduced in any manner, by any other
than natural means, the artists, the genius, and the leader in
any field, may quickly become commonplace. This tension of
mind and nerves is the price they must pay, and should will-
ingly pay, for being what they are.
Those artists, geniuses, and leaders who are real at heart,
who love the work in which they are engaged, often seek ways
and means to alleviate the tension when not engaged in their
chosen work by means of some form of physical recreation,
and this is the only natural way. There are millions of
men and women, who are not heart and Soul devoted to their
efforts. These readily fall victims to anything that will oring

"It can't happen here."
This is still the opinion of all but a few Americans, despite
the fact that it is happening every day, possibly to their best
friend or a loved one, and they will not become aware of it
until it is too late. A still greater number believe that Ameri-
cans are too well informed to fall into the various traps set for
them by the enemies of God and man. They do not believe
that drugs openly sold to them are potent to reduce their mental
acumen, their outlook on life, their manhood or womanhood,
their antagonism to anything that would make man less a man,
or interfere with their freedom, their love of family, or interest
in their special activities.
How wrong they are! How utterly wrong! Very few are
aware that there are many methods of brainwashing, methods
far more subtle and innocent appearing than those devised by
the European criminals. Americans are not generally aware
that advertising is the most potent of ALL BRAINWASHING.

Grossly Misleading Information Relative to the
Vicious Destroyers of the Physical, Mental
and Nervous System of Men
Perhaps one of the most misleading items dealing with the
so-called tranquilizing pills, appeared in a "feature" article
in The Sun, Baltimore, Md., March 9, 1958, by Frank Henry.
This is misleading because of the almost certainty that only the
first two paragraphs will be read by many readers.
"Latest in the glittering procession of marvel1 drugs
which mark this era are the little tranquilizer pills that
are flowing by the hundreds of millions from pharma-
ceutical laboratories. Their unique, non-habit-forming2
power over the minds of men and animals has fascinated
the public imagination3 as no other drug ever has done.
1 The use of the word "marvel" at once conveys the idea of
quick relief to the reader, who may be suffering from some
slight indisposition from which he seeks "escape," not cure. The
relief quickly obtained, though in no sense a cure, or the re-
moval of the cause, will naturally induce him to resort to the
same "marvel" whenever he does not feel "up to par" with the
result, that not only is a habit formed, but the cause may become
chronic and incurable.
2 This is a wholly misleading statement. Physicians who
have been called upon to treat those in the habit of resorting
to these "Happy pills," know all too well, that the drug holds
them bound as securely as any narcotic. Combine the idea of
a "marvelous" drug and "non-habit forming" and you have one
more victim.
3 It does have power over the minds of men, and therein
is its danger and destructive potency.

Calming to Patients
"Dr. Enoch Callaway, 3rd, assistant professor of
psychiatry at the University of Maryland Medical School,
says that the judicious use of tranquilizers is calming to
patients, makes them more receptive to psychiatric treat-
ment.
"'Tranquilizers, collectively, are an important tool
for exploration of the human mind,' said Dr. Callaway.
'They have given us the means for pulling aside the cur-
tains just a little to see what goes on beyond.'
"I believe that tranquilizers may open the way for more
extensive use of chemicals in treating mental patients.
In 25 or 30 years from now I think we will be using chem-
icals a great deal more than at present. It doesn't mean
that chemicals will take the place of psychiatry. It means
that the two will work together more effectively."
We have no quarrel with the physician for the use of tran-
quilizers or any other remedy or drug. The physician is qualified
to diagnose his case and prescribe accordingly. The laity is not
so trained, and is not qualified to select a remedy for the imagi-
nary, or real ailment, from which it suffers. Furthermore, the
patients treated are not ordinary cases, but more or less hope-
less mental sufferers for which no certain remedy has yet been
discovered.
Anent this vastly important problem as it concerns the
health, well-being and even sanity of the American people,
there appears to be a conflict between the Physicians as repre-
sented by the American Medical Association, who alone have
the knowledge as a result of experience, of what drugs should
be released to the people, and which should be restricted to the
use of the physician alone, and the Health News Institute.

2 Are such occurrences today frequent in public institutions,
or the environments of public institutions, possibly without the
immediate reprehension of those guilty? Is the public, more
especially women, and children, to be demoralized because of
gross neglect? These things do take place in the undescribable
slums in decadent European countries, but certainly have no
place in America.
3 Enactments after enactments are passed by the various
States for the probable care of the mentally ill. Are such Laws
for the mere control, rather than supervision and care with
intent to cure? This news item would seem to indicate, if not
furnish proof, that there is no supervision of those whose reason
has been destroyed, or who are irresponsible, possibly vicious by
nature, or design.
4 This would indicate that not only is there lack of super-
vision over the inmates of the institution, but that the public,

hospital for acutely ill patients who respond to treatment.
"These included psychiatric units in community gen-

2 In all of the estimated fifty million years of man's existence
on earth the moral inculcations, and efforts, were toward
building a strength that would be at least somewhat stronger
than animal's natural instinct and act. The two main objects
of sex were: (a) Procreation; man becoming a procreator,
and the co-worker with God, and woman as his assistant
in perfecting Love by reproduction; (b) the expression of
Divine Love between man and woman, perfecting this Love as
they transmuted carnal, beastly [lower than animal] passion.
All history, notably that of Babylon, Nineveh, Sodom-Gomorrah
and Greece, proved that sex uncontrolled, demoralized, always
led to the unmentionable vices as illustrated in the story of the
New York "Snake Pit" and by the revelations in the public news
of its votaries in our Capital City. Do parents want their daugh-

they will actually believe this to be education and culture?
Are their lives to be governed as indicated by Fichte, Militant
Socialists, and/or the vicious enemies of man, that the white
race especially if it permits itself to fall victim to the scheme, be
destroyed?
3 This statement is brain washing to perfection. Who is
there who does not want to enjoy a satisfactory existence? One
of the aims and ends of life is to be happy. This is possible only
when there is a clear conscience; the faith and knowledge of a
certainty in the future. When the foreign ideologies emphasize
that there is only a physical existence; that there is no God; no
such thing as Spirituality; no love unless based in sex; that
nothing is really sacred is accepted, then the very foundation on
which happiness and peace of mind must be based, is destroyed.
'This is the unhappy and degrading result of Freud's
Psychology. Freud, consumed by the basic animal passions,
could conceive of nothing as reality except that which was
based on sex. In America, if reports of those with experience
are to be believed, there are now innumerable Psychiatrists,

It is an incentive to carnal relationship when teen-

sex relationship, that such indulgence is necessary to satis-

no indulgences more debasing and degrading.
The (white man's) whole Christian tradition has been

virtue is modesty. The Bible (the Christian's book of
Law) does not teach that ignorance is the same as innocence.
Far from it. The Bible teaches the facts about sex and life.
However, in doing so, the Bible encourages the system of
modesty, reserve, decorum, and delicacy in the relation of boys
and girls, men and women.
Before the intellectuals in England and America were

and morality, respect for, and obedience to parents, to Law and

in the Bolshevik Revolution period in Russia. Parallel to
the development of sexual license, America observed a
very decided manifestation of sadism and sexual perver-
sion. Beginning with the Bolshevik's brutal violation of
the woman's battalion during the days of the October
revolution, cases of violation were pretty frequent . . .
the increase in sexual license manifested itself in dozens of
symptoms similar to the following one: 'During the
October riots in Odessa, hooligans violated girls openly
in the streets.' . .
"During the French Revolution, which [the human
monster] Lenin boasted was just "a dress rehearsal" for
the Russian Revolution, Madelin described "the tremen-
dous growth of sexual sadism ... a kind of epidemic, pull-
ing the clothing off women on public streets. . . ."21

in love. It is a moot question whether the moral character can
ever return to normal after indulgence in unhallowed and
debased practices.
-"Terrible as were these orgies, they were only slightly less
than the frenzies practiced by youths in the University of Cali-
fornia, and other colleges of "higher learning" or "Progressive
education" in different parts of the country to which reference
will be made.
21 Where is the actual difference between the action of the
frenzied Russian hordes—who were not really Russians as mosi
of them had been murdered, but Asiatics—and these students
who are supposedly Christian American boys, raised in Christian
families. Or were they? In Christian families they should have
been taught that the modesty of girls, of sex and sex practices,
are second only to God in sacredness. Nevertheless, we have heard
Legislators excuse these desecrators of all that should be most
Holy: "Oh, it was only a boyish prank!" If so, what is dese-

AGE OF TREASON 195
in the Bolshevik Revolution period in Russia. Parallel to
the development of sexual license, America observed a
very decided manifestation of sadism and sexual perver-
sion. Beginning with the Bolshevik's brutal violation of
the woman's battalion during the days of the October
revolution, cases of violation were pretty frequent ...
the increase in sexual license manifested itself in dozens of
symptoms similar to the following one: 'During the
October riots in Odessa, hooligans violated girls openly
in the streets.' .. .',:!o
"During the French Revolution, which [the human
monster] Lenin boasted was just "a dress rehearsal" for
the Russian Revolution, Madelin described "the tremen-
dous growth of sexual sadism ... a kind of epidemic, pull-
ing the clothing off women on public streets....,,21
consent of the female, the incentive of request, or being normally
in love. It is a moot question whether the moral character can
ever return to normal after indulgence in unhallowed and
debased practices.
:w Terrible as were these orgies, they were only slightly less
than the frenzies practiced by youths in the University of Cali-
fornia, and other colleges of "higher learning" or "Progressive
education" in different parts of the country to which reference
will be made.
21 Where is the actual difference between the action of the
frenzied Russian hordes-who were not really Russians as mO!'>1
of them had been murdered, but Asiatics-and these students
who are supposedly Christian American boys, raised in Christian
families. Or were they? In Christian families they should have
been taught that the modesty of girls, of sex and sex practices,
are second only to God in sacredness. Nevertheless, we have heard
Legislators excuse these desecrators of all that should be most
Holy: "Oh, it was only a boyish prankl" If so, what is dese-
cration? .

"Of course, there are numerous explanations for our
wave upon wave of juvenile crime, but many authorities
who have given much time and thought to a study of the

one of the factors involved. Children filled with revolt
against organized authority, taught to sneer at established

led to believe that 'something for nothing' is the nature

"Of course, there are numerous explanations for our
wave upon wave of juvenile crime, but many authorities
who have given much time and thought to a study of the
problem are agreed that progressive education is at least
one of the factors involved. Children filled with revolt
against organized authority, taught to sneer at established
institutions, left to 'learn' according to their own bend,
led to believe that 'something for nothing' is the nature
of life, can very soon become compliant followers of the

already forged around it, is to destroy the dangerous debased
sex ideas of Freud, which form a foundation of the American
school system and practices of psychiatrists steeped in decadent
European ideas, both in schools and in hospitals. As Cjuoert
states with profound truth:
"Sigmund Freud was discredited as a quack in his
native Vienna. But, for a generation, his twisted theories
have cast a sickening blight over many college text books
in America. Freud saw sex in everything (sex not of the
highest type governed his every thought). Like the found-
ers of progressive education, he warned against 'repress-
ing' or 'inhibiting' the 'free expression of sex activity.'
Neurosis and even insanity were supposed to result from
exercising self-control in matters of sex."
It is not to be suggested for an instant that all schools
or all educational institutions are under the blight of "progres-
sive" education and sex ills. There are many schools presided
over by American minded, and spirited Principals and Directors,
who are doing all in their power to devise means and measures
for proper and full education, and for instilling Moral,. Spiritual
principles of thought and behavior.
"America once upon a time could boast that it had a
public educational system on a par with any in the world.
It was—and still is—a free system; that is, it is supported
by all the people [though they have lost control of it].
And in the true American tradition it was a locally-run
system—a system supported, controlled and administered
by men living and respected in the community where the
school was located, so that no tyrant, no central all-power-
ful government, no benevolent (?) ideologic could tell
them what to teach, or what not to teach, or could say,
with Lenin: 'Give us the child for eight years and it will
be a Bolshevik forever'."—Gordon.

the reader what has been said must be repeated time and again.
Fifty years ago America had a real public school system.
There were local Directors for the school, appointed by the
local taxpayers. The teacher was selected by the Director, and
approved by the parents. The teacher had full authority by the
Board of Directors, and the consent of the parents, to punish
as much, and as frequently, as he thought necessary. Often
the parents punished the child a second' time at home, for an
infringement at school.
The children were IMBUED WITH THE DESIRABILITY, THE
ABSOLUTE NEED, OF AN EDUCATION AND WITH THE NECES-

lessons. There is every indication that they would be allowed

"As it is, they are currently satisfied with a little

several Norfolk high schools. The full story was recently
reported in Norfolk newspapers.
"It seems that each schoolday morning at 8:30 A.M.
Norfolk teenagers have 'rock 'n roll' sessions in the public
school gymnasiums. The pupils come to school early and
hold their 'dances' in the gym, with music supplied by
records played by fellow students.

"When a child disobeys, and doesn't receive punish-
ment, he {or she} feels somethng is wrong, and develops
a sense of insecurity."
In that one sentence is, Biblically speaking, "all the laws
and the prophets." It is plain, common sense. In it is contained
the reason for the child's feeling of insecurity . . . there is
something basically wrong or missing. The youth feels this
even more deeply, and in his search for the reality he uncon-
sciously feels its absence, but cannot define or describe it. He
unconsciously begins to place the blame on his parents, with
loss of respect and confidence in them, then in the school, the
church, government, humanity and even God, leading him into
the "drug" known as crime, just as the drug addict indulges in
narcotics to neutralize a craving that consumes him.
"I often tell them it is better to pay at once for their
misconduct, than pay later with interest."—Emphasis ours.

ness of the child to govern its outlook and actions in the future,
and to help develop manhood or womanhood, self reliance,
personal responsibility, and loyalty as a citizen.

EARLIER YEARS WAS NORMALLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY FOL-

"When a child disobeys, and doesn't receive punish-
ment, he (or she] feels somethng is wrong, and develops
a sense of insecurity."
In that one sentence is, Biblically speaking, "all the laws
and the prophets." It is plain, common sense. In it is contained
the reason for the child's feeling of insecurity . .. there is
something basically wrong or missing. The youth feels this
even more deeply, and in his search for the reality he uncon-
sciously feels its absence, but cannot define or describe it. He
unconsciously begins to place the blame on his parents, with
loss of respect and confidence in them, then in the school, the
church, government, humanity and even God, leading him into
the "drttg" known as crime, just as the drug addict indulges in
narcotics to neutralize a craving that consumes him.
"I often tell them it is better to pay at once for their
misconduct, than pay later with interest."-Emphasis ours.
What a constructive concept to build into the conscious-
ness of the child to govern its outlook and actions in the future,
and to help develop manhood or womanhood, self reliance,
personal responsibility, and loyalty as a citizen.

220 AGE OF TREASON
"An unwed schoolgirl mother and her illegitimate
baby can be the beginning of two ruined lives, the start of
a long road of tragedy and suffering."
Cause and Cure
The beginning of this disease, for such it is, dates back to
the time when American parents accepted the foreign ideology
that children should be permitted free expression in any way they
saw fit. If a child wanted to tear a live bird to pieces, fine! It
was an expression of its personality. If it wanted to pull the hair
of another child, fine! Just another expression of personality.
To interfere, was to cause a repression, bring about a
neurosis. "The spare the rod" ancient remedy was disregarded.
Parents forgot that however sweet a child may be, up to a cer-
tain point, it is an animal. It can learn only by example as it
does walking and talking, and must be GUIDED, DIRECTED,
CONTROLLED; PUNISHED FOR INFRACTIONS OF GOOD BE-
HAVIOR; REWARDED FOR OBEDIENCE AND WELL DOING.
The result was naturally that the child, ungoverned, lost
all respect for its parents. It became confirmed in its disobedi-
ence and entered school with that state of mind. The parents'
lack of control and guidance plus no exercise of demanded
obedience now reached the school. Just as parents had been

vision they used to the limit to teach their Godless, immoral,
do as thou wilt law. The result: we see it in operation.
Man's memory is short. Man has forgotten the "little red
school" house and its success. At that period, as already stated,
the Bible was, in many instances, the text book from which
children were taught.—The first lesson was to instill a rever-
ence to God and obedience to His Will. Respect for, and obe-
dience to parents and teachers were taught to be parts of that
Divine Will.
In this way a wholesome respect, of obedience to law and
order had been thoroughly instilled. Punishment followed
quickly for disobedience in home and school. The parents gave
full authority to the teacher to punish as she or he thought neces-
sary. It bears repeating that if a child were punished in school
for a wrong doing, he frequently was punished a second time
when he came home from school. There were no neurotics
as A result of punishment; instead, God fearing men and
women; successful business men; world famed authors, and
statesmen were developed by these methods.
To eliminate the great evil, parents must again exercise
their responsibility and authority. They must again give the
teacher the right to mete out any punishment indicated. They
must root out every vestige of "Progressive" education and
eliminate all educators(?) who teach that there is no Moral
law, no personal responsibility. They must again take over
supervision of the schools and colleges they support and to
which they send their children.
Boiled down, the great evil had its beginning in the home
and its cure must likewise have its beginning in the home. It
is the responsibility of parents in a true American culture to see
to it that this evil is corrected. They are equally guilty with
the children for every infraction or infringement of law and
order.

The Encouragement of Illegitimacy — Is This Treason
or Merely a Racket for Which Frugal, Hard-
working Taxpayers are Made to Suffer?
Immorality is sin, a blot on womanhood, whether com-
mitted by members of the white, or colored races; by Christian,
Atheist or Jew. There can be no distinction. Whoever is re-
sponsible for making the giving birth of illegitimate children
a lucrative business, cannot be too strongly condemned and
should be made outcasts together with all who live immoral
lives.
No mention will be made of color or race, but it seems
CERTAIN THAT MEMBERS OF THE WHITE RACE ARE MORE
GUILTY IN THE COMMITMENT OF IMMORAL ACTS, THAN
MEMBERS OF OTHER RACES, BECAUSE THE WHITE RACE HAS
HAD GREATER OPPORTUNITIES TO ELEVATE THEMSELVES
THAN MOST OF THE OTHER RACES.
Publicity of this type of immorality and illegitimacy had its
beginning when a news columnist, Tony Weitzel, of the
Chicago Daily News, told about the Chicago Social worker who
helped fill out a questionnaire for an unwed mother of six
children. When asked the question: "Are you employed?" she
answered: "Well, ma'm, I used to go out by the day, but now I
work full time for . . . they send me $190.00 a month."
It is becoming known, and openly admitted, that innumer-
able women in many States, have discovered how to live as they

It became known that during 1955, 1,718 "mothers" of
illegitimate children were recorded in Fulton County, Atlanta,

birth to a baby without a husband.1 But the Legislature thought

To get an idea of how a great nation, example to all the

This cause in its beginning was not Communism as the majority

schools supported by Christians mainly; the suppression of
Christmas carols in public schools and even on city owned
property, and lastly, the omission of prayers at public meetings,
especially the U.N.
(b) The elimination of nations by destroying national
loyalty and love of country.
(c) The abolition of morality by catering to illegitimate
child-birth by means of supporting unwed mothers who make
a business of it.
(d) The destruction of inheritance rights, and ownership
of private property.
Fabianism as such, was organized in London in 1883,
under the name of "The Fabian Society." Its policy was defined
as one of "penetration," the "boring from within." Its aim was
the emancipation of land and industrial capitalism (educators
and many professional men were notoriously poorly compen-
sated, yet had to maintain a respectable front) from individual
ownership, and into the control of a selected group of the com-
munity, ostensibly for "the general good," actually for the
benefit of the master minds, as none of the mass ever benefited
either in England, Russia or any other country.
The Society worked for the extinction of all private prop-
erty, hence its spirit was socialistic, and it was generally known
as "Militant Socialism." The plan included the establishment of
regulations for production, distribution and service for the
"common good," instead of individual profit for those who had
made the effort to build up such property or business.
The Society claimed its intent to be:
1. Propagation of socialism in its application to current
problems affecting the people.
2. The solution of social problems by the application of
the principles advocated by the Society.
3. Practical application by means of legislation.

George Bernard Shaw, as one of its members, informed
the labor government that the Society's only message for the
moment was that the Fabian Society, having made Russia a
mighty Fabian State, was about to select Henry Wallace [the
destroyer of millions of pounds of flesh of pigs which would
have given the poor and working class reasonably priced food]
as successor to the then man in office as president of the United
States. By this statement they admitted the link between
Fabianism and communism in Shaw's gradiose manner.
The Fabians quickly gained power by the class of their
converts, and promoted their aims by training socialists, and
electing them to positions of power, and the organizing of
university committees in England and America for the "per-
meation" of the student body which has always been their pro-
gram. By this time Sidney Webb was chairman of the technical
education which directed all higher education in England and
this system spread rapidly to the American system. The Society
then created a special center in London which they called the
"Political Economic Planning," or P.E.P. [the beginning in
America also of initial names for the multitude of Govern-
mental controlled and directed activities to be initiated later].
The head of this foreign planning committee also later
directed our O.P.A. in Washington. During this time the
N.E.A. and progressive (de) education plan gained
CONTROL OF THE AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. Also
at about this time the League for industrial democracy
AND PUBLIC OWNERSHIP LEAGUE WAS ESTABLISHED.
Good old Harvard University, a traditional American
Institution, followed the School of Economics of the London
University, with Harold Laski reportedly the guiding influence
of both institutions. Students were instructed to enter all train-
ing schools to indoctrinate future leaders, and this most of
them were anxious to do. Did it not make them ASSOCIATES

as successor to the then man in office as president of the United
States. By this statement they admitted the link between
Fabianism and communism in Shaw's gradiose manner.
The Fabians quickly gained power by the class of their
converts, and promoted their aims by training socialists, and
electing them to positions of power, and the organizing of
university committees in England and America for the "per-
meation" of the student body which has always been their pro-
gram. By this time Sidney Webb was chairman of the technical
education which directed all higher education in England and
this system spread rapidly to the American system. The Society
then created a special center in London which they called the
"Political Economic Planning," or P.E.P. [the beginning in
America also of initial names for the multitude of Govern-
mental controlled and directed activities to be initiated later).
The head of this foreign planning committee also later
directed our O.P.A. in Washington. During this time the
N.E.A. and PROGRESSIVE (de) EDUCATION PLAN GAINED
CONTROL OF THE AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. Also
at about this time the League for INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY
AND PUBLIC OWNERSHIP LEAGUE WAS ESTABLISHED.
Good old Harvard University, a traditional American
Institution, followed the School of Economics of the London
University, with Harold Laski reportedly the guiding influence
of both institutions. Students were instructed to enter all train-
ing schools to indoctrinate future leaders, and this most of
them were anxious to do. DID IT NOT MAKE THEM ASSOCIATES
WITH THE WORLD'S INTELLECTUAL LEADERS?

Civil Rights Laws. Civil Rights Legislation in Action.
The Unrighteousness, and Gross Injustices
in These Acts
Reason and common sense would indicate that Civil Rights
Laws would guarantee all men a greater degree of justice and
fair dealing, than was possible under laws already existing, and
it is certain that the majority of people so believed. It would
also seem that the Legislatures of the States that enacted such
Laws, as well as the members of Congress, had this object in
mind. From the very beginning of this legislation it quickly
became apparent that the direct opposite was true; that the
rights and privileges which all men formerly possessed were
taken from the majority and conferred upon the minority.
The cry for fairdealing or brotherhood was the
fabled song of the siren, because "Brotherhood" began to
mean the big brother should, aye, must, give to the little
brother; while the little brother gave nothing in return to his
big brother, i.e., experience has shown that Civil Rights Legis-
lation has resulted in degradation and a form of slavery of the
majority of the descendants of those who made America great.
New York was one of the first States to enact Civil Rights
Laws. How does this human "Rights" Law work in action? To
cite just one instance, an item of news published in the New
York Gazette, December 2, 1956, reported the instance of a
Lake barber who was fined $100.00 for exercising the rights
guaranteed him by the Constitution and refusing to serve

These thousands of Hungarians who were trying to escape

"A Warren County Court on December 1st, returned

Is Civil Rights Legislation not what the lamented Presi-
dent Theodore Roosevelt called Class Legislation, because it
favors one class and would force another class, group or race,
or association of men to be subject to the wishes, or de-
mands of another group? Does it not force a person of one
group to do that which one of another class is free to refuse to
do?
If this barber had been either a Negro or a Jew, an Italian
or member of any other race, and had refused to serve a white
man, a gentile, or member of any other religious denomination,
the millions of gentiles or even atheists, would NOT think of
race or creed, but that he was A free American, and had the
inalienable right to serve, or NOT to serve, whomsoever he
pleased, or to choose to be served by anyone he pleased, but to
have no compelling power, or right to employ force in either
instance.
A well educated, highly placed Negro, known to millions,
posed this question:
"If such a Law is enforceable, how long will it be
before powerful interested groups will have Laws passed
to force, for instance, one colored man in business to serve
another colored man, whether or not such persons are
desirable as customers, or detrimental to their business?
"May not such Laws, especially in certain districts,
interfere with any business in which the colored man
may engage, forcing him to employ those men of his own
race, whether or not they are fitted for the position or the
work? If the white man can be forced by any law to serve
any man, white or colored, then it is only a step further
before the colored man, the Jew, the Hungarian, the Ital-
ian or men of any race will be in the white man's position.

oldest and naturally greatest enemies. No other religious group,
neither Mohammedism, nor Buddhism, is as strongly opposed
to Christianity as is Judaism. Nevertheless, and mark this truth
well: never except possibly in individual instances, have the
Jews been persecuted, or interfered with in America.
Never has either Catholicism or Protestantism interfered
with the arrangements of any President or other public official
to entertain a Jewish layman or statesman, either because of his
moral laws, his teachings contrary to, and in condemnation of
Christianity, or because of his interests in Communism.
Considering these facts, and that in the present instance of
unbelievable public behavior, the Jews4 are accused of being the

question now asked is: Are the Jews ready and willing to allot
to all others the same rights, privileges, respects and oppor-

In contrast to what took place in New York on the ar-

The Brotherhood in Masonry
This cardinal principle in Masonry of accepting a man for
what HE is is one of the fundamentals that has been the
attracting power that has drawn men of the highest qualifica-
tions from every walk of life, and built it into an institution of
many millions of men; men who, once members of the Fra-
ternity sought to reach the highest goal in Masonry by their
own efforts and uprightness.
Even those members of the Masonic bodies who did not
attain to the higher honors of the Fraternity, have always been
proud of being members, as well they might be, and it is doubt-
ful if any of them ever thought that they might be legislated
into second class citizens. Certainly it never occurred to them
that those in the higher ranks proudly wearing the insignia of
their office would, like the legend of the peacock, be put to
shame by the knowledge that they were no longer masters of
their own actions.
As an example, there is a legend—and all legends as the
Nazarene declared are built on facts—that the peacock, proud
as he may well be of his gorgeous plumage, displaying it for
his own glorification and the approval of the female whenever
possible, is always on dangerous ground when he does it. When
his glorious possession—and it is his possession—is spread
in all its wonderous beauty, if he even so much as accidentally
glances at his unusually ugly feet, he feels shame instead of
exultation, and "his tail falls" leaving him in abject common-

"Mr. Chairman, I was an assistant prosecutor at the
Nuremberg trial. It was my job to try to figure out how it
was that Hitler succeeded in imposing his control over the
good German people for so many years. I found that he
did it by decree after decree, just like this piece of legisla-

dividing the people of Germany instead of uniting them.
The only thing that ever made this country great was the
happy blend of labor and management working together.

Mr. Aldrich Blake, a nationally known commentator, in
his book Are Civil Rights Worth It? states in part:
"The President of the United States like all white
men is a 'second class citizen.' He resides in Pennsylvania.
That state has a so-called 'civil rights code.' Under that
code, a Negro, if refused service, may file a legal com-
plaint against the white owner of a private restaurant. His
legal presumption is that the service was refused solely
because the Negro is black. The white owner is subject
to both fine and imprisonment. The same restaurant can
refuse service to the American president (or any other
than a colored person), yet he cannot sue under the civil
rights code because both he and the owner are white.
"There are 19 northern states with compulsory civil
rights codes that apply variously to privately owned and
operated restaurants, cafes, bars, cocktail rooms, hotels,
motels, apartment houses, tourist courts, trailer camps,
barber and beauty shops, dance halls, skating rinks and
swimming pools.
"The millions of white citizens who live in these
states include . . . (even those Hungarians who came to
America to escape liquidation or worse) of whatever
national origin—are all, like the President, second class
citizens (in these states). The Negro, if refused service or
accommodation, has his day in court. The White citizen
does not. This is what the Civil Righters call 'equality
before the law.' In truth, it is iNequality before the law.
It is the grossest sort of Discrimination against the white
citizen (whatever his national origin). A citizen who is
denied equal justice—the most valuable of all human
rights—is, then, a second class citizen."—Emphasis ours.

Nevertheless, we have found that along the western coast
of Christian America there are hundreds of women who HAVE
HAD THEMSELVES STERILIZED BY THEIR OWN REQUEST FOR
THE SOLE PURPOSE THAT THEY MIGHT ENJOY THE PLEAS-

—children. Of the number of women whom we interviewed,
one out of every ten had this operation8 performed. In many
instances, women were not alone the guilty party. One out of
every twenty men so interviewed or who consulted us, either
had their wives commit the sodden deed—or because of their
own desire to avoid responsibilities, or because their wives de-
manded they do so, had the operation performed on them-
selves.
These were not isolated instances. Our trips once a year
were of prolonged duration, our interviews were many. If so
great a number had such operations performed of their own
volition, then it can readily be understood that in these districts
where this practice is prevalent, it would not be too difficult
to convince many more to have such operations, making the
beginning of universal practice possible.
To give the public a general idea of the reason, and state
of mind of all too many women, we quote from a letter re-
ceived from one who herself had not had such an operation per-
formed, but speaks for a friend who consulted her:
"Would you please advise me if I should say any
more to a good friend of mine who is soon to have her
fourth baby in five years. She is planning to have
her tubes TIED, since she says she has tried to be "careful"

such a diabolical act.
Nevertheless, we have found that along the western coast
of Christian America there are hundreds of women who HAVE
HAD THEMSELVES STERILIZED BY THEIR OWN REQUEST FOR
THE SOLE PURPOSE THAT THEY MIGHT ENJOY THE PLEAS-
URES of love-carnal passion, without paying the normal price
-children. Of the number of women whom we interviewed,
one out of every ten had this operation>! performed. In many
instances, women were not alone the guilty party. One out of
every twenty men so interviewed or who consulted us, either
had their wives commit the sodden deed-or because of their
own desire to avoid responsibilities, or because their wives de-
manded they do so, had the operation performed on them-
selves.
These were not isolated instances. Our trips once a year
were of prolonged duration, our interviews were many. If so
great a number had such operations performed of their own
volition, then it can readily be understood that in these districts
where this practice is prevalent, it would not be too difficult
to convince many more to have such operations, making the
beginning of universal practice possible.
To give the public a general idea of the reason, and state
of mind of all too many women, we quote from a letter re-
ceived from one who herself had not had such an operation per-
formed, but speaks for a friend who consulted her:
"Would you please advise me if I should say any
more to a good friend of mine who is soon to have her
fourth baby in five years. SHE IS PLANNING TO HAVE
HER TUBES TIED, since she says she has tried to be "careful"

Emphasis ours.
Admittedly, this woman is having her children too closely
to possess the vitality to give them the strength of mind and
body they should inherit. She is no doubt unable to take the
proper care of them, though history indicates that the greatest
of men and women came from large families where much self-
denial was necessary, making them personally responsible indi-
viduals. In at least the larger cities there are clinics where
natural methods are taught, and practically every family physi-
cian is capable of properly instructing such women in methods
that are neither health, nor Soul destroying.
There is also a psychological law involved; one generally
not foreseen by those who undergo such operations. Man ob-
tains the greatest pleasures from indulgences which involve
most risk; finding this risk removed as in the case of a de-sexed
wife, there is no longer an attraction, and more often than not,
he seeks other avenues for excitement, pleasure and satisfaction.
The woman, much in the same manner, but from another
point of view—a natural one—recognizing that her husband
is no longer a MAN, but a gross bundle of flesh, having lost
his potential for godhood, soon finds the relationship of cohab-
iting with something that is not a man, disgusting. In both
instances, the harmony of the family is destroyed, and the end
result is divorce or worse.

"Conscientious hospitals and surgeons are trying

justified.

"What should be the attitude of doctors toward the
first step in surgical handicraft."
Dr. Whiddon called the operation "barbaric." Part of its
history can be traced. Much for its practice as a tribal religious
custom is clearly outlined in the Bible. The inner concept was
taught by all earlier Arcane Fraternities.
"It is part of the ritual of mutilation by which the
young male, and less often the female (in many non-
Nordic races) was called upon to suffer and give proof of
courage by which they were (are) admitted to the privi-
leges of the tribe or the estate of manhood or womanhood.
"It . . . must be grouped with the various forms of
tribal markings. ... It is also performed to reduce lusty
desires, (and under the belief) that it will make a man a
better warrior for his tribe, a more faithful husband, a
less frequent disturber of the harmony of society. . . ."
It was a first step in the system for final emasculation
of captives in war, that they might be trusted with the women
of their captors; or slaves who would render better service to
their masters, their minds being free from lascivious ideas.
"The distribution of [the practice] circumcision over
the surface of the globe is irregular, and all can be
TRACED TO THE INFLUENCE OF RACE, THE CONQUEROR
IMPOSING THE PRACTICE ON HIS SUBJECTS."
In America it is becoming a fetish among "brain-washed"
surgeons thus involving great numbers of Gentiles not tradi-
tionally governed by tribal-religious customs. It is not generally
recognized that it is an ancient concept of the first step toward
the enslavement of a people.

sacrilegious, to have this operation performed, unless it is ab-
solutely necessary. They maintain that the Creator's handiwork
cannot be improved upon, and that every organ in man's body
is for a specific purpose. Moreover, that a man is not a man
[whole-y] who has had this operation. Certain Arcane Societies
of a Spiritual nature with large memberships, agree with them.
Naturally the atheist and unbeliever will scoff at them.
0 Despite the increasing atheism, especially among those
who feel themselves and their acts governed by science, there is
also an increasing number who the more firmly believe in
Nature, and a God who existed ages before man, and through
whose influence or direction man reached his present state of
physical and mental perfection. These look forward to an Age
of God; that is, of the Spirit, when those who live within Na-

"Eczema of the glans and meatus is not rare in the

"These are the facts. But we must not break our

against infantile circumcision.
"Nonetheless, let us keep our own sanity. When we

" There are religious groups who hold it not only sinful, but
sacrilegious, to have this operation performed, unless it is ab-
solutely necessary. They maintain that the Creator's handiwork
cannot be improved upon, and that every organ in man's body
is for a specific purpose. Moreover, that a man is not a man
[whole-y] who has had this operation. Certain Arcane Societies
of a Spiritual nature with large memberships, agree with them.
Naturally the atheist and unbeliever will scoff at them.
G Despite the increasing atheism, especially among those
who feel themselves and their acts governed by science, there is
also an increasing number who the more firmly believe in
Nature, and a God who existed ages before man, and through
whose influence or direction man reached his present state of
physical and mental perfection. These look forward to an Age
of God; that is, of the Spirit, when those who live within Na-

As the knowledge of what the Militant Socialists and
enemies of mankind propose to do for the degeneracy, the
deterioration of the minds of the people, the idea—the fear—

castration which is openly advocated for the many, by those
making every effort for the subjugation of the masses.
Prior to about 1700, at the time when Primitive Masonry
began to be changed into Speculative Masonry, no one who
had been circumcised was accepted into that or any of the other
Christian secret societies and fraternities. Almost the first ques-
tion asked of the candidate was: "Are you whole of body?" The
question followed by the demand of proof. A man was not con-
sidered as "whole" if he had been circumcised. This is still true
in some of these societies, where circumcision is considered as
the Divine edict separating the Christian from the Jew as re-
gards being a "full" man. After 1700 this was changed to "are
you whole of limb?" by the greater number of the fraternities
and societies.

Little did Dr. Harrower, who may well be called the

a comparatively short time the use of glandular extracts in the
treatment of many diseases would digress into a practice more
degrading than that of the natives of darkest Africa.
Practically everyone who is familiar with the practices of

believed that eating the vital (generative) organs of those they
took prisoners imbued them with the strength and powers of
their victims. It must however be said in their favor, that they
consumed the various organs while the flesh and these organs
were still fresh.
Whether or not the first Organ Therapists were familiar
with this practice and based their therapy on it, no one will
ever know. They did learn by one means or another, that the
Endocrines from animals, fresh or properly prepared, had a
potent effect upon the weakened organs in the human being,
and brought about the cure of many diseases, notably in women,
and weaknesses in man, and were especially potent in Neurotic

The news reJ:X>rt continues:
"Muller said the female productive cycle will be
brought under control, the sex of unborn children will be
prescribed at conception;; and multiple birth will be pro-
duced at will.;; It will be possible, he said, to foreorderi\
identical or fraternal twins.
"In addition to artificial insemination, usmg the
gation, it is a moral-Spiritual Law; moreover, mankind has
always had the means to bring into being human creatures
that might be God-like, super men. Humanity, except in a few
instances, has failed to do so even under the most favorable con-
ditions, and during periods when men were fully conscious of a
divinely given moral, Spiritual sense, fou~d in manhood and
honor based on faith in God. Men in general having degenerated
into immoral irresponsible, repreht>nsible, traitorous beings,
what can be expected as a result of artificial creatures incorporat-
ing nothing more than the grossest material essences'!

The Proposed Sperm Bank—The Devil's Children
Throughout the ages when men conceived of an evil thing
which they did not have the manhood or hardihood to face,
they likewise found a ready excuse for committing, or per-
mitting, that evil. During the past ten years, men(?) have
conceived of more evil methods for the debasement, degrada-

ation of their fellow men than in all ages past.
This had its beginning in America with the mental retro-
gression by means of education; physical and mental deteriora-
tion by means of Toxic substances in water and food for the
mass; various drugs, serums and viruses, apparently for the wel-
fare of the people, but actually for their destruction; mass
breeding; artificial insemination, and now the Sperm Bank.

Throughout the ages when men conceived of an evil thing
which they did not have the manhood or hardihood to face,
they likewise found a ready excuse for committing, or per-

conceived of more evil methods for the debasement, degrada-

This had its beginning in America with the mental retro-

mass; various drugs, serums and viruses, apparently for the wel-
fare of the people, but actually for their destruction; mass
breeding; artificial insemination, and now the Sperm Bank.
An article entitled SPERM BANK-The Brutal Truth We

Atomic fall-out and X-rays are made the excuse for a pro-

Naturally, in conjunction with the conception of the

birth to such ideas. This is found in atheism; total lack in, or
acceptance of the Spiritual possibilities of man; non-acceptance
of the idea of God, with faith only in things seen and felt. To
obtain a proper conception of the unholiness present day advo-
cated, (mental unbalance) such as artificial insemination and
sperm banks, one must possess a firm faith in God; in Spiritual
concepts; in both Natural and Divine Law, and not only be
able to fight these evils, but also be a Servant of God; more
especially Minister or Priest.
That there might be progeny of normal mind, moral fiber,
possessed of Spiritual concepts and operating under the Divine
Law, God or the operating Creative Law, brought forth, not
one, but TWO sexes of opposite nature to act as Co-Creators
with Him. Any general infringement upon this Law brings the
punishment of extinction to man.
This Creative operating Law is in absolute control in the
creation of man, for the reason that included with it, part of it,
or in conjunction with it, there is not only in operation a physi-
cal act under Natural Law, but a Spiritual Law, in the form of
love or affection; and this requires, commands, and damns those
who attempt to set aside the Law.
The Natural Law, even if there were no God, nothing
Spiritual, still demands the conjunction of both male and female
in the woman's conception of a new being; otherwise, bereft of
the potent influence of love and affection, a monster—a devil's
child—Soulless, loveless, Spirituality lacking, morally bereft
creature, will be the result.
We repeat: if there is no such thing as Spiritual verity,
God or a human Soul; only the functioning of a Natural Law,
the operation of which even atheistic scientists cannot deny,
there would still be imposed, the same terrible penalty.

The oft repeated statement that there is a "sperm bank"
for animals does not apply, because animals have no thinking,
reasoning minds, no concept of love, no Spiritual feeling, no

artificial insemination is used.
Furthermore, if there be actual need of a Sperm Bank to
continue the race, it would imply that all men may, or will,
become impotent, what then of a Sperm Bank? How long,
under the most favorable circumstances would such sperms
remain alive? There is still another factor, the uterus is homol-
ogous to the prostrate in man, and the ovum subject to the
same influences the sperm is in man, though not as sensitively,
nor as quickly affected. Can SCIENCE CREATE OVA, or bank

Dr. Lapp continues:
"We must protect semen from harmful radiation.
The only way to do this is to take the sperm now, before
the male population is seriously irradiated. The semen
should be refrigerated and kept in lead-covered Fort
Knoxes and dispersed throughout the nation. Our concern
is with the males, because the female sex cells are not
as susceptible to radiation as those of the male.''
There are others who strongly oppose such an immoral,
unmoral, unSpiritual and non-human procedure as we do.
Among these, as reported in Pageant, is Cardinal Francis
Spellman, one of the great churchmen in America:
"The church has stood against all forms of artificial
insemination and I do not see that there has been sufficient
enough to destroy the ovum, even though that is less sensitive.
Moreover, accepting the possibility that sperms could be kept
alive, it would be far more desirable that the race of man pass
into the limbo of forgotten things, than that an earth be popu-
lated by vicious, sub-human creatures.
This concept that atomic forces will destroy the male's
capacity to procreate, we are aware, is due to the fact that atomic
energy is actually a form of destructive fire. The Bible, in
which few scientists believe, does mention that as in the time of
Noah, the creatures of the world, with few exceptions, were
destroyed by water; so shall the next peoples of the world be
destroyed by fire. Perhaps this prophesy was based on a fore-
knowledge of man's destructive instinct, and that as in past
events, he would again give way to evil and invent the means to
an almost universal devastation. If such a thing is brought about,
all but the "chosen" would be destroyed. If this happens it will
be the viciousness in human nature that is responsible.
5 This -justifies our conclusion that the female sex cell —
the ovum, is susceptible, just as is the male cell, although it is
not as sensitive as is the sperm. Again we question: What about
a bank for ova?

The Cardinal does not state his specific reasons for op-

the objection to artificial insemination, both of which would
entail self-debasement, pollution and the Biblical condemned
self-abuse on the part of the male, and as sinful in the part

The degree to which human beings, created in the image
of their Creator, can descend, was amply verified in the report
from London and printed in the Daily News, January 23, 1958,
under the caption:
"Eva Bartok's Love4 Child Can Call Test Tube Papa
"Milford Haven, first cousin of Prince Phillip, hus-
band of Queen Elizabeth II, had been suggested by many
2 There can be no marriage between the syringe or what-
ever instrument is used, and the woman desiring and requesting
its use, hence the child under civil law, and religious concepts,
cannot be other than illegitimate. Aside from the legal sanctions
of civil law, it is against every Spiritual precept which ordains
that coitus between man and woman must be in affection or
love, to have the sanction of the Divine Law, otherwise its cre-
ation is more or less the result of sex satisfaction, hence animal-
istic. Set aside the Spiritual and religious Law which governs
such relationship between man and woman, and there will be
no Law, and man descends to below the level of the animals
who, without man's reasoning power, obey the laws of their
nature. If such children are to be legitimized, then marriage
and children born in wedlock, become a mockery before God
and man.
3 In this matter of test-tube babies we speak as a Minister,
a servant of God; one who still believes firmly in God, in a
Divine Law, and a Natural Law, and that all who attempt to
evade these laws will be repaid tenfold by the reaction of such
attempted evasion.
Once the church condones this practice then it places its
approval on the Biblically condemned practices of onanism,
self-satisfaction, and pollution, on the part of man, and evasion
on the part of woman of everything man held sacred. There are
then no longer any cardinal sins. "Do what thou wilt," will be
the law.

The degree to which human beings, created in the image
of their Creator, can descend, was amply verified in the report
from London and printed in the Daily News, January 23, 1958,
under the caption:
"Eva Bartok's Love4 Child Can Call Test Tube Papa

band of Queen Elizabeth II, had been suggested by many
~ There can be no marriage between the syringe or what-
ever instrument is used, and the woman desiring and requesting
its use, hence the child under civil law, and religious concepts,
cannot be other than illegitimate. Aside from the legal sanctions
of civil law, it is against every Spiritual precept which ordains
that coitus between man and woman must be in affection or
love, to have the sanction of the Divine Law, otherwise its cre-
ation is more or less the result of sex satisfaction, hence animal-
istic. Set aside the Spiritual and religious Law which governs
such relationship between man and woman, and there will be
no Law, and man descends to below the level of the animals
who, without man's reasoning power, obey the laws of their
nature. If such children are to be legitimized, then marriage
and children born in wedlock, become a mockery before God
and man.
;! In this matter of test-tube babies we speak as a Minister,
a servant of God; one who still believes firmly in God, in a
Divine Law, and a Natural Law, and that all who attempt to
evade these laws will be repaid tenfold by the reaction of such
attempted evasion.
Once the church condones this practice then it places its
approval on the Biblically condemned practices of onanism,
self-satisfaction, and pollution, on the part of man, and evasion
on the part of woman of everything man held sacred. There are
then no longer any cardinal sins. "Do what thou wilt," will be
the law.

Supreme Court.
The Constructive Approach
"What the Negro needs is SELF-improvement made
possibly by greater economic opportunities.' He needs the
kind of education that will fit him to hold down better
jobs and make constructive contributions to society through
honest and productive toil. Merit produces its own reward
[irrespective of the c61or of a man's skin].
"Economic betterment will place the Negro in a
position [as it will millions of white men] to demand
solution of his problems on the basis of achievement. And
to this NO white person will object."
Another well known leader in an article published in

It is unquestionably true that intermarriage has increased
in America during the past few years. This is generally true in
Filmland and higher circles of college life, partly due to a
tactic and often outspoken church system that is becoming
decadent with death to the Christie ideal. The white race, un-
fortunately, is so deeply mentally inert that it is not taking this
matter seriously, and when it does it may be too late. Why
this indifference? Our research among the people reveals a
strong belief that the women moving in these circles are actually
morally decadent and of little account. Once there is an indi-
cation that such intermarriages are becoming frequent among
more conservative groups, there will be, it is promised, im-
mediate, and, "deadly" reaction. Knowing, as we do, from past
crises how Americans think and REact, one can readily com-
prehend how this will be.
A Prediction
Dr. Guy B. Johnson, professor of Sociology, University of
North Carolina, predicts that if the present trend toward a
social mingling continues the Negro and white race in America
will be thoroughly integrated in 500 years. This is probably
the number of years it took -m India and Egypt to bring the
downfall of the races.
This is undoubtedly a true prediction and if so, the white
race will have committed moral and Spiritual suicide by
simply following in the footsteps of the white races in past
ages.
If the powerful minority groups will continue to be given
their way by the sanction of authority and succeed in having
the decaying white man, then certainly threat of revolution, made
by a leader of the Soviet, should do so. It is not an idle threat
as Russia has proven so fully in many countries in the old world.
If the white man does not awaken, then he amply deserves what-
ever may happen to him.

"The real goal of race-mixing attempted in America

audience this month.
"Allen Nevis,- history professor at Columbia Uni-

Illinois, that the present generation must plan 'to raise the
Negro10 race' to a plane in character, cultivation, and
manners where they will be entirely fit to intermarry17
with the White race.
In passing let us emphasize the fact that we do NOT blame
the Negro. It was not his Utopian dream, but the scheme of
white and mixed race men for the admitted purpose of using
the Negro in furthering their Own interest, as perhaps inad-
vertently admitted by Foster.

316 AGE OF TREASON
"The real goal of race-mixing attempted in America
is intermarriage, a left-wing historian1:> told an Illinois
audience this month.
"Allen Nevis; history professor at Columbia Uni-
versity, told a symposium at Knox College, Galesburg,
Illinois, that the present generation must plan 'to raise the
NegrolH
race' to a plane in character, cultivation, and
manners where they will be entirely fit to intermarry1i
with the White race.
In passing let US emphasize the fact that we do NOT blame
the Negro. It was not his Utopian dream, but the scheme of
white and mixed race men for the admitted purpose of using
the Negro in furthering their Own interest, as perhaps inad-
vertently admitted by Foster.
Plot Exposed
In revealing the true aim of the race-mixers, Nevis con-
1;; This "historian" is certainly more honest than the usual
ones advocating desegregation. If all were equally honest, the
white man might awaken from his Utopian dream, a dream
that has been the downfall of every great nation before this.
Iti An utterly illogical, unfair, dangerous and ungodly con-
cept. Who was there to help the Pilgrims to disembark on an
unfriendly soil, a wilderness filled with hostile Indians, no
homes, little food, children, and nothing to look forward to but
suffering and hard work, with death staring them in the face?
Who was there to raise them in character, cultivation and man-
ners? Did they wait for some ministering angels to come and
bring them food or raise it for them; cut timber to build log
houses without conveniences, schools the like of which few
people ever saw, and fight the Indians for them? Not at all,
they just "dug in" and trusted God.
17 The professor evidently forgot himself and made a false
step, saying that "after all of this is done for them (not by
them) they will be entirely fit to intermarry with the white roce."

ceded that the idea of racial intermarriage is unpopular, and
causes [real] Americans "to flinch before it." But he added,
the generations of 1958 must accept this hard, grim fact, not
evade it, and must make plans for meeting it.
"Once the Negro is well educated, as well man-
nered,1 N as well paid, and as well guided18 as the
white man—once the colored race has become socially
economically, and culturally the absolute equal18 of the
white race, as it must become,18 then intermarriage will
become frequent.
"Nevis is identified with 'Liberal' elements, and has
won a Pulitzer Prize for history. He spoke at Knox College
observance of the centennial of one of the Lincoln-Douglas
debates."
It would appear that the Methodist Church, after years
of independent growth, must now depend on their colored
brethren for progress and expansion within their ranks, as the
following news item indicates:
"Negro Influx Termed Field for Methodism

18 It is well to note the many exceptions to inter-marriage,
but did Nevis and others like him take into consideration that
the white race has had thousands of years of experience, suffer-
ing, hard labor, deprivation and lastly, education of every
description and culture, while the Negro has actually had less
than a century of education and few opportunities for culture.
Can anyone believe that this gap can be covered either by a
decree of Court or even Herculean effort?

areas, a speaker told the Methodist Board of Missions
today.
"The board, meeting here this week, heard a report
by the Rev. Dr. Charles E. Golden, of Philadelphia, a
director of its Division of National Missions that Chicago's
non-white population increased by 197,000, Pittsburgh's
by 21,000 and Cleveland's by 63,000 between 1950 and
1956.
"These figures are suggestive not only of the rapid
replacement of whites in the city, especially the inner city,
but also of the overcrowding with its resultant complica-
tions and problems," he said.
"Another report informed the board that offers to
sponsor refugees arriving from overseas are urgently
needed by the Methodist Committee for Overseas Relief."
What of the Children of Mixed Marriages
Against Both Divine and Natural Laws?
These children, thousands upon thousands, now born
mostly out of wedlock, breeds, denied the opportunity to develop
a sense of decency, morality, personal responsibility, or of family
life, will be, with few exceptions, worse than animals, as is now
recognized, because animals live naturally while men irrespec-
tive of color, must develop these instinctive traits.
The white women, more than anyone else, will suffer
most if the evil is permitted to continue. Why so? Because
it is their husbands in their official capacity who pay out
millions of hard-earned money (much of which belongs to
the wives of white men) to support these illegitimates,
in some cases as many as eleven children to a single
female. It is the payment of this money that encourages the
PROMISCUOUS BREEDING BY WOMEN OF THIS CHARACTER.

Another evil born of this trade, for such it is, is the fact
that thousands of white men who once patronized brothels
have now transferred their "affection" to these colored, and even
some white females, because of no need to pay. It is a business
investment on the part of the females. The State pays the
bills in support of their mongrel illegitimates. How desperate
this evil has become is indicated by two items:
"In the metropolis of The City of Brotherly Love,
86 per cent of the illegitimate births recorded were Negro
—3464 and only 662 white."
"One 40-year-old unmarried woman has 14 chil-
dren, nine of whom are on relief. The others were too old.
This woman was receiving $189.00 a month relief, even
though the father of six children is living with her."

sions than we Americans, but conservative as they may be, it
appears that the general opinion is adverse to race mixing, and
that they are aware of the dangers involved to the white race as
a result of which the colored man would be certain to suffer,
though possibly not so soon as the white man.
It would be well if our legislature (we have few states-
men) were to give consideration to a statement made by the
Earl of Pert, Minister of State, Colonial Offices:
"Racial discrimination is NOT something which can
be cured by a simple legislative stroke. To legislate might
well have the opposite effect to what was intended. To
enforce such legislation would present tremendous diffi-
culties. . . ."
The American people are learning this fact the hard and
difficult way, destroying within a short time all that had been
gained through the past near century.
The House of Lords debate brought to light:
"The result of these circumstances [the influx into
England from Jamaica and her colonies] and differing
social traditions has been the production of considerable
numbers of illegitimate children, and it is worth consider-
ing what has happened to some of them. There have been
two waves of admission to residential nurseries of illegiti-
mate colored children since the latter part of the war. The
FIRST RESULTED FROM THE ADVENT OF COLORED AMER-
ICAN servicemen and, to a less extent, of Africans dur-
ing the latter part of the war and years of demobilization.
. . . Socially, the half-caste (mongrel) children are ser-
iously handicapped because their mothers themselves are
frequently18 irresponsible and tend to reject them, and
foster parents and adopters in general do not want them.
Exactly what is happening here in America.

AGE OF TREASON 325
sions than we Americans, but conservative as they may be, it
appears that the general opinion is adverse to race mixing, and
that they are aware of the dangers involved to the white race as
a result of which the colored man would be certain to suffer,
though possibly not so soon as the white man.
Ic would be well if our legislature (we have few states-
men) were to give consideration to a statement made by the
Earl of Pert, Minister of State, Colonial Offices:
"Racial discrimination is NOT something which can
be cured by a simple legislative stroke. To legislate might
well have the opposite effect to what was intended. To
enforce such legislation would present tremendous diffi-
culties...."
The American people are learning this fact the hard and
difficult way, destroying within a short time all that had been
gained through the past near century.
The House of Lords debate brought to light:
"The result of these circumstances [the influx into
England from Jamaica and her colonies] and differing
social traditions has been the production of considerable
numbers of illegitimate children, and it is worth consider-
ing what has happened to some of them. There have been
two waves of admission to residential nurseries of illegiti-
mate colored children since the latter part of the war. THE
FIRST RESULTED FROM THE ADVENT OF COLORED AMER-
ICAN SERVICEMEN and, to a less extent, of Africans dur-
ing the latter part of the war and years of demobilization.
. . . Socially, the half-caste (mongrel) children are ser-
iously handicapped because their mothers themselves are
frequently18 irresponsible and tend to reject them, and
foster parents and adopters in general do not want them.
18 Exactly what is happening here in America.

Is this evasion of Divine and Natural Laws to continue,

to the need of obedience? There is!
One of the oldest teachings relative to man's future,
is that which was accepted by untold billions in the past, now
believed by millions. It is the teaching that man returns to
earth, generally known as reincarnation. The Bible deals
somewhat with this Law.
According to this concept, the Soul of man returns to
earth time and again until it has fulfilled its destiny according
to the law of its release from heaven in the first place.
This concept is that a man may have a great love to
achieve a specific goal during his earth life and make effort
toward that end, but fail to succeed. If, however, he did all in
his power to succeed, then on his return to earth he will be
drawn into an environment which will enable him to achieve
the desired end.
Further than this, the Soul need not return to again be of
the same race—the Egyptians never wanted to leave Egypt or be
of any other race, hence they had themselves embalmed so that
their migration would be impossible. Under this concept, the
Negro may wish to return as a white man or of any other
nation, and if it is his real desire, so will it be. This would solve
the race problem.

the creation of the different races: each race with a different
destiny to reach a common end. This idea accepted, each race
must work out its own destiny, just as must each individual of
all races. It cannot be accomplished by intermarriage; if it
could, there would have been no reason for the creation of the
different races in the first place, otherwise God were guilty of
a serious mistake. This, to those who believe in a God and an
exact law, is unthinkable; nor did the writer of Genesis think so
when he transcribed the law succinctly stated in a few words:
"Everything after its own kind."
The Rev. G. T. Gillespie, D.D., President Emeritus of
Bell Haven College, Jackson, Miss., in a booklet: A CHRISTIAN
VIEW OF SEGREGATION, outlines in brief, the Biblical teach-
ings or Divine Law. He gave his own conclusions to which the
most learned among the colored people in America agree:
"Integration is not the means to race improvement
[but of race deterioration]."
"Segregation is one of Nature's universal laws.a
"Segregation tends to promote progress.6

Thomas Jefferson, author of the immortal Declaration
of Independence devoted much attention and study to the Negro

to say:
"Nothing is more certainly written in the book of
fate than that these people are to be free; nor is it less
certain that the two races, equally free, cannot live under
the same government. Nature, habit, opinion, have drawn
indelible lines of distinction between them. It is still in
our power to direct the process of emancipation and de-
portation peaceably."
Abraham Lincoln, venerated and almost deified by the
Negro race as their "Great Emancipator" and unfailing friend,
in a speech made at Charleston, Illinois, September 18, 1858,
said:
"I will say then, that I am not now, nor ever have
been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and
political equality of the white and black races . . . and I
will say in addition to this, that there is a physical differ-
ence between the white and black races which I believe
will forever forbid the two races living together on terms
of social and political equality."

In an address made to a group of free Negroes at the
White House, August 14, 1862, Lincoln further stated his
convictions:
"You and we are different races. We have between
us a broader difference than exists between any other
two races. Whether it is right or wrong I need not dis-
cuss, but this physical difference is a great disadvantage
to both of us, as I think. ... If this is admitted, it affords
a reason, at least, why we should be separated."
Dr. Gillespie comments that "It is the greatest disaster
which ever befell the South and the Nation when Lincoln's
plan for colonization of the American Negro in Africa or the
West Indies, was defeated by his tragic and untimely death."
Booker T. Washington, the most influential leader and
greatest benefactor of the Negro race—perhaps in the whole
history of the race as well as in his own generation, in a notable
speech given at the Atlanta Exposition in 1895 sounded the
keynote of his philosophy, thus:
"The wisest among my race understands that agi-
tation of questions of social equality is the extreme folly,
and that progress in the enjoyment of all privileges that
will come to us must be the result of severe and constant
struggle rather than of artificial forcing. No race that has
anything to contribute to the markets of the world is long
in any degree ostracized. It is important and right that all
privileges of the law be ours, but it is vastly more im-
portant that we be prepared for the exercise of these
privileges."

It is further reported that the bill was tabled as a result of
a move made by Rep. W. C. Parker of Baxley. After Parker had
made the move, Rep. James Mackay of Decatur declared that the
bill was opposed by the Georgia Hospital Association, and by
persons connected with the Red Cross" blood banks. Parker is
stated to have declared: "If I were dying, I wouldn't care what
kind of blood I got if it saved my life. Besides, I think I have
enough white blood that it would overcome any little dab of
any other kind I might need to remain alive.'"'
Would he likewise agree to have the blood—or a bit of
it—from one suffering from syphilis? In the ultimate results
there would be little difference.
In defense of the Red Cross it is reported that John S.
Billings, Director of Field Service, Southeastern Area, Ameri-
can National Red Cross, had previously declared that:
"Whenever necessary to insure the success of the plan,
chapters will collect and hold [blood] in such a manner as
to give the physician, and patient, the right of selection
at the time of administration."
This would be considered by Americans as the natural and
American way—the right of self-selection. Unfortunately, it is
also said that Dr. Howard H. Montgomery, Director of the East-
ern Area Blood Program, American National Red Cross
stated, without reserve, that:
"The race of the donor has not been shown on any
legislation? The medical profession should be permitted to
answer this question for themselves.
5 Following the defeat of the bill, many of those who had
supported the Red Cross declared that they could no longer
support the organization morally or Spiritually. This resolution
appears to be spreading.
6 It is questionable if this manner of reasoning would be
acceptable to physicians of long experience in blood diseases.

stated to have declared: "If I were dying, I wouldn't care what
kind of blood I gOt if it saved my life. Besides, I think I have
enough white blood that it would overcome any little dab of
any other kind I might need to remain alive."';
Would he likewise agree to have the blood---or a bit of
it-from one suffering from syphilis? In the ultimate results
there would be little difference.
In defense of the Red Cross it is reported that John S.
Billings, Director of Field Service, Southeastern Area, Ameri-
can National Red Cross, had previously declared that:
"Whenever necessary to insure the success of the plan,
chapters will collect and hold [blood] in such a manner as
to give the physician, and patient, the right of selection
at the time of administration."
This would be considered by Americans as the natural and
American way-the right of self-selection. Unfortunately, it is
also said that Dr. Howard H. Montgomery, Director of the East-
ern Area Blood Program, American National Red Cross
stated, without reserve, that:
"The race of the donor has not been shown on any
legislation? The medical profession should he permitted to
answer this question for themselves.
:> Following the defeat of the bill, many of those who had
supported the Red Cross declared that they could no longer
support the organization morally or Spiritually. This resolution
appears to be spreading.
6 It is questionable if this manner of reasoning would be
acceptable to physicians of long experience in blood diseases.

In further reports that in a letter under date of
November 22, 1957, Dr. Sam T. Gibson, Director of Blood
Program, American Red Cross, justified mixing blood:
"Persons suffering from sickle cell anemia7 are ex-
cluded as blood donors by the hemoglobin test just as any
other person with anemia is excluded. The defect (sickle
cell anemia) exists in the forming organs, and cannot be
transmitted by the blood cells themselves.8 There is no
difference in the blood of humans based upon race or
color."9
Through more recent medical and scientific conclusions to
the danger of the dread sickle-cell, the cause of an incurable
form of anemia in the Negro, being conveyed to the white man
by the diffusion of blood, even greater possibilities have
opened up.
Dr. T. R. Montgomery is reported as giving his opinion:
"Since it is conceded that blood contains the various
secretions of the body glands such as the testicles,10

transmitted, why the need of the tests for them, if they are ever
made. If these cells cannot be transmitted, in what manner do so
many Negroes become the victims?
9 This statement is questioned by many physicians long ex-
perienced in anemic and sickle cell diseases. The transmission
of the disease being questionable, who is willing to take the risk
when it can be avoided by the simple method of labelling blood?

precautions are no longer necessary?

secretions have a bearing on the psychological attitudes of
people, why would not the administration of Negro blood
to a white person finally have a pro-Negro effect on the
psychological thinking of that person? Could it not affect
the whole course of that person's future life?"
The Ever-Active Psychological Law
Perhaps more powerful, though slower in the degenera-
tion of the races as a result of intermarriage and procreation by
Negro and white, is the ever active Psychological Law.
The classical example is that of Othello, the Moor, and
his Nordic or Caucasian wife. Shakespeare gave this much
thought and Othello was the result.
Here you have several factors at work:
Othello, a Moor, somewhat dark of color, was not actually
with the impregnation of an ovum by a single cell, or sperm,
released by the testes. In that single seed, or sperm, is contained
the whole of the future human being: his body, his mind, his
emotional, and Spiritual nature. The spirit of these seeds, or
sperm, are not only found in the blood stream, but even in the
spinal fluids, and brain cells. Any content in the blood trans-
fused, or diffused, into the body from external sources would
naturally mix, and become part, of the person receiving it, and
cannot help but directly affect both the physical, and mental
nature, of such a person. An old maxim has it: "In the blood
is the life, and nature of the person." This "life and nature" is,
in some degree, transferred from one person to another.
11 More than a hundred years ago Dr. P. B. Randolph
boldly made the statement that "A white woman bearing the
child of a Negro will never again be able to bear a pure white
child." The nature or germ of the Negro, via the ovaries and
uterus, hence the blood, contaminated her blood stream as cer-
tainly as if she had syphillis transmitted to her at the same time
she became pregnant as a result of relationship with a person
having that disease. Dr. Randolph's statement has, to our
knowledge, never been contradicted.

be unaware of what it is, but little things will cause him to
reason: "Can she, this white woman, really love me, or, as has so
often been maintained, is it merely passion and of a temporary
nature." He begins to feel that he may really not be as good
as she. He remembers that he is colored. He becomes more con-

something that will prove to him that she does not love him;
does not respect him; that he is, after all, just a Negro.

In the Othello tragedy, there was no actual reason. They
loved each other, but the psychological factor was present and
required only something to set it into action. This was supplied
by one whom Othello considered a friend, but who, with
evil intent, sowed the seed of suspicion in Othello's mind.
Othello was made conscious of the fact that irrespective
of his position, he was after all a Moor, and how was it possible
for so beautiful a woman, a white woman of culture, beauty
and virtue, to love him?
This Psychological Law in respect to races is ever active,
and with the exception of the white wife who is awmoral, the
end is nearly always the same. History is replete with the fall of
nations that had achieved almost unbelievable greatness, and
then fell into decay in great part as a result of inter-marriages.
Among these ancient nations were India, Egypt, Greece and
Rome. The Spanish nation degenerated, because of the inter-
marriage of her soldiers in the colonies weakening the mother
nation. The history of Portugal offers an instance clearly
illustrating the results of enforced intermarriage.

CHAPTER TEN
The Law of Reaction Cannot Be Evaded
Even by the Gods
More than a year ago we made every effort to point out
the certainty that both the decisions of the Supreme Court,
relative to segregation, and the proposed Civil Rights Law, if
enacted, would back-fire to the great disadvantage of those agi-
tating for it, and again make men who had—not won—been
given a questionable freedom, would find themselves in a worse
condition than they have been since the days of slavery.
This is right now rapidly coming to pass, not in the
South, but in the North. It is not as a result of any-
thing THE GENERAL MASS OF WHITE MEN ARE DOING, BUT
specifically results from the great influx of
Negroes from the South to the larger northern
cities. This is responsible for the rising cost of rents, even in
the most undesirable neighborhoods, far beyond anything the
working class is able to pay. In part, it is also responsible for
throwing thousands out of employment, besides interfering
WITH THE FUNCTIONING OF NATURAL LAW GOVERNING
THE SETTLEMENT OF A MASS OF PEOPLE IN A NEW ENVIRON-
MENT ALREADY OVERCROWDED.
It is no longer the "yellow" or "scandal" sheets that recog-

CHAPTER TEN
The Law of Reaction Cannot Be Evaded
Even by the Gods
More than a year ago we made every effort to point out
the certainty that both the decisions of the Supreme Court,
relative to segregation, and the proposed Civil Rights Law, if
enacted, would back-fire to the great disadvantage of those agi-
tating for it, and again make men who had-not won-been
given a questionable freedom, would find themselves in a worse
condition than they have been since the days of slavery.
This is right now rapidly coming to pass, NOT IN THE
SoUTH, BUT IN THE NORTH. IT IS NOT AS A RESULT OF ANY·
THING THE GENERAL MASS OF WHITE MEN ARE DOING, BUT
SPECIFICALLY RESULTS FROM THE GREAT INFLUX OF
NEGROES FROM THE SOUTH TO THE LARGER NORTHERN
CITIES. This is responsible for the rising cost of rents, even in
the most undesirable neighborhoods, far beyond anything the
working class is able to pay. In part, it is also responsible for
throwing thousands out of employment, besides INTERFERING
WITH THE FUNCTIONING OF NATURAL LAW GOVERNING
THE SETTLEMENT OF A MASS OF PEOPLE IN A NEW ENVIRON·
MENT ALREADY OVERCROWDED.
It is no longer the "yellow" or "scandal" sheets that recog-
nize this, but such highly respectable and authoritative publi-
cations as The Wall Street Journal, The Evening Bulletin
(Philadelphia), the U. S. News and World Report, and others.
As an introduction to this chapter, we quote, with com-
ment, from the U. S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT:

CHAPTER TEN
Section One
Anothel' City Awakens From Its Slumber
In seventy-nine years of life, we have seen many changes
of habits, proceedings and reversals of opinions, but in all
those years nothing compares to the public ACTION AND RE-
ACTION to the Negro question.
When the second and revised edition of THE AGE OF
TREASON was placed into the hands of an editor, it was strictly
taboo for newspapers to use the word Negro, and the Negroes
as a whole bitterly resented anyone doing so, Now, before the
copy can go to press there is a complete reversal in both the
press, and the outspokenness of the better and more substantial
class of Negroes. This made it necessary to eliminate much of
what had been added to the Chapter on SEGREGATION to find
room for the new appraisal on the subject.
The Sundtly Bulletin, (Philadelphia) May 4, 1958 edition
tells the sad story under the heading:
"City Stirred by Negro Crime Wave"
"Public Shocked by Latest ~Iurdcr, but Its Memory is Short"
"By John C. Calpin

place in relation to the public opinion of the citizens of the
City of Brotherly Love, after the "dog had bitten the hand

"We wonder how long the present public indigna-

forgotten except by the widows and orphans or families

"All week since the senseless killing by some 'under-
privileged' youths who had been refused admission to a
dance, there have been statements made. There have been
statements by the police; statements by judges denying
any softness toward crime; statements attacking the police;
statements praising them; discussions of police dogs to
work with beat patrolmen; of the shortage of police and
of faulty police techniques/
1 Despite the terrible crimes committed against the innocent
citizens of Philadelphia, the many robberies and assaults, the
newspapers did not want to, or did not dare, report who com-
mitted them. Moreover, the "legal mills" did not even grind
slowly to see that justice was done to the victims. Both the
people, and officials not directly affected, made all manner of
excuses for the criminals.
All of this time, because nothing was done to control the
situation, because they ivere Negroes, (and it was their nature),
the "wind was developing into a whirlwind." The citizens of
Philadelphia, as in other cities, are reaping the results of their
laxity in meting out justice and punishing those who committed
the various crimes as they have, and would have—if they had
been white men. There can be no difference in justice because
of race or creed.
- All this is superficiality. Excuses! When the first crime was
committed it was the duty of all public officials involved in the
enforcement of the Law, to act, irrespective of the fact that it
was a Negro, instead of a white man who was guilty.
Will the honest citizens of Philadelphia deny this? If the
officials—no matter what their position—failed to act, then it
ivas the duty of all citizens en masse to demand action be taken
by the officials and justice, with proper punishment be meted
out. Failing to do this, they as citizens, were as guilty of encour-
aging crimes, as the officials. Will anyone deny this?

CHAPTER ELEVEN
A Master Race — By What Standard Can a Master
Race be Recognized?
You cannot recognize a Master Race by its own claims
and pretentions, nor by its ability to subjugate other races, by
one means or another, to its Will. The only standard for judg-
ment must be by its achievements, tolerance of other races, re-
sistance to interference by individuals, groups or races, humani-
tarianism, morality, acceptance of the Law of Personal Responsi-
bility, and ABOVE ALL ELSE, pride of race, whatever that race
may be.
Is this pride of race not a cause for intolerance? Not at
all. Every individual, irrespective of his race, should take pride
in his race because God created him so; his creation being under
the Divine Law, that Law must be fulfilled.1 This is possible
only if he accepts the Law and harmonizes his thoughts, desires
and actions with it. He is an individual of a race, and whatever
he does, must be done without interference with or from any
other race, or dependence upon another race.
Because of a man's pride in his race, he should do all in
his power to raise the standards of that race by example; help
it to achieve great works, and build a high morality, a culture
that not only compares favorably in every respect with the
most advanced of all races, but supersedes it.

CHAPTER ELEVEN
A Master Race - By What Standard Can a Master
Race be Recognized?
You cannot recognize a Master Race by its own claims
and pretentions, nor by its ability to subjugate other races, by
one means or another, to its Will. The only standard for judg-
ment must be by its achievements, tolerance of other races, re-
sistance to interference by individuals, groups or races, humani-
tarianism, morality, acceptance of the Law of Personal Responsi-
bility, and ABOVE ALL ELSE, pride of race, whatever that race
may be.
Is this pride of race not a cause fot intolerance? Not at
all. Every individual, irrespective of his race, should take pride
in his race because God created him so; his creation being under
the Divine Law, that Law must be fulfilled.1
This is possible
only if he accepts the Law and harmonizes his thoughts, desires
and actions with it. He is an individual of a race, and whatever
he does, must be done without interference with or from any
other race, or dependence upon another race.
Because of a man's pride in his race, he should do all in
his power to raise the standards of that race by example; help
it to achieve great works, and build a high morality, a culture
that not only compares favorably in every respect with the
most advanced of all races, but supersedes it.
It is a Law of races, that the moment a race loses pride
1 When this pride in race is lacking, or is lost, then an in-
feriority complex develops, and such a race will, almost as a
whole, seek to obtain by force, legislation, or any other means,
privileges and opportunities it is incapable or unwilling, of
earning for itself. Roce conflicts result and will continue until
one or the other becomes a subjective roce.

in its race, its decline has begun; decadence has set in, and it is
only a matter of time, and the building up of another race,
before it will become a secondary race.
This is not only a Natural Law, it is a Biological Law; it
is a law of survival, and it is a Divine Law. This Law, one
of selectivity, had its beginning with man, and has governed
all men throughout the ages.
How, specifically, does a race become a master race?
By the development of the individual who awakens to a
pride in himself—not a selfish pride, but one in his birth as of
a race; to the trust placed in him by his creator; to a
faith, confidence and a certain degree of egotism in
his capability to achieve, and a reliance on the Biblical assurance
THAT EVERY MAN IS ENDOWED WITH THE NECESSARY
TALENT, TO MAKE OF HIMSELF A SUPER MAN, IF HE IS
WILLING TO MAKE THE NECESSARY EFFORTS TO DEVELOP
THESE TALENTS HIDDEN WITHIN—A PART OF HIMSELF—
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT.
Would not this acceptance of the three laws: natural,
personal, and Divine, tend to make him egotistical in the
sense that he would think of himself and his race as specifi-
cally selected, or brought into being for the express purpose
of becoming the Master race, dominant over all others?
It would not, because this development into a superior
being as a result of accomplishments, is not the re-
sult OF RACE, IT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE COLOR. It recognizes
only one thing: THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAN'S INNATE, IN-
BORN, THOUGH GENERALLY DORMANT POTENTIAL.
If he obeys the Laws of such development, he becomes
the super man. The proof of the Master race is in its achieve-
ments, AND ITS TOLERANCE OF ALL OTHER RACES, AND
INTOLERANCE TO INTERFERENCE.
Who among all the races today stands foremost in its
accomplishments? Is there any question about it? To what

That Egypt actually was founded by a white race, and
built into its mighty estate by Aryans, possibly from ancient
India, has been authoritatively shown by Colonel Earnest Sevier
Cox, of Richmond, Virginia, in his book first published in 1937,
and accepted by many of the greatest institutes of learning. It
proves as conclusively as possible, that Egypt was founded by
a blonde people, coming from a Mediterranean branch of the
white race:

with flowing golden hair, which means that these early
Greeks, the founders, originated in Northern Europe, and
thus were descended substantially from the same stock as
the present day hard, energetic Scotch, English, Irish,
Germanic, Scandinavian and related Nordic strains —
kinsmen of Washington, Jefferson, MacArthur.
"The blond and brunette strains of Nordic stock
probably are indistinguishable in other characteristics;
but inasmuch as the only race which produced blonds is
Nordic, or Northern European, we have indisputable
evidence of the racial origin of early Greece. Skulls and
skeletons confirm Homer, of course, revealing Nordic
heads and bony structure.

soil, the rivers, which the Creator generously put here.

will say that Homer's story is built on legend, but if so, this
proves a great deal more than the exact fact. It proves that the

and privileges which the white race earned for itself, and a
desire for the close association with that race.

AGE OF TREASON
It has been said of the colored race that they are the oldest
of God's children, and therefore should be favored. Is this claim
justified by facts? If so, where are their great works; their cul-
ture, morality, Spirituality, and their self-built cities governed
by just laws, the result of untold centuries of experience?
Many Asiatics, a conglomeration of races, all of them age
old, some of them at one time or another having a culture
almost beyond compare, but long since fallen into Spiritual
decadence, are now in absolute control over millions, and claim
the right to all power and dominance. Where is there a sign
of justice to even their own people; their glory, morality, kind-
ness, generosity, benevolence,—all that makes of men, MEN?
All that remains, judging by their acts, is murder, rapine,
degradation, brutality by the stronger over the weaker; a
recurrence to the worst features of inhumanity.
If the Jews throughout the centuries had the right, or
took to themselves the privilege without objection, of claiming
to be "God's chosen people," but have failed to prove their
inheritance, does not the white man, the Aryan, the Caucasian,
have the same right to claim that his is the Master race? What
has the white man done to prove it? He has progressed farther
than all other nations in inventive ability, making the lot of
all men, easier. He has manifested a universal generosity un-
known to the rest of the races. His culture was slow in the
process of overcoming his lesser tendencies. In a few hundred
years he has accomplished more than all other races put to-
gether. There is a debit side: the white man's world is still
infested with some of the world's greatest gangsters; with
politicians of the lowest order; with white slavers holding
virtue of no value—a commodity to barter with; dope peddlers
destroying the bodies and Souls of children.
As a Master race he has not justly dealt with these outlaws
of his race. He is not proud of them. He does not hide the fact
that they are of the white race. He is aware of the fact that he

old, some of them at one time or another having a culture
almost beyond compare, but long since fallen into Spiritual
decadence, are now in absolute control over millions, and claim
the right to all power and dominance. Where is there a sign
of justice to even their own people; their glory, morality, kind-
ness, generosity, benevolence,-all that makes of men, MEN?
All that remains, judging by their acts, is murder, rapine,
degradation, brutality by the stronger over the weaker; a
recurrence to the worst features of inhumanity.
If the Jews throughout the centuries had the right, or
took to themselves the privilege without objection, of claiming
to be "God's chosen people," but have failed to prove their
inheritance, does not the white man, the Aryan, the Caucasian,
have the same right to claim that his is the Master race? What
has the white man done to prove it? He has progressed farther
than all other nations in inventive ability, making the lot of
all men, easier. He has manifested a universal generosity un-
known to the rest of the races. His culture was slow in the
process of overcoming his lesser tendencies. In a few hundred
years he has accomplished more than all other races put to-
gether. There is a debit side: the white man's world is still
infested with some of the world's greatest gangsters; with
politicians of the lowest order; with white slavers holding
virtue of no value-a commodity to barter with; dope peddlers
destroying the bodies and Souls of children.
As a Master race he has not justly dealt with these outlaws
of his race. He is not proud of them. He does not hide the fact
that they are of the white race. He is aware of the fact that he

must "clean house" in his own race, speak out boldly, expose
them, placing on record the evils of which the degraded of his
own race are guilty.
"Sam Jones," a white skin, found guilty as a cut throat
gangster; as a white slaver; as a narcotic peddler; as a kid-
napper; as a ward heeler, buying and selling free man's greatest
heritage—their votes. The white man must not hesitate to free
himself from these parasites by justly punishing the guilty of
his own race, ceasing to hide their guilt because they are of his
race.
It is humanities' competition. Claims no longer stand up
by themselves. All races must prove themselves; their honesty,
their morality, their kindliness, their generosity, their personal
responsibility, their ability to be self sufficient, and above all,
their willingness to place blame where blame belongs; to
call a "spade a spade"; to expose, condemn, and punish the
guilty, no matter who they may be. None should be granted
protection, or allowed to hide guilt, because of race.
The white race, with all its weaknesses, is willing and
anxious to rely on its inner convictions and on its achievements.
All it asks is to be left alone, and be permitted to help all the
other races who actually need help and would use it to good
advantage.
Only the red man among all men, does not constantly
brag about his race superiority. He asks only to be the free man
he was before he was made subject to superior strength, and to
be granted the rights and privileges God conferred upon him,
and which have always belonged to him and still belong to him.
Many of us believe, and our number is rapidly increasing,
that in America the white man's greatest crime has been, and
CONTINUES TO BE, HIS TREATMENT OF THE INDIANS WITHIN
His OWN country. America has billions to freely give to
decadent nations who actually have no call on us, while many

of its native children live in want, destitution and undescribable
conditions.
This is gross, almost unbelievable injustice, and must be
corrected to save the nation's honor. We, the people, cannot
blame the Government, or our Legislators. It is we who are
GUILTY, BECAUSE WE DO NOT DEMAND THE JUSTICE FOR
OTHERS, THAT WE DEMAND FOR OURSELVES.
The white man generally is Christian by profession. He
believes or professes to believe, in Biblical teachings. He accepts,
or claims to accept the fiat: "By the sweat of thy brow. . . ."
Only that which he has labored for and earned is rightly his.
Seriously, has the white man dealt justly with the
Indian? With the exception of a few instances, did
he exchange something of equal value for the
things he took unto himself? Has the white man
given the Indian freedom of choice of movement?
Has he exchanged land as desirable as that which he
took by force from the indians? Has he built schools
equal to his own for the indian's children? Has he
GIVEN THEM THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CULTURE? In short,
has the white man given the Indian whose lands he confiscated,
an adequate exchange and opportunity equal to that which he
is so freely giving the Negro? Have we, the white man, given
even a semblance of justice?
If there is a God, and we believe there is, if there is an
operating Law of justice, if there is a law of retribution:
"As ye sow, so shall ye reap," might it not just be that any mis-
fortune, any REaction the white race is confronted with, is in
just retribution of the Law we have so long and so completely
ignored?
Let us be just to all people, but to be overly generous to
one class and utterly unjust to another, will not even the score
under the Divine Law.

as a result of selectivity.13 The very beginning of man, of Bibli-
cal history, starts out with discrimination, or selectivity. God's
very first act with members of the first family was a choice
between Cain and Abel. In this story there is not the slightest
indication of the doctrine of equality except as -a result of
attainment. These two men, first of a new race, began the his-
tory of manifestation of the absolute, unvarying law of
equal opportunity for all men; but no equality unless they
made themselves so. The choice was theirs.
A sheet tabulating (author unknown) the Supreme
Being's discrimination or selectivity from among His children,
was mailed to us by a questioner, and we here reproduce it that
it may be an incentive to research by all interested.
"God discriminated when He called Abraham and
made covenant with him, and again when He confirmed
that covenant with Abraham's son Isaac, and grandson
Jacob. Gen. 12:1-3, 26:3,4 and 28:3,4.
"God discriminated when He selected the offspring
of Jacob-Israel to become a kingdom of priests and a holy
nation. Ex. 19:6.
"God discriminated when He gave His perfect law to
Israel, and to no other peoples or nations. Psalm
147; 19, 20.
"God was discriminating when He ordained that the
Israel people should become the 'sons of the Living God'
or Christians. Hosea 1:10, Rom. 8:39.
"God used discrimination when He said that His
people should make no covenant with the Canaanites, and
that they should not intermarry with them. Deut. 7:2.
13 Discrimination is actually in forcing men to do, or accept
things which in themselves might not be urrong, by edicts or
legislative enactments. This was the law before the days of the
Magna Charta and is once again raising its ugly head.
