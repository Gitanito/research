  		              		Experience Description   

      I had a heart attack when I was 19 years old.   

  I heard bells and someone was singing in the Sydney Opera that day.  

  They asked me if I wanted a family because that would change my life. I told them that I wanted a family and I love my children dearly since this experience. 

    I received knowledge.  I flew in outer space, until I reached Jupiter. I was expanded and I was huge. My guides told me how planets were formed.  Everything was discussed with me.    

    I was sent back to my body. I came back crying, I had to take on a difficult life.
