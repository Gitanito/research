  		              		Experience Description   

    I can't express my excitement when I came across this website, since my experience I have searched for other accounts of near death experiences to see if I could find someone who has had the same as mine. From others that I have read about or heard of never matched mine, mostly those have been bright lights, tunnels and family members that have passed etc. Mine is so different that I feel quite alone in my experience. I guess a brief history is where I should start. 6 months after the birth of my second child in December of 2001, I became pregnant again. My partner at the time became furious about this and forced and threatened me to abort my pregnancy. I was heartbroken, and guilt ridden. I left him but was forced back by his threats. Months later I again became pregnant, and again was forced and threatened to abort my pregnancy, this would happen once more a year later. A year after that I had to have surgery for an ectopic pregnancy, the day after my surgery while I was in recovery he came in with our son and said goodbye. He took my son and left me. After this I took my eldest son from a previous relationship and we moved to NY to live with my father. For the next several years, I was in and out of court for my youngest son. During this time, I had been very weak, lost, and didn't know what to do. My back started to really bother me, I went to see a doctor for this and had to have surgery in February of 2014, it was during this that the doctors noticed on the images that I had several large masses in my uterus. I was told that once I healed to get it checked out.  In October of 2014, I went to see an OBGYN for the masses. By December, I was told that I needed a hysterectomy. I went in for surgery on December 10, 2014. I was told that there were complications due to the amount and size of some of the masses.  
  
  While in recovery, I became ill. I was not getting any better and the doctors noticed a hole in my bladder and an obstruction to my ureter tube. I was rushed to another hospital for emergency repair surgery which took 9 hours. Come to find out I did have a hole in my bladder and my ureter tube had been stitched closed, but also my bladder had been sewn to the wall of my vagina and to the wall of rectum and two foreign objects were removed from me. It was during this massive repair operation that my experience occurred. 

  The earliest part of my experience started from pure blackness and peace. Shortly after the darkness, I appeared into this place.  Everything about it was alive and breathing; the walls, the floor, everything. There were these amazing bright lights everywhere within the walls and floor that moved with the breathing of this place. I stood in the middle, watching these bright white beings enter and exit the archways.  I was surrounded by archways in this huge dome that I could not even see the top of. 

  I was approached by three blue beings.  They were pure love and had no features or sexual identity.  They were just this vivid blue human-like form. As they approached me, two of them stopped a few feet away as the other continued toward me. This being used no verbal words, nor a human language to communicate with me.  It was more like frequency sounds and colors.  This being came to my right side and put its hand on my shoulder. With its other arm, it motioned me to look around me. As I looked, I was told this is the place of the souls birth and departure. I watched as souls came and went in and out of these archways that spanned beyond my vision. I was shown by the beings all my lifetimes, my soul's purpose, and saw and knew that I had been here and through these archways many times.  It felt like home to me. 

  I was told by the being that I would return to my body to complete my life, that I had work to do still. I was shown an archway and was told to follow the white being that was about to go through it.  In an instant, I was at the archway.  

  The next instant, I had awoken in the operation room. The first thing I said was 'Put me back!' I'm sure the doctors had no idea what I was talking about. 

While in recovery, I was visited by spirits. One was a little boy named Kenny who was trying to show me where his body was.  Another was an African American man who sat by me, read the paper, and told me about the deals on lawn mowers.  The other was a nurse that was running around throwing candy everywhere. I know this all sounds so crazy but it happened. I think of this experience every day. I feel it and can recall in detail everything and every moment of it. It has been such a profound thing for me. Since this, the weird things that I've always experienced have become much more prominent. I've always been weird in the sense of seeing, hearing, or feeling things.  But since this experience, I see colors in sounds. I feel frequency changes and have dreams that come true. This whole experience has left me feeling completely alone; in the sense that I can't find anyone who has had anything close to my experience.
