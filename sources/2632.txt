I am going to t-alk to you on your
Hi gher Self' , the subtle bodies of man and
ho w they may influence your life. · There
never v1as a truer sayin g t han t ho t, "Man
is f ea rfully and wonderful ly made.I! That .
applied not only to the phys ic s.l body of
man but to his high er natur e, his spir-
it uai , a stral and mental natur es , as
well as the_ physica l body j_n w1
,:i ch those
higher natures manifest.

hcn I ·spe~k of the e go , pcr~onality
or Sel·f, you wil-;L have p.cit cd that · I spoke
of it as somet h ing separate and apart

and that it is a law end f a ct of n a ture
that each kin,gdom is evo lvi ng into a

You may say we ha ve no exa mpl e s of

pressed into real . dens1ty it could be
compressed into an object not more than

nnd t here would still be a lot 6f space
bet ween the atoms and molecules. There
are spaces through our body as vast in
comparison as the dist anc e a that the
astrono~ers say separate the earth from
the sun. Those planes and t l:J
.ose spaces
are not empty. Relntive ·to our physical
body~ but vibrating bet ween the spaces
that form the mass of our bodv are other
pl anes of consciousness. ·The astr al
pl ane, the so-called; Fourth Dimension
is one of those planes. It hf1

it is as -actual, as real as this material
world in which we - stand. M

There is one peculi arity of the
astral state, tha ·t gives us some key as
to ~hat man was in the v ery ~eginning.
On -the a str al plane our thou gh t po wer is
considerably differ en t from what it is
in tha · mBteri a l world. In the astral
plane when you think of a t h ingJ' it is .•
Whatever · youthink manifests. Therefore,
when man .passes · to the astral plane, the
first thing he does is look at himself
to see what he looks like and if he is
all th ere and when he looks to see him-
self, he sees a replici of his physical

The ancient wi sdom t ea ch in gs tell
us t ha t th e .n ex t st.ep in nwn I s .conscious-
ne ss is elimin ation of t h nt astral bodv
becr.1µ;;0 only th en. can he be ,· enugh t up
into -the ·-Third Heaven spoken of, wh~re
Pau l says, 01 knew a man ab ove fourteen
years ag o - whether · in t h e body, -I know
not; or the spirit, I know- not; who was
cau ght up into th e Third Heaven and t l-:

bein g in the spirit" that -
' Paul spGke of
was·distinc t : from being i n t~ e -body and
ye t, a·f ter f our teen years, he could _-
not
recall whether he had met,the man in the
bod y or spirit, Tha t is, th e state of
con s c i ousness v!he re he has asccncl ed above
and b eyond '!:-
he mat erial world. That is
the Edenic st,ate · of man .
~e know tha t t he Christian Bible,
in the Book of Gene2 i s tells us that in
the be ginnin g man · did not h av e to · t oi l:,
to la bor, to ear n ·h is br ead, that he
l.i ·.red in the Garden of Eden, and tha t the
Di vine ?ower of God brou gh t t o h im all
t hjn g s that· we re necessary fo~ b~s well-
being. It tells us that Adam created
all thin gs by the llebe li~ wh i ch is a Heb-
..-19-
rew word meaning Divine Breath or D·ivine
Creative Breath. That is, the Breath of
God wh ich was breathed i.l'.lto man so he ·he-
came a living soul. That Edenic state of
man is merely a symbol of the primal state
of -manifestation of soul where it had
oreative power .,where it was able to create
by its thought, exactly as the soul who
is freed from bon d a ge and rises into the
higher planes, is able to create today.
The occul ti st says that man , ·w
hen
he ,first came into manifestation, came
in the body spiritual, that he had crea-
tive power, but that . aft er man fell and
lost that creative p·ower, tne· _opir i tual
man passed into the higber plane and the
lesser self entered 'into the animal body
\~thich had evolved up .: to the form of man
from the low er forms .of the animal king -
dom • . That is, 'that the ego or soul did
not enter the bcdy of man until it had
.become man. The soul followed one line
of evolution 'while the body follo wed
anoth e r and it v:as only after the animal
body };:tad b e come man that the hvo went on
together.
When we realize t h at man is more
than just fle-sh, that th ere i8 a Divine
dir e cting and guiding:influence and force
within him and t ha t that force infJ..uencos
all the a cti ons of his lif e~ th en it be -
comes a n ecessary part · of our actu al liv-

shall li ve , what we shall do in the vvorld.
People say ,"How can I find my High -

Self?" One way you dan do it is to pre-
pare the mind and body as a receptacle
