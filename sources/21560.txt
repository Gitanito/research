W riting a century after the time o f Caesa。 Pomponius M ela,
geographer, d "crib es 化e G auls as a spleen& l and superstitious race, a
people savage and dangerous to the last degree, since they considered
that 出eir gods could be best placated w ith m ortal blood. There
existed am ong them secret societies w ho w ere instructed b y the D niids
in occult lo re; they were observers o f the hosts o f heaven, and from
the trail o f a swi行 vagrom com et or the bla玄
e o f a 位lling star they
revealed to the jjeople the im placable and relentless w ill o f their dark
deities. These wizard masters claim ed as their disciples the scions o f
the nobl巧t hou化s; they toi*e youne and likely lads from their homes
to 化ain them in every hidden a rt; & e ir schools were the solitary caves
o f the cold pathless mountains or the darkest depths o f fearfully
haunted woods. T he same writer tells o f the m aiden priestesses, nine
in number, who dwelt upon the lo打
e Isle o f Sein am id the surges o f
the Atlantic, o ff the coast o f Brittany, w eird women w ho were believed
to have the power o f raising storms at sea and o f lulling the waves to
rest again by their po化nt charm s; nay, more, who could transform
themselves into the shape o f any beast or bird o f prey, who could send
pestilence and famine, or i f they w ould could heal any manner o f dis­
ease even such as leechcraft might not touch, who knew the future
and could 化U it.
It was at the comme打
cement o f the fifth century that the Franks began
to occupy G aul, and in the cou巧c o f not a great m any years the ancient
Frankish legislation, the Salic Law , was reduced to a written form, to
be finally sanctioned under K in g Clovis, who ruled from 4 8 1-511.
T hat secret ri化s and w kchcra打 were 技r from uncommon is am ply
evidenced by the provisions o f this venerable code. A t first heavy fines
were inflic化d. Seventy-two sous and H aifa golden coi打was the penalty
川 |
for 拉shioning that charm o f bale, the dreaded w itch，s k n o t; any who
accused his 打
eigiibour o f sorcery yet was un互

e, one hundred and eighty-
seven sous, was imposed for de位m ing any wom an as a witch unless
clearest ^roof o f her iniquities were forthcom ing; whilst i f any witch
was con vicbd o f having ftastied upon the flesh o f children, the enormous
sum o f two hundred sous was levied.
T he code o f the Visigoths pre化ribed yet s化m er measures. The
warlock who kad 心lied 江
ny person by his spells and i凸
ca打记tions was
to be punished w ith d eath ; i f he had harmed goods or the crops in
the fidds, but it could 打
ot be shown that he had taken li拓， his mis­
deeds w 灯e rewarded with scourging and ser妇om. Such was the fa化
o f **workcrs o f evil and those who raised tempests, those w ho are said
to destroy the vines or harvest b y their incantations, those who by the
invocation o f devils trouble their neighbours or who sacrifice at night
to the Dem on whom in their wickedn巧s they caU upon w ith impious
prayers."
Ecclesiastical authority now took up the m atter. A t the beginnii^;
o f the sixth century the bishops complained that the south o f France
was in拓$巧d b y augu。 and diviners w ho exercised such an untoward
influence over not m erely the peasants but men o f public position and
吟 w er 化 at in some districts & ere was hardly a person to be found，
rich or poor， m inded to engage upo凸 an y serious undertaking with­
out having previously consulted these charlatans and w on e than
charlatans, w ho not only emptied the purses o f their dupes but made
their lives m iserable w ith their lying prophecies and predictions. The
bishops ordered th at so far from resorting to these wretches, their
rather to denounce them to the local authorities^

抑 tchcraft, and accusations o f witchcraft, b说am e prominent in
connexion w ith the political gam e o f kings and queens. W hen in 578
Fredegonde lost one o f her sons, she prom ptly contrived that the

killed the young prince b y sorcery. It was alleged that h e had con-

he had been so m altreated that he survived only a few days, and k
was rumoured at the tim e that he was, in fact, incontinently assassinated

m aintained a pack o f fortune-tellers and w a r lo ^ , in pa^ticular 汪
wom an possessed b y a pythonicai spirit, in whcee p>owers she trusted
to secure her from the consequences o f her crimes. B y means o f these
& u l satellites she succeeded in terrorizing the kingdom until her death
in 597. H er great rival, Brunehaut, w as executied at 此e com m and o f
C lo ^ aire II in the year 613. She aJso was com m only reputed to be a
witch, and 化was said that 孟 e was especially skilled in the frigid charm
o f im potency known as nouer VaiffiHletU^ a device which was regarded
w i化 especial hoiTor and detestation， as being audaciously anS most
contumeliously opposed to the direct com m and o f the Creator.
Ghilperic III in 742 issued an appeal to the ecclesiastical authorities
to assist him in suppressing all Icmds o f divination; sacrifices to the
fien d ; hum an sacrifices w hich were still offered in dark com ers and
the remoter distrk色, where the H反 o f a slave counted for little; worship
o f the dead and necromancy, the confection o f poisons and unclean
love-amulets, w ith m any other dangerous crafts and conjurations.
U 口
der Cliarlem agnc the statutes becom e even more de巧
nite and
were more strictly enforced. A law was passed which prohibited in
most ab化lu化 化 rms any consul化tions w i沾 com m on fortune-tellers or
any inquiry from such fo比 as to the m eaning o f dreams or an y kind o f
peeling into the future; magicians, enchan化rs, tho化 who pretend to a
knowledge o f the years to come, those who feign to be able to evoke
rain or 化m p的位 or who claim that they can procure 位ir weather,
observers o f tim 的, scryers a打
d mediums, are threatened w ith the
closest imprisonment until it can be shown that they have w holly
turned from their wicked ways. A n y places such as a grove, a Druid
dolmen, a pagan w ell, where it is repu巧d that wUches hold their
rendezvous are to be utterly demolished and burned with fire.
W hen this code was first promulgated with i拉 provision allow ing fbr

beloved by his subjects 拓r his gentlen巧5 and sweet 化mper, soon fcTt
no little alarm at the continual reports which reached him . M ore­
over, a Council o f Paris in 829 addressed a very solemn appeal to the
sovereign to 扣sist by the secular arm H oly Church i凸 the crusade
against witchcraft, and it has been w ell said b y D e Cauzons that in

very im portant and significant that the time has now been reached
when these texts arc legally quoted not to justify but to enforce the
execution o f witches. It m ay be rem arked tliat a certain suspicion or
vein o f treason was always c o n sid a e d to b e c o m m in g le d w ith w k ch -
, since the person had transformed his allegiance from the lawful
sovereign, the Prince o f the land, to an alien, the devil. This idea was
afterwarcb elaborated in fuller detail b y the jurists, and an even darker
shade was given to it when the w itch was held to be guUty o f
majesty， a fklse traitor to A lm ighty G od.
T h e legislation o f Charles le Chauve, who died in 877, is as drastic
and as preg打
ant in its im port as a凸
y pandect o f A esixteen th orseven -
化enth ceiuuhes. It is noticeable 化o that the code enac拉that offenders
i凸this kind are to be sought out a打
d arrested. It is no longer a ques­
tion o f unshamed and notorious w izardry, but those 化 whom any
overt suspicion attaches are to be brought to triaJ. **If they be found
guilty, whether m en or whether women, let them die the death as
law and justice dem and. A n d not only the principals in this abomina­
tion, but also those w ho consort w ith or consult 化em, shall pay the
penalty in order that the very m em ory o f so heinous a crim e m ay be
utterly abolished and uprootod from our land.**
T he effect o f these measures was to drive the evil underground. T h e
ni打
th and tienth centuries for France uneasy and most wre化hc<i
years, a dark era o f invasions, o f civil wars, o f revolting provinces, and
the thousand bitter woes such disturbances bring in their train. It was
largely a period o f chaos and anarchy, since the princes for the most
part were too m uch occupied in m aintaining their position b y fbrcc o f
arms to apply the law in its 化U rigou。 Occasional prosecutions are
recorded, such as that at Orleans under Robert Ic Pieux in 1022, o f
the Cathari, a not uimumerous society o f devil-worshippers, and con­
tem porary chroniclers record m any a history o f possession and hideous
sortilege when 化 c pow c。 o f evil were exalted.
A ctually the official records are few, but so soon as a m ore general
order is restored w e find that amongst the checking o f other crimes and
abuses, this evil also, w hich owing to the sad accidents o f the state had
jucuciai inquiries are recoraea. It IS true

t aris坊 w hether the invoca­
tion o f demons is not 斬 " heretical, and the great authority Sylvester
MazzoUm decides that such indeed must be the case, that all witches
are, in fkct, heretics, m aterial or form al. Bernardo 出 Com o in his
价w /n胖站forum， under the title "D aem ones Inuocare," discu巧es
"Daem ones Inuocare an sit haereticum ,，， and allows that there are
two probable opinions either o f which m ay be followed. It is necessary
仍 make some very carefbl and nice distinctions here, but 仿r m y part
I sub化ribe to Lapus, w ho says, "Im iocans daemones est haere扫
cus,
cum attr化uat eis id quod esc D ei, per quem om nia facta sunt." A t
the 巧me time it is on y 拉ir to add that one mu巧 distinguish, and in
1473 the Carm elit的 o f Bologna held that it was not necessarily always
heretical, and Ugolini Zanghino, in his Tractatus de Haereticis^ xxii,
wrkes that there arc certain operations o f m agic w hich do 打
ot involve
the malice o f heresy. O n the other hand, as Bernardo di Com o lays
dow n: "Im plorarc auxilium a daemone in his quae sunt supra fectd-
拉化m humanam, sicut in uaticinatione de futuro, et in aliis operibus
m agicis,in quibuscom pIem en tum operisexuirtutedaem on um expec-
tatur, est apostasia a fide, per pactum initum cum daemone, uel
uerbo化nus si inuocatio intersit, uel facto aliquo, etiam si sacrificia
d货int.’’
Incidentally it m ay be remembered that charges o f sorcery o打
en
resolved themselves into charges o f murder, for the wkches o f all
countries were adepts in the art o f poisoning, and in such cases the
offences were tried before the civil courts. Thus one o f the accusations
against Bernard Delicieux was that he had attem pted the life o f
^ n e d ict X I by m agic arts; and in 1308 the Sire d*Ulmet was brought
to Pa^s upon a charge o f attem pting to kill his wife by sorcery, whilst
tlie hags whom he had employed w ere buried alive or burned at the

T ypical cases w hich c：am e before the Inquisition were such as that o f
AngM c .de la Bathe in 1。
75, w ho confessed she habitually copulated
to w hom she had bom e a monstrous child; and m 1459
that o f a mysterious herm it, Robinet de V au lx, which latter
gave rise to the prosecutions at Arras, impHcadng a lai^e
o f persons, o f nobles and w ealthy butchers as w ell as common folk.
Although G regory X I in 1374 au th o ri2 ^ the Inquisition to prosecute
all cases o f sorcery,出 e loc。 farlem ents gradually weaned th k offence
from ecclesiastic占 juris出ction. In 巧 9 〇 a secular o巧cial by
— name
Poulallier, Prevost M arshal o f the district, arrested several sorcerers
at Laon, and Bodin, De la Dhaanamamt Sorciers, IV , i, says that
thereaiier cognizance o f these offenc坊 was confined to the secular
tribunals. **Mais depuis la cognoissance fust attribuee aux lugez laiz,
priuatiuem oit aux gens d*£glise par arrest du mesme Parlem ent Tan
m。 trois cens nonan巧， qui 扣1 sainctement ordonn《 ." Accordingly,
although JeaneUe N euve was tried and sent to the stake b y the court
o f the A bbey o f Saint-ChafTre, this was in its capacity as haut-justidert
and not as an ecclesiastical tribunal. M oreover, poisoning was laid to
her charge, for 击 6 Wre 如 Burzet, having 拉l!en out with bis wife and
wishing to be reconciled, applied to Jeanette for a potion. She gave
him some mys化rious drug, which was secre过
y administered in a cup
o f wine to the lady, w ho within a very few horns was dead.
It m ay be noted that o f the great writers upon demonologjy, four at
least, Jean Bodin, Nicolas 民em y, H enri Boguet and Pierre de Lancre,
were secuilar m agktrates and preddents o f secular courts.
Sup化m ely in化resting and o f the first importance as they are: but
bare mention, must be m ade o f the three great cases o f the Knights
Tem plars, S. Joan o f A rc, and Gilles de R ^ .
It has been said that the begum ing o f the fourteenth century
all Chris化ndom, from G reat Britain to Cyprus, was convulsed b y liie
tragic catastrophe o f the Knights Tem plars, th w which history Imows
no more form idable trial, nor has the final verdict been given even
to-day.** T h e exact source whence proceeded the immediate denuncia-
tic打 o f the Tem plars is uncertain. I t m ay certainly be allowed that
Philip L e Bel regarded w ith jealous suspicion the strongholds that the

Templars had buih Up and down 出roughout France; it h inco凸
tesb
able that he not only coveted but (eared the vast riches o f the O rder.
Y et it is difHcuh to think that he did not credit at least some o f the
charges which were brought against the O i^ cr, for it is clear that
m any o f these were substantially es化Wished. N o doubt extravagant
stories were bruited and believed in m any quarters^ the episode w ould
be unique in human his化ry were it 打
ot so. M any m em be巧 protested
their entire i凸
nocence, and it is not to be supposed that 山c more
occult mysteries and inner secrets o f Baphomet» the osculum obscoenum
and 化e Gnostic li化rgy were revealed to any save to the most trusted
initiates.
Even in this long 巧ri的 o f trials, w hich in various countries o f
Europe and 化 roughout 化 e cities a打

the procee出巧;s o f tw o separate

拓r the ecclesiastical arm, was m erely an agent o f the English, and
even if 化 e tribunal befbre which she was brou班 t had acquitted her
油e would yet have remained 化 e prisoner o f 化 e K in g o f 技igUmd. It
was in 1449 that Charles V I I opened the process for the revision o f this
irregular trial， and Pope C a li^ ^ i n appointed a commission o f 化 e
highest a打
d most rev灯end prelates to investigate the m atter. T h e
A ^hbishop o f 民heims, the Bishop o f Paris, the Bishop o f Goutances

化 e sentence, so that the whole trial was quashed 泌 a manifest error
both in right and in justice, proceedings w hich were perfidious and
defamed, false and in ^ gn , a peijured process full o f manifest contra-

I V ， This
)f course, greatly exaggerated, and cases could be quoted during the
lundred years m entioned b y M ichelet, and in the reigns o f these three
kings, that is to say, from 1483 to 1547. Thus on 3 ic 9th October,
1519, Catherine Peyretonne was executed at M ontpezat. She con­
fessed to habitual attendance at the Sabbat, and for many years she
had stolen infants from the cradle, sacrificing them to her familiar,
and adoring the fiend with obscene ritual. In 1521 at
shepherd, lycanthropes, M ichel Verdun and Pierre
Bu巧oi， burned alive. U nder Francois I 化ere were 化rrible
scandals at the convent o f St. Pierre at Lyons, which was convulsed by
an outbreak o f dem oniacal pc^cssion. There was an exec山ion in
1539, and again in 1540 a t Toulouse. In the same year the Norman
Parliament Gumed in 化 6 old market-pla说 at Rouen two shepherds o f
Tosny, a ham let nesu- G ison, b y name Delarue and M orin, obstinate
and sd^confessed Satanists o f long continuance.
true that under such a king as Frangois I, whose pose was to
be the baroque Am adis o f raonarchs; w ho was fantastic and fickle in
his showy ch ivalry; as variable as he was VC口atile; whose ideal was the
useless m agnificence o f the Field o f the Cloth o f G o ld ; whose nature
was at the bottom profoundly indifferent; w ho took love and devotion
but who gave not even gratitude; under such a king as this k is true
that it was not to be expected the laws would receive any impetus or
weight. Privately, both he and his mother were incredibly lax and
frivolous as regards their views upon religion, but at the same time
officially they recognised that the Catholic Church was o f immense
impOTtance and had a great 化mporal authori巧. T h e brutal bias*
phemies o f the i8th and 19th O ctober, 1534, when H oly Mass was
reviled and the venerated statue o f O u r L ady m utilated, were rightly
avenged with the gibbet and the stake.
A very 出fferent charac化r was Henri, this second son, who upon
the death o f the young dauphin Francois becam e heir to the th ro n t
**I1 est Satumien,** was the clever m ot o f Simon R enard; and a
Venetian ambassador w ro h : "H e is melancholy, saying litlie, and
devoid o f repartee; but when once he has said a ^ in g he holds to it
for he is very c k a r and decided as to his opinions." "H e is
brave, and loves hunting and fighting; and he is very religious, and
w ill not ride on Sundays.** So judged M atteo Dandoio. And one o f
the opinioDS to which this very rdigious young king held in his decided
w ay was that France must be cleared o f the witches and devil-wor­
shippers who were recruiting their ranks from every quarter, to the great

and wal:chful as a Spanish grandee, there 巧ood not his w i托, the
Florentine Catherine de* M edici, **the shopkeeper*s daughter** as they
cruelly dubbed her, but a lady o f exquisite beauty, la grande Seneschale.
Henri was eiglueen years old when he fell under the enchantment o f
Diane de Poitiers, and when he died twenty-three years later he was
no le拍 devoted. Pale, tall and slender, she was ever soberly clad, for
at the time Henri first became her lover she wore quiet weeds for her
husband, and in knightly wise he also adopted for his badge the silver
and black his lady favoured, emblazoni打
g everywh灯e her device, a
crescent moon with the motto Donee totum impleat orbem, Diane was all
reserve and mys化ry; irUensely religious and jealous o f the honour o f
her faith, she looked with proudly i打
tolerant ey巧 upon the scandals
wrought by sorcery and witchcraft throughout the fair realm o f France.
This great lady，who, as she said, "w ould not fbr an empire have
spoken to a H uguenot," did not suffer the law to sleep. **Le sombre

means to have continually in her retinue 注num ber o f occultists, some

herself was not infrequently present at unhallowed rites, but very
化cretly for fear not so much o f the king, as o f the om nipotent Duchesse

dnois. Certainly Catherine had consulted her astrologers on
the eve o f the 29th June, 1559, for early that morning she 化nt urgent
messages to Henri be煤 ing him not to ven化re 化 化 e jousts. H er
warnings were laughed at, and, as 技化 willed and the Huguenots
planned, the lance o f M on巧omeri lodged a splin化r ;n the royal brain.

which so often accompanies an irregular mysticism and uneasy curiosity
concerning the 扣扣re, she did not in any w ay at化m pt to relax the
common law nor did she shelter the sm aller fry. Indeed throughout
the reigns o f her three sons, Francois II, 1559-1560; Charles IX , 1560-
1574; and H enri III, 1574-1589, the w itch prosecutions were pursued
with the utmost energy and vigour. N ot indeed that they in any w ay
relaxed w h ikt H enri I V and Couis X i n occupied the throne; whilst
even under Louis X I V there w ere some terrible cases o f Satanism in
the provinces, and in Paris itself occurred the resounding scandals o f
la Voisin and her vile associate.
O f the Valois, Charles I X and H enri III w ere m ore than suspected

化r 化 e evidence which has come down 化 us is m w t violently prejudiced
and inim ical, but whatever m ay b« the truth o f the matter, it is lairly
w ell established that the assassination o f this monarch o凸 ISt August,
1^89, was largely the result o f reports which were most industriously
circulated by the Leaguers, openly accusing him o f sorcery. Early in
1589 was published a pam phlet entitled 沁化巧巧么

exceedingly preci化 in its details. Even more 拉ntastic stories o f 化hook

Nicolas R em y was born in 1530 at Charm es, o f which town his
拉ther, an honoured and active magistra化, was m ayor. Destined from
his earliest yea口 to the legal pro拓ssion, since at this tim e Lorraine did
not yet boast a University， he pursued his 8tu出es in France, probably
at Orleans. H e proceeded to the degree o f Licentia化 in Laws, and for
one-and-twenty years occupied the chairs both o f Laws and Literature
in more than one ancient college. In lette扣 patent which were granted

as a judge had little leisure &om his avocation. M oreover, the very

From 1576 to Rem y was not the least active member o f this
distin邑
uished body, fv e r y case and process o f sorcery in Lo打aine came
under his notice for examination. Even those which he himseli* did 打
ot
judge in person were submitted to him by the amplest sworn reports.
It was owing to his zeal in this function that he obtained the title
'‘化ourge o f wi防hes," and on 9 April, 1583, Charles III raised him to
noble rank as a recognition o f the tireless services he had rendered the
State. T he lette内 patent say: "E n chacune de ces charges il se 巧rail
comporte avec tel acquit et satisfaction de son devoir que nous en
aurions toujours regu bon contentement." O n i August, 1589, Rem y
on account o f his extraordinary legal knowledge and immense erudition
was honoured with the title o f Councillor of the Privy Cou打
cil o f Lor-
raine. T he Duke now entrusted him with various commissions o f the
first importance, and on 24 A u g u s t,巧91, when 反emy was sixty-one
years old he was named in succession to George M aim bourg Procureur-
General o f 化e D uchy o f L o rra in e,化at is 化 say. Lord ftigh Justi说
with supreme power and jurisdiction. Arm ed with complete control
over all the courts throughout the duchy, not only did he encourage
the magistra化s to exerci化 the utmost vigilance i凸the pursuit, and tile
most unrelenting severity in the condemnation o f witches, but, par­
ticularly during the year 1596, he him selfjourneyed up and down the
jrovince, exam ining suspects, searching out even the most remote vil-
ages and hamlets, and inquiring into all cases with the most indefatig­
able energy and perseverance. R em y filled the high office o f Procurer-
General from 1591 to 1606.
During the few intervals o f leisure his duties allowed he was wont
to retire to his country-house at Saint-M ard, near Bayon, where he
deUglned 化 化 rn to K化r a ^ studies, 饥 j 化 娜 and woo the Muse
both in French and in Latin. During term-time he lived at Nancy in a
house in the Rue du Haut-Bourgeois, as appears from a list o f the house­
holders o f N ancy drawn up in 1589, and preserved in the library o f that
to w n .民em y was married, by some it is said to an Italian lady, and he
was the father o f a numerous 扫m ily, o f whom his three sons, Claude,
Emmanuel, and Scipione were especially distinguished. O n 3 June,
1598, a son o f Nicolas Rem y, who was then sixty-eight years old, was
baptized at the parish church o f Notre-Dame de Nancy, as appears
from the regis化rs o f that da化. It were superfluous to recount in detail
化e honours which were heaped upon him by his sove巧ign and his

In fine, before the reign o f Charles III in Lorraine no body o f
had been written down and there was no reliable appeal to pre­
cedent. M . R em y, in this work, which is composed in French, quotes
la巧 e num b灯 o f passages from G reek and Latin au化ors, and it is
embellished, as is usual with his pages, with the ample fruits o f his
w ide learning and most elegant erudition.
T he praise o f so great a scholar as Calm et means much, and it
were superfluous to emphasize his encomium o f the admirable 民emy.
W e have briefly reviewed the events, the continuance and increase o f
化c abom inable society o f witches, wWch led up to and necessita化d his
crusade in Lorraine at the end o f the six化enth century. N o his化rical
record could be more valuable， no record could be more 玉
nter仿ting
than this graphic account compiled from firsthand knowledge and the
experience o f m any years which R cm y has given us. T h at it is in
every, essential true i see no reason to doubt. Dom C a lm d in his
Ifistoire £ccksiastique el CiifiU 瓜 Lorraine, livre 'xxxiii (folio, N utky，
1728), w rites: **Comment de persuader qu*une infinite de Procedures

T h at 民emy should have stamped out the evil was, humanly
speaking, impossible, but he certainly SCO化 hed it. H ad it not been
for hU efforts a打
d the effewts o f 0出er great and brave men, his con­
temporaries, it is difficult to say to what a height 化is plague o f evil
might not have grown. As it was there were terrible scandals during
■ H

化e first h alf o f the seven化cnth cenUiry, but it was the work and the
writing o f 民emy, Boguet, Bo出n, D e Lancre and o化ers which enabled
the authorities to deal drastically with 化e sorcerer and 化e Sa化nist.
It is unnece站ary to do more than refer to the cas巧 o f Louis Gaufridi
in i 6 n ; o f U r b a i n G randier in 1617; o f M adeleine Bavent in 1647;
and the terrible sea打
dais which convulsed Pads in i 679~82. A ctu 立ly
the last execution in France for whchcraft 化ems to have been that o f
a man who was condemned upon multiplied charges by the Parliam ent
o f Bordeaux in 1718.
T he prosecution, it is true, gradually ceased, but the devH-wor-
shippers, albeit more secretly, continued their vile cult, and examples
o f their activities might be g i v e n t h r o u g h o u t t h e w h o l e o f t h e m n e -
化enth century. T o mention but three o f even later da化, the horrible
events which took place in February 1922, in 1924, and again at
Bordeaux in January, 1926, the Mesmin scandals, assuredly called for
thejudgem ent o f a R cm y or a D e Lancre. O n Tuesday, 24th Septem ber,
1929, trie Daily Express published an article upon the **Rcvival o f
Sorcery in France.** M aitre M aurice Garcon, a leading French
barns 化r, declared that scarcely a w e注 passes but some case o f witch-
craft comes up in one part o f country or another. This gentlem an
has made a special 8化d y o f the suTviv^ o f sorcery， w itchcraft and
Black Mass的 in France, and has appeared in court in m any cases
involving these dark practices. H e has actually exam ined the pacts
written and signed in blood, composed w ith every circum stance o f
legal p h raseo l(^ , b y w hich some wretches assign their souls to the
devil in return fbr m a化rial beneGts, power，
m oney, or 化e gratification
o f their base lusts.
N or must it be supposed that France is singular in this respect.
The same horrid contrac技 are m ade in England to>day as w ere si沪 ed
and sealed by A lice K yteler, by Dem d化e and Julian C o x ; b y Pierre
Aupetit, b y Bouile, b y Grandier, by l*abb6 Guibourg. W itdicraft is
practised in secret and almost overtly. Y et there stands the law divine
which Nicolas 反emy inscribed upon the title-page o f his m ighty work
weU-nigh three and a half centunes ago: t/ir siae mtdier, in quilms

the rarer case for a sorcerer to be driven

The truth is 出at；, when Satan can­
not move a man by fair wo地 ，he
compels him by fear and 也托ats of
danger. When Claude Morfele, who
was convicted of witchcr泌 at Sene
(5th Dec., 1586), was asked what was
the chief inducement that had first

he answered 出at he had withsU)〇

at it IS
in vain that they at化mpt or seek to
wreak any vengeance against them.
See how God defends and pro化cts
the authorUy of those to whom He
has given 山e manda化 of His power
upon earth, and how He has there-
fore made 化cm partake巧 of His pre-
rogative and honour, calling them
Gods even as Himsdf (化 IxxxH): so
that without doubt they are sacro­
sanct and, by reason of their duty and
their office, invulnerable even to the
spells of witches. Indeed they arc not
even bound in the least by the com­
mands of the Demoni themselves,
even though they may have previously
vowed allegiance to them and have
been touched with the Slain of that
oath. For that wi化hes bcneBt by the

was there taken upon a charge of

the town in which part o f her body
she had been thus marked by the
Demon; upon which he decided to
test the truth of this alleged ;nsensi，

be thrust and deeply forced into the
place the presence of a sufficient
number of witnesses; and no drop of
blood ;ssued from the wound, and
the wi化h gave not the sKghtest sign
of any pain. A t Porrentruy (30th

was about to be put to the torture
and, as the CH

to light. Thereupon tne Judge, sus*
peeling the truth, namely^ that this

that the wound did not itieed in 化e

from a stone; but after she was
brought to the torture she not only
acknowledged 比at the mark had
been made by a Demon, but re-
cou.nted sevei^al other crud injuries
which 化e had received from him.

doubt that his purpose 化is that

piety from iheir hearts and show
themselves to God, who holds His

A S I was writing this there came
</\icuo my hands the sta化menu of
certain prisoners at Forpach (a town*

from which I learned 化r the first Ume
that when witches are about to fly
from their husbands， beds to their
assemblies, it is their practice, in order
to prevent their husbands from noting
an^ departure from their ordinary
daily and nightly habits^ to charm
them by their spells Snto a sleep from
which mey cannot ea3t!y be aroused;
or else to lay beside them as they are
buried in r叩 D

mitted that she had ofte打do凸

and that, to sink her husband in such
a sleep, she had many times tweaked
his ear after having with her right
hand anointed it with the same oint-*
ment which she used upon he口油

tuted in her place a child’s pillow, and
Sinchen May of Speircben some

they had often deceived their base­
bands. Maria, the wife of Johann

c supreme and endur，
X ing cause of offence, it is that which
arises from envy, which (as Cicero
ays) ;s by 拉r the b^Ucrest and most
abiding of all motives. And if this be
true o? mankind, what can we but
think its influence will be with Satan,
who has no greater care or anxiety
than to be ever seeking some fresh
calamity or misery wherewith to afflict
mankind) because their condition
life i$ to some degree more fortunate
than his own? It should not, then,
appear wo打
derful that once he has
gained power and authority over any
man, he should prove so hara a master
and ^cathimsocrueUyandunmcrci-
fuUy. It is, indeed, the perpe化al com，
plaint of such that he never fails to
invent reasons for imputing some fault
or contumacy to them, and for blam­
ing and severely punishing them; and
that never， even fbr a s5ngk moment，
docs he allow them any peace.
At Altwckr in January 1585, Kuno

Another time he paid a heavy penalty
becau化， without asking permission,
he had da巧d to restore to health the
daughter ofDominique 民ay, to whom，
at 在e Demon’s instigation, he had
given poison. But by far his most 化iri-
fying cxp^icncc was when the Demon
earned him through the air and set
him dow打over the river MoscUc ;n a
precipitousplace full of peril by reason
of the rapi击 ； and did not cease 广
threatening to cast him down

wards he was compiled, by the

that deed，
Jeanne Gcrardinc (at Villc-sur-
N^^)sdlc,June 巧的)， Catharine Ruffa
(at Pagn巧•sur-'Klo$eUe> N o v .巧84)，
and Fran^oisc Fellet affirmed that
they had ofte打 been punished for
their neglect of wrongdoing: and,
according to Nicole Morcle (at Serre,
January 巧87)， the punishment was
so severe & at h灯 breath was taken
away and she almost died. And she
added that this need 打
ot seem sur-
prisi打
g ; for the Demon had ha打
ds of
iron with which he so pounded their
heads that it seemed to 化ose who fdt
them that they had been deprived of
也 bones. Alex知 Belheure (助ain-
ville, Feb, 1587) and Claude Mordc
(at Scire, Dec- 1586) complained that
they had, to their great hurt, very
often experienced the like punUh-
ment. And sometimes he so flies in
their 拉cc with his 化Ions that he leaves
it all rent and tom; as Rosa Gerar-
dinc, of the Euval distrietj i打Novem­
ber 1586, made manifest to 化e Judge
by showing the scars which she yet
bore.
The Demon put every pressure upon
the same Bdheure to poiso打her hus，
band. But when, for love of him,, she
would not do this, he was infuriated
bv her refb巧1 a打
d affiic化d her with

化e dropsy; and she suffered from that
swelling for six whole months, and did
not recover until her feet were lanccd
and elgh巧en pints of the most stinking
matter were drawn off.
He did not cea巧化 urge M argaret
Luodman (Vereavillc, Jan. 1587) to
poison her neighbour's cow which had
ea化n aU her cabbages a打
d trodden
down aU her garde打； and gave her
some poison on a wooden platter for
that purpose. But she shrank from do­
ing It because she 化ared that her
n^ghbour, whom she knew to be a
very shrewd woman, would de化ct her
in the crime. At last, therefore, in
order to free herself of that obligation
and so that she might at any cost
appease her Little Master, she chose
rather to kill with the same poison the
one s化er which she had in her own
stable. Bcrtrande Barbier (Forpach,
Aug. 1587) was also compelled to pay
by the loss of her own cattle for spar-
i打
g those of another again巧 the com­
mand of her Little Maswr，
With the ut田ost importunacy the
Demo打drove ApoUonic (of Freissen，
A u g .巧87} to promise that she would
never rest until she had done some
great injury to the 位mily of h乞
r fellow-
townsman Eysart. But she was unable
to fulfil her promise; for she was pre*
vented by Cfod, ミ
打
to whose care a只
d
pro化ction Eysart used to entrust him*
self and hi3 Ikmily at the dawni打
g of
every day• At last she was drive打to
the necessity ofappeasing the Demon
v^ation at her failure to keep her
promise by the murder of her ten*
year-old daughter, whose name was
fcugcl. Another D^mon
same compulsio打to kill her
spring upon Catharine Praevote (in
rreissen, Sept. 1589). For she had
conceived a violent desire to poison
the only daughter of her neighbour
Michael Koch, and had many times
tried to do so, but without success;
fbr the chiW's fa化er kept her
from evU spells by means of daily
prayers and lustrations. A t Ia5t, as
the Demo打kept complaining that he

was bei打
g bau化ed of his prey, the
heartless mother did not 行

CO饥pensati打
g him over and above by

g her own Infant son, Odilo,
It is, in fact， an immutable law that,
if witches have failed i凸their at化mpt
to injure another, they must them*
selves become the victims of their in-
te打
ded m alke; for the Demon never
permits his d试igns to 化n for lack of
some object. And if several wi化hes
together have made an attempt, and
there is a question as to which of them
shall bear the brunt of their failure^
the matter is decided by lot, and she
upo打whom it 知 Is must pay the pen-
a ty 仿r them all. The same Praevo化
5狂化s that this course was o打
ce taken
by he口
d r and her associa化s in crime.
*中or，" she 化id, "wc had plotted 化-

or other we were thwarted 1打 our
attempt. Nevertheless, something had
to be achieved, so that by some means
he might be satisfied who was con­
fidently awaiting his prey. We de，
cided, therefore, to draw lots to deter­
mine which of U5 should suffer for it ；
and the lot fell U|^n Agnes Eyswi任，
the ev;lest and wickedest woman oi*

shrinking from the 么
【rodty ofthe deed，
with the greatest readiness and in the
presence of her CO扣panions gave a
poisoned d!*ink to her twenty-year-old
son, named Pe化r， in conseque打
ce of
which his wh〇
]e body was not long
afVer marveUously dis【
o"ed and dis­
figured." Without doubt she was con，
strained either to do this or else herself
su航 r an eve凸more painful death
at the hands of the Demon, who 凸
ever
condo打
es any failure.
In the same way Balial Basle of
Su Nicolas-dc*P〇
rt near Dombas c*
sur-Mcurthc, March 1587) did not
persist in hi3 contumacy with im*
punity. For because he neglected to
obey the Demon^s command to poison
a certain man whom he bitterly nated,
he su航 red such 化irible punishment in
his own hotue that (as he said) he
would rather die at once than have to be absolu
a^ain.
Neither did that MaiKanta^ whom
have just mentionea, escape the
vengeance cf the Demon for having

cries were heard a very long way off
by the Castellan's servants.
See how very harsh and unjust a

have surrendered themselves entirely
tohis will: whereas Qirist ever teaches
that His yoke is easy and His burden
light, and ui^es those who would have

It is, indeed, bu( meet that two
oppositesystems ofservice should

[ results. The supreme law
is love bom o f faith, and
: He gathered us into His church,
tias given us no more sacred com-
id than this；in S. John xiii. 34：
new commandment I give unU>
you, that ye love one another as I
kave loved you." Again, in verse 35;
"By this shrill all men know A at ye
are my disciples, if ye have love one
to another.*^ This commandment is
not hard to obey; it is full o f love, joy
and happiness. XocHf we fall short in
our obsavance of it, God does not at
once pour forth Hi$ wrath upon our
stubbornness， but is slow to punish
and loath 仿 chastise. And 江He must

envy, treachery, ouelty, slaughter,

he was a murderer, a calumniator,

tion, and report it rather more fully.
In May 1589 the inhabitants were
holding a carnival at LQtzcn, a not
inconsiderable town a c 【 he foot of the
Vosges. A man named Claude Gho*
teau was returning at ni^ht&ll from
there to a neighbouring^ village called
Wisembach^ and had climbed the bet-
te rp a rto fth ch illw h ich sta n d sb o
tween the two places^ when he was
suddenly pulled up by a violent whiH，
wind. He looked about in astonish，
ment and could see no reason 化r such
an unusual happenings for everywhere
else was p^ectly calm. Ti^en he
observed in a retir^ comer, locally
known as Mor^e^ six masked women
dancing around a table laid with
much gold and silver, teasing their
heads like mad women; and near them
was a man sitting upon a black bull
wa化hing them as 穿 he were some
casual passer-by. He stood sdU for a
little^ therefore, to collect bimself and
observe it all more closely; but they
Snstancly 出sappeared and vanished
from his sight. recovering from his
fright, he resumed hisjouraey and had

rent a man with a black face and
hands curved like hooks, with which
the horrid apparition would have rent
■ clawed his 色ce if he had not
drawn his sword and defended him-
self. But on his doing that, the man
ceased to threa化n him, and disap-
peared like o打
e in fear 化r his li吃.
(This supports the contentio打of Plato
and Pscllus and certain academic
philosophers that Demons are sw-
cepuble to and afraid of threa巧
, blows,
cuts and wounds. This matter we deal
v/ith elsewhere*) Nevertheless, those
wome打showed themselves again, and
with them the man who, as I said, was
sitting 打a buH and watching their
dance. To him Choteau, growing
bolder, went 巧 and sa id :寺

riardly ha(j he said 化U, when he
again caught up i打 a whirlwind or
cloud; and when he at last got free
from it he 化und himself alone on the
ground far away from the road; but
he found his way back to it and re*
turned home as quickly as he could*
Three days after givii^ evidence of
this he was again summoned before
the Judge and added to his former
statement the following: that he re­
membered that^ when he had gone
near to the table to see what sort of a
banquet was there set out, the D ^ o n
had immediately flown at hisface with
his claws; and that while he was de*
fending himselfwith his sword he had
been lifted up by a violent wind and
carried to the cataracts of Cennbri-
mons, not less than two hundred paces
away. And lest anyone should put this
story down to the ravings of a Sunken
man frightened by the loneliness o fthe
night and the place, Barbette Garot,
o打
e ofthosesix women, had the month
before told the 巧me 5化ry to theJudge
in almost the same words; adding that
ace
Desird Gaxet and his wife had gi
Cho化au two measures of com ^
two cheeses of cow*s milk as the pm
of his silence about what he had see:
And when he and she were brought
face to face, they agreed all respects
except only that Barbette said that the
reason that the Demon had attacked
Chotcau was not, as he had falsely
said, that he had approached 打
ear the
table, but that he had tried to steal a
gold cup from it
Here is another similar instance,
Johann von Hembach had hardly
grown to manhood when his wi化h
mother took him with her to the noc-
tur打
al assembly of Demons. And, be­
cause he was skilled i打its use，
she bade
him play the flu化， and climb a tree*
near by that he might the better be
heard. This he did; and having leisure
to observe their dances， and s化
uck
with wonder at the uncommon man­
ner of them (for everything there was
preposterous and ridiculous), he cx-
claimed: "Good God 1 where did this
fools and madmen come
from?" Scarcely had he said 舶 s when
he fell to the ground and was hurt
one shoulder^ and when he called upon
them to help him, he found himself
alone. This adventure he openly pro*
claimed; and while various opinions
were being expressed concerning it,
some maintaining that was a vision，
and others that it had really happened^
it so happened after a little that ail
doubt was removed* For one o f the
women who had joinW in that dance，

speak upon the matter.
He巧巧 a。 actual fact,打

based upon the deliberate and fic-

not proof enough to convince any-

On the other hand， t am quite will­
ing to ^ rec with those who think that
such Sw bat meetings at times exist
cnoly in dreams. It was vi
stated not loz^; since in he
by Catharine Prevotte (at Freissen,
September 1589) that sometimes
witches are fully awake and actually
present at these assemblies; but that
o f ^ they are merely visit^ in their
sleep by an empty and vain ^magina-
tion， For the Demoo$ are equally

such a view can 嘴 htly be defended,

The question of the souVs wandering

great difficulty and quite beyond the

tne soul with a vision ofall those things
the images of which they have with
incredible speed brought from far-
distant lands. Similarly, it is a not
altogether absurd opinion of those
opticians me打
tioned by Aris化tie (Z)f

is 打
ot by the penetration of rays but
by the reception of images, as in the

Without doubt (as Ar*istodc says)
music affects the mind i打various ways，
a打

very widely swayed by its modula­

said {Dial. II) that, if children were

may well be added a third kind of

as Margareta Janina (at Morhanges,
Sept. 1587) and many others have

with his fingers upon a horsc^s skull
fbr a lyre, as was told by Margareta
Ooliaria (at Vergaville, O 化 1856),
Sybilta Capcllaria (化化研，
N ov.巧86),
and Sinche打 May of Osthehn upon
her trial at Amance, June 1586;
another beats an oak tree with a cud­
gel or heavy club> and so produces a
roaring sound like the beating of
heavy drums， as Joannes Bulmer and
Dcsideria his wife said they had seen
done; and all the whUe the Demons
sing with a rau cou s,化umpc^like
voice, and the whole mob with roar­
ing and harsh cries make the heavens
echo, and frenzicdly rage, shouting,
hissing and yelling. Altogether it is
like those choruses of me Roarers
mentioned by Athenaeus when quot-
ing from Clearchus, hi which everyone
sang as he plea化d without heeding
the choragus; or like the orders
shomed to the rowers when a storm
or 化mp巧t is threatening.
By tKis 化ey are all utterly worn
out: nevertheless, before they arc dis­
persed, they arc obliged to thank the
Demon inordinately, as if he had cn-
化named them witn the gladdest and
most graceful music. For if any of
them neglects or refuses to do this,
he is at o打
ce beaten so savagely and
cruelly that, as those who have ex­
perienced it testify, he often has to
:eep to his bed lor two days after
it. This was affirmed by Jeanne

化ct，
But perhaps we have devo化d too
much time to a not very impoi*tant
matter: though it was not altogether
to be omitted， so that me打 may know
that it is not without purpose that the
Demons affect such harsh and dis­

can hardly be distingui油ed or recog-
nized, unless it be that they are wilder
and more savage than is usual in
domestic cats; and so it is cons化ntly
affirmed by nearly all who have ever
witnessed this matter.
Sometimes a man becomes jealous
of one 占'his fellows who has bee打care-
Atl and di咕 ent in caring 仿r hU flocks,
and is anx&us to 行

tore up some grass and threw it
against the trunk of a tree, saying cer*
tain words; and at once there came
out a wolfwhich immediatelyfell upon
the designated flocks. Indeed there
could be no more fitting agent for such
work than that beast which is more
than all others endowed by nature for
depredation.
At times also Demons a fpear m the
form of a bear, when they wbh to
seem as terrible as possible to their
disciples. This is especially the case
when they raise up tempests and show
themselves in all their monstrous
horror. Barbeline Rayel (Blainville,
Jan. 1587》 stated 出at she had more
than ODce witnessed such manifesta*
tions; and added that, to enhance the
horror, they med to difag behind them
a long train o f cymbals and belb and
chains, to the noise c£ which they
added an appalling howling. But I
am inclined to thin£ that she was de­
luded in this matter, taking the false
appearance for the truth in her great
panic and confusion. Nevertheless

Lastly, the form which they most
gladly assume is that of a goat. This
they take whe打they have not to under-

would exh化U themselves to their dis­
ciples to be worsh中ped with some
ceremony, and wou display them­

it be that it behoves a King to appear

* wished to
trace its origins further back, it will be
found that it has come down to us
from the most ancient tim巧. For
Hcsychius and (Mher Greek wri巧rs
have recorded that there stood promin-
c打
dy in the 化mple of Apollo a huge
goat or ram of bronze, to which divine
honours were paid. A further proof
that the Demons took an immoderate
delight in hc.goats as a sacri行
ce is pro*
vided by the story of Theseus, who was
about to sacrifice a she^goat to Venus
0打 the sea*shorc, whereupon she at
0打
ce changed it into a hc.goat, as if
that were the only victim which was
pleasing to her; and therefore she was
afterwards called 締 ‘化
。
知 • Strabo and
Pausanias have record品 that the same
thing happened in the 化mple ofCalHa,
which was on Mon化 Gar^no, as well
as in that temple where the oracles of
Amphiaraus were delivered. And the

other rustic Gods whom the blind

raised from it enough rain to wa化r

witches have stated that the ringiiig of
bells is quite without eflect unless it is
done early; that is, before (he cloud

At all even坛 wc mu巧 come before 在c

says:

For He isjust as ready to take away a
present evil as to avert a threa化打mg
and impending one. Every single
mome打
t is timely and opportune for
prayer to Him {S. Luxe xviii. i).
Therefore it 化Uows that the above
warning given by witches is an inven，
tio打devised by their Liulc Mas化r$ ;n
order that men should be cut off from
all hope of divine help during their
actual miseries and calamities* Feuxen
Eugel stated in addition that the sound
of bells was useless and ineflective, if
during the exorcisms one ofthe witches
should be named by the concubine of
the priest; but I consider this to be
ridiculous and absurd.
And although some of 】
a化 have
denied that Demonshave in the air the
power of causing hail and similar
calamities, and that therefore it is a
vain and idle superstition to ring belts
as a protection against the violence of
s化rms; yet 化ey agree that Demons
arc at times permit化d by God to per-
form many extraordinary feats， in
which they very clearly show their
打
ature, and that they do ma打
y thi打
gs
which are beyond the bounds of our
perceptions or understanding. This is
clearly shown in the sacred histone of
Job, and in the £pisd巧 of S. Paul
[Epkesians ii, 2), where power over the
air is manifestly ascribed to the
Demons.
Warning of the advance and im-
sending attack of 化c enemy is give打

one would condemn th巧 practice，
si打
cc the sound of such martial trum*
peting has in it something which acts
as a protection for even those who 這

who go even fiiithcr in 化eir defence

iad diedj used to sit in the same scat ia
which he had sat in his life^ where he
preserved an unbroken silence. I pass
over cou打
tiess other examples w&ich
have occurred in more recent times*
To such instances Christian verity
has added its own CO打
tribudon, but
with this distinction and difference;
nam ely,化at some spirits arc well dis­
posed and kindly to men and every*
舶 ng good ;$ to be looked for from
them^ whereas others are vengeful and
injuriou》 and every p!ague and affiic,
tion is to be feared from them. If the
good spirits find a man bowed down
with dejection, they raise him up and
stre打
gthen him by their power; as
happened to Abr^am ’s slave,巧agar,
when she and her son Isbmael were
des王era化 with 化irst in 化e wilderness
ofAecrsheba ((7饼^沁 xxi，

she was afraid, first comforted her and
told her not to fear, and then bade her
be of good hope for the fbi*tunc of her
son Isnmael (x^ 3 and 4). We read in
the Acts of the Apostles that the same
thing happened to Cornelius the Cen-
turion; for he was at A口t 打
ot a little
化rri6ed at the sight of the A 巧 cl, but
was At 0打
ce delivered fro饥 his and
was to!d that his pray俯 had been
heard and thst his alms were gra化ful
and acceptable to God, and that he
might confidently look forward to all
happiness and prosperity. And when
the women went at daybreak on the
Sabbath day to the sepulchre of our
Saviour, there appeared to them an
Angel clodied ;。 a garment as whUe as
snow, who, when 化cy were i打 dread
of his coun化nance and raiment，化Id
them to lay aside all fear; and so
they were reassured he told
eve
when

《 rything that they must do.
But those other spirits, when they
appear (o a man> leave him half dead

cons化rnation will not so easUy detect
their frauds and impostures， and that
any thought of wcU-doing which may

ma打
ner be shaken off and destroyed，
For Plutarch quotes Thucydides as
sayi凸
g that by far the most prolific
fruit of 化打or IS that it breaks 巧 and
kills every good intention. And Cicero
(换 III) quotes from an old
poet: i‘Fear doth benumb me and
casts out all wisdom." Plautus* also
says: "Fear puts the whole soul into

that the ancients thought that the God
Pan was the causer of sudden terrors
and unexpected fears;注

comes to my mind concerns 汪certain

hurriedly looked round for some pro*

another woodman; and when he
looked more closely at him (as is cu$*

he noticed that his nose kept shooting

degree that it was easy to believe in the
tru化 of what he said had happened*
The story was still further 5ubstan**
dated by the r巧 ort given by 的me
other woodmen of what they had seen
from a distance; namely, tkat it had
seemed to them that the air in that
place had become thick and involved
m dense smoke.
The 化Mowing example bea口 out the
same argument. Etienne Nicole of
Grand Bouxierc$ sous Amance had
hired out, in April 1588, so瓜e wine
cask$ to a magutrate named Didier,
and repeatedly sent his wife jacobeta^
who was a famous witich, to demand
from Wm the agreed price. A t last
Jacobeta grew weary of asking
indignant at having lost so
labour^ and began to brood deeply
over some means of pu打
ish 打
g
Didier fbr hU subterfligcs, seeking fbr
some opportunity to injure him sec-
re tly ,向 canwhUc it fell out very aptly
that Didier was bidden to go and
live in a !〇
打
ely place by himself, be­
cause his hou巧 had been infected with
化e plague; and he and hb household
made their abode in some isolated
huts. La化 one night (at the instance
ofJacobeta) the Demon attacked him
and his only son as they dwelt there,
with so horrible a clamour aod roaring
that it seemed as if the heavens were
loosened and 色lUng upon their roof*
That this ww 凸
o feigned 化rror
maliciously invented by Didier in
order to spread^dlerumourswas shown
by what followed; fbr bo化 he and hb
son were made so HI by It that 姐
who saw them gave up all hope for
them.
民elevant to this argument also u the
^tory, which will be 化Id in more detail
10 its own place, of the mine to whom,
as she was watching by a child^s cradle,
there appeared the Demon of Erik

A similar disas化r befbU Colombiers,
a village six miles from Toul, within
our own memory. At the very cod of

peasant had his cottage, humble
enough but clean as his fortune would

but when u e y became so used to this
that they took no 打

laughed at it^he could not endure such
contempt and at dead of night set fire
to the cottage so that it was instantly
burned down almo巧 to the ground. 1
chanced to be travelling that way a few
days la化r and, hearing of this event
from the villagers, resolved to to my­
self and see the ruin, so that i could
more dearly and authoritatively report

In this connexion it is not inapposite
to rela化 a story told in his vernacular
ton矿le by the Spanish wri化r Torque*
xnada {H

eron^Dial. 3). There was,
he says> at Salamanca a matron who化
house was commonly reported to be
haunted by this sort of stoning. Hear­
ing this rumour, the mayor of the city
resolved hiniselfto prove whether there
was any truth in these constant reports^

among these there were two

pec化d 化at tKe whole story had been
invented by them so that their lovers
might have easier access
Accordingly, the mayor went
bouse at tAe hour whe打 the stoning
was said to be most frequent; and with
him went no less than twenty of the
townsmen, some of whom he sent with
a light to sec whether there was any­
one at the top of the house who wa3
thus throwing stones at the servants.
They carefully searched every corner
and reported that they had found
nothing which could cause such
haunting; yec they determined to go
down to the basements, to which they
came from 化e diningroom，
这
nd wait
化c化 a liule in 化e hope ofdiscovering
anything that might be there. Ana
hardly were they mere before a great
油ower of stones began to fall upon
them with a loud noise, passiog by all
their legs, however, svithout hurting
them* So they again sent some to see
where so heavy a 洗ower of stones
could come from; and when every-
where was ibund emp巧 as beTore,
many began to feci convinced that the
whole matter was indeed due to the
arts and 术agic of Demons; and 化 叩
were further streng;thcned in this
opinion by 出e fact & at a continuous
hail of ston巧 fell about their heads
even after they had rushed out of the
house terror. At last one of them,
反eling more cooiiderxt at a safe dis-
tance^ picked up one of the stones and,
after havi打
g carefUUy no化d its shape
and appearance* threw St back at tne
housc> saying "If thU comes fro瓜 you,
O Demon, throw it back to me at
once.，* It was hnmcdiawly hurled
back, though without doing any
damage; whereupon they ceased to
have the slightest doubt but that the
matter was just as the matron had at
first reported,
I remember also that> when the p«-
tiience was raging at Toulouse &bout
the year 1563, 1 was in Auch and was

not slightly moles化d by a wa打化n

hurled hither and 化ither^ but 化II 化

and the bolts of the door were shot;
yet 化ere was 打
othing hi the chamber
out the gaminjj-board, a table and
chairs，
no打
e of which could have con，
cealed any mechanism for producing
such results.
In this manner, as I have said> do
the good and evil angels differ in their
reasons for appear*ing to men; for their
motives are m every respect contrary,
and as opposi化 as is kindness to
hatred, comfort to terror, help to harm,
or bene反

lows also, as I sai^ at the tk巧inning,
that it imposs化le wkhout grave

which concern them巧Ives in the aifairs

may be some who think that these were
miracles proper to that age, which God
permit化a as being then of u化 i打 the
iUi*therancc of the Gospel 化aching,
but that such miracles are no longer
needed, and that there is 打
0 authority
for believing in them. To such 1
answer that recent history is full of ex­
amples of such occurrences, as we shall
fully show la•
化r in this work, and that
fresh instances keep coming to light
every day, I shall here relate a few of
these, which arc clearly 化St巧ed in 化e
records of the Provinces in which they
occurred.
At Gironcourthi theVosges Province
there a s化ongly enough built castle
from the su町mit of which some dies
were thrown down by lightning. Not
long afterwards (Oct. 1586) Sebas-
tiana Picarda was charged with witch*
craft in that village and confessed to
the Judge that this had been the
of a Demon and herself. "For,，
said, "we were t<^cthcr in <
rushing upon the castle to destroy it
entirely, but this was not in our power:
yet we were able to inflict a
damage upon it, so that we should not
altogether fail in our attempt/*
The following is similar. A certain
man named Kuno, who was a ma^s*
tra化 at 民onchamp in the parish ot S.
Clement, where he lived, was with his
servants making hay in the country
when he saw a heavy storm brewing in
the sky, and made ready to run home.
But whUe he was about this, the巧 was
a sudden flash of lightni打
g， and he saw
six oak 化ees near him torn up by the
roots, while a seventh which still stood
w asaH rcn tan d to m asifb yclaw s.
He then made all the more haste, and
i打 his hurry dropped his hat and the
implements which he was carrying；
and there came another crack of
thunder，
a打
d he saw in the top of an
oak near by a woman resting, who (as
is probable) had bee打化t down there
from a cloud. Looking more closely at
her, he recognized her as an old woman

nd at once
began to upbraid her i打the following
words: "Are you that vile Margareta

ot w化hout
reason that everyone hassuspected you
of being a w!tch， How came you here
;n that $ta化？ " She answered: "Pardon
me, I beg you, and keep what you
have seen secret. If you will do this for
me, I will undertake that neither you
nor yours shall ever suffer the least
harm from me." If anyone feels a
doubt about this, let him k打
ow that it
was proved, not only by 化c evidence

Here it is apposite also to reU化 what
I have learned, on the authority of
those who cxmducied them, from other
capital trials. A storm burst with
much thu打如r and 1帥 tning upon the
slopes of the hUl Alwnbcrg, which is
near the region in Hohlcch in the
Vosges district; whereupon the shep*
herds and herdsme打who were keeping
their flocks there (since it was expo化a
to the s化rm) sought shelter in the
ncigbbouri打
g woo3s. Suddenly they
saw two peasants clinging to a打
d en-
化ngkd i打the 化p讯ost branches of the
trees, and 80 化rrified that it was ob­
vious that they had 打
ot come there of
their own will, but had been driven
there by some u打
expected chance or
impulse. The dirty and bedraggled
appearance of thdr c]〇
th巧 also, which
seemed as 化 巧 had been dragged
throu晏h all sorts of mud a打
d thorns，
gave 指rther point 化 the suspicion that
they had been dragged here and there
by their Little Mas化r according to his
custom. They were the more con-
firaied hi this opinion when, after 化cy
had remai凸
ed there for some time to
ma)ce sure of what they had seen» sud-
dcniy without their 打
oting A e two
men disappeared• Finally, all doubt
was removTO not long afterwards when
the two me打 were imprisoned and
freely confessed everything just as the
shepherds had reported it.
There is a hou化 lying on the left as
you go 行cm Bclmo打
t to Waldcrsbach,
on to the top of the roof of which the
same two men once fbn from a su>rm

There is no lack ofmodern examples

I d 化e year 1563 there was at Paris a
woman given to such practices, whose

account ofthe nobiii巧 an占importance
of her 位沉Uy. I we打

was my custom since she was a fellow*

From time immemorial it has been
believed that the souls of the dead can
be rahed from the tomb and， by means
of incantations, called back to their

mortal frame is so dissolved by death
that, except by some special favour of
Almigluy God， it cannoc again be knit

through the agency of a Demon which
has en化red it ;ju化 as wc sec in the case

There is a further consideration
'which does much to explain this whole
matter. For since they arc foul and
unclean spirits it should not be
prising that, as a pig returns to its
wallowing placc> they should find their
favourite habitation and lodging In
stinking corpses. And therefore it is
that ghosts, tnat is Demons, are chiefly
to be met with in churchyards and in
places of punishment and executioa
for criminals. For it is foolish and im«
piously pagan to believe that souls
Daunt and hover about such places
through longing for their discarded
bodies, since there are fix^ and con*

should be traced round the tomb where
a corpse is buried.
To all this mu巧 be added the fact

化Us of a similar 化ing hap-
pening at Tralles in Asia to a girl who
had been six months dead. Damis and
Philostratus, in their Life of Apol­
lonius of Tyana, record that he often
restored the dead to life. And not long
since there was a Germa打story circu­
lated writing of a man named
Aulicus who, being told that his wife
was dead a打
d that her body had bee打
laid in a tomb, hastened home to look
after his affairs and, brooding much
upon her late into tlie night as is usual
in the ca巧 of such a loss, saw her 过
is-
fobing herself in her customary man-
ner and prepa!*ing to go to bed as
usual. In this purpose, since he had
received certain news of her death, he
opposed her for a little; but being con-
V…ced by her speaking in her own
voice and by her clear odiibidon ofher
body,he permitted her to lie downwith
him; and fbr a short time they lived
their usual daily life together, until by
the po化nt words of an exorcist the
Demon, who had raUed up that
CO巧巧 and occupied it in o^ cr to
deceive and, if possible, destroy the
husband, was compelled to depart
from it. It is certain that no exorcism
could have had this result if 化e
woman，s own soul had truly been in
her body; but just as the law provides
every 0立
poitunity fbr dispos化ssing A
man of what he has unjustly usurped^
so no one need marvel that the Demon
is thus ca巧 out from his insidious occu­
pation of a dead body, if he realizes
what 化rce 化e巧 is in adjurations and
exorcisms to effect 化is.

But since this story opens up certain
questions worthy of consideration a$

It clear that the Demon holds this
to be l>y far the greatest and richest
fruit of his insidious wiles; and that，
like a dishonest usurer, he is alwa)^
adding to it and increasing it by some
fresh impiety: drawing error upon
error, as S. Jerome says {In prooem

and always more and more deeply en-

which wc arc now concerned is very
)crtinc打
t 化 this proposition. For first,
laving seduced the man to an unspeak­
able venery and pestiferous wenening,
he fbreed him to the atrocious murder
of his only son ；
and then, when he was
driven almost to the very last despair
by his remorse for so great a crime, he
led him headlong to an execrable
idolatry which is the culminalion of all
sin; thus showing himself for what he
has been from his beginning, the
would-be rival and jealous afFecter of
Divine honour.
When God wished 化 t巧t Abraham>s

enumerated all His benefits to Wm,
bade him o报 r up h b 《 on kaac as a

sin not to obey God any化ing what,

not a God to wish him to be cruelly

delights that Ape the Demon to re*

could only be known from the man

would find a handsome young man
whom she would easily be able to love.
And it happe打

greedily wallowed in carnal beastli­

and he went away ashamed and sor，
rowing with his puipose unaccom-

(Gi巧ncourt, Oct. 1586) was twelve
years old his mo化er led him to a
similar abominable marriage.
For Colette Fischer (Mainz, May
1585) and many other whehes say that
it is a 行
equent custom fbr Demons
to contract marriage with humans;
and indeed Bertrande Barbier and
Sinchen May of Speirchcn (Forbach,
Aug. 1587) said tnat they had been
present at such nuptials at times when
they happened to be at night Sn the
place where 化c 打
als of 此at dis­
trict were crucified; and they added
that, in place of the usual 皆ft of n ring,
it was enough for the bridegroom to
stoop down and blow upon the bride^s
anus. Agnes Theobald (Puttclange,
Sepc. 1590) said that she was present
when dathalioa and Eugel of Hudlin*
gen were solemnly espoused to their
r巧pective Beelzebubs, and that the
roasted flesh a black shc’goat was
served at the wedding feast. Domin­

The following is to the same effect,
Fran^oisc Hacquart of V illi (1591),
in order at last to free herselffrom such
molestation, had abandoned to the
Demo凸 her daiughter Jana whe打 she
was as yet scarcely seven years old;
and among her other confessions she
chanced to hint this fact to the Judge.
As the daughter's testimony confirmed
this sta化ment, and si打

and unerring account of the nocturnal

Upon this there aro巧 no small dis-

who did 打

we do: that one polluted so great a

that it was impossible to plead in

account children are spared in other
cases; for none could deny that he
had shown that persis化打cc of purpose
which belongs to one who harbours
the memory of an injury received in
spUc o七the lapse of umc; and, more*
over, he had taken his revenue in a
secret and skulking manner, like one
who was quite conscious of wrong­
doing. In the case of a manifestly
hideous crime it is not enough to

purpo化 of purifying their country or
exp化ting some crime, p!a运

goat which the Hebrews used to send
out into the wilderness. But nothing
of 也is could rightly be applied to th技
boy, who had no vow Sn return

who would not by his
d说比 expiate a public danger or 化e
death of another^ whose punishment,
in short, would in no way be exem-
plary save as a reproach to Na化rc 化r
not having more wisely and com-
pletely instruc化d and 化rdfied 化e
early childhood of mankind. That it
was in no sense apposUc to instance the
fact that an animal which has once

仿r 化" e was a vast 出無rence、 etween
slaughtering an animal^ which is born
in order to *^6slau gh ter, and taking
the life of a human being for whose
benefit Na扣re allowed the gift oflife
to the other animals. Not even 出e
law always demanded the same pun*
ishment for the same offence; but
lightens the sentence for one man on
account，of his position and foruine,
while it increases and makes it heavier
仿r another on account ofhis meanness
and poverty; for (as Pliny says)
nothing couM be more in«q山tabic
than to pass an equal sentence upon
all and sundry. It was, then, un-
w<Nthily done to demand that men
a打
d beasts should be subject to the
same law. It in no way detrac比d from
the innocence and ingenuousness of
children that they had a long memory
for an injury; that they glaSly seized
upon a chance to repay one; or that
Ujok care not to be caught in the

bru化 beasts, to which no one would
for that reason rightly attribute a con­

nc巧 of a d e^ depended upon the iti-

reason the law dealt more kniently
with a murde化r whose only in化ntion
was to wound his victim; but there
could be no question of crime on the

it was beside the point to distinguish

repugnant to the law, which is, as
A^is^tle 化巧, bawd upon principles of
)rtion, to impose a public pun-
murder upon a child of
tender age than to sentence an adult
man to be beaten and chastised with

Si打
cc we arc 0打the subject of these
injuries 50 secretly and astoundingly
caused by witchcraft, I will add one
more exampie which must exci化 no
little wonder. Jana Blasia of Baias-*
les*6 ain$ had a $on«in-law named Ray-
ner with whom she lived in the same
house. Claude Gerard had given this
Rayncr his breeches to mend, but had
been quite unable to get them back
from him for his use; aod at last in
exasperation he went 化 反 ayner 化
ask him when he was going to make an
end of his sub化rfuges ana delays, but
found that he was not the house and
that only Biasia, his 伍othcr-in-law,

family. So he asked her to return him
his breeches, saying that ifher fine son-

to say nothing and to wa

made Hct very an的 ， but she decided

breeches back: meanwhile she asked
h;m to be so good as to sit down by

tas化 one o f her apples that she had

vitation more than once^ saying that
he had no leisure to stay any longer^
and that he had no wish fbr 化e food
she was offering him; but one of the
apples stuck to the palm of his hand
and was so hotthat he at once tried to
shake it o迁 with the other hand;
wh巧eupon both his hands were so

it became clear that hismisfortune was
due to witchcraft, one o f the neigh­
bours who was rather more shrewd
told him 化 go back to the place where
the evil had 行

did, and the old belda扣 Blasia,
treated the affair as ajoke and laughed
at him ; yet she rubbed his arm a little
down to the hand, until the apple
dropped out; and at 0打

ceased) and he regained the full use of
his hands.
In these stories the fbllowing points
appear to me chiefly worthy of 打

First,化at, ju 巧as emperors grant cer*

effect. Therefore it follows that some
of the examples which have been
known must derive their caus6 from
some higher and more po化nt source，
and that they are altogether different
from cases that are brought about by
purely natural means*
The amulets covered with unknown
characters (to u化 the words of Apu*
leius), worn by criminals to ensure
their silence und肿 化 iture, cannot
derive their numbing virtues from
nature; for 化cy. induce a stab of
torpor only at a dme when^ by reason
of intense pain, sleep is the last thing
to be cxpcc化d. And they are 护 ncrally
found written upon tiny pieces of
parchment, and may be wor打 at any
other time without Dr*inging the very
least desire or dispositio打 to sleep.
Yet jui*ists of no mean repu化 have
held that these charms enaole a pris，
o打
cr to laugh at torture, and oflen
hinder the judges from extracting the
truth. In the trial held not long since
by the magismucs of Schle府 tadt of
the assassins i凸 G打many of Chri^
tiana, the Most Serene Queen of the
be Danes, there was one of the mur，
derers, named Benigno, who could
easily have escaped punishment; for
he was abroad when ne was inquired
for, and might have saved himself by
flight But, relying upon 0打
e of these
amulets • given to hW by a market
stroller, he voluntarily offered himself
for trial nor did his CO打
fidence prove
groundless; for all the instruments of
torture were worn out before the man
himself felt any effect from them, and
so he was unbound quite unhurt» and
without having confessed* But as he
was on the point of being di^harged
from priso口
， he 仿und Kimself tin扣 e
to bear any longer the load of his 钟 h,
and of his own accord confessed his
crime and finally paid the penalty
with his life.
Here it may be ai^ ed that this is
less surprising the case of one who
wishes and strenuously exerts him £^
to maintain silence; since the power
which, wi化 God's permission, Satan
exercises over a man is never so strong
as whe。 it is used with the full con-
sent and approbatio打of the man him-
self; but that wc ought not to think
that men can be rendered thus coma*
tose against their own w ill;化r in that
case 庄c whole human race would be
equally subject to such influence* To
this I answer that there is little or no
diiference between QegUgence> or
^uiferance of a thin!, and consent to
it, since such 打巧ligence gives the
enemy every chance of assault and
attack. For ne who neglects to set the

only to bring forward such instances as
are attested by the evidence of many

d Forbach, and nearly
all who have hitherto been tried for
this crime in the kingdom of Austria,
and whose confessions have come into
my hands, have maintained that they
changed themselves &om men into
cats * as often as they wi油ed to eiUcr
another man's house secretly ;。 order
to pU打

These statements are 心)me out and
substantiated by the evidence of many
who hav^ reported that they have been
attacked by whch巧 in such shape;
and the evidence ha$ tallied in all
respects with regard t o 【he fact itself^
the place^ the persons, the time, and
every circumstance and detail which
could be required to establish com­

Rayel (Blainviile, Jan• 巧87) is quite

The Demon can so CO打

man behaves and conducts himself
not as a man, but as that beast which

Secondly, t h ^ illusions can be
caused extrinsically, when the Demo凸

found a safe way for her, and told her
to bring some live coals home with

Lolla came in the next day as usual
from the salt kilnsat Dieuze (which are
the most famous in all Lorraine); for
he would be at hand and would upset

the threshold of the house of Jean
Antoine, with the result that, after his

妃 her b巧asts was dried up and, in
consequence, the child to whom she
was then giving suck died; this being
what the witch had chiefly desired to
happen.
t 前 just as of all living creatures
their lust chiefly to kill men, 50 of
human creatures witches take an
especial delight in the slaughter of
infants and those who by virtue oftheir
age arc iimoce打
t and guild巧s. This
fact i$exemplified in the behaviour of
Jacoba C&valUa, that Drigic men-
tio打
cd above， and OdUla，who, as I
remt扣ber, h&d an excessive tax
(according to their own computation)
;mpo$cd them by the AS巧巧0打 of
the village in which they lived, and
wished to be avenged for that injustice
by some signal act of retribution. The
Demon d巧 not 亿il to provide them
a打 apt and convcD化nt means of
attainiog {heir wish by scattering their
poison a3 thickly as possible on the
grazing grounds of the cattle of that
village; and, to remove their last
di巧culty, he told thtm 化 at they could
easily prepare 化c necessary poison by
)ou凸山凸g up the first worms that they
bund until they were reduced to a
powder fine enough to sprinkle. When,
therefore, they had acted accordingly,
wi化in a few days there perished in tliat
village a hundred ana fifty head of
cattle, as Drigic said, or a hundred
and sixty according C
O Odilhi，$ ac，
count; for they were questioned separ-
a化ly, and agreed in everything except
the numbers. The truth of their state­
ments was attested by the facts them-
se^es; for at about the time indicated
that number of cattle was lost by the
vUIa复
ers.
Notice that the herbs, du巧, worms
and other such trash scattered about
by wUches do not only cause sickness
or death, against which defensive
measures can be taken when they arc
CO打veyed by contagion as in the case
of the breatiung or touching of plaguc-
infes化d ma行ers; but 化ey also break
or weaken Umbs, and diminish, draw
off and dry up the milk in the breasts.
It is obvious that such effects can only
proceed from some secret co-operarion
of the Demon. This conviction is
strengthened by the fact that these
m这
t化rs arc harmful only to those
a口 ins【 whom they are iruentionally
directed; whilst everyone else can
walk over them and tread u护 n
them sa拓 ly a打d without cxperiendDg
any hurt. This is proved beyond
doubt 吟 化 e following performance
of Alexw Drigic (Haraucourt, Nov.

fem to scatter 0打 the path most 任c-
quently used by the daughter of a

this calami巧 should befall o化ers also
who went that way, whom she had no
wish to injure. The Demon, however,
told her to be at ease on that score,
since the poison would affect no one
except her for whom it was intended 三

and it happe打
ed just as he had said，
For of al those who passed by that
way, only that shepherd's daugluer
met her death because of it. Not long
aAerwards the same witch miserably
a巧icted the health of Humbert the
Cas化Uan by rubbing his couch with
the same powder; but the charm was
deadly to nim alone; for many others,
bo化 Dcfbre and after him, had sat on
that couch.

told here. One of these concerns

trea化d witn gross unfairness by a
ffcllow-townsman named N., and
thought that she would be abundantly
avenecd upon him if she could poison
the five cows upon the produce of
which he and his family depended.
But there was danger of being caught
in the act if she did this by touching
each of them whh a poiso打
cd wand,
which was the method she used in
her other poisonings. To relieve her of
this fear, therefbre, her Little Mas化r
told her to go befbre dawn to the
pastures to which most of the cattle
were usuaHy driven, and seaucr about
a poison powder which he gave her.
Yet she stui hesitated, being afraid lest
the poison would kill the whole herd,
which she wished to spare except for
the cows of that N, who was the only
one she wa打化d to inflict such a loss

ut the Demo打assured her that
only his five cows would be harmed;
and so it proved; fbr only 化cy of aU
the herd died or contracted any

Away with them, then, away with all
who say that the talk ofa pact between
witches and Demons is mere nonsense;

lie, and arc aUested a打

case could be made out for this view,
there is also much 化 be 巧id for 化e
following opinion:— That Satan, as
the executioner and minis化r of God’s
wrath, nearly always acts independ­

men; and that he purposely demands

consent quite clear.
Beatrix Bayona (Gerbevillc, Aug.

Petrone Maxent, who had done her
some great injury; and at last the
Demon 巧 whom slic owed allegiance
undertook to accomplish this, provided
that she would give her consem. She
did not hesitate to say that that was
what she wished; and at once the
Demon attacked and killed the infant

he announced the deed to her, glory-

found out by long experience that the

Any crime that the witches them*

Demon had sprinkled a black pewder

further that when she had poisoned the
cook ofthe Lord of the village in which
she lived so that he only just escaped
death, she had first been most severely
bca化n by her Demon, and was then
compelled to put the matter in his
hands so that he might do the cook an
even grea化r injury， and even kill him
if he wished* When she had agreed to
this, he 行

much the same way Martha Maree-

Nicolas the cartwright because he had

One more example of this sort is
that of Jana Armacourt, at Lauch,

for any possible means to exact a (iilly

when she had so often proved that he

had only to give her consent, or to
leave the business to him, and it would
not be long before (he woman was
punished for her mischievous tongue.
Jana said that such was her wish, and
at once that busy minister flew to

And the whole thing was proved
beyond aoy doubt by the evidence of

It is a mat化r of the grea仿抗debate
whether any man can have so great
power against his fellows, or can have

can be 化e打in the case of B^Uerophon,

Others say that it is the influence of

reading that witches， by pronouncing
a curse in a certain formula, have
thrown many into a grievous sickness;
and then, moved by their prayers, or
by fear, or by some other reason, they
have restored them to health by re­
peating the same words backwards.
Thus the wound and the remedy both
proceed from the same words: even as
Circe took away and rcsto巧d men’s
reason with the same wand, and by
the same process changed men ^nto
beasts and oeasts into men: similarly,
it is recorded in many Hbtodcs that
there was a bull which fell down dead
when certain words were whispered ;
打
its ear, and was restored to life when
the same words were repea化d*

a deeper and more careful considera*
tton will show that their one true
source is the Demons: the reason
doubtless being that it was so arranged
by the pact between 化e Demon and
the witch; or that the same words
and characters and numbers arc used,
which wei*e at first ordained in the
)act of some 0化cr witch by whom
ater witches have been instructed.
For this reason S. Augustine {De
doctrina, Christiana, II) says that it was
so constitu化d in the abominable asso­
ciation of Demons and men as a pledge
of their treacherous and disloyal
friendship；
and we may well call it,
in the words of Isaiah, a covenant with
death and an agreement with hell.
Someone may say that this vicy
inconsis化nt with what we have jusi
said of the Holy Fathers, and Jesus our
Saviour, and His Apostles and dis­
ciples; but it is not so. For a man to
rush furiously and madly to avenge
a private injury is a very diffc巧nt
matter from being impelled by love
a打
d zeal for God，s glory to avenge that
which is done or said in con化mpt a打
d
despite of Him with the use of for­
bidden arts. It matters much whether
such an action is gra化ful and accept
able to God as furthering His purposes,
or whether He rejects it as proceeding
from unwort^ motives, when the
mes化nge巧of dhri巧came to a certaio
village of the Samaritans to prepare
the 打
eccssaries of life for the Lord and
化ose 化at were with Him, and 化e
men of the village rejected them and
would 打

their 巧 tes. His di泌iples James and
John said: "Lord, wilt thou that we
command fire to come down from
heaven and consume them, even as

It was 化r this reason also that
Onias, a just man who lived maDy
years ago, would not yield to the
prayers of his fellow-townsmen that he
should curse the prie舱 who， with
Anstobulus, had tuen sanctuary in
化c 化mpic, Josephus jW •乂IV,

atJerusalem, he had hidden hiimelfin

and led him to their camp, and asked
him, as he had once by his prayers

so prevented the failure of the crops,

The story of Balak is well known
even to 化e mo巧 ignorant: how he
se打
t 化e prophet BaTaam to curse the
1巧acii化s, but that he could not; for
the very a巧 upon which he rode
obstinately resisted him, and even
expostulated with its master in human
speech because he did not understand
tnat he was preven化d by Heaven from
that which he was has化ning to do.
And so, not only did he not curse the
Israelites, but they were blessed by the
very Demon who, it is ccitain, is above
all zealous fbr the dcs化uctiem of men.
(If the Demon wishes to hide his
wickedn巧s under a veil of probity， he
thinks that he cannot more conve­
niently do so than by assuming a hatred

nd dc化station oHhat very sin， Thus
it is no uncommon thing for the vilest
whores to speak in praise of mode巧y.)
Similarly, Plutarch 化 1

at Athens who could 打

to curse Aldbiades a【 the bidding of
the people, because she said that she
had cn化red 化e priesthood in order to

中herefbre it is the more 化 be
wondered at that such curses arc to-
day so frequently the mouths of
nearly all Christians, that through use
they have ceased to be regarded as
worthy of condemnation or rebuke;
and【hal the habiI has grown so strong
that they are often uttered without
thought, and Are no longer considered
a crime* Yet S. Jerome {In Leviticum)
proclaims that they who neglec【化
restrain their habit of cursing, even if
the curse docs not come from their
hearts， nevertheless (according to
Isaiah) sully their lips and befoul their
moutlis. S* Peter a!so, to put a greater
check upo打 that lice打
ce, strictly bade
us to speak blessings always, knowing
that wc were called to receive blessing
by inlierilance; and not to be pro­
voked by wrangling, not to be angered
by injuries, not to be exasperate by
con化打tion$. For even Michael the

body of Mo化s， did not dare to incur
the sin of blasphemy by cursing even
him who was most worthy of male*
diction，
What, then, must we think will be
the result of a carelessly uttered curse?
Surely that it will fail upon him who
uttered it; just as when a man shoots
a打 arrow into the sky, it often faUs
back upon himself. As the bird flying
aimlessly, as the swallow wandering at
large, so (says Solomon, Proverbs xxvi)
shall the curse cau化kss return upon
him who sent it forth. Yet still wc
dare to wish that wc may be damned
if a matter prove to be other than we
have s化ted it 化 be, although our
inner conscience CO打
victs us 0? insin­
cerity. Therefore we should not be
surprised if the Arch-schemer» who is
always i打 wait 化r us to make us his

But how vile a thing it is for angry

at the dead of night he set fire to the

she could not give any of it away with-

tiny morsels like chaff, and told her
to secrete it in Huyna's house, and to

Accordingly she rolled the napkin into

it to her 化r use i凸her loom, which she

And when Huyna said mat she did not

whole house caught fire so rapidly
that no help could be brought quickly

to its truth.

there, he said that he vKshed to bum
the tow打to ashes. When they thread

that he cared nothing for tneir threats,
since one of them was a whoremonger

during all this time she had regularly

There is in Metz a shrine t very
famous for the marvellous cures which
arc said to be effec化d by viituc oflc
beau Saint Bernard to whom it is
dedicated, although he has nev^ yet
been beatified. I remember seeing its
in化rior columns draped and hung
with linen cloths from which were
suspended bricks, coals> balls of tow
3nd hair， trumpery, bits of glass,
sword-blades,山 ns of lizards and

which, in 化e sight of any who cared
to be present, the sick who had been

had cith巧 vomi化d up or ejee化d

with a great eflbi% but had gone home

I might add many mo巧 such
exampl巧, if 化at had been my purpose
in b^hmiog this work; but si打
ce I
have lately §[iven my mind somewhat
to this subject, I will relate two
instances which came to roy notice in
this very At Richthum, a village
in the tcrritoi7 of Count Otho the
Nicolas Wanneson (Mor*
hange, Sep化mber 1587) began to
sa分
er from so grievous a sick打
ess that
his recovery was despaired of* A cer*
tain witch who was his neighbour had
done this to him by her evil arts. As
is the way of those suffering from a
long and almost desperate ^ifness, he
an»ously asked aJl who visited him
if they knew of any cure to tell him
of U for 化e 巧ke of the pity which all
must feel for the misfortunes of others*
It so happened that the wkch was
present among them; and cither she
was moved by pity (a quality in which
witches profess that they are not
entirely lacking), or else she was
afraid of being put to the question by
the 5;ck man's relatives (化r many
threats to that effect had purposely
been uttered by all and sundry ; but
in any case she said that $he had seen
people cured of^the 巧me sicknesa as
soon as they had made and performed
a vow to one of the Saints. She added
that Ic beau Bernard was particularly
化mous ibr such cures, fbr she did 打
ot
know o f any who had ever sought his
help in vain; and she advised him to
send someone who was wUIing to go to
his shrine with a gift, and expiate his
sickne&s for him with the customary
prayers. He quickly found one, Hans
Jacob by namc> wno at once under*
took and performed that pilgrimage，
did cverytning as he had been told oy
the witch, and re化rned to give an
account of all that he had done and
seen. It was then agreed by aU who
were at that time with the sick man
that, at the very mome打
t that Hans
had presented hU vodve ofTering， from
that 巧me time the man had begun to
recover; for it was then that with a
great clTort he had begu
pieces of glass and balls of hair. These
objects were show打 to Jacob in an
earthen vessel to convince him of the
tru出 ；a打
d Ivlatis Hay, Maths Meier,
Nobis Pet化r and several others,
although they were questioned separ*
atel/j gave the same account in the
same words.
I打 October 巧 88 a young kins，
woman of mine brought me two iron
nails which^ together with a great
quantity o f stinking matter^ she had
vomiteo up in the sight ofall who were
with h^r in the house at the time. All
of us who knew the history and pro­
gress of her illness judged that these
were the leavings of a sickness with
which she had 货 en stricke打 the year
before by Nicolaea Stephana (ofwnom
we shall have something to $&y la化r).
For by reason of that vomiting a swel­
ling on her stomach which had been
as hard as a s化ne b巧 an to subside,
and her health, which had been very
poor for a whole year, began to
improve and mend by degrees.
中o 化is I may weH add a parallel
case which Lang, a打 Englishman,
writes that he witnessed in the year
1530 when he was practisi打
g medicine
i打the train of the Princ货 Palatine;
namely, that there was in their Pala-
tina化 a dc巧oniac woman who, af扣r
long a打
d acute pains in the beUy，
vomited out of her mouth some long
curved iro打nails, and some brass pins
wrapped round with wax and hairs*
And t、 at such occurrences were known
to the ancients is shown by what
Julius Obsequens recounts to have
happened at Aretium, i丘 the COnsul-
ship of Cnaeus Domitius and Cams
Cassius, to a certain woman who
vomited a quantity of flour from her
mouth, wh; e she 如 cted many other
things besides down her nose- And
our own time there have been books
enough published which abound in
examples of this sort of prodigy.
But I shall not e公Uy be pe口uaded
to agree with those who hold that

to be, but 比at our mortal senses arc

For as fnr their argument that nothing
can come out but what has already

are of such a size that not even the

which arc the two la巧巧【

than one way. I打the first place,化ere

little animals like an化 io the urine,
and other such things, which are not

through the very narrowest chan打
ek,

d often through a凸 ope打 wound，
Lemne Levin, speaking on this vc^
subject, says {De occiuL Ttaturae mir*
cculiSf III, 40) that fragments of nails,
hairs, bricki, little bones, and stones
have often been seen to be squeezed
and extrac化d from purulent ulcers
and sores, a打
d 化at th巧 arc thought
to be formed by the concretion of
festelling 扣at化rs» But no one will
deny that such things have cither been
i打
troduced from outside，
or that they
have not remained so long in their
place without injury to the body.
And if examples be sought in proof of
the CO打化打non that they can be
inserted and introduced, there is no
lack of weU’at化巧ed evidence with
regard to the matter in the works of
recent authors of great praise and
repu化.
Ambroise Par《writes that there was
in Paris a learned man from Bourges
named Gamers, who incautiously
swallowed an ear ofcor打which pas化d
through his throat hito his lung; and
he was immediately seized with such
aciUc pai打
s that it seemed as if he must
die there and then. But Nature, which
打
eglects no possible means of pro­
acting herself, quickly fou打
d a way to
rid herself of that hurt: for the ear
worked its way through the lobe of
the lun巧， the rib muscles, and finally
the surrounding membrane, u打
til it
was ejee化d without any harm coming
to Camers. The $u巧cons were Fcmel*
and Huguct, men of high and honour*
able standing in the practice of
medicine.
Part pves another example which
is far more amazing even than the last>
both because of the si玄
c of 化c object
introduced and the da打
gerous d巧 th
of its penctratio打
， and because of its
wi打
ding and wandering throughout
the whole body without any fatal
result. There was (he savs) a shepherd
whom some rob占
ers 心 ind in the
fields and fbreed 化 swallow a six-mch
knife wUh a horn handle as thick a$ a
thumb. He swallowed ^
t， and retained
it in his body fbr six whole morufis;
but he became so thin and emacia化d
that it was obvious that he was i打very
great 巧 in. At last there appeared 0打
his groin a stinking al>scess which dis­
charged much foul 讯atter, from which
in the presence of all the town magis-
tra化s the knife was extracted. Jobert
of MoiUpelier, a physician! is said to
have kept it carefully in his museum
on account of its miraculous rarity,
having obtained it from the surgeon
who had healed the wound>and who
lived at Som^^cs, about c邮 t mUe$
away from Montpelier.
I shall take one more example from
the same source. The Pnnee de
Hoha打
, of 0打
e of the most noble and
化mous hou化s of Brit化ny: not long
ago kept for his pleasure a fool named
Guido who, as is the way of such 沉e打
to take rash and dangerous risks with
themselves, swallowed a knife-blade
three fingers long. Twelve days later
he discharged it by his anus, after it
had passed through all the great length
of his guts, of which the duodenum is
especially thi打 and narrow and is
rightly so named; and through all the

If then Nature, without transgress­
ing the limits which she has imposed
upon herself, can by her own working
either generate or admit such objects,
what mu巧 we 化ink 化at 化6 Demons
will do, to whose power (says Job)
no化ing can be likened or c〇
mpai*ed?
And if this be admit化dj there is
nothing (o hinder a Demon from rais*
ing up mountains to an enormous
height in a moment^ and then casting
them down into the deepest abys巧s;
from stopping the flow of rivers, or
even causing them to go backwards;
from drying up the very sea (if we
may bcHeve Apulcius); from bringi打
g
down the skies, holding the carih in
suspension, making fountains solid，
raising the shades of the dead, putting
out the stars» Ughtingup the very dark­
ness of Hell, and turning upside down
the whole schc阳e of this universe.
Wc often see iro打 softened and even
moken by fire, and again rest;ored to
its former rigidity by no grea化r forces
than are at the command of feeble
man. Then can anyone sdH refu巧 to
believe that the Demons, with the
great powers that are theirs, ca打intrcH
aucc through the many apertures into
the human body such j 化CC5 of iron
and brick and stone! Docs he think
their size is any obs化cle, when the
Demons can at their pleasure cause
them to contract and diminish even to
atoms a打
d 每 aia resume their former
size whe已they arc in position; or else
gaji _
so 出s化nd the passages into the
body that they are able to admit
them? What is there in this more
difficult than to destroy an aged oak
without breaking its bark, or a strong
tower without disin化grating the mor­
tar; or to cau化 a sword to was化 away
while it rests in shea化 ； or to grind
U) powder all the bones without harm，
ing the rest of a man^s body; or to kill
the fcctus whW
e sparing the pregnant
woman; or to melt bronze without
injury to iw receptacle; or 化 burst the
cask and kave all the wine sending
unspWled? Yet all these things are
done by lightnings either by its own
innate powers and properties, or else
as the agent of some Demon, as it is
more conveniently argued elsewhere,
I remember aho seeing ;n the Pro­
vince of Bordeaux those who healed
dislocated and broken limbs simply
by touching the girdles of those who
had been thus crippled, although they

Cato 巧 记 ，X X V III，2) also
says 化at the same thi打
g was done in
his day, I do not see how this can be
possible, unless we admit the secret
working of a Demo打who subtly enters
the affected limbs and applies some
u打
k打
own cure, very much m the way
that, as we have just said, he performs
many other prodigies in the human
body. And if anyone tries to reconcile
all 比ese things wUh 化e normal pro-
ce巧cs and operations of Nature, he
might just as well try to measure the
heavens with his hand.
But, it is argued (Cardan^ De subiil.,
X V III), juggle円 and conjurers so
delude the spectators* eyes that they
seem to thrust a knife into their
throats and then bring it out at their
mouthS) to pierce their breast with a
sword, to bury a hunting spear in a
vital part of their entraik, to cut off
their hands, to pierce through their
打
OSes, and inflict o化er wounds upon
themselves. Again, they draw great
lengths of string from their throats as
if they were unrolling a ball of it ；
they
mudla化 and cut 0巧 their ears; and
it is s^d that not long since in Ger«
man)^ one was seen to cut oflThi$ head
and immediately put it back in its
place without suffering any hurt.
1 hey devour a whole waggon of hay
together with the driver aud the
horses, and perform many other
marvels which, as they all con耗巧,
are done with the help of Demons.
To how much greater lengths, then,
will such deceptions proceed when
they are wrought by the Deroons
alone without the agency of a打
y man?
Will it not be very easy for them, when
a sick man ;s about to vomit, secretly
to place such pieces of iron and other
trash hi$ mouth so 化 at all the
spectators will think that they have
lice打vomited 1打the natural maimer;
or to create the illusion of a wound in
the skin, through which these things
appear i d be emitted? Surely, they
say, we should admit and a<±now-
this a$ bein良 by 仿r the more
!化dy a打
d probable explanation, and
less a打
【agonistic to nature.
But there is one fact which entirely
refutes such an argument. These
objects arc 凸
ot only see打by the eyes,
which arc admittedly open to decep-
tion: the reality of them is proved 右
y
the fact that they can be touched and
化U, whenever they are surgically
€X【
rac化d from various bodies. I re.

who was 化c打 Mayor of Charmes,

that if they cared to 处 en U， a ball

lanced the abscess, and found in it a
big ball such as weavers u巧, which
was whh difficul巧 cxtrac化d by the
su巧eon, Vokella, sight of all who
were present. I saw this ball with my
own eyes when, at my father's order,
was brought to our house by the
surgeon; an芽alUhe 化rv&ntsexamined
it carefully and auentivdy, Lang,
who化 aiuhorky I have recently
praised) has recorded a similar
mstancc. There is, he says, ;n Ger.
many a town of the name of Ulrich,
where a farmer caUed Nensscs化r was
a巧ic化d with mys化lious bodily pains
so violent that he could not endure
them» and cut his throat; for while he
was yet alive an iro打 nail had been
ex化ac化d from under his skin, causing
him great pain. The surgeons, wish­
ing to examine and discover the cause
of this rare sickness^ opened the dead
man’s body; a打
d in the presence of a!1
the townsfo化 who cared to at化nd,
there were 仿und his intestines a
stick, four brass knives, two pi试巧 of
iron, and a quantity ofwool and hairs.
When, therefore, the actuality of
these things is ao obvious to the senses,
it is absurd to argue that because the
matter is strange and difficult it must
be a凸illusion; a$ if anything unheard

that account be unfeasible a打

托ared 化€more confidently do they do
evil; whereas threats and the fear of
imprisonment avail much to force
them to remove their spells. This was
fully and clearly admitted at Serre in
December 1586 by Claude Morelc,
who said that nothing so effectively
compelled him to cure the ills which
he had caused as the fear of arrest
or the threat of blows or some violence.
There was a certain man who, on
account of his wide knowledge and
experience, was admit化d ^nto the
inner councils of our Most Serene
Duke. I was talking with him of this
matter, when in all seriousness he told
me the following:— It had been told
him that his little son had suddenly
been taken sick, and that it was
thought that a certain old woman had
caused this by witchcraft. O打heai*ing
this, he first of all closely questioned
the nurse, who had been carrying the
child whe打 the sickness attacked Wm.
Then he C O 打
sidcred and examined in
every detail the nature of the sickness,
whether or not it was 0打
e to which a
child of that age would naturally be
liable; and when he had decided
beyond doubt that it could not have
been caused except by some evil art
or spell, he concluded, after weighing
the whole matter very carefully in his
m ind,化at 化ere was no化ing left fbr
him to believe but that it was the old
woman who had caused his son，s sick*
n巧 He therefore summoned her to
him, and when she was alone with
him in the house spoke to her at first
with much gentleness, asking her, if
she knew of any remedy for the sick^
打
ess, not to begrudge applying it，
化r
she would not fin在 him ungra化flU.
But when he saw that she began to be
very voluble in her efforts to remove
all suspicion from herself, and obstin-
a化ly denied 化汪t she knew any remed*
ics, he took up a cudgel which he had
ready, and so oelabourcd hershoulders
and f^nks that she said she would do
what he asked. She only asked a
little time to get together what was
required. This was at once granbd,
and she was given permission to do
what seemed good to her to the sick
child; and very soon, by the applica­
tion of certai打 matters, which were
rather a blind to cover her witchcraft
than of any virtue in thcmsclvcsj she
restored him 化 his former health.
My friend Antemius Blycnstcm,
TTrcasurcroftheProvinceofDommar-
tin, once told me that the same thing
had happened to one of his sons.
•'Childlike，，， he said，" 化c boy had
wandered away from his mother and
was playing about i打church, when an
old woman came by and stroked his
head as if ;n blessing, and a化
cr wish­
ing him well went out by the door.
At once 化e boy，s head drooped, he
could hardly stand, and his crying
made it clear that he was sick. When
he was taken home and his sickness
grew worse every hour, there was no
doubt in the minds of all who had
heard what had happened that it had
bcc打caused by that old woman, who
was already suspected of ma打
y ac技 of
witchcraft. Therefore she was forcibly
brought to my house by some of the
neighbours to undo the evil which she
ha芽 done; and as soon as she was in
the boy*s presence she began to be
affliclcd in the same way as he; for her
whole face went livid and she foamed
at the mouth, so much to the spccta-
tor's horror that she seemed about to
go mad. On the following night she
asked to He in the same bed with the
boy, put her arms all about him and
her mouth to his mouth, as if she
meant to res化re hi$ health by her
warnUh a打
d brea化. And 化c women
who were watching said that they
heard alwuc the boy a bu艺
zine such
as gadflies make in summer， umH there
disappeared from view a fragment ofa
Go命 I 化x【 which had been sewn on
to his pillow for an amulet; but they
could not 化11whether the witch or her
Ikmon did this. Bu( it was certain
that the boy^ who the day before had
been Aought at death，$door, was per­
fectly well and strong by dawn.
Yet the witch did not labour for

nothing; for to repay herself for that
good deed she shortly afterwards be­
witched and killed the greater part of
the cattle which were stabled at that
hou化 •，•
There arc many pohi技 worthy of
observation in this story. First, not
eve打 the hoHn巧s and sanctity of a
church takes from witches the will and
the power to do €vil， unless God in
His especial goodness forbids and pre­
vents them. We have already given
an example of this; where a whch
during the 巧cred office fatally
spri打
kled with an aspc巧e a girl whom
sne had been unable to injure in any
other way. More than o打
ce we have
化en the images of Saints broken and
cast down in their shrines by lightning,
believed to have been directed against
化cm by some Demo打
. For nowhere
do the Demons more love to perpe-
tra化 their ;n;quitics than where their
hideousnessisenhancedandirUensi-
fled by contempt.
Scco打
dly, they like to di巧uise their
malefactions under the pretext of a
benediction. When Joab was about
to slay Amasa with a sword, he em-
braced him i订 friendly fashion and
said: "Art thou in health， my
brother?*^ (II. Sam. xx, 9). And
Judas (whom the harmonizers of the
Oid and New Tes化meiUs makeJoab’s
>arallel) saluted his Master with a
[is3, which the mark of the greatest
friendship among the Jews, when he
wa*s about to deTiver 扫im to be tor*
化 red and put 化 death by His execu­
tioners. It is, moreover, the custom of
sorcerers to use in their charms and
incantations holy images^ solcnm
prayers， and even the i打品able Name
of God Himself. Finally^ it is no new
thing, according to Aulus Gellius*

d unadul化ra化d; but
always has to be paid for by its reci­

driven a sickness from one man than
they immediately transfer it to some
other; and one man^s safety is always
purchased a( the expense of another's
destruction. S. Gr巧 ory o f T our, in
his //打化rifl fVaworu而, VI, 35, trfls
how this fact was exemplified by ccr-
tain witches of Pai*is who, after having
by their evil spell brought a mortal
sickness upon the Prefect Mummol,
could by no other means restore him
to health than by winning his consent
to the death of the two-year-old son ^

The historians of ancient times arc
full of examples of this transference of
evils wrought by men s化eped in
devilish error. For instance, when
Adme化s was King at Pherae，
Apo"o
obtai打
ed from the Fa化s a compact
with Death that he should be spared
if another could be found (o die for
him. And when a great chas瓜 呼 ened

highest hope had leaped into it. And
here ;t is profitable to remark upon
the wide difference between the
fatherly goodness of God and the
tyrannical cruelty and harshness of
tile Devil; for God turns the misfor­
tunes of men to their own safety and
salvation; whereas the Devil, when-
ever it lies i打 his power, turns their
prosperity to sure calamity and des­
truction*
Fourthly, it should be noted that,
with the greatest mockery and con^
tempt， wuches ape and copy the
methods employed by Elisha, ^ ia h ,
S. Paul, and many of ihc Holy Fathers
in reckling men to life; for they
s化e化h themselves Umb fbr limb upon
the sick and embrace them with their
whole body. I have already sta化d at
some leng山 that Satan is the grea巧St
copier and imita化r of 化c works of
God.

promptly and thoroughly. But when
the necessary iiuerval haa clapped and
there was no longer any fear of the
plague again broking out, and she
nad b e e D paid her money and given
leave to depart, she was sorry to have
to leave so good and geocrous a way

and decided to find some means of
delaying her departure; and thought
that her best plan would be to bring
some sickness upon the Castellan's
wife> since she had been so precipitate
in dismissing her. So she at once
decided to afflicc her with some illness^
so that she would again be hired to
stay and heal i t She accordingly went
forthwith to the woman*s bedroom
and, standing at the door, said：
*‘Look, your stay-laces are u打

Let me tie them for you.** And, while
doing her this apparent service, she
cleverly shook down the back of her

had in her Hand. At once the woman
was seized with a violent trembling
of her limbs, such as occun at the
onset of a high fever; and soon she
was a巧ic化d with such pain in the feet

means; for from the very moment that
they had threa化ned to beat her she
bad secretly administered an antidote^
but had not been able to prevent the
sickness &〇化 continuing for ;ts
allotted time. Let them wait until
two weeks to the hour had passed
from the time of the onset of the sick*
ness; fbr the打 without doubt the sick
woman would recover and be freed
from all pai打；托cling nothing worse
than a weariness of the limbs. And
this predkdon was not falsified, fbr at
the very time which he had named the
pain was assuaged* But on the follow*
ing night it reUirned with even grea化r
violence; for^ as it was afterwards dis*
cove化d, the witch had reperued of
having cured her because she saw that
by doing so she had provided an
oipportunity for brineiog a charge of
witchcraft against herself, together
with indisputable evidence of the
fact; for it has already been shown
that such sicknesses ca打 hardly be
cured or assuaged except by the witch
who cau化d them; and fbr this reason
she repeated and renewed the poison*
When, therefore, on the next day they
cha巧ed her son wi化 the falsity of his
)rcdiction> he cursed much u打
dcr his
wreath, but would only say that they
must beat his menher unmercifully,
化r that was the only remedy for h灯

ts did not cease to
hammer and kick and pound and
shake her, and finally to drag her to
the fire, until she gave her promise to
heal the sick woman at that very hour.

d this promi化 she fulfilled, giving
her to cat an apple which she had in

leave to depart as she had before been
promked, and fell into the hands of
the officers ofjustice who were waiting
for her at the castle ga化• By these,
at the command of theJudge who had
inquired into her life and behaviour,
she was arres化d and vhrown into
prison, where she soon confessed

There are two chief lessons which
wc can learn from this story- First,
that the remedies appiicd by witches
for the sicknesses they have caused
have no curative power in themseWes,
but arc a iTitre cover to the spells
which, from fear of the law^s severity,
they da巧 not use openly. Thus 化 cy
use herbs and ungue打
ts and lotions
and other things of cverysiay use, in
which there is no particular medicinal
value. O r dsc it is thdr del化 era化
purpose to s化ep men*s minds in
superstition; as whe打 th巧 persuade
them to undertake with specious piety
votive pilgrimages, nine days^ aevo-
tion2, lustrations, offerings, and other
$uch exercises as are daily used by
Christians. Or, finally, their intention
is to undermine and destroy the faith
and trust which we should place
God alone, by causing us t
it to some ai'tick of food or drink
stolen from the wkch，s house, and by
eating which wc trust to be recovered
from the illness with which we arc
suffering. F o r【hese beldams willingly
perm U 【his to be done, even to the
extc打
t of great damage to their house­
hold，so long as they ca打 implant i打
the common mind the base 打
odon that
they have at their command, as it
were from an apothecary's workshop,
an infallible cure for their diseases.
Nay (as Pliny the Younger says), they
thus claim to have control over ihe
Gods in their own houses, so that they
alone arc able to help and protect the
rest of the human race.
Secondly, wc must not neglect to
ncUe how this story exempi吊cs the
truth that the Demon，s hands are so
148 D E M O N O L A T R Y BK.
tenacious that he does not easily allow
anything to be taken from him which
he has o打
cc laid hold 〇
£ Therefore,
ir at the request of his disciples he has
afflicted anyone with a disease, it
usually happens that this must be
exchanged for an even worse sickness,
as has already been said; or its cure
and easement must be delayed dll a
certain time which cannot antici*
化ted, however much 化e witch may
》eseech him to do $
〇
• Thus there must
always remain something which the
Demo打ca打count as his gain. But let
us proceed with the relation of other
examples.
Stephan Noach of Castel-nuit (July
1586) for three years continuously

brtune-teller said that the sickness

woman whom he would find ta化mg
to his wife on his return home; and
that he must weave a chain of pliant
twigs and throw it over her neck as
soon as he came into her pre巧nce>and

him to health. Accordingly, he came
home and found sitting witk his wife

fell before his knees and b^ged him
to pardon her, and promised for sure
that she would hca him completely
from all his infirmity if he would but
do what she told him to do. This
was, first that he should make no
difficulty about eating a pear which
she would give him; for although at

two picked matrons from the neigh-
bournood to keep wa化h over him
that night. The vile woman meant to
protect he口d f by 化e presence of these
two women, in gase she were accused
of witchcraft when so long and grave
an illness should be so easily and
quickly cured; for it was by 打
o means
her imemion to do openly that which
she was to do. Noach declared that
he would refuse no condition as long
as he could be cured of his terrible
di化asc. But when he 化ok the pear,
at n口t he could not get hU 化eth into
it, for it was plainly made ofjron;

coals could hardly have caused him
greater agony. He was hurried into

matrons to watch over him with her

hold, so long as they can implant in
the common m^nd the base 打
oUon that
they have at their command， as it
were from an apothecary's workshop,
an infallible cure for their diseases.
Nay (as PH打
y 化 c Younger says),化巧
thus claim to have control over the
Gods in their own hou化s, so that they
alone arc able to help and protect the
rest of the human race.
Secondly, wc must not neglect to
no化 how this siory cxcmpHfics the
化uth that the Demon，s hands are so
148
tenacious that he does not easily allow
anything to be taken from liim which
he has once laid hold of. Therefore,
if at the request of his disciples he has
afflicted anyone wich a disease, it
usually happens that this must be
exchanged lor an even worse sickness,
as has already been said; or its cure
and ea化ment must be delayed till a
cer巧 in time which cannot DC amici-
记化d, however much the witch may
化seech him to do so. Thus there must
always rem江
in something which the
Demon can count as his gain* But let
us proceed with the relation of other
灼camples.
Ste扣 an Noach of Caste^nuit (July
1586) for three years continuously
wa5 so sick 化at It wan化d litdc to
drive him mad. Being, therefore,
despaired by all, and having tried ;n
vain every remedy which the skill of
his physicians could suggest, he at last
thought of approaching a fortune-
teller. There wa$ at that time at Cran*
ville one who was pre-eminently
famous in that w , and to him in
>erson he told his whole trouble. The
ortune•化Iler said that the sickness
lad been brought upon him by the
woman whom he would find talking
to his wife 0打 hk re化rn home; and
that he must weave a chain of pliant
twi护 and throw over her iKck as
$00打as he came into her prese打
cc>and
fiercely threaten to 巧ra日
glc her at
once unkss she immedia化
ty restored
him to health. Accordingly, he came
home and found sitting with his wife
by the hearth an old woman named
Pariseta of NcuvUlc, and, as he had
been told, terrified her by word and
deed as much as he could. She then
fell before his knees and begged him
to pardon her, and promised for sure
th还
t she would hea him completely
打om all his infirmity if he would but
do what she told him to do. This
was, first that he should make ao
difficuhy about eating a pear which
she would give him; for although at
first womd seem to be as hard as
stone, yet after he had rubbed a

little i打hU ha打
ds it would become as
soft as if it had been thoroughly well
cooked* Then he must go straight to
bed; ibr his sickness wou d then auack
him violently, even to the point of
dea化 ； and 化e巧fore he must c江
H in
two picked matrons from 化c neigh-
bournood to keep wa化h over him
that 打
ight. The vdc woman meant to
protect herselfby the presence of these
two women, !n gasc sne were accused
of whchcraft when so long and grave
an illness should be so easily and
quickly cured 5for it was by no means
her intention to do openly that which
she was to do. Noach declared that
he would refu巧 no condition as long
as he could be cured of his terrible
disease. But when he took the pear,
at 打
rst he could not get his teeth into
it， for it was plainly made o f如〇11;
but even as he was saying so, and in
the mea打
time rubbing it a little wUb
his hands, he fbu打
d to his surprise
that it had become as soft as wool*
He ate it (and it was most nauseous
to the taste), and at once felt such a
burning heat in his belly that red-hot
coals could hardly have caused him
grea化r agony. He was hurried
bedj to an appearance breathing hb

matrons to watch over him with her

his health. But 化e witch chid him
for hi$ tardiness, and more and more

with the wi化h， they asked why he had

th e m ,打苗ed and unaccompanied*
The wkch took care to answer first,
saying: "Can you not see that I
brought him Kere to empty his
bow冰 ?" But they did not stop to
bandy words with her» their only care
being to take the man up and get Wm
back to bed as quickly as possible;
yet all o f them together could hardly
manage this by putting forth their
every effort, whereas the witch had
easily carried him out by herself. Now
whereas the chief conaidon o f their
agreement had been that Noach>
auer he had performed all the above,
should be entirely cured of his disease^
yet there still remained no little pain.

that the sickness would last for ano化er
eight days at the most, after which his
health would be complc化ly res化red
without any further cisapi^intment.
And so it proved. Being apprehended
on the clear evide打
cc 0打his and many
otiier crimes, she was at last put in

of her wardresses, she broke gaol and
escaped.
In this tale also there are points not
unworthy of the reader’s attention.
First, that among Christian men of
our day scK>ch$ayers confidently and
with impunity live and practise their
art; altnough all men whose souls
have been imbued with a knowledge
of the true God have banished them
from the society of men. Moses {LeviL
XX. 6 and DeuL xviii, xi), Saul (i Sam.
xxviii. 3} and Josiah (11. xxiii.
24) pronounc品 the extreme pe打

sword. At the Councils of Ancyra*
(cap. 24), Toledof (cap. 28) and
Orleans! (cap. 32), amoi^ many
others, the Holy Fathers decreed that
they were to be cx;termina化d 行
om

has bee打finally agreed by aU Chris*

men and summon them to tliem fbr

people, more confident to
such aiuhorUy, fbliow their example.

of the Emperor Trajan that, when he

would return to Rome, the Demon
replied that he must bring into his
temple a vine wand spHt into two and
covered with a handkerchief, and take
it out agai打on the day after the mor­
row. And although m this case it
seems to be more concerned with
历化化ry questions and au|^ri巧, yet
it sug另巧ts that there is in the wood of
the vine some peculiar qual每 which
is lacking in other woods. This was
ob化rved by Euphorion,§ who said
that formerly it was not lav^ul to make
an image of Rhea Dea except fn>m

Suidas testifies, she was otherwise
known as Gybcl^ that is (according

the bear which carried him. For it
the Demon’s chief ai町， when he
wishes to corrupt us, that we should
put tile grea化St confidence him,
and there is always something of this
purpose in all his schemes, so that he
may turn us from the Creator to the
creature and plunge us more deeply
into earthly thoughts. It in con­
nection with 化is that wc see tumblers
and strolling jugglers always leading
bears whh them, upon which, fbr a
fee, they place children in order, for­
sooth, that they may thereafter be
more secure from the fear of hob­
goblins and spectres* We have already

dees, and in the fbUowing chap化r we

and at greater le打
g化《
But before we begin this task and
put an end to this question, it is worth
whUe here to touch upon a maUer
which has been dealt with by many
authors; whether or 打
ot it is possible,
without mortal hurt 化 the soul,化 beg
and petition witches 主
11 this way to
heal our infirmities. Possibly it will be
said that any argumeM about this
quesdon is superfluous after the clear
verdict of so many of the older Theo*
logi&ns, includii^ S. Thomas and
S. Bonaventura, supported by that of
more recent authonties who cannot
be disregarded; but【 have never been
persuaded that 化eir utterances are
so ;a^ired as to admitofnodiscussion.
For it makes 么grcatdj^erencewhether
you take or obtain anything from
another by force or by supplicadpn:
;n one case you show con化m ft and
disdain; in the other, admiration,
obedience, and a humble and sub­
missive spirit of pleading. If a man
begs or bribes a witch to obtain from
her Little Master a cure 仿r the sick,
ness from which he is suffering, then
I think that he does no less than as a
suppliant reverently to implore ihe
D ^ o n for help, to ask to be bound to
him by a ben占 t received, to worship
him an ofTerin取 and 化encore
to confess that he will be subject to

even death itself, should be endured
befbre we allow ourselves to be led
into so horrible a sacrilege. The Holy
Scriptures proclaim aloud that God
alone is to be worshmped and adored ；
for He is a , ealous God, who will not
suffer the g ory and honour which is
due to Him to be paid i
{DeuU vi. 4; S. Matthew 37

that the atrocity of (he crime con-

But all these conditions are ob巧rved

Nevertheless, I unhesitatingly agree
with Abdias^ Bishop of Babylon^ that
the cures apparently wrought by
wUch巧 are not due to the application
of any effective remedy, but merely
rcs?It from the wi化h，s ceasing from
active torment of the sufferer; and I
am chiefly convi打
ced of 化is by the
fact that such cures are often e於 c化d
in a moment without the u巧 of any
medicine, for such a rapid change
from sickness to health cannot seem
at all probable. Therefbre, if a man

fidently and boldly, being clear
in his conscience and 化listing ;n the
help of God, by threats or violence
compels Satan, represe打化d by a
witch, to abstain from injury and
magic 巧 elk, and to cease and refrain
from doing hui% and to depart from
his body (for Iamblichus believed t ^ t
this sort of sickness was nothing but
the pr巧ence of a Demon in 化 e body),
how， I ask, does he act in any way
difTerently from the Exorcists who
bind demoniacs with chains and beat
them and terrify them? But, you wUl
say, it is not so much in this that they
place their hope of saving them, but
far rather in the po化nt words of 化e
Holy Scriptures which they u巧 in

that, in the case o f those others al$o»

and o山er writers o若no mean order，
The Emperor was sitting at his tri*
bimal at Alexandria waiting for the
days of the hot winds to pa巧, when
two men of the common people came
to him asking for the help which had
been indicated to them by Serapis,
One of these men was bH打
d, and the
other had a withered ha打
d ; and they
said that they had been told in a dream
that the blind man would see the light
if Vespasian anointed his eyes wiih
his spittle, and the other man's hand
would be made whole if he were
touched by his heel. It was hardly be­
lieved that this could be so^ and at first
V 巧pasian did n?t dare to put it to the
proof; but his friends ui^cd upon him
that if the cure were accomplished it
would redound to 化e glory of C左

a打
d if not it would only make the two
men ridiculous; so he made 化e experi-
ment in both particular before the
whole assembly. And the result was
that one man had the use of his hand
restored, a打
d the other again rejoiced
in the Jight of day. The truth was that
the Demon whom Egypt, the Mother
of errors, worshipped under the name
of Serapis^ was afraid Jest he should be
ousted from his old scat by the Church

the sickness was not caused by the

Such are among the excuses which
they always offer for their delays and
subterfuges in the matter of healing.
The following examples will make this
clearer,

to be feared, and the remedy to be

Dominigue Euraea, at Charm巧, Nov.
1584^ said that it was impossible to re-*
store a sick man to health unless his
sickness was transferred in an ag^ra-
va化d form to ano化cr, and 化at such
an exchange was ^ways the source of
some grea化r evil. Also that they im*
media化ly lost their powers of healing
given them by the Demon if any priest
or physician nad laid his hands on the
sic^ in an at化mpt to heal him. Alex知
Drigie, at Haraucourt, Nov. 1586, said
that the cure was never a£solu化ly
compk化， but that there always re*
mained some trace of the sickness.
Catharine 丘alandrc, at Ardemont,
Dec. 1584, said that it was in vain to

she was 打

ger uDder the protec­

cures arc made possible. This agrees
wi化 the sta化merit of Nic〇
]e Morde>
at Scire, Jan, 1587, when, being al*
ready a pi^isoner, he was a3ked to cure
the son ofJean Chemat, whom he ad-
mit化d that he had afflicted whh 也€
sickness from which he was suifei*ing;
for he answered that he had lost all
such powers when, by the confession
of his guilt, he had entirely driven hts
Demon from him ^and in any ca化 the
very sanctity of his place of imprison-
me打
t would preve打
i him from using
such powe口；
fbr it was imposs化Ic to
cast spells for a cure in thevery place of
vengeance for the practice ofsuch arts.
This belief must have been in the
mind of Damis when he inferred that
his master, Apollonius of Tyana> was
endowed with divine powers because
he broke the 耗ttc口 from his leg with­

Catharina Gillotia, Huecourt, May

first begged her to heal her. Balial
Basolus， of Saint Nicolas des Preys de
Verdun, Maixh 巧87， and Cokwe
Fischer, of Gerbeville, March 1588,
mentioned a new kind of obstacle >
saying that if a man afflic化d in 化is
way were to make a打
d perform a vow
to any of the Saints without having
told or consul化d wkh ^ein,thi8C〇
n-
化mpt of them preven化d them from
doing an文出ing fuither to heal 出c
sickness. But it must be suspected that
tkis obs化de is a fiction engendered
by their desire for gain or thanks^ for
which they are above all things eager.
For witches make it their chief busi-
n巧s to be asked to perform cures so
that they may reap some profit, or at
least gratitude; since they are for the
most part begga巧
，
who support life 0打
the alms they receive.
加 w the ob巧acks which arc 化U5
said 化 prevent a wuch from curing the
sickness which she has caused are not
altoge比cr "logical or unreasonable.
For in the first ^ace it is not without
desi巧 that the 私 mon pretends that,
directing a cure， he 田。 St have the
help of her (hrough whose agency he
has previously caused the d isc^ . No
one doubts that he could do this alone
and single-handed; but he acts as he
does so that his w^ll-doine may be
diminished and depreciated by placing
the power of performing it at the
pleasure of another; and also that he
may earn a greater reputation with his
disciples for his service to them, when
heshowsthathewUInotwUhoutcon-
suiting them alter anything of which
they have been the authors; for it is
打
o small source of grati6cauon to a
wi化h to know that she h accredited
withpowersoflife and death over man­
kind ; and that when she has cast an
evil spell upon a man, it will not be re-
movra by any other means than^ or
physician or sprUual salvation from a
priest; here aiso there i$some fiaudu-
lent and malicious fiction, since in
neither of those cases ;5 tKe Demon
likely to earn any reward for his cure.
Theraore this OMtacle proceeds rather
from the Demon’s je^ousy and his
fear that he would 护 1 no c i^ it fbr a
cure which would probably be attri*
buted to another agent who had pre*
ceded him. Therelore they take the
greate巧 pains 份 inculcat^ in those
whom they have bewitched with a sick*
n巧》 the belief that they must shun all
remedies, human and divine, if they
wish to recover, and that if they even
think o f having recourse to such
remedies they must certainly lose all
hope o f ever regainiitf their health.
There is always this further modye,
that the Demon wishes to avoid in-
山 咕 巧 the pity of his disciples! if in-
dec5 they arc ever moved by pity^
thirdly, as to their l:^Dg hin*
le fact o f their accusation
and imprisonment, I would not deny
that this is true in the cas« of those who
their sins and by peiU.
tence have Briven the Demon from
them; for then the pact is broken by
the terms o f which they had received
that supernatural power o f healing,
and therefore those powers must
dwindle and vanish. There can be no
more-convincing proofofthis than the
fact that those in that condidem have
no more power to cast injurious spells^
however much they may wish to, not
even upon the very torturers who put
them to the question* &foreover,it has
often been proved that when the
Judge, from a wish to put this matter
to test, by a mere 打
od or a word
dis^ai^es them, they have at once

Demoii*s household as h were by

stupendous prodigies. But if with con-
tu町acious obstinacy they persist in
denying their guilt; or if they do not
in so many words and after the cus­
tomary form forswear the society of
the Demo打a打
d renege his friendship,
or rather abjure their fealty to him and
shake off his yoke: in that case I
should say that their allegation is false,
that they are no longer able to do
anything under his auspices, particu­
larly ifit is a matter of restoring a man
to health. For even when they are in

a hope of freedom, give them their

a打
d arc in every respect 江

i打
dulgent and fielpflil to them as th巧
ever were before: so that it is not
likely that they would refb化 to heal a
sickness for them if they asked them,
and if it were safe fbr them to make
such a requ巧t. Moreover: it is foolish
to say that the wiKh prevented by
his chains, while the Demon, who has
no need of the witches co-operation, is
in 打
0 way bound or in chains. A^d
there is no Judge who would think of
putting any o除 acle or hindrance in
the way of so 巧Iiaary a deed, h lay
at all within his discretion.

the Apparitor, who was then present,
persuaded the Judge to have her ar­

o fthis while she was still at liberty, and
ui^ed her to take some vengeance on
the Apparitor for that injury, saying
that lie would gladly undei^takc the
execution of it if she asked him. She
agreed, and he at once flew 【0 (he Ap*

cd his arm violently as if in
anger and, to 化e great astoni油 ment
of all who were present, it was imme­
diately made sound again; and after
having been for many months power­
less and useless, it became in a moment
vigorous and capable of performi凸
g all
its usual functions as b^ore. Tbis led
to a strong suspicion that she main*
tained her association with her Little
Mas化r to the very last; for though she
had often been urged to abjure h;m
she had refused to do so» saying that it
was imposs化le to reject one whom you
had never admilted* There have been
other wUches w h o,化ough in prison,
have prescribed the use of herbs and
louons and unguents and other such
remedies, saying that their application
to the sick would not be without re«
suit.
Lastly^ the benefit of such cures is
D E M O N O L A T R Y
qualified cither by some lasting trace
of the sick打
MSj or often by its 打ansfer-
cnce with even grea化r pain and 化!*-
men【 to another* This is but another
iUust巧tion of 化c 杠ct which wc have
already so often pointed out, that the
Demon never allows his prey to be
犯atched 〜 holly from his hands，but
that there must always be something
as the price and reward of his work.
Thus when he emers into a pact to
serve and work for a man (on which
account he is commonly called the
man^s familiar spirit), he takes care
that the chief CO打
dition of the pact
shail be that within a sta化d time he
shall be free to find a new master^ or
else to do what he will with his pr的ent
master. It was by this conditio打that
he had bou打
d the fa化er of that Ger-
man whom 1 mentioned m the story
of M^llot. And when the day for its
fulfilment was imminent, and he could
find no one who would rid him of so
amiable a 化rvant> he was finally com­
pelled to transfer that pernicious put
to his 0打
ly son. The son had to renew
the unholy compact of alliance; but he
was gra打化d a shorter period of dme
beforMhe la产e of whitA he must 行
nd
another to taW his place in the coils of
that pact, or himself perish and fall a
prey to the hunter. And so it hap-
pc打
cd to that German. For whe打the
wretched man could find 打
o one to re­
lieve him, as it were, at his post of
wa化h, not even Maillot, who had
given Wm some hope, in the end as he
was journeying through Italy with his
master， aUhough he was on the alert
地 d his horse did not even stumble, he
was thrown and instantly killed.

A
S wc have said i打the la巧 chap化r,
the culmination of this abomin-
ablc crime is that, after 打
early a whole
lifedme of sacril^e and wickedness^
wiichcs cut ofTthe Utde 化at remains to
them by laying violent ha打
ds upon
化emselves, and at last put an ever-
names
put
lasting end to an execrable life; and so
tho化 whom he has in their lives
s化eped i打crime, the Demon brings to
eter打
al punishment in their deaAs.
Thu is clearly illustrated by the ca^c
of Didier 長
inance, Sレ D成 July 巧另I,
"pOQ whom, because hissorceries w re
aggravated by parridde, the College
of the Duumvin of Nancy pronounced
the exceptionally^ seve托巧凸化ncc that
he should be burned with red-hot
tongs and then be placed alive on the
fire. Whether he was informed of this
by his Demon, as we shall la化r show to
have hap戶eped to certaia othc巧， or
whether It was fore巧en by his own
conscience ofso 化订化Ic a enme, he de，
termined to e化ape this 巧n化nee by
seeking his own death. Therefore he
took a kn报 which had carelessly been
left in the bread chest by one of the

as he could, a打

Therefore it is that he does not Wm巧

against their will, nor hang them with
a rope from a beam,nor them with
a knife ；but only urees them to take
these courses in their mad打巧s. But

抒om the following examples,
Jeanne le Ban in 0於 n confession
bore witness that her Demon was in
nothing so importunate as in his efforts
to persuade her to throw herself into
a weil, or drown herself in a river, or
hang herself with a rope, or destroy
h er^ f by some means or other* And
it was ;mposs化le 化 say how often she
had 巧art苗 to do $

herself forcibly prevented in the very
act) like one who s说s a morsel of food
snatched from his lips. But even after
that she had not ceased 红om her at*
tempts, and after her imprisonment
she had- i)iirned with：
a desire to kill
herself and had redoubled her efforts
to do so. And thac she might not have
the excu化ofthe ミ

deed, the Demon had shown her a for*

corner of her prise打

and she would have ca打ie<) k out; but
she was prevented from completing her
purpose by the fact that she could find

court, Dec. 1583, when Alexia Gallaea
ofBcroncourt was eager to disclose her
crimes to the Judge But could not be-
cau巧 （so she sai巧 of the presence of
her Demon, she asked that her hair
might be cut off a打
d thrown on C

once began toenumera化all the a*imes

auspices and leadership. It may be
that the Demon, who is always a base
imita化r of God's works, in this also
tries to copy that which we read of
Samson in the Bible; how he had been
forbidden from Heaven to cut 0任hh
hair he wished to keep intact the
s【rcng化 which God had given him，
for the seat of this was his hair.
Others a^ain think that by throwing
cold wa化r in the witch，s face they can
drive aw ^ the Demon* Rosa Gcrar-
dine, at 哮say, Nov, r586, confessed
that by this alone was she brought to

coercing her meant nothing to hen

approval of many who have used it,
and was witnessed this very year by a

SErenger and Kramer (施 化 她 •
Uf. Pt. Ill, Quest-15) mention another
method which they had ob化rved;
namciy> that the wi化h must be
broueht ^nto the presence of herJudge
whh her 位cc averted from him. For it
is argued that if the wi化h can get but
the merest glance at him at the first,
she ca打 fill his mind with pity for her,
or rather ca打bewi化h him, just as the
basilisk or even the wolftries to get the
6 円 t glance at a ma打 ：
"The wolves saw Mocris first,";
Now if 化c cause of all these
be carefully considered, none more
probable, I 化ink, will 占 found than
that the Demon purposely offers the
occasion for such experiments, and so
provides the ma化rial, as it werCy by
which men arc the more easily led to
tempt God; fbr so th巧 do when 化ey
pass over and neelcct the remedies
which lie to their Hands, and turn to
strange and unwo打化d remedies which
have the Demon as their author and
su媒 estor* For this is the grossest im­
piety, and it was fbr this that God
formerly punished the Isradites with
fiery serpents; a打

in g 【he journey the report of

meaner men if th«y did not know from
experience that it was a fact* Can we

That the Demons ca打in the bKefest

lamour
cast by the Demons, by which they
delude the $ight of those alone whom
they will, leaving that of all the others
free and ua挺ttered. Opticians tell US
that our capacity fbr seeing anything
depe打

intermedia化 air, and 也at 血 s raises
our power of vision from potentiality
to actuality* now the Demons can at
control both light and darkness.
For God gave them power over the air
{Ephesians, ii, 2), therefbre no one
ought to doubt that they have the
power to makt themselves visible or
invisible to each man as they wish:fbr,

I 出ink that m such matters we shouid
give more weight to the opinion of one
who had given much thought and
study to the subject of these occult arts.
For>says Cicero, De DiuinatiorUyLib* II,
he used Co ascribe such virtue to the
inspection of the in化mal organs that，
from their condition and colour, he
held it possible to prefigure the plenty
or deal•化 of the earth?s harvest, aua
the salubrity or the reverse of the air
which surroimds u s ; 仿r it must be

，
However this may be, our daily
experience, confirmcci by the ample
authority of ma打

this CO打
elusion; that when the Demons
assume some bodily form, they have
nevertheless the power to make them^

darlm w and light are 仍 a great extent

not to seem wonderful that 化ey can

whom Sa化n has caught in the coils

s than either a
forced or a spontaneous confession
before the J u d g e ,化Mowed by the

does that Master keep upon his sub*

remission of punishment in the case of
those whom such mercy would prob­

tha打induce 在em to amend their lives.
And Plato in his Protagoras says that
the purpmc ofpunishing the guilty was
not to avenge their enmes (for who
ca打undo that which is done?), but to
serve as a de化打ent to prevent one
who has si。

ed from committing that
crime again. Then what sufficient
argument can be adduced to show
that such scum who vow eternal
allegiance to the Devil should not be
put to de辽
th with every torment as
soon as their guilt is known? For if a
thing becomes a danger to the public,
and this danger cannot be removed
without loss to him who owns this
thing, yet it Ujust that he should bear
that loss i打the imercsts of the public;
for the peace and safety of the &ub]ic

This Plutarch tells us was the 杠化 of
Pericles and Aristides the Just.
And yet we find those who would
defend old women, who are a menace

of the evil bewitchments which

and finally would be revered on ac­

encouraging them to even grea化r
licence in lU-doing. But may be
argued that there is no sufficient proof
to warrant bringing these women to
trial on so grave a charge: that it is
against all law and justice to give such
weight to a popular fear or a $care bred
of an u打
certain rumour, as to think it
nee巧巧ry to put a feHow乂feature to
an ig打
ominious death i打order to allay
that 拓ar. I answer that there can be
no question of calum打
y in these cases;
for no one ca打quote a single instance
of anyone being put to death for this
crime who has not first been manifestly
proved guilty either by the clear evi-
dcncc of witnesses or by her own
persistent confession up to the time of
her death.
But now they fall back upon hy far
their strongest une ofdefence; which is
that the law does not punUh a man
except for a crime which he had wi^
tingly and intentio打

a打
d that no化ing could so completely
preclude any such i打

be no doubt about the cunning con-
trivances and deceptions and "Gisions
by which he so secfuces them; $〇that
it is scarcely in tiie power of anyone，

so difficult, absurd and unjust that

These argumc打

this were merely a mat化r of settling a

that they were of a shameful nature,
or that they were deliberately and
maliciously designed to cheat one of

no one could fulfil however much he

And that such contracts can be draw打

Moreover, if any of the conditions

his great powers stands by him and
willingly helps him. Lastly^ a base or

more invalidates it than a robber is
