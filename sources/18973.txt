you
well these objects kept coming over at
the flying same kind of formation that
we fly in our fighters we&#39;re flying in
Germany
and we were flying f80 sexes and they
would come over and do the same
maneuvers that we make except they&#39;re
ones while one I&#39;m gonna go she&#39;s hip
and you just can&#39;t do that in a fighter
conventional fighter missile radar was I
was on vision you can see him from what
start it was the weatherman was trying a
weather balloon he saw these dogs with
his binoculars and so uh that started
people getting out looking at him and
then we decided to put some airplanes up
and see what they were but we couldn&#39;t
get the couldn&#39;t get them they were
higher and faster so we couldn&#39;t tell
whether they were large and a long ways
away or whether they were smaller and
closer in they felt the gauge what
they&#39;re exactly what their side
they were definitely in formation well
here was this in 51 about 1951 the
Russians had that kind of technology
back there no so well how close would
you say you might have gotten so if you
definitely termen the Dewar objects I
don&#39;t around house in the control or was
it well yeah they weren&#39;t this random
they were flying they&#39;re flying fighter
formations very definitely under
positive control they&#39;re just typical
saucer shape double integral italic
bucking I think they were definitely
piloted vehicles each one with the pilot
in it and very definitely in
communication with one another because
they would have flights and more than
then four they did flights in maybe 12
or 16 all crying when they make a turn
they&#39;d cross the flights in under and
they had to be in communication to be
coordinated yeah everyone why one would
zip off the side just do a lateral
maneuver they were out to the side much
is easier much as you&#39;ve ever seen the
lights the the UFOs that they found over
Clear Lake California scene they found
now set they&#39;re in formation also long
ago I think they were actually trashed
her pilots flying no doubt about it
well that was I was found I was having
some the cameraman film the installation
of a precision landing facility we were
putting in right on the edge of the dry
lake and the saucer flew right over and
put down three little gear and landed
out on the dry lake bed and they went
out the picked up their cameras and
moved on out to our diem filming and he
left it off put the gear back in the
well and climbed out a very high rate of
speed and disappearing and so all I was
going through all the regulation books
and finding out the number to call in
Washington to report it
I had them go over and develop a film
the time they got back with the
developed film I was on the higher and
higher and higher level officer talking
to me anyway the colonel telling me do
you know when the film arrived at my
desk to put it in the carrier pouch
there would be occurred there at my
office by that time already and they&#39;d
arranged for him to fly in our base
airplane back to Washington with these
films and do not run prints etc etcetera
etcetera we stuck them in the courier
pants did you watch the film we didn&#39;t
have a chance to run it I had a chance
to hold it up to the wind and look at it
it&#39;s certainly good found good close-up
shots good close-ups John nothing like
I&#39;d ever seen double aunt Eckler shade
saying didn&#39;t have a coupon or anything
he was pretty much the same basic show
but this time I was involved in the
research and development and doing very
classified programs myself you know at
the test center so I need that we didn&#39;t
have any vehicles of that kind and I was
99.9 percent sure that the Russians
didn&#39;t have any of that type either so
it certainly there were certainly was at
that point in time there was no doubt in
my mind that this vehicle was made at
some other place than here on earth he
sent it on just like you are today and
you know do what did it tell you what
what they tell you today you know I was
working at the time I was working on a
little program that nobody knew about we
were not allowed to discuss with our
family and discuss with anybody that was
the UT programs so it was in the same
category really in my opinion I think
they were worried that they would panic
the public if they knew that someone had
this kind of performance way back right
after World War two period of time so
they started telling lies about it and
then I think they had to cover another
law you know and tell another lie to
cover their first line now they don&#39;t
know how to get out of now it&#39;s going to
be so embarrassing to admit that all
these administrations have have told a
lot of untruths that it&#39;s going to be
embarrassing to get out on it do you
think they want to get out of it well I
think basically each and every president
would probably like to get out of would
like to come clean on the deal and not
have to continue to tell this truth
eventually when there&#39;s going to be
something happen that it will make all
them have egg all over their face and
they&#39;re going to have to admit the bit
you know they haven&#39;t been truthful at
all I have a good friend who&#39;s a
commercial airline pilot he&#39;s had about
the three there indicator ones pull
right up alongside his wing and set in
formation with him and he&#39;s on a major
airline and it with the airline as a
policy that their careers don&#39;t ever
talk about UFO McDevitt had one sighting
you know and on each never fly you and
your flight plan it was out whenever
our everyday hour minute and second in a
certain time particular time if you look
at the certain degree asmath at a
certain elevation you would see a bright
object or see some kind of object
because we track all this space debris
and so we knew we ran off what would be
in what you&#39;d expect to see but he saw
this one thing shining out there there
was not listed on his space debris chart
so he decided to get a picture of it and
he did he got a picture of it but of
course it was bright metallic and just
it blended so that all you got or just
the bright Glen you can&#39;t really tell
him to tell us what he was and then he
didn&#39;t he he saw it for a few minutes
they tracked it got the one picture of
it but nobody knew what he was well
somebody&#39;s kept it pretty secret for
quite a while anything well I think
darling the early teens my and I think
everybody changed you know on
spaceflight some extent but I think
probably the biggest the biggest
influence it had was it was it&#39;s a real
humbler because when you look at this
beautiful big universe that God has
created for us and you realize here
about that part of it yeah it makes you
feel just about that big
sure-sure takes one down you know
actually we&#39;re very favorably received
at the end and Kurt Waldheim was very
interested in he agreed and he thought
it&#39;d be a good idea to form a committee
and to do the investigation at that
level but nothing ever got done kind of
typical of the Union you know it was
they talked a good game but never got
around do anything about it by NASA&#39;s
own figures there are some 400,000 other
planets out there they could be
habitable and I just can&#39;t believe it
God would habitate this one planet on
and leave all you know it burn in my
personal opinion based on no facts at
all I just feel that we&#39;re out here in
the hinterland of all the galaxies way
out in the stick and the lot of these
other galaxies are closer to one another
and I think they probably have a lot of
travel being wrong you know once in a
while we&#39;ll get a few traveller and
stragglers or more distant ones coming
through from distant other galaxies we
should form a group at the UN level to
start gathering information from around
the world and when the sightings and
information and investigations actually
let it be handled in coordinator in that
level because there were a lot of
countries that had information and there
are a lot of countries like Russia and
now the Government of Russia now works
directly with the civilian UFO groups
any you have a difference from country
to country to country but have all this
information come together and be
correlate in one place we&#39;d really be in
benefit that&#39;s really trying to
determine what is real and what is fake
just thinking about what we can do from
a technical point of view some of them
may be remotely operated they may be
radio-controlled so to speak like we
call unmanned pilot unpiloted vehicles
someone may be there I think some of
them under me have crews and
other people and in my opinion I think
those papers are probably very similar
to us do you think they recovered it one
of those sauces easy so very likely and
I think definitely there was something
other than weather blame there but I
think the truth has been very submerged
in all the lies that have been told I&#39;d
like to think they reversed in in there
and it did something with it you know
did some benefit with it which would be
the logical thing to Dave
is that did you ever try to did you know
where that footage went of the funds
also landed on the time I went the other
thing and that&#39;s all and I know did you
ever keep in touch with anybody about it
or discuss how would I keep in touch
with anybody about it
there&#39;s no way within the military or
within the government of keeping track
or something that is classified
unless you&#39;re directly involved in it
and I was not so I had no end knowing
what happened was it included in part of
the project Bluebook investigation no it
was not and that was one of the
complaints I had about Project Blue Book
which in my opinion Project Blue Book
was still totally a whitewash there were
a number of other things on Blue Book
that that I had occasion to know about
that were not including Blue Book either
well that was one of the reason we did
the UT program the way we did it was
because input no classifications all
along and when you classify a program
then a congressman or senator think they
can go out and tell the whole details
you know they&#39;re privileged to be able
to do that
totally Trempealeau over security and
tell the details about whoever they want
they didn&#39;t classify it all and then
took Gary until cars were shot down
we&#39;re already didn&#39;t know about UT or at
least in the United States
my opinion I think they are coming from
some other planet I think that no doubt
in my mind I think they&#39;re for real I
think eventually we&#39;ll we&#39;ll find out
that there&#39;s a regular travel here on
this earth from other planet I think we
have a lot a lot of potential learning
from if we just set up the schedule and
how to go about doing it I think there
just doesn&#39;t seem as we are just a
little higher a little further a little
faster and they can come laying in my
backyard anytime they want to come and
live out here on I&#39;d welcome to ready so
they came out to the plane but prior to
that this just hovered over the plane
for a short period of time and they just
vanished
we were told lighters that it was picked
up on radar it wasn&#39;t as if you actually
saw it glide away it was like like a
whisk it was gone
