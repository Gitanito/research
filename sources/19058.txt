those objects and that newly
declassified US Navy footage that you
just saw joining me now is dr. Steven
Greer founder the UFO disclosure project
dr. Greer the Pentagon just be
classified these videos though they&#39;ve
been previously leaked what&#39;s the
explanation what were those objects well
they&#39;re actually two is continued again
Laura I was on your show when you met a
radio show bruza cope yes I remember
there are two types of objects one are
classified aerospace devices this is a
letter from Ben rich Lockheed skunkworks
that he wrote in 1986
he described there are two types one or
extraterrestrial vehicles the other our
advanced anti-graft
us classified projects now the leak of
this film actually happened back in 2017
and it&#39;s interesting because there&#39;s a
documentary we&#39;ve just released that&#39;s
number one on iTunes called Close
Encounters of the fifth kind that goes
into the background on this leak which
actually was not a leak it was released
by people who were part of what you
often refer to sort of an authoritarian
transnational group that is trying to
create a specter of some kind of threat
from space which actually does not
because when you look at the speed of
these objects in the Atlantic I said
that the size and speed of the UFO show
that it&#39;s like 40 feet long when they
analyzed it it went from 28,000 feet to
sea level so it&#39;s really fast it means
it was capable of achieving a velocity
of at least 23,000 864 miles per hour 31
times the speed of sound 20 times faster
than an f-18 is that possible or you are
you disputing that no that&#39;s completely
correct you know my uncle designed a
lunar module with the first man on the
moon as you know and and so these these
sort of technologies have been
classified
very long time there are a lot of people
who pretend like there&#39;s not much done
on this and the tragedy is that these
sort of technologies have been explored
and discovered and would benefit the
humanity greatly if they were disclosed
but there are a lot of people who want
to control the status quo they don&#39;t
want that out that yes we have radar
tracings for example in the disclosure
project the trace of these objects
moving in in excess of two hundred
thousand kilometers an hour much faster
than this one and so there&#39;s no question
that these are legitimate actual objects
the technology and physics behind them
are actually quite well understood but
they have been sort of this whole thing
it&#39;s been hijacked Gordon Cooper who was
one of the early astronauts and I
presented to the Federalist Society a
number of years ago this problem that
there is an anti constitutional project
that has kept this secret in defiance of
many of the people in our government
when i briefed the CIA director and the
head of the Defense Intelligence Agency
they tried to find out about this and
we&#39;re being denied access so this is
both a scientific and a policy
constitutional crisis Wow dr. Greer
there&#39;s a lot to unpack there it&#39;s wild
I think my kids and I watched it about I
don&#39;t know 50 times thank you for
joining us you look at those encounters
of the fit behind this documentary
you&#39;re gonna see we&#39;ll check it out
thank you doctor
