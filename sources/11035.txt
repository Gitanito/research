I don't remember very much. I do remember being in the hospital and being brought into a room. I was there only a few minutes, or so I thought.  I remember being aware that my chest was feeling different from usual.   I also remember that, at the time, I was wondering if it was my body that I was looking down on because I was also looking around and seeing no one. I said, 'Um hum, I don't know where everyone is but something is happening here. I don't feel right.'  Next thing I see is that I am in a dark room. It wasn't round, it wasn't square; it was just very, very warm, very beautiful, and very, very black.

  Experience Description 4844:  					</p>  					

I had been transported from my hometown to a big city hospital, as I was having a massive heart attack, when I got there. I was taken into a room with many doctors. I had been lying there on a stretcher when I looked up and said okay something is happening here - I don't feel so good.  

The next thing I know, I was in this dark room, no else was in there with me.  I felt a peacefulness and calmness that I had never encountered or experienced in my life. Once I was brought back out of this dark room, I knew that I had been somewhere where I had never been before, and know that I should never be scared in my life again to cross over. This room was black, didn't have corners, and I didn't see anyone or anything in the room. I remembered it was such a beautiful, warm room.  

  					Once I woke up, I was disappointed that I was no longer there.
