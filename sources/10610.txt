  		              		Experience Description   

    I was on a family vacation in San Diego when I was 11. We were using “boogie boards” to play around in the ocean. I went out on the beach by myself. This part is fuzzy, but I think a wave knocked me over and I was pinned under my board and I remember it feeling very heavy. I couldn’t move it and I felt panicked for a second. Then I felt peaceful. Everything was black and I got a sudden rush of all the memories in my life in a warm amber hue tone. Almost like I was watching it but not watching it - it just was in my mind but it was clear. I felt like going to sleep.   Somehow (I’m still not sure, or maybe just don’t remember due to the trauma) I was released from the board and started coughing up water immediately.
