The first was around the age of five. I can be no more precise than that. I had a ruptured appendix and was rushed to hospital. It was so long ago that I can only vaguely recall any details. I remember the room, the bed, the house. I also experienced double pneumonia in hospital. I do not recall being afraid, just puzzled about what was happening to me. I don't remember anyone ever talking to me about the experience at the time or ever after. It did leave me with an unusually large appendectomy scar, the size of which I have never noticed on anyone else.

A figure appeared to me, at the time I could only think of it as an angelic form of some kind. I can still picture the being. I do not recall our exchanging any words. I was presented a cup or chalice, which the angel/being held in one hand and a crown in the other, a small garland, which I imagined, was a crown. I understood I had a choice. I recall choosing the cup. This had no particular significance to me at the time. 

The NDE experience was at home before I was rushed to hospital. I remember nothing except awakening in bed in the hospital with people hovering over me.

Background Information:

Gender:	 Male

Date NDE Occurred:	  1936

  NDE Elements:

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Yes         A ruptured appendix.

Did you feel separated from your body?    No

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?       I don't recall.

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?       No

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?       Yes     An angelic type being.

Did you see an unearthly light?       Yes   Just the light that seemed to blow from the being I saw.

What emotions did you feel during the experience?       At peace.

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will   See main narrative.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       No       

     After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      No

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       Yes     I always recall being a very sensitive medium and often seemed to know intuitively what do to or what would be good for me, even though others thought I was a bit of a dreamer. I became a more reflective child and more religious.

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        The best part was recalling it later in my life and realizing what an extraordinary experience this was and that I had made a decision to continue life here on earth and to become a powerful contributor, which did eventually happen. The worst part was keeping it a secret, wondering if I was normal, and denying that I had any special gifts. I was afraid of being special.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    Only many years later. About 1970, when I was doing some therapy as part of my clinical training in psychology. I learned years later that I scared some of the participants in the courses I was taking. They were all professionals. I decided not to say any more about this particular childhood experience. I never shared it with my parents or brothers or any relatives.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       It now brings me much comfort and solace. I accept strong spiritual being-ness. I do not have a fear of death.  I remember having interesting thoughts while enjoying my solitude.  It is as if I was having a conversation with some being who always got my attention by beginning with phrases, 'My son, ...'
