hello everyone
there&#39;s dr. Steven Greer I&#39;m here with
dr. Russell Targ who is joining me for
this interesting evening discussion
about remote viewing and the science of
consciousness and I&#39;d like to thank dr.
tark for being here with us and a few
introductory things before we get into
the meat of this first of all thanks to
everyone who has helped us with this
project we are now number one worldwide
on iTunes and a lot of other platforms
for Close Encounters of the fifth kind
amongst all independent films including
ones with actors and big budgets we&#39;re
number four in the world which is very
rare so it&#39;s been a big adventure we&#39;re
now in the fourth week after the release
and we&#39;re still going strong due to you
guys so what I&#39;m hoping everyone will
continue to do is network this we have a
very limited you know sort of budget for
advertising and in fact none to speak of
and so the word getting out through all
of you as sort of our frontline people
ambassadors to the rest of the world
because we want to identify the one
percent of the public who can begin to
practice meditation and the path of the
seer and have this big transformational
effect within our civilization that can
happen with this one percent quantum
phase transition effect that we&#39;ve
spoken about and that we talked about in
the movie the other thing I&#39;d like to
thank everyone for people who have been
giving us feedback and fixes for the app
ce-5 contact app if you go to the iTunes
or a Google store and that is a number
two or three in educational apps in the
world right now and you guys have helped
make that possible it&#39;s the way that you
go from learning initially about this
subject and seeing the movie to being
able to really practice meditation
remote viewing and how to organize a
team where you go out under the stars
and
contact together and the third thing I
want to just sort of remind folks up we
have a crowdfunding site at ce-5 film
comm
of course we&#39;ve obviously finished the
funding and the film the funds were
trying to raise now is to get the
campaign stronger so that we can take
this information to more and more people
there are some significant costs
incurred for doing that and we want to
keep this going past May into June and
July in the summer and on and on
so those of you who can help us with
that you can make any kind of a
contribution and there are a lot of
great incentive gifts for that including
you know a download of the movie or the
download of the special features and
other books and meditation mp3 and an
other gift so if you go to CD 5 film con
you&#39;ll see all the incentive gifts for
folks who contribute and so those who
have I think we have almost 4,000 200 or
300 people who have contributed I want
to thank all of you guys we wouldn&#39;t be
here without that and if you have a
social media network either your own
site or get on other people&#39;s sites if
you can post our link and get the word
out and only about the crowdfunding page
but the the film you&#39;ll see we post a
new little clip every week one&#39;s coming
out tomorrow that focuses on the both
the app and and the movie and you can
share those links with all your social
media people so if the more you guys do
that the more we&#39;ll be able to get the
word out so that&#39;s just what I want to
say in an introductory way dr. Tarr I
want to thank you a little bit about why
don&#39;t you share folks a little bit about
your background as a physicist and and
how you got involved in remote viewing
in the science of consciousness
why was the laser physicist for about 50
years and did graduate work at Columbia
and then I was fortunate enough to be
invited to take part in the earliest
developments the laser the 1958 so I was
working on lasers before there were any
lasers and I did that for 15 years and
the end of my laser career I built a
giant thousand watt laser which no one
had ever seen before well I don&#39;t want
to talk like our president but it was
the largest laser that anyone had ever
seen and that was the time for me to
pursue what had been my passion all my
life I did magic of a teenager on the
stage pretending to look into the
distance and read people&#39;s minds and
then one of the about 16 I entered
college and realized that people really
did parapsychology for living and in
addition to fake magic as I was doing
there were people who were studying
looking into the distance looking into
the future and I sort of gave up my
stage career and eventually had the idea
I&#39;d like to start a program so 15 years
after Laser stuff I then started a
program at Stanford Research Institute
with my colleague Harold Puthoff was
also a laser guy right - laser guys
convinced the CIA and NASA to give us
money to start a program investigating
psychic abilities and that started in
1972 so since 72 my career has been how
do you sit with person a person and help
put them in touch with their own psychic
abilities because we were supported by
the CIA and the army and right up to the
Secretary of Defense right I&#39;m gonna sit
with me and say well we&#39;re supporting
your program I want to see something
psychic Iridessa RI who&#39;s a who&#39;s gonna
do the remote viewing and I said well
you are sir because if I if I brought in
Ingo Swann or Pat price and he described
where your major was hiding you think
it&#39;s a trick but if I sat here and
showed you how to do it and you had the
experience of describing what it looked
like where your major was and we would
take you you would Nick go back to
Washington with your own experience
correct and I had four and that was my
job my job was in the dark for 20 years
and show people how to get in touch with
their psychic abilities right and I like
that analogy because that&#39;s a lot of
what I tell people were doing with Close
Encounters or the fifth kind instead of
everyone being dependent on me doing
that with them
I&#39;d prefer people to learn what the
nature of the conscious mind is and what
no nonlocality in consciousness really
implies and begin to practice it and
have those experiences themselves
because it&#39;s a universal faculty let&#39;s
call it&#39;s a universal ability of all
sentient conscious intelligent beings to
be able to calm the mind to Center and
to sense or see or Intuit
something at a distance and in this case
because we&#39;re dealing with very advanced
civilizations that are also conscious
and sentient to communicate with them so
that&#39;s a big part of my whole emphasis
is trying to like you did for the
gentleman from the military teach them
to do it and then they realize it&#39;s
legitimate because they have their own
experiences so that&#39;s a really I didn&#39;t
know that part of how all that started
but that&#39;s exactly I think the correct
approach rather than it being all dag
didactic so in the beginning in 1972 I
was a parapsychologist psychic
researcher working for the CIA and
during the Cold War we had to find
missing hostages downed airplanes all
sorts of things the film that I made
that you&#39;ve seen third eye spies open
with a recitation by Jimmy Carter about
how we found a downed Russian airplane
in Africa
and nobody could find it because it was
under the canopy so even though we had
wonderful satellite photography they
couldn&#39;t find it but a lady psychic in
California was able to mark up a map put
down the coordinates the CIA launched a
helicopter in desire and where they
landed the helicopter natives were
dragging the fragments of the airplane
out of the river right in front of where
the CIA landed their helicopter right so
that was a that and we did that for two
decades right but I&#39;m no longer doing
psychic research I&#39;m back to being a
psychic entertainer and when I my gig
now is I will tell people about psychic
abilities and show them our slides from
what I did and then I will end up saying
and let me show you how we did that
right now so now I&#39;m back on the stage
doing magic if real magic real magic
yeah because I often scare my producer
by saying and let me tell you if there&#39;s
anybody in this big audience doesn&#39;t
have a psychic experience or see
something psychic we&#39;ll give you all
your money back oh my god are you sure
you want to do that and in two decades
they&#39;ve never had to give anybody their
money back
because what I&#39;m asking them to do
apparently is a natural ability and I
can give you the magic words I just tell
people I have an interesting object
hidden away in the box on the stage and
all I want you to do is tell me about
the surprising images that show up a
year awareness right now don&#39;t guess
what it is guessing of the worst thing
in the world correct memory and
imagination are a kind of psychic noise
and I am showing you my lesson for today
is to show you how to separate the
psychic image from the mental noise and
we know how to do that and we have
amazing results of tell me about what
you do for wimpy
with with people to do that to get that
kind of clarity and I just have to get
them to suspend their disbelief give up
trying to guess right they worked at
what I&#39;ve learned the thing that&#39;s been
known for 2,000 years
this is Padma sin Baba was over my
shoulder here I&#39;m on the left side
wearing a scarf he wrote a book called
self liberation through seeing with
naked awareness and he wrote that 1200
years ago right he said if you&#39;re
looking for self-liberation moving into
timeless awareness which is who you are
then you have to give up your desire to
name things and grasp things and that
was his language in the 800s so 1200
years ago he already knew that you could
quiet your mind move your awareness into
distance space time you just have to
give up naming things and that&#39;s what
I&#39;m still doing on the stage of that as
an opportunity to give people the
experience and and then they can do that
and it&#39;s just it&#39;s snow you don&#39;t have
to pay me thousands of dollars for a
week-long workshop just sit down and
tell me what experiencing and that&#39;s all
there is to it and I did that with
generals and army officers and famous
scientists right and turned out to be
not so hard so so how do you what do you
tell them about making that distinction
because a lot of people when they do
this they they&#39;ll say well I don&#39;t know
if that&#39;s my imagination or I&#39;m guessing
or if it&#39;s something I&#39;m actually
legitimately sensing well I think a
pretty pretty demanding situation that
I&#39;m sitting there across the table okay
so here&#39;s your here&#39;s your paper here&#39;s
a pen
Joe has been taken away somewhere and I
have no idea where it could be the
interesting place make a little sketch
of the surprising image it shows up
right because well I don&#39;t see anything
I say well that&#39;s all right just draw
the surprising thing that shows up and I
once had a famous physicist Yukina run
off with a Israeli physicist you&#39;ll
probably get a Nobel Prize pretty soon
and he was brought in as a kind of
oversight person because everyone trusts
it but s RI and how my colleague and
runoffs friend went to hide somewhere
well I don&#39;t know anything I don&#39;t I
don&#39;t know about you Russell when I
close my eyes as dark and I said well
they&#39;re they&#39;re coming they&#39;re getting
ready to come back now I not know I know
you don&#39;t see anything but for the
experiment just make up something
pretend you see something like and I
didn&#39;t say the word was like
free-associate I just a pretend you see
something we have to get something on
the paper and so it&#39;s a really a demand
situation right and I&#39;m the boss so I
say draw some damn thing get it on the
paper so he said well I see some kind of
ducks my fault my mother used to have a
duck farm in Israel I said that&#39;s great
draw me a duck then he did that and
he&#39;ll came back with a rose partner and
they had gone to a duck pond five miles
away by the airport in Palo Alto right
and and and that&#39;s how I made my living
for 20 years at SR I does I have I got
very proficient at doing that particular
magic trick and we had very great
success my last group at SR I were six
army officers from Fort Meade
intelligence officers and my job was to
show her National Security Agency
National Security Agency and I had
issued teach those six guys how to do
remote viewing and then they went back
to Fort Meade in created an army psychic
core and that ran for a decade and the
famous most prodigious viewer of that
group was Joe mcmoneagle
who was a Warrant Officer chief warrant
officer and he was as competent as
great psychic Police Commissioner Pat
price or Ingo Swann who invented sight
who invented remote viewing in the
modern era in goes Ingo saved us from
guessing cards and doing things that
don&#39;t really work
Ingo said I can focus my attention
anywhere on the planet or off so I&#39;m not
going to do card guessing but you&#39;re
asking me to do with a trivialization of
my ability right I&#39;m gonna do right no I
he he said well why don&#39;t you just go
hide someplace in the san francisco bay
area and i&#39;ll tell you what it looks
like so we had a artist draw sixty does
collect 60 locations and put them in a
file
secure file that we didn&#39;t have a safe
that we didn&#39;t have a key to so each day
he&#39;ll would go to the safe use a random
number generator to get an envelope and
then go to that location and whoever was
the viewer for that day would sit with
me and i would say well how and your
major of going to hide someplace tell me
what you see and they did excellently so
I had six army officers who are
statistically significant at odds of one
in a million right your control people
they had never done it before right and
these were not people who had done a lot
of meditation practice and things of
this sort
absolutely not these are these are
intelligence officers from fort meade
right and what we&#39;re asking - to do is
something that had been understood for
two millennia since the beginning of
buddhism our our five hundred years
after the beginning of Buddhism at the
time of Christ and many people in
between have written about it the person
that I find most interesting to talk
about here is LUN Champa wrote a book
called the
basic space of phenomena and the reason
I have that book is it sounds like a
physics book it doesn&#39;t sound like
metaphysics and long champa was a 12th
century remote-viewing meditation genius
there was no the earlier people like
Padma Sam bhava who brought buddhism to
tibet was really a hindu so if you read
his writings they&#39;re full of multi-armed
deities doing various manifestations
they&#39;re not there no no 8-iron people in
launched Appa Don Champa is telling you
the basic space of phenomena how your
true nature is timeless awareness
well you if you think that who you are
is what you see in the mirror in the
morning you&#39;re in for a lot of suffering
and I think most people can experience
that right as who you are is as timeless
awareness so you can quiet your mind in
any meditation time or writing on the
streetcar or doing whatever you&#39;re doing
you can quiet your mind and move into
the spacious realms which is where
you&#39;re to work often takes you and a
person can become very skillful at
moving into the the starry night and the
spacious realm are Carl Jung wrote about
that in his famous dreams memories and
reflections and what he&#39;s described as
really an out-of-body experience where
he moved into the out and of the
universe and could see stars and could
even look back and see the earth and he
wrote that Oh in the 1930s in Italy an
early out-of-body off the planet remote
viewing and he didn&#39;t call it remote
viewing of course he has called it
spacious awareness and what what we find
is that this timeless awareness is
independent of distance and independent
of time correct well the interesting
thing that I can tell you now is
that in a decade of collecting data with
army officers and famous psychics doing
hundreds of trials what we know for a
fact is that it&#39;s no harder to describe
something in China or in Soviet Siberia
than it is to describe something across
the street so physically but cold as a
non-local ability in that is absolutely
no degradation and accuracy or
reliability describing a weapon shop in
Russia or a atomic bomb test in the
future in China and that&#39;s what we&#39;re
doing for the CIA they would come and
say what&#39;s how what&#39;s going on at these
coordinates or what will happen at these
coordinates three days from now that&#39;s
how we supported ourselves and they
every year they expected us to continue
to work with people I was not a viewer
exactly I was a facilitator that my job
was to I was an interviewer as I was
beat I as an interviewer I&#39;m between the
target and the viewer I&#39;m trying really
over to the target and you see the CIA
paid me to sit in the dark for a decade
so my spiritual development was really
paid for by the CIA a very usual
situation so I got very skillful and
helping people make this disjunction
between what they see in the mirror and
who they really are which is awareness
well and the end of what you said about
if you can see it whether it&#39;s across
the street or in China by extension you
can apply that although it was harder to
verify it until there&#39;s some
confirmation event that happens what&#39;s
happening at a star system in the
andromeda galaxy to an atom really
generally get feedback after our trial
right well it&#39;s it&#39;s and that&#39;s what&#39;s
very important I want to interject
when when we&#39;re training people to do
the cg5 initiative I always point out if
you want to do some training you need to
pick something that can be objectively
verified when you&#39;re working with your
team and have someone who&#39;s sort of the
facilitator and have someone and the
others that are have a target but there
it&#39;s controlled and so you can get an
answer because if you&#39;re always saying
well we&#39;re gonna Remote View something
that has no ability to objectively
verify the the person trying to develop
their skills doesn&#39;t get any feedback
that they can count on so that&#39;s why
it&#39;s very important that there be some
controls set up so that people can
practice their conscious abilities and
then have some verification of and
feedback so that they what I call to
develop the ring of truth in other words
where you as you practice this what I
have found since I was a teenager and
began to have these experiences was that
when you get something that&#39;s a I call
it a hit a walk on something that&#39;s
quite it has a certain feel to it that
resonates as opposed to a random
imagination or something from your
memory or guessing so you begin to get a
refinement of your own truth-o-meter
your truth meter as to is that correct
or not correct so that it can develop
into an iterative back-and-forth process
that becomes more and more honed and
accurate over time but that feedback is
not necessary see the people in the
laboratory with me would always get
feedback because I want them to learn
what it feels like but when they moved
off to Fort Meade and we&#39;re looking for
the downed airplane or the Russian
trawler or the contraband drugs or
whatever they were doing they frequently
were not given feedback because they
were not cleared for what the graph to
describe that as if somebody was
kidnapped general Dozier was kidnapped
in Italy and Joe mcmoneagle described
where he was and Joe didn&#39;t get feedback
for years because he was not cleared to
get feedback on that nut didn&#39;t matter
at all
yeah everyone can do it that way but if
you&#39;re getting feedback then that&#39;s what
how you begin to increase your own the
trust in yourself
those are you here you can&#39;t learn
anything without feedback right and so
that&#39;s where I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s
dependent but when you&#39;re a student
wanting to develop this ability it&#39;s
very important to set up situations
where you do get feedback and really
yeah feedback is essential for learning
yes the other the most interesting thing
that I can tell you in this little
get-together is that looking into the
future is just as easy as describing
something in the present for right when
when launch opera was talking about
timeless awareness as your nature he
wasn&#39;t making a metaphor he wanted you
to know in fact he said specifically in
the book the book that I showed that as
you&#39;re able to move into timeless
awareness which is where he resides
there is no cause and effect for your
consciousness and I was shocked to find
that somebody in the 12th century was
talking about free of cause and effect
that seemed like a very contemporary
19th century idea and he said no there&#39;s
no cause of affect because your
consciousness is outside of time wait
that&#39;s a very very advanced view pre
relativistic view and the idea is I used
I run throughout a book called limitless
mind and what I had in mind is that a
person could quiet their mind and
describe anything on the planet and then
toward the end of our time with Ingo
Swann we also had a contract to build a
new research with the ESP teaching
machine which is now available at no
charge from the iTunes Store this called
ESP trainer so I&#39;m fishing in my pocket
for this application that started our
program the program started it just put
into your search on the store ESP
trainer that&#39;s right so this is the
gadget I had okay there&#39;s a four choice
trainer and I had that with me at a
conference where I met Werner von Braun
and von Braun did extremely well with
this four choice ESP trainer you could
even hear beep in the background and he
then took me to Jim Fletcher the
administrator of NASA Ron Brown said
Targa&#39;s built some lasers for us so I
know that he knows something and this
ESP teaching machine seems to work I&#39;m
getting very good scores why don&#39;t you
give him some money so that was the
first money we got on our program
because of so our first money came
because von Braun had a psychic
grandmother and scored well with my ESP
teaching machine very good was that in
the early 70s or mid-70s 1972 Conference
on speculative technology as another
long story which I won&#39;t tell you a
whole chain of coincidences led me this
conference where I met Ron Brown and
that was beginning there was the first
money we ever got for the program and it
was just a a chain of amazing unlikely
thing as one right after another that I
had nothing to do with there were just
things that occurred in places where I
was invited to walk into and at the end
of that walk were the part of the golden
pot at the end of the rainbow and they
and then we started our program that
there was no it no further fuss we I met
Ron Brown he scored well on my ESP game
I was introduced to Jim Fletcher he gave
us money and I can then go an SSRI and
say we&#39;ve got some dough let&#39;s start a
program great that&#39;s a very interesting
genesis of that and what one of the
things that i like about your approach
is that it demystifies and I was trying
to tell is that your mind is not limited
in the oh I know what I was trying to
tell you we then had our NASA contract
monitor in my office and he turned to
Ingo Swann and said we&#39;re about to
launch our pioneer spacecraft to Jupiter
can you tell us anything interesting
we&#39;ll find Jupiter and Ingo said well
give me a pad of paper and I&#39;ll draw
something and what he drew is Jupiter
with a ring around it he said you&#39;re
gonna find a ring of ice crystals around
Jupiter right and my friend George has
David said well you&#39;re thinking of
Saturn aren&#39;t you Ingo and INGOs took a
puff of his cigar and didn&#39;t blow smoke
in the guy his face but that was the
feeling he I said well I&#39;ve been looking
at the solar system my entire life
believe me that I know the difference
between Saturn and Jupiter you&#39;re gonna
see a ring around Jupiter that no one
has ever seen before
right and eight months later they sent
us pictures of the ring of crystals
around Jupiter and that&#39;s five hundred
million miles away so what wasn&#39;t the
point I&#39;m making about the ce-5 contact
app what we&#39;re doing is telling people
to calm the mind begin to practice a
remote viewing approach that&#39;s the
modern I call a pop-culture term but in
reality it&#39;s it&#39;s a very ancient ability
of the way of the seer that every human
who is conscious can become aware of the
conscious mind in its limitless aspect
and you can not only remove you
something on under a controlled
situation with your team and practice or
even with these technologies we have now
but you can also do it when you&#39;re in a
real sitting under the under the sky
with a group of people and remote-view
what&#39;s out in space but the part of this
that&#39;s very interesting and this is
where this term
ws FM comes from its a term used as the
CIA for a weird science and freakin
magic and my uncle&#39;s company which with
Northrop Grumman they just caught it pfm
pure [ __ ] magic excuse my language
but that&#39;s what it was called and it&#39;s
it is a whole range of Sciences and
technologies that go from consciousness
sciences to science of consciousness all
the way into a very high voltage
electromagnetic systems and at one of
the more interesting applications of
that which I wrote about in 1991 I
believe is is something called
technology assisted consciousness and
also consciousness assisted technologies
and that civilizations that are
interstellar or also perforce must be
transdimensional because they have they
cannot be locked into 3d speed of light
systems but as you evolve into that kind
of civilization you have things that are
at a let&#39;s say orders of magnitude
beyond what Elon Musk is trying to
develop with his neural link project
where you&#39;d be able to think to your
computer and have it do things
accurately that these civilizations that
are that advanced that are behind of
these UFOs those systems are very
advanced technologies that interface
with consciousness in two directions
they&#39;re interfacing that where the
person can have a technology that
assists in the process of what they&#39;re
wanting to intend to do or see with
consciousness and thought but the
reverse happens as well where they can
interact with the technology and augment
the functionality of a technological
device with their mind and consciousness
so there&#39;s this interplay that we&#39;re
beginning to have people experiment with
in various ways like dr. John at
Princeton and elsewhere but on a level
where you&#39;re talking thousands and
perhaps millions of years more to
than the technologies that are at least
in an Declassified way extant on earth
today one of the interesting I don&#39;t
know I want to ask you this did you ever
in 1956 there was a man I got to know
he&#39;s quite elderly when I met him in the
90s who had developed a technology it
was sort of a headset that would
facilitate the augment this innate
ability for the mind to sense and
receive or transmit information very
accurately through nonlocality
and unfortunately there was a very
advanced unacknowledged special access
project that sort of bought that out and
took it into the agency the CIA but I
got to know this man quite well he was a
electronics genius and he had developed
a number of these sort of approaches
back in the late 50s to 60s did you ever
come across that in your garage had made
something like that as a hearing aid
mm-hmm and he was interested he was he
sounded like your guy but I gather he&#39;s
not I&#39;m a hearing aid where you put
earphones on and it puts put signals
right into the eighth nerve so even
though your whole mechanical hearing
apparatus wasn&#39;t working you could uh
you could hear things anyway and this
was though the kind of hearing aid
Puharich was very interested in psychic
things magic mushrooms and he was the
irregular was a protege of jabrai
Newhart&#39;s for a long long time now one
of the I believe in those timeless
awareness that you were talking about is
a multi-dimensional aspect of our
consciousness where we live in a complex
space-time we&#39;re familiar with the four
dimensions that Einstein talks about and
Minkowski before Einstein was aware of
the
each of those dimensions could have a
real part in a imaginary part and my
partner Elizabeth rauscher was the
theoretical physicist helped create a
way to make use of this eight
dimensional space-time we&#39;re not adding
any new dimensions we&#39;re not saying ESP
is very tricky let&#39;s add another
dimension we&#39;re saying the space-time we
live in it has a familiar four
dimensions and you notice that each of
those is complex of the real and
imaginary part and in the complex
space-time let&#39;s just call them so it
doesn&#39;t sound magical Menken minkowski&#39;s
complex space-time there will always be
a path of zero distance connecting any
two points in the space-time and that
follows from the data we have with
psychic research that it&#39;s just as easy
to describe any point in space-time it
requires no time and the distance
doesn&#39;t matter
so I&#39;ve most of my life I&#39;ve been
comfortable talking about limitless mind
and as I become increasingly comfortable
with the idea of non non duality where
we are neither finite and nor infinite
early Buddhists would say you&#39;re neither
you&#39;re neither finite and they&#39;re not
finite neither gets nor that yes ma&#39;am
Nagarjuna would say that so all these
people at the time of Christ suddenly
become very intelligent as we finally
catch up with them
but the idea you might consider whether
you can be comfortable saying yes of
course our consciousness is infinite
there&#39;s no limit at all to what we can
see out into the universe and the our
data supports that for example somebody
would say well how can you say something
was outrageous as psychic ability is
infinite and I would say that I&#39;ve done
hundreds of experiments and Bob John at
Princeton has done thousands of
experiments
there are a hundred other researchers
who are doing remote viewing and there
is not one drop of evidence to even
suggest that the accuracy and
reliability falls off with distance on
the planet or off the planet for it ingo
was able to instantaneously say oh
you&#39;re interested in Jupiter let me tell
you about the ice crystals so he could
fling of the tension five hundred
million miles away instantaneously did
not take him any time and his drawing I
wrote a book not too long ago called the
reality of ESP and I have a picture that
Ingo drew of the planet with the ice
crystals together with nasa&#39;s photograph
of the ice crystals and it looks like
Ingo is right there drawing what the guy
asked him to draw and nobody on the
planet knew about it right I think that
our consciousness is infinite there
there&#39;s no left-right pain that it&#39;s
limitless implies that there is some
kind of limit and you can pass that and
I think that it&#39;s more than that I think
that we have to be courageous and say
that consciousness is infinite
there is no there&#39;s no known limitation
to our consciousness yes and at that
level of reality it means that every
point in space and time is connected to
every other point in space and time by
virtue of the nature of this a non-local
infinite aspect of consciousness and
this is why people can they can you can
Remote View something in the here and
now or you can sense something from
10,000 years ago that later gets
discovered and verify or something into
the future and and and in terms of space
or time there isn&#39;t a boundary the but
the boundary mainly is in what yoga non
used to call the lack of spiritual
adventuresome Ness amongst people who
sort of keep themselves in a
a box and they clip their own wings and
one of the things I think we all have to
at some point come around to
understanding is that whatever cage we
put ourselves in we have to we have to
use the key to open that cage up and out
of that cage those you can bring that
we&#39;ve been talking about remote viewing
as though it&#39;s just some sensing with
your eyes but you can bring your
sensitivity or your emotionality even
your sexuality with you on an adventure
like this you can move and have you have
you had personal experiences with UFOs
or with aliens that you could tell us
about well yes force yeah I mean it&#39;s
anything you&#39;d like to tell us about
mm-hmm well I think probably the thing
that started what my path on this were
the Close Encounters of the fifth kind
started was I had a near-death
experience when I was 17 and after that
near-death experiment experiment and
it&#39;s infinite aspect but I was raised a
very devout atheist so we didn&#39;t believe
in anything and I didn&#39;t have any
religious or indoctrination from any
tradition so I had always loved space
and the stars in nature so when I had my
near-death experience I found myself out
in space and I had this oneness
experience it reminds me a lot of when I
you know I shared this experience with
astronaut Edgar Mitchell and the sort of
kind of a similar to what he had when he
was out in space and looked back to the
earth but it was his really deep
experience later I realized that it was
an experience of cosmic consciousness
and what I later learned would be called
unity consciousness in that state of
course eventually I did a whole series
of things happened during that
experience and
about a maybe two months later on my
18th birthday this coincidental
I learned a type of meditation mantra
meditation that enabled me to sort of
calm my mind and get centered and it was
just a meditation technique I wasn&#39;t
trying to Remote View I wasn&#39;t trying to
do anything but I went off to college
and I went up in to the mountains of
North Carolina I selected where I wanted
to go to college I could care less about
academics at that point I was interested
in being in the beauty of nature so I&#39;d
go up to this 5,000 foot mountain and
meditate and I would go one evening in
the October of 73 in the middle of the
Yom Kippur War I&#39;m up there meditating
and just before I go to sit down to
meditate before sunset there is a
seamless materialized fully materialized
disc that appeared light like the one
that&#39;s in the movie that&#39;s the Vancouver
Island Discs by the mountain mountain
and it&#39;s like when I had seen when I was
about 8 or 9 in Charlotte North Carolina
as a little kid a whole bunch of the
kids in the neighborhood my twin sister
who still remembers this saw it but I
thought well they&#39;re back I didn&#39;t have
any other thought about it and it kind
of vanished
so I sat and meditated I went into this
deep meditation where I gained the state
of the same level of consciousness of
that unity consciousness I had during my
near-death experience which had happened
six months earlier and I was very deep
in meditation for it had to be for more
than an hour cause when I finished the
meditation the whole it was very dark
and above me was the Milky Way galaxy
and I was in this mite there wasn&#39;t any
boundary between myself and this state
of unbounded infinite consciousness as
an experience even though I was awake
and walking around and so I got up and a
beautiful thought came into my mind
behold what a beautiful universe God has
made
even though I didn&#39;t have a particularly
religious orientation and with that I
went into that state as if I was out in
space but all in my body all at the same
time and I realized there was a glow
over the crest of the mountain and there
was an object and I wasn&#39;t sure what it
was and then there was this creature
that I thought was a deer up on its hind
legs because I didn&#39;t know anything
about ETS or any of this and he this
creature I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s male or
female it had beautiful almost like deer
like eyes and can touch me on my right
shoulder and I was wearing a ski jacket
as an October up at over 5,000 feet and
as soon as I was touched all that hair
still on my I had this electromagnetic
discharge and I looked down I could
literally see my my ski jacket indent
and could feel to this day I can feel
that boom and with that I seemingly
dematerialized had this experience with
these ETS on this craft it lasted
probably about three hours I&#39;m
guesstimating it didn&#39;t seem like three
hours and what we were really doing was
sitting in meditation together and
that&#39;s when we sort of co-created these
the Close Encounters of the fifth kind
protocol techniques and the
communication system so they&#39;re a
jeopardy when you were on the spacecraft
I&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t feel any jeopardy
or fear when you were on this way not at
all none zero it was beautiful now what
was strange is that when I reappeared
back on that mountaintop so it sort of
is a big at the top it&#39;s like a long
Ridge and there was a fire tower at the
top of it and that&#39;s where I had sat the
meditates it was at the pinnacle and
when I came back I was about a quarter
of a mile back down the gravel road that
leads up to the fire tower and I had the
strangest electromagnetic field around
me where I was able to I wasn&#39;t
exactly levitating but I was able to go
like from here to them maybe 15 20 feet
with one sort of like I was just sort of
leap a little go food boom boom and I
did that all the way back down this
mountain in the dark was very dark I was
mostly just sensing my way down and when
I got down to the town of Boone North
Carolina I thought we had had a nuclear
war because the town was deserted no one
was out I thought it should have been
maybe nine o&#39;clock and it turned out it
was after midnight and back then you got
you know they had you know men&#39;s and
women&#39;s dorms which you had a curfew you
had to be in there at a certain time and
they locked it so I the wake up the
Resident Assistant and the dorm to get
me in and I realized I had you know had
these three hours where I was in this
timeless state but there was also a
transdimensional physical effect that
happened not the whole way down the
mountain but where I had a sort of
electromagnet of gravity field around me
so I had this sort of quasi levitation
experience as I&#39;m going down back down
to town so what I started doing is a
bizarre says sounds I&#39;m this 18-year old
guy and so every night before I would go
to bed I would lay down I would do my
meditation and then I would go into that
state of consciousness and remote view
where these et crap might be and I would
then invite them to come again and every
single night I did that the Forest
Service up in this area of North
Carolina mountains were reporting UFOs
here and there and what have you the
reason I stopped doing it it kind of
freaked me out one night I did this with
real specificity and showing what I
looked like and I think just as a way of
saying yo we get it you don&#39;t have to
belabor the point here the ETS basically
said we can understand this there was a
boy driving on a road between Boone and
Morganton that had a craft that appeared
beside his car and it stopped the engine
and and he had this experience and when
they showed this guy who was in the
newspaper he looked like he could have
been my twin brother so it was a very
strange thing and I said you know maybe
I shouldn&#39;t be fooling around with this
and I saw I have some genuinely
meaningful purpose so I I didn&#39;t do it
again for about two years and renew
there a good indoctrination the way it
was it was it was a tutorial
you know I&#39;m 18 years old I didn&#39;t
understand anything about the science of
consciousness really I&#39;ve learned a
meditation technique and I was not
raised steeped in sort of mysticism and
ESP and I mean my family if it didn&#39;t
fit into a test tube it didn&#39;t exist in
the discussion so we were very linear
material reductionist thinking so this
was this was quite an eye-opener for me
as a young boy or young man yeah those
are very interesting thank you for
sharing that Half Price was the most
psychic person we ever worked with
through some psychic Police Commissioner
who could essentially describe anything
you wanted to know instantaneously and
he was very interested in UFOs and one
day he laid out a big atlas for us that
he drew with UFO bases is one at Mount
Hayes in Alaska another one in South
America someplace no they were near an
army base in Australia and another one
of the Pyrenees and I understand pop
Mount Hayes still of the site where
people see UFOs and the CIA was very
interested in the one he had in
Australia because he said that&#39;s
something that they have their eyes on
and this was part of our lunchtime
conversation a placement area very
interested in UFOs right and he said ask
me have you ever visited one and of
course nothing could have been further
from my life my thoughts but I was
pretty experienced of the remote
viewer at that time right so I went home
in the evening and as I was doing a sort
of bedtime meditation which is sort of
like an out-of-body experience
the remote viewing you can go very
briefly and remote viewing you can go to
a distant place open the door turn on
the lights go inside go down the stairs
you have quite mobility at the target we
would say right so in this case I
thought I would just move out into space
as I had already read that Carl Jung had
done I had the idea that I could move
from my bed out into space and I did
that and I was looking for a UFO right
this would be 1973 and I went out into
space which was increasingly black and I
found came upon something which was
truly enormous as we see pictures of
UFOs and they looked like
automobile-sized the thing that I came
upon was like destroyer size or
battleships a huge expanse of curvy
material right and I just drifted inside
to those very familiar with with how
that would be then well I wasn&#39;t fearful
I&#39;m I was quite accustomed working with
my psychic pal hella Hamid we would
often she would go someplace and to say
it&#39;s dark and I turn on the lights for
her so I was quite accustomed to
visiting distant places where I have
mobility and I went into this place and
I came upon a whole row of things that
look like beds and there were some kind
of creature bodies under hair dryers so
they&#39;re like 1215 bodies in a row all
under hair dryers and I walked to the
end of that and I then heard some noise
occurring and that frightened me I&#39;d
obviously had no idea
what was going on nobody invited me in
and I&#39;m kind of grinding sound that&#39;s a
good time to get out of here I had that
experience hello and I were once in
Brezhnev&#39;s office in the Kremlin
psychically and we then went down into a
computer bay and I just became fearful
it&#39;s the idea that I had a lot of
clearances but I didn&#39;t have clearance
to be and they computer bay in the
Kremlin I just had a special paranoia
let&#39;s get the hell out of here and that
was my feeling here and right old path
price about that experience you say
you&#39;re lucky you got out of there before
they grab your consciousness and they
just find you dead in your bed at home
you ain&#39;t to leave Hey because
impression it&#39;s all yeah the Soviet
Union yeah that&#39;s where you gotta if
you&#39;re gonna be a traveling psychic you
got to know it&#39;s like you gotta know
when to hold them and when to fold them
well luckily the interstellar
civilizations don&#39;t have that they&#39;ve
evolved past the point where that would
be an issue however I have there&#39;s an
interesting distinction here and that is
an out-of-body experience
versus being centered and deeper or more
quiet aspects of consciousness where
you&#39;re actually still very much your
your let&#39;s call it your so-called astral
body or your body of light that people
talk about traveling with and your
physical body are still all together but
the consciousness is sort of the field
consciousness that you&#39;re connected and
identifying to Go&#39;s is at that distant
place even though there&#39;s not a
separation of the physical and so called
a theory or astral body and we&#39;re in an
out-of-body experience you generally
have feelings associated with what&#39;s
going on in that location yeah it&#39;s more
technical more like actually being there
and you communicate with with somebody
at the distant place they are they&#39;re
aware that you&#39;re your present yes
well the
depends on their conscious evolution
they may be aware of you even without
your so-called astral or body of light
out-of-body experience and I like
telling the story you know my wife and I
were doing a we have four daughters and
four anniversary one year we got a nanny
for a few days and we went down to Costa
Rica and we were it was beautiful
setting on the Pacific coast and and we
were staying at this little modest motel
along the ocean and I loved the ocean
and I loved that kind of aquamarine
water and green and it just so that
night I went to sleep and I was doing a
meditation and I went into sleep time
and I wanted to go travel over the water
so I left my body but my wife had
awakened just at the instant and she
said what it looked like was and she was
sort of very still half asleep so if she
was sort of had more relaxed I guess her
intellect and filters were down a little
so she looked and she saw this sort of
silver gray thing but it was looked like
my shape that sat up and left my body
and threw up flew out the window well
she saw that at the same instant I was
flying out over the water and and I was
seeing everything even though it was
pitch dark as if it was with the most
perfect celestial crystal-clear light
now she was back in the bed thinking I
had died she thought I was dead because
she saw my spirit leave so she was
thinking oh my god I&#39;m stuck here in
Costa Rica I have four children at home
and my husband has just died and she was
really worried and of course after I had
done my little adventure I come back she
should by then she&#39;s awake enough she
doesn&#39;t see me reenter my body but I as
I&#39;m laying there I feel that I&#39;m being
watched and I realized mmm
emily is awake and looking at man I look
over and she says you&#39;re back
I said back I haven&#39;t gone anywhere she
says oh yes you did
and she describes what she saw and the
nth time interval and everything was
exactly while I was out on my little
journey flying around exploring the
Costa Rican coast the Pacific coast and
that is when I realized that if someone
is in a relaxed enough state of mind
even their physical eyes can pick up
this sort of subtle presence and energy
so it says if you are going to journey
with you journey outside of your body
but with your consciousness it&#39;s good to
be vigilant yes right so anyway so that
I think that&#39;s a really important part
of this is the you and I spoke about
this before the the amazing abilities
that Pete and experiences people can
have about remote places or the future
in a lucid dream where there you know
there are sleeves they&#39;re not having
necessarily an out-of-body experience
but they&#39;re asleep and they into it or
see something from the future whether
it&#39;s the next day or a month or two away
and and I think I mentioned to you that
I met my wife that way I was in Haifa
Israel and I had these five dreams in a
row night after night where I in the
dream that was very 3d very full-color
there was a very enlightened man who who
would come to me and introduced me to
this woman and said this is who you
should marry and gave me all kinds of
information she&#39;s gonna be older than
you she&#39;s gonna come from far away and
then leave but it will work out and
don&#39;t worry and all this it was very
detailed and so I told I was with a
friend and I said you know I need to see
who this person is now I&#39;m 22 I have no
interest in being married at that point
but sure enough I guess maybe a couple
months later she comes to Israel she was
in the Peace Corps she comes to Israel
for a conference and we&#39;re up in these
gardens up on top of Mount Carmel and I
see her walk through the gate I turned
to my friend said that&#39;s her but what
are you gonna do you&#39;re gonna go up to a
complete stranger like a madman and say
hey I saw you in this dream but so I
just say anything I say anything
there was a beastly sort of luck I never
heard that before yeah
and so I just said well I&#39;m not going to
do or say anything except you know we
talked and maybe we talked for about an
hour and we immediately had this sort of
sense that we&#39;d always known each other
and but then I said that&#39;s it it&#39;s all
she had was my first name and I did a
little prayer and I said okay if the if
the Great Spirit wants me to marry this
person she&#39;s gonna have to reach out to
me and somehow find me but I&#39;m never
going to reach out to her and she but
she was on her way when she left Israel
she met her mom and in London just for a
little trip and she felt so compelled
all he knew about me was my name was
Steve and I was from North Carolina so
she wrote to where I was working and
said and just addressed it to the that
address Steve from North Carolina and
the letter got to me and after that we
sort of car responded back then there
was no internet in 90 this is 1978 and
after a few back-and-forth I told her
this story I&#39;m now sharing with you guys
and she just felt yes that&#39;s right so we
literally said okay let&#39;s have a
courtship so we went to Alaska for 10
days had an old-fashioned courtship and
got married and that was 41 years ago no
answer so that&#39;s you know I tell people
that these abilities that come that you
develop they have all kinds of
applications for your personal wide
professional life and that we should we
need to kind of demystify it and
people know that this capability to be
awake in the state of consciousness that
it is infinite and not contain space and
time box is extremely useful and
practical and although I wouldn&#39;t admit
it when I was a practicing ER doctor
resulted in me having the knowledge of
things not yet seen that saved a number
of lives
that&#39;s very wonderful story I&#39;d like to
put the cap on my story what I talked
about going to brain of his office with
hella I was describing that as oh yes by
the way four people don&#39;t remember
Brezhnev was the head of year of the
Soviet Union yeah two years later I had
left s RI and I was lecturing I was like
guest of the Soviet Academy of Sciences
in mosque in the Kremlin and they says
very interesting story I guess if that&#39;s
true we can&#39;t hide anything anymore and
everybody was very excited about that in
the Kremlin he says there anything you&#39;d
like to see as long as you&#39;re here
oh yes I&#39;d like to see Brezhnev&#39;s office
I don&#39;t have to see Brezhnev I just like
to see where he sits and hellas
description of regime&#39;s office exactly
correspondent to what she drew and what
I saw so I had a chance to get feedback
of a large desk on the right and windows
on the left we didn&#39;t I did not ask to
go behind the desk and see the computer
room but her description as an
out-of-body experience and I had to open
the door for her and turn on the lights
so our little Fantasyland trip @sr I was
exactly what I got to experience 6,000
miles later and two years in the future
so this is a case where I had this
Autobody experience with hella and I got
perfect feedback for so it was not a it
gives some reality to these things that
we see exactly it gives you a validation
if you know I shared the story before I
maybe in one of the books I&#39;ve written
about this person who came into the
emergency department who had been to I
haven&#39;t shared this one but she had been
to many many specialist cuz she was
having very strange visual problems and
she&#39;d been to neurologists
ophthalmologist she finally came in to
the ER not in an emergency but just
distress that nobody would take her
seriously and I was examining her and
she didn&#39;t have any objective you know
findings neurologically or ophthalmology
but I sensed I could see that she had a
brain tumor in a specific area of the
brain and there&#39;s and so I got a cat
scan which today I probably would be
punished forgetting because there
weren&#39;t objective findings to warrant
the expense but in those days and maybe
still in the emergency setting you can
just order it and there&#39;s no review you
you just order it you get it it&#39;s done
it&#39;s not like going through a bunch of
fascists at the health insurance company
or Medicare so we got this back and it
turned out she had this tumor that
everyone had not thought possible that
was exactly in the area of the brain
centrally not in the optic nerve or the
eye where it wasn&#39;t engine and growing
into areas given her all manner of
visual disturbances and triggering all
kinds of visual effects and you know
unfortunately it had continued to grow
of course she was referred to
neurosurgery and and what have you in
oncology but she lived but it was one of
those things where I tell people that
you can combine your your objective
senses your five
and your scientific knowledge and your
training and whatever your area is and
add to it this mental capability this
ability for the conscious mind to sense
and see and know things and they can
then work together and we live in a time
where everything has to be separated in
this reductionist words are either
you&#39;re either a mystic or you&#39;re a
scientist but you can&#39;t be someone who
is a conscious awake scientist and and
that I think as we go into the future
that&#39;s going to be a real change in our
society when we learn that we can be
both scientifically advanced but also
consciously
advanced I think doctors are getting
more permission to do that than they
used to very I know more than one doctor
who says well when I see somebody walk
in my office I scan them before I do a
thing anything I just look at them and
get a sense of where the problem lies
it should be a course in medical school
that would be a very good idea yeah yeah
someday someday maybe that&#39;ll happen it
you know mentioned before we started
behind your your shoulder there&#39;s a
paint drawing on the wall that we wanted
to talk about that&#39;s interesting I was
doing a series of remote viewing zhh
with Pat price a great psychic and our
task was to find what it looked like
where help put off was that they
traveled through South America he was on
vacation and each day at noon Pat price
would sit with me in our little shielded
room and it would say I see something
looks like a harbor or it looks like a
cathedral or looks like a market or
looks like a volcano and on day five he
didn&#39;t show up so this was an important
series of experiments is the first
formal series of long distance
experiments we did how was at Columbia
and it was 2,000 miles away in South
America
and saw price never showed up so I&#39;m
sitting there with my tape recorder or
not the record this is a remote viewing
with rust argh and Pat price for
describing where how put off is but
price isn&#39;t here
so I&#39;ll describe what I see and what I
saw was a airport on an island and I
drew an airport a runway as a dis sand
and grass on the right in an airport
building on the left and ocean at the
end of the runway hmm and if you can
blow that picture up you&#39;ll see that I
even wrote sand and grass on the right
ocean at the end of the runway and
that&#39;s exactly where it was our film and
third eye spies Hal confesses that he
thought he would trick the great psychic
Pat price because he price knew that he
was in enough interior country in
Colombia and price and Hal got a flight
out to the island called San Andreas to
see could price actually follow the
airplane out to the island right price
there but it shows that psychic
functioning is so easy that even a
scientist can do it yeah I just had to
sit down close my eyes I saw the runway
and I made a drawing of it and that&#39;s a
sharper drawing as anything we&#39;ve seen
in our program I don&#39;t put myself
forward of the psychic I just this is
just an interesting demonstration to
give the idea that this kind of psychic
functioning is not that hard to do if
you rise to the occasion it&#39;s they kind
of demand and as I described earlier
with the guy who scientist you couldn&#39;t
see anything I just okay it makes
something out your consciousness will
tell you what to draw
right and people can do this you know
when we&#39;re doing the Close Encounters of
the fifth kind out under the stars or
you can do it before you go out you can
just say you put
demand on yourself and you say this is
what I&#39;m going to intend to do and you
take that seriously and you can develop
this function with a team of people I
recommend that people do this with you
know three to eight people it doesn&#39;t
have to be a large group at all but that
you develop that and of course in this
case we&#39;re doing not just sensing and
remote viewing but we&#39;re also flipping
that around we&#39;re we&#39;re also then
connecting to those life-forms and
asking them to come to where we are and
there&#39;s a very very high correlation to
us doing that and various types of UFO
phenomenon and ET phenomenon happening
around us which by the way we have like
a hundred terabytes of this sort of
stuff and you see in this two-hour movie
a few things but it&#39;s it&#39;s so much
material and so many different types of
phenomenon and the other thing that that
I tell people this interest equally
interesting is events that happened
where they respond to your invitation
and it may not be particularly safe for
them to come in 3d but they may come in
in something closely approximating what
you what we&#39;re talking about with an
out-of-body experience but you can take
an entire spacecraft and it can shift
resonantly into from its aspect that is
material let&#39;s call it 3d solid into
something that approximates our astral
body and that doesn&#39;t have the
limitations of the speed of light and
that you know that now we&#39;re starting to
talk a little bit more about what the
interstellar technologies entail but
it&#39;s it&#39;s done technologically and can
be reproduced and so many people get
into this debate well are these things
interdimensional or are they
extraterrestrial I say well by
definition the ones that are et if
they&#39;re here have to be interdimensional
you cannot travel just at the speed of
light two and a half million light-years
from the Andromeda galaxy like that
ambassador that appeared at Joshua Tree
National Park a few years ago that we
have the photograph of us in the movie
that that ambassador was from Andromeda
and his name is Vishu and he introduced
himself very specifically and a lot of
the back and forth the way we would get
validation we were out there with
magnetic-field detectors that pick up
variations in the magnetic field that
you zero out in the wilderness to the
baseline magnetic field and whenever we
would ask something the the et would
then signal in a binary you know beep or
two beeps yes no about what we were
asking what do the Ambassador
communicates that he wanted what did he
let you know why he&#39;s here yes he was
here to establish an open contact with
humans but one of the key points I make
to people is that there aren&#39;t people in
the military and the United Nations or
the or the Foreign Ministries of
governments or our state department who
are doing this properly
therefore we need some pioneers that are
humans doing it until our governmental
officials approach this in a way that
isn&#39;t militaristic and violent and or
based on sort of some kind of strange
paranoia and war footing and that&#39;s one
of the real crises that we&#39;re facing
right now I mean I briefly mentioned it
on Fox News last night but you know we
only had a couple minutes with with
Laura Ingraham but one of the big
concerns I have is we&#39;re in and we&#39;re
already in a post global moment you know
I tell people that sort of the the
global mindset would have been quaint
and sort of avant-garde and in nineteen
ten or nineteen twenty or thirty we&#39;re
already at a stage where there are
intelligent civilizations concerned
about our development as we&#39;ve developed
nuclear weapons etc and so on and
they&#39;re here but they&#39;re wanting a what
the military&#39;s call a POC a point of
contact well what&#39;s their point of
contact going to be people who want to
approach them with a electromagnetic
pulse weapon system or humans that want
to open up a dialogue out of a sense of
commonality in conscious intelligent
life in the cosmos so we&#39;re trying to
answer that so this ambassador made it
very clear they came and there are all
kinds of cool phenomenon happened right
before that it&#39;s not in the movie but we
had take we were actually in circle
maybe 3040 people are out and we&#39;ve been
doing the sort of meditation and remote
viewing and the cg5 invitation protocols
for a couple hours and so we took a
break and I walked to the east down the
East from that site at the geology tour
road in Joshua national national park
you ever go there and when I was down
there with a few people on the team with
me suddenly there is this sphere almost
like a size of a grapefruit that
materialized right beside my right
shoulder and I saw and everyone saw it
and it came into this dimension and then
folded in the space-time and vanished
and I turned everyone I said they&#39;re
here and so I had a type it in prayer
bowl that I rang to get everyone back in
circle and as we were gathering in
circle we heard the four or five voices
speaking in the desert very clearly
because it now everyone&#39;s very quiet and
but where I had military grade you have
to do the Homeland Security paperwork to
get these night-vision scopes and I was
looking at
exactly where these four or five people
were talking and there was nothing there
with the visible naked eye they were
cloaked and but I asked someone sitting
beside me Nate Raven who is in the
documentary clothes marisa 15 I said
Raven right there take a photograph so
she just held her breath and took a
photograph and there&#39;s this ambassador
from the Andromeda galaxy floating right
outside where our chairs are and waving
to us no but it&#39;s an unfunny touched
photograph I was there I saw it but no
one ever saw that person when were
three-dimensional eyes we all heard them
how did you from Andromeda because we
asked where he was from and when I into
when I was telepathically told where he
was from I asked signal through our
magnetic field detector system whether
this is correct or not and and so it
kept we did a whole dialogue for maybe
45 minutes going back and forth that way
but intuitively I was receiving the
information quite accurately but I
wanted the group to be able to hear a
very specific confirmation utilizing the
magnetometer that we had out in the
field and so that&#39;s what we do it&#39;s
there are a whole lot of systems where
we have going simultaneously and that&#39;s
one of them we have electronic systems
but the that experience what it taught a
lot of people who were there is that and
then after that there was all this
phenomenon in the sky above us but at a
safe distance and at one point I think
we had 12 UFOs moving like objects in a
petri dish or moving almost like
organically above us up near of Orion
that we actually got a great video tape
of but there they were very high and
very small but they were you know
in various directions there and there
are a number of them so the other thing
I wanted to share with you about this
remote viewing you mentioned Ingo Swann
with Jupiter I don&#39;t know you know what
NORAD is the North American Air Defense
Command Cheyenne Mountain Inn near
Colorado Springs and you know it&#39;s
hardened facility inside a mountain and
some years before I met this man who had
worked there I had had this experience
with one of our ce-5 teams where we went
out into our solar system and it was
somewhere out near Saturn there was a
artificial object that was enormous not
thousands of feet across miles across
and I couldn&#39;t quite get the scape the
scale of it but I sensed that it was you
know a couple dozen miles in diameter
one object and my one of my military
advisors back in the 90s when I was
doing these briefings for the CIA
director and the head of the Defense
Intelligence Agency and people like that
I told him I described this object and
he just looked stunned and he said well
I was at Cheyenne Mountain years ago and
he was there&#39;s an area was console 50
that&#39;s in a classified area where they
tracked the interstellar vehicles that
are near Earth or out in our solar
system that come and go and he said that
he was in that room and and this is such
a sensitive area that if he was there
once when someone on the outside of the
corridor inside the mountain leaned on
the wall a German Shepherds and guys
with you know m16s
instantly appeared to get rid of that
person so you had that it was a very to
be read into that area it was a very
high classification it was an
unacknowledged special access project
area within Cheyenne Mountain
and I&#39;ve been there but he he said that
they were in there and they had tracked
now this is a Navy intelligence guy so
this is kind of funny but they had
tracked an object out in our solar
system out there that was 26 miles in
diameter and I&#39;m quoting moving under
its own steam I said well I&#39;m not sure
they&#39;re using steam however so that was
that was interesting because that was
years later a confirmation of what we
had seen and had a connection with this
out in our solar system but out in deep
space of this vehicle that seemed it
didn&#39;t seem like it could be an accurate
remote view because it was so huge it
seemed ridiculous I mean that would be
the size of the whole LA basin but it
was real and I later had a confirm by
this man with a TS SC eye clearance it
was in red into these unacknowledged
special access projects taps that in
fact there was such an object and I
later found out that some of the yup you
have to if you control of a technology
that allows you to make it transition
through space and time you can build the
thing as big as you want yes because
there&#39;s no the normal variations of you
know weight and velocity etc and so on
that goes away once you attain that
level of technological understanding of
nonlocality and also the nature of
space-time matter and the consciousness
field all of it when together we tend to
think of the material cosmos as being
something separate from what we&#39;ve been
talking about today with consciousness
and let&#39;s call it the astral concept you
know the out-of-body body of light but
the ancient if you look at the writings
in the ancient Sanskrit and the Vedas
the understanding is all this is that
meaning everything that exists is
actually conscious field phasing and
resonating as that object or as a photon
or star so there&#39;s this world of
non-duality
it&#39;s the non-duality and and we&#39;re very
trained in duality but in reality our
are our intellectual constructs don&#39;t
necessarily match the nature of reality
well let&#39;s beautify because neither
material and they&#39;re not Material crap
you go to a hard time with that right
right well with it yeah it&#39;s our nature
is their nature we&#39;re neither finite
you&#39;re infinite our bodies are our
bodies are finite governed by Einsteins
force race but our consciousness is
infinite right and there&#39;s an interplay
between the consciousness and the
conscious body of light and the physical
body that explains what they call the
city&#39;s sidd H is which include
teleportation levitation etc and so on
so what at one of the points I make to
people is that whatever we have
understood and say our mystical
literature or the experience of humanity
with people that who had very highly
developed skills in consciousness there
is a technological correlation to that
we are dealing with advanced
interstellar civilizations so the things
that we read about the same Yogananda&#39;s
book or the the cities of the ability to
teleport or by locate every one of those
abilities and powers that we ascribe to
very advanced consciously advanced
humans or enlightened masters is
actually a science and a technology in
an advanced interstellar civilization
and so this gets to be something where
we can you know it&#39;s like back to the
future because the things that have been
described in the literature going back
and by the way the Veda is we don&#39;t know
all those are they certainly predate
Buddhism Hinduism there it&#39;s as you know
Sanskrit is considered that the root
language of all indo-european languages
so we don&#39;t know how old that is it
could be tens of thousands of years old
it was an oral tradition until
relatively recently but the knowledge
that is in that tradition very much
deals with the fact that all of this all
the cosmos and three-dimensional
material world is actually consciousness
itself and there there is no separation
or duality it&#39;s just how we are
perceiving it
well Buddha&#39;s and the Buddha&#39;s riding in
the progeny Parramatta all throughout
that is the idea that there is no
separation consciousness consciousness
is a singular right and and I wish wrote
internship that Schrodinger&#39;s said that
you can&#39;t just misses a singular of
which there is no plural yeah it is
you know it kind of also reminds me of
that the Sufi saying knowledge knowledge
is a single point but the foolish have
multiplied it with well look I it&#39;s
getting late I want to thank you very
much dr. Targ and again you know his
movie if you guys it&#39;s on Amazon Prime
right this so it&#39;s called third eye
spies spies is streaming on Amazon great
great great so well hardly work out
released and I think you guys you did a
great job with it and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a
great review of the history and the
evolution of remote viewing and your
your experience with it with the CIA and
others thank you and one of the magical
things about the streaming on Amazon is
you can watch the film and it doesn&#39;t
cost anything well as you borned Amazon
Prime right exactly
or our movie is called third eye spies
yes very good well thank you again for
being with us and to everyone listening
I hope you guys will visit us at ce-5
film comm take a look at this
film that&#39;s out now close encounters of
the fifth kind and I hope you&#39;ll join us
and subscribe to this channel now that
we&#39;re sort of under quasi house arrest
we&#39;ll be you know I&#39;ll try to be doing
these more often than I than I used to
since I can&#39;t get out amongst you we&#39;ll
just do things from our living room
that&#39;s sounds happy to be with you
thanks for the opportunity thank you
have a good evening
bye bye solo I have one or we can I talk
to you uh
