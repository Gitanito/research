I listed in October 1st
1940 and retired in June 30th of 61
we hauled
uh nuclear weapons for these
Services delivered them all over the
world where they needed them oh yes you
you had to have a top secret clearance
to be in the
organization so you transported nuclear
weapons to theaters of operation on all
over the world where they might be
needed right with my first experience
with it was in
1952 could you describe what
happened I was on a flight from U
Seattle coming back to uh
Sacramento and it was between 10: and 12
midnight it was
clear dark
night and
sitting there looking ahead while I uh
saw this orange glow in front of
us and I a I didn&#39;t want to ask the
pilot if he saw it cuz I thought I was
just
tired and he did the same thing and
finally he couldn&#39;t wait no longer so he
asked me if I could see anything
unusual and I told him I could see this
red glow out in front of us
and he felt better and and he we watched
it and finally said well let&#39;s try to
catch up and see what it
is so we added power and uh we kept
getting closer and of course it got
larger until we got up over about
Reading
California and it uh went into a descent
and we followed it
and we uh picked up quite a bit of speed
in the shallow
dive and it went clear into Sacramento
and across the
city and right over the capital
building and we were right on it we had
the aircraft red line as fast as it
could
go and at that point it went
vertical and it disappeared in a matter
of two seconds straight up did you get a
good look at this we almost started to
make it out it was just getting larger
all the time but just to that point
where we thought we was going to another
minute wouldd see it that&#39;s when it took
off it was just a a large red
ball and it just the closer we got the
bigger it got and like I say it would
just start to take some kind of a shape
when it went vertical
1970s when we were involved with the Air
Force Reserve uh we were coming back
from
Germany in
c141 and we were at the time 35,000 plus
I can&#39;t remember the exact
altitude but round two hours out of do
Delaware and again it was a clear sky
except
dark uh we observe
this
uh object on a radar
screen and uh we had two of the uh
scopes on board Pilots had one and
Navigator had one and it was on both of
them it would come directly at us but we
could not see it visually
and then it would turn off and it made
several passes at us in fact one time it
came directly on our nose and so close
that the pilot took evasive
action at the same time there was a
civilian uh 747 off to our
right that we could
see so we contacted him and the pilots
talked back and forth and they were
seeing the same thing we were
seeing and they couldn&#39;t figure it
out and we called the controllers and
the states and they had nothing on their
screen so all they said
was to report when we
landed and we went in and uh we made it
there was pilot co-pilot Navigator and
two flight
engineers and we pilot wrote up what we
saw and we all uh signed the
statement and turned it in but that was
the last we ever heard the only one I
recall is the
uh second flight
engineer his name was L
Hobart roughly around
1957 50
eight yeah that&#39;s about when it had to
be uh seemed just about every day when
the weather was clear this was a summer
months we could look up at a certain
spot and we would see this round
object um we couldn&#39;t make it out was
too high and there was always just
before dusk settled
and as it started to get
dark objects would tumble out from all
around
it uh at least six possibly
more and they would start to descent and
then
disappear the whole thing would
disappear the next day would be the same
thing this went on for several
weeks um we tried to find out but the
only explanation ever given was it&#39;s a
weather
balloon now of
course it wasn&#39;t no weather balloon it
was too large and too high weather
balloons aren&#39;t that large that you
could see it from that altitude then
plus what were the objects that fell out
why did it
disappear and the location was well
where relative to the city of San Anton
was
it it&#39;s
right right close to U Kelly Air Force
Space and at that time your job in the
Air Force was what I I was in the uh
organization flying 124s carrying the
nuclear weapons quite a few saw
it did the smaller objects that came out
of it have any color that you can recall
they were dark that&#39;s about all I
remember about them they were dark and
uh much much smaller than the the larger
object did the larger object ever
move no seemed to just over one
spot and after the smaller objects came
out of it how long did it remain
visible only I would say about 2 minutes
after that it was was
gone and the uh civilian pallots and the
747 same thing they were looking they
could not see it but they had it on
radar how many passes were made at your
craft by this strange
object seems to me at least
four and could you reiterate how this
occurred um my understanding from your
previous description is that this object
was detected in the distance and then it
came rushing at you is that essentially
what what you experienced you just the
blip on the
screen at the furthest distance that we
had on our
scope
and by timing it the uh
Navigator he uh worked it out and he
said it was traveling
10,000
miles plus an
hour and it did it just come right
across that
screen and then turn off the last second
and then we wouldn&#39;t see it till it
would come at us
again and uh we try to find out if they
were having some type of uh missile
firing going on in the
area
and everything was always
negative
