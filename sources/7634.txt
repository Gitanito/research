  		              		Experience Description   

    All throughout the years that have past, I remember this experience as though it happened just now.

    I was working in a telephone business office/repair service center building in the Bronx where an elevated train runs.  There are two lanes in each direction, with one lane inside the El girders and one outside the girders.  There was also a parking lane on my side of the street.  I left the building for my coffee break at about 2:30 in the afternoon.  I usually took the shortcut across the square since the crosswalk was a ways up the block.  I walked between two parked cars  and to an area near a girder.  A blue passenger van didn't see me  and swung from the inside lane to get to the outside lane.  The mirror hit me and sent me  spinning backwards on my feet.  Then I saw a maroon van with silver painted bumpers coming at me in that lane.  My thought was, 'Oh S#IT, I'm dead.'  I felt nothing.

     Suddenly, I was up above myself and looking down at my body.  I had landed in-between two parked cars, and closer to the car parked in front than the one parked behind. I was  about a foot or so from the curb.  I was curled up on my left side with my face  looking out, toward the street.  It was a cloudy day and I looked up at the clouds.  It wasn't a tall building, so I could sort of see over it.  I was aware of something above me but didn't look up at it.  I  assume it was the train platform.  I had the most blissful feeling, like I could stay there forever.  I saw a man walking up the sidewalk as though he was walking toward me.  The way I was facing, it would had been impossible for me to see him coming.  Suddenly, a thought of my pregnant wife came to me and I said,'No, I can't go yet.'  This was the most convincing reality. In a flash, I dove back into my body, seeing myself as I got closer.  I happened  so fast.  

  I started to get up and that man was there to help me up.  He asked me what color was the truck?  I said maroon, not remembering the first was blue.  He helped me back into the building.  They took me into the office and called an ambulance.  They paramedics came and saw I had a two by two inch injury on the back of my head.  I found out days later that that man said I slipped on the curb.  I figure he's the one who hit me.  They took me to the  Hospital.  They undressed me when I told them it was a truck.  My whole left side of my body was black and blue so they scanned my entire body.  They found no broken bones or internal injuries.  I was in a lot of pain but insisted on going home.  They advised me to stay but I wanted to go home to my wife, so they let me go after I signed something.  I was driven home by supervisors. I was pretty banged up for about a week, having to mostly stay in bed.  I am a skeptic by nature but I know I left my body that day.  I've tried for a long time to poke holes at why or how this happened,  but I never could.  I know it happened.  My family knows about this.  I haven't told more then 5 people throughout my lifetime, because of the reaction shown when I told someone.  No one will ever convince me that this wasn't real.
