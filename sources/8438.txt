  Errata
  If any errors are identified in Evidence of the Afterlife: The Science of   Near-Death Experiences they will be posted here.&nbsp; 
  
  One errata: If you have a book with the back jacket (the paper covering   of the book) that begins with 'The First Near-Death Experience Research to be   Based...&quot; please be aware that the publisher made a mistake and published this   jacket without giving me a chance to review it.&nbsp; There are a number of   factual errors in this jacket, and a corrected jacket will be on the books after   the first printing.&nbsp; The book jacket issue does not affect any of the   content of the book.
  
  Another errata: On page 39, in account of 'Experience #16', I state the young   man &quot;collided with a brick wall&quot;, but the account quoted says he &quot;hit a tree&quot;.&nbsp;   Its a brick wall.&nbsp; Here is the original account that was paraphrased in the   book:   https://www.nderf.org/paul_b_nde.htm. 
  
  That's all the errata we are aware of.

FAQ
  If there are any Frequently  Asked   Questions that are, well,   frequently asked, they will be posted here (no FAQ   posted at this time).
