  		                4607.    Kathy O NDE     12/24/2018.      NDE 8711.            That's when he said to me, 'Suicides are not allowed to receive the light; they remain in darkness.' I don't know if he was using this as a scare tactic to frighten me, or if he was speaking the truth, but I wasn't going to question him. Then he spoke the words which I will never forget as he said, 'Life is a gift and it's not up to us to take it.'  
  NDE due to suicide attempt at age 16.   

    4606.    Jenifer L Probable NDE     12/24/2018.      Probable NDE 8709.       From the UK     Then, everything stopped because I had reached the destination. although I had been traveling fast, I didn't feel any motion sickness. In fact, I felt very at ease. I wasn't in any pain and I wasn't ill. This sounds corny, but it felt PERFECT. I felt total bliss, like I was very happy. I felt like I had no worries and no stress. This feeling intensified and at the same time, I was enveloped in a bright light. It felt like the light should be too bright for my eyes, however I had no need to squint. The only word I can best describe this light is the word 'beautiful.' I don't really know why I use that word because it's not a word I ever really use in my day to day life. 
  Probable NDE due to unknown intense illness at age 16. 

    4605.    Anna G NDE-Like     12/23/2018.      NDE-like 8706.            I had feelings of peace, calmness, pure love, and bliss all around me. What I saw was the most beautiful hue of a bright golden light all around me. The room, that was no kind of room, was a never-ending, soft hue of golden light with no walls. It was similar to a sunset in the clouds. It's so hard to explain. There was nothing around me. I remember feeling peaceful but still confused. I had my arms crossed and was walking around, trying to figure out where I was. Then, I heard a man's voice. I turned around and it was my husband smiling at me. At this moment, I did not know that he had been killed. He looked so happy and healthy. His hair was nicely cut, despite prior that day I was supposed to cut his hair but never got around to it. The confusing thing for me was that he had a long-sleeve, gold shirt on. I remember thinking, 'He never dresses like that.'  
  Severe car wreck. NDE-like, ADC from husband who died in accident at time she did not know he had died. NDE-like because she had been in the hospital for a week before having the experience. At that time, she was recovering and not in danger of dying anymore.   

    4604.    Steffi B Possible NDE     12/19/2018.      Possible NDE 8705.       From India. Non-Western Experience     I again fell unconscious and saw the entire process which as it was going to happen now. Some unknown voice told me, 'You knew all this is going to happen and you still chose to come here.' 
  Possible NDE due to being hit by car.   

    4603.    Dave B FDE     12/15/2018.      FDE 23327.            It was a primal fear where I knew that I was absolutely not in control of the situation and was going to die. Suddenly, I was watching my body from the perspective of my right side, about 5 feet away and just below normal viewing height. I saw my body enveloped by the flames and being thrown back from the pressure wave.   
  Fear-death experience at time of natural gas explosion.   

      4602.    Meghan NDE     12/15/2018.      NDE 8704.            I was unaware of this. I could physically feel myself running, although it didn’t feel like running anymore. I was floating, yet my feet were on the ground. I saw the very steep ditch on the other side of the road and I saw the dog running on the road, cutting back towards his house. I could see a truck stopped on the other side of me as I was beginning to run towards the dog again.  
  NDE with brief OBE due to being hit by car and also during surgery.   

      4601.    Kerry B NDEs     12/15/2018.      NDEs 8703.       Exceptional experience.     At that moment I looked up and saw my destination. I was looking in awe at God. It was like everything was happening at once. As I was staring up at God in amazement, every gay slur or violent act ever impressed upon me ran through me with such a flow. Events in my life played back in my mind like a movie. I felt a deep heaviness as I stared directly at an Almighty, Genderless God. I was thinking, 'Was this the Lake of Fire moment? Would I be cast into Hell for being an abomination?' With absolute humility, I uttered 7 words, 'I’m gay, will you still love me?'   
  Two NDEs.  One due to hate crime attack. Another due to anaphylactic reaction from unknown cause.  Remarkable discussion of her being gay with her deceased grandparents and God.   

    4600.    Jack J NDE     12/15/2018.      NDE 8702.            I never heard anything or paid too much attention at who was in the bed. I walked out of the room, through the door, and turned right into a waiting area. I saw my mom looking worried and my Dad was looking at a magazine. There was an end table between them with a green lamp between them. I stood there and heard my mom say to my Dad, 'Something is wrong.' My Dad looked up at my mom. She said, 'Something's wrong with Jack. I am going to see what's going on.'  
  NDE at age 6 during surgery.   

    4599.    Charles K NDE     12/15/2018.      NDE 8699.            Suddenly, I was up above myself and looking down at my body. I had landed in-between two parked cars, and closer to the car parked in front than the one parked behind. I was about a foot or so from the curb. I was curled up on my left side with my face looking out, toward the street. It was a cloudy day and I looked up at the clouds. It wasn't a tall building, so I could sort of see over it. I was aware of something above me but didn't look up at it.  
  NDE due to being struck by a van while walking.   

      4598.    Edward C NDE     12/10/2018.      NDE 8698.            I looked up to the clouds and noticed a beautiful bright light looking directly at me. The light was 10,000 times brighter than the sun, yet I could look straight at it. The light was literally made of LOVE. Everything I ever wanted was with the light and the light was Jesus Christ himself. I just knew it was him...  
  NDE due to episode of unconsciousness from unknown cause.   

      4597.    Catherine NDE     12/10/2018.      NDE 8697.       From the United Kingdom     I knew it was God. Then he was standing next to me. Immanuel God was with Me and I felt whole and complete in Him. It was a like a home-coming because I had been here before. I knew things without being told. For example, God was standing next to me with a crown made of lapis lazuli and pearls. I knew the crown was light although the pearls and lapis lazuli were heavy stones. He also had a white cloak for me in His hands. The white cloak was like a tunic. It was embroidered with many pearls of different sizes on the front part of the cloak. There was also another under-cloak for me in His other hand. The color of my cloak was a different mixture between purple and burgundy and was embroidered with very small gemstones. We don’t have that specific color on earth.   
  NDE due to pulmonary emboli.   

    4596.    Ashli NDEs     12/9/2018.      NDEs 8696.            I saw Jesus as the beautiful, bright familiar light of love again but this time behind him, there was a new presence I had never seen before. The presence filled the entire space or sky around us. It was like a horizon of spirit that was so gargantuan, like Jesus Christ times 20 billion. It was God!   
  NDEs due to two suicide attempts.   

      4595.    Zeliha B NDE     12/9/2018.      NDE 8695.       Non-Western NDE from Turkey. Original in Turkish, translated to English by Aylin.     This place was different. Everywhere there was lush green nature. It was a very peaceful place. I was very happy. There were green meadows and a train rail. In a distance, a train came very fast to where I was standing. The train stopped to pick me up. I wanted to get in the train and depart.  
  NDE due to faint after ceasarian section delivery.  Unusual in that living mother and new son were present.   
  
    4594.    Jon M NDE     12/7/2018.      NDE 8694.            I remember being engulfed in a peace and love. I can only describe this feeling by comparison. Imagine the best day you ever had and multiple that by a billion and that doesn't even come close to the feeling I felt.   
  NDE due to drowning.   

    4593.    Chris M NELE     11/28/2018.      NELE 8689.            It signalled the presence of my two Aunts. They had come to tell her to stop fighting and to let go. Mum told them that she wasn't going unless a part of her stayed within me. The same two comets or speed-of-light flashes shot back out of her chest, one after the other and through the same corner of the room. A peace filled the room.
  Shared nearing end of life experience with his mother who was dying.   

    4592.    Anni S NDE     11/27/2018.      NDE 16098.       Exceptional experience. From Denmark.  Original in Danish, translated to English by Karl.     I went to a peaceful place. It was so beautiful that I thought, 'The earth is like a film that hasn’t been developed. Not until we reach the other side, is the film developed,. Everything will be seen in beautiful colors that don't exist here on earth.' I saw a beautiful meadow. There were flowers and colors that were so fantastic that our earthly brain can't comprehend it. The colors we have here on earth are very pale in comparison to the colors I experienced in the spiritual realm.
  NDE due to trauma to the central nervous system from medical procedure.   

    4591.    Sabine G NDE     11/27/2018.      NDE 8685.       From Austria. Original in German. Translated to English by Marguy).     I found myself above my body. I felt so free and light. I had the inner conviction that I was in the state of real life. It seemed like my life on earth was more like role-playing. I could clearly see my environment there, which is normally, totally impossible for me to do without glasses. The colors were so much more intense and clear than on earth.  
  Nurse's NDE after fainting.   

    4590.    Jim B NDE     11/26/2018.      NDE 8688.            I do not have a life review like that usually reported. However, in considering what I believe may represent one, it makes me ask as to its purpose. Where it might be the same in function, if not in form. In that the gears I can see are the most probable emerging events within the egg representing my future, I believe these to be the fruit of my past, and my pain some measure of that as well, from a spiritual perspective. However, in that we can’t do anything about our past, my attention is directed to a different atonement- to simply take the net balance of my past as pain in which to guide future decisions to be better ones. And that provides the means to remove those things in my future, those probabilities, which I might be tempted to choose, even if they are attractive to an as yet unknown propensity of my mind.   
  NDE due to trauma from experimental plane crash.  Very long and remarkably complex experience with very atypical NDE content.  Includes much writing about what he learned from the experience.   

    4589.    Ute B NDE     11/26/2018.      NDE 8684.       From Germany. Original in German. Translated to English by Marguy).     I watched while two doctors tried to reanimate me. I kept thinking, 'You can't go now. You can't do this to mum. Last year Achim (my brother) and now me? I can't do this to mum.'  
  NDE due to heart attack.   

    4588.    Lyle H NDE     11/18/2018.      NDE 8681.            It was at this moment I realized I was probably dead. I felt peaceful and pain-free. The words she spoke were sorrowful and my heart ached for her. With a whoosh, I felt my self being shoved back into my body.  
  NDE with unconsciousness episode.  Shared 60 years later.   

    4587.    Lauren J NDE     11/15/2018.      NDE 8680.            What struck me the most, though, was the silence. The silence so complete, so unlike any other forest I'd ever been in my waking life. Normally, forests are almost as loud as cities with chirping birds and insects, rooting animals, the rustle of the wind in the leaves, leaves crunching underfoot, and water rushing in streams nearby. But here, the silence was anything but oppressive. It was liberating in a way. The earth was carpeted with a bed of soft leaves, somewhere between green and goldish-red in color. As though I was in the autumn of my life.   
  NDE due to cardiac arrest from unknown cause at age 29.   

  4586.    James G Probable NDE     11/15/2018.      Probable NDE 8679.            After further review of my life, I realized that I did do some altruistic acts toward other human beings, animals and plants. These acts were significant and meaningful, but they were not as many as I had hoped would be the case. Kindness that I showed toward people I cared about, toward animals in need or distress, toward helping the plants and oceans of Earth; these things mattered. I felt like I had wasted my life on trivial pursuits of material success, hedonism, and social esteem. All of these things were understood to be of no value and completely meaningless. Those things really did not matter. It was as though they never occurred. They were inconsequential. A great feeling of sadness overcame me at this point. My life was insignificant.  
  Probable NDE due to complications following surgery.   

    4585.    Chad B Probable NDE     11/13/2018.      Probable NDE 8678.            Then I heard a voice. But this time it was in English and I understood what he was saying. The voice was very powerful in tone, stern with instructions, yet compassionate in delivery. I remember he said, 'Ok Chad, it is time for you to go now. It is time for you to wake.' I remember responding, 'Why are you waking me? I am not ready to go. I don't want to go back!'   
  Probable NDE in recovery room after open heart surgery.   

    4584.    Christine S NDE     11/13/2018.      NDE 8677.            The next thing I remember was floating to the top of the gym's high ceiling. I saw myself and the whole gym from above. I was embarrassed as I thought, 'What am I doing on the floor?' Then I rushed back into my body, opened my eyes, and jumped up. 
  Brief NDE with OBE at time of gymnastics accident at age 11-12.   

    4583.    Cathy L Probable NDE     11/9/2018.      Probable NDE 8675.            Then I heard extremely loud, beautiful music that has no words to describe it. The music was all around me. The closest I can find to the music I heard is maybe from an orchestra without sharp tones, pianos, or etc. I was not scared and don't recall having a body or being in a place. It was just darkness. It felt immense love and joy all around, but those words are too limited for the experience. 
  Probable NDE due to suicide attempt.   

    4582.    Michael M NDE     11/7/2018.      NDE 8673.       From Canada     Then I was up near that gasket and I turned around. I was looking at myself. I saw the guys working on me and cutting my brown shirt off of me. I watched them frantically work. The scene below didn’t really interest me, so I moved along the roof of the ambulance and went to the passenger seat.   
  NDE at age 8 due to being run over by a truck.   

    4581.    Robert L FDE     11/4/2018.      FDE 8671.            The next thing I know, I’m in the air and looking at a square window or possibly a monitor? Everything is black around me. I feel myself standing there, but I can't imagine what my face looks like. It’s me in the screen. The car was speeding down the highway and hit the curb. The car hit the telephone pole hard.  
  Fear-death experience associated with car crash at age 17.   

    4580.    Rebecca R NDE     11/2/2018.      NDE 8670.            I was in the top right hand side of an ambulance and looking down at my body. I could read the thoughts of the emergency medical technician (EMT) who was with me. He was thinking that I was so young to die. When looking down at myself, I thought, 'Am I dying.' I then sensed a presence with me. The presence spoke to me in a kind and soothing female voice.   
  NDE due to anaphylactic allergic reaction.   

    4579.    Beverly F Possible NDE     10/28/2018.      Possible NDE 8667.            I saw my body lying below with my doctor and others around me. They looked so far away. I remember having to look around the surgery lights to see below. I could see that my pelvic region was being held open in a triangle shape. I remember knowing it was my body, but having absolutely no emotional connection to it or anything else. I wasn't aware of who I was, my life, children, or family. I do distinctly remember feeling like I was a child around age 6 or 7, full of bubbly joy.  
  Possible NDE during surgery.   

    4578.    Maria L NDE     10/28/2018.      NDE 8669.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Sean.     The suffering had evaporated, and a feeling of infinite peace enveloped me. I felt like I never wanted to leave this peace that filled me up. I knew that if they wanted to they could raise me up and take me from here whenever they wanted, but something was going on down below. I saw that my friend was screaming at me, and the nurses were acting as if there was an emergency. Although I didn't speak English, I knew perfectly well what was happening. 
  NDE during delivery.    Interesting that she was able to understand English during experience which she did not previously know.   

    4577.    Jystrup F Possible NDE     10/27/2018.      Possible NDE 8663.       From Denmark. Original in Danish, translated to English by David     I looked at my arm and was really amazed. It was made of light with a little corona around it. My whole body consisted of white light. Everything consisted of a white light. It was a body and then still it wasn't a body. It isn't easy to explain. I was thinking how beautiful it was. I wasn't afraid, but was very, very amazed. I looked out into space. It was dark, and I saw a white light getting close. It was going so fast that I don't know if I was going toward the light or the light was coming toward me. It was going really fast. 
  Possible NDE associated with operation.   

  4576.    Hanle P FDE     10/27/2018.      FDE 8668.       From South Africa     I was in a very warm, lovely place. I felt like I was held and safe. All the wonderful events of my short life flashed in front of me. One such event was when I was in preschool. I was walking hand in hand with my mother as we stopped at a big tree to look for fairies. There were other events, but I cannot remember them. What I do remember is that there was no fear whatsoever. I was in a very good and warm place.  
  Fear-death experience due to near drowning at age 8-9.   

    4575.    Samieh Y NDE     10/24/2018 &amp; 5/8/2018.      NDE 8664/8558.       Non-Western NDE From Iran. Translated from Persian by Amir.     I was not aware of my body anymore. I asked a lot of questions, like where am I and how I came here? But there was no answer. Then I realized that there is a void under me as well because I was not standing on anything. I mean the feeling we have on Earth that there is always something under your feet. That feeling was not there. Then I saw a very beautiful light that was shining on me even though it was far away from me. My surroundings and environment were still dark.  
  NDE at age 9.   

    4574.    Vicki H Possible NDE     10/24/2018.      Possible NDE 8665.            By now the ambulance arrived. They declared me clinically dead without breath and without a pulse. They performed CPR. I remember sitting on the emergency medical technician's (EMT's) lap with an oxygen mask as they all clapped and hugged me. I felt like I had climbed out of a tunnel and wanted to go back for some reason. My Mother said I appeared as if I was upset at the EMTs for waking me up.  
  Possible NDE at age four due to suffocation.  Shared 54 years later.   

    4573.    Karmen Possible NDE     10/24/2018.      Possible NDE 8662.            I was using it when suddenly a wave larger than I had expected swept me under the water. I remember floating under the water. I could feel it all around me. I was the most relaxed I have ever been in my entire life, before and since this day. Everything was super-calm. I remember wanting to just remain there forever. 
  Possible NDE due to drowning at age 8.   

    4572.    Dan M NDE     10/24/2018.      NDE 8661.            I saw a brilliant and beautiful light drawing me towards it. I tried to go toward the light but was unable to move toward it. I liken it to a real life diorama, where everything in my world was there but I was unable to get to it. There was no frustration on my part. I continued to try to reach the light. It was like a magnet drawing me in but I was not able to get as close as I wanted.  
  NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    4571.    Sandra M NDE     10/19/2018.      NDE 8659.       Exceptional Experience.     I went into the ground floor of the main house and straight into the cook's room. I saw the cook asleep on his stomach in his bed in his very small bedroom. The back of his head was facing me. I was floating against the wall at the foot of his bed. I screamed for him in a panic, but the words that came out - it was energy. That same instant, he startled me because he jumped out of the bed and ran out of the room. He made it to the threshold of the door that led to the yard. He fell to a sitting position with his hands on his head. 
  NDE due to drowning at age 5-6. Her screaming at the cook and having the communication wake him from a sound sleep because he felt like the room exploded is very remarkable because she described her words in the form of energy and it is a clear example of how the other side can communicate with the living.   

  4570.    Desmond H NDE     10/17/2018.      NDE 8658.            I found myself in a Dark Place that NDErs call 'the void.' I call it the 'Dark Place.' My time in the Dark Place was without emotion or thoughts, yet I was sentient. There was nothing to see, feel, or know in The Dark Place. I did not experience any emotions during the experience. I lost my personality, memories, and emotions. All of a sudden, a very loud voice spoke to me out of nowhere. The male voice loudly and slowly said, 'God.'  
  NDE due to asthma attack during surgery at age 15.   

    4569.    Ryan J NDE     10/17/2018.      NDE 8657.            I looked down and saw my own body on the operating table. I also saw the physicians reacting to the situation. In an instant, I was back to being under anesthesia. 
  Brief description of NDE due to apparent cardiac arrest during surgery at age 16.   

    4568.    Matthew S NDE     10/17/2018.      NDE 8655.            I was floating in the upper, back corner of the ambulance. The ambulance walls began to burn away. I can best describe it as watching a movie and the film begins to burn away as if the bulb is burning the film. Then, I floated out of the ambulance and above the road. There was a very strong, lighted Presence there. The surrounding sky and landscape began to burn away from the scene and was replaced by a vibrant landscape.  
  NDE  at age 10.  Shared 51 years later.   

    4567.    Donna J NDE     10/10/2018.      NDE 8653.            The next thing I know is that I am now above the road and to the right near the passenger side of my car and looking down on the accident. Cars were stopped, as there was really nowhere for them to go. A man whose face and description I do not remember, pulled my door open. He said 'Put her seat belt on before the cops get here.'  
  NDE at age 17 due to car accident.   

    4566.    Jenny L NDE     10/7/2018.      NDE 8651.            I was up in the top corner of the bathroom looking down on myself lying on the bathroom floor. I could see my mother moving my body. She was shaking my shoulders and gently slapping my face, as if to get me breathing again. I remember seeing a look of panic and fear on her face that I had never seen before. About as quick as I realized all of this, it was over. I do remember that while I was out of body, I felt a lightness about myself. I felt as if I was emptied of all the heaviness I carried every day. I felt a great sense of calm and peace.  
  Brief NDE due to unknown illness at age 17.   

    4565.    Jean C Probable NDE     10/7/2018.      Probable NDE 8649.       From France. Original in French, translated to English by Marguy.     At the end, I saw a light. I felt that I would be reborn, like a child that is coming out of the womb of its mother and who sees the light of day. I felt that I was going to come out of the womb. I caught sight of living forms in this light. I perceived sounds of life. I felt that beyond this light, I would start a new life and that his life was going to be happy and that there was much love. But at that moment, my 'birth' didn't happen, because I couldn't get out of the blackness of space and reach the light.  
  Probable NDE with reincarnation imagery.   

    4564.    Abby Jo O NDE-like     10/6/2018.      NDE-like 8650.       From the UK.     In any event, when I arrived at what I would now describe as perhaps a field of Light, or a cloud, the soul I was travelling with was greeted by someone who told me, 'Thank you for escorting him. Someone will meet with you shortly. Wait here.' I waited in the open arena/cloud and it was like being at a very big cocktail party but without bodies. There were hundreds of intense telepathic conversations going on all around me. I could 'tune in' to any of them I wanted to. It was very much like turning a dial on a radio or changing webpages on a computer. I could shift my focus and 'hear' telepathically any conversation I wanted to hear, on any topic, all happening simultaneously.  
  Remarkable SOBE that was NDE-like.  Involved returning the soul of a person who died of suicide to the afterlife.   

      4563.    Amy P SDE     10/6/2018.      SDE 23313.            A minute later, she breathed out and when she did, I breathed in. Immediately, it felt like my insides were filled with dry ice. It was a significant, physical, and breath-taking event where time stopped. Everything stopped. I don't know how long it stopped for, but it was a significant enough amount of time to have both the nurse and my husband reach me and both were standing next to me when I was able to exhale the breath. That was not a breath or anything else I could understand.  
  Shared death experience with mother who was dying. Also some nearing-end of life events toward the end. Amy has pictures. 
  
    4562.    Jo H NDE     10/2/2018.      NDE 8648.       Exceptional Experience.  From the UK.     I then became aware of my grandfather who passed in 2009. He was holding my head in his hands and he said to me 'Jo you are going to be fine, trust me. This has to happen now. You are going to be fine.' He didn't speak these words. Rather, I felt the words being passed from him to me through his hands which cushioned my head. Also present was my great grandma who hovered over my body with the palm of her hand pushing towards me. Somehow, she was signifying that it wasn't my time and I was to stay. 'Stay child' was her message. 
  NDE due to brain hemorrhage with remarkable healing.   

    4561.    Ron P Possible NDE     10/1/2018.      Possible NDE 23311.            The light was so bright that there is nothing on this earth that could match it. The sky and clouds were beautiful. I saw green pastures on the other side. The tall grass was so green and swaying from the nice breeze. There was a place like a shared area, so I approached it. As I drew closer, there was Jesus Christ!  
  Possible NDE due to alcohol poisoning.   

    4560.    Manuel M NDE     9/28/2018.      NDE 8647.            I felt that everything was in perfect order and I was free of any concern, pain, struggle or anxiety. I was totally aware of myself and of my identity. I was totally lucid and comfortable.  I did not have any memory of my life. I didn't remember anything or anyone.  I knew that I was dying, but it was my choice to die or not to die. I also knew that either choice was perfectly o.k. 
  NDE due to heart arrhythmia.   

    4559.    Paula D Possible NDE     9/20/2018.      Possible NDE 8643.            I then felt myself leave the bed and was up in a corner of the room. I watched the nurse continue placing the cold towels on my body. I'm not sure of the duration of the out of body experience but I remember being back in the bed and feeling the cold shocks.   
  SOBE, possible NDE at age 8 due to febrile illness in hospital.  Shared 62 years later.   

    4558.    Timothy V NDEs     9/16/2018.      NDEs 8640.       Exceptional Experiences.     I was instantly in this place of golden light and pure love. I was standing in this area of light without boundaries. The love was incredible! I saw a group of people made of light. I wondered who they were. As soon as I thought that, they instantly came to me. There were about a dozen people and two of them came closer to me. One of person was a beautiful woman with auburn hair. She was dressed in a white robe and radiated light from her being. She was powerful, in-charge but full of love. The love surrounded us and it was in us. We were all connected in the love light.  
  NDEs due to cardiac condition that periodically causes loss of consciousness.  Multiple detailed NDEs starting at age 17.   

      4557.    David S NDE     9/13/2018.      NDE 8637.      I was above and looking down at myself on the stretcher. I did not see what was happening to me or what the paramedic was doing. Instead, I saw my mom, who had passed away only a few months prior. She was sitting down. She was not upset or panicked. Rather she had a sense of being very calm and she had a quietness. Somehow we spoke to each other or rather she spoke to me.  
  NDE due to stroke.   

      4556.    Michiel W NDE     9/11/2018.      NDE 8635.            It was then that He spoke.  God said, “Do you want to live or die?”  I was immediately made to understand that the answer was not to be taken lightly.  I replied, “There are still some things I want to do, I want to live.”  God then said, “ Don’t worry, everything will be OK.”  
  NDE due to stabbing during criminal attack.   

   4554.    Holly P NDE     9/10/2018.      NDE 8633.            I had the sense of being pulled up and transitioning somewhere else. It was very bright, and I entered a field. Vivid green grass and blue sky, all of it rendered with such ethereal brightness, yet it was the feeling while there that is indescribable. Pure love, contentment and complete acceptance. This was home, I wanted to stay.  
  NDE due to suicide attempt.   

      4553.    Michael B NDE     9/9/2018.      NDE 8631.            I was in a black void. There I experienced no time, no pain, and no nothing. I generally felt like I was in a black room, yet I could not see any walls. I felt that there were several people around me at that time. I could not see anyone but I had a very strange feeling that I was not alone. I could not make out anything in this space. I could not see myself or others. I did not see any objects. I saw just pure blackness and a lack of any light. 
  NDE due to accidental narcotic medication overdose given in emergency room   

    4552.    Sanaz G NDE-Like     9/8/2018.      NDE-like 8628.       Non-Western NDE From Iran. Translated to English by Amir.     The light looked as usual, but this time it was alive. This light was a living entity and had a vibration, or flicker. I could feel its waves and its soul. I felt like something inside me was trying to connect with this light. I don’t know what it was—something in the center of my body. Then, without any reason, suddenly an overwhelming love encompassed me. I could feel its warmth. I learned a remarkable thing about this love. A knowing came to me that it had no reason for loving me—and yet it did! 
  STE, NDE-like after awaking from a nap.   

    4551.    Alison W Possible NDE     9/4/2018.      Possible NDE 8626.       From Scotland     The voice was kindly. I opened my eyes. At what would be waist level if I'd been standing up, there was a tunnel of light. It looked a bit like a vortex in the middle of the space by the right side of my bed. It was so soft looking, like down on a baby chick. It was the softest thing I have ever seen. There was a sense of movement, such that if you went into the tunnel, you'd be moved up.  
  Possible NDE due to septicemia.   

      4550.    Mark W Possible NDE     9/4/2018.      Possible NDE 8625.       From Ireland     I remember a lot of shouting going on but then something amazing happened.

  Possible NDE due to altercation.   

      4549.    Jacqui L NDE     9/2/2018.      NDE 8624.       From the UK.     Suddenly, I became aware of a tunnel. I started to move towards it, almost floating. I saw the most beautiful light and was being beckoned by someone or something. I knew instinctively that I was dying. I told the nurse 'I’m going to the light.' She panicked and kept shouting at me, 'Stay with me! Don’t go to the light!'  
  NDE due to eclampsia after childbirth.   

      4548.    Ruth P Possible NDE     9/2/2018.      Possible NDE 8623.       From Australia     he next thing I knew I was looking down at the bed from a corner of the room. Two doctors and several nurses were around the bed. I could see that two at the head of the bed had bags of blood. I saw myself as a "thing" in the bed and not important.  What was more important was in another corner of the room. I could hear a baby crying  
  Possible NDE due to complications of delivery.  Shared 55 years after experience.   

      4547.    Ray C Probable NDE     9/2/2018.      Probable NDE 8621.            Then I saw the light again. But this time, I understood that the light that I was looking at, was my own. Once I focused past the light, I understood everything. I felt the overwhelming feeling of everyone that has ever existed was focusing all of ther love at me all at once. There is no start or ending and there is no time in between. You can be anywhere or everywhere all at once. There is no hate or judgement. There is no pain. Everyone we ever knew here on earth is there. We are all equal there.   
  Probable NDE associated with surgery.  Not enough documentation of life-threatening event to definitively call this an NDE, but content entirely consistent with bona fide NDE.   

      4546.    Andrew B NDE     8/24/2018.      NDE 8620.       From the UK.      But I wasn't in my body and it felt like I was somewhere behind the bed and above myself. I remember a warm brightness above and around me. Someone was telling me, 'It is not your time yet. You're not ready.' It was dream-like and I can't remember a face. The voice was a calm, loving male voice but I don't know who it was. 
  NDE due to injury at age 13.   

    4545.    Amanda B NDE     8/20/2018.      NDE 23301.            I looked at my body like it was an interesting object. But otherwise, I was indifferent to it. Then I floated away. I say floated away because that's what it felt like. If I looked down, it was like there was no floor and if I looked up it was like there was no ceiling in this multiple-story hospital. I watched a lot of doctors and nurses trying desperately to get me back. I watched my body being repeatedly shocked and they gave me various drugs, but to no avail. I lost interest in the scene below and floated through a wall. When I came out the other side, I went right through my mom and aunt. They didn't have a clue that I had just come through the wall behind them and came straight through them both.  
  NDE due to suicide attempt by taking unspecified pill overdose at age 15.   

    4544.    Mai FDE     8/20/2018.      FDE 8619.       From Egypt     I was horrified and completely believed I was going to die. The next thing I knew, I was above the scene around 10 meters up. I was looking down at my car below as it was avoiding the collision and being driven safely through the two trucks. I was not afraid as I looked down.

I left my body, yet again, and shot off with such speed that this time I was already very far from home. I was seeing this beautiful blue planet, but terrified. I thought, 'This is getting worse and from here I am going to disappear from time.' I yelled for someone to get me out of here! As I kept rising, I saw that I was surrounded by darkness, as one sees the night. I watched my round, little planet with pretty hues. I saw everything beyond it.  
  NDE resulting from stroke.  Interesting multiple OBE episodes.   

    4542.    Bob H NDE     8/16/2018.      NDE 8617.            My hearing became extremely acute as did my usually fair eyesight. The doctors and nurses continually asked me what I was feeling as they performed their jobs. I described every feeling and vision I was experiencing in detail. I felt my life slipping away multiple times. When that happened, I'd tell my family I love them and it was time to go. I visioned the room and my physical body shrinking as my spirit was rising from my body. I saw many deceased friends and relatives looking at me and telling me it's ok.
  NDE less than a week ago due to heatstroke with multiple episodes of loss of consciousness in emergency room.   
  
      4541.    Kim M Probable NDE     8/12/2018.      Probable NDE 8614.        Reader discretion advised.     I just remember it was pitch black. I couldn’t see anything, but I could hear screaming and what sounded like big angry animals or devils. These were awful sounds. I can’t describe the smell, but the closest would be that it smelled rancid at best. I was unable to move. I could feel claws and teeth tearing at my skin. I was being eaten and torn to pieces. The pain was unimaginable. But I didn’t die. I couldn’t scream, nor could I get away.  
  Hellish and graphic probable NDE due to accidental medication overdose.

On waking up, I told my parents that I had seen people who I didn't know. They were calling me to go with them and then they were in the room calling me. My friend had died in that accident. Although I didn't remember anything, I had told my parents that my friend had come to visit me.  
  Possible NDE from motorbike accident.   

    4539.    Tina W NDE     8/6/2018.      NDE 8608.       From China. Original in Chinese, translated to English by Jenny.     I was floating up in mid-air and was suspended on the cerebal part of the brain. Then I saw a light that was brighter than the sunlight as it encompassed me. I could stared at it directly without hurting my eyes. Yet as comparing with my twitched body underneath, I felt extremely calm. Slowly, I walked around in the light and then asked, 'Where is this place?'

    4538.    Mache G NDE     8/4/2018.      NDE 8606.       Exceptional Experience.     I felt like I was part of everything and everyone. I just floated up and could see other rooms. I later detailed conversations that there is no way I could have known. I lifted out of the hospital and continued ascending. I began browsing through time. I saw events from my short life. I later detailed things that occured before I could even talk. These were events I should not be able to remember but I do and in great detail. As I kept ascending, I felt at peace. There were no questions or unknowns. Time wrapped in on itself. There was no past, present, or future as we see it here. Everything happened now and all at one time. I felt no fears or worries. I began drifting towards a beautiful light and I wanted to touch it. 
  NDE at age four due to cardiac arrest associated with severe illness.  Remarkable due to verified memories from earliest childhood during life review.      

    4537.    Alma B NDE     7/30/2018.      NDE 8604.       Exceptional Experience.     Suddenly, the huge white Orb of the Glistening Eye of God dims and a huge Golden-yellow Orb comes out from its right. I immediately sense that IT is the Light of Jesus. I am bathed in this Golden-yellow Light and healed, and healed, and healed even more. I cannot speak. It tells me, 'I Love you.' Its rays touched my body and I thought I would somehow be transported up those rays. They touched me and then the Golden-yellow Orb went back into the first huge white Orb, the Glistening Eye of God. A stone ledge then came out of the sky and a moving-art drawing of my life is presented to me. Then another, and another. I was having a life review. The drawings, where I was moving in them, were showing me that I was kind to people at different ages of my life.

It was a beautiful place that was neither cold nor warm. The ground was covered with white, round stone. In the middle, there were flowers resembling roses, but without the thorns. A bit further away there was a river whose water was perfectly transparent. The river wasn't deep. By the river, was a beautiful, white lady who asked me why I was crying.

    4535.    Douglas B NDE     7/25/2018.      NDE 8603.            There was light all around me. It was not especially bright or coming from any one place. The light was just everywhere around me. There was no glare, but the light illuminated everything without shadows. All around me, I felt a strong, yet calm, reassuring presence. Before me, I could see moving text. It looked like the credits one sees at the end of a movie. The text was scripture; scrolling upwards and away from me, and moving at a slow, smooth, and continuous pace.   
  NDE due to respiratory and cardiac compromise during a medical procedure.   

    4534.    Van S NDE     7/25/2018.      NDE 8600.            As I was moving the spot of light at the end of the tunnel grew in size. Then, I was in a large vaulted room with rays of light with golden specks that were suspended in the air like large dust particles. I saw hundreds of people standing around me. My recently deceased mother and my maternal grandmother were with them. I looked them in the eyes and felt at peace.

That night I remember being in a tunnel and moving towards the light with every step. I felt so much peace, and had great pleasure to go forward.

    4532.    Sharon T NDE     7/20/2018.      NDE 8597.            I had left my body and was looking at Sharon.  But she was not lying on the side of the pool.  Rather, she was lying in her bed in her bedroom at home.  I was floating near the ceiling in a very specific corner of my bedroom.  I was dressed in a white flowy gown, and there were two persons to my right also floating near the ceiling in white gowns. I saw them out of the corner of my eye.  One seemed to be Jesus, but the second person was partially blocked by the first. I wasn't looking right at their faces.

      4531.    Anthony M NDE     7/15/2018.      NDE 8596.            When I emerged on the other side of the light, it reminded me of a warm summer day that was very sunny; after a day where the colors of the sky, earth, trees, and flowers were very vivid. They were radiating with the moisture that came off the ground, only more vividly than I ever remembered before. It was an open field with flowers as bright as poppies where everything was painted because all was so vivid. There were other people running through the field with me.

    4530.    Charles T NDE     7/11/2018.      NDE 8594.            I saw a wall of the whitest of white clouds with a light emanating from them. I KNEW what was behind those clouds and I KNEW what the source of that light was, I KNEW it was Jesus! I saw Jesus riding the prettiest white horse I have ever seen. I couldn't take my eyes off of HIM. HE was riding very fast from my right to my left. We were travelling sideways and toward HIM at the same time. We got closer and HE looked over at us, held out HIS left hand, and said 'It is not your time.'  
  NDE due to heart attack with unconsciousness.  From contributor: “I do not refer to it as a NEAR death experience. I DIED TWICE.”
