  		              		Experience Description   

    I was riding a motorcycle on a four-lane street that was separated by a median that was between the four lanes.  I rode up to a car sitting in the right-hand lane with its left blinker on. The car turned in front of me and hit my motorcycle. I was thrown over the handlebars and sent  tumbling end over end. During the three rolls of my body, I became aware of being in a totally dark place and being completely still. There was no pain, no awareness of hot or cold, just complete peace and stillness. As my body stopped rolling, I was back in my body and aware of what had happened. If a car had been coming in the opposite direction on the road, I could have been killed.
