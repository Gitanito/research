I had many sleep problems.  I would stop breathing and wake up gasping for air. At the time, I did not know that this had a name. I only, not long ago, found out about sleep apnea.

 My sister and I shared a room. Our beds were side by side with almost no room in between them to move around. After waking up in the middle of the night, I remember sitting up on my bed and trying to reach the floor so that I can stand up. But for some reason I couldn't do it. The floor seem to get further and further away as I stretched my legs. So I decided to hop off my 3 foot high bed, until I noticed my feet never landed on the floor; Instead, I literally just floated.

I felt light as air. Then sensed a tugging feeling coming from my belly button and I started to slowly move toward my window; which was glowing a bright white light. As I looked down I noticed a cord; delicate, see through and sparkling, making its way from me, towards the light, passing forever into the non visible distance.’

So I turned to look at myself on the bed, and that is when I got sucked back into my body, in a micro-second.

And a great comforting sense of peace bathed over me. After, that's when I awoke once again gasping for air.
