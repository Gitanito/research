Some of us were being taught to swim and, confident in my success at dog paddling, I decided to swim to a wooden raft anchored about twenty feet off shore. I made it and after resting a few minutes on the raft, decided to try to swim to a second raft about sixty feet further out.

About halfway there, I began to struggle and went under. The next thing I was aware of, was being above my struggling body and watching it. Then somehow, I was in the presence of sort of a field of love that was totally wonderful. I felt like I was really 'HOME'. There were no beings that I can recall.  There was only peace, love, tranquility, and in at-home-ness feeling. Words cannot truly describe it. Next, I was seeing my mother weeping over my body. Then I woke up on the raft and people were pushing on me. I was angry that I was no longer in the field of love and tranquility.

This event was, as you can see, many years ago. I have told it as I remember it. There may have been more elements but they don't come to mind.

Yes     At the age of thirty my mother unexpectedly passed away while visiting my sister in a distant city.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    I was probably about forty-five or so when I stumbled upon some of the early research of NDEs. It was shortly after that that I began talking about it with others. Most were sort of 'ho-hum' about it, most thought it a product of my imagination.

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real     At that age, there was no reason to consider the experience unusual.
