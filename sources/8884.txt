  		              		Experience Description   

    I was at the lake with my friends. We were intoxicated. My girlfriend and I took the boat out on the lake.The boat flipped over  and in the water we went. I tried to swim to my girlfriend to bring her in to shore. She kept pulling me down under the water.  The third time, I stayed 3 feet under the water. I remember taking a deep breath, but it wasn't  air. It was water. 

  The next thing I know it was like a pop and I was out of my body. I was slowly rising up in the air. I looked down and saw the back of my body. I saw my girlfriend flailing in the water and my friends coming towards us. I remember being engulfed in a peace and love. I can only describe this feeling by comparison.  Imagine the best day you ever had and multiple that by a billion and that doesn't even come close to the feeling I felt. I had my consciousness with me and all the knowledge that I had acquired in my life. I don't know how I knew this, but I knew.

  Then  there was a pop.  I was on the dock with the paramedics working on me.  I was throwing up water. Then I  was taken to the hospital.
