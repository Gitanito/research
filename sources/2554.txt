  Besant (1847-1933) took over the Madras Standard to start this as the vehicle for her propaganda to free India from British rule and establish Home Rule.  She bequeathed the newspaper to Sri Ram in her will.  There may have been a lapse in publishing the journal from 1937-1947.  BL, NYPL, Columbia University, University of Wisconsin, etc.
