PREFACE.
IT is almost unnecessary to st;lte that the writer
has ever been, and is a sterling Protestant, conscien·
tiously-opposed to the views of the Catholic church;
·but has e\·cr condemned every weapon in defence of
religion, except the sword of the Spirit, the weapon
of truth. All the gentlemen mentioned in these pages,
as witnesses of the transactions hereinafter related,
are also sterling Protestants, and some of them Pro-
testant clergymen, active opposers of the church of
Rome; and some of them members of the Protestant
Association.
Moreover, the write!\,· up to this weelc, has been a
firm believer in the truth of the substantial facts re-
corded in Maria Monk's works; but now he entertains
no other opinion of the said Maria Monk's works, but
that they are, in every important statement, a mass
of barefaced fdlsehoods! and he has come to this con-
viction, not willingly, not hastily, not from the detec-
tion of any contradictions or mistakes in her works,
but reluctantly' !lispassionately' and from numerous
facts which he anu those Protestant gentlemen have
witnessed, which are now presenteu to the public,
signed most willingly by herself, in the presence of
those said Protestant gentlemen, whose names are
·

thereunto annexed, and which incontrovertibly prove
her to be, either an unfortunate lunatic, or a woman
destitute of all principle, and an adept in concocting
falsehoods, as she herself stated to one of those gen-
tlemen, "that site could, at any time, make and clear
up a mystery!"
Moreover, he is convinced, not only from her own
voluntary and solemn confessions, but from many
facts witnessed by those gentiemen, before alluded to,
that she has been the dupe of some designing person
or persons, to him unknown; who, while knowing
her to be one in whom no confidence could be placed,
were using her as a mere tool to fight popery, not for
the sake of truth, but for the sake of gain. Common
justice demands the protection of the slandered; and,
although the writer is, and ever will be, opposed in
religious views to the Roman Catholic church, yet he
is not more opposed to their religious views than he
is to the method adopted by this unfortunate woman,
and those persons to him unknown, to vilify and
blast the character of the clergymen of that church.
Lastly, He is convinced that the Rev. Dr. Brownlee
is neither directly nor indirectly implicated in any_
way whatever, with her deceptions; but, in his zeal
for the cause of Protestantism, has been most inno-
cently deceived by her and others. Every one who
knows him must believe that he would rather go to
the stake, than sanction any sort of imposition.
The writer is fully aware that by coming forward
with these statements, he is exposing himself to much
censure, and is doing that, which will greatly displease
..

many of his friends. But, having himself been the
vi•:tim of the bitter pen of calumny, he has a fellow-
feeling for those Catholic gentlemen anu ladies, (the
Nuns) from whom, however, much he may differ
in religious views, yet common just-ice demands their
protection and exoneration by him, iu whose hands
Providence has placed the means of incontrovertibly
proving their innocence; or what is the same thing
demonstrating that their accuser is one, in whose tes-
timony no 1·eliance whatever can be placed. More-
over it will be observed he attacks no one-he aceu-
ses uo one-that guilt has been somewhere, no one
can for a moment doubt; but with th:s he has nothing
to do: if he can exonerate the accuseu, and inuu('.e
those, who have innocently espoused her cause, to
withuraw forthwith, he consiuers he has done only his
duty to God-to the public-and to the cause of real
religion.
The principal gentlemen who witnessed the herein-
after mentioned facts and many other extraordinary
ones during her six days residence in Philadelphia,
and who have signeu as witnesses the documents
published in this tract, are,

ABDUCTION, &c.
CHAPTER I.
MARIA MONK'S ACCOUNT OF IIER ADDUCTION DY SJX
PRIESTS,-AND HER ARRIVAL IN PHILADELPHIA.
ON Wednesday, August the 1Gth, 1837, about ten
o'clock, A. l\'1. Maria Monk called at my residence,
285 Race St. Philadelphia, and informed me that she
had arrived in this city, the night before, from New
York, in the night line, in company with the Rev.
Messrs. Phelan, Dufresne, Martin, and three other
Roman Catholic Priests, with whose names she was
unacquainted. That she came here in consequence
of the persuasion of those gentlemen, particularly
Mr. Phelan, who, she said, had promised her four
thousand dollars, if she would accompany them to
Alexandria, and that he (Mr. Phelan) intended short·
ly to leave the Roman Catholic church, and marry
her. That none of her Protestant friends in New
York knew any thing about her coming off-that
these Priests conducted her on her arrival in this·city,
as before stated, at 12 o'clock at night, to the Catho-
lic Orphan Asylum, corner of Seventh and Spruce
Streets; to which she was conveyed in a carriage, in
8
which four of the Priests went, two of them walking
till they arrh·t:Hl at the said Asylum. And in that said
C:11lwlic Asylum, she slept on that uil;ht, (Tuesuny,
August 15th.)-'l'hat next morning she brenkfasteu
there with the Prieots. That the Uev. 1\'lr. Hughes,
said grace on that occMion. A bottle of bitters, made
of rum, she said, and some hitter stuff, having been
first sent rflunu the table. That., being in an adjoining
room some minutes afterwards, she overheard the
Priests conversing about her, and one of them said
"Damn her we have had trouble enough \\•ith her
already!" Upon which she left the Asylum, and
wan1lcring about the town, she saw the name of" Dr.
Sleigh" on the door of my residence, into which she
entered, ami made these statements.
The ubove is a summary of what she related to me
as her excuse for cnlliug at my house, and all of which
will be found substantiated by the other gentlemen,
to whom she afterwards repeated the same, as also by
tlte statements to the same effect, signed uy her.-
Heing somewhat astonished to see her, with whom
I was very little acquainted, enter my house, I said
"what! have you come off with those inen whom
you have stated to be murderers?"
"Oh, yes," she replied; "Phelan has promised me
four thousand dollars when we reach Alexandl'ia, aml
that he will shortly after marry me!" Forgetting for
the moment whom she meant by "Phelan," I said
"Pitelun!" "Yes," she replied, "Phelan, the father
of my child!" ..
" 'Yell Maria," said I, " if your book be true, you
are going to be destroyed!" "I am not at all afraid,"
said she; "I never saw the man yet of whom I wa1
afraid.

and others, that I am Mick of all this controversy. I
find I lmve gone from Catholic Jesuits to Protestant
Jesuits." "Has Dr. Brownlee," said I," ever ill used
you?" "Never, never," said she; "but the poor
Doctor, has been ueceived like myself. They have
all made well by my bqoks, and I can hardly get any
thing from them. Dr. Brownlee," continued she,
"has had, out of his own pocket to give me money
for my wants!" "To all this," I replied," I can give
you no advice. I have never mixed myself up in your
bu01iness; but for the sake of your friend Dr. Brownlee,
do let me send for a few of his friends, that they may
advise you; for recollect, if your book be true, you
are in a most dangerous position." She having con-
sented, I sent off for the Rev. Dr. Cuyler, who J.
knew was a particular friend of Dr. Brownlee, but
he was out of town. I then sent for several other
gentlemen, many of whom were also out of town.
While waiting for their coming she appeared very
impatient to be let go, stating that the Priests would
miss her from the Asylum, as she had only run out
to obtain some tooth ~che drops, and she must be
back at 12 o'clock.
I then asked her how those priests communicated
with her in New York. She said, they sent to her
a sister of charity, who induced her to consent to
meet Phelan in the street. This, she contined, she
did on Tuesday morning (August 15th,) and that he
persuaded her to accompany him to the asylum in
Prince street. There he held much conversation with
her, during which he observe~ to her, that as the Pro-
testant Committee were now about leaving town for
:\fontreal, to examine the Hotel Dieu Nunnery there,
10
that. if she accompanied the Committee they would
all be exposed anti ruinetl, and the Nunnery torn
down. By tlrese appeals to my feelings, and his
promise to marry me, I was intluced to leave New
York with them that evening, for Alexantlria.
My friend, Mr. Fenner, arriving, put an entl to this
conversation, and she having promisctl to return to my
house in the course of a short time, I received from
her the following order, in case she shoultl be de-
tained by the Priests:
"I, Maria Monk, formerly of the Montreal Nun-
nery, antl f..1m New York yestenlay, having come
to this city \\•ith father Phelan, Dnftesnc, and others,
do hereby authorise the bearers of this, to demand
me from the Orphan Asylum in this city, should
they deny that I am there."

Philadelphia, .!lugust 16th, 183~·.
I confess that I was apprehensive that she might
bP. tletained in the Asylum, and from thence might
be carrictl out of the city. I therefore requested Mr.
Fenner antl my cltlcst son ~o. follow antl watch her
going into the house, to remain ncar the building,

her absence the Rev. William Ramsay, Mr. W.
Scott, and other gentlemen arrived at my house, and
in the evening a regular "council of wm· was held."
Having prevailed on l\lrs. Sleigh to conser.t to her
remaining in our family till Dr. Brownlee arrived, I
offered her shelter till then; and forthwith wrote off
to Dr. Brownlee, informir.g him of her arrival here,
relatbg to him the substance of what she had told
me, and requesting him to come here immediately,
or give advice as to what was be·:t to be done.
On Thursday eveni11g I received an answer from
Dr. Brownlee informing me that he could not leave
New York, but that her guardian the Rev. Mr. Slo-
cum would come the next day: and at the same time
earnestly advising me to depend on nothing that coulu
not be satisfactorily proved. l\loi't of this day was
employeu in examining her, and endeavouring by
some means or oth&
t to ascertain the truth of her
statements: and to such an extent did she carry on
her ueception thnt the following letter '"aS Wri-tten by
her to the Rev. Mr. Phelan. ,
Dt:AR FATHER FELAN:-You are well acquainted
with the sutfcrings and dangers to which I have been
accustomed among our society. On this account, as
soon as I came to the Philadelphia Catholic Asylum,
at the corner of Spruce and Seventh, my suspicions
were excited, of evil intentions, among these Phila·
delphia Catholics. These suspicions were increased
by the effect produced by the drink which 1 got. I
have been suffering ever since, with sickness of the
stomach, so that I cannot again consent to put myself
into their hands. I have heen tossed upon an ocean
of temptation and uncertainty, about my present con-
'.
12
clition, and the course which I should accept for the
future. Shall I, or shall I not retu,·n to New York?
I cannot agree to progress with you, even if I should
recover from my present attack, unless you will give
me the most solemn assurances, that you are sincere
in your promises, and that you will not leave me to the
mercy of others. I know not what to do. If you have
any counsel to give, do not expect me to expose my-
self to personal danger again; you .must let me know
your plans, without any one else being present, or ac-
quainted with them. But, perhaps, you are ready
to give up such a nervous, worthless creature. If
you have any answer, I will call and pick it up at the
asylum.
(Signed) MARIA MONK.
. This letter was to be delivered by lier, in order to
get a dit·ect interview with the Rev. gentleman, that
he might be detected in her company; but by various
excuses, and by procrastinating from time to time,
she never took the letter.
Next day (Friday) the Rev. Mr. Slocum (Iter legal
guardian) arrived. He exhibited such a perfect indiffer-
ence, such an unaccountable lukewarmness about her
interest, that not one of the Protestant gentlemen
mentioned in these sheets, but lost all confidence in
him: and thr·y came to most unfavourable conclusions
respecting his conduct. It appeared to us he did
not now care one cent what became of her. Indeed
he stated to this effect in the presence ofseveral of us.
As we had now come to the determination (from
various strange occurrences,) to sift this business
thoroughly; to protect the innocent, and expose the
guilty: and, considering at this time that Maria. Monk

was only an unfortunate dupe, made the mere tool to
attack Popery, and to produce gain to som~ person,
or persons, to us unknown, we subjected the Rev.
gentleman to rather a severe examination; and on
his replying to a question put to him by Mr. Fenner,
to the effect, what was to become of Maria Monk,
when his guardianship would terminate; and what
would she then have to support her, from J.he receipts
of her works? he replied: " I don't know, what is to
become of her; and I don't think she will have any·
thing coming to her!" The perfectly indifferent man-
ner in which these words were expressed more than
shocked ns, and convinced us, that the unfortunate
Maria Monk ought to take legal advice immediately,
and be guided by some legal adviser. Accordingly, not
wishing to interfere in her pecuniary concerns, we de-
termined she should send f~ a lawyer, ami on my
recommendation, my talented and ~ighly honourable
friend, Mr. Constant Guillou1 was sent for. He
shortly came to her, and on her making a full state-
ment to him of all her affairs; the amount of money
Mr. Slocum had received, &c., he advised her to have
him arrested. No sooner said than done. The Rev.
.Mr. Slocum was arrested, on her oath, for two
thousand dollars, and remained in the custody of the
officer till near five o'clock: when he, not being able
to procure bail, Mr. Scott and I, not liking to see him
taken to prison, went bail for him, for two thousand
dollars each; he having first written to us the an-
nexed letter; the promises in which he did not fulfil.

Philadelphia, August 15, 1837.
He imowdiately started off for New York; and
Wednesday has passed without the fulfilment of his
solemn promise," as a clergyman and a man ofhonor!"
This day, however, I have received the following letter
from him, even without post paying it, or expressing
the smallest thanks to us, strangers to him, who saved
him from going to prison, by becoming security to the
amount of four thousand dollars!
New York, .!lugust 23, 1837.
DocT. SLEIGH:-Sir, the object of this note, is to
inform you, that Maria Monk has transmitted a letter
to her lawyer. directing him to suspend all further
proceedings in her suit against me, and of course,
has thus rendered it unnecessary for me to send on
the bonds of my brother. We have agreed to settle
on Saturday next; but should any thing occur to pre-
vent an amicable settlement, and should the fluit be re-
sumed again, you and Mr. Scott shall be indemnified
in respect to your obligations in my behalf. Please
inform Mr. Scott of the state of the case. Yours re-
spectfully, J. J. SLOCUM.
Mr. Guillou, the attorney therein alluded to, did not
up to Thursday evening receive the orders to sus-
pend the proceedings in the suit, which Mr. Slocum
states "Maria Monk has transmitted to him!"

On Saturday, we were still urging her to have this
whole business thoroughly investigated; but still with
some excuse or other she put us off. Now she wrote
the following letter, to the Rev. Mr. Phelan, the other
one being considered too long.
DR. FATHER FELAN:-1 am sure you are astonish-
ed at what has become of me since our arrival here.
Slocum came after me, but I had him arrested for
$2000 by my attorney, a good Catholic· gentleman.
I would be glad to speak to you any where, or at any
time you appoint. Yours,
M. MONK.
I will call for an answer, at 3 o'clock, to-day.
Saturday, .!lug. 19, 1837.
SuNDAY MORNING. Mr. Hogan arrived from New
York, with another letter from Dr. Brownlee to me,
and the annexed letter to Maria Monk, from Mr. A.
Bruce general agent of the Protestant Association,
which was handed to her in my presence, which was
found by one of my family in the presence of my eer-
vant, under her pillow, shortly after she had left for
New York on Monday afternoon.
Copy ofa letter addressed to " Miss Maria Monk,
at Dr. Sleigh's, Philadelphia:- Mv DEAR FRIEND:
I give thanks to God, that he has preserved you
hitherto from falling again into the snares of deceivers,
who would prove your dertroyers. For this I prayed
earnestly and constantly, since we parted that Tues-
day morning. If I had not then be~n so lame, I
would not have parted with you, tin l 1
1ad seen you
to the boat, and perhaps would have shared in the perils
of the voyage; but, perhaps, all this may turn out for
'
16
the better. My prayer to God is, that you yet be
brought out of all your troubles. I hope you draw
near to God for deliverance. I am glad that this will
be handed you, by our mutual friend Mr. Hogan.
Fear not to take his advice. You know him, and I
trust he is a friend that loveth. at all times, and a
brother in adversity, as Solomon says. Mr. Hogan
will tell you what I told him as to the pleasant and
profitable management of Miss Read's matters.!\ He
will also tell you what we concluded would be the
best way for you to recover your money, and get
your present affairs made straight by a committee,
who will render their best services gratuitously, both
for your sake, and the sake of truth. I was glad to
see your name written by yourself, to an article in
Dr. Sleigh's letter to Dr. Brownlee. If you think well
of this plan, it will have this good effect, that not
one of those who annoyed you formerly, will have it
in their power to do so then. And I feel very confi-
dent that various good results would follow.
I am, as ever, my dear friend, yours affectionately,
till we meet, which I hope will be soon.
(Signed) Aw. BRUCE."

in my house, in the morning of which day, I advised
her earnestly to take Dr. Brownlee's advice conveyed
in his letter brought by Mr. Hogan, that she should
return to New York rs soon as possible, .first having
it proved, beyond all possibility of doubt, that she was
brought here by Priests, at which advlCe she jumped
up.i~a rage, said we all wanted to get rid of her; that
she would not go to New York; she knew her own
business; but she would instantly quit my house,
which she accordingly did, fly~ng out in a passior~. All
this happened in the presence of Mr. Fenner, ·who
had just called in. He remained a short time to see if
she would return, which she accordingly did-consi-
derably cooled; and then upon our all requesting her
to do just as f'he pleased, she said she would go to
her legal adviser and w~atever he advised her, that
she would do. Accordingly she went to his office, at
which place, many of those gentlemen who had in-
terested themselves in her behalf, met and consulted
what was best to be done; her lawyer clearly set
forth the impropriety of going to New York until
after Wednesday. Then she came back doubly firm
in her determination not to go then, and remained in
that slate of mimi so positive, that she asked Mrs.
Sleigh if she could recommend her to a boarding
house, where she woald be safe. Mrs. S. mentioned
one private family which she thought might be induced
to receive her; and one boarding house for her con·
sideratior1. In this state ofmind she remained firm un-
til about two o'clock that day, when Mr. Hogan
- came and had an interview with her, the purport of
which I am not acquainted with, but so completely
2•
18
was she changed in mind, that we had as hot a con-
test to try to persuade her to take her lawyer's advice
and stay till after Wednesday, as we had in the morn-
ing to persuade her to go to New York. All our per-
suasions and the advice again given by her lawyer,
who kindly came to my house to advise her, were to
no purpose. Go she would.
I expostulated, over, and over again, against her
leaving Philadelphia before this extraordinary "abduc-
tion" was fully proved. I said, if it be true, that she
has been brought off from New York by the Priests,
there will be no occasion to go to Montreal, to exa-
mine the Hotel Diev Nunnery in that city; for no one
could then doubt the truth of her works; but if she
has not been now abducted, her character is for-
ever blasted! I also reminded her and Mr. Hogan,
that Dr. Brownlee, in his letter to me, most earnestly
implored us not to depend on her statement alone;
but, to do all in our power, to see whether she did or
did not state the truth. All would not do, she and
Hogan were determined not to remain nor to take
another step in the investigation, contrary to the ad-
vice of all the gentlemen, one only excepted, who
exerted themselves here in her behalf. Finding they
were determined to go, notwithstanding all our advice,
I then said, now come off at once to the Orphan Asy-
lum, and let us at all events, who have innocently
been drawn into this business, have some shelter
from the attacks which we may expect for protecting
her while in this city. She would not!-Then on
her going out of my house, I spoke thus: "Now,

STATE:\U.:NT (G) written by me, on her first visit to
my house, Wednesday, (August 16th) previous to my
consenting to her returning to ihe Asylum, and signed
by her.
(G) MARIA MoNK called on me this day, and made
the following statement: Th:\t she has arrived in this
city yesterday in company with Father Phelan, Du-
fresne, and Martin and three others, in the night line
from New York. That neither Dr. Brownlee nor
any of her Protestant friends knew any thing of her
coming off; that ::he was induced to do so, by the
- promise of Father Phelan and the others, that they
would &ive her four thousand dollar& if she would go
24
with them to Alexandria, and not go with the com-
mitte to Montreal to examine the Nunnery there; as
if she did, they would all be exposed and the Nun-
nery torn down. They don't want her to say any
thing against the Protestants; but only to keep quiet
for the future. She says she is under no restraint and
that she will be allowed to return out of the Nunnery
when she pleases.

Statement ( H ) was made next day by her, com-
mitted to paper by the Rev .,V. L. M'Calla, and duly
signed by her.
"I was induced a few days ago to leave New York
in the company of F~.ther Phelan, and five more Ro-
man priests. Father Phelan promised that if I woulu
remove with him to the South, he would secure me four
thousand dollars in cash, and his own hand in marriage,
as he intended to retire from the priesthood for that
purpose. On the way to this city, they gave me
something to drink which had a strange and evil ef-
fect upon my bodily health, and affected to a degree
the powers of my mind. They lodged me in the
St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum. In the morning I acci-
dentally overheard a priest saying to the company,
"Damn her, she has given us so much trouble," &c.
muttering enough to alarm me, and make me deter-
mine to seek other protection. I did so: but not
knowing what success the priests may yet have, in
decoying or kidnapping, or extracting disavo\vals, or

MARIA MONIC
Statement (I) of Mrs. Davy, 163 Chesnut Street,
Philadelphia, a Protestant lady of high respectability,
and the owner of the boarding house, to which
Maria Monk was first brought on her arrival in this
city.
(I) A young lady, giving her name as "Miss Jane
Howard," arrived at my house on Tuesday, August
15th, 1837, from the New York steamboat, at five
o'clock in the afternoon. She was recommended to
me by Mr. J. H. Jeffrey of New York, who in com-
pany with two or three ladies (his cousins) met her
alone on board the steamboat, and although not
knowing who she wa~;;, yet seeing her unprotected, re-
commended her to my house.
She slept that night (Tuesday) at my house, and
after having breali.fasted with me the next morning,
(Wednesday, August 16, 1837,) she went out, leaving
her bandbox in my care. In the evening of the next
day, she called, in company ,.;;ith a young gentleman,
and obtained the box-the young gentleman is now
present, in company with other gentlemen, and I un-
3
26
derstand, is Mr. W. C. Sleigh, and he states that the
same lady who obtained her band-box, and who rep-
resented herself to be "Miss Jane Howmd" wa&
".Miss Maria Monk." I would at any time, recog-
nise the same lady.
This has been read to Mrs. Davy, of 163 Chesnut
Street, and her daughter, who in our presence ac-
knowledged it to be correct and true.

Philadelphia, .flugust 23d, 1837.

entering we asked for the !ady who conducts the es-

'Vith her was another lady. "\Ve asked her if a young
lady had called on her the p1·evious \\iednesday, (16th

herf: that I really cannot recollect any one in particu-
lar." \\"e then described Maria Monk's person, when
she said, she recollected that such a person did call
and that the object of said call, was to know if she
could procure any situation as domestic, seam-
stress, etc.-Ft;rther she.(Maria Monk) had stated that
she was married-that her husband had left her at
some place, and that she had came on herself, anri
that he was now in some western part of the country.

The lady said she replied to Maria that she could not
allow her to reside in the Asylum-and that she did
not know of any situation. Maria then tleparted; but
in a short time (same morning) returned and tohl the
lady that she had met with gootl luck since, for
that she had heard from her husband and he had kind-
ly sent her a five hundred tlollar note, and would not
trouble her (the lady of the Asylum) further, or words
to that effect. And then applied for boarding in the
Institution which she was told she could not get. The
above is the principal purport of Maria Monk's visits,
as the lady told us. We then particularly aslwd her
if Maria had slept there the night previous, (Tuesday
15th,) to which she emphatically replied that no per-
sons but those under the charge of the sisters, cv€::
were allowed to sleep there; and that Maria did not
sleep there, nor was she, as she verily believed half
an hour in the Asylum if the time occupied in both
·visits were adtled together. 'Ve then asked her if
Maria had breakfasted there; to which the latly replied
as positively as before, that she had not, that no stran-
ger ever gets a crust, even, in the e!Stablishment, and
that.Maria most assuredly did not eat a morsel there.
\Ve then asketl the lady if Maria Monl;:, of whose name
and character the lady, at this time, a11d until our exami-
nation was concluded, was perfectly ignorant, had
left any clothes or things of any deseription there, to
which the aforesaid lady replied, as before, positively
in the negative. 'Ve then asked if she was gi\'en a
crucifix by the lady; to which we receivell an answer
unequivocally in the negutive. We then askeu the
lady if she had given l\1aria i\'lonk a lock of her hair,
and if she had taken a lock of hair in return from
..
28
her; to which the lauy replied with astonishment that
no such transaction had taken place.

CHAPTER IV.
SoME curious and incidental circumstances which
occurred during Maria Monk's six days stay in Phila-
delphia; with some additional statements made by her
during that time: published as committed to paper by
one of the gentlemen.
On 'Wednesday 16th inst., as Maria Monk was
walking down Chesnut street with one of the gentle-
men mentioned in these pages, a very respectable
personage saluted her; she instantly advanced towards
him and shook hands, saying at the same time to the
gentleman with whom she had been walking, "I will
find the way m:rself now; thank you Mr.-." And
having told him that she would speak to any of the
Priests she might meet, he, imagining that the gen-
tleman she had then met was onP of them, wished
her good evening and withdrew, leaving the sup-
posed priest talking to Maria Monk. As she had
intimated her determination to speak to any of the
priests she might meet, and resist all entreaties or
proffers to accompany him; and had also said she
would shout " murder," or " run him through" to
use her own expression, shoulu he attempt, once
more, forcibly to "abduct" her: no evil results were

apprehended as the consequences of this interview,
by the person with whom she had heen walking.
But still anxious to obsen·e the movements of the
gentleman, supposed by him to be a Catholic priest,
he walked on the·other side of the street and repassed
them unobserv~~ut they were still in close con-
versation. He now went through a street or two
and again arrived at the spot; but they had p:!rted!
or departed he knew not whither. On his return
home, after relating the incidents of his walk, it was
the opinion of all, that poor Maria was again far from
reach, perhaps immured in the dismal duugeon of the
Asylum awaiting her cruel fate, or, peradventure,
on her way, with priests, to Alexandria! The veil
of night was gradually surrounding all nature-the
sun had shed his parting rays, and had sunk behind
the distant hills-the gentle moon had
"Unveiled her peerless light,"
"And o'er the darlt her silver mantle threw."
yet Maria had not arrived: much solicitude was
felt for her, and every eye \'/as anxiously on the
alert, waiting for the restoration of the unfortunate
girl from the Popish fangs in which, it was feared,
she harl been left in Chesnut St! At last flhe returned
and W3S instantly accosted : y the gentleman above
alluded to as being with her, when the following
conversation took place. "'Veil, Maria, who was
that with whom I left you talking?"
She laughE-d and after a r.Joment replied, "'Vhy;
what makes yon ask me that question?"
Mr.-" 'Vas it priest Phelan?"
~he hesitated and equivocated, "'Vasn't he a hand-
eom• manT"
30
" Air.--" Yes, he was a good looking man; but tell
me, was it Phelan?"
" I dare not tell, I've sworn not to tell," replied she.
" But," she added after a moment, " if you guess
right you may."
Thus she left all under the impression that she had
been with a priest, and, moreover, that it was Phelan,
for the reflection flashed cross their minds, as they
aftetwards stated, that the query " wasn't he hand-
some'' related particularly to Mr. Phelan, who, she
said, had promised to marry her, and with whom,
they supposed, she was enamored.
That night happened to be one on which Dr. Sleigh
was to lecture against Infidelity, and as he had gone to
the Hall, where he was to 3peak, some time previous
to her return, she requested to be taken to hear him aml
it being already late, she and the same gentleman in-
stantly left for the place. Not being fully satisfied
with Maria's answers about the gentleman with
whom he had left her in Chesnut street, this gentle-
man (the one with whom she had been walking,
when she met the supposed priest,) resumed his in-
terrogatories on the way.
M. Monk. "Well Mr. -I'll tell you who it
was," and, after having designated the information as
a piece of great secrecy, ~>he continued, " It wa;;; Du-
fresne" (a priest.)
Mr.-" Well what did you say to ·priest Dufresne?
did he ask where you were? did he ask you who I
was, &c.?"
AI. Monk. "He asked me who you were, and I
told him, a friend of mine; he looked very suspi-
cious!y after ymt, and then said, that if the Protes- ·

tants were trying to get me that it would be useless,
for have me they (the priests) would, and the protcs-
tants would have the worst of it."
She then renewed the inquiry; " was he not hand-
some?" This she said was the purport of her inter·
view with the priest to whom she promised to return
to the Asylum the next day, but not that night as
she was at a friend's house. This gentleman, whom
she so artfully passed off for Priest Dufresne, was no
other than the gentleman who had paid her such polite
attention on board the boat and who had directed her
to Mrs. Davy's house, and who now, accidentally
meeting her in the street, stopped to speak to her!
Among other wonderful adventures Maria related
the following. While in New York she said that she
once " out offun," went in disguise to a Catholic
Priest to confess, and that she gravely told him
her greatest crime was reading "The awful Dis-
closures of Maria Monk!" The priest, she said, se-
verely reprimanded her for committing such a hei·
nons crime, and told her that it was a tissue of false-
hoods, and to convince her she related how he demon-
strated the fallacy, and exhibitedthe absurdity ofseveral
of the statements made in the book (little imagining that
he was actually addressing Maria Monk, and, innocent-
ly helping her to remodel her work.) Among other
things, she said, he told her that the writer proved her-
self to be an impostor by her attempt to describe the
ceremony of baptism as performed in the Roman Ca-
tholic church, for, said he, she has placed the usc of
salt in the wrong part of the performance of that rite,
and thus proved her ignorance of the matter of which
she was pretending to write. Maria tohlus that she
32
eaw the truth of the priest's remarks with respect to
the "salt," and other things, and that having listened
attentively to him she returnec.l home-took up her
pen, and, instantly, corrected her errors, plaeing the
salt " in the right place" &c. &c., for the next euition
of her book, according to the information given her
by the, thus duped, priest!
Another curious talc she favored us with was, that
two clergymen of New York had formed the project
of drcs:.ing her in a Nun's habit, and taking her to
lecture through the country, and that she was about
doing, and would positively have done so, had not
the Rev. Dr. Brownlee opposed it. With this plan
she appeared to be much taken, as on Monc.lay morn·
ing, when in Mr. Guillou's office with severai gentle-
men, she proposed carrying the scheme of the New
York clergymen into effect in Pehnsylvania as she said
she would like to do so now and asked Dr. Sleigh if
he would not be her motlerator!
One more extraordinary piece of information among
multifarious others with which she was tlaily and
hourly deluging her autlitors, is now recalletl to the
writer's memory, and he cannot refrain from placing
it in the reader's possession. As before related she
said she was kept in the Prince Street Catholic Asy-
hun New York for several hours previous to the tie~
parture of the boat for Philatlelphia lest she might be
tracetl. During her stay there she said that a gentle-
man with whom she had been acquainted walketl in.
She instantly turned her back to him, and kept so
whilst he was in the room. As soon as he had tle-
partetl the priest asked " why did you turn away
your face, my dear, from the gentleman!"

" Because," she replied, "I am ashamed to look
gentlemen in the face!"
"Right, my daughter, right," replied the priest;
" act always that way and you'll do well." The pecu-
liar manner in which she related this incident, and the
personification of the priest, produced an irresistible
risibility throughout the company.
Notes taken by the Rev. Wm. Ramsay.-
Among other statemeRts, he makes the following:
That he heard Maria Monk say that, some of those
concerned in publishing her books in New York, ad-
vised her to come away.
That Father Phelan promised to marry her, if she
would go with him; and offered her $4000 if she
would go with him to Alexandria: that he met her (or
a man supposed to be Father Phelan,) in Philadelphia
in Chestnut street, yesterday, (August 16th,) and after
a long converCJation, he said it was useless for her to
try to avoid them, (the Papists,) for they were deter-
mined to have her, go where she wculd.
That she slept in the Orphan's Asylum on the night
of the 15th, and in the morning, heard some of the
priests in an adjoining room say, "Damn her, we
have had trouble enough with her;" and on coming
into the room and seeing her, they were kind, they
were glad to see her, and expressed much good feel-
ing for her.
T}:lat Father Phelan said he would leave the
Romish church, and marry her; but he only wished
to get a little more money, before he did sc.
A discussion was held in the Orphan Asylum (as
Maria alleged) as to what should be done with: her;
some advised that she should go to Alexandr~a, . and
34
others, that ehe should stay in this city, under their
care.
In coming from New York in the steamboat,
Fatlter Phelan asker\ her, if she believed the priest
could give her absolution, at confession. She said
yes, for the purpose of hearing what lte would say.
He then replied that he did not, and never could,
while his conscience told him that it could not be so.
As to the conventual life, Father Phelan said, she
continued, he believed it was contrary to the word of
God; but as it was a part of the system of the Romish
church, it should be defended.
That $4000 were offered to Maria, not to go with
the committee to Montreal. These things she stated
in presence of several witnesses. W. R.n

CHAPTER V.
CONCLUSION.
BY what circumstance, or by whom, this nnfortu-
nate girl was first induced to fabricate her fables, aP'"
pears to me, as yet involved in mystery. Though
young in years, she is old in adversity. She cannot
be more than twenty-one, or twenty-two years of nge
at the utmost. She is a mother! What is now to be-
come·of her? My heart bleeds at the idea that deve-
loping the foregoing facts may canse her to be aban-
doned by all. If the slandered could have been ac-
quitted, or the innocent protected for the future, by

nny means, without at all impl'icating her, or relating
one circumstance prPjudicial to her character, gladly
would I have adopted that method, and studiously
would I have avoided relating a single fact calculated
to injure her: for I conceive refraining from accusing
anyone is as much the duty of the real Christian, as de-
fending, and protecting the innocent. "He, that is
without sin, let him first cast a stone at her!" (John
viii. 7.) But even common justice demands not only
the unjustly accused to be acquitted; but the public
protected for the future. She lately stated in the pre-
sence of several, that she was now composing another
work, far more wonderful than her " .lluful Disclo-
sures." \Vho were to figure in that unborn production
it would be difficult to say! Was her recent abduc-
tion from New York, and visit to Phil:'ldelphia to fur-
nish materials for it? One time she said she would
yet publish a work the title of which was to be " The
.llufal Disclosures ofProtestant Jesuitism!'' Who
could be safe, whilst such a person is at large?
There have been, or are, some person or persons
unknown to me, concerned in all this traffic, far more
culpable than this unfortunate, bewildered, unprotec·
ted girl. One of her friends (?) stated to several of
those gentlemen mentioned in this little work, that he
did not think, there would be scarcely any thing com-
ing to her, on the settling of her accounts; while ano·
ther said, she ought to have a share out of from twenty
to thirty thousand dollars, independently of the profits
of he1· books now selling in Europe! The fact is, to

ral years, that she could have been made to say, or con-
sent to, any thing; towhich circumstance, rather than
to any peculiar or natural depravity of mind, I am in-
clined to attribute the strange acts she has hitherto
performed.
Therefore, to cast her off unprotected, even with
plenty of money, would be inhuman, and lead to her
certain ruin. She really is not capable of taking care
of herself in consequence of her great mental excite·
ment. Is it not the duty of those immediately con-
nected with her, particularly those who have had
any thing to do with her pecuniary concerns, to
get her placed in Rome public Asylum, where,
being freed from anxiety, and excitement, and her
mind fed with wltole.'tome and pure nourishment,
she might, in a few years, become a worthy mem-
ber of society, and an instrument in the hands of
Pr~vidence of doing good:-and what, in my opinion,
would contribute much to this desirable end would be
the immediate restoration of her child to her; the ta-
king care of which would necessarily so occupy her
attention, and call forth into action such parental feel-
ings that she would not have time to be devising
schemes, or meditating on past events, however much
her present inclination may tend thereunto.
Finally, I have no hesitation in declaring my con·
viction, as a physician, that she is at present incapable
of taking proper care of herself-and that her own
good, a~d that of the public dem~d some measure to
be adopted, by which both objects may be secured•
