  		              		Experience Description   

    I remember the four hours it took to get me to surgery). My wife said I was in excruciating pain but I do not remember any pain. I remember telling her I couldn't feel my legs anymore and then I couldn't feel my left arm. I knew I was dying. I remember signing my own consent form. I finally was wheeled to the operating room.   

  I then left the earthly realm and entered into an alternate reality. I saw a lagoon that was surrounded by beautiful plants. Everything was soft to the touch. There  were 4 or 5 entities who were present, but  I could not see them. They assured me that everything would be all right and that I could leave anytime I wanted. They told me that this  place was for me and it contained all the Unconditional Love I had for others and that they had for me. 

  I did leave that place once but then came back. I asked why everything was soft and  was told that the energy that binds matter here is that of Unconditional Love. I laid down and the ground. The energy embraced me and the profound healing power of Unconditional Love healed me. 

  One of the doctors on the team that worked on me came to see me once I was alert. The doctor  was very nervous around me and told me that  she felt like she was  in the presence of a saint because I should be dead and nobody can explain how I survived. In surgery, I had  a dissected aortic arch that ruptured into my chest. During the aortic repair my brain was completely drained of blood and filled with cryogenic fluid. They used a new technique that is recommended for 60 to  90 minutes maximum. Yet, my brain was frozen for 100 minutes. I suffered ten brain clots and stroked at some time during surgery. My entire frontal lobe was a continuous bruise. 
  
  After a thorough brain scan, the doctor asked me how I was doing.  I told her that I was home from the hospital  and starting to do a lot of things. The doctor informed me that people with as much brain injury as I had, don't even get out of bed. Yet,  I felt fine except for some dizzy spells. 

  It has been 5 months now and I can run 12 miles. I'm a bit emotional but doing very well. I feel I have gained great insight into the nature of the universe, life and its purpose.    

Additional Question and Answers:    

Email from Dr. Long: 

    Thanks for sharing your remarkable near-death experience (NDE) with nderf.org!  It will be posted (anonymously) in the near future.  It is remarkable that you had your brain filled with cryogenic fluid during the surgery.  I had some questions, and would greatly appreciate it if you could answer them.  In what you shared you say:

  Anything more that you could share about your comment “I did leave once but came back” would be appreciated!  Where did you leave to and how did you come back?  You also said “I laid down and the ground embraced me and the profound healing power of Unconditional Love healed me.”  Anything more that you could share about that healing would be greatly appreciated!  In what you shared, you state “It seemed like several days went by but I was conscious post surgery the next day”.  At the very first time that you were conscious after the surgery, did you remember your experience?  Anything more that you could share about that would be appreciated!  Also, what hospital in Seattle did you have your surgery?  Interestingly one of the largest NDE groups in the country is in Seattle: http://www.seattleiands.org/.  

  Thanks again for sharing your remarkable NDE!  

  Kindest regards,

Email reply from Scott: 

  When I left and came back, I remember passing through veils or sheets of some kind of energy. I left because I'm not a trusting type and wanted to be sure I could leave. I went back to my real body in surgery; sorry I don't remember much of that. I did return again through the veils of energy but not right away. It took a little while.  

  Being that everything was soft, I sank into the plants and the ground.  It was like I sank into mud but it didn't feel gross. The energy of the whole place was healing but when I was on/in the ground, I was directly connected to it and I knew it could/would heal me. I was so relaxed and at peace. I hang on to that feeling and somewhat return there while I meditate. I somehow believe that I can still use that energy to heal myself as well as others. It's like the frequency of Unconditional Love can actually make physical changes to us on a molecular level and make things right and hold things right.  

  My memory after surgery is just that of occasional windows of what was happening, I didn't recognize my wife for almost 2 weeks. I was completely insane for most of the 2 weeks it took for me to recover my mind. It was very hard on everybody. I was chemically restrained as well as in 4 point physical restraints much of the time. I can't be sure exactly when my experience in the magical place ended and my experience in reality began or if there was an overlap. I just don't know, probably the drugs. Or my conscious mind was having a hard time finding my brain after all it had been through.     

    I have come to believe that Unconditional Love is a part of what holds this reality together as well and is the source of all healing     

    And thanks for the link, I will use it. Anything more just ask. It does me good to share. My Wife now refers to me as Scotty2.0 its the new version of me.

  Any further comments that you have on that would be greatly appreciated!  How did you become aware that you went back to your real body in surgery?  Please share anything that you might have seen/heard/felt/etc. regarding this part of your NDE.  Thanks!  And thanks again for sharing!  

  Best regards,

Email reply from Scott: 

    I simply felt that I went back to my body. I didn't really see my body clearly, it was like a sense of direction that this is where I had come from. I recall a vague memory of seeing a chaotic operating room. The veils I passed through, each one changed reality in some way and all of them together altered reality to create the healing reality at the lagoon that I enjoyed and took advantage of.  

  The thoughts your questionnaire have provoked in me are considerable. Thinking about the first in my body consciousness after surgery makes me realize how confusing it was coming back. The landmarks I use to be oriented in my brain could not be seen until I found them, thus re-orienting myself to my brain. I do not believe the conscious mind is dependent on the physical brain: I don't think it is even attached to it.  The consciousness only uses the brain to relate to a three dimensional reality. For me, it was like driving a car and then having all the controls changed as to what they do and having to re-learn what does what. The wasn't in regards to the movement of my physical body but in my thinking.  Even all my passwords and PIN numbers were gone but several times my hands still could log on and I had to watch myself to see what numbers I was pushing so I could write it down.
