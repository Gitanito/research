 This was the organ of the insurgent National Association of Free Psychics, a loose affiliation of psychics in western New York and Pennsylvania led by Richardson and headquartered in Buffalo.  Its complaint with the established spiritualist organizations seems to have been the latterâ€™s attempt to limit spiritualism to the spirits, to the exclusion of the development of "Psychic Power" and "psychic unfoldment."

Erhardt, et al., as well as by Alexander James-McIvor Tyndall, and extensive listings and directories of affiliated spiritualist and psychic congregations in the area.  The journal an advertisement for the "Syco-Graf," "the Psychic Machine; a Mechanical Ouija" with "dual revolving indicators" that "register micro-psychic impressions too delicate For other devices."
