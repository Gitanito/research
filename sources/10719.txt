  		              		Experience Description   

    It was winter.  I was walking on a snow bank that the grader made along the side of the road.  I slipped off the snow bank and slid on to the road.  I scrambled to get up but couldn’t.  I watched the truck drive over me.  I tasted mucus and then that was it. I was terrified for only a second.  

  Then the next thing I remember is  staring at the black rubber gasket where the fiberglass roof is sealed to the ambulance body.  Then I was up near that gasket  and I turned around. I was looking at myself.  I saw the guys working on me and cutting my brown shirt off of me. I  watched them frantically work.  The scene below  didn’t really interest me, so I moved along the roof of the ambulance and  went to the passenger seat.  I started talking to  the driver saying things like, 'Oh, that’s where I go to cub scouts'  as I was watching through the windshield as the ambulance was driving.  The  driver didn't hear me.  I felt no different as a person from being out of my body to  how I am now.  It’s like nothing changed.  Because I didn't feel any different, I was wondering why I was being ignored.  

  Then a man called me.  He was in the back of the ambulance.  'Micheal, come back here.  Michael, come back!'  So I floated along the roof and he was on the roof too, only he was on the inside of the roof.    He was at the back of the ambulance and I was at the front.  He asked me how I felt.  I said, 'I feel stupid.' as I was looking at my body.  He was invisible and had no form; he was only a voice.  So I stared at my body and I felt like I was being pulled from the roof down back into it. 

   The next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital.  I was busted up pretty bad with a  severe concussion, broken collar bone, ribs, arm, internal injuries, cuts, bruises, and etc.  I never really talked about my experience to anybody because I didn’t feel it was abnormal.  I thought this is just what happens when a truck hits you.  

  It was years after when I was around  17 years old.  I saw a show on TV and said to my mom, 'Oh, that’s exactly what happened to me.'  Everything  that that I saw on TV or read afterwards about NDE was accurate.  The most telling thing for me is that  nothing changed with me when I was out of my body.  I was the same then as I now am.    I didn’t feel one bit different.  

  Skills that I have are that I can really read people when I meet them. I have a really good sense of people.  I also don’t care about death and I think the funeral industry is a scam.  I also don’t care about status or climbing the ladder of success because  at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter.  I believe we transition and I’m 100% positive, proof positive that we do not die.  I also have proven sighting of future events before they happened.  All of these things are verifiable because I told people.  Nothing too exciting happened though.    I have visions while I’m doing things and they come true.  I see the exact event and then when the event comes, I say, 'Oh, I’ve already been here.'  I never get sad at funerals and I’ve been told it’s not normal for me to be so unsympathetic.  The only thing I really care about at a funeral is the lunch after. 

   I’ve also seen ghosts and I do have one in my house that visits my wife and I.  It turns lights on and off, fans on and off, and I see it standing or walking in the back yard.  I get a kick out of the scientists who say it’s just your brain as it dies.  Whatever.   Dying brains  don’t watch the road and buildings from the passenger seat;  they don’t watch people working on your body; and they don’t have conversations with invisible men.

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Catholic     

  Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I feel that a lot of what the bible says is bull.  But it also has some very good teachings  
  
What is your religion now?            I don’t practice in any organized religion  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     Nowhere in the bible does it say that nothing changes when you are out of your body or  that you can talk to somebody, or watch everything going on, or float around and see things away from your body.  
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     Nobody dies, regardless of their beliefs.    
  
  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   I talked to a man I could not see.  I know there was more to the conversation but I can’t remember it.  I should get hypnotized to see if that drags something out  of me.
  
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists       

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     I read this and it makes sense.  I am a spirit experiencing life in a human body,  not a human living a spiritual life  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I remember it perfectly like it just happened.  But I do think there was more chatting with the voice, but I don't remember all of the conversation.    
  
  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     Especially  if I really tap in by way of a therapy weekend.  It’s hard to turn off these experiences and it drives me nuts.  My psychic abilities with people are so powerful, I feel as though I’m totally invading their privacy.  I told my counselor. She agreed and believed every word I said.  I was in a group therapy weekend where my psychic abilities were ramped up and the day after the weekend, I knew every single person's issues when I wasn’t even told them.  I was so glad when it shut down.  It was like my mind was ten million times more powerful  
  
Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Not really.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I tell anybody who asks  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     But it was years after that I made the connections.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     Oh, it was real.  That’s for sure  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Not that I can think of  

  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         It’s good.
