    Here's my mom's near death experience.     

    In October of 2006, my mom had a massive heart attack and here is her near-death experience. My mom's heart attack began around 12:00 a.m. and kept going until 6:00 a.m. Why my dad waited so long to get help is beyond me. Around 6:00 a.m. my mom clutched her heart and said, 'I am dying' and fell onto the bed. Then my dad called the ambulance. According to the ambulance attendants they tried to jump start my mom's heart at least seven times. They brought her to the nearest hospital and the doctors told my family that she had ten minutes to live if they didn't clear the two blockages in her arteries. One was 98% and the other was 100% blocked. My family gave their permission for the procedure. For three days my mom was in critical condition. When I got the call I immediately headed to Arizona from Michigan.

 The first night that I was there I saw a spirit that was dressed in a butterfly dress coming into my room. I saw it with my natural eyes. Why is this significant? My mom used to love wearing a butterfly dress. When my mom had her heart attack I was still in Michigan and she had no idea that I was in Arizona.

 The first three days she was on a ventilator and she didn't know what was going on. After a couple weeks of many lows and very few highs, my mom began to improve to the point of being able to talk. She began to tell me about what happened to her during the first three days. Here is what happened:

When she fell onto the bed she said her spirit left her body. She told me that she was sitting in the front seat of the ambulance and that there was a female driver. This was later verified. She told me the road they went down and what hospital they came to. This was also verified. She also told me that her spirit was walking through the hospital, came into the waiting room, and saw us sitting there. She named everyone who was there and told me that we were eating Subway sandwiches and cookies. There is no way that she could have known this. She also came up to me and tried to touch me, but remember...she didn't know that I was in Arizona at the time. Afterward, during our conversations she told me that she wasn't afraid to die anymore and things on this earth didn't really mean anything. She seemed to be a different person, more loving and caring.

 Because they waited so long to get her help, my mom ended up with congestive heart failure, which led to her death in February of 2007. My two sisters told me that they could feel the spirit of death in her room for two weeks. It was weird because she knew that she was going to die. She would say things like, 'When I am gone, I want you to continue on with your lives.' After my mom's death, my two sisters and I felt her presence on more than one occasion. This lasted for a few days and then it just stopped. I know that she is happy in heaven and I know that she is waiting for me. 

I love you mom!
