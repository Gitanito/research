  On Heindel, see the note under Echoes from Mount Ecclesia.   He claimed initiation at the hands of "an Elder Brother of the Rosicrucians" in 1907 on a mountain top in Germany--possibly Rudolf Steiner--and returned to the United States to propagate, in anticipation of the imminent return of the real Rosicrucians, his own mixture of astrology and Theosophical root races (which produced a strange vision of racial immaturity and degeneration: "the pioneers of the human life wave, evolving on earth, in the Western World, clothed in bodies having a white skin, and we speak of them as older souls because they are older in experience, while the so-called inferior races, such as the Hindus, Negroes, Chinese, etc., may be called younger souls because they are young in experience and development").  The journal was continued and edited by his widow, Augusta Foss Heindel, after his death in 1919.  There were regular contributions to the journal by Manley Palmer Hall, who was a regular visitor to Oceanside and a student of Augusta's, and of course by Ella Wheeler Wilcox.  The community and the journal supported themselves with mail-order lessons and Spiritual Healing.
