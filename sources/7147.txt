Glen Rein earned a BSc degree in psychology from the University of Waterloo in Canada and later completed his PhD in biochemistry at the University of London in 1983. Following this, he held an assistant professorship at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York, where he conducted research in the field of bioelectromagnetics. From 1987 to 1993, he worked as a researcher at Stanford Medical Center, focusing on neuropeptides.

Rein's diverse educational and research background served as a foundation for his exploration of bioenergy, which began in 2009. His work bears similarities to parapsychological research on bio-PK (bio-psychokinesis) and encompasses experiments aimed at understanding how consciousness and intention can influence biological systems. This research includes innovative experiments that examine the effects of thought and intention on the structure of DNA molecules.

Recently, Rein has formed Glee Biologics, which is developing water-based commercial products imprinted with energetic information for nutraceutical and agricultural applications.  Influencing DNA

In a series of publications from 1994 and 1996, Rein and Rollin McCraty detail experiments investigating the influence of human intention on DNA molecules contained within a quartz cuvette. Rein and McCraty found clear-cut changes in the UV absorption spectra (between 260 nm and 310 nm) of DNA solutions before and after exposure to intention, suggesting that human consciousness can increase the rate of DNA unwinding. These findings corroborate previous research that found human intention can substantially modify DNA conformation. Different subjects elicited diverse conformational changes, as evidenced in the UV absorption spectra. In certain instances, following intention, a reduction in UV absorption at 260 nm, indicative of DNA winding, was observed.1
