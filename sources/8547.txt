  Introduction

  Much of the discussion of out-of-body   experiences has centered around the recounting of experiences and speculation on   the nature of those experiences. Some articles have questioned whether the   experiences are of an hallucinatory nature or purely a function of biochemical   processes that occur in the brain, and, at the other extreme, some have linked   them with notions of the existence of an immortal soul and other ideas generally   associated with religious interpretations of human existence. Most readers are   intrigued by the thought of being able to have and control OBEs, and see them as   a potentially interesting experience, though some smaller number of people   taking part in discussions are interested in trying to figure out their nature   and function and their possible implications for the understanding of what it   means to be fully human.

    What is an out experience?

  Out-of-body-experiences (OBEs) are those   curious, and usually brief experiences in which a person's consciousness seems   to depart from his or her body, enabling observation of the world from a point   of view other than that of the physical body and by means other than those of   the physical senses. Thus, an out-of-the-body experience can initially be   defined as 'an experience in which a person seems to perceive the world from a   location outside his physical body [ In some cases experients claim that they   'saw' and 'heard things (objects which were really there, events and   conversations which really took place) which could not have seen or heard from   the actual positions of their bodies.

  OBEs are surprisingly common; different   surveys have yielded somewhat different results, but some estimates indicate   that somewhere between one person in ten and one person in twenty is likely to   have had such an experience at least once, Furthermore it seems that OBEs can   occur to anyone in almost any circumstances. Researchers have approached the   question of the timing of OBEs by asking people who claim to have had OBEs to   describe when they happened. In one of these, over 85 percent of those surveyed   said they had had OBEs while they were resting, sleeping or dreaming [Bla84].   Other surveys also show that the majority of OBEs occur when people are in bed,   ill, or resting, with a smaller percentage coming while the person is drugged or   medicated [ Gre68a, Poy75]. But they can occur during almost any kind of   activity. Green cites a couple of cases in which motor cyclists, riding at   speed, suddenly found themselves floating above their machines looking down on   their own bodies still driving along. Accidents did not ensue. Pilots of   high-flying airplanes (perhaps affected by absence of vibration, and uniformity   of sensory stimulation) have similarly found themselves apparently outside their   aircraft struggling to get in. One might well struggle frantically under such   circumstances.

  More curious still are reciprocal cases of   OBE and apparition: the OBE subject, aware that he is operating in some kind of   duplicate body, travels to a distant location where he sees a person and is   aware of being seen by that person this person confirms that he saw an   apparition of the OBEer at the time that the OBEer claimed to be in his   presence. Thus the two experiences corroborate each other.

  Not all OBEs occur spontaneously. Using   various techniques, some people have apparently cultivated the faculty of   inducing them more or less as desired, and a number have written detailed   accounts of their experiences. These accounts do not always in all respects   square with accounts given by persons who have undergone spontaneous OBEs. For   instance the great majority of those who experience OBEs voluntarily state that   they find themselves still embodied, but in a body whose shape, external   characteristics, and spatial location are easily altered at will, and an   appreciable number refer to an elastic 'silver cord' joining their new body to   their old one. A much smaller percentage of those who undergo spontaneous OBEs   mention being embodied, and some specifically state that they found themselves   disembodied. The 'silver cord' is quite rarely mentioned. It is hard to avoid   suspecting that many features of self- induced OBEs are determined by the   subject's reading and his antecedent expectations.

  Common aspects of the experience include   being in an 'out-of-body' body much like the physical one, feeling a sense of   energy, feeling vibrations, and hearing strange loud noises [GT84], Sometimes a   sensation of bodily paralysis precedes the OBE [Sal82, Irw88, MC29, Fox62]. OBEs,   especially spontaneous ones, are often very vivid, and resemble everyday waking   experiences rather than dreams, and they may make a considerable impression on   those who undergo them. Such persons may find it hard to believe that they did   not in fact leave their bodies, and they may draw the conclusion that we possess   a separable soul, perhaps linked to a second body, which will survive in a state   of full consciousness, perhaps even of enhanced consciousness, after death.   Death would be, as it were, an OBE in which one did not succeed in getting back   into one's body.

  Such conclusions present themselves even more   forcefully to the minds of those who have undergone a 'near-death experience'   (NDE). It is not uncommon for persons who have been to the brink of death and   returned following, say, a heart stoppage or serious injuries from an accident   to report an experience (commonly of a great vividness and impressiveness) as of   leaving their bodies, and traveling (often in a duplicate body) to the border of   a new and wonderful realm. Reports suggest that the conscious self s awareness   outside the body is not only unimpaired but enhanced: events which occurred   during the period of unconsciousness are described in accurate detail and   confirmed by those present. The subject sometimes 'hears' the doctor pronouncing   him dead when he feels intensely alive and free from physical pain, and finds   himself returning unwillingly to the constrictions of the physical body. If OBEs   show the capacity of the conscious self to have experiences and perceptions   outside the physical body, near-death experiences seem to suggest that this   capacity still obtains when the physical body is totally unconscious.

  The idea that we all have a double seems to   spring naturally out of that of the OBE. If you seem to be leaving your physical   body and observing things from outside it then it seems natural to assume that,   at least temporarily, you had a double. It also seems obvious that this double   could see, hear, think and move. This interpretation is not necessarily valid.   As Palmer has so carefully pointed out [Pal78a] the experience of being out of   the body is not equivalent to the fact of being out.

  According to the English psychologist Susan   Blackmore the definition of the OBE as an experience may not be a perfect   definition but one of its major advantages is that it does not imply any   particular interpretation of the OBE. The consequences of this definition are   important. First, since the OBE is an experience, then if someone says he has   had an OBE we have to believe him. Conceivably in the future we might find ways   of measuring, or establishing external criteria for, the OBE, but at the moment   we can only take a person's word for it. Another related consequence is that the   OBE is not some kind of psychic phenomenon. As Palmer has explained, The OBE is   neither potentially nor actually a psychic phenomenon.' This view is a natural   consequence of any experiential definition. A private experience can take any   form you like. This experience may turn out to be one associated with ESP and   paranormal events, but it may not.

  What are  ESP, PK   and psi?

  'Extrasensory perception' (ESP) is a term   coined by Dr. J. B. Rhine of Duke University.&nbsp; It covers any instance of   the apparent acquisition of non inferential knowledge of matters of fact without   the use of the known sense organs. ESP is usually said to have three varieties:   'telepathy,' in which the knowledge is of events in another person's mind,   'clairvoyance,' in which the knowledge is of physical objects or states of   affairs; and 'precognition' (telepathic or clairvoyant), where the knowledge   relates to happenings still in the future. The word 'knowledge' is, however, not   entirely appropriate, for there may be telepathic or clairvoyant 'interaction,'   in which a person's mental state or actions may be influenced by an external   state of affairs, though he does not 'know' or 'cognize' it.

  Another American term is 'psychokinesis' (PK),   the direct influence of mental events on physical events external to the agent's   body. 'Psi' (from the Greek letter) is 'a general term to identify personal   factors or processes in nature which transcend accepted laws' [Gay74]. It is   sometimes used to cover both ESP and PK.

  What theories   have been put forward to account for the OBE?

  The notion of the human double has a long and   colorful history. Plato gave us an early idea. He believed that what we see in   this life is only a dim reflection of what the spirit could see if it were   released from the physical. Imprisoned in a gross physical body, the spirit is   restricted; separated from that body, it would be able to converse freely with   the spirits of the departed, and see things more clearly. Another idea which can   be traced to the Greeks is that we have second body. The spirit or some subtle   body would be able to see better without its body. Aristotle taught that the   spirit could leave the body and that it is capable of communicating with the   spirits, while Plotinus held that all souls must be separable from their   physical bodies. This 'doctrine of the subtle body' runs through Western   tradition.

  Homer regarded man as a composite being   comprising three distinct entities, namely the body (soma), the 'psyche,' and   the thumos; this last term is untranslatable, but is always closely associated   with the diaphragm/midriff (phrenes), which was considered to be the seat of the   will and feeling, perhaps even of the intellect. At this stage (800 - 750 BC)   the term psyche had not come to mean personal soul, but rather it represented   the impersonal life which dwells in the body but which is unrelated to the   intellect and the emotions. A fourth component, the 'image' ('eidolon'), might   also be included in human make-up; it was this aspect of self which acted and   appeared in dreams, where it was considered as a real figure.

  Dionysus' early followers in Thrace reenacted   his death and resurrection in a gruesome ceremony, where they tore a live bull   to pieces with their teeth, and then roamed about the woods shouting   frantically. Later rituals were hardly less barbaric and frenzied; all were   calculated to induce a stage of religious madness or mania. They took place at   night to the accompaniment of loud music and cymbals, thus exciting the chorus   of worshippers who soon joined in with shouts of their own. Dancing was so   violent that no breath was left for singing, and eventually the worshippers   induced through their excesses a state of such exaltation and rapture that it   seemed to them that the ordinary limits of life had been transcended, that they   were 'possessed,' their soul having temporarily left the body. The soul was in a   condition of enthousiasmos (inside the god) and ekstasis (outside the body;   liberated from the confines of the body it enjoyed communion with the god.

  Perhaps the most pervasive idea relating to   other bodies is that on death we leave our physical body and take on some   subtler or higher form, This notion has roots not only in Greek thought and in   much of later philosophy, but also in many religious teachings. Some Eastern   religions include specific doctrines on the forms and abilities of other bodies   and the nature of other worlds; and in Christianity there are references to a   spiritual body. Some religious works can be seen as preparing the soul for its   transition at death.

  The Tibetan Book of the Dead, or Bardo Thodol   (meaning Liberation by Hearing on the After-Death Plane) was first committed to   writing in the eighth century AD, although the editor, Dr W. Y. Evans-Wentz, has   no doubt that it represents 'the record of belief of innumerable generations in   a state of existence after death.' It is thought that its teachings were   initially handed down orally, then finally compiled and recorded by a number of   authors. The book is used as a funeral ritual, and is read out as a guide to the   recently deceased. It contains an elaborate description of the moment of death,   the stages of mind experienced by the deceased at various stages of post-mortem   existence, and the path to liberation or rebirth, as the case may be.

  The Bardo body, also referred to as the   desire- or propensity-body, is formed of matter in an invisible and etheral-like   state and is, in this tradition, believed to be an exact duplicate of the human   body, from which it is separated in the process of death. Retained in the Bardo   body are the consciousness- principle and the psychic nervous system (the   counterpart, for the psychic or Bardo body, of the physical nervous system of   the human body) [Eva60] Due to its nature, the Bardo body is able to pass   through matter, which is only solid and impenetrable to the senses, but not to   the instruments of modern physics; and the fact that the conscious self is not   embedded in matter enables it to travel instantly where it desires. Flights of   the imagination become objectively real, the wish comes true.

  In his introductions to The Egyptian Book of   the Dead - called in the language of that people 'Pert Em Hru' ('Emerging by   Day') -- Wallis Budge points out that its chapters 'are a mirror in which are   reflected most of the beliefs of the various races which went to build up the   Egyptians of history.' As all commentators have hastened to indicate, the Book   of the Dead is not a unity but a collection of chapters of varying lengths and   dating from different ages. A selection of these would be made for the deceased,   and would be copied on the walls of the tomb or inscribed on the sides of the   sarcophagi; or they might even be written on scrolls of papyri which were then   laid within the folds of the body cloths. The extracts meant to benefit the   deceased in a variety of ways.

  In the Egyptian Book of the Dead the   perishable physical body, preservable only by mummification, is called the khat.   Next comes the ka, which is generally translated as 'double,' and is defined by   Wallis Budge as 'an abstract individuality or personality which possessed the   form and attributes of the man to whom it belonged, and, though its normal   dwelling place was in the tomb with the body, it could wander about at will; it   was independent of the man and could go and dwell in any statue of him.'

  The ba, or heart is depicted as a bird and is   often translated as 'souL' It is sometimes conceived of as an animating   principle within the body, but elsewhere it is hinted that one only becomes a ba   after death, when it either dwells with the ka in the tomb or with Ra or Osiris   in heaven. The ha is often referred to in connection with the spiritual soul (khu),   which was regarded as imperishable and existed in the spiritual body (sahu). The   sahu was originally considered to be a more material body, and may have formed a   part of an early and literal view of the resurrection, whereby the sahu, ba, ka,   khaibit (shadow) and ikhu (vital force) all came together again after 3,000   years, and the man was reanimated. Gradually the sahu came to be regarded as   more spiritual in its compositions, and the idea of physical resurrection lost   its prominence. It was believed that this sahu was germinated from the physical   body, provided that it was not corrupt, and that the appropriate ceremonies had   been performed by the priests.

  The Egyptians agree with the Primitives and   the Tibetans in asserting a form of continued existence after physical death,   Their notions are less psychologically consistent and subtle than those of the   Tibetans, but much more complex and symbolically developed than those of the   Primitives, whom they resemble only in the earliest stages of their   civilization. Their unique features center round the overwhelming dread of   physical corruption and corresponding longing for the germination of the   indestructible sahu in which the khu will exist 'for millions and millions of   years.'

  One of the directly relevant ideas derives   from the teachings of Theosophy. Within a scheme involving several planes and   several bodies, the OBE is interpreted as a projection of the 'astral body from   the physical body. Theosophical ideas have influenced the thinking and   terminology of many OBE researchers since many people reporting OBEs have found   terms like 'astral projection' which derive from Theosophy to be useful in   describing their experiences. Other researchers, however, find such terminology   and the model it has been devised to describe to be unnecessarily biased in   favor of a certain 'esoteric' interpretation of the actual experiences.

  The idea that we have a double also appears   in popular mythology. Often these doubles have sinister overtones, or are   associated with the darker side of the psyche, but usually they are supposed to   be quite harmless. These phenomena seem to be related to the OBE in that they   involve a double, but there the resemblance ends.

  Dean Sheils [She78] compared the beliefs of   over 60 different cultures by referring to special files kept for   anthropological research. Of 54 cultures for which some information was   reported, 25 (or 46%) claimed that most or all people could travel outside the   physical body under certain conditions. A further 23 (or 43%) claimed that a few   of their number were able to do so, and only three cultures expressed no belief   in anything of this nature. In a further three cultures the possibility of OBEs   was admitted but the proportion of people who could experience it was not given.   From this evidence, we can conclude that some form of a belief in out   experiences is very common in various cultures.

  Apparently, as many cultures interpret dreams   as OBEs as those which do not. The notion that one may induce an OBE   deliberately is not entirely absent from the cultures included by Sheils, though   it is usually confined to certain types of people. Often only shamans can   achieve OBEs, sometimes by using special drugs or methods for inducing a trance.   Of those cultures described by Sheils, there were several in which there was a   common belief that the soul could travel in earthly places, while in others the   general belief was that the soul could only move in the world of the dead or   spirits, and in others both kinds of soul travel were accepted.

  There are stories of bilocation in which the   physical body exists and acts in two separate places at once. But physical   effects in OBE are rare. Also related to OBEs are the phenomena of traveling   clairvoyance, ESP projection and remote viewing. 'Traveling clairvoyance was   used to describe a form of clairvoyance in which a medium or sensitive seemed to   observe a distant place, therefore it included both OBEs and experiences in   which the clairvoyant 'perceived' the distant scene but without any experience   of leaving the body. In both 'traveling clairvoyance' and 'ESP projection' the   occurrence of ESP is presupposed, but the experience of leaving the body is not.   Remote viewing is a recent and better-defined term. Typically a subject   describes or draws his impressions while an 'outbound experimenter' visits   randomly selected remote locations. Later the descriptions and the locations are   matched up. Remote viewing has often been compared with OBEs, and sometimes   subjects who can have OBEs are used in remote viewing experiments.

  Many people have argued that the OBE itself   is some kind of dream and involves no double other than an imaginary one.   However, an ordinary dream does not have those important features of the   experient seeming to leave the body and being conscious of perceiving things as   they occur. in this sense OBEs are better compared with lucid dreams, which are   dreams in which the sleeper realizes, at the time, that he or she is dreaming.   In such an experience, the sleeper may become perfectly conscious in the dream,   which makes the experience very much like an OBE.

  The experience of seeing one's own double has   been called 'autoscopy' or 'autoscopic hallucinations.' Here again the double is   not the 'real' or conscious person. It is seen as another self, but the original   self still appears the most real. In the OBE it is the 'other' which seems most   alive.

  It has been argued that the OBE is an   hallucination, and any other body or double is likewise hallucinatory. There are   in fact many similarities between some kinds of hallucinations and OBEs.

  Among other experiences difficult to   disentangle from OBEs are a variety of religious and transcendental experiences.   People may feel that they have grown very large or very small, becoming one with   the Universe or God. Everything is seen in a new perspective, and may seem   'real' for the very first time. It is difficult to draw a line between a   religious experience and an OBE and any line one does draw may seem artificial   or arbitrary.

  What is an astral   projection?

  Superficially, the idea of having a double   may seem to explain the OBE. However, as soon as this idea is pursued, problems   become obvious and the system has to get more complicated to deal with those   problems. One of the most complex, and certainly the most influential, of such   systems is the theory of astral projection, based on the teachings of theosophy.   In 1875 Madame Blavatsky founded the Theosophical Society in New York, to study   Eastern religions and science. From her teachings, brought back from her travels   in India and elsewhere, a complex scheme evolved. According to the Theosophists,   man is not just the product of his physical body, but is instead thought to be a   complex creature consisting of many bodies, each finer and more subtle than the   one 'below' it. These bodies should be thought of as an outer garment which can   be thrown off to reveal the true man within.

  Although there are variations in the details,   it is commonly claimed that there are seven great planes and seven corresponding   bodies or vehicles. The grossest of all is the physical body, of flesh, with   which we are all familiar. There is supposed to be another body also described   as physical known as the 'etheric double,' or 'vehicle of vitality.' Etheric   double is the manifestation of physical vitality, it is constant and does not   change throughout the cycles of life and death, but it is not eternal, for it is   eventually re-absorbed into the elements of which it is composed. This 'double'   acts as a kind of transmitter of energy, keeping the lower physical body in   contact with the higher bodies. Etheric substance is seen as an extension of the   physical.

  Next up the scale is supposed to be the   'astral world' and its associated 'astral body', or the 'vehicle of   consciousness'. These entities are thought to be finer than their etheric   counterparts and correspondingly harder to see. Astral body is thought to be 'a   replica of the physical body (the gross body), but of a more subtle and tenuous   substance, penetrating every nerve, fiber and cell of the physical organism, and   constantly in a supersensitive state of vibration and pulsation' [Gay74].

  The astral world consists of astral matter,   and all physical objects have a replica in the astral. There is therefore a   complete physical copy of everything in the astral world, but in addition there   are things in the astral which have no counterpart in the physical. There are   thought forms created by human thought, elementals and the lowest of the dead,   who have gone no further since they left the physical world. All these entities   and many others are used in ritual magic, and thought forms can be specially   created to carry out tasks such as healing, carrying messages, or gaining   information.

  In the scheme just described, those who have   the ability are supposed to be able to see the nature of a person's thoughts by   changes in the color and form of the astral body. All around the physical can be   seen the bright and shining colors of the larger astral body, making up the   astral aura. The aura is multi-colored and brilliant, or dull, according to the   character or quality of the person and therefore 'to the seer, the aura of a   person is an index to his hidden propensities' [Gay74].

  All these conceptions are of special   relevance because of the fact that the astral body is supposed to be able to   separate from the physical and travel without it. Since the astral is the   vehicle of consciousness, it is this body which is aware, not the physical. It   is said that in sleep the astral body leaves the sleeping body. In the   undeveloped person, little memory is retained and the astral body is vague and   its travels are limited and directionless, but in the trained person the astral   can be controlled, can travel great distances in sleep, and can even be   projected from the physical body at will. It is this which is called astral   projection.

  In astral projection the consciousness can   travel almost without limitation, but it travels in the astral world, It   therefore sees not the physical objects, but their astral counterparts, and in   addition the beings that live in the astral realms. The astral world has been   known as the 'world of illusion' or world of thoughts. The unwary traveler can   become confused by the power of his own imaginings. In this state one can   appear, as an apparition to anyone who has 'astral sight.' Indeed one can appear   to other too, but to do so requires some involvement of lower matter, for   example of etheric matter, as in ectoplasm. Ectoplasm is considered to be the   materialization of the astral body and is described as 'matter which is   invisible and impalpable in its primary state, but assuming the state of a   vapor, liquid or solid, according to its stage of condensation' [Gay74].

  An aspect of astral traveling which has   become important in later writings, though it appears little in early theosophy,   is the silver cord. It is held that in life the astral body is connected to its   physical body by an infinitely elastic but strong cord, of a flowing and   delicate silver color. Traditionally the cord must remain connected or death   will ensue. As one approaches death, the astral gradually loosens itself, lifts   up above the physical, and then the cord breaks to allow the higher bodies to   leave. Death is thus seen as a form of permanent astral projection.

  Beyond the astral, Theosophy distinguishes a   further five levels. These include the mental or devachnic world, the buddhic,   the nirvanic, and two others so far beyond our understanding that they are   rarely described. The task of every person is to progress through all of these.

    Is astral projection an   adequate explanation?

  Many investigators are convinced of the   reality of astral projection. Among the best known are Muldoon and Carrington,   and Crookall. Sylvan Muldoon claimed to be able to project at will and described   his experiences in The Projection of the Astral Body [MC29] written in   collaboration with the psychical researcher Hereward Carrington. Together these   two collected many cases of spontaneous OBEs which they amassed as support for   the reality of astral projection. Many years later Robert Crookall [Cro61-78],   in more systematic fashion, did much the same thing. Many of the people who   report OBEs have found the notion of astral projection helpful, and describe   their experiences in these terms.

  There are several serious problems with the   theory of astral projection, as pointed out by Susan Blackmore [Bla82]. The   first is that many OBEs simply do not fit well into the astral projection   framework. Celia Green [Gre68a] has collected many cases in which the person   describes no astral body, indeed no other body at all. Also very few people   actually report any cord, let alone the traditional silver cord.

  Of course this type of experience can be   fitted in by saying that the experient's astral vision was clouded, or the   astral body or cord too fine to be seen, but these methods of attempting to   account for actual experience begin to weaken the theory. Blackmore criticizes   the complexity of the theory of astral projection as it tries to account for new   facts. And this relates to the second problem, its 'stretch-ability.' In her   opinion the theory is so complicated and flexible that almost anything can be   stretched to fit it and it makes hard to draw definite predictions from the   theory. If you don't see the features you should, your astral vision is not   clear enough, or memory was not passed on from higher levels. If you fail to   make yourself visible to someone else then not enough etheric matter was   involved and so on. In this way the 'theory' is in danger of explaining   everything and nothing. Furthermore, any theory which is untestable is useless   in scientific terms.

  What is   animism?

  A school of thought has grown up within   parapsychology, and around its fringes, which takes very seriously the idea of   death being an OBE in which one did not succeed in getting back into one's body.   Gauld [Gau82] refers to this school of thought as the 'animistic' school (anima   = soul), 'animism' being the view that every human mind, whether in its before   death or after death state 'is essentially and inseparably bound up with some   kind of extended quasi-physical vehicle, which is not normally perceptible to   the senses of human beings in their present life' [Bro62]. An argument which one   commonly hears from members of the animistic school runs as follows; OBEs and   near-death experiences are, so far as we can tell, universal. They have been   reported from many different parts of the world and in many different historical   eras. The experiences of the persons concerned therefore must reflect genuine   features of the human constitution; for we cannot possibly suppose that they   derive from a common stream of religious tradition or folk-belief-- the   societies from which they have been reported are too widely separated in space   and time for the common-origin idea to be a serious possibility.

  The most powerful shot in the the animist's   locker remains, however, still to be mentioned. There are some cases -- by no   means a negligible number in which a person who is undergoing an OBE, and finds   himself at or 'projects' himself to a particular spot distant from his physical   body, has been seen at that very spot by some person present there. Such cases   are generally known as 'reciprocal' cases. Thus the animist, starting from his   study of OBEs and NDEs, claims to have direct evidence that after death we   remain the conscious individuals that we always have been and that the 'vehicle'   of our surviving memories and other psychological dispositions is a surrogate   body whose properties (other perhaps than that of being malleable by thought)   are, he would admit, largely unknown.

  In addition to taking OBEs and NDEs as   themselves evidence for survival, the animist might well feel able to offer the   following argument in support of regarding a further class of phenomena as   evidence for survival of consciousness following physical death. There is in the   literature on apparitions a substantial sprinkling of cases of apparitions of   deceased persons, some of which have been seen by witnesses who did not know the   deceased in life. An extensive statistical investigation by the late professor   Hornell Hart [Har56] strongly suggests that apparitions of the dead and the   phantasms of living 'projectors' in reciprocal cases are, as classes,   indistinguishable from each other in what may be called their 'external   characteristics' -- such as whether the figure was solid, dressed in ordinary   clothes, seen by more than one person, whether it spoke, adjusted itself to its   physical surroundings, etc. Now we know that in reciprocal cases the phantasms   of the projector is in some sense a center of or a vehicle of consciousness,   namely the consciousness of the projector. Since apparitions of the dead and of   living projectors manifestly belong to the same class of objects or events, we   may properly infer that since the apparitions of living projectors are vehicles   for the consciousness of the person in question, this must be true of   apparitions of the dead also. Hence the consciousness of deceased persons   survives and may either have, or make use of, a kind of body.

    Can the OBEer be seen as an   apparition?

  The study of apparitions formed an important   part of early physical research, and many different types of apparition have   been recorded, but the ones which primarily interest us here are those in which   a person having an OBE simultaneously appeared to someone else as an apparition.   There are many cases of this kind in the early literature and they have been   quoted again and again but a relatively small number of them really form the   mainstay of the anecdotal evidence on OBE apparitions. Crookall [Cro61] and   Smith [Smi65] give some recent cases but they too concentrate on the older ones.   Green [Gre68a] discusses the similarities between apparitions in general and the   asomatic body perceived by OBEers, but she does not give any examples from her   own case collection in which another person saw the exteriorized double. By   contrast, about 10% of Palmer's OBEers claimed to have been seen as an   apparition [Pal79b] and Osis claims that from his survey OBEers 'frequently'   said they were noticed by others and in 16 cases (6% of the total) he was able   to obtain some verification through witnesses, although he does not expand on   this remark. Obviously it would be very helpful if much more evidence of this   sort could be collected, and recent cases thoroughly checked.

    How can one find out what an   OBE is like?

  One of the easiest ways to find out what OBE   is like is to collect a large number of accounts of cases and compare them. In   this way any common features can be extricated and variations noted. A great   deal can be learned about the conditions under which the experiences occurred,   how long they lasted, and what they were like. Accounts by people who have had   OBEs fall, roughly speaking, into two categories. There are the many ordinary   people to whom an OBE occurs just once, or a few times; and there is a small   number of people who claim to be able to project at will.

  The limitations of this method are that there   are many important questions which cannot be answered by collecting cases. Since   the people voluntarily report their experiences, the sample necessarily ends up   with a bias. Many accounts are given many years or even decades after the event   and it is then impossible to determine how much of the story has altered in   memory with the passage of time. For such reasons it is not possible to   determine, for example, how common the the experience actually is. Second, many   OBEers claim that they were able to see rooms into which they had never been,   describe accurately people they had never met, or move physical objects during   their experience. Such reports are of great interest to parapsychology but they   cannot be tested by collecting cases.

    What is an average astral   projection like?

  Accounts of OBEs have been collected since   the beginning of psychical research. The first collection of cases of   spontaneous apparitions, telepathy, and clairvoyance published in 1886 as   'Phantasms of the Living [GMF86]. Frederic Myers also collected similar cases   for his 'Human Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death' [Mye03].

  The first major collection was made by   Muldoon and Carrington and published in 1951 [MC51]. Nearly a hundred accounts   were categorized according to whether they were produced by drugs or   anesthetics, occurred at the time of accident, death or illness, or were set off   by suppressed desire. Finally they gave cases in which spirits seemed to be   involved. By categorizing the cases in this way, Muldoon and Carrington were   able to compare and interpret them in the light of their theories of astral   projection, but they did not go beyond this rather simple analysis. These   researchers implied that we do have a double, and that it is capable of   perceiving at a distance and even of surviving without the physical body.

  The largest collections of accounts of astral   projection have been amassed by Robert Crookall. In his many books [Cro61, 64a]   he has presented hundreds of cases which show the kinds of consistencies as   Muldoon and Carrington found. He also divided the cases according to how they   were brought about. First there were the 'natural' ones which included those   people who nearly died or were very ill or exhausted, as well as those who were   quite well. Contrasted with these were the 'enforced' cases, being induced by   anesthetics, suffocation and falling, or deliberately by hypnosis.

  Typical features of Crookall's accounts were   the mysterious light illuminating the darkness, the white double, the ability to   travel at will and inability to affect material objects. Crookall cited typical   elements of the natural projection being the cord joining the two bodies,   feelings of peace and happiness and the clarity of mind and realness' of   everything seen. By contrast with what Crookall calls 'the enforced' OBE, by   which he means one which is entered into deliberately by the experient, he   argued the person typically finds himself not in happy and bright surroundings   but in a dream or conditions reminiscent of popular conceptions of 'Hades.'

  In projection two aspects can be   exteriorized: in natural OBEs the soul body or the astral body is ejected free   of the vehicle of vitality and the vision of the experient is clear, but when   the OBE is the result of a conscious effort to have an OBE some of the lower   vehicle is shed at the same time and clouds the vision. The same principles   apply in death: natural deaths according to NDE accounts usually lead to an   experience of paradisiacal conditions, but the victim of an 'enforced' death is   likely to find himself in Hades with clouded vision and consciousness.

  The implication of Crookall's argument is   that there is an astral body, a vehicle of vitality and a silver cord, and that   we survive death to live on a higher plane. He believed that insofar as such a   thing could be proved, the many cases he had collected proved the existence of   our other bodies.

    What is an average OBE like?

  The previous case collections were made by   researchers who believed implicitly in the astral projection interpretation of   the OBE. A properly analyzed case collection can provide a rich source of   information about what the OBE is like, The collections used here include those   by Hart, Green, Poynton and Blackmore and the analysis is made by Blackmore   [Bla82].

  Hornell Hart, a professor of sociology at   Duke University in North Carolina, collected together cases of what he called   'ESP projection' [Har54]. He required that the person not only have an OBE, but   also acquire veridical information, as though from the OB location. This   excludes many OBEs in which the information gained was wrong or could not be   checked. He also rated the cases. The best possible case would gain a score of   1.0, but in fact the highest score given was .90. No higher scores were gained   because the cases show a curious mixture of correct and incorrect vision which   seems to be common in the OBE.

  Through this research, one assumption is   crucial, that ESP projection is a single phenomenon which might have any or all   of Hart's eight features. Rogo [Rog78b] and Tart [Tar74a] have both suggested   that several different types of experience may have been lumped together under   the label 'OBE.' It could be that astral projection, traveling clairvoyance, and   apparitions are quite different and need different interpretations, or other   distinctions might be more relevant. The reason Hart gave why the non-evidential   cases should be excluded is far from satisfactory: if there was no evidence of   ESP they did not count in his analysis. Hart was ruling out the majority of   cases on the basis of a very shaky criterion.

  Perhaps the most thorough, and certainly the   best-known case collection was carried out by Celia Green of the institute of   Psychophysical Research [Gre68a]. Her definition of an OBE was an experience,   defined as follows, '... one in which the objects of perception are apparently   organized in such a way that the observer seems to himself to be observing them   from a point of view which is not coincident with his physical body.' J. C.   Poynton [Poy75] like Green, advertised in the press, and circulated a   questionnaire privately, and on the whole Poynton's results, although less   detailed, are similar to Green's. Susan Blackmore [Bla82] has analyzed the cases   collected by the SPR and by herself

  Apparently most people have had only one OBE,   but the frequency of subjects claiming many OBEs is high enough to conclude that   if a person has had one OBE he or she is more likely to have another. Also many   people learn to control their OBEs to some extent, even if they never learn to   induce them reliably at will.

  OBEs are occurring in a variety of   situations. Green found that 12% of single cases occurred during sleep, 32% when   unconscious, and 25% were associated with some kind of psychological stress,   such as fear, worry, or overwork. Some cases show that it is possible to have an   OBE while the body continues with complex and co activity. However, OBEs are far   more common when the physical body is relaxed and inactive.

  Most of Green's cases occurred to people   whose physical body was lying down at the time (75%). A further 1 8% were   sitting and the rest were walking, standing or were 'indeterminate.' In fact it   seemed that muscular relaxation was an essential part of many people's   experience. Just a few found that their body was paralyzed. A feeling of   paralysis was found to be only rarely a prelude to an OBE.

  A difference is found between the 'single'   cases and the multiple cases. The latter tended to have had experiences in   childhood, and learned to repeat them. The single cases tended to occur mostly   between the ages of 15 and 35. Poynton found that many more of his cases came   from females, but among the SPR cases there are more males than females. This   sort of difference is most likely to be due to sample differences.

  Floating and soaring sensations are certainly   common. Poynton also found that most of his OBEers saw or felt their physical   body. On the contrary, catalepsy rarely occurred. Some subjects mentioned noises   or a momentary blacking out, but this did not seem to be the rule. The majority   just 'found themselves' in the ecsomatic state. As for the return, for most it   was as sudden as the departure. An interesting finding by Green was that more of   the subjects who had had many OBEs went through complex processes on separation   and return.

  Green separated her cases into those she   called 'parasomatic,' involving another body, and those she termed 'asomatic' in   which there was no other body. Her surprising finding was that 80% of cases were   asomatic -- they had no other body. She asked her subjects whether they had felt   any connection between themselves and their physical bodies. Under a third said   they had, and only 3.5% reported a visible or substantial connection such as a   cord. Poynton's results tell a similar story. There seems to be little evidence   from the case collections to support the usual details of astral projection.

  Green found that on the whole perceptual   realism was preserved. Subjects saw their own bodies and the rooms they traveled   in as realistic and solid. Even when the scene appears to be perfectly normal   there may be slight differences. Some her subjects said that everything looked   and felt exaggerated. The experience is typically in only one or two modalities:   vision and hearing. Green found that 93% of single cases included vision, a   third also had hearing, but the other senses were rarely noted. Another   interesting feature of the OBE world is its lighting. In some mysterious way the   surroundings become lit up with no obvious source of light visible, or else   objects seem to glow with a light of their own.

  Perhaps the most important question about the   OBE is whether people can see things they did not know about -- in other words   whether they can use ESP in the course of an OBE. Among Green's subjects, some   felt as though they could have seen anything, but lacked the motivation to test   out such an ability. Another related question is whether subjects in an OBE can   affect objects, or have the power of psychokinesis. On the whole the evidence is   against that possibility.

  The last feature which Celia Green found to   be common in OBEs is that a spontaneous OBE can have a profound effect on the   person who experiences it. Sometimes OBEs can be very frightening, sometimes   exciting and sometimes they provide a sense of adventure. Interestingly, Green   found that fear was more common in later, not initial experiences. Pleasant   emotions are also common.

  How   common are OBEs?

  Two surveys have used properly balanced   samples drawn from specified populations. The first was conducted by Palmer and   Dennis [PD75, Pal79b]. They chose the inhabitants of Charlottesville, Virginia,   a town of some 35,000 people and selected 1,000 of these as their sample. The   question on OBEs was worded as follows: 'Have you ever had an experience in   which you felt that 'you' were located 'outside of' or 'away from' your physical   body; that is the feeling that your consciousness, mind, or center of awareness   was at a different place than your physical body? (if in doubt, please answer   'no'.)' To this 25% of students and 14% of the townspeople said 'yes.'

  Further data from this survey reveals that no   relationship between age and reported OBEs was found. Palmer found a significant   positive relationship between drug use and OBEs and concluded that this could   account for the higher prevalence of OBEs in students. This relationship   receives confirmation from work by Tart [Tar71]. In a survey of 150 marijuana   users he found that 44% claimed to have OBEs. It seems possible that the use of   this drug facilitate OBEs.

  The second survey using a properly   constructed sample was carried out by Erlendur Haraldsson, an Icelandic   researcher, and his colleagues [HGRLJ76] For the survey a questionnaire was sent   to a random sample of 1157 persons between ages of 30 and 70 years. There were   53 questions on various psychic and psi-related experiences including a   translation of Palmer's question. To this, only 8% of the Icelanders replied   yes.

  Those vague statements about OBEs being   'common' are now backed up by a variety of figures. Biackmore gives a personal   estimate of the incidence of OBEs, based on all the available evidence putting   it at around 10%. She thinks we can say with more conviction that the OBE is a   fairly common experience.

  The surveys show that if a person has had one   OBE he or she is more likely to have another. All these figures are far higher   than you would expect if OBEs were distributed at random in the population.

  Green went on to compare different groups to   see whether they had had different numbers of OBEs. Her only finding was that   OBEers were more likely to report experiences which they thought could only be   attributed to ESP. Palmer and Kohr found that subjects who reported one type of   'psychic' or 'psi-related' experience also tended to report others.

  Palmer also, like Green, found that many   simple variables were irrelevant. Sex, age, race, birth order, political views,   religion, religiosity, education, occupation and income were all unrelated to   OBEs.

  Palmer found significant relationships   between OBEs and practicing meditation, mystical experiences and, as we have   already seen, drug experiences. Palmer had over 100 people reporting one or more   OBEs, and asked them various questions about the experience. They were asked   whether they had seen their physical body from 'outside' and this was reported   for 44% of the experiences and by nearly 60% of the OBEers, Fewer than 20% of   experiences involved 'traveling and fewer than 30% of OBEers reported it. Still   fewer reported that they had acquired information by ESP while 'out-   of-the-body,' about 14% of people and 5% of experiences, or had appeared as an   apparition to someone else (less than 10% or OBEers). These results confirm the   findings of the case collections: that few OBEs include all the features of a   classical astral projection.

  Overall the OBE seemed to have had a highly   beneficial effect on its experiencers. Many claimed their fear of death was   reduced, and their mental health and social relationships improved. Ninety- five   percent said they would like to have another OBE.

    What are the   prerequisites for inducing an OBE?

  Many of the inducing methods use as a   starting point techniques designed to improve the novice's powers of relaxation,   imagery, and concentration. The ideal state appears to be one of physical   relaxation, or even catalepsy, combined with mental alertness.&nbsp; BEFORE YOU   ATTEMPT TO INDUCE ANY TYPE OF ALTERED STATE - MAKE SURE YOU CHECK WITH YOUR   DOCTOR TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE IN NO PHYSICAL OR MENTAL DANGER IF YOU DO SO.

  One of the easiest ways to relax is to use   progressive muscular relaxation. In outline this technique consists of starting   with the muscles of the feet and ankles and alternately tensing and relaxing   them, then going on up the muscles of the calves and thighs, the torso, arms,   neck and face, until all the muscles have been contracted and relaxed. Done   carefully this procedure leads to fairly deep relaxation within a few minutes,   and with practice it becomes easier.

  Relaxation usually leads to state of   paralysis or catalepsy. When you go to sleep, your brain deactivates the   mechanism by which you are able to use your limbs, so that you become incapable   of physical activity corresponding to your dream images when you dream. Quite a   few people have found themselves in this paralysis state as soon as they have   gotten up after sleeping.

  The first type of paralysis, known as 'type   A,' is a condition encountered when approaching a deeper layer of consciousness   from a light trance state. The second, 'type B' paralysis, is the reverse of   type A, in that it happens during the return home to physical reality. The first   type A 'paralysis' goes something like this:  'Mmmmmm.... I know 1 am awake; I can   	think Mmrnmmrnm but my body is asleep ...&quot; (Robert Monroe labeled it Focus   	10 consciousness)

  	'Wait a minute here, there is something   	going on here, I just can't seem to....

  	'Yes, I can't seem to move my limbs; they   	seemed to be laden with lead, why can't I move at all? Hey, what's happening   	here! (Panic! )&quot;

  A typical type B 'paralysis' goes something   like this:  'Mmmmm... I am feeling groggy,   	absolutely. What was that just now, oh, it must be some dream...'

  	'Mmmm hang on a minute, was that a noise   	I heard? It must have come from the door... I need to check it out, could be   	a burglar but I am so tired... and sleepy...'

  	'I need to wake up, it could be   	important.... Hey, I can't seem to wake up, why are my legs not waking up,   	why can't my hands respond?'

  	'PANIC!!! E need to wake up!!! I don't   	want to die... I need to exert more will on this Hey, body, wake up, eyes   	open, ... WAKE UP!'

  	'Gosh, NOW, I can move my limbs, I am   	awake now, body covered with perspiration, sitting at the edge of the bed,   	wondering why just now I simply couldn't wake up...

  	'Phew - Thank goodness, it is finally   	over. Am I glad to be back to the familiar physical environment.'

  However, type A paralysis is the type that   should not be resisted; if the person can allow himself to 'go with the flow,'   then some kind of altered state of consciousness is bound to happen, which is   what the person is hoping to achieve anyway.

  Many astral travelers have stressed the   importance of clear imagery or visualization for inducing OBEs and of course   imagery training forms an important part of magical development. Progressive   methods of imagery training are often described in magical and occult books, and   helpful guidance can be found in Conway's occult primer [Con72] and in Brennan's   'Astral doorways' [Bre71]. Most involve starting with regular practice at   visualizing simple geometrical shapes and then progressing to harder tasks such   as imagining complex three-dimensional forms, whole rooms and open scenery.

  Practice 1:   Read the description slowly and then try to imagine each stage as you go along:   Imagine an orange. it is resting on a blue plate and you want to eat it. You dig   your nail into the peel and tear some of it away. You keep pulling on the peel   until all of it, and most of the pith, is lying in a heap on the plate. Now   separate the orange into segments, lay them on the plate as well, and then eat   one.

  If this task doesn't make your mouth water,   and if you cannot feel the juice which squirts from the orange, and smell its   tang then you do not have vivid or trained imagery. Try it again, the colors   should be bright and vivid and the shapes and forms clear and stable. With   practice at this and similar tasks your imagery will improve until you may   wonder how it could ever have been so poor.

  Practice 2:   This is a rather harder one: Visualize a   disc, half white and half black. Next imagine it spinning about its center,   speeding up and then slowing down, and stopping. Next imagine the same disc in   red, but as it spins it changes through orange, yellow, green, blue and violet.   Finally you may care to try two discs side by side spinning in opposite   directions and changing color in opposition too.

  Other useful skills are concentration and   control. Not only do you need to be able to produce vivid imagery, but also to   abolish all imagery from your mind, to hold images as long as you want and to   change them as you want, both quickly and slowly.

  Practice 3:   Brennan suggests trying to count, and only to count. The instant another thought   comes to mind you must stop and go back to the beginning. If you get to about   four or five you are doing well, but you are almost certain to be stopped by   such thoughts as 'this is easy, I've got to three already,' or '1 wonder how   long I have to go on.'

  All these skills, relaxation, imagery and   concentration, are suggested again and again as necessary for inducing an OBE at   will. Other aids include posture. If you lie down you might fall asleep,   although Muldoon [ advocates this position. On the other hand discomfort will   undoubtedly interfere with the attempt. Therefore an alert, but comfortable   posture is best. Some have suggested that it is best not to eat for some hours   before and to avoid any stress, irritation or negative emotions.

  How   to induce an OBE?

  Imagery   Techniques

  It is possible to use imagery alone but it   requires considerable skill.

  a) Lie on your back in a comfortable position   and relax. Imagine that you are floating up off the bed. Hold that position,   slightly lifted, for some time until you lose all sensation of touching the bed   or floor. Once this state is achieved move slowly into an upright position and   begin to travel away from your body and around the room. Pay attention to the   objects and details of the room. Only when you have gained some proficiency   should you try to turn round and look at your own body. Note that each stage may   take months of practice and it can be too difficult for any but a practiced   OBEer.

  b) In any comfortable position close your   eyes and imagine that there is a duplicate of yourself standing in front of you.   You will find that it is very hard to imagine your own face, so it is easier to   imagine this double with its back to you. You should try to observe all the   details of its posture, dress (if any) and so on. As this imaginary double   becomes more and more solid and realistic you may experience some uncertainty   about your physical position. You can encourage this feeling by contemplating   the question Where am I?', or even other similar questions 'Who am IT and so on.   Once the double is clear and stable and you are relaxed, transfer your   consciousness into it. You should then be able to 'project in this phantom   created by your own imagination. Again, each stage may take long practice.

    Inducing a Special   Motivation to Leave the Body

  You can trick yourself into leaving your body   according to Muldoon and Carrington [MC29]. They suggested that if the   subconscious desires something strongly enough it will try to provoke the body   into moving to get it, but if the physical body is immobilized, for example in   sleep, then the astral body may move instead. Many motivations might be used but   Muldoon advised against using the desire for sexual activity which is   distracting, or the harmful wish for revenge or hurt to anyone. Instead he   advocated using the simple and natural desire for water - thirst, This has the   advantages this it is quick to induce, and it must be appeased.

  In order to employ this technique, you must   refrain from drinking for some hours before going to bed. During the day   increase your thirst by every means you can. Have a glass of water by you and   stare into it, imagining drinking, but not allowing yourself to do so. Then   before you retire to bed. eat 'about an eighth of a teaspoonful' of salt. Place   the glass of water at some convenient place away from your bed and rehearse in   your all the actions necessary to getting it, getting up, crossing the room,   reaching out for it, and so on. You must then go to bed, still thinking about   your thirst and the means of satisfying it. The body must become incapacitated   and so you should relax, with slow breathing and heart rate and then try to   sleep. With any luck the suggestions you have made to yourself will bring about   the desired OBE. This is not one of the most pleasant or effective methods.

  Ophiel's   'Little System'

  Ophiel [Oph61] suggests that you pick a   familiar route, perhaps between two rooms in your house, and memorize every   detail of it. Choose at least six points along it and spend several minutes each   day looking at each one and memorizing it. Symbols, scents and sounds associated   with the points can reinforce the image. Once you have committed the route and   all the points to memory you should lie down and relax while you attempt to   'project' to the first point. If the preliminary work has been done well you   should be able to move from point to point and back again. Later you can start   the imaginary journey from the chair or bed where your body is, and you can then   either observe yourself doing the movements, or transfer your consciousness to   the one that is doing the moving. Ophiel describes further possibilities, but   essentially if you have mastered the route fully in your imagination you will be   able to project along it and with practice to extend the projection.

  Ophiel states that starting to move into OBE   will produce strange sounds. He says that this is because the sense of hearing   is not carried over onto the higher planes, and that means that your mind tries   to recreate sonic input, and just gets subconscious static. He asserts that the   noises can take any form, including voices, malevolent, eerie, and get worse and   worse, more and more disturbing, until eventually they peak and then just fade   to a constant background hiss while one has OBE, Apparently, his 'final noise'   sounded like his water heater blowing up. He says, anyway, to ignore the noises,   voice or otherwise, as they are only static or subconscious rambling, and do not   represent any being in any way, not even the self really.

  The   Christos Technique

  G. M. Glasking, an Australian journalist,   popularized this technique in several books, starting with Windows of the Mind   [Gla74] Three people are needed: one as subject, and two to prepare him. The   subject lies down comfortably on his back in a warm and darkened room. One   helper massages the subject's feet and ankles, quite firmly, even roughly, while   the other take his head. Placing the soft part of his clenched fist on the   subject's forehead he rubs it vigorously for several minutes. This should make   the subject's head buzz and hum, and soon he should begin to feel slightly   disorientated. His feet tingle and his body may feel light or floaty, or   changing shape.

  When this stage is reached, the imagery   exercises begin. The subject is asked to imagine his feet stretching out and   becoming longer by just an inch or so. When he says he can do this he has to let   them go back to normal and do the same with his head, stretching it out beyond   its normal position. Then, alternating all the time between head and feet, the   distance is gradually increased until he can stretch both out to two feet or   more. Al this stage it should be possible for him to imagine stretching out both   at once, making him very long indeed, and then to swell up, filling the room   like a huge balloon. All this will, of course, be easier for some people than   others. it should be taken at whatever pace is needed until each stage is   successful. Some people complete this part in five minutes, some people take   more than fifteen minutes.

  Next he is asked to imagine he is outside his   own front door. He should describe everything he can see in detail, with the   colors, materials of the door and walls, the ground, and the surrounding   scenery. He has then to rise above the house until he can see across the   surrounding countryside or city. To show him that the scene is all under his   control he should be asked to change it from day to night and back again,   watching the sun set and rise, and the lights go on or off. Finally he is asked   to fly off, and land wherever he wishes. For most subjects their imagery has   become so vivid by this stage that they land somewhere totally convincing and   are easily able to describe all that they see.

  You may wonder how the experience comes to an   end, but usually no prompting is required; the subject will suddenly announce Tm   here,' or 'Oh, I'm back,' and he will usually retain quite a clear recollection   of all he said and experienced. But it is a good idea to take a few minutes   relaxing and getting back to normal. It is interesting that this technique seems   to be very effective in disrupting the subject's normal image of his body. It   then guides and strengthens his own imagery while keeping his body calm and   relaxed.

  Robert   Monroe's Method

  In his book 'Journeys Out of the Body'   [Mon71] Monroe describes a complicated- sounding technique for inducing OBEs. In   part it is similar to other imagination methods, but it starts with induction of   the 'vibrational state.' Many spontaneous OBEs start with a feeling of shaking   or vibrating, and Monroe deliberately induces this state first. He suggests you   do the following. First lie down in a darkened room in any comfortable position,   but with your head pointing to magnetic north. Loosen clothing and remove any   jewelry or metal objects, but he sure to stay warm. Ensure that you will not be   disturbed and are not under any limitation of time. Begin by relaxing and then   repeat to yourself five times, 'I will consciously perceive and remember all   that I encounter during this relaxation procedure. I will recall in detail when   I am completely awake only those matters which will be beneficial to my physical   and mental being.' Then begin breathing through your half mouth.

  The next step involves entering the state   bordering sleep (the hypnagogic state). Monroe does not recommend any particular   method of achieving this state. One method you might try is to hold your forearm   up, while keeping your upper arm on the bed, or ground. As you start to fall   asleep, your arm will fall, and you will awaken again. With practice you can   learn to control the hypnagogic state without using your arm. Another method is   to concentrate on an object. When other images start to enter your thoughts, you   have entered the hypnagogic state. Passively watch these images. This will also   help you maintain this state of near-sleep. Monroe calls this Condition A.

  After first achieving this state Monroe   recommends to deepen it. Begin to clear your mind and observe your field of   vision through your closed eyes. Do nothing more for a while. Simply look   through your closed eyelids at the blackness in front of you. After a while, you   may notice light patterns. These are simply neural discharges and they have no   specific effect. ignore them. When they cease, one has entered what Monroe calls   Condition B. From here, one must enter an even deeper state of relaxation which   Monroe calls Condition C -- a state of such relaxation that you lose all   awareness of the body and sensory stimulation. You are almost in a void in which   your only source of stimulation will be your own thoughts. The ideal state for   leaving your body is Condition D. This is Condition C when it is voluntarily   induced from a rested and refreshed condition and is not the effect of normal   fatigue. To achieve Condition D, Monroe suggests that you practice entering it   in the morning or after a short nap.

  With eyes closed look into the blackness at a   spot about a foot from your forehead, concentrating your consciousness on that   point. Move it gradually to three feet away, then six, and then turn it 90   degrees upward, reaching above your head. Monroe orders you to reach for the   vibrations at that spot and then mentally pull them into your head. He explains   how to recognize them when they occur. 'It is as if a surging, hissing,   rhythmically pulsating wave of fiery sparks comes roaring into your head. From   there it seems to sweep throughout your body, making it rigid and immobile.'   This method is easier than it sounds.

  Once you have achieved the vibrational state   you have to learn to control it, to smooth out the vibrations by 'pulsing' them.   At this point, Monroe warns it is impossible to turn back. He suggests reaching   out an arm to grasp some object which you know is out of normal reach. Feel the   object and then let your hand pass through it, before bringing it back, stopping   the vibrations and checking the details and location of the object. This   exercise will prepare you for full separation.

  To leave the body Monroe advocates the   'lift-out' method. To employ this method think of getting lighter and of how   nice it would be to float upwards. An alternative is the 'rotation' technique in   which you turn over in bed, twisting first the top of the body, head and   shoulders until you turn right over and float upwards. Later you can explore   further. With sufficient practice Monroe claims that a wide variety of   experiences are yours for the taking.

  Ritual Magic   Methods

  Most magical methods are also based on   imagery or visualization and use concentration and relaxation. All these methods   require good mental control and a sound knowledge of the system being used, with   its tools and symbols, Charles Tart, in introducing the concept of 'state   specific sciences' [Tar72b] also considered state specific technologies, that   is, means of achieving, controlling and using altered states of consciousness.   Many magical rituals are really just such technologies. In a typical exercise   the magician will perform an opening ritual, a cleansing or purifying ritual and   then one to pass from one state to another. Once in the state required he   operates using the rules of that state and then returns, closes the door that   was opened and ends the ritual.

  This technology varies almost as much as the   theory, for there are a multitude of ways of reaching the astral. One can use   elemental doorways, treat the cards of the tarot as stepping stones, perform   cabbalistic path- workings or use mantras. The techniques are very similar to   all others we have been considering, so we can see the complexities of ritual   magic as just another related way achieving the same ends.

    Meditation and Chakra Meditation

  Meditation has two basic functions -   achieving relaxation and improving concentration. Therefore the ideal state for   OBE is familiar to meditators and indeed OBEs have occasionally been reported   during meditation and yoga. The two main types of meditation are concentration   meditation (focusing) and insight meditation (mindfulness). Most kinds of   meditation are the concentrative type. One simply focuses his attention upon a   single physical object, such as a candle flame; upon a sensation, such as that   felt while walking or breathing; upon an emotion, such as reverence or love;   upon a mantra spoken aloud or even silently; or upon a visualization as in   chakra meditation. Concentration meditation is, simply put, a form of   self-hypnosis.

  The other main type of meditation, insight   meditation, is the analysis of thoughts and feelings in such a way as to cause   realization of the subjectivity and illusion of experience. Such meditation is   done in an effort to attain transcendental awareness.

  Chakra meditation is a special type of   concentrative meditation which is basically kundalini yoga the practice of   causing psychic energy (kundalini) to flow up sushumna, energizing the various   chakras along the way. A chakra is 'a sense organ of the ethereal body, visible   only to a clairvoyant' [Gay74]. As each chakra is energized by this practice, it   is believed to add occult powers (sidhis), until at last the crown chakra is   reached, and with it, full enlightenment is attained.

  According to East Indian philosophy, man   possesses seven major chakras or psychic centers on his body. In theosophical   scheme there are ten chakras, which permit those trained in their use to gain   knowledge of the astral world (three of the ten are used in black magic only).   Each of the chakras forms a bridge, link, or energy transformer; changing pure   (higher) energy into various forms, and connecting different bodies together.   The chakras are located along the nadies (a network of psychic nerves or   channels) and follow the autonomic nervous system along the spinal cord.

  The first chakra, located at the base of the   spine at the perineum is the root chakra, muladhara. The second chakra, known as   the sacral center, svadhisthana, is located above and behind the genitals. Third   of the chakras is the solar plexus, manipura, located at the navel and it is   said to correspond with the emotions and also with psychic sight (clairvoyance).   The heart chakra, anahata, is the fourth chakra, located over the heart and   corresponding with the psychic touch, The fifth chakra is the throat chakra,   vishuddha, located at the base of the throat (thyroid) and corresponding with   psychic hearing (clairaudience).

  The remaining two chakras are believed to   relate mostly to elevated states of consciousness. The frontal chakra, (or   'third eye') ajna, the sixth chakra, is located between, and slightly above, the   eyebrows. Ajna is the center of psychic powers and it is believed to be able to   produce many psychic effects. Finally, the crown chakra, sahasrara, located atop   the head, (pineal gland) is the seventh chakra. It is referred to as the   thousand-petal lotus and corresponds with astral projection and enlightenment.

  To practice this chakra meditation, you   simply concentrate on the chakras, beginning with the root chakra, and moving   progressively up, as you visualize psychic energy from the root chakra traveling   up shushumna and vivifying each higher chakra. As mentioned above the chakras   have certain properties associated with them, so that this type of visualization   may 'raise consciousness,' promote astral projection, and other things - once   you have reached ajna and eventually the crown chakra.

  Hypnosis

  In the early days of psychical research   hypnosis was used a great deal more than now to bring about 'traveling   clairvoyance,' but it can still be used. All that is required is skilled   hypnotist with some understanding of the state into which he wants to put the   subject, and a willing subject. The subject must be put into a fairly deep   hypnotic state and then the hypnotist can suggest to him that he leaves his   body. The subject can be asked to lift up out of his body, to create a double   and step into it, to roll off his bed or chair, or leave through the top of his   head. He can then be asked to travel to any place desired, but hypnotist must be   sure to specify very clearly where he is to go, and to bring him safely back to   his body when expedition is over. If this is not done the subject may have   difficulty reorienting himself afterwards.

  Drugs - THIS SECTION FOR   SCHOLARLY RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY, NOT A METHOD RECOMMENDED OR ENDORSED

  There are some drugs which can undoubtedly   help initiate an OBE. Hallucinogens have long been used in various cultures to   induce states like OBEs, and in our own culture OBEs are sometimes an accidental   product of a drug experience. In absence of any further information we might   already be able to guess -which are the sorts of drugs likely to have this   effect. They might be those which physically relax the subject while leaving his   consciousness clear and alert, Drugs which distort sensory input and disrupt the   subject's sense of where and what shape his body is ought to help, and so may   anything which induces a sense of shaking or vibration. Imagery must be   intensified without control being lost and finally there must be some reason, or   wish, for leaving the body.

  Considering these points hallucinogens might   be expected to be more effective than stimulants, tranquillizers or sedatives.   The latter may aid relaxation but help with none of the other features just   mentioned. Few other types of drug have any relevant effect. This fact fits with   what is known about the effectiveness of drugs for inducing OBEs. Monroe states   that barbiturates and alcohol are harmful to the ability, and this makes sense   since they would tend to reduce control over imagery even though they are   relaxing. Eastman [Eas62] states that barbiturates do not lead OBEs whereas   morphine, ether, chloroform, major hallucinogens and hashish can.

  Relatively little research has carried out in   this area, partly because most of the relevant drugs are illegal in the   countries where that research might be carried out. It seems that certain drugs   can facilitate an OBE but what is not clear is why drug experience should take   that form rather than any other. Part of the answer is that usually it does not.   There is no specific OBE-creating drug, and OBEs are relatively rarely a part of   a psychedelic drug experience. Drugs may help in inducing the OBE but they are   not recommended as a route to the instant projection, they are no alternative to   learning the skills of relaxation, concentration, and imagery control.

  Dream   Development

  Many OBEs start from dreams and since, by   definition, one has to be conscious to have an OBE, they tend to start from   lucid dreams. The dreamer may become aware that he is dreaming and then find   himself in some place other than his bed and able to move about at will. He may   have another body and may even attempt to see his physical body lying asleep.   This topic is covered separately in the later section on lucid dreams.

    Palmer's Experimental Method

  In the search for a simple and effective   method of inducing an OBE Palmer and his colleagues [PL75a, 75b, 76, PV74a, 74b]   use relaxation and audio- visual stimulation. Subjects went through a   progressive muscular relaxation session and the heard oscillating tones and   watched a rotating spiral. One of the interesting findings was that many of the   subjects claimed that they had been 'literally out of their bodies, and there   were indications that their experiences were very different in some ways from   other those encountered in OBEs.

    What are lucid dreams?

  The term lucid dreaming refers to dreaming   while knowing that you are dreaming. It was coined by the Dutch psychiatrist   Frederik van Eeden in 1913, it is something of a misnomer since it means   something quite different from just clear or vivid dreaming. Nevertheless we are   certainly stuck with it. That lucid dreams are different from ordinary dreams is   obvious as soon as you have one. The experience is something like waking up in   your dreams. It is as though you !come to! and find you are dreaming. This   experience generally happens when you realize during the course of a dream that   you are dreaming, perhaps because something weird occurs. Most people who   remember their dreams have had such an experience at some time, often waking up   immediately after the realization. however, it is possible to continue in the   dream while remaining fully aware that you are dreaming.

  One distinct and confusing form of lucid   dreams are false awakenings. You dream of waking up but in fact, of course, are   still asleep. Van Eeden [Van13] called these 'wrong waking up' and described   them as 'demoniacal uncanny, and very vivid and bright, with ... a strong   diabolical light.' The one positive benefit of false awakenings is that they can   sometimes be used to induce OBEs. Indeed, Oliver Fox [Fox62] recommends using   false awakenings as a method for achieving the OBE. For many people OBEs and   lucid dreams are practically indistinguishable. If you dream of leaving your   body, the experience is much the same.

  LaBerge's studies of physiology of the   initiation of lucidity in the dream state have revealed that lucid dreams have   two ways of starting. In the much more common variety, the 'dream-initiated   lucid dream' (DILD), the dreamer acquires awareness of being in a dream while   fully involved in it. DILDs occur when dreamers are right in the middle of REM   sleep, showing lots of the characteristic rapid eye movements, DILDs account for   about four out of every five lucid dreams that the dreamers have had in the   laboratory. In the other 20 percent, the dreamers report awakening from a dream   and then returning to the dream state with unbroken awareness one moment they   are aware that they are awake in bed in the sleep laboratory, and the next   moment, they are aware that they have entered a dream and are no longer   perceiving the room around them. These are called 'wake initiated lucid dreams'   (WILDs).

  For many people, having lucid dreams is fun,   and they want to learn how to have more or to how to induce them at will. One   finding from early experimental work was that high levels of physical (and   emotional) activity during the day tend to precede lucidity at night. Waking   during the night and carrying out some kind of activity before falling asleep   again can also encourage a lucid dream during the next REM period and is the   basis of some induction techniques. Many methods have been developed and they   roughly fall into three categories.

  One of the best known techniques for   stimulating lucid dreams is LaBerge's MILD (Mnemonic Induction of Lucid   Dreaming). This technique is practiced on waking in the early morning from a   dream. You should wake up fully, engage in some activity like reading or walking   about, and then lie down to go to sleep again. Then you must imagine yourself   asleep and dreaming, rehearse the dream from which you woke, and remind   yourself, 'Next time I have this dream, I want to remember I'm dreaming.'

  A second approach involves constantly   reminding yourself to become lucid throughout the day rather than the night.   This is based on the idea that we spend most of our time in a kind of waking   daze. If we could be more lucid in waking life, perhaps we could be more lucid   while dreaming. German psychologist Paul Tholey [Tho83] suggests asking yourself   many times every day, 'Am I dreaming or not?' This exercise might sound easy,   but is not. It takes a lot of determination and persistence not to forget all   about it. For those who do forget, French researcher Clerc suggests writing a   large 'C' on your hand (for 'conscious') to remind you [GB89]. This kind of   method is similar to the age-old technique for increasing awareness by   meditation and mindfulness.

  The third and final approach requires a   variety of gadgets. The idea is to use some sort of external signal to remind   people, while they are actually in REM sleep, that they are dreaming. Hearne   first tried spraying water onto sleepers' faces or hands but found it too   unreliable. This sometimes caused them to incorporate water imagery into their   dreams, but they rarely became lucid. He eventually decided to use a mild   electrical shock to the wrist. His 'dream machine' detects changes in breathing   rate (which accompany the onset of REM) and then automatically delivers a shock   to the wrist [Hea9O].

  Meanwhile, in California, LaBerge [LaB85] was   rejecting taped voices and vibrations and working instead with flashing lights.   The original version of a lucid dream-inducing device which he developed was   laboratory based and used a personal computer to detect the eye movements of REM   sleep and to turn on flashing lights whenever the REMs reached a certain level.   Eventually, however, all the circuitry was incorporated into a pair of goggles.   The idea is to put the goggles on at night, and the lights will flash only when   you are asleep and dreaming. The user can even control the level of eye   movements at which the lights begin to flash. The newest version has a chip   incorporated into the goggles, which will not only control the lights but will   store data on eye-movement density during the night as well as information about   when and for how long the lights were flashing, making fine tuning possible.

  There are two reasons for associating lucid   dreams with OBEs. First, recent research suggests that the same people tend to   have both lucid dreams and OBEs [Bla88, Irw88]. Second, as Green pointed out   [Gre68b] it is hard to know where to draw the line between an OBE and a lucid   dream. In both, the person seems to be perceiving a consistent world. Also the   subject, unlike in an ordinary dream, is well aware that he is in some altered   state and is able to comment on and even control the experience. Green refers to   all such states as 'metachoric experiences.' It is possible to draw a line   between these two experiences, but the important point to realize is that that   line is not clear, and the two have much in common.

  But there is an important difference between   lucid dreams and the other states. In the lucid dream one has insight into the   state (in fact that fact defines the state). In false awakening, one does not   have such insight (again by definition). In typical OBEs, people feel that they   have really left their bodies. Those experiencing NDEs may have a sense of   rushing down a long tunnel, which some perceive as being an entryway into a   world beyond death. It is only in the lucid dream that one realizes it is a   dream.

  Just as in the case of OBEs, surveys can tell   us how common lucid dreams are and who has them. Blackmore estimates that about   50 percent of people have had at least one lucid dream in their lives [Bla91].   Green [Gre66] found that 73% of student sample answered 'yes' to the question,   'Have you ever had a dream in which you were aware that you were dreaming?.'   Palmer found that 56% of the townspeople and 71% of the students in his sample   reported that they had had lucid dreams and many of these claimed to have them   regularly [Pal79b]. Blackmore found that 79% of the Surrey students she   interviewed had them [Bla82]. Beyond producing these kinds of results, it does   not seem that surveys can find out much. There are no very consistent   differences between lucid dreamers and others in terms of age, sex, education,   and so on [ All these surveys seem to agree quite closely, showing that the   lucid dream is a rather common experience far more common than the OBE.

    What is the   physiology of dreams and lucid dreams?

  The electrical activity of the brain has been   observed and classified with EEG (electroencephalograph) equipment; signals are   picked up from the scalp by electrodes, then filtered and amplified to drive a   graph recorder. Brain activity has been found to produce specific ranges for   certain basic states of consciousness, as indicated in 'Hz' (Hertz, or   cycles/vibrations per second):

  delta 0.2 to 3.5 Hz (deep sleep, trance   state) theta 3.5 to 7.5 Hz (day dreaming, memory) alpha 7.5 to 13 Hz   (tranquility, heightened awareness, meditation) beta -- 13 to 28 Hz (tension,   'normal' consciousness)

  In the drowsy state before failing asleep,   the EEG is characterized by many alpha waves while the muscles start to relax.   Gradually this state gives way to Stage 1 sleep. Three more stages follow, each   having different BEG patterns and marked by successively deeper states of   relaxation. By Stage 4 the sleeper is very relaxed, his breathing is slower, and   skin resistance high. He is very hard to wake up. If the dreamer is awakened, he   may say that he was thinking about something or he may describe some vague   imagery, but he will rarely recount anything which sounds like a typical dream.

  But this is not all there is to sleep   increasing oblivion. In a normal night's sleep, a distinct change takes place an   hour or two after the onset of sleep. Although the muscles are still relaxed,   the sleeper may move, and from the EEG it appears that he is going to wake up   and he returns to something resembling Stage 1 sleep. Yet he will still be very   hard to wake up, and in this sense is fast asleep. The most distinctive feature,   however, is the rapid eye movements, or REMs and the stage is also called   REM-sleep. in earlier stages the eyes may roll about slowly, now, however, they   dart about as though watching something, If woken up now the sleeper will   usually report that he was dreaming.

  Lucid dreams implied that there could be   consciousness during sleep, a claim many psychologists denied for more than 50   years. Orthodox sleep researchers argued that lucid dreams could not possibly be   real dreams. If the accounts were valid, then the experiences must have occurred   during brief moments of wakefulness or in the transition between waking and   sleeping, not in the kind of deep sleep in which REMs and ordinary dreams   usually occur. In other words, they could not really be dreams at all.

  This contention presented a challenge to   lucid dreamers who wanted to convince people that they really were awake in   their dreams. But of course when you are deep asleep and dreaming you cannot   shout, 'Hey! Listen to me. I'm dreaming right now.' During REM sleep, the   muscles of the body, excluding the eye muscles and those responsible for   circulation and respiration, are immobilized by orders from a nerve center in   the lower brain. This fact prevents us from acting out our dreams. Occasionally,   this paralysis turns on or remains active while the person's mind is fully awake   and aware of the world.

  It was Keith Hearne [Hea78] of the University   of Hull, who first exploited the fact that not all the muscles are paralyzed. in   REM sleep the eyes move. So perhaps a lucid dreamer could signal by moving the   eyes in a predetermined pattern. Lucid dreamer Alan Worsley first managed to do   this in Hearne's laboratory. He decided to move his eyes left and right eight   times in succession whenever he became lucid. Using a polygraph, Hearne could   watch the eye movements for sign of the special signal. The answer was   unambiguous. AU the lucid dreams occurred in definite REM sleep. In other words   they were, in this sense, true dreams.

  A typical lucid dream lasted between two and   five minutes, occurred at about 6.30 am., about 24 minutes into a REM period and   towards the end of a 22 REM burst. The nights on which lucid dreams occurred did   not show a different sleep pattern from other nights, although they did tend to   follow days of above average stimulation.

  It is sometimes said that discoveries in   science happen when the time is right for then. It was one of those odd things   that at just the same time, but unbeknownst to Hearne, Stephen LaBerge, at   Stanford University in California, was trying the same experiment. He too   succeeded, but resistance to the idea was very strong. In 1980, both Science and   Nature rejected his first paper on the discovery [LaB85]. It was only later that   it became clear just how important this discovery had been.

  Some conclusions can be drawn from this   information, In both OBEs and lucid dreams, the person seems to have his waking   consciousness, or something close to it. He is able to see clearly, but what he   sees is not quite like the physical and it appears to have many of the   properties of a dream world or imaginary world. But there are differences as   well: the lucid dream starts more often when the subject is asleep, and the   dream world is less distinct and real than the OB 'world, allowing less control   and freedom of movement; in addition, the person who has an OBE starting from   the waking state never actually thinks he is dreaming. Most lucid dreams involve   only the subject, but there are cases on record of 'meetings' in lucid dreams.   The important question is whether the OBEer is observing the same world as the   lucid dreamer. Are the two experiences essentially aspects of the same   phenomenon?

  According to Stephen LaBerge it seems   possible that at least some OBEs arise from the same conditions as sleep   paralysis, and that these two terms may actually be naming two aspects of the   same phenomenon [LL91]. In his opinion the survey evidence favors this theory.   There is also considerable evidence that people who tend to have OBEs also tend   to have lucid dreams, flying and falling dreams, and the ability to control   their dreams [Bla84, Gli89, Irw88]. Because of the strong connection between   OBEs and lucid dreaming, some researchers in the area have suggested that OBEs   are a type of lucid dream [Far76, Hon79, Sal82].

  One problem with this argument is that   although people who have OBEs are also likely to have lucid dreams, OBEs are far   less frequent, and can happen to people who have never had lucid dreams.   Furthermore, OBEs are quite plainly different from lucid dreams in that during a   typical OBE the experient is convinced that the OBE is a real event happening in   the physical world and not a dream, unlike a lucid dream, in which by definition   the dreamer is certain that the event is a dream. There is an exception that   connects the two experiences -- when we feel ourselves leaving the body, but   also know that we are dreaming.

  LaBerge organized a study which consisted of   analysis of the data of 107 lucid dreams from a total of 14 different people.   The physiological information that was collected included brain waves, eye-   movements and chin muscle activity. In all cases, the dreamer signaled the   beginning of the lucid dream by making a distinct pattern of eye movements.   After verifying that all the lucid dreams had eye signals showing that they had   happened in REM sleep, they were classified into DILDs and WILDs, based on how   long the dreamers had been in REM sleep without awakening before becoming lucid,   and on their report of either having realized they were dreaming while involved   in a dream (DILD) or having entered the dream directly from waking while   retaining lucidity (WILD).

  Alongside the physiological analysis each   dream report was scored for the presence of various events that are typical of   OBEs, such as feelings of body distortion (including paralysis and vibrations),   floating or flying, references to being aware of being in bed, being asleep or   lying down, and the sensation of leaving the body.

  Ten of the 107 lucid dreams qualified as OBEs,   because the dreamers reported feeling as if they had left their bodies in the   dream. Twenty of the lucid dreams were WILDs, and 87 were D1LDs. Five of the   OBEs were WILDs (28%) and five were DILDs (6%). Thus, OBEs were more than four   times more likely in WILDs than in DILDs. The three OBE-related events which   were looked for also all occurred more often in WILDs than in DILDs. Almost one   third of WILDs contained body distortions, and over a half of them included   floating or flying or awareness of being in bed. This is in comparison to DILDs,   of which less than one fifth involved body distortions, only one third included   floating or flying, and one fifth contained awareness of bed.

  The reports from the five DILDs that were   classified as OBEs were actually much like those from the WILD-OBEs. In both the   dreamers felt themselves lying in bed and experiencing strange sensations   including paralysis and floating out-of-body. Although these lucid dreams sound   like WILDs, they were classified as D1LDs because the physiological records   showed no awakenings preceding lucidity. However, it is possible that these   people could have momentarily become aware of their environments (and hence been   'awake') while continuing to show the brainwaves normally associated with REM   sleep.

  The laboratory studies show that when OBEs   happen in lucid dreams they happen either when a person re-enters REM sleep   right after an awakening, or right after having become aware of being in bed.   Could this relationship apply to OBEs and lucid dreams that people experience at   home, in the 'real world'?

  Not being able to take the sleep lab to the   homes of hundreds of people LaBerge conducted a survey about OBEs and other   dream-related experiences. The difference between his survey and previous ones   is that in addition to asking if people had had OBEs, he asked specifically   about certain events that are known to be associated with WILDs, namely, lucid   dreaming, returning directly to a dream after awakening from it, and sleep   paralysis.

  A total of 572 people filled out the   questionnaire. About a third of the group reported having had at least one OBE.   Just over 80 percent had had lucid dreams. Sleep paralysis was reported by 37   percent and 85 percent had been able to return to a dream after awakening.   People who reported more dream-related experiences also reported more OBEs. For   example, of the 452 people claiming to have had lucid dreams, 39 percent also   reported OBEs, whereas only 15 percent of those who did not claim lucid dreams   said they had had OBEs. The group with the most people reporting OBEs (51 %)   were those who said they had experienced lucid dreams, dream return, and sleep   paralysis.

  In this survey, people reporting frequent   dream return also tended to report frequent lucid dreams. Thus, LaBerge believes   that the fact that dream return frequency is linked with OBE frequency in this   study gives further support to the laboratory research finding that WILDs were   associated with OBEs. On the other hand he stresses that the proof that some or   even most OBEs are dreams is not enough to allow us to say that a genuine OBE is   impossible. However, he suggests that if you have an OBE, why not test to see if   the OBE-world passes the reality test. Is the room you are in the one you are   actually sleeping in? if you have left your body, where is it? Do things change   when you are not looking at them (or when you are)? Can you read something twice   and have it remain the same on both readings? LaBerge asks 'If any of your   questions and investigations leave you doubting that you are in the physical   world, is it not logical to believe you are dreaming?' [LL91].

    What is the physiology of OBEs?

  Clearly there are similarities between OBEs   and dreams. In both we experience a world in which imagination plays a great   part and we can perform feats not possible in everyday life. But the OBE differs   in many important and obvious ways from what we have called an ordinary dream.   For a start, it usually occurs when the subject is awake, or at least if drowsy   or drugged, not sleeping. Second, the imagery and activities of an OBE are   usually much less bizarre and more coherent than those of an ordinary dream, and   most often the scenery is something from the normal environment rather than the   peculiar setting of dreams. Third, OBEers are often adamant that their   experience was nothing like a dream. Finally, there is the great difference in   the state of consciousness. Ordinary dreams are characterized by very cloudy in   consciousness at best, and are only recognized as dreams on waking up.

  But these differences are not enough. You may   argue that in a lucid dream both the imagery and the state of consciousness are   much more like those in an OBE. So perhaps the OBE is a kind of lucid dream   occurring in the midst of waking life. One way to find out might be to determine   the physiological state in which the OBE takes place. Such a finding can only be   made by means of laboratory experiment; but first we need to catch an OBE in the   laboratory.

  Observing an OBE in the laboratory setting is   not easy. Most people who have an OBE have only one, or at most few, in a   lifetime, Capturing an OBE requires a special kind of subject, one who is both   able to induce an OBE at will, and willing to be subjected to the stress of   being tested. Fortunately there are such subjects.

  One of the first to be tested was a young   girl called Miss Z., by Charles Tart who studied her OBEs [Tar68].&nbsp; Her   OBEs all occurred at night. She used to wake up in the night and find herself   floating near the ceiling. With Miss Z. as subject Tart initially wanted to test   two aspects of the OBE: first, whether ESP could occur during an OBE, and second   what physiological state was associated with the experience. Altogether, Miss Z.   spent four non nights sleeping at the lab.

  During her first night Miss Z. had no OBEs.   During the second night she woke twice and reported that she had been floating   above her body. During the first experience Miss Z. had not yet fallen asleep   when the OBE occurred, and the BEG showed a drowsy waking pattern followed by   waking when she told Tart about the experience. All the time the heart rate had   been steady and there were no REMs. Then at 3.15 am. Miss Z. woke up and called   out 'write down 3.13.' Apparently she had left her body and lifted up high   enough to see the clock on the wall. At that time the EEG showed various   patterns but predominantly theta and alphoid activity. There were few sleep   spindles (a feature of the EEG pattern in certain stages of sleep), no REMs, no   GSRs (galvanic skin response) and a steady heartbeat.

  On the third night Miss Z. had a dramatic   OBE. She seemed to be flying, and found herself at her home in Southern   California, with her sister. Her sister got up from the rocking chair where she   had been sitting and the two of them communicated without speaking. After a   while they both walked into the bedroom and saw the sister's body lying in bed   asleep. Almost as soon as she realized that it was time to go, the OBE was over   and Miss Z. found herself back in the laboratory. Tart was not able to contact   the sister to check whether she had been aware of the visit, but the   physiological record showed that there was mostly alphoid activity with no REMs   and only a couple of minutes of Stage 1., dreaming sleep, with REMs.

  The last night was in some ways the most   exciting, for on that occasion the subject was able to see an ESP target   provided; but the EEG record was obscured by a lot of interference. Tart   described it as somewhat like Stage 1 with REMs, but he added that he could not   be sure whether it was a Stage 1 or a waking pattern.

  Amongst all these confusing and changeable   patterns, some certainty does emerge. In general the EEG showed a pattern most   like poorly developed Stage 1 mixed with brief periods of wakefulness.&nbsp; For   this subject at least OBEs do not occur in the same state as dreaming. Tart   would have liked to have continued working with Miss Z. but this proved   impossible as she had to return to Southern California.

  However, Tart [Tar67] was able to work with   another subject, Robert Monroe, well known from his books. Monroe was monitored   for nine sessions with EEG and other devices, in this environment Monroe had   difficulty inducing an OBE. Electrodes were clipped to his ear, and he found   them very uncomfortable. During all the time that he was trying to have an OBE   his EEG showed a strange mixture of patterns. There was unusually varied alpha   rhythm, variable sleep spindles, and high voltage theta waves. On the whole Tart   concluded that Monroe was in Stages I and 2 and was relaxed and drowsy, falling   in and out of sleep. His sleep pattern was quite normal and he had normal dream   periods and sleep cycle.

  During the penultimate session Monroe managed   to have an OBE. Tart concluded that Monroe's OBEs occurred in the dreaming   state; but this idea presented him with a problem. Monroe claims that for him,   dreaming and OBEs are entirely different. Tart finally concluded that perhaps   the OBEs were a mixture of dreams and 'something else.' This 'something else'   might, he thought, be ESP.

  One of the next subjects to be tested in this   way was Ingo Swann. In several experiments at the ASPR [OM77] Swann was attached   to the EEG equipment while he sat in a darkened room and tried to exteriorize,   in his own time, and to travel to a distant room where ESP targets were set up.   He did not fall asleep and was thus able to make comments about how he was   getting on. After some months of this type of experiment Swann suggested that he   might be able to leave his body on command and so he was arranged to receive an   audible signal to tell him when to go, and when to return. Apparently he   succeeded in this effort, which meant that OBE and other times could easily be   determined and compared.

  During the OBE periods, the EEG was markedly   flattened and there were frequency changes, with a decrease in alpha and   increase in beta activity. While these changes took place, the heart rate stayed   normal. These findings are rather different from those with previous subjects in   that Swann seemed to be more alert during his OBEs. Perhaps this just confirms   what was learned from case studies, that the OBE can occur in a variety of   states. But perhaps most important is that in no case so far did there seem to   be a discrete state in which the OBE took place. There were no sudden changes in   either EEG or autonomic functions to mark the beginning or end of the OBE. Any   changes were gradual; unlike dreaming, the OBE does not seem to be associated   with a discrete physiological state.

  The one other subject who has taken part in a   large number of OBE experiments is Keith ('Blue') Harary. The experiments in   which his physiological state was measured were carried out at the Physical   Research Foundation [Mor73, HJH74, JHHLM74, MHJHR78]. The findings were   different again from those of previous studies. Here there were no changes in   EEG. The amount and frequency of alpha were the same in OBE and 'cool down'   periods and there were only slightly fewer eye movements in the OBE phases.   These measurements alone show that Harary was awake and that his OBEs did not   occur in a sleeping, dreaming or borderline state.

  Other measures did show a change. Skin   potential fell, indicating greater relaxation, and it was this measure which   provided the best indicator that an OBE had begun. Both heart rate and   respiration increased. These changes are surprising because they imply a greater   degree of arousal; the opposite of the finding from skin potential, So in some   ways Harary was more relaxed, but he was also more alert.

  Great differences between subjects tend to   obscure any clear pattern in the states, but in all this confusion it is clear   that the start of an OBE does not coincide with any abrupt physiological change.   There is no discrete OBE state. The OBE does not, at least for these subjects,   and under these conditions, occur in a state resembling dreaming. The subjects   were relaxed, and even drowsy or lightly asleep, but they were not dreaming when   they had their OBEs,

    What   are near-death experiences and are they some kind of OBEs?

  Much publicity has recently been given to   research on near-death experiences (NDEs), experiences of those who survive a   close encounter with death. More people now survive close brushes with death.   The near-death experience has been defined as the 'experiential counterpart of   the physiological transition to biological death' [Sab82]: it is the record of   conscious experience from the inside rather than the outside, from the point of   view of the subject rather the spectator.

  Raymond Moody [Moo75, 77] interviewed many   people who had been resuscitated after having had accidents and he then put   together an idealized version of a typical near-death experience. He emphasized   that no one person described the whole of this experience, but each feature was   found in many of the stories. Here is his description:  A man is dying and, as he reaches the   	point of greatest physical distress, he hears himself pronounced dead by his   	doctor. He begins to hear an uncomfortable noise, a loud ringing or buzzing,   	and at the same time feels himself moving very rapidly through a long dark   	tunnel. After this, he suddenly finds himself outside of his own physical   	body, but still in the immediate physical environment, and he sees his own   	body from a distance, as though he is a spectator. He watches the   	resuscitation attempt from this unusual vantage point and is in a state of   	emotional upheaval.

  	After a while, he collects himself and   	becomes more accustomed to his odd condition. He notices that he still has a   	'body,' but one of a very different nature and with very different powers   	from the physical body he has left behind. Soon other things begin to   	happen. Others come to meet and to help him, He glimpses the spirits of   	relatives and friends who have already died, and a loving, warm spirit of a   	kind he has never encountered before -- a being of light -- appears before   	him. This being asks him a question, non-verbally, to make him evaluate his   	life and helps him along by showing him a panoramic, instantaneous playback   	of the major events of his life. At some point he finds himself approaching   	some sort of barrier or border, apparently representing the limit between   	earthly life and the next life. Yet, he finds that he must go back to the   	earth, that the time for his death has not yet come. At this point he   	resists, for by now he is taken up with his experiences in the afterlife and   	does not want to return. He is overwhelmed by intense feelings of joy, love,   	and peace. Despite his attitude, though, he somehow reunites with his   	physical body and lives.

  	Later he tries to tell others, but he has   	trouble doing so. In the first place, he can find no human words adequate to   	describe these unearthly episodes. He also finds that others scoff, so he   	stops telling other people. Still, the experience affects his life   	profoundly especially his views about death and its relationship to life.

  The parallel between this kind of account and   many OBEs is clear. There is the tunnel traveled through as well as the   experiences of seeing one's own body from outside and seeming to have some other   kind of body, and the ineffability is familiar. One is tempted to conclude that   in death a typical OBE, or astral projection, occurs, and is followed by a   transition to another world, with the aid of people who have already made the   crossing, and that of higher beings in whose plane one is going to lead the next   phase of existence. Although Moody's work gave a good idea of what dying could   be like for some people, it did not begin to answer questions such as how common   this type of experience is.

  After Moody there have been studies by   cardiologists Rawlings and Sabom. The most detailed research has been carried   out by Kenneth Ring, a psychologist from Connecticut Rin79, 80], From hospitals   there he obtained the names of people who had come close to death, or who had   been resuscitated from clinical death. Almost half of his sample (4 8%) reported   experiences which were, at least in part, similar to Moody's description. Of   Ring's subjects, 95 per cent of those asked stated that the experience was not   like a dream (the same result appears in Sabom): they stressed that it was too   real, being more vivid and more realistic; however some aspects were hard to   express, as the experience did not resemble anything that had happened to them   before.

  One of Ring's most interesting findings   concerned the stages of the experience. He showed that the earlier stages also   tended to be reported more frequently. The first stage, peace, was experienced   by 60% of his sample, some of whom did not reach any further stages. The next   stage, of most interest to us here, was that of body separation,' in other   words, the OBE. Thirty per cent of Ring's sample reached this stage and what   they reported sounds very similar to descriptions of OBEs. Not all the 'body   separations' were distinct. Many of Ring's respondents simply described a   feeling of being separate or detached from everything that was happening.

  Ring tried to find out about two specific   aspects of these OBEs. First he asked whether they had another body. The answer   seemed to be 'no': most were unaware of any other body an answered that they   were something like 'mind only.' There was a similar lack of descriptions of the   'silver cord.' We can see that an OBE of sorts forms an important stage in the   near experience.

  After the OBE stage comes 'entering the   darkness' experienced by nearly a quarter of Ring's subjects. It was described   as 'a journey into a black vastness without shape or dimension,' as 'a void, a   nothing' and as 'very peaceful blackness.'

  For fifteen per cent the next stage was   reached, 'seeing the light.' The light was sometimes at the end of the tunnel,   sometimes glimpsed in the distance but usually it was golden and bright without   hurting the eyes. Sometimes the light was associated with a presence of some   kind, or a voice telling the person to go back.

  Finally there were ten per cent experiencers   who seemed to 'enter the light and pass into or just glimpse another world. This   was described as a world of great beauty, with glorious colors, with meadows of   golden grass, birds singing, or beautiful music. It was at this stage that   people were greeted by deceased relatives, and it was from this world that they   did not want to come back.

  A completely different kind of analysis was   applied by Noyes and Kletti [Noy72, NK76] to accounts collected from victims of   falls, drowning, accidents, serious illnesses, and other life-threatening   situations. They emphasized such features as altered time perception and   attention, feelings of unreality and loss of emotions, and the sense of   detachment. They found that these features occurred more often in people who   thought they were about to die than in those who did not. This fitted their   interpretation of the experiences as a form of depersonalization (i.e., the loss   of the sense of personal identity or the sensation of being without material   existence) in the face of a threat to life; that is as a way of escaping or   becoming dissociated from the imminent death of the physical body.

  Two other aspects have yet to be dealt with.   First, there is the absence of any trips to 'hell.' Neither Moody nor Ring   obtained any accounts of hellish experiences. However, cardiologist Maurice   Rawlings [Raw78] has suggested that the reason for there being no such reports   is that although patients may recall such hellish experiences immediately   afterwards, they tend to forget them with time. In other words, their memories   protect them from recalling the unpleasant aspects. According to Rawlings it is   only because they have been interviewed too long after the brush with death that   all the experiences are reported as pleasant. It does seem to be the 'good' side   of experiences which makes the greater impact.

  Another feature which needs mention is the   'life review.' It has often been found that a person close to death may seem to   see scenes of his past life pass before him as though on a screen, or in   pictures. Ring found that about a quarter of his core-experiencers reported a   life review, and that it was more common in accident victims than others.

  The general effects of undergoing an NDE are   of two kinds: philosophical and ethical. The main philosophical changes are in   attitudes towards death and afterlife. Sabom's figures are extremely interesting   in this respect: he asked those who had and those had not had an NDE when   unconscious whether there was any change in their views of death and the   afterlife. Of the 45 who had not had any conscious experience, 39 were just as   afraid of death as before, 5 more afraid and 1 less afraid; while of the 61 with   an NDE none were more afraid, 11 just as afraid and 50 less afraid. The patterns   were similar concerning belief in an afterlife: of the non- experiencers, none   had any change of attitude; while of the experiencers, 14 found their attitude   unchanged and 47 stated that their belief in the afterlife had increased   [Sab82]. Ring found a correlation between loss of fear of death and what he   called the core experience, broadly that with a positive transcendental element   in it. Moody comments that there is remarkable agreement about the 'lessons'   brought back from NDEs: 'Almost everyone has stressed the importance in this   life of trying to cultivate love for others, a love of a unique and profound   kind' [Moo75]. And he adds that a second characteristic is a realization of the   importance of seeking knowledge, of not confining one's horizon to the material.

  A number of reductionist physiological   explanations have been advanced to account for NDEs: the two most common are   'cerebral anoxia' and 'depersonalization'. Cerebral anoxia accounts for the   experience by saying that it is a hallucination due to an oxygen shortage in the   brain. We have seen that such 'hallucinations' frequently turn out to correspond   to the physical events actually occurring -- can the NDE therefore be labeled a   hallucination? Perhaps it can, but certainly not as a delusion. Ring and Moody   both point out that patterns of experiences are no different when there is   clearly no shortage of oxygen. Noyes starts by pointing out that none of the   subjects can really have been dead if they were resuscitated, so that their   reported experiences cannot be taken as 'proof of survival of consciousness.   Moody never actually states such a position, but rather confines himself to   asserting that the experiences have a suggestive value; even if for the subjects   themselves the experience is proof.

  The common factor underlying all the   physiological explanations of the NDE is the attempt to avoid the prima facie   interpretation of the experience as an OBE. Sabom concludes that this hypothesis   is the best fit with the data, while Ring concludes that 'there is abundant   empirical evidence pointing to the reality of out-of-body experiences; that such   experiences conform to the descriptions given by our near-death experiencers;   and that there is highly suggestive evidence that death involves the separation   of a second body a double from the physical body' [Rin80].

  Just as many different interpretations have   been presented for all aspects of the near-death experience. The most important   of them have been usefully summarized by Grosso [Gro81]. Most people seem to   agree that the near-death experience presents remarkable consistency varying   little across differences in culture, religion, and cause of the crisis; what is   in dispute is why there should be such a consistency. Rawlings steeps all his   findings in the language of Christianity, involving heaven and hell and the   possibility of being saved. Noyes interprets NDEs in terms of depersonalization;   Siegel in terms of hallucinations, and Ring, within a parapsychological   holographic model. But broadly speaking there are two camps. On the other side   are those who see the near-death experience as a sure signpost towards another   world and a life after death; on the other, those who have, in various different   ways, interpreted the experience as part of life, not death, and as telling us   nothing whatsoever about a 'life after life.'

    Is the OBE some kind of mental   illness?

  If the OBE is to be seen as involving   psychological processes, rather than paranormal ones, we need to look at what   those processes could be. Let us begin with a psychiatric approach and ask   whether the OBE, or anything like it, is found in any mental illness.

  Noyes and Kletti likened near-death   experiences to the phenomenon of depersonalization. Related to depersonalization   is de-realization, in which the surroundings and environment begin to seem   unreal and the sufferer seems to be cut off from reality. Depersonalization is   the more common of the two, and involves feelings that the person's own body is   foreign or does not belong. He may complain that he does not feel emotions even   though he appears to express them, and he may suffer anxiety, distortions of   time and place, and changes in his body image, and the subject may seem to   observe things from a few feet ahead of his body. His conscious 'I-ness' is said   to be outside his body. The patients characterize their imagery as pale and   colorless, and some complain that they have altogether lost the power of   imagination.

  This description does not sound like that of   someone who has had an OBE or a NDE. There are distortions of the environment   and alterations in imagery in OBE and NDE experiences, but it seems that imagery   typically becomes more bright and vivid, colorful and detailed, rather than pale   and colorless. There are changes in the emotions -- but rather than a perishing   of love and hate, many OBEers report deep love and joy and positive emotions.   The phenomena of de-realization and depersonalization do not in the least help   us to understand. Any small similarities are outweighed by overwhelming   differences.

  One syndrome specifically involving doubles   is the unusual 'Capgras syndrome.' A person suffering from this illusion may   believe that a friend or relative has been replaced by an exact double. Since   this double is like the real person in every discernible way, nothing that the   'real person' says or does will convince the patient otherwise. In this way the   patient can avoid the guilt he feels at any malicious or negative feelings   towards a loved one. From even this very brief description it is obvious that   this illusion bears no resemblance to the OBE.

  More relevant may be the kinds of double seen   in autoscopy, literally 'seeing oneself.' Although the OBE is rarely   distinguished from autoscopy in the psychiatric literature, other distinctions   are made instead, The main distinction is that OBE involves feeling of being   outside the body while autoscopy usually consist of seeing a double. Some people   see the whole of their body as a double; some see only parts, perhaps only the   face. There is an internal form in which the subject can see his internal   organs; and a cenesthetic form in which he does not see, but only feels the   presence of his double. There is even a negative form in which the subject   cannot see himself even when he tries to look into a mirror.

  An entirely different way of looking at   autoscopy is through the physical problems with which it is sometimes   associated. One of these is migraine, the most obvious symptom of which is the   debilitating headache. During, before or after the pain some migraine suffers   apparently experience autoscopy. In any case, a number of examples of people who   have suffered both migraine and a simultaneous experience of either autoscopy or   an OBE, does not prove any particular kind of connection between the two.

      Are people who have greater imagery skills more likely to have OBEs?

  OBEs might be expected to be more frequently   experienced by people with the most highly developed skills of conceiving mental   images if the experience is one constructed entirely from the imagination. Irwin   [Irb80, 81b] was interested in whether OBEers differ from other people in terms   of certain cognitive skills or ways of thinking, including imagery. He found 21   OBEers and to these he gave the 'Ways of thinking questionnaire' (WOT), the   'Differential personality questionnaire' (DPQ) and the 'Vividness of visual   imagery questionnaire' (VVIQ). For each he compared the scores of the OBEers   with those expected from studies of larger groups of the population.

  The imagery questionnaire a self-rated   measure of vividness of just visual imagery. The scores of these few OBEers were   unexpectedly found to be lower than normal, and significantly so.&nbsp; It seems   that they had less, not more, vivid imagery than the average. The next test, the   WOT, aims to test the verbalizer-visualizer dimension of cognitive style.   Irwin's OBEers obtained scores no different from the average. So there was no   evidence that OBEers are either specially likely to use visualization or   verbalization.

  Although not directly relevant to the subject   of imagery, the results of the DPQ were interesting. One of the various   dimensions of cognitive style which it measures is 'Absorption.' This relates to   a person's capacity to become absorbed in his experience. For example, someone   who easily becomes immersed in nature, art or a good book or film or a computer   game, to the exclusion of the outside world, would be one who scored highly on   the scale of 'Absorption.' Irwin expected OBEers to be higher on this measure   and that is what he found. His OBEers seemed to be better than average at   becoming involved in their experiences.

    Are OBEs some kind of   hallucination?

  There is no single accepted definition of   hallucinations and it is not clear just how they relate to sensory perception,   illusion, dreams and imagination. However, let us define an hallucination as an   apparent perception of something not physically present, and add that it is not   necessary for the hallucination to be thought 'real to count. Into this category   come a wide range of experiences occurring in people, not suffering from any   mental or psychiatric disturbance. Visual imagery may occur just before going to   sleep (hypnagogic), on first waking up (hypnopompic) or they may be induced by   drugs, sensory deprivation, sleeplessness, or severe stress. They may take many   forms, from simple shapes to complex scenes.

  Although it is possible to have an   hallucination involving almost any kind of imagery, it has long been known that   there are remarkable similarities between the hallucinations of different   people, under different circumstances. Hallucinations were first classified   during the last century during a period when many artists and writers   experimented with hashish and opium as an aid to experiencing them. in 1926   Kluver began a series of investigations into the effects of mescaline and   described four constant types. These were first the grating, lattice or   chessboard, second the cobweb type, third the tunnel, cone or vessel, and fourth   the spiral. As well as being constant features of mescaline intoxication in   different people, Kluver found that these forms appeared in hallucinations   induced by a wide variety of conditions.

  In the 1960s, when many psychedelic drugs   began to be extensively used for recreational purposes, research into their   effects proliferated. Leary and others tried to develop methods by which   intoxicated subjects could describe what was happening to them. Eventually Leary   and Lindsley developed the 'experiental typewriter' with twenty keys   representing different subjective states. Subjects were trained to use it but   the relatively high doses of drugs used interfered with their ability to press   the keys and so a better method was needed.

  A decade later Siegel gave subjects   marijuana, or THC, and asked them simply to report on what they saw. Even with   untrained subjects he found remarkable consistencies in the hallucinations, in   the early stages simple geometric forms predominated. There was often a bright   light in the center of the field of vision which obscured central details but   allowed images at the edges to be seen more clearly, and the location of this   light created a tunnel-like perspective. Often the images seemed to pulsate and   moved towards or away from the light in the center of the tunnel. At a later   stage, the geometric forms were replaced by complex imagery including   recognizable scenes with people and objects, sometimes with snail animals or   caricatures of people. Even in this stage there was much consistency, with   images from memory playing a large part.

  On the basis of this work Siegel constructed   a list of eight forms, eight colors, and eight patterns of movement, and trained   subjects to use them when given a variety of drugs (or a placebo) in controlled   environment. With amphetamines and barbiturates the forms reported were mostly   black and white forms moving aimlessly about, but with THC, psilocybin, LSD and   mescaline the forms became more organized as the experience progressed. After 30   minutes there were more lattice and tunnel forms, and the colors shifted from   blue to red, orange to yellow. Movement became more organized with explosive and   rotational patterns. After 90 - 120 minutes most forms were lattice tunnels;   after that complex imagery began to appear with childhood memories and scenes,   emotional memories and some fantastic scenes. But even these scenes often   appeared in a lattice-tunnel framework. At the peak of the hallucinatory   experience, subjects sometimes said that they had become part of the imagery.   They stopped using similes and spoke of the images as real.&nbsp; Highly   creative images were reported and the changes were very rapid. According to   Siegel [Sie77] at this stage, 'The subjects reported feeling dissociated from   their bodies.'

  The parallels between the drug-induced   hallucinations and the typical spontaneous OBE should be obvious. Not only did   some of the subjects in Siegel's experiments actually report OBEs, but there   were the familiar tunnels and the bright lights so often associated with   near-death experiences. There was also the 'realness' of everything seen; and   the same drugs which elicited the hallucinations are those which are supposed to   be conducive to OBEs.

  There have been many suggestions as to why   the tunnel form should be so common. It has sometimes been compared to the   phenomenon of 'tunnel vision' in which the visual field is greatly narrowed, but   usually in OBEs and hallucinations the apparent visual field is very wide; it is   just formed like a tunnel. A more plausible alternative depends on the way in   which retinal space is mapped on cortical space. If a straight line in the   visual cortex of the brain represents a circular pattern on the retina then   stimulation in a straight line occurring in states of cortical excitation could   produce a sensation of concentric rings, or a tunnel form. This type of argument   is important in understanding the visual illusions of migraine, in which   excitations spread across parts of the cortex.

  Another reasonable speculation is that the   tunnel has something to do with constancy mechanisms. As objects move about, or   we move relative to them, their projection on the retina changes shape and size.   We have constancy mechanisms which compensate for this effect. For very large   objects, distortions are necessarily a result of perspective, and yet we see   buildings as having straight wall and roofs. If this mechanism acted   inappropriately on internally generated spontaneous signals, it might produce a   tunnel-like perspective, and any hallucinatory forms would also be seen against   this distorted background.

  In drug-induced hallucinations there may come   a point at which the subject becomes part of the imagery and it seems quite real   to him, even though it comes from his memory. The comparison with OBEs is   interesting because one of the most consistent features of spontaneous OBEs is   that the experiencers claim 'it all seemed so real.' if it were a kind of   hallucination similar to these drug- induced ones then it would seem real. Put   together the information from the subject's cognitive map in memory, and an   hallucinatory state in which information from memory is experienced as though it   were perceived, and you have a good many of the ingredients for a classical OBE.

  But what of the differences between   hallucinations and OBEs? You may point to the state of consciousness associated   with the two and argue that OBEs often occur when the person claims to be wide   awake, and thinking perfectly normally. But so can hallucinations. With certain   drugs consciousness and thinking seem to be clearer than ever before, just as   they often do in an OBE. An important difference is that in the OBE, the objects   of perception are organized consistently as though they do constitute a stable,   physical world. But such is not always the case; there are many cases which   involve experiences beyond anything to be seen in the physical world.

  Consideration of imagery and hallucinations   might provide some sort of framework for understanding the OBE. It would be seen   as just one form of a range of hallucinatory experiences. But (and this is a big   but) if the OBE is basically an hallucination and nothing actually leaves the   body, then paranormal events ought not necessarily to be associated with it.   People ought not to be able to see distant unknown places or influence objects   while 'out of the body'; yet there are many claims to such an effect.

    What are the features of OB   vision?

  In the late 1960s Charles Tart began the   first laboratory tests with subjects who could have OBEs voluntarily [Tar67,   68]. In addition to his physiological research he also tested subjects' ability   to see a target hidden from their normal sight. His first subject, Miss Z., was   tested in a laboratory where a target was placed on a shelf about five and a   half feet above the bed where she lay. The target was a five-digit number   prepared in advance by Tart and placed on the shelf Miss Z. slept in the   laboratory on four occasions. On the first she had no OBE; on the second, she   managed to get high enough to see the clock, and on third night she had an OBE   but traveled elsewhere. However, on her fourth and last night she awoke and   reported that she had seen the number and it was 25132. She was right on all   five digits which has a probability of only one in 100,000 of being right by   chance.

  Tart himself seemed reluctant to conclude   that it was paranormal. Tart's second subject was Robert Monroe, who came to the   laboratory for nine sessions, but he was only able to induce an OBE in the   penultimate session, and then he had two. During the first of these OBEs he   seemed to see a man and a woman but not to know who or where they were. In the   second he made a great effort to stay 'local' and managed to see a technician,   who was supposed to be monitoring the apparatus. With her he saw a man whom he   did not know was there and whom he later described. It turned out that this was   the husband of the technician, who had come to keep her company. Since Monroe   did not manage to see the target number, no real test of ESP was possible.

  in 1971 Karlis Osis began to plan OBE   research at the American SPR, One of the first subjects to be tested there was   Ingo Swann, who went to the laboratory two or three times a week where Janet   Mitchell tested him to see whether he could identify a target placed out of   sight. A platform was suspended from the ceiling about 10 feet above the ground   and divided into two. On either side of a partition various objects were placed   and Swann was asked to try to travel up to see them. The reason for the   partition was to see whether Swann would identify the correct target for the   position in which he claimed it to be. Bright colors and clear familiar shapes   seemed most successful and glossy pictures or glass did not work well for the   experimental purposes.

  After his OBE, Swann usually made drawings of   what he had 'seen.' Although these drawings were far from perfect renderings of   the original objects, they were similar enough that when eight sets of targets   and respondes were given to an independent judge she correctly matched every   pair; a result which is likely to happen by chance only once in about 40,000   times [Mit73].

  The results of all these experiment were most   encouraging. From Tart's results especially it seemed that although it was very   hard for the subject to get to see the number, and that if the number was seen,   it was seen correctly. Further research showed that OB vision could be just as   confused and erratic as ESP has always seemed to be. For example Osis [Osi73]   advertised for people who could have OBEs to come to the ASPR for testing. About   one hundred came forward and were asked to try to travel to a distant room and   to report on what objects they could see there. Osis found that most of them   thought they could see the target but most were wrong. He concluded that the   vast majority of the experiences had nothing to do with bone fide OBEs. This   conclusion means that Osis was using the ability to see correctly as a criterion   for the occurrence of a genuine OBE.

  Much of the recent research on OBEs has been   directed towards that important question; does anything leave the body in an   OBE? On the one hand are the 'ecsomatic' or 'extrasomatic' theories which claim   that something does leave. This something might be the astral body of   traditional theory or some other kind of entity. Morris [ Mor73] has referred to   the 'theta aspect' of man which may leave the body temporarily in an OBE, and   permanently at death. On the other hand there are theories which claim that   nothing leaves. Some of these predict that no paranormal events should occur   during OBEs, but the major alternative to consider here is that nothing leaves,   but the subject uses ESP to detect the target. This concept has been referred to   as the 'imagination plus ESP' theory.

  This last theory is problematic. The term ESP   is a catch-all, is negatively defined, and is capable of subsuming almost any   result one cares to mention. How then can it be ruled out? And given these two   theories, how can we find out which, if either, is correct? In spite of the   difficulties several parapsychologists have set about this task. Osis, for   example, suggested that if the subject in an OBE has another body and is located   at the distant position, then he should see things as though looking from that   position. If he were using ESP he should see things as though with ESP.

  This general ideal led Osis to suggest   placing a letter 'd' in such way that if seen directly (or presumably by ESP) a   'd' would be seen, but if looked from a designated position a 'p' would appear,   reflected in a mirror. Following this idea further he developed his 'optical   image device' which displays various pictures in several colors as in four   quadrants. The final picture is put together using black and white outlines, a   color wheel, and a series of mirrors. By, as it were, looking into the box by   ESP one would not find the complete picture. To do so can only he achieved by   looking in through the viewing window [0si75].

  Experiments with this device were carried out   with Alex Tanous, a psychic from Maine. Tanous lay down in a sound-proofed room   and was asked to leave his body and go to the room containing the device, look   in through the observation window and return to relate what he had seen. Osis   recounts that at first Tanous did not succeed, but eventually he seemed to   improve.

  On each trial Tanous was told whether he was   right or wrong and was thus able to look for criteria which might help to   identify when he was succeeding. On those trials which he indicated he was most   confident about, his results 'approached significance' on the color aspect of   the target; Osis claimed that this aspect was most important for testing his   theory because some of the colors were modified by the apparatus and would be   very hard to get right by ESP. The next tests therefore used only a color wheel   with three pictures and six colors. This time overall scores were not   significant but high-confidence scores for the whole target were significant and   in the second half of the experiment Tanous scored significantly on several   target aspects, especially the one which Osis claimed required 'localized   sensing.'

  Blue Harary, who has provided so much   interesting information about the physiology of the OBE, was tested for   perception during his OBEs, but according to Rogo [Rog78c] he was only   'sporadically successful' on target studies and so research with him   concentrated on other aspects of his experience.

  Apart from all these experiments there is   really only one more approach which is relevant to the question of ESP in OBEs   and that is work done by Palmer and his associates at the University of Virginia   in Charlottesville. They tried to develop methods for inducing an OBE in   volunteer subjects in the laboratory and then to test their ESP. One can   understand the potential advantages of such a program. If it were possible to   take a volunteer and give him an OBE under controlled conditions, when and where   you wanted it, half the problems of OBE research would be solved. It would be   possible to test hypotheses about the OBE so much more quickly and easily, but   alas, this approach turned to be fraught with various problems.

  First Palmer and Vassar [PV74a, b] developed   an induction technique based on traditional ideas of what conditions are   conducive to the OBE. Using four different groups of subjects in three stages,   the method was modified to incorporate different techniques for muscular   relaxation and disorientation. Each subject was brought into the laboratory and   the experiment was explained to him. He was then taken into an inner room to lie   on a comfortable reclining chair and told that a target picture would be placed   on a table in the outer room.

  The stage of the induction consisted of   nearly fifteen minutes of progressive muscular relaxation with the subject being   asked to heard a pulsating tone both through headphones and speakers which   served to eliminate extraneous noises and produce a disorientating effect. At   the same time he looked into a rotating red and green spiral lit by a flashing   light; this stage lasted a little under ten minutes. In the final stage he was   asked to imagine leaving the chair and floating into the outer room to look at   the target, but here several variations were introduced. Some subjects were   guided through the whole process by taped instructions while other were simply   allowed to keep watching the spiral while they imagined it for themselves. For   some the spiral was also only imagined and for some there was an extra stage of   imagining the target.

  When the procedure was over the subject   filled in a questionnaire about his experiences in the experiment and completed   an imaginary test (a shortened form of the Betts QMI). Then five pictures were   placed before him. One was the target, but neither he nor the experimenter with   him knew which it was. When he had rated each of the pictures on a 1 to 30   scale, the other experimenter was called in to say which was the target.

  One of the questions asked was, Did you at   any time during the experiment have the feeling that you were literally outside   of your physical body? Of 50 subject asked this question 21, or 42%, answered   'yes.' As for the scores on the targets, overall scores were not significantly   different from chance expectation. When the scores were compared for the 21   OBEers and the others there was no significant difference between them. The   OBEers did get significantly fewer hits than expected by chance, but this result   difficult to interpret.

  Palmer and Lieberman [PL75a, b] took the   techniques a stage further, Forty subjects were tested, but this time they had a   visual ganzfeld: that is, half ping-pong balls were fixed over their eyes and a   light was shone on them so as to produce a homogenous visual field. Half the   subjects were given an 'active set' by being asked to leave their bodies and   travel to the other room to see the target, while the other half were given a   'passive set' being asked only to allow imagery to flow freely in their mind.

  As expected more of the 'active' subjects   reported having felt out of their bodies: 13 out of 20 as opposed to only 4 in   the passive condition. The active subjects also reported more vivid imagery and   more effort expended in trying to see the target, but when it came to the ESP   scores both groups were found to have scores close to chance expectation and   there were no significant differences between them. However, those subjects who   reported OBEs did do better than the others and significantly so. This result is   quite different from the previous ones and is the opposite of what Palmer and   Lieberman predicted, but it is what one would expect on the hypothesis that   having an OBE facilitates ESP.

  Palmer and Lieberman put forward an   interesting suggestion as to why more subjects in the active condition should   report OBEs. Their idea is related to Schachter's theory of emotions, which has   been very influential in psychology. This theory suggests that a person   experiencing any emotion first feels the physiological effects of arousal,   including such things as slight sweating, increased heart rate, tingling   feelings, and so on, and then labels this feeling according to the situation as   either anger,' 'passionate love,' fear' or whatever. In the case of these   experiments the subject feels unusual sensations arising from the induction and   then labels them according to his instructions, If he were told to imagine   leaving his body and traveling another room he might interpret his feelings as   those of leaving the body. Of course this suggestion has far wider implications   for understanding the OBE than those relating to the evaluation of the results   of these experiments.

  In the next experiment Palmer and Lieberman   tested 40 more subjects, incorporating suggestions from Robert Monroe's methods   for inducing OBEs. The was no ganzfeld and instead of sitting in a chair the   subjects lay on beds, sometimes with a vibrator attached to the springs. This   time time 21 subjects reported OBEs; and, interestingly, these score higher on   the Barber suggestibility scale, but they did not have better ESP scores.

  in the final experiment in this series 40   more subjects were tested, 20 with ganzfeld and 20 were just told to close their   eyes [Pal79a]. This time 13 in each group claimed to have had on OBE, but   whether they did or not was not related to their ESP scores. This time EEG   recording was also used, but it showed no differences related to the reported   OBEs. All in all it seems that these experiments were successful in helping   subjects to have an experience which they labeled as out of the body, but not in   getting improved ESP scores or in finding an OBE state identifiable by EEG.

  In an experiment designed to look at the   effect of religious belief on susceptibility to OBEs, Smith and Irwin [SI81]   tried to induce OBEs in two groups of students differing in their concern with   religious affairs and human immortality. The induction was similar to that   already described, but in addition the subjects were given an OBE questionnaire   and were asked to try to 'see' two targets in an adjacent room. Later their   impressions were given a veridicality score for resemblance to the targets. No   differences between the groups were found for either OBE-ness or veridicality,   but there was a highly significant correlation between OBE-ness and   veridicality. This result implies that the more OBE-like the experience, the   better the ESP.

  All these experiments were aimed at finding   out whether subjects could see a distant target during an OBE. Although the   experimental OBE may differ from the spontaneous kind, a simple conclusion is   possible from the experimental studies. That is, OBE vision, if it occurs, is   extremely poor.

    How can the OBE be explained?

  Most theories of the OBE either claim that   something leaves the physical body, or that it does not. Then within these two   major categories there are several different types of explanation, and there is   perhaps a last possibility; that any such distinction is meaningless and   artificial. The theories can be divided up as follows [Bla82]:

  A. Something leaves the body.  

  	1. Physical theories
  	2. Physical astral world theory
  	3. Mental astral world theory

  B. Nothing leaves the body   

  	1. Parapsychological theory
  	2. Psychological theories

    Something Leaves the Body

  Physical Theories

  (a physical double travels in the physical   world)'

  First there is the kind of explanation which   suggests that we each have a second physical body which can separate from the   usual one. There are two aspects to consider, one being the status and nature of   the double which travels, and the other being the status and nature of the world   in which it travels. In this theory both are material and interact with the   normal physical world. You may immediately dismiss this notion, saying that the   double is non-physical.

  To make this theory even worth considering it   is necessary to assume that this double is composed of some 'finer' or more   subtle material that is invisible to the untrained eye. This kind of idea is   sometimes expressed in occult writings. The idea appears, for example, as the   'etheric body' of the Theosophists. Objections to this type of theory are   numerous, and are made on both logical and empirical grounds. First, what could   the double be made of? The possibilities seem to range between a complete solid   duplicate and a kind of misty and insubstantial version. Another problem with   this kind of double is its appearance. If all have a second body why does it   appear to some as a blob or globe, to other as a flare, or light, and to yet   others as a duplicate of the physical body? Muldoon and Carrington [MC29]   wrestled with this problem and so has Tart [Tar74b].

  If the notion of a physical double is   problematic, the notion that it travels in the physical world is just as much   so. First there are the types of errors made in OB perception. These tend not to   be the sort of errors which might arise from a poor perceptual system, but seem   often to be fabricated error, or additions, as well as omissions. Then sometimes   the OB world is responsive to thought, just as in a dream the scenery can change   if the person imagines it changing; and lastly, there is the fact that many OBEs   merge into other kinds of experience. The OBEer may find himself seeing places   such as never were on earth, or he may meet strange monsters, religious figures   or caricature animals. All these features of the OBE make it harder to see the   OB world as the physical world at all, and lead one to the conclusion that the   OB world is more like a world of thoughts.

    Physical Astral World Theory

  (a non-physical double travels in the   physical world)'

  Many theories have suggested that the double   is not physical but non physical, even though it travels in the physical world.   Many occultists believe there to be a whole range of non-physical worlds of   differing qualities. Let us look at some examples of this sort of theory to try   to find out what is meant by it. Tart [Tar74b, 78] refers to it as the 'natural   explanation. He describes this theory of the OBE as follows '... in effect there   is no need to explain it; it is just what it seems to be, Man has a non-   physical soul of some sort that is capable, under certain conditions, of leaving   the physical seat of consciousness. While it is like an ordinary physical body   in some ways, it is not subject to most of the physical laws of space and time   and so is able to travel at will.'

  The Theta aspect' has been mentioned in   connection with detection experiments. Morris et. al. [MHJHR78] explain that   '.,. the OBE may be more than a special psi-conductive state; they hold that it   may in fact be evidence of an aspect of the self which is capable of surviving   bodily death. For convenience, such a hypothetical aspect of the self will   hereafter be referred to as a Theta Aspect (T.A.).' According to Osis and   Mitchell [OM77] it is possible that '... some part of the personality is   temporarily out of the body, and many occult theories involve a non- physical   astral double rather than a physical one.

  Blackmore criticizes this view [Bla82]. She   claims if the 'soul' is to interact with the objects of the physical world so as   to perceive them then it should not only be detectable, but all the other   problems of previous theories arise. On the other hand, if this 'soul' does not   interact with the physical, then it cannot possibly do what is expected of it in   this theory, namely travel in the physical world. She sees no escape from the   dilemma. Moreover, she claims there is already evidence that what is seen in an   OBE is not, in any case, the physical world.

  Mental   Astral World Theory

  (a non-physical double travels in a   non-physical, but 'objective,' astral world)

  Each of the theories presented thus far   support a conclusion that OBEs do not take place in the physical world at all,   but in a thought-created or mental world. Each of the next three types of theory   start from this premise, but they are very different and lead to totally   different conceptions of the experience.

  The term 'mental world' could mean several   different things. It could mean the purely private world created by each of us   in our thinking. One possibility is that there is another world (or worlds)   which is mental but is in some sense shared, or objective and in which we can   all travel if we attain certain states of consciousness. The important question   now becomes whether the OB world is peculiar to each individual, or shared and   accessible to all.

  Occultists have suggested that there is a   shared thought world. There are many other versions of this kind of theory. The   pertinent features of this idea are that there is a non-physical OB world which   is accessible by thought, that it is manipulable by thought, and that it is the   product of the mind of more than just one person.

  Tart 74b, 78], as one of his five theories of   the OBE, suggests what he calls the 'mentally-manipulatable-state explanation.'   He raises here the familiar problem of, as he puts it 'where the pajamas come   from.' That is, if the OBE involves the separation of a 'spirit' or 'soul' we   have to include the possibility of spiritual dinner jackets and tie pins. Of   course any theory which postulates 'thought created' world solves this problem.   Tart therefore suggested that a non-physical second body travels in a   non-physical world which is capable of being manipulated or changed by 'the   conscious and non-conscious thoughts and desires of the person whose second body   is in that space.'

  In 1951 Muldoon and Carrington had come to a   similar conclusion [MC51]. Muldoon states '... one thing is clear to me -- the   clothing of the phantom is created, and is not a counterpart of the physical   clothing.' Through his observations he came to the conclusion that 'Thought   creates in the astral, In fact the whole astral world is governed by thought.'   But he did not mean it was a private world of thoughts.

  Also relevant here is the occult notion of   thought forms. Theosophists Besant and Leadbeater describe the creation of   thought forms by the mental and desire bodies, and their manifestations as   floating forms in the mental and astral planes. All physical objects are   supposed to have their astral counterparts and so when traveling in the astral   one sees a mixture of the astral forms of physical things and thought created,   or purely astral, entities.

  There are other versions of a similar idea.   For example Whiteman questions the 'one-space theory' of OBEs [Whi75] and   Poynton follow him suggesting what is described is not the physical world as   actualized by the senses of the physical body, but a copy, more or less exact,   of the physical world' [ Rogo [Rog78b] suggests that the OBE takes place in a   non- physical duplicate world which is just as 'real' to the OBEer as our world   is to us.

  The idea of shared thought world, attractive   as it is, has some serious problems. The first problem relates to how the   thoughts of different people could be combined together to create an astral   world and the second problem concerns the storage of ideas. The idea that   thoughts can persist independently of the brain has been a cornerstone of many   occult theories, but also parapsychologists have used a similar idea to try to   explain ESP.

  According to Blackmore [Bla82] the problem is   essentially one of coding. We know that when a person remembers something he has   first processed the incoming information, thought about it, structured it, and   turned it into a manageable form using some sort of code. We presume that the   information persists in this form until needed when the person can use the same   coding system to retrieve it and use it. Even if we don't understand the details   of how this system works, there is in principle no problem for one person   because he uses the same system both in storing the material and retrieving it.   But if thoughts are stored in the astral world, then we have to say that one   person can store them there and another can get them out again. And that other   person may have entirely different ways of coding information. So how can these   thoughts in the astral possibly make sense to him?

  Nothing   Leaves the Body

    Parapsychological Theory

  (imagination plus ESP)

  The OBE might involve only imaginary   traveling in a private imaginary world. According to this type of theory,   nothing leaves the body in an OBE. The advantage of such a theory is that it   avoids all the problems of the previous ones since it involves no astral worlds   and other bodies. Certain parapsychologists have tried to incorporate the   evidence that ESP occurs during OBEs by suggesting that the OBE is 'imagination   plus ESP' or PK. For example, one of Tart's five theories is the   'hallucination-plus-psi explanation.' According to this theory, 'For those cases   of OBEs in which veridical information about distant events is obtained, it is   postulated that ESP, which is well proved, works on an unconscious level, and   this information is used by the subconscious mind to arrange the hallucinatory   or dream scene so that it corresponds to the reality scene' [Tar81].

  Osis [Osi75] contrasts his 'ecsomatic   hypothesis' with 'traveling fantasy plus ESP' and Morris [ compares the theory   that 'some tangible aspect of self can expand beyond the body' with what he call   the 'psi- favorable state' theory. In parapsychology many states have been   thought to be conducive to ESP. They include relaxation, the use of ganzfeid or   unpatterned stimulation, and dreaming. There are many reasons why an OBE might   be thought of as a psi-conductive state. Palmer suggested that it might induce   attitudes and expectations consistent with psi, thereby facilitating its   occurrence [Pal74].

  This sort of theory is not satisfying.&nbsp;   It appears to avoid all the previous problems and yet to be able to cope with   the paranormal aspects of the experience. According to Blackmore 'Calling the   OBE imagination or hallucination tells us very little, and adding the words   'plus ESP' adds nothing. We know little enough about ESP. It is defined   negatively, and we cannot stop and start it or control it in any way.'

    Psychological Theories

  This theory amounts to the statement that all   the details of the OBE are to be accounted for in psychological terms. Nothing   leaves the body in an OBE, the astral body and astral world are products of the   imagination and the OBE itself provides no hope for survival. Osis has called   the followers of such theories 'nothing but-ers,' reducing the OBE to 'nothing   but a psychopathological oddity' [Osi81]

  Among psychological approaches there have   been psychoanalytic interpretations, analogies between the 'tunnel' and the   birth experience; the creation of the double has been seen as an act of   narcissism or as a way of denying the inevitable mortality of the human body.   Then there have been theories which treat the near-death experience as a form of   depersonalization or regression to primitive modes of thinking, and those which   treat it as involving an archetype.

  John Palmer used a mixture of psychological   and psychoanalytical concepts in his account [al78a]. He made the crucial point   that the OBE is neither potentially nor actually a psychic phenomenon, An OBE   may be associated with psychic events but the experience itself, just like any   other experience, is not the kind of thing which can be either psychic or not.   He went on to suggest that the OBE almost always occurs in a hypnagogic state.   Within this state it is triggered by a change in the person body concept which   results from a reduction or other change in proprioceptive stimulation. This   change then threatens the self concept and the threat activates deep unconscious   processes. These processes try to re-establish the person's sense of individual   identity as quickly and economically as possible in a way that follows the laws   of the Freudian primary process. According to Palmer it is this attempt to   regain identity which constitutes the OBE.

  Since the whole purpose of the OBE is to   avoid a threat, the person will usually remain unaware of that threat and of the   change in body image which precipitated it. However, Palmer adds that it is   possible, with practice, to gain ego-control over the primary process activity.   Of course the OBE is, at best, only a partial solution to the threat and both   ego and primary process strive to regain the normal body concept. As soon as   they succeed the OBE ends. For Palmer any psychic abilities which manifest   themselves during an OBE do so more because of the hypnagogic state than because   anything leaves the body.

  This theory has much in its favor. It has no   need of astral bodies or other worlds and so avoids all the problems of the   earlier theories, it makes sense of the situations in which the OBE occurs, and   the way it varies with the situation, and it relates the OBE to other   experiences. However, the theory is not without its own problems. It depends   heavily on the idea that the OBE is a means of avoiding a threat to the   integrity of the individual and the anxiety which such a threat would arouse.   But it is not clear that the OBE would not provide an even greater threat than   the original change in body concepts. Sometimes OBEers are terrified that they   will not be able to 'get back in' which is surely also a threat.

  Susan Blackmore [Bla82] bases her theory on   the claim that the evidence of paranormal events during the OBE is limited and   unconvincing. She therefore asserts that the claims for ESP and PK in OBEs are   not impossible but there is actually not very much evidence which has to be   'explained away in this fashion. Blackmore suggests that the OBE is best seen as   an altered state of consciousness (ASC) and is best understood in relation to   other ASCs. Everything perceived in an OBE is a product of memory and   imagination, and during the OBE ones own imagination is more vividly experienced   than it is in everyday life. in other words the experience is a kind of   privileged peek into the contents of one's own mind.

  Blackmore suggests that in the case of the   OBE the following are necessary:  

  	vivid and detailed imagery; low reality   	testing so that memories and images may seems 'real'; sensory input from the   	body reduced or not attended to; awareness and logical thinking maintained,   	She shows how these prerequisites can lead to an altered state of which one   	form is the semi- stable OBE and indicates related states, such as lucid   	dreaming, and shows how experience can change into others when conditions,   	or ways or thinking, change.

  This theory accounts adequately for cases of   so-called traveling clairvoyance, where the subject does not necessarily see his   body, but is aware of a distant scene. It accounts less well for cases of   conscious projection, where the subjects feels himself to be at a distant   location and is actually perceived by a person at that location. It also   underestimates the veridical aspect of perception in cases where there is no   apparent distortion by the imagination, in other words when the scene viewed   from another point of space corresponds exactly with what one might expect to   observe from that point; for instance a room seen from the vantage point of the   ceiling. The question of perceptual distortion is related to the degree of   interference by the imagination: the greater the imaginative element, the less   veridical the perception of the place.

  Stephen LaBerge describes a theory in which   OBEs occur when people lose input from their sense organs, as happens at the   onset of sleep, while retaining consciousness [LL91]. This combination of events   is especially likely when a person passes directly from waking into REM sleep.   In both states the mind is alert and active, but in waking it is processing   sensory input from the outside world, while in dreaming it is creating a mental   model independent of sensory input. This model includes a body. When dreaming,   we generally experience ourselves in a body much like the 'real' one, because   that is what we are used to. However, our internal senses reside in the physical   body, which when we are awake inform us about our position in space and about   the movement of our limbs. This information, is cut off in REM sleep. Therefore,   we can dream of doing all kinds of things with our dream bodies - flying,   dancing, running from monsters, being dismembered - all while our physical   bodies lie safely in bed.

  During a WILD, or sleep paralysis, the awake   and alert mind keeps up its good work of showing us the world it expects is out   there - although it can no longer sense it. So, then we are in a mental dream   world. Possibly we feel the cessation of the sensation of gravity as that part   of sensory input shuts down, and then feel that we are suddenly lighter and   float up, rising from the place where we know our real body to be lying still.   The room around us looks about the same as it would if we were awake, because   such in image represents our brain's best guess about where we are. If we did   not know that we had just fallen asleep, we might well think that we were awake,   still in touch with the physical world, and that something mighty strange was   happening a departure of the mind from the physical body.

  The unusual feeling of leaving the body is   exciting and alarming. This, combined with the realistic imagery of the bedroom   is enough to account for the conviction of many OBE experients' that 'it was too   real to be a dream.' Dreams, too, can be astonishingly real, especially if you   are attending to their realness. Usually, we pass through our dreams without   thinking much about them, and upon awakening remember little of them. Hence,   they seem 'unreal.' But waking life is also like that -- our memory for a   typical, mundane day is flat and lacking in detail. It is only the novel,   exciting, or frightening events that leave vivid impressions. if we stop what we   are doing, we can look around and say, 'Yes, this world looks solid and real.'   But, if you look back and try to recall, for instance, brushing your teeth this   morning, your memory is likely to be vague and not very life-like. Contrast this   kind of event to a past event that excited or alarmed you, which is likely to   seem much more 'real' in retrospect.

  Other approaches

  Perhaps all the distinctions and problems are   artificial, perhaps the mind is neither 'in' nor 'out' of the body. Grosso   argues the possibility [Gro81] that one is always 'out' and in an OBE just   becomes conscious of that fact. Should the distinction between normal and   paranormal then be dropped?

  Let us consider the state of affair that is   considered normal: the 'in-the- body' experience. What does it mean to be in a   body? LaBerge [LL91] argues that saying that one is in a body implies that the   self is an object with definite borders capable of being contained by the   boundaries of another object - the physical body. However, we do not have any   evidence that the self is such a concrete thing. What we think of as   'out-of-body' in an OBE is the experience of the self. This experience of being   'in' a body is normally based on perceptual input from the senses of both the   world external to the body and the processes within the body. These things give   us a sense of localization of the self in space. However, it is the body, and   its sense organs, that occupy a specific locus, not the self. The self is not   the body or the brain. If we think that the self is a product of brain function,   even this does not make it reasonable to state that the self is in the brain --   is the meaning contained in these words in this page? It may not make any sense   on an objective level to say that the self is anywhere. Rather, the self is   where it feels itself to be. Its location is purely subjective and derived from   input from the sensory organs.

  Putting aside the question of the essential   nature of the self, perception is undeniably a phenomenon tied to brain   function. So, when we find ourselves experiencing a world that seems much like   the one we are used to perceiving with our usual equipment -- eyes, ears, etc.,   all things linked to our brains, it would be logical to assume that it is our   usual brain creating the experience. And, if we were to really leave our bodies   -- severing all connection with them -- it would be illogical to assume that we   would see the world in the same way. Therefore, LaBerge points out, although no   amount of contradictory evidence can rule out the possibility of a real 'out of   body experience,' in which an individual exists in some form entirely   independent of the body, it is highly unlikely that such a form would utilize   perceptual systems identical to those of the physical human form.

  Spiritual teachings tell us that we have a   reality beyond that of this world. LaBerge concludes that the OBE may not be, as   it is easily interpreted, a literal separation of the soul from the crude   physical body, but it is an indication of the vastness of the potential that   lies wholly within our minds. 'The worlds we create in dreams and OBEs are as   real as this one, and yet hold infinitely more variety. How much more   exhilarating to be 'out of in a world where the only limit is the imagination   than to be in the physical world in a powerless body of ether Freed of the   constraints imposed by physical life, expanded by awareness that limits can be   transcended, who knows what we could be, or become?' [LL91].

  Most people taking part in discussions of   OBEs seem primarily interested in developing and ability to do so themselves and   to learn to control the experience.
