There were hundreds of people of all denominations walking with me. I wasn't scared; in fact, I felt euphoria and excitement.  It was as if we were on a path, or road. Different colored bright lights were rushing past me, and it was like walking out of a dark tunnel. The next minute, I felt like I woke up on some beautiful green grass that went on for miles and miles. To my right was a river and to my left was a wooden fence that also went on for miles. I felt like I was little again, maybe 5 years old, and I was looking for a gate. There was a man on the other side painting flowers, and I remember saying, 'Excuse me, can you lift me over, as I can't find the gate,' to which he replied, 'This isn't your time, you've got to go back. There are things you for you to do.' The next minute, I was running back through the people, knocking against them, saying 'sorry' as I ran. And then I woke up.
