this is one the cautionary tale
when stan meyer&#39;s collection of
technologies were acquired by this other
entity and i
said whoever gets it tell them they have
to do it open source
in front of the whole world the whole
world&#39;s going to be watching this
technology being refined developed
police
without any intellectual property pulled
back without patent
because otherwise they&#39;re not going to
survive their launch
i got this call a couple years later who
had ended up being the money behind that
acquisition and he says
these people are running for their lives
they are looking for an eco-friendly
country
that they can get to because they&#39;re
they&#39;re being threatened in america i
said you&#39;d have to go to another star
system
you there&#39;s no plan place on this planet
where the the henchmen
of these kind of fourth reich fascist
won&#39;t find you and they didn&#39;t want to
let go of them the greed and profit move
they wanted to be the next rockefellers
of energy you see
so
that is the achilles hill next thing i
know i meet with a guy in orange county
california who knew one of the people
who was with that engineering team and
the man said this guy came in was crying
like a baby
because every single one of them had
been killed and the technology
vanished you
