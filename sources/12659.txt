They had to keep me overnight for observation. I had an IV and an antibiotic. The nurse got me out of bed to sit up. I passed out or something. 

I saw a bright light and went to it.  There I saw my mother, grandmother and mother-in-law who approached me.  They told me that I have unfinished business and had to raise my sons since I had just got divorced.  I woke up screaming, 'NO, No!' I like it here!' 

The nurse and doctors tried to say I had a reaction to the antibiotic but I woke all sweaty and my IV was out and I was all wet.
