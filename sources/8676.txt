6 months before I met   my soulmate, he walked into an Academy store&nbsp;to buy a gun to end his life. He   had just lost his teenaged son very suddenly to an illness. Fortunately the man   working the gun counter wouldn't give him the time of day and was busy talking   about&nbsp;fishing with another customer. So my soulmate ended up buying a weight   bench with his $150 that day and prayed that God would send someone into his   life so he wouldn't be so lonely.

Six months   later,&nbsp;after two years of interviewing and job hunting, I was finally offered a   job and jumped on the opportunity to&nbsp;get away from a bad work environment.   That's where I met him. From the first time we met, I knew there was something   very special about him. I enjoyed our conversations so much. We ate lunch   together almost everyday.&nbsp;At first it wasn't physical attraction or romantic. We   were just instantly&nbsp;best friends,&nbsp;kindred spirits.

A year past by and I   noticed I couldn't stop thinking about him after I left work for the day.   Unbeknownst to me, he was feeling the same way. It took me 6 more months to get   the courage to tell him how I was really feeling because I was so afraid of   losing our friendship. To my delight, he felt the same way about me. We have   been inseparable ever since! We just celebrated our 2nd wedding anniversary and   I have never laughed as much or felt more joy in my life. The relationship has   been very healing for both of us&nbsp;since we each had been through really bad&nbsp;first   marriages. We both faced so much adversity prior to meeting each other but now   everything is so easy.&nbsp;

Good things are   always happening as if&nbsp;the universe is saying we are finally on the right path.&nbsp;    </body>
