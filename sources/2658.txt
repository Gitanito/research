FOREWORD
My opinion on the slibject of psychic photography is
valuelessiforil cannot claim any real study of the subjecg
I0once had Deane hereifor av few ekperimenitsjbut
I never saw I-Iope at all. I was impressed by the American
testimony of Dr; Cushman.
o i i
I have, however, long been aware of the immense
amount oi work that Mr. Warrick has put into the subject
and the0quantityiofieitperience he has had in connection
with it. I can but commendithe peirtinacity with iwhich
he has pursued the subject, and his notes must be of great
value to any student of the subject hereafter. For it is
the persevering enquirer who attains results in any branch
of science, and only by long-continued and laborious
investigation can anyone liope to arrive0 at the truth of
this complicated and controversial subject.

PREFACE
'— “his work is not intended for the general public, but for experienced students
of psychic phenomena. The latter only are able to believe that the various
o
facts herein narrated really did occur, and that the author has not been
the victim of continuous fraud, especially during his many sittings with Mrs.
Deane, who was the main subject of his experiments.
It is advisable to mention at the outset that I am fully alive to the possibility
of fraud and trickery and that they constitute the great difﬁculty in experi
mentation in the ﬁeld of psychics, and that trickery is (however respectable
the medium or subject) ten thousand times more probable than supernormal
occurrences.
At the same time I would point out that trickery in the taking of photo
graphs under reasonably strict conditions is by no means as easy as is stated
in some quarters, and such continuous trickery over a period of twenty-seven
years (as in the case of Mr. Hope) without detection in the very act is unthinkable.
That there are many psychic photographs which bear witness on the face
of them that materials have been used to produce them which one would use
in a normal way were the conditions of a character to allow of such means being
used normally, even when the Extras were produced in the indubitable absence
of these conditions, has long been known to students of the subject. The
Budgets of the Society for the Study of Supernormal Pictures of ﬁfteen
years ago have many such observations. Mr. TRAILL TAYLOR, Editor of the
British journal of Photography, and for fourteen years Editor of the British
Almanac of Photography, wrote forty years ago of an Extra he obtained under
water-tight conditions, that it was
"
as if a portrait, cut out of a photograph by
a can-opener or equally badly clipped out, were held behind the sitter," yet
the conditions of the experiments precluded all possibility of trickery. This
case is fully reported in The Veil Lij'ted by Andrew Glendinning, and in Coates’
Photographing the Invisible.
Are these suspicious features really the result of trickery? Here at least,
is a branch of psychics worthy of experimentation, as these Extras (abnormal
markings or pictures) seem to be the products either of unbelievable willingness
and ability to cheat, or of some abnormal faculty possessed by special mediums
to operate outside of the laws of time and space as we know them (Zollner's
Fourth dimension) ; the unexpected results of my H and F experiments with
Mrs. Deane and some of my experiments with Hope, and my reading, have
convinced me that trickery alone is not the solution of the baffling problem of
psychic photography. When this part of the problem is solved, that is to say,
when we have found a satisfying explanation of how these mundane methods
and materials have been used, we shall be in a better position to tackle the
more difﬁcult problem of the appearance on photographic plates of what seem
to be memory pictures or thoughtforms, possibly stored in the hypothetical
Fourth dimension.
The experiments made by me and recorded in this work are, in my view,
free from trickery. Where I have any doubt I mention the fact. My method
of working made the control in very many cases quite efﬁcient. In many of
the results obtained there was absolutely no possibility of trickery.
'
X EXPERIMENTS IN PSYCHICS
The above assertion of assurance does not cover the table elevation experi
ments carried out in dark séances, illustrated in chapters VIII and IX. I
attach no importance to them—such elevations have been proved times without
number. I include the pictures as a matter of interest. It may be considered
that some of them carry in themselves proof of the absence of trickery. The
circle sat without payment for their own gratiﬁcation more or less weekly for
over three years.
As regards cheating, my H and F experiments put that on one side as
the probable origin of all the abnormal phenomena I obtained with Mrs. Deane,
otherwise I must be credited with an utter lack of sense and honesty.
Many of the results obtained through the mediumship of Mrs. Deane and
others, recorded in this book, are so certainly beyond normal possibilities
that no mere postulation of trickery can nullify those particular pieces of
evidence.
It is obvious that there is some abnormality in persons producing psychic
phenomena. If it is some outside intelligence acting upon them, it is not
unreasonable to presume that in time the moral judgment and control of some
mediums may be disturbed by the methods employed by the outside intelligences
to make use of their mental equipment. One asks oneself whether, if some Jules
Fabre of the coming years were to learn to
"
connect up
"
unobserved with some
member of an insect community, he would not act in just such an irresponsible
schoolboy manner as do poltergeists and also induce actions in his unsuspecting
victim (the insect medium) which its fellow insects would characterise as fraud.
To render my meaning quite clear the fanciful suggestion on my part is
that, just asI imagine the supposititious Fabre of the future might act with
insects for his amusement, so a supposititious invisible intelligence may be
acting with human beings (mediums) here and there.
Such ideas are in the air. MAURICE MAETERLINCK, speaking in L'A raignée
dc Vern of the apparent stupidity of insects under certain experiments, says :—
"
It is natural enough that an insect should understand nothing of the
matter and not know where he is when we put problems before him and
play tricks and pranks with him which he has never encountered in his
normal existence. Should we not be just as disconcerted, should we not
lose our heads just as much if a being incomparably more powerful and
with more intelligence than ourselves put us to similar tests ; besides, who
knows whether, unknown to us, we are not submitted to analogous inﬂuences."
The way that genuine psychic phenomena are mixed with apparently
’fraudulent ones (as in psychic photography) forces one to some such theory.
I know that a host of Deane phenomena are genuine, and I cannot believe that
a person conscious of having cut out and photographed a piece of paper with
its screen marks and edges of white paper due to faulty cutting would have
allowed the sitter or myself to possess the Deane Extras shown in Figs. 19 to 21.
Testimony, in addition to my own published herein, to the many perfectly
genuine phenomena on the part of Mrs. Deane is to be found in Miss Estelle W.
Stead's book Faces of the Living Dead, and in such journals as The Two Worlds
and Light
As to myself,* I am aware that the evidence of a single person is not
regarded as of much value by the superi in metapsychics, but it was impossible
for me to obtain co-operation in such a long series of experiments. I can assure
the reader I have carried out my investigations into these psychic matters with
oProfessor Floumoy says :—-"Authors who express an opinion upon things extraordinary
which come to their knowledge should always commence by making a confession of faith
in order that the reader may be in a better position to estimate the factors which have
inﬂuenced the author's judgment."
PREFACE X1
_W.S— — r "0 - 0 0 0 d ' Q

as cool a head as I have brought to my business aﬁ'airs. I started with
no prejudice in favour of the supernormal. In my youth I attended a course
of biology under Prof. Ray Lankester, read books by T. H. Huxley, Herbert
Spencer, Haeckel and all R.P.A. reprints as they appeared, so my views were
decidedly to the contrary. I have canied out my investigations of psychic
photography simply with a desire to discover some fact new to present knowledge.
I have no theory to support.
I quote the following from an article on psychic research written some years
ago by a man of scientiﬁc standing and ability :—
“
If the results of a number of solitary workers supported each other
and all pointed in the same direction, then although each case singly might
be weak yet all the cases taken together would be strong. The argument
would be cumulative. Moreover, solitary effort would not exclude combined
effort and it would then be time to judge of the value of the former when
we had seen how it tallied with the latter.
"
I think, therefore, that, taking into consideration the rarity of mediums
and the immense interest and importance of the phenomena it established,
it would be extremely unwise to exclude any avenue of evidence, and that we
should rather be ready to receive whatever we can get. We could then
judge of each case on its own merits, and of the whole by its cumulative
effect."
As many of the results obtained by me are concrete and illustrated they may
be of use to future students of metapsychics.
The only conclusion I can draw (much against my general way of thought) is
the presence, when good results were obtained, of some intelligent being acting
in the manner a human being might act, but invisible to our eyes, and able
to overcome the laws of space and time as we know them, and capable of
reading my thoughts and memory.
Whether this power, showing intelligence, is an outcome of the medium's
psychic make-up as the animists think or a power existing outside the medium
but using the medium, is the great question. That the mediumistic gift is often
hereditary is something in favour of the ﬁrst hypothesis.
DR. OSTY wrote in the Revue Métapsychique, March/April, 1934, on Mlle.
Jeanne Laplace, who possesses remarkable clairvoyant power, with whom the
doctor has experimented for eight years :—
"
As is often the case, her gifts were inherited, both her mother and
her grandmother having been psychics, a cousin also."
(Light, May 25th, 1934.)
What I may say about the source of such phenomena carries little weight,
so I quote below the statements on this matter made by men of great eminence.
SIR OLIVER LODGE
in his autobiography Past Years, summing up his attitude to Psychical
Research, writes:—
"
My testimony, and that of others, to the reality of
the spiritual world is based upon direct experience of fact, and not upon
theory. Test the facts by whatever way you choose, they can only be
accounted for by the interaction of intelligences other than our own."
(Light, 4th December, 1931.)
XII EXPERIMENTS IN PSYCHICS
PROFESSOR CHARLES RICHET
said in his 5. P. R. presidential address in 1905 :—“ Metapsychic physical
forces are differentiated from other physical forces in one essential particular.
They are intelligent. The formidable problem immediately arises: are
they human or extra-human ?
"
I confess without fear that I do not see any a priori scientiﬁc reason
to repel the idea of the intervention of intelligent beings other than man.
The hypothesis of intellectual forces which revolve round about us in this
mysterious immensity of nature is neither unreasonable nor impossible."
BARON VON SCI-IRENCK-NOTZING,
great German medical pioneer of Psychical Research, author of the well-known
work, Materialisations Ph/inomena, and other important books. Writing of
teleplastic morphogenesis, to which he devoted years of experimentation and
study, inclines to the view of the presence of a dominating organising
dynamism which manifests itself outside the body and separate from it.
(p. 636 of the supplementary volume, in German, to the ﬁrst edition.)
ALFRED RUSSEL WALLAcE, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S.,
writes in the preface to On Miracles and Modern Spiritualism :—
“
Having been led by a strict induction from facts, to a belief, ﬁrst, in
the existence of a number of preterhuman intelligences of various grades ;
and, secondly, that some of these intelligences, although usually invisible
and intangible to us, can and do, act on matter, and do inﬂuence our minds,
I see no escape from the conclusion that some spiritual being, acquainted with
mymother's various aspects during life, produced these recognisable impressions
on the plate."
SIR WILLIAM CROOKES, F.R.S.,
whose experiments with the mediums D. D. Home and Florence Cook are so
well known, wrote :——“All that I am convinced of is that invisible and
intelligent beings do exist who say that they are the spirits of dead persons."
(Quoted by Sir. A. Conan Doyle in Light 1921, p. 249.)
PROF. WILLIAM JAMES,
the great psychologist, wrote shortly before his death:
"
That the daemon
theory (not necessarily a devil) will have its innings again is to my mind
absolutely certain" (Encyclopwdia of Psychic Science,
1).
266.)
The REV. C. DRAYTON THOMAS,
well known as a most shrewd and cautious investigator, said at the
Copenhagen Congress in 1921, speaking of newspaper tests :—
"
I
am satisﬁed that no theory of fraud, conscious or unconscious, on
the part of the medium can account for the facts; and that no assumed
extension of powers of the medium can assist us in solving the problem."
DR. HEREWARD CARRINGTON
the well-known author of many standard books dealing with psychic matters
(see Catalogue of the library of the S.P.R.) wrote in the preface to his work
The Story
of
Psychic Science that his interest in the subject began when he
was eighteen years old. He joined the British S.P.R. when he was nineteen,
at which time he began reading books dealing with the subject, mostly
along the lines of magic and what
is
known as "anti-spiritualistic tricks."
All his life he has been an amateur conjuror and these books stimulated
his innate scepticism. He has devoted himself to psychic research in
a
way
that few others have and the subject has occupied his main time and thought
for the last thirty years.
PREFACE XIII
Dr. Hereward Carrington wrote me recently (1936) :—
“
In order to clarify the problem, I should begin by distinguishing very
clearly between facts, and interpretations of those facts.
“
As to the facts themselves, I have no doubt that a large proportion of
psychic and spiritistic phenomena are real, that is, they exist as genuine
phenomenal occurrences.
“
As to their interpretation; I am convinced that the majority of them
are not spiritistic in character, but are due to unrecognised powers of the
medium. There remains a small residuum, however, which is strongly
spiritistic in appearance, and for which the spiritistic explanation seems at
present the most logical one."
T. GLEN HAMILTON; M.D., .
of Winnipeg, Ontario, has won a world-wide reputation as a careful and
reliable scientiﬁc investigator of psychic phenomena. Some of the
marvellous results obtained in his own home were published (with illustrations)
in several numbers of Psychic Science. In the issue of that journal for
January, 1934, he writes as follows :—
"
[The various phenomena produced], taken in conjunction with the
various controls' constant display of pre-knowledge regarding each and
every psychic event registered, make it necessary for the Winnipeg experi
menters to accede to the probabilities, ﬁrst, that the intelligences back of
the Mary M-Ewan-'Vlercedes manifestations enjoy a supemormal existence
independent of and apart from the mediums through whom they communi
cate, operate and manifest ; and, second, that in their metetherial state of
existence they would seem to be cognizant of certain objective realities in
appearance very like our own."
STANLEY DE BRATH, M.I.C.E.,
well known as an experimenter, writer, and editor of Psychic Science, the
quarterly of the British College of Psychic Science, states in his work Psychical
Research, Science and Religion, that psychic phenomena indicate external
intelligence ; a living agency.
0
Writing of the Dr. Geley "Extra" he obtained, he favours the view that
the Extra is due to the action of some discarnate agency.
DR. GEORGE LINDSAY JOHNSON, M.A., M.D., B.S., F.R.C.S.,
author of The Great Problem, says :—" Such cases [psychic photography]
prove conclusively to my mind that there are discreet intelligences around
us which under ordinary circumstances, do not reveal themselves to us in
any way."
JAMES COATES
author of Photographing the Invisible, a standard work on psychic photo
graphy, writes :—
"
To my mind the true value of either mental or physical phenomena
will be found in the discovery of the exterrene or discamate minds operating
in or behind the phenomena induced." (p. 262, second edition.)
DR. JULIEN Ocnonowrcz.
wrote in an article concerning Eusapia Paladino :—
“
In my view it is neither a person other than the medium nor a new
independent and occult force, but a special psychic state which permits the
vital dynamism of the medium (' astral body' of the occultists) to act at a
distance under certain exceptional conditions. It is the only hypothesis
which seems to me necessary in the actual state of my knowledge."
(Annales des Sciences Psychiques, 1896, p. 104.)
XIV EXPERIMENTS IN PSYCHICS
DR. ERCOLE CHIAIA,
wrote to Dr. J. Ochorowicz :—
"During ten years of experiments made nearly daily with Eusapia
Paladino I have conﬁrmed several times results not only nil but contradictory
until at last I became convinced of the perfect good faith of the medium who
becomes the absolutely passive instrument of the occult and intelligent force
which aids her and calls itself
'
John '."
(Annales des Sciences Psychiques, 1896.)
SIGNOR ERNESTO BOZZANO,
of Savona, the doyen of Italian psychical researchers, author of about forty
books on psychic subjects, ﬁnds it impossible to exclude the evidence of an
external personal will behind the phenomena.
In his most recent book Polyglot Mediumship he maintains that such
mediumship deﬁnitely proves "the intervention in mediumistic experiences
of spirit entities independent of the medium and of those present."
PROFESSOR ENRICO MORSELLI
late Professor of Psychiatry at Genoa University, author of Psicologia e
Spiritisme, was converted to the reality of psychical phenomena by Eusapia
Paladino with whom he conducted rigorous experiments. To escape from
their implication of discarnate intelligences he worked out a psycho-dynamic
theory of materialisation, a compromise between the psychological orthodoxy
of his day and the spirit theory. He attempts to explain the purpose and
intelligence behind the phenomena by the distant action of the medium's
psychism.
CAMILLE FLAMMARION
the well-known French astronomer, writes in Mysterious Psychic Forces,
(T. Fisher Unwin, London) pp. 436 to 438, that he agrees with Aksakof that
Eduard von Hartmann's hypotheses of the subconscious are not sufﬁcient
to explain all psychic phenomena ; there still remains the psychic element,
the nature of which is wholly hidden from us. He states :—
"We must not hide from ourselves that these phenomena introduce us
into another world, into an unknown world, one that is still to be explored
in its whole extent. As to beings different from ourselves—what may
their nature be? Of this we cannot form any idea."
He says the agents seem sometimes to be independent, showing the action
of an unknown intellect, and gives examples on p. 437, averring that we
have a thousand examples of this kind. He adds :—" In psychical phe
nomena there is a voluntary, capricious, incoherent, intellectual element."
and on pp. 452-453 gives the conclusions to which he has come, namely :—
(1) The soul exists as a real entity independent of the body.
(2) It is endowed with faculties still unknown to science.
(3) It is able to act at a distance, without the intervention of the senses.
I may sum up the whole matter with the single statement that there exists
in nature, in myriad activity, a psychic element the essential nature of which
is still hidden from us."
ALEXANDER N. AKSAKOF,
Imperial Councillor to the Czar, editor of Psychische Studien, was an
indefatigable psychic experimenter. He wrote an important work Animism
und Spiritism published in French and German. It was an answer to
Dr. EDUARD VON HARTMANN'S Spiritism wherein Dr. Hartmann tried to
prove that all psychic phenomena could be explained by the assumption
of exalted powers in the subconsciousness of mediums. Aksakof's con
clusion was that while certain mediumistic phenomena can be explained
by the hypothesis of psychic duplication of the medium there remain further
phenomena which require for their explanation the hypothesis of the action
of some intelligent force apart altogether from the medium.
PREFACE XV
DR. GUsTAvE GELEY
Director for some years of the Institut Métapsychique International of
Paris, one of the greatest authorities on Psychical Research, wrote in his
classical work From the Unconscious to the Conscious (p. 278) :—
"If I am permitted to give my personal impression from what I have
observed in the domain of mediumship, I would say, although one is not
able in any special case to afﬁrm spiritistic intervention with scientiﬁc
certitude, yet one ﬁnds oneself obliged, willy-Dilly, to recognise, taking the
phenomena en bloc, the possibility of this intervention. As regards myself
I consider the action, in mediumship, of intelligent entities distinct from the
medium, as probable."
JAMES H. HYsLoP, Ph.D., LL.D.,
formerly Professor of Logic and Ethics in Columbia University and founder
of the independent American S.P.R., wrote in his work Contact with the Other
World :—
"History shows that every intelligent man who has gone into this
investigation [of psychics] if he gave it adequate examination at all, has
come out believing in spirits.
“If we once grant the existence of spirits, incarnate 0r discarnate, we
must admit it to a place among the causes in nature ; indeed we shall hardly
discover its existence save through its effects. All that we do is to insist
on evidence; and only the prejudices for a theory [of materialism] that
relies as much on tradition as do the orthodoxies of religion, now stand in
the way of a ready belief in the existence of discarnate spirits."
W. J. CRAWFORD, D.Sc.,
at Belfast with Miss Kathleen Goligher in a long series of brilliant experiments
studied the mechanics of telekinesis.
Some of his results were attested to by the late Sir William Barrett, F.R.S.,
and others. He was in the habit of speaking of
“
operators," that is to say,
the invisible beings behind the phenomena.
SIR WILLIAM F. BARRETT, F.R.S.
Professor of Physics at the Royal College of Science of Dublin, describes
in his work On the Threshold of the Unseen various experiments which
thoroughly convinced him of the reality of psychic phenomena. He states :—
"
That there is an unseen intelligence behind these manifestations is all
we can say, but that is a tremendous assertion
"
(p. 79).
PROFESSOR JOHANN C. F. ZoLLNER,
Professor of Physical Astronomy at the University of Leipzig, whose investi
gations into psychic phenomena are well known, accepted beyond any
doubt the agency of an invisible intelligence as shown by several passages
in his Transcendental Physics (translation by Mr. C. C. Massey).
ROBERT HARE, M.D.,
Emeritus Professor of Chemistry in the University of Pennsylvania, wrote
of an experiment he made :—
“
I submit these facts as proving that there must have been an invisible
intelligent being at work during the experiment."
I _quote the above high authorities, who have formed their opinions after
experimenting.
This list could have been easily enlarged with outstanding names, past
and present.
The great philosopher KANT said (Trait0me eines Geistersehers, etc.) :—
"I confess that I am much disposed to assert the existence of immaterial
natures in the world."
XVI EXPERIMENTS IN PSYCHICS
EDWARD BULWER LYTTON,
in a letter to Lady Combermere in 1854 wrote :—
"There may be intermediate beings of mixed nature, not deliberately
evil nor steadily benevolent, capricious, uncertain, and only able to get at
imperfect rapport with humanity. They may amuse themselves with
taking feigned names and sporting with mortal credulity, and be delusive
and erring prompters without any settled motive .... ..They may be very
injurious to ordinary understandings, and very disappointing to the highest."
Bulwer Lytton as Occultist, p. 33, by C. N. Stewart, 1927.
MAURICE MAETERLINCK
This well-known writer, very familiar with psychic phenomena, wrote in
Le Royaume des Marts of "invisible beings which probably surround us."
RUDYARD KIPLING
in an address to the Royal College of Surgeons in February, 1924, said :—
"
Man is an imperfectly developed animal, intermittently subjected to
the unpredictable reactions of an unlocated spiritual area. The reactions
will always remain unpredictable, to the annoyance of those who would like
to reproduce them in a laboratory."
(Quoted by Sir L. Jones, Light, 14th April, 1933).
Such statements give countenance to the likelihood of the facts recorded in
this book being truly facts, and give me courage to publish it.
Once admit that there is an intelligence behind all such psychic phenomena
it is not difﬁcult to concede that the intelligence possesses the power of choice
and exercises it. This would explain the capricious character associated with
all psychic results. The capriciousness seems to be more than what one would
expect from dissimilarity of conditions solely.
Professor RICHET, who has interested himself so deeply in psychical research,
pointed out in one of his lectures the great difﬁculty of the subject and gave
encouragement to his hearers in these words :—" Fortunately for objective
psychology there is something which goes beyond observation, there is
experiment."
Experimentation is open to everyone who has the enthusiasm, the patience,
the necessary funds and can ﬁnd the suitable medium. A labourer with a pick
axe can unearth new ores for the learned to analyse and maybe a Becquerel may
start, from a humble labourer's efforts, a new and interesting branch of science.
As a labourer in the ﬁeld of psychics I have endeavoured to collect simple
psychic phenomena, especially of supernormal photography, under experimental
conditions, and struck unexpectedly a vein of
“
Direct writing."
When once it is recognised that psychic photography is a fact it may become
a most abundant source of knowledge. The experimental method has hardly
been used in connection with it up to the present. It is really astonishing to
contemplate what psychic photography portends. It stands out as one of the
most novel facts with which mankind has become acquainted, perhaps, since
the invention of the microscope, for these supernormal photographs could not
have been produced without the functioning of some intelligent skilful invisible
agent.
DR. G. LINDSAY JOHNSON (already quoted) who among his many other
qualiﬁcations is an expert photographer (medallist), and a Fellow of the Royal
Photographic Society, London, writes concerning supernormal photography :—
"
These phenomena are among the most easily veriﬁed of all supernormal
occurrences. They are exceedingly striking and well worthy of scientiﬁc
examination, because the experiments can be repeated as often as one wishes,
and in all the experiments I have made I have hardly ever had a failure."
é
PREFACE XVII
My reports may be considered of value on account of the number of them
and of the conditions under which the results were obtained, and because they
are simple in character and can easily be repeated with a suitable medium.
The study of the simplest phenomena of a new science may be the best
avenue of attack; the nature of
“
ﬁre
”
was learnt by simple experiments in
the laboratory, not by the study of the imposing exhibitions of its effects in
gigantic conﬂagrations.
v
It requires a great mass of testimony to arrest the attention of men of science
to the reality of these supernormal or unusual facts. Therefore, every contri
bution to the collection of these facts is of value.
Scientists—that is, those dealing with matter—are ﬁshing in rivers of the
material world and must not pass judgment on the ﬁsh landed by those who
adventure on the ocean of occultism. They cannot justly express any opinion
about the ﬁsh caught by me, unless they are willing to ﬁsh in similar waters.
They must recognise that the ﬁsh—that is, the facts—landed by me may
reasonably be quite unlike the facts they land from their streams. Indeed,
those who have adventured on the ocean of occultism, have always landed
phenomena similar to such as are recorded herein (see Holms’ Facts of Psychic
Science and Philosophy and Dr. Fodor's Encyclopedia of Psychic Science).
‘ Professor Richet wrote :—
"
Do not allow ourselves to be turned from the truth by the strangeness
j/
of the phenomena. It is not a question as to whether a fact disturbs our!
conception of the universe, for our conception of the universe is terribly'
infantile." _
Perhaps the record of the experiments contained in this work may direct
the attention of the controllers of some wealthy organisation in this country.
devoted to the acquisition of new knowledge, to the extraordinary opening into
an absolutely fresh class of facts amenable to scientiﬁc investigation, which
psychic photography affords. When an institution of high standing and men of
eminence take this problem seriously in hand and transfer it from the some
what moist ﬁeld of sentimentality to the hard open ground of knowledge for the
sake of knowledge, those among our fellow-creatures who possess the rare
attribute of inducing Extras on photographic plates will no longer fear to
make known their curious power and will assist the devotees of science in their
endeavours to fathom this great mystery.
Here and there a person so gifted may be found willing, for an honorarium,
to contract to submit himself for a deﬁnite number of years to experimentation,
agreeing to reserve his power exclusively to the contracting body. By some
such method one may hope to advance beyond the bare collection of facts.
The expense involved would be triﬂing compared with present-day outlay on
many scientiﬁc instruments. If psychic photography is a fact, and one has only
to study the evidence impartially to know that it is, how much more valuable
for advancing our insight into man's surroundings is a psychic photographer,
than (for that purpose) even an unlimited supply of radium.
It goes without saying that no investigation of this kind would be under
taken without some training and a previous perusal of the best literature on
the subject ; especially to be recommended is the introduction written many
years ago by Mr. C. C. Massey to his translation of Eduard von Hartmann's
Spiritism, a short extract from which is here given :—
"
The demand for scientiﬁc examination of this subject usually assumes
that nothing more is requisite than habits of observation and acuteness
acquired in physical experimentation. For success in this inquiry those who
undertake it should in general be qualiﬁed by sympathies and interests
intimately concerned in the elicitation of the phenomena. The mere
physicist, or physiological psychologist, is too little likely to touch the
XVIII EXPERIMENTS IN PSYCHICS
springs of the subtle forces which are liberated by mental, though not
always conscious dispositions. It would be the grossest mistake to assume,
however, that only emotional and uncritical partisans of mediums are there
fore likely to meet with a success which they would thus be unqualiﬁed to
verify satisfactorily for others."
COUNT C. DE "ESME, the distinguished continental author and psychical
researcher, whose work A History of Experimental Spirilualism was laureated
by the French Academy of Science, wrote in Psychica, Dec. 1933 1-—
"
Good mediums have developed best in a mystical, spiritualistic
atmosphere. Almost invariably great investigators who began with non
spiritualist convictions and purely materialistic methods, have discovered
that such an attitude militated against the success of their experiments, and
that the best results were obtained by conducting their sittings as though
in full agreement with the spiritualistic claims made by the medium in
question. Schrenck-Notzing, somewhat brutal in his methods in earlier
days, came to grasp fully this essential point, viz., that it is necessary
never to oppose the medium 's opinions as to the subconscious personiﬁcations
to whom they attribute the nature of spirit-guides, unless you wish unwisely
to inhibit their best and most interesting phenomena.
"As soon," says DE VESME, "as such mediums pass from the hands
of Spiritualists into those of anti-Spiritualists, you see their faculties wane and
often entirely die out. It is folly to expect a plant to ﬂourish and bear seed
unless it is nourished and suitably cared for ; mediumship is an emotional
faculty, and it can only develop freely in a similar atmosphere."
(Light, Dec. 22nd, 1933. Quotation from Psychica, Dec. 1933.)
“
The difﬁculty of this branch of science," writes BARON VON
SCHRENCK-NOTZING, "
does not lie in the difficulty of observation but in
the difﬁculty in obtaining the psycho-dynamic mediumistic phenomena
which, as is the case with the creative act in art, are in a high degree dependent
upon the sympathy (gefiihlsmassige Einstellung) of the experimenter and the
spiritual atmosphere (geistiges Milieu) of those assisting."
PROF. RICHET says the facts of objective metapsychics are exceptional.
Mediums producing physical phenomena, ectoplasm, materialisations, move
ment without contact are exceedingly rare. We are always seeking at the
Institut Mélapsychique to ﬁnd such mediums.
In view of the great scarcity of mediums for physical phenomena it seemed
to me to be worth while to make an intensive study of Mrs. Deane's powers.
I am much indebted to the late Sir William Barrett and to Sir Oliver
Lodge for the encouragement given me in my investigations and to Mrs. B.
McKenzie of the B.C.P.S. for her kind help, to Miss Estelle W. Stead for
allowing me to use some of her prints, also to the late Mr. Henry Blackwell for
much information and many photographs given me, to Mr. Fred Barlow for
the beneﬁt of his labours on behalf of the S.S.S.P. and his other writings on
psychic photography (his conclusion on the subject is, however, contrary to
mine), to Messrs. L. N. Fowler & Co. publishers of Photographing the Invisible
by James Coates, for permission to make many references to that book, to
Mr. George H. Breaker for the record of his work with Mr. Hope printed in
chapter VI, to Mrs. Donohoe for her contribution, to the late Dr. T. Glen
Hamilton for having allowed me to reproduce the photograph illustrated on
page 288, to Messrs. Fratelli Bocca, publishers of Fotograﬁe di Fantasmi by
Dr. Enrico Imoda for their kindly consenting to my including two illustrations
from that work (p. 325), to the editors of Psychic Science and Light for numerous
references to their journals, and, not least, to Mrs. Deane for her great patience
in submitting to my many experiments ; and to many others who contributed
to or assisted me in my work.

CHAPTER I.
Introduction.
HIS work is mainly a record of a large number of experiments carried out
T with the medium, Mrs. Ada Emma Deane (née Marriott), known as a
psychic photographer. I have included some notes on a few experiments
carried out for me with Mr. Hope, producer of psychic photographs for years.
The easy, but in view of the mass of the evidence, surely the extraordinary,
conclusion on the part of those making a study of metapsychics, that all psychic
photographs are the production of fraud, led many researchers to consider the
subject not worthy of attention.
If 'the present record of my prolonged experiments with Mrs. Deane is
accepted as representing things that really happened, the fact is established
that Mrs. Deane does undoubtedly possess great mediumistic powers, which
tend to strengthen one's belief in the possibility of abnormal results found
on her photographic plates (under good test conditions) being the work of, or
through, some peculiar quality in her.
The study of metapsychics, especially physical, is making great progress on
the Continent, where it is in the hands of many trained experimenters—medical
men, science professors and other university graduates—and it is now generally
agreed by them that fraud, or what appears to be fraud, possibly through our
lack of understanding—does not debar one from accepting as genuine those
phenomena which have been produced under unimpeachable conditions of control.
Speaking of the medium Guzyk, Dr. Osty, the Editor of the Revue
ll0létapsychique, says that Guzyk's mediumistic powers must not be judged, if
one is impartial and has good judgment, by the few instances where the
possibilities and apparent presence of fraud are evident, so long as there remain
a good number which are incontrovertibly genuine.
This view is supported by the well-known authority on psychic phenomena,
Herr Studienrat Rudolf Lambert, acknowledged to be a very reasonable and
cautious critic, who wrote in the Zeitschrift fair Parapsychalogie in May, 1930:
“
With physical, as with mental mediums, one must examine to what extent
the frequent automatic, yea, in part perhaps conscious, aids (Nachhilfen) are
capable of explaining also the good séances."
Whatever the ultimate explanation, the great Eusapia Paladino is reported
to have tricked at times, and in the course of my experiments with Mrs. Deane
there were occasions when the apparent presence of trickery was photographically
proved, as reported in these pages, but there remain a number of unimpeachable
results which I record in this work.
Experiments with human beings, especially with mediums, are difficult ;
there is the personal element, with all the feelings, humours, indispositions and
contrariness of humanity. There is also much legitimate suspicion attending
all productions of the marvellous—the possibility of fraud must always in such
work be technically considered as the certainty of it ; the result is that the bias
against mediums is very great. (Which they resent, and this increases the
difficulties.) Added to which psychically gifted persons are generally con
sidered to be more uncertain in their moods than others.
One must bear in mind also what all workers in this ﬁeld have discovered,
namely, that the production of phenomena with mediums is most capricious.
Page 1
Page 2 INTRODUCTION .
The conditions under which one can be sure of ’results have not yet been
discovered. As regards Mrs. Deane, we often had results when we least expected
0 them, and vice versa.
Taking all these things into consideration therefore, after much experimenting
on my own part and much reading of English, American, French and German
literature on this subject, I endorse the proposition that mediums who produce0
some psychic phenomena which are genuine without question should be considered
worthy of study. In the case of Mrs. Deane, the number of such phenomena
witnessed by me and by others is very great, and the quantity of them which
are genuine, without a shadow of doubt, is surely sufﬁcient to establish the
fact that it is worth while to experiment with a medium of this type.
As regards such experiments, all results in connection with which there is
the slightest doubt, should be put into a class apart and be disregarded. It
must always be borne in mind that mediums, when undergoing experiments,
are in an abnormal state, allied to the hypnotic, where the self-controlling
faculties are the ﬁrst to be suppressed.
Until, therefore, the subject is thoroughly understood' let us, where there
are, with certainty, some genuine phenomena, accept them, and leave out of
account all those which are questionable, not thinking evil of the source of them,
ever mindful of our present ignorance of psychic causes or inﬂuences.
As this book is addressed to students of this new science, meta or parapsychics,
Iwill not waste time and space with a disquisition upon psychic phenomena in
general, and the support given to the results here detailed by the many published
accounts of similar happenings. Those with most experience will know that the
strange things herein noted may indeed be facts, however unusual and inexplicable.
The late Dr. Abraham Wallace, President of the Society for the Study of
Supernormal Pictures, a medical man who was quite capable of holding his own
in the medical world, and, it goes without saying, possessed of 0more than
ordinary intelligence, has stated that no supemormal happenings would
astonish him, so great has been the variety, so extraordinary the nature of the
phenomena which he has witnessed in the psychic realm during his very many
years of research.
It must be remembered that the number of physical mediums is very small,
and the number of serious investigators is also very small, and the number of
such serious investigators who can come in contact with and study mediums
of special abilities—who will allow themselves to be studied—is smaller still.
That is the reason why the facts of such mediumship are, at the present day,
not accepted by the scientiﬁc world.
Not many years ago the falling of matter from space on the earth's surface
was similarly derided, as the happenings were witnessed by very few people;
there is nearly as little opportunity of carrying out experiments in psychic
photography as in that connection.
Very few experimenters in psychics have had the privilege of such a ppolonged
series of experiments with one medium under such good conditions as has
fallen to my lot, enabling me to make constant repetition of the same trials,
which is the very essence of experimentation.
I have experimented to the best of my ability, with no theory to support,
but simply to satisfy my curiosity, and with the unfulﬁlled ambition to solve
the great riddle of psychic photography, and I have set down a true and
accurate account of things as I saw them.
Dr. Enrico Imoda, author of Fotograﬁe di Fantasmi0, says :— "The
affirmation—precise, categorical, implicit—0t a single honest observer cannot
INTRODUCTION. Par. (1) Page 3
be countered by all the sceptics, however respectable and numerous, who
deny a fact or an experiment which they did not witness."
Here let me state at once that I am fully aware that charges of fraud have
been brought against Mrs. Deane and the Crewe Circle. I have dealt with the
question of fraud in chapter II and in the Appendix. To bar investigation of a
medium because she was once accused of tricking is a great pity, as mediums
such as Mrs. Deane are very rare.
A short history and other particulars concerning her are given in chapter X.
It is brought against Mrs. Deane that she will not submit herself to tests.
This is not a fact. She has submitted to innumerable tests; a number of her
sitters tried tests upon her, among these many professional photographers.
As regards tests, when properly approached in the past—before she was
rendered somewhat bitter by the treatment meted out to her—she was always
willing to fall in with any suggestion.
She has a very independent spirit and cannot be driven.
(I) As a crowning example of her tractability in the direction of tests, I will
remind readers that she stayed a few days in the neighbourhood of
Sir Oliver Lodge, to be tested by him, leaving all her apparatus in his laboratory
while she slept elsewhere.
At the experiments, Sir Oliver Lodge and some friends of his were present,
also a skilled photographer, assistant to Sir Oliver. Extras were obtained, but
in view of the short period over which the experiments extended, it was not
feasible or proper for a scientist of Sir Oliver's authoritative position to bring
these evidences forward. Before one can testify to things beyond present
knowledge or likelihood, it is necessary to carry out a prolonged series of
investigations.
Sir Oliver, inﬂuenced by the results obtained, offered Mrs. Deane a fee
for some months' experimentation with her if she would take up her abode in
the country in his neighbourhood. Mrs. Deane had three children to look after
in London, so could not accept his offer.
I have Sir Oliver Lodge's permission to publish the above three paragraphs.
As regards myself, by tact and patience, I early gained Mrs. Deane's
conﬁdence—while not hiding from her that my object was purely and simply
research into her phenomena—so completely, that I have throughout my
labours enjoyed that great desideratum of workers on this subject, namely, the
initiation and control of all experiments. Never has she raised objection to any
test I proposed; she did indeed remonstrate against my use of the house
electric current through fears of an accident to myself.
This is of such great importance that I will repeat it. I had the initiation
and control of all experiments, and when my experiments with the camera
ceased, the whole series of varied experiments’with paper, glass plates, etc., etc.,
from July 10th, 1924, to March, 1927, was initiated by me without any
suggestion on Mrs. Deane's part. She was very rarely informed by me of the
nature of the experiment I intended to perform, and did not know the nature
of it until the various objects were given into her hands and placed in position.
In addition, Mrs. Deane has allowed me access to all her plates, some two
thousand, and permitted me to deal with them in any way I thought ﬁt, by
taking transparencies (reverses), by enlargements, and so forth.
I think it will be agreed that my opportunities have been great. No doubt,
I might have done better with them—I know it—but what I have done I have
done to the best of my ability and the time at my disposal.
The evidence, however, of a single experimenter does not carry much weight.
Many better men than myself have experimented and had unimpeachable
results, and yet their work is not accepted.
Page 4 INTRODUCTION.
As my investigations have been carried on largely as a hobby and afforded
me much entertainment, I am perfectly satisﬁed with the contribution I am
making to knowledge, for at a later date these facts will be recognised as such.
Facts are facts, and will establish themselves in the end. My records may
be of use later in helping to determine the conditions under which these
phenomena occur.
My attention was called to the subject of psychic photography through a
remark of a friend, who enjoyed with me the acquaintance of Mr. Henry Blackwell.
The remark was to the effect that Mr. Blackwell even believed in psychic photo‘
graphy. Seeing an article shortly afterwards by him on the subject, it
occurred to me from his writing that there must be some basis for his belief.
Mr. Blackwell was then good enough to show me a great number of his collection
of over 2,000 psychic photographs, and these photographs, and Mr. Blackwell's
illuminating particulars concerning them, and my further reading on the subject,
carried conviction to my mind that psychic photography was worthy of
consideration. No student of psychic phenomena should visit London without
seeing Mr. Blackwell's collection, and hearing from him the details connected
with many of his interesting prints.*
About this time (1920) Mrs. Deane was becoming known as a new medium for
these products. Up to then Mr. Hope, of Crewe, had been the chief present-day
photographic medium. It was in July, 1920, that Mrs. Deane ﬁrst discovered her
gift, being apprised of it by a spiritualistic medium. Such is her account, which
has been corroborated to me by the medium in question, Mr. Streeter.
It occurred to me that a good ﬁeld presented itself for an attempt to discover
some facts underlying psychic photography, as Mrs. Deane's abode was within
easy reach of my office and chambers. I determined, therefore, to devote my
leisure to the study of her powers.
It has not been my good fortune, however persevering I have been, to make
any discovery which throws light upon psychic photography proper, but, as
will be seen in chapter VII, I have been led by my experiments to discover
marvellous qualities in Mrs. Deane, apart from the photographic domain, and
I think one can conclude that, if the facts in this work are admitted, then a
long distance has been travelled towards the acceptance of her photographic
powers. Indeed, the one category of productions supports the other.
If the "intelligent operator" can do the things here recorded with coarse
and heavy material, it would seem that the photographic plate would offer to
such an intelligent operator an extraordinarily suitable ﬁeld for the exercise
of his powers, for the amount of force and energy required to affect the sensitive
emulsion is slight.
The facts, which the reader will ﬁnd in the following pages, it must be
admitted, are of quite an ordinary character compared with the many marvellous
phenomena recorded in psychic literature and personally experienced by many
living students. The results of my experiments may, no doubt, be regarded
by the illuminati of this subject as not worth while ; but there is one essential
and characteristic feature which I claim for my work, and it is that all experi
ments have been carried out, as far as possible, under test conditions, and been
repeated many times, with the view of rendering them of value in scientiﬁc
research. This is the essential feature of my work. All through my long
experimentation with Mrs. Deane I have never relaxed my vigilance and checks,
regarding, as I do, no results as of any value towards the advancement of
knowledge, which are not absolutely free from doubt.
Up to the present I have conducted over 1,400 experiments with her,
many of them, of course, with no result at all; but there have been a great
number of successful issues, and some of them very remarkable, giving, beyond
' Mr. Blackwell has passed away since the above was written.
a shadow of doubt, proof (to me) of an intelligent entity of some kind, exterior
both to Mrs. Deane and myself, able to read my thoughts, and able to produce
various physical effects. Were I the only person who had described such
abnormal phenomena, the reader would rightly assume that I was either mad
or untruthful, but there are hundreds of cases recorded of a somewhat similar
character by reliable observers.
It was, indeed, difﬁcult for the writer not to lose heart and not to give way to
the recurrent idea that these things cannot be. Time and again I have had to
recall to mind the indisputable evidence of the experiments where letters and
words have appeared, letters and words I had not uttered but only thought of.
These were certainly written, and yet Mrs. Deane could not have written them
physically under the conditions of the experiments. To gain courage in making
the statements I do, I have to call these facts repeatedly to mind, and also
many other evidences obtained by me of the supernormal happenings in her
presence, which are recorded in these pages; and the great number of her
psychic photographs accepted as genuine by other experimenters. If, with all
my experience, and my opportunities for observation, I ﬁnd it still difﬁcult
to brace myself up to put these things in print, how much more difficult must
it be for those who have not been so favourably placed to credit the facts.
Even so great a man as Professor Richet found difﬁculty of the same kind, and
some of the ablest minds dealing with this baffling subject have pointed out
that belief is not a production of logic, but rather a production of habit. In
order that the mind may really accept a very unusual event, the event must
cease to be unusual.
As to what is possible I would refer the reader to Professor De Morgan's
preface to his wife's work entitled From Matter to Spirit, wherein he discusses
The Possibilities ofNature. Prof. De Morgan was a highly-regarded mathematician
of the last century, and his luminous essay is a classic of psychic studies.
0
There is another idea, too, which helps to support anyone faced with these
mysterious facts, and it is the wonderful things in nature which, at ﬁrst blush,
have surely appeared as unbelievable as psychic photography. Take, for
instance, the marvels of the microscope. Would anyone have believed in the
cellular structure of the body, the red blood corpuscles, the lymphocytes and the
many other unicellular organisms revealed by that instrument? Had there
been only one microscope, it is possible that the knowledge revealed by this
microscope would have been the possession of a few, and the laughing stock
of the many.
Now, Mrs. Deane can be looked upon as a similar instrument (a psychoscope),
but, unfortunately, mediums are not like mechanical instruments, which can be
duplicated.
There are many reasons why Mrs. Deane has not been investigated by the
authorities. First and foremost, she is not a tractable person. In the
early days she was accused of fraud after one or two (one or two only !) super
ﬁcial experiments conducted by conjurers, whose whole mind is ﬁlled with
deception, and who see tricks in the simplest movements. My view is that these
gentlemen are mistaken, or, if not mistaken, that some day an explanation will
be forthcoming. Anyhow, the publication of their views damaged Mrs. Deane
in the eyes of many as an object of research.
Secondly, Mrs. Deane takes no interest whatever in research work; she is
not a second Mrs. Piper—far from it.
Thirdly, such experiments necessitate the devotion of far more time than
can be spared by men of science; in addition to which, it would lead to no
career, but be prejudicial to advancement.
Fourthly, as if to stave off investigation into this subject, very many so
called psychic photographs bear obvious evidence of having been produced by
Page 6 INTRODUCTION.
normal means. Here let me state deﬁnitely that I have no doubt whatever but that
some psychic photographs have been produced by photographing in the ﬁrst instance
cut-out pictures placed on cotton wool. The question is, who did it? (See Fig.
66A, page 27.)
I refer the reader to page 14 for my review of this point, and an enumeration
of the many features indicative of normal methods of production. The
normal origin of some Extras by double exposure is so obvious that one cannot
conceive anyone conscious of fraud putting such photographs into circulation ;
were Mrs. Deane conscious of fraud would she have allowed me at my leisure
to examine her complete collection of photographs, knowing, as she did, that
I was of a sceptical turn of mind?
A casual glance at such, seemingly, trick-photographs has no doubt settled
the matter in the minds of most persons without knowledge of the subject, and
been the main obstacle to the serious study of this branch of psychic phenomena.
Another drawback from which psychic photography has suffered is, I think,
the interpretation which has been put upon such photographs from the
beginning, namely, that they are spirit photographs produced by the departed.
Miss Stead, I am afraid, frightened off a good many readers by the title of
her book on the subject, namely, Faces of the Living Dead.
It appears to me that a number of psychic Extras are the photographs of
representations, or pictures; I venture to guess, in some cases, of reproductions
from memory of images ﬁxed in some substance or other, which images we must
all have stored up somewhere within ourselves, or within reach of ourselves, and
that these are accessible to the "operator" through the medium.* Whether
the theory of the production of psychic photographs by discamate human beings
is the correct explanation does not affect my work at all, which has been the
collection of facts, and these the simplest possible.
The oft-suggested animistic explanation leaves the modus ojberandl unknown,
and itself does not cover all the facts of psychic photography.
My serious investigations started with Mrs. Deane in January, 1923.
I determined to adopt a system used by Madame Bisson, namely, to work with
the medium for a long period, and to cultivate an intimacy with her and her
family. This proceeding I have carried out to my entire satisfaction. My
object was to work purely for the advancement of knowledge of these psychic
matters, and not for any sentimental purpose whatever. I saw the absolute
necessity of adopting all means available to me for controlling my experiments,
so that I could be convinced the results obtained were not produced by
fraudulent means, and I used all checks Icould think of; and she raised no
objection to my locking up her hands, or adopting any other devices which
occurred to me.
The ﬁrst series of experiments covered the period from January 29th, 1923,
to July 24th, 1924. The sittings were held once a week, on Mondays. In
addition, from May, 1924, onwards, I attended Thursday mornings as well.
Between the above dates no less than seventy-ﬁve distinct sittings were held.
These seventy-ﬁve sittings were devoted to experiments with photographic
plates, about 300 of which were exposed through the camera, mostly upon
myself, sometimes upon others present; 300 such exposures were made on
glass, and in addition twenty ﬁlms were used. I always brought my own
camera with me. Full particulars will be found of these photographic
experiments in chapter III.
In addition to these exposed plates, I made experiments with about 100
plates which were not exposed in the camera, but held between Mrs. Deane's
hands, or treated in some similar way. Particulars of these experiments will be
found in chapter IV.
oSee Appendix p. 318 (3375).
INTRODUCTION. Page 7
From July 24th, 1924, I instituted quite a new class of experiments. I had
come to the conclusion that many of the effects produced on the photographic
plates used at my sittings with Mrs. Deane originated during the development
of the plates, and, as Mrs. Deane and I had developed together some 400 plates,
my experience was great ; and, taking into account the great care exercised by
me in supervision, I had become convinced that in some way, other than by
fraud, the freakish marks upon the plates were due to the inﬂuence or presence
of Mrs. Deane's hands. It would be strange
if,
during this long series of
experiments,
I
had not discovered trickery on Mrs. Deane's part had there been
such
;
for instance, the application of chemicals.
The general opinion
is
that photographic plates are very easily affected.
I
have not found such to be the case.
I
have dealt fully with this matter in
chapter II. (See page 28.)
Having come to the conclusion, therefore, that these freakish marks on
photographic plates were due to the inﬂuence of Mrs. Deane's hands,
I
determined to try other materials than photographic plates. Chapter VII
is
devoted to such experiments. These
I
call H and
F
(hand and foot) experi
ments. They were conducted from July, 1924, to March, 1927, and since,
sometimes twice
a
week, but later on only once a week. The whole of this
period—that
is
to say, about thirty-three months—was given up to experiments
(about 600) with various materials, among which I will mention plain paper,
wax-paper, frosted glass, ferroprussiate paper (blue print), carbon tissue or
autotype paper, and sooted cardboard. These experiments are very easy of
control, and
I
hope they will be repeated with other mediums.
In my eyes these constitute the really valuable part of my investigations.
I
think
it
will be conceded by those with
a
knowledge of psychic phenomena
that these experiments of mine with Mrs. Deane have been very fruitful, and
that many of the results are, beyond question, supemormal. Among the
results which, in my opinion, are beyond doubt are those where the intelligent
operator present with, or part of Mrs. Deane, or whatever the origin may be,
put on paper words and letters thought of by me and not uttered. Among
these were the words
“
Nell," "
Peggy
"
(written
“
Peggie "),
“
Iris," and
“
Vi,"
the Greek letters
“
M” and
" N," "5” and Gamma.
If
my reports are
credited, these experiments put beyond the shadow of
a
doubt this medium's
power of thought-reading, also of telekinesis and the producing of "Apports,"
and help us to accept her photographic productions also as genuine.
The writing on paper was frequently in chalk, which was placed by me in
a
position inaccessible to Mrs. Deane.
A
statement of this kind appears, of course,
perfectly absurd to the layman, but
I
ﬁnd no less a person than Professor Richet
writes in the Proceedings of The Society for Psychical Research in July, 1925,
as follows :—
“At the island of Roubaud one evening, after
a
séance more or less
interesting, in the presence of Prof. Ochorowicz, Frederic Myers, and Sir Oliver
Lodge, Eusapia Paladino presented the following phenomenon
(I
believe no one
will be able to dispute the competence of these investigators).
I
took in my
right hand Eusapia's right hand, and held my right hand index ﬁnger in such
a
manner that
it
extended well beyond the very small hand of Eusapia. She
then directed my hand and caused my index ﬁnger to promenade on white
paper. As my index ﬁnger moved along the paper
a
mark appeared on this
paper in blue, like
a
blue line. Eusapia held her left hand high in the air,
holding
a
blue pencil, which she clutched convulsively. The phenomenon
occurred in the light of a candle, which was nearly in contact with the paper,
so close was it."
Cesare Lombroso, the celebrated alienist and neuropathologist in his well-
known work After Death—What? described in full the seventeen séances held
in Milan in 1892, with himself, Imperial Councillor Aksakoff, the well-known
Page 8 INTRODUCTION.
psychical researcher and founder of the journal Psychische Studien, Professor
Richet, Dr. Ermacora, electrician, Professor Angelo Brofferio, Baron Carl Du
Prel, Giorgio Finzi, Gerosa and Schiaparelli with the medium Eusapia Paladino
—séances in which the most marked precautions were taken.
In this description he writes on page 57 :—" One evening, in full light,
Schiaparelli brought a block of new writing-paper and asked Eusapia to write
her name. She grasped his ﬁnger and moved it over the paper as if it were
a pen. She then said
'
I have written,' But we could ﬁnd no trace of writing,
and she showed us that the writing was there, but in the inside of the tablet,
or block of pages. In a second trial the signature was visible on the stick that
held up the window curtain at a height of more than two metres at least, and
nearly four from the table.
In a later trial the name was found to be badly written on the penultimate
page of the tablet of paper, and yet the leaves had not been turned over
nor the tablet lifted up."
In chapter VII of this book will be found accounts of similar results on
inner pages obtained by me with Mrs. Deane.
In this chapter (VII) is included a description of certain apparatus I made
use of in my experiments, namely hand-stocks, to conﬁne Mrs. Deane's hands,
and double-frames with cardboard, similar to double-slates.
Two good friends, very experienced psychic researchers, have recommended
me to omit all mention of the freak marks and of the designs which I suggest
may be seen in the cotton wool
“
surrounds." One wrote me :—
“
I do hope you will omit from your book those references to which
I call 'chance markings.' It will give the critical reader quite a wrong
impression of the author and will tend to belittle the value of the book to
the scientiﬁc worker."
Notwithstanding this good advice I am leaving the latter as originally printed.
It would not be easy at this stage to omit it. I did not appreciate that the
reader might mistake my attitude to these facts and not realise how very neutral
is my position towards the interpretation of the data I have collected, facts
which I think may be of use in psychic research ; if some of them are trivial
(one cannot be sure of that) I would ask the reader to recognise that I may
also so regard them and yet include them—many trivial indications lead the
Indian hunter to his prey.
If I were inclined to delete any matter it would be the reference to my
father's photograph on p15. 44 and 45. If the whole incident is a matter of
coincidence then it is a rather extraordinary one. It will be noted that the
interpretation of the picture (?) is supported by a number of other persons.
CHAPTER II.
Remarks on Psychic Photographs in General
and Mrs. Deane's in Particular.
Of all the phenomena which are at the present day the subject of psychic
research, the most rare, and the least credited, is psychic photography ; and yet
it is really the most easily controlled.
Thatpsychic photography should be considered beneath notice, and be the
subject of contempt on the part of those who have not made a deep study of the
matter, is not to be wondered at, for a number of such photographs have every
appearance of having been produced by trickery (see pages 23, 24 and 27).
Yet it is a fact that all who have made a real investigation of psychic
photography have been forced to recognise that genuine supernormal photographs
have been, and are being produced.
Among such investigators we ﬁnd the names of many highly gifted men
and women: Alfred Russel Wallace, Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge
(see page 3), Mr. Traill Taylor (Editor of The British journal of Photography
and President of the London and Provincial Photographic Association),
Mr. S. W. Woolley (for ten years Editor of The Chemist and Druggist),
Dr. George Lindsay Johnson, M.A., M.D., B.S., F.R.C.S., Miss Scatcherd, and
many professional photographers, among them Mr. W. J. West (late General
Manager for Scotland of, and for 30 years with, Kodak Ltd.) (see page 311).
Let us put a priori prejudice on one side and think the matter over quietly,
as to whether it is possible for the innumerable Extras of the two or three
psychic photographers of the present day to be the results of fraud. Let us
consider the utter impossibility of Mr. Hope or Mrs. Deane, both persons
occupied throughout life mainly with manual labour, certainly without
scientiﬁc training or deftness of hand, having deceived innumerable most highly
gifted and scientiﬁcally trained investigators, not blind bigots, and a great
number of professional photographers during very many years. -
Mention must not be omitted of the great number of recognitions of the
Extra faces.
As the subject is of such great importance (experimental psychic science is
surely of importance) and the standing of the witnesses to the reality of it is so high
and the means employed by them to eliminate fraud so severe, it is a pity that
the critics, especially leaders of psychic research, have never engaged a photo
giapher to prove that such photographs can be produced by him during
a period of six months under the same conditions as prevail at the test sittings
with Mr. Hope and Mrs. Deane, and also produce the same proportion of
recognised Extras, without being detected in trickery. Such proof would indeed
be valuable; and it is due to those whose work in this ﬁeld has constrained
them to assert that many psychic photographs have been proved genuine
beyond doubt.
Let anyone study carefully the whole of the evidence in favour of the
genuineness of this particular phenomenon, and, were it not for the unlikelihood
(in the view of those who forget we know little of the immaterial side of man's
make-up and surroundings) of the possibility of such things as the Extras, he
would come to the conclusion I have reached; a conclusion reached by all*
who have given the subject serious study, namely, that psychic photographs
have been produced in some manner unknown to the mediums or anyone else.

Price's view of the subject.

Page 10 CHAPTER II.
We have therefore unlikelihood only, which is opposed to the logical inference
from the facts. But to allow unlikelihood to warp one's judgment is not the
scientiﬁc method. The scientiﬁc method places experiment above all. As a
humble disciple of the apostles of the experimental method, I have tried to
follow their injunctions.
As mentioned in the Introduction, my interest in psychic photography was
ﬁrst aroused by meeting Mr. Henry Blackwell. This gentleman possesses a
very large collection of such photographs, very many of them obtained by
himself through the medium Robert Boursnell, and through other mediums in
England and America. Mr. Blackwell's knowledge of this subject is encyclopaedic.
No one can justly pass an adverse opinion on psychic photography who has
not viewed Mr. Blackwell's collection of such photographs, and, more important
still, heard what he has to tell about them.
Perhaps he will forgive my saying it, but I think if he had put forward no
theory as to the origin or cause of these extraordinary productions, the attention
of men of science would have been attracted to them.*
The word spiritualism is anathema to the majority of students of natural
phenomena. It is possible, however, to sit at Mr. Blackwell's feet and learn from
his huge store of knowledge of these things, while preserving a perfectly open
mind as to the mysterious origin of them. It is quite inconceivable to me that
anyone can spend a morning with Mr. Blackwell over his photographs, and, if
his mind is not crystallised and set, but is still impressionable, remain un
convinced as to the reality of the mysterious power of some persons by their
presence to cause or enable photographic plates to be inﬂuenced in the manner
under discussion.
As mentioned, Mr. Blackwell sat very frequently with the late Mr. Boursnell.T
Another gentleman who sat frequently with this medium was the late
Mr. S. W. Woolley, at that time a young man, and an expert photographer, and,
as already stated, later for ten years editor of that highly technical trade
journal, The Chemist and Druggist, published in London, Eng.
The amount of knowledge of chemistry, photography, and allied subjects,
and the general ability required of a man to reach and maintain such a position
as editor of that journal, is assuredly very great. Yet Mr. Woolley, in the prime
of life, after many test sittings, using his own marked plates, and himself
developing most of the plates at his own home, became convinced of the
genuineness of the Boursnell productions. It should be mentioned that
Mr. Boursnell operated with plates half-plate size, not easily substituted, if indeed
that question arises. (See Quarterly Transactions of the British College of Psychic
Science, July, 1927.) Mr. S. W. Woolley presented eighty-nine of Mr. Boursnell's
negatives to the College. I quote Mr. S. W. Woolley's experiments, as they
are particularly evidential, for he set himself the task of examining Boursnell's
mediumship with a view to discovering its genuineness or otherwise.
As the great mass of evidence in favour of psychic photography is to be
found in that excellent book Coates’ Photographing the Invisible, I refer the
reader to that work rather than add to the few observations I have made.
It is sad to think that a great number of such curious plates, perhaps
containing some undiscovered but discoverable secret of nature, will be lost
by not being preserved in some museum, for which many of Mrs. Deane's plates
may still be available.
It is not my intention, however, to give a history of psychic photography.
The following are some of the books which can be consulted on the subject :—
* Since the above was written Mr. Blackwell has passed away (I93 5). He collected a mass
of material connected with psychic photography which I think proves the reality of the
phenomena whatever the ultimate explanation of them may be. (Sec Appendix pp. 321 to

Doubtless there have been many more Extras produced on photographic
plates than have ever been recorded; possibly what were Extras have been
mistakenly regarded as due to faults either in the plates or in the developing
and ﬁxing of them, and the results have not been preserved and studied. Some
times it happens that the photographer regards the subject as
“
uncanny," or
contrary to religion.
( 14) A case of the latter came under my notice during the war. It was then the
practice of some kind ladies to take photographs of parents of men at the front
with a view to prints being sent to their sons. A lady well known to an old
and very reliable friend of mine, paid one visit to a humble dwelling in Hoxton,

with the object of producing a likeness of a soldier's mother. On the print
(shown to me) the sitter was seen on the stool, but in addition to the sitter,
there was a man's head, near the woman's head, and an old man's arm was on
her lap, in fact it looked as if two persons were sitting for their photographs on
the same stool at the same time. When the boy's mother (the sitter) was
shown the print, she exclaimed that the Extra, the unexpected photograph,
was that of her father, who lived, and who was still living, a few streets off !
I learnt that the lady photographer had had other abnormal results in her
photographic work, and did not like it, and I was not allowed to retain or
reproduce the print. The lady herself assured me she did not know of the
existence of the father, and had certainly never been to his room. The peculiar
result obtained on this occasion suggests at once the sitter as being the source
from which the picture of her father emanated.
This case—the appearance of many faces of well-known public men, and
such Extras as a photograph in its frame, bring the conviction to one's mind
that some (only some) at least of these Extras are mental pictures conveyed
in some way to the plate.
Another feature pointing in that direction is the similarity of an Extra
to a photograph of a deceased person taken in his lifetime.
(1b) A Mr. J. I. H., who published his experience in Light Feb. 8, 1919, had lost
two sons in the war. He carried the photographs of these boys about with him,
and no doubt solaced himself by looking at them from time to time. Their
faces as photographed were deeply impressed upon his mind. He visited the
"
Crewe Circle" and was photographed by Hope. An Extra appeared on the
plate, a likeness of one of his boys. On comparing it with the picture of the
same lad in the cabinet photograph, the two were seen to be identical. (See par.
(333), p. 314.)
Others show the recognised face as altered by illness, as if the Extra reﬂected
the sitter's latest recollection of the departed. (Vide the well-known Crookes
and Cushman Extras.)
When one reﬂects on the subject, one realises that the pictures thrown on the
retina must be preserved in some substance, possibly other than "matter"
as we know it. In thinking of any object, one can visualise it—many people
very well indeed.
Man's function during life is largely that of a printing machine in two and
perhaps in three dimensions. The mental visualisation of persons, places and
other objects from memory carries with it the obvious conclusion that pictures
of these things are stored away in our memory as accessible psychograms ; see
(33 7b) p. 318. Have these memory tablets anything to do with these curious
photographs ? It seems very likely indeed.
The idea of memory plates being the ultimate source of some Extras, does
not (even if the idea is extended to the existence of huge stores of memory
plates, collected and classiﬁed by some industrious entities, and made use of
by one of them to play with us as one of us may at some future time play with
ants) cover all the varieties of Extras, the nature of which is very diversiﬁed.
I have drawn up a list of the various features I have found among the
Extras seen in Mrs. Deane's photographs.
Here I would earnestly request the reader not to form a hasty conclusion
from the facts and illustrations I proceed to put before him, which are so likely
to mislead one who has not made a fairly deep study of psychic phenomena.
If the reader is open-minded, will he please read this book through ; also the
works enumerated on page 11, especially Coates’ and that of the Rev. Chas.
Hall Cook for psychic photography, Campbell Holms' for general psychic
phenomena, and Dr. Fodor's Encyclopaedia 0f Psychic Science.
VARIETIES OF EXTRAS. Page 13
Varieties of Extras observed by the author
in Mrs. Deane's collection.
(Varieties of Extras seen in psychic photographs produced by
others than Mrs. Deane are not included.)
For Illuslmtions of many of the varieties see pages 15-—26.
1.—The varieties include:—
(a) Dots, dashes, little ovals with comet-like tails, blotches, streaks, sometimes
(rarely) little spots with sharp outlines, reminding one of crystals ; all very
suggestive of the results of the action of chemicals upon the plates. The
streak often forms an arch, with the sitter's head as centre, more or less.
In respect to the arches we must regard them as being produced by some chemical.
I myself cannot conceive how the chemical could have been applied by
Mrs. Deane in such deﬁnite positions without her being discovered in the
act. Maybe the purpose of the arches is to force upon us the inference
of the presence of an invisible operator (see page 28).
As will be noted in the illustrations (Figs. 15, 16, pages 16, 17) there are
at times streaks or lines fQlowing the design ; here and there the gelatine
exhibits distinct scratches, as if abraded by the sharp edge of the chemical.
(b)
The streaks or blotches may form
a
rough design (e.g.,
a
triangle or a cross)
(Figs. 86, 87,
p.
36), the arm of Tutankhamen's chair (?)
(0)
Human faces generally surrounded with some ﬂocculent white substance
(the
“
surround")
(d) Human faces without any "surround."
(e)
Parts of, or whole human ﬁgures apparelled (Fig. 19, page 18).
Note in this ﬁgure the thin white edge, proving the ﬁgure to be
a
“
cut-out."
(f)
An unclothed baby placed on the sitter's lap. I-Iow
?
(g)
A
man's face with spectacles.
(h) The Extra appears to be held by
a
hand (Fig. 61, page 26). The illustration
is
made from the photograph untouched.
If
it
really represents
a
hand,
it
is
very interesting. It will hardly be suggested that
a
confederate was
holding the Extra.
(10)
The Extra may be duplicated on the same plate, whereas the sitter
is
not.
(k) The Extra may be symbolical. In the case illustrated Mrs. Deane remarked
to me, when asked about it, that the sitter was
a
very good man (Fig. 25,
p.
19).
2.—The “surround
”
or white cloud in which the Extra face is
embedded as a rule :—
(a) May be like cotton wool; at times threads are distinctly discernible. In
some cases at least
it
must really be cotton wool.
(b)
May be like muslin or some woven material, the loose threads of which are
clearly seen in
a
few cases.
(0)
May be exactly the same in two photographs and have a different Extra,
suggesting that the same "surround" has been used twice.
(d) In three cases the "surrounds" are nearly alike, each with
a
different
face, suggesting the use of the same
"
surround" three times and its slight
disturbance by the insertion of each face.
(e) Has in its folds at times additional faces less distinct than the main Extras."l
3.—The pictures themselves when human faces
(a) Have been recognised as likenesses of deceased persons numberless times.
Excellent instances are the Cushman photograph (329),
p.
311 and the
photograph of my cousin, John Burnside Fig. 95, page 41.
"
A
good example of this
is
the Glen Hamilton photograph containing a likeness of Sir A.
Conan Doyle and other faces. (Psychic Science, Oct. 1932.)

Page 14 Par. (1c) VARIETIES OF EXTRAS.
(b)
May be like a deceased person, but not like any existing photograph of
the deceased; e.g., the John Burnside Extra.
)
May be exactly alike with two different sitters, and in the same "surrounds."
d)
May be exactly alike with two different sitters, but in different “surrounds."
)
May be as (d) with the Extra faces of different sizes.
)
May look real, or like
a
mask cut out.
g)
May be the likeness of
a
living person.
It)
May be an exact copy of an existing photograph.
(i
May be exactly like a picture in
a
magazine or elsewhere. For instance,
the well-known coloured psychic photograph by Mrs. Deaneof a Red Indian
closely resembled,
if
it
was not exactly identical with,
a
picture on the cover
of
a
copy of My Magazine. (See
p.
24.)
(j)
The Extra may have been promised beforehand (by another medium), as in
the case of the John Burnside Extra. (See pp. 40, 41, 295 (302) and 321
(339))
(k) The shadows on the Extra may not correspond in direction with those of the
sitter.
(i)
The face may have distinct half-tone screen marks, such as are seen in
newspaper illustrations of faces.
A
number of Mrs. Deanes’ Extras have
screen marks.
,
‘I
(m) The face may have
a
straight-cut edge. In the illustration the cut
is
obvious
and
it
looks as
if
an attempt had been made to hide
it
by scratching the
gelatine.
I
ask, would Mrs. Deane, had she done this thing, have sent out
the prints
?
(n) The face or ﬁgure may have
a
narrow edge of white as
if
the cutting-out
had been done slightly faultily.
In the illustrations the cut edges of paper and the piece left at the top
of the head, also the screen marks, are so suggestive of cut-out paper that
surely Mrs. Deane, had she the consciousness of having used such cut-out
pictures, would not have put them into circulation. (See pp. 23, 296 and 300.)
(0) The same face may be broad in one Extra and narrow in another (Figs.
51, 52,
p.
23). The face in Fig. 51 can be produced from that in Fig. 52
by photographing the latter at an angle of about 45°.
4—The background
(a) Very often shows
a
coarsely woven texture over the whole plate except the
Extra and, where the Extra has been duplicated in the same photo, this
background
is
seen also over the weaker Extra, suggesting double exposure.
(See
p.
19 and Fig. 415,
p.
282.)
Sometimes the Extra records
a
shadow, thus proving its objectivity in front
of the lens. (See
p.
324.) Sometimes such an Extra
is
seen by those present.
(See pp. 322 and 323.)
(1c) Comment—From the above list one gleans that many Extras have
features which suggest the making of the Extra by normal means and afford
a
good reason for the adverse verdict on the whole matter of those who do not
pursue the subject far enough. One cannot come to any other conclusion than
that
a
proportion of these have been produced by normal means. It
is
certain
that some of the Deane Extras have been produced by placing cut-outs upon
cotton wool and photographing them together—the illustrations show
it
clearly.
Who, then, has done
it
?
Was
it
the invisible operator who, by some quality
possessed by Mrs. Deane, was able to put words and letters mentally suggested
by me on to papers and glasses with inaccessible materials and to write between
the leaves of
a
dozen sheets of paper pressed together and perform other
(continued on page 27.)

It is not known whether the sitter was the same with each pair except as regards the
Figs. 1r and 12. These appeared with the same sitter on different days. One at Mrs. Deane's
house and one at the Stead Borderland Library on a. plate supplied by the Library. Mrs.
Deane was not informed of his coming. The sitter is well known to me. The Extra has not
been recognised.

could have been applied by Mrs. Deane in such deﬁnite positions without her being dis
covered in the act. Maybe the purpose of the arches is to force upon us the inference of the
presence of an invisible operator, able on these occasions to show purposiveness and no
more. What other object could there be ?

The above two photographs were taken by Mrs. Deane at the Albert Hall on the evening
of the 8th November, 1931, at the Service of Remembrance, under the supervision of
“iss Stead, who has arranged for many years past the taking by Mrs. Deane of similar
Remembrance or Armistice Day Photographs and is therefore very experienced in the
proceedings.
Miss Stead issued a report thereon. She stated that she bought the quarter-plates at
Messrs. Boots, who had marked them for her. Miss Stead loaded the slides and retained
possession of them until they were used in the camera; the slides were never out of her
sight except when in the camera. The ﬁrst plate was exposed during the opening invocation
and the second plate was exposed during the whole time Miss Lind af Hageby was speaking.
After the exposures Miss Stead took charge of the slides and supervised the development
of them.
The face of the late Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is in the centre of the group.
The particular points to note about these photographs are that they are nearly identical
but not quite ; there is a slight diﬂerence in the surround. They suggest a carefully made
up composite picture of faces cut out and inserted in cotton wool or some similar substance.
One cannot assume that Mrs. Deane would have either the stupidity or the wickedness to
carry out such a fraud on such an occasion ; besides, it would seem that the conditions under
which these photographs were taken rule out the possibility of any such deception being
the origin of these pictures.
If we accept the genuineness of them—and the fact of their being genuine is supported
by the results of many other test sittings—the character of the pictures is very interesting
as showing at least one of the methods which can be adopted by the invisible operator.

Figs. 51 and 52 are interesting Extras. The faces are evidently the same. If the face
as it appears in Fig. 52 is photographed at an angle of about 45° the resulting picture is as
seen in Fig. 51. Notice the white margin to the face and at the top of the head. In the
original photographs the faces show screen-marks. They are both assuredly a
" cut-out."

of these Extras. Copies of existing pictures are well-known among psychic Extras. See

Concerning Figs. 59 and 60 on the page facing this.
Figs. 59 and 60 are photographs taken by Mrs. Deane at the Albert Hall Service of
Remembrance on Sunday, 10th November, 1929, under the direction of Miss Stead, whose
report is below.
(25) Comment—These photographs are very curious, the lower appearing to be a portion of
the upper. Note that the edges of the surrounds are not quite alike in each. Note the
two faces at the lower edge in Fig. 60, overhanging the margin. Those interested should
obtain original photographic prints from the Borderland Library, 5, Smith Square,
London. S.\'V.I.
Miss Slead': Report
(255) The plates used were taken from a box containing two plates. This box was specially
marked and packed with two plates inside ; the plates were also specially marked; all by
Messrs. Samuels, photographers, 150, Strand, London, “C02, for the W. T. Stead
Borderland Library.
Each slide, a single one, was loaded by Mrs. Deane in my presence on Friday,
November 8th, and was kept by me till Sunday the 10th, when I took camera and slides
to the Albert Hall. Mrs. Deane was in our box when I arrived. I handed over the camera
to her, and each slide just before the time for its exposure. I stood close beside her whilst
each photograph was being taken, and afterwards took charge of the slides until the plates
were developed in my presence at the Borderland Library. The plates bear Messrs. Samuels’
mark.
The camera was directed at the platform. The exposure was : for one of the two plates
exposed at the Service two minutes ; for the other about ten minutes.

experiments in chapter VII
?
To me these "H
8:
F" results are absolute facts. These include apported
material; and the possibility of apports must be admitted also in view of
the multitude of them reported in psychic literature. The many recognised
Deane Extras add support to the above theory of the invisible operator. That
there are recognised Extras and Extras reproducing pictures inaccessible to
the medium
(a
portrait with its frame,* for instance) must be admitted. The
operator who can put these recognised Extras (possibly using our memory plates)
and unseen pictures, can carry out the more easy task of making use of material
photographs and newspaper prints.
The only theory available
is
that the operator can take the plate to some
fourth dimension, and there carry out his work; some such method must be
employed to affect
a
middle plate of
a
packet, as in the case of Dr. Lindsay
Johnson's White Rose'l0, and in many other such cases
;
but this
is
pure theory.
The facts, however, should not be brushed aside by serious students, they are
too well authenticated.
Once admit the invisible operator and his power of producing apports, and
much
is
explained in psychic photography and many other psychic phenomena,
including some Goligher effects:

Page 28 Par. (2c) FREAK MARKINGS.
a __.___.A f --:1-1_
(2c) As regards the freakish markings
I had come to the conclusion that they originated during the development
of the plates. Many of them obviously suggest the application of chemicals;
indeed, on one occasion crystals were in evidence (see page 60), yet some may
not be due to chemicals.
The general opinion is that photographic plates are very easily affected by
chemicals and by the ﬁngers. I have not found such to be the case. I have
tried a hundred or more experiments on photographic plates with all the chemicals
in powder form and in solution, simple and in combination, the smell, colour,
and causticity, etc., of which did not exclude them from possible use by
Mrs. Deane without detection, usually mentioned in books on photography,
and have been able to produce only one or two imitations of these freak markings,
and these came up much more rapidly than Mrs. Deane's freaks appear. I have
been surprised at the difﬁculty of reducing (I do not include dissolving) the
silver salt in the gelatine by chemicals surreptitiously or by handling. This
is quite contrary to the opinion of those who have not made trials.
Had anything been sprinkled upon the plates while lying dry in the
developing dish, I had, certainly noticed the._-material on the plate, and
seen Mrs. Deane's action ; besides, chemicals act at once upon the plates being
wetted, for the moisture produces a highly concentrated solution of any soluble
chemical, whereas the freak marks are as a rule very slow in appearing. I am
at a loss to account for these marks. The developer used in my experiments
was liquid Rodinal (diluted at the time) which contains no deposit.
To produce the Deane marks by chemical means while the plate is covered
by the developer is, as far as my experiments teach me (and I have made many
such experiments), quite impossible;
if,
however, they can be so produced
it
seems to me the necessary action on the part of Mrs. Deane would surely have
been observed by me on some one occasion.
Some markings, those like snow-storms (Fig. 17, page 18), for instance, are
possibly due to undissolved developer;
I
never got them, as we used Rodinal
solution in my experiments. Yet most of the markings are, it seems most
probable, produced chemically by some chemical unrecognised by me. Again,
who did it? Had
I
not proved the existence of an invisible intelligent entity
by my other experiments,
I
should not venture to suggest that the operator did
it
by means of apported chemicals. Some of the markings do indeed show design.
as
if
an intelligence were behind them (pages 36 and 37).
I
cannot assume
deliberate fraud on Mrs. Deane's part, or lack of observation and care on
mine. However, such an explanation as
I
put forward needs much further
experimentation on the part of others to stand. That
it
will be found later
on to be the true explanation
is
deﬁnitely my opinion.
This 'operator' does not give Mrs. Deane very great consideration. She
herself has exclaimed to me that the
“
friends on
'
the other side '," as she calls
them, let her down terribly at times. Psychic literature
is
full of the pranks
of poltergeists, and we may assume the existence of
a
lack of consideration and
regard for his medium at times on the part of this particular operator.
I
obtained the assistance of
a
chemist (F.I.C., B.Sc.),
a
professional expert in
photographic chemicals. After many trials he came to the conclusion that the
only photographic chemical which would produce such Deane marks
is
amidol;
but neither he not
I
could obtain marks quite resembling Mrs. Deane's. He
found that some tin salts used in very dilute solution affect the sensitive plate
very readily. Tin salts are not used in photography, and only to a very expert
chemist would
it
occur to try salts of tin. As before stated, marks made by
chemicals come up at once on the plates, whereas Mrs. Deane's freak markings
come out late during the development of the plates, as
a
general rule.
Page 29
One morning I spoke to Mrs. Deane about the various freak marks on some
of her plates, and we had a long talk about them. She said she cannot under
stand them at all and is sure they are not due to dust in the air. When she
develops plates for other than psychic effects, such as a lot of photographs
she took of views at Southend and pictures of her own dogs, etc., she never gets
these freak marks ; and she pointed out that Mr. Hope never gets them,
although he is not a careful photographer. She remarked that the freaks were
not due to inexperience or carelessness, as they did not come on her plates while
she was a beginner, and was working under worse conditions, but only latterly.
She stated she considered her photographic powers were given her to produce
portraits to comfort sitters, and she added that freaks generally came on plates
exposed on experimenters like myself. (I ﬁnd, however, some freakish marks
on plates with Miss Stead as sitter.)
As regards the effect of touching the sensitive side of photographic plates, I
took two Marion Brilliant quarter-plates, and Mrs. Deane pressed with her
index ﬁnger two diagonals on the sensitive side of one plate, and with the
middle ﬁnger two diagonals on the sensitive side of the other plate. The
second pressure was as much as the plate would stand without breaking. The
plates were dry and Mrs. Deane's ﬁngers were dry. J developed the plates
at home afterwards and there was no trace at all of any pressure. The plates,
after hypo-ing, were perfectly blank. (See also (144) page 55.)
A moist ﬁnger will leave a ﬁnger mark on a dry or damp plate, but will not
affect the silver. I have also rubbed my ﬁnger numberless times on plates when
wet with Rodinal with the object of affecting the silver, but never had any result.
The hard pressure of a lead pencil point will indeed act on the emulsion.
Further as regards the freakish marks, see chapter IV.
Mrs. Deane does not pretend to know more concerning the origin and nature
of the extras than other people. As a great number of faces have been
recognised as those of deceased persons, she draws the natural conclusion that
they emanate from the
“
other side," a conclusion which is shared with her
by very many highly intellectual persons. That these photographs are abnormal
is a fact ; whence they come is a matter of opinion. If sitters accept them as
of spirit origin, that is their affair. Mrs. Deane does not know them not to be so.
She never tries to inﬂuence sitters in this matter.
Latterly Mrs. Deane's camera and slides are left at the
"
Borderland
Library" (conducted by Miss E. W. Stead, 5, Smith Square, London, S.W.l)
where any interested person can examine them. The plates are supplied to
Miss S. and marked by a ﬁrm of photographers who make packets of pairs
of plates and seal each packet. The packets are taken charge of by a
"
Borderland Library" official. Each packet is handed to the medium by a
“Borderland Library" official in the presence of the client, and the client
(or party of persons) sees the whole proceeding and is permitted to watch the
development of the plates. Yet since these conditions were inaugurated there
has been no falling off in the appearance of Extras, nor in recognitions.
In support of my observations in defence of Mrs. Deane's power I would
refer the reader especially to Miss Stead's book—Faces of the Living Dead-—
which includes testimony (on p. 77) of Mr. Lingwood-Smith, Criminal Identiﬁ
cation Ofﬁcer and expert photographer, and (on pp. 63 ct seq) particulars of
the Cushman Extra. See also on p. 40 herein report of the John Burnside Extra
and on p. 310 the account of Mrs. Deane's visit to Birmingham, etc., etc.
CHAPTER III.
Experiments with pholograp/n'c plates
exposed in a camera.
My systematic experiments with Mrs. Deane, with photographic plates
exposed in a camera, began on January lst, 1923, and continued, approximately,
weekly for one-and-a-half years. Mrs. Deane exposed 300 plates upon me
through my camera. (See Appendix p. 284.)
I determined that throughout the new series of experiments the conditions ‘
should be such as to eliminate all possibility of fraud.
The number of the experiments was such as to exclude the objection that
the results obtained could be attributed to faulty plates and such as to give
me ample opportunity for the detection of trickery.
I made it an invariable rule to take notes at the sittings, and to write these
up into the form of a report the same evening or the next. In these reports
I made a point of setting down everything ob:i;rved, even to small details that
might appear irrelevant.
'
The following notes are extracted from my full reports. I always took my
own camera to the sitting with me, with my own slides, and carried both away
with me. The exposed plates had, in nearly every case, been left with Mrs. Deane
for a few days in a packet carefully sealed up by me in such a way that it could
not be opened without detection.
In this I had the help of a friend, a pharmaceutical chemist, Mr. Tree, who
initialled and numbered the plates before they were done up.
The method I used for securing the packet of plates was, in nearly every
case, a piece of strong gummed brown paper tape, about l-in. wide, over the
lap of which I placed a label made of wafer paper (such as one ﬁnds on the
under-surface of macaroons). This wafer paper had a special design printed
upon it with printer's ink at my establishment, and, in addition, a special
rubber stamp impression made upon it whilst moist. The wafer paper was
thoroughly damped and pressed on and was concealed by a brown paper covering
gummed over it. Wafer paper is of such a nature that it cannot be removed
when dry without breaking
(it
is
extremely brittle), and when moistened or
steamed becomes so pappy that
it
has no cohesion.
This method of sealing is,
I
think, quite efﬁcacious.
The packets were opened, after careful examination by me, in the dark-room
with
a
knife-cut in such
a
way as not to damage the sealing. The wrappings
were put by me in my pocket and taken to my office, and were examined by
myself and Mr. Tree. We never found any tampered with.
Either
I
loaded the slides or Mrs. Deane did so under my close supervision.
(2d) It
is
a
remarkable thing that not on a single one of these 300 plates, thus
securely fastened, did any face appear as Extra. A great number of them,
perhaps half, bore freakish marks of one kind or another, which
I
have come to
think were produced by the ooperator' during development.
Sometimes during the course of these experiments, when
I
had not sealed
the packets, an Extra face has come. The less the obstruction the better the
result. The less the obstruction the weaker the evidence. But obstruction
may be
a
hindrance even to the 0operator'
if
such there be.
On several occasions
a
ﬁlm was exposed in another camera at the same time
as a plate. Sometimes freak marks have appeared upon each, but never were
these marks alike.
Page 30
CAMERA WORK. Page 31
It will obviously occur to many (those without experience of psychic
possibilities) that the precautions taken by me to prevent the opening of the
packets left with Mrs. Deane, prevented her from manipulating the plates, and
that the freakish markings which appeared were caused by the deft application
of chemicals.
It is often said that the mere touch of the sensitive ﬁlm of the photographic
plate by the ﬁngers will affect the silver salt, but I have not found that to be
the case. I have dealt with this matter in chapter II, page 28.
But the obvious explanation may not be the correct one; the vagaries of
psychic phenomena are a commonplace with workers in this ﬁeld. My critical
detective attitude may have been the inhibitory factor. There may have been
a subconscious resentment on Mrs. Deane's part to my constant precautions.
It is a fact, which is admitted by all experimenters in this domain, that
suspicion on the part of a sitter does spoil results.
As regards the freakish marks, seeing that I was undertaking this work
with a view to discover whether the phenomena were genuine, it is highly
improbable that during the development of four hundred plates (including the
skotographs), I should have been so blind that Mrs. Deane should have
been able to delude my senses during the whole time. All the plates were
developed under my eyes in quite sufﬁcient light to see' what went on and, as I
say, I was as observant as I could possibly be. I am not likely to have let
Mrs. Deane rub her ﬁngers on the plates or touch the surface of them with an
instrument such as a brush.
Nevertheless, my opinion is that many, if not all, of these freak marks were
produced by the action of some chemical ; how applied I know not (see page 28).
Many of the freakish marks show evidence of scratches on the gelatine, one
or more scratches running along the peculiar freaks; not in the majority of
them, but in some of them, as if some material had been applied to the plate ;
and I have observed these scratches in cases where I am absolutely certain
Mrs. Deane did not touch the sensitive surface of the plate; sometimes the
streaks show an abrasion down to the glass.
The late Sir A. Conan Doyle and many others obtained such freak marks
(see pp. 16 and 17), among them a Mr. Young, a photographer, who marked
his plates by a secret exposure and thus knew there was no substitution of
plates. He wrote: "My experiment was conducted in such a manner that
I am satisﬁed that no trickery was resorted to in any other way." His plates
showed large freak marks. (Light 1922, p. 517.)
It must be borne in mind that among these freaks are many which, it is
obvious, could not have been produced by Mrs. Deane, however skilled she may
be in legerdemain (which, of course, she is not), without her act being detected.
How, then, to account for the application of chemicals?
If an invisible operator can do the things recorded in chapter VII, using
material not present wherewith to write, it can also mark photographic plates
with
“
apported
"
suitable material. The reader must form his own judgment
from the facts given by me.
Mrs. Deane informed me that she was told clairaudiently that the operating
intelligence wanted to give me something special, which indeed was done later.
Whatever the object of the intelligence may have been): the result was in
accordance with my wishes, for, had I obtained faces only, I should have got no
forwarder, whereas the result of the freakish marks appearing was in time to
force the idea into my head that the freakish marks appeared only during
development because they were produced there by Mrs. Deane's inﬂuence during
development, and this observation led me to start my (in my view, valuable)
H and F experiments (see chapter VII).
*Some students of the subject may think the object was to draw my attention to the
presence of the outside operator.
Page 32 Figs. 67 to 70 CAMERA WORK.
Now I will deal with the few illustrations of the freak Extras which appeared
on the plates exposed in my camera upon me by Mrs. Deane, and which are of
more interest than the others. The majority of the latter consist of indeﬁnite
little ovals and indeﬁnite markings.
A few of the freaks give one the impression that some design has been
executed by an unskilled hand under difﬁculties.
The illustrations are printed from half-tone blocks. The screen marks on
such blocks are a drawback, especially in preventing examination by a lens.
A direct print off any one of the quarter-plate negatives will be supplied by
the author, post free, for 6d. each, subject to such being available.

Fig. 81 is curious. A freakish arm seems to hold a hand over my face. The hand is
seen more clearly in the more darkly printed inset. It reminds me of a remark made by one
'bus driver (in the horse-'bus days) to another, when jammed in Cheapside opposite the
other, equally jammed, telling him to drive on, "For" said he, "your face annoys me."
This interpretation too is in keeping with what was passing in my mind at the time.
A Kodak ﬁlm exposed at the same time developed out perfectly normal, without any
extra mark.
Figs. So, 81, S3 and 85 are indeﬁnite freaks, which came on plates under good conditions
of control.

Page 36 Figs. 86 to 89 CAMERA WORK.
Fig. 88
Figs. 86, 87, 88, and 89 are interesting, as the designs of the freaks were
promised at Deane séances which I attended, held a few days previous to each
of the four morning sittings, when the above plates were used.
Fig. 86 shows a triangle on my head; it was obtained under good test
conditions on March 12th, 1923. (See p. 39.)
At the Deane séance held a week previously, which I attended, and which
was recorded by me the same evening as the séance was held (these séances were
held weekly, and I rarely missed one), a control,
“
Hulah," spoke through
Mrs. Deane and chaffed me about my bald head. I suggested she should use
it for drawing something on at my next sitting for photographs. She con
curred, and asked what she should put. I replied, "Something simple, a
triangle or a square."
CAMERA WORK. Fig. 90 Page 37
As a sample of the method adopted by me in recording these photographic
sittings, and to show the impossibility of Mrs. Deane having put this triangle
upon the plate by normal means, I give below (page 39) a detailed account of
the sitting of March 12th, 1923, when the triangle appeared.
Fig. 88, page 36, shows a crescent (enlarged X 4 linear), which is over
my right shoulder. At the Deane evening séance held previously to this sitting,
and which I attended,
"
Hulah
"
promised to put a crescent on my photograph
(see (215) page 225).
This séance was recorded by me the same evening as the séance was held.
Fig. 87, page 36, shows a cross.
At the previous séance the control
“
Hulah
"
promised me to try to put a
cross on one of the plates of the next sitting for photographs (see (220) page 227).
This séance was recorded by me the same evening as the séance was held.
At the subsequent séance
"
Hulah
”
spoke of the cross, and alluded to an
attempt she had made to put a parrot on my shoulder as well. Possibly the
other freakish mark represents her attempt at a parrot.

presence) instead of me.

had, at the previous séance, promised to
try writing, but was not enthusiastic about it. The result was not a success.
March 17th, 1924 (Fig. 90). On one of four plates exposed to-day upon my
cousin, Miss E. B., in my presence, some parallel bands appeared (Fig. 90).
This is the ﬁrst and only time parallel bands have
appeared. It is a curious thing that at a séance
held ten days previously in the evening, I had
made some experiments with Mrs. Deane with
several strips of paper covered with luminous
paint, ﬁxed parallel to one another with dark
spaces between, which Mrs. Deane gazed at with
the idea of transferring the picture to the photo
graphic plate with which I was experimenting at
that séance. These parallel bands on the Extra Fig- 90
today remind me of this experiment.
january I4th, 1924 (Fig. 92, page 38). My cousin, Miss E. B., was the sitter in
my presence. The packet containing this plate had been left with Mrs. Deane,
but sealed in such a way that I am conﬁdent it was not opened. The developing
was carried out by Mrs. Deane and myself. I watched very carefully, and I
cannot account for the very peculiar markings which came upon this plate.
I suppose such markings could be produced by some chemicals, but I have not
succeeded in making anything like them; and if I did know what chemical
to use to make such markings, I am conﬁdent such chemical could not be used
without my observing
it,
for
it
is
not
a
slight patch of freakish markings.
I
am
conﬁdent liquid could not have been squirted on to the plate without my seeing
the action. During the development my eyes were riveted on the plates.
Another plate (not illustrated) developed at the same time, bore similar
extensive marks.
july 3rd, 1924.—On this particular occasion, in addition to my own camera
and slides,
I
brought
a
Kodak roll camera ﬁtted with a small roll ﬁlm, and
asked Mrs. Deane to permit me to place that alongside the other. Four
exposures of the roll ﬁlm were taken synchronously with the four plates.
Three of the quarter-plates had markings of the usual character, of which one
is
Fig. 71, (illustrated on page 33). Of the roll-ﬁlm exposures only two had
any Extras at all, one very faint shadowy clouds, the other one of the usual
spots. Neither of them similar to the markings on the glass plates exposed at
the same time.

said she saw a beautiful light spreading from my left shoulder in the form of an
arch to the ﬂowers which were in vases on the table opposite me. On developing,
my ﬁgure came out ﬁrst, and only after some time did any Extra appear. On
this, the third plate of four, there was a streak (seen in the illustration) from my
left shoulder over my head to the ﬂowers, forming a kind of arch.

Report of sitting with Ms. Deane of Monday, March 12th, 1923.
My dark slides Nos. 1-4, containing plates marked by Mr. Tree, Nos. 261/I, 262/II,
263/111, 264/IV, were left with Mrs. Deane on Friday evening, March 9th.
They were tied up with string, and fastened with wafer paper, covered over with silk
glaze paper. They were stamped with my rubber stamp in such a way that they could not
be opened, or dealt with without detection. The packet was then wrapped in brown paper
with a fancy gummed tape
"
Season0s Greetings," and the ends were fastened over with a
label printed by myself.
I
cut the gummed tape, and withdrew the inner parcel.
I
cut the
string in two places, as
I
could not draw the slides out otherwise. The wrappings
I
put in my
pocket.
I
then took charge of the slides.
Soon after opening the parcel, the slides were placed between Mrs. Deane's hands and
mine
;
Mrs. Deane said a prayer and sang
a
hymn.
I
then asked Mrs. Deane to take a photo
graph of me, using the camera
I
had brought with me, and which
I
never leave behind me.
Having taken my seat upon the chair, in front of Mrs. Deane's curtain, which
I
did not
remove (on each previous occasion since
I
introduced the cabinet,
I
have removed the
curtain, but did not do so to-day). The plates in slides Nos.
I
and
2
were exposed about
one-and-a-half minutes. Then Nos.
3
and
4
were placed in the camera.
I
had provided
myself with a piece of blue glass, specially supplied as a colour-ﬁlter for the three-colour
process. While exposing plates in slides, Nos.
3
and 4, Mrs. Deane held this piece of glass
in front of the lens the whole time. To each of these she gave an exposure of over two
minutes.
I
personally withdrew slide
3
and
4
from the camera, as Mrs. Deane found it
very stiff, and put
it
with the other carrier into my pocket.
We then descended into the dark-room (the larder).

took upstairs to a tap and washed. Mrs. Deane having lit the lamp, we
proceeded to develop.
I
personally withdrew the plates from the slides, and dipped each one
into a basin of water, to moisten the gelatine, and then placed it, face upwards, in the dish.
The plates were thus placed alongside one another during this process. Mrs. Deane did not
touch them or put her hand over the dish
;
all she did was to pour the developing solution
over them. After rocking the dish for a little time, the plates were put in the hypo. in my
presence by Mrs. Deane—all under my careful supervision. It was impossible for anything
to be done during the process without my knowledge. We left the larder together, and
left the plates in the Hypo from ten to ﬁfteen minutes.
Result
:
On one of the plates appeared some of those peculiar oval markings with trails,
such as have appeared on my plates before, and which
I
notice upon many Deane photo
graphs. On plate No. 264, round my head
is
a roughly drawn triangle. Now, it
is
very
curious, but, at the séance on Wednesday last, an entity, said to be
" Hulah," made allusion
to my bald head, and
I
remarked that
it
was suitable for inscriptions
;
I
asked the entity
to use it for that purpose, and the ﬁrst thing
I
suggested should be written thereon was a
triangle
;
I
said
" Draw a triangle or square." This
is
in the report of the Wednesday's séance.

(2c) The john Burnside Photograph.
The following particulars refer to an Extra obtained through Mrs. Deane
of my late cousin, John Burnside, at one of my morning sittings with her.
John Burnside died in the year 1907.
John Burnside was at one time Headmaster of a small Grammar School at
Wymondham, near Norwich. There is no photograph of him in existence
exactly similar to the Extra.
With these few facts noted, I will proceed with the history of the photograph.
On the 2lst October, 1925, I accompanied my brother and cousin,
Miss E. Burnside, to a private sitting with the Misses Moore, sensitives for
"direct voice" phenomena. As usual we sat in total darkness, with a trumpet
placed in the centre of the circle. The weather was very wet and the atmosphere
close. The window was open. The conditions were therefore very bad.
The voices of the controls, Koha and Andrew, came through very weak
indeed. Then a voice came to my brother and gave the name of Ellen (our
mother's Christian name) and called out my brother's Christian name (George)
and then my own. The voice said :
"
George, speak to me."
Later a voice (unrecognised) came to BB. and said:
"
John." E.B. said:
"Are you Jack!" Reply:
“
Yes." “What are you doing on the other
side?" asked EB. “
Chemistry," said the voice. Chemistry was not his
subject on this side, but it is mine. The voice then added:
"
If you have a
photograph taken I will try to be there.“
Now EB. had sat with me many times at Mrs. Deane's, some six months
before, obtaining only one face Extra, and there was no intention of her resuming
sittings with Mrs. Deane. EB. had sat once before with me at a group séance
with the Misses Moore.
On account of the message received by EB. from the voice
“
John," it was
arranged that E.B. should accompany me on 29th October to Mrs. Deane's.
On 22nd October I left a broken packet of quarter-plates with Mrs. Deane, not
secured in any particular manner. I told Mrs. Deane about our sitting at the
Stead Bureau, and that E.B.’s brother had promised to try to come. As
Mrs. Deane could not procure a likeness of the departed Jack (his widow and
family have emigrated) nor E.B.’s address, and as I possess no portrait of E.B.’s
brother, I decided to be perfectly open with Mrs. Deane and avoid every vestige
of secrecy; therefore I took no precaution with the packing of the plates, and
told Mrs. Deane what E.B. was hoping for.
EB. and I visited Mrs. Deane on October 29th. Four plates were exposed;
on the ﬁrst plate appeared an Extra upside-down, which I recognised as that
of E.B.’s brother, (Fig. 95, page 41).
In the eyes of his widow, his sister and a cousin (Miss C.) the likeness is
certainly that of J.B. Mrs. J. Burnside wrote me from South Africa :
"
With
reference to the man's face in the 0woolly' surround in proximity to that of
my sister-in-law, it is an unmistakable representation of my late husband."1L
o Extras have been foretold in the same manner to other sitters ; such cases are reported
in Light—1919 p. 390, 1921 p. 90, 1922 p. 665, 1925 p. 269, 1933 p. 307.
1' Mr. David Gow in
'
Rays and Reﬂections
'
in Light, March 3rd, 1933, wrote with reference
to recognitions in psychic photography :
"
some Extras are so clear and deﬁnite as to be
unmistakable portraits, and this has happened in cases where the sitter is a complete
stranger to the medium." Sre also (330) p. 312.
BURNSlDE EXTRA. Fig. 95 Page 41
A Miss E. L. Burt wrote to BB. from Staneway, Rayne, Braintree :
"
With
reference to the photograph you showed me the last time I came to see you,
I should certainly say the likeness was of your brother Jack. It was so
wonderfully clear I felt quite convinced it was his real picture."
Not satisﬁed with the recognitions of
relatives and friends, upon which doubt is
so often cast by sceptics, I obtained the help
of a pharmacist, Mr. Tree, unrelated to the
Burnside family and myself. We picked
out from a trade directory the name of
a chemist (Mr. J. F. Collin) at Wymondham,
near Norwich, at which place John Burnside
had been a schoolmaster twenty-ﬁve to thirty
years before. Mr. Tree, basing his application
upon the fellowship of the craft, sent a print
of the J.B. Extra, cut away from the sitter,
to the chemist at Wymondham, telling him
he was informed that it was the likeness of a
gentleman who lived at Wymondham twenty- Fig- 95
ﬁve to thirty years ago, and requesting the chemist to make enquiries of some of
the older inhabitants whether they could recognise and name it. Mr. Tree
wrote from his home address.
The manager of the business (Mr. J. Jenkins) answered Mr. Tree's letter and
said he would do his best. He then wrote that many recognised the portrait
but could not name it, but one gentleman thought he had been a schoolmaster
in the place. Mr. Tree replied to that, and told the manager that the subject
of the photograph had been a schoolmaster at Wymondham. A letter then
came from the manager (Mr. Jenkins) stating that the portrait had been
recognised as that of Mr. Burnside.
Extract from a letter dated December 8th, 1926, addressed to Mr. John Tree
by Mr. J. Jenkins, manager at Mr. J. F. Collin's pharmacy at Wymondham,
near Norwich :—
"
Without the slightest doubt the photograph is that of Mr. John Burnside.
People differ as regards the time he lived at Wymondham, varying from twenty
ﬁve to thirty years. A Mr. Chamberlain was the ﬁrst to recognise the photograph,
and said it was Mr. Burnside ; then a Mr. Clements. who showed me
Mr. Burnside's photograph in a school group,* then Mr. Nichols, who was the
sports teacher at the school in Mr. Burnside's time, recognised it at once. I was
at a bazaar a fortnight ago and the Rev. E. R. asked for the photograph. He
showed it to a Mrs. Taylor, and asked her who it was, and she said at once,
'That is Mr. Burnside.' At least four people, as mentioned, perhaps more,
recognised the photograph, having no idea who it was; others recalled him
after having been told.
Yours faithfully, J. JENKINS,"
"I certify that the facts mentioned, concerning Mr. Jenkins and myself,
are as stated.—-John Tree
"
(August, 1927).
To omit no single fact in this case: my cousin E.B. remarked to me,
“
It is
not surprising Jack should come in view of your connection with his family since
his death."
oI have seen this group photograph. The Extra is not a copy from this. It was
suggested to me by a serious psychic researcher that Mrs. Deane went to “0ymondham
and copied the Extra from the group photograph, she being quite unaware of its existence
or that ].1%. ever was at \Vymondham. F.“V.“V.
Page 42 Pars. (2f) to (21') CAMERA WORK.
,A special sitting held at my warehouse in I922.
(2f) In 1922 a test sitting was arranged to take place on a Saturday afternoon
at my business premises. There were several friends of mine present, in addition
to Mrs. Deane and her daughter, Miss V. Deane. Chief among my visitors was
a friend from Amsterdam, a Mr. V. (son of an old school-fellow), an amateur
photographer, and at one time President of an Amateur Photographic Society
of his native town. About a dozen plates were exposed. New unopened
packets of plates and my camera and my slides appertaining thereto were
used. The plates were initialled by one of us before insertion in my slides.
The development of the plates was carried out in a dark-room on my premises
by Mrs. Deane, under the supervision of Mr. V., very experienced in photography,
as already noted. In view of the object of the experiments, viz. : a test of
Mrs. Deane's power, my friend, Mr. V., kept close watch for any manipulation
or trickery. He was a disbeliever in psychic photography. The chemical
solutions were prepared by a qualiﬁed chemist in my employment, well up in
photography ; he vouches for the clarity of the solutions ; also for the cleanliness
of the dishes which were provided by me.
(28) The marks seen in the illustration (Fig.95A, p. 43) are not to be accounted
for by faults in the plates or in the developer used ; and that Mrs. Deane could
have operated upon nine of the plates without'being observed doing it, when
her hands were under close observation with the object of detecting trickery,
is surely out of the question. The marks suggest the action of a chemical.
Points to be noted about these peculiar marks are : some small ovals such
as are to be found in many of Mrs. Deane's freak Extras (seen much better in the
photographic prints) ; the arch between the two sitters in No. 4 ; the half-arch
in No. 6 (such arches are not unusual in psychic photographs (see pages 16 and
17) ; and the possible connection of Nos. 2 and 9 with records in the mind or
minds of one or more of the company present.
In view of my later experiences with Mrs. Deane, proving her power of
thought-reading and direct writing, and the strange results obtained with her
on others of my photographic plates, I am inclined to the opinion that it is not
unlikely that the following facts may have been the stimuli of the two fantastic
marks numbers 2 and 9.
(2h) As regards No. 2, the picture in the middle of the top row: some years ago
I took my young Dutch friend to see the pantomine,
“
Hop 0' My Thumb,"
at Drury Lane. A very amusing feature of this pantomime was a scarecrow,
occupying a prominent place in one of the scenes. Later on it came to life
and was vitalised by George Graves, who carried on a lively reminiscent con-
versation with a fellow comedian reclining on a bank in
“
Love Lane "—“ Do
you remember?
"
asked the one constantly, and the other replied repeatedly,
“
Happy Days, Happy Days." We were all most tickled with this amusing
scene. Now, my young friend visits London yearly on business, and it has been
his habit ever since to greet me on each occasion with the words,
“
Happy
Days, Happy Days," instead of the usual greeting; such an impression did
the pantomine episode make upon him. In view of the mind-reading results
of my later experiments, I am inclined to think that the ﬁgure in the middle
photograph of the top row is an attempt to represent a scarecrow.
(2i) As regards the photograph in the bottom right hand corner (No. 9), the
sitter against whose head appears an abnormal mark, was another Dutchman,
a stranger brought by Mr. V. During the afternoon one of the ladies of the
party, a Germanophobe, expressed to me her antipathy to this particular
gentleman on account of his German characteristics. Is the mark, which looks
like a lady's boot kicking the gentleman's head, a symbolical representation of
the feeling expressed P

Page 44 Par. (21:) CHAPTER III.
Deane-Warrick Psychic Exlra, No. 499.* (Fig. ()7).
(2);) I offer no opinion on the following facts, and base no conclusion upon them.
I report things just as they happened. _
The photograph (Fig. 97) on the other side was taken of me by Mrs. Deane on
November 5th, 1923. The plate used was not controlled. There is a feature
about it which may be only one of chance's strange freaks. Most probably it is.
A peculiarity I fancied I saw in the forehead of the Extra led me to have it
enlarged and to examine round about the eye with strong lenses ; one lens marked
X 10 and another with the mark X 20.
While wandering over the right eye with my lenses, I was astonished to see
what appeared to me to be theiface of my late father in the right pupil (to
the viewer's left). It has certain characteristics about it which, to my eye,
form the main features of a composite picture I have of him in my mind.
A certain expression of the mouth, which is strangely reminiscent of him, (Fig. 96)
It will be said that the face is not easily discernible as a face, but it seems
to me there must be more in it than that. I will therefore state simply and
truly what happened.
.
(1) First of all, there is the fact that I immediately recognised this face as
that of my late father. _
-
(2) I was at my ofﬁce examining it, and I timed round to the clerk behind
me, who at that time helped me with my photographs, and said,
"
Do you want
to see a photograph of my late father ?
"
She looked at it and said,
"
That is
you, Mr. Warrick
"
(I have been told I have grown to look like my father).
She had never seen my father.
(3) A few days after that I visited my brother. I had had the eye,
meantime, further enlarged by photography. I showed it to him and said,
"Here is the latest photograph of myself." He remarked,
“
That is not you,
that is the pater." I wrote to him a few days afterwards and asked him to
conﬁrm our conversation about this photograph. He wrote as follows :—
"
I presume you will be in no hurry for the certiﬁcate about the photograph,
so will you let me see it again? I should like to be very clear and certain about
it to make my testimony of value."
He thereafter wrote :—" You handed me on Sunday morning. at Welling,
a photograph, saying, 0Here is a photograph of myself.' I glanced at it and
replied,
'
It is the pater.' I saw the face without any hesitation, and recognised
the peculiar expression, which makes it, to me, an unmistakable likeness."
(4) I showed it to my nephew, Edward W., with the question, “Who is
this?" The answer came "pat," "Grandfather Warrick." He wrote me,
in answer to my request, a note, in which he states,
"
I can certainly bear out
what you say, that I had not the slightest hesitation at all that the likeness in
question was that of my grandfather. Until the moment you showed me the
photograph I had not heard of it from anyone."
(5) I showed the photograph to my second-cousin, Miss N .C., who knew
my father. I put the photograph before her as one of myself. Her remark
was,
"
No, it is not you, it is Uncle Robert."
(6) I showed the photograph, without any suggesting, to a cousin (M.M.W.)
who knew my father very well. She said, and wrote later, "That photograph
you showed me the other night is most absurdly like Uncle R."
(7) I handed the photograph to my niece (B.D.L.), saying it was a photo
graph of myself. Miss B.D.L. said,
"
It is much more like grandfather."
(8) I sent the enlargement to a gentleman (J.H.) who knew my father
many years ago. His observation was, that while he did not remember my
father well enough to recognise it, the face certainly had the Warrick
characteristics.

06 Fig- 9."
(9) My father's late clerk recognised
it
as resembling my father.
(10)
I
sent the enlarged photograph to
a
commercial artist, with instructions
to make an enlarged drawing of what he saw. This he did, and caught the
expression so well that when
I
received
it
and was examining it in
a
good
light at my office, my nephew, Edward \V., happening to pass by, said,
"
There
is
no necessity to ask who that is." In answer to the questionI put to
him, to make quite sure, he said,
“
Of course,
it
is
my late grandfather."
We have here, therefore, the testimony of an outsider,
a
commercial artist,
who sees so truly what
I
see, that his drawing
is
immediately recognised by
a
relative.
Probably this has no bearing upon the subject, but
it
is
another strange
thing, and a curious coincidence, that just at the very time
I
discovered this
resemblance in the eye of the Extra,
I
came across
a
daily newspaper giving
a
reproduction of a photograph showing the photographer reﬂected in the eye
of the animal which he was photographing.
(11)
I
consulted
a
photographer in a large way of business, and he wrote
me as follows: “I am a very experienced photographer, and have pleasure
in stating that the enlargement within the circle marked ,R.B.W. shows
distinctly to me the face of
a
bearded man, and that in my eyes
it
bears some
resemblance to yourself [this latter observation without any suggestion from
me,] Signed G.D."
(I2)
I
submitted the photograph to
a
photo-microscopist, Mr. A. W. Dennis,
for further enlargement. On meeting him thereafter,
I
asked him whether he
saw a portrait representing the head of
a
man in the enlargement he had made.
He said,
"
Certainly, there
is
no doubt about it," and, added
"
It
is
like you,
Mr. Warrick."
I
said
I
had friends who could not see
a
face in
it
at all.
“
Well."
he said,
"
I
cannot understand that these people cannot see anything."
Mr. Dennis takes no interest in psychic photography, and
is
a
total disbeliever
in it.
One critic of psychic phenomena remarked to me that
if
my father wished to
give me his picture he would not have hidden
it
away in the eye of an Extra.
Truly
a
reasonable remark, with which
I
cannot but agree. But psychic facts
are notably bizarre, so, as
a
recorder of facts,
I
let the report stand.
CHAPTER IV.
Some results obtained on plates not exposed
in a camera (skotograph:
It was my habit at times to take with me in my pocket to the morning
sittings, and to the séances, without notice to Mrs. Deane or anyone else, one
or more quarter-plates for various experiments. Many freakish results were
obtained; not surface marks, but reductions of the silver. These results I
call
“
U's
”
(Unexposed).
Of 105
“
unexposed" plates experimented with in this series under various
conditions, some 75% show marks, the origin of which I cannot account for.
What I have to say generally about the nature of such freakish markings,
will be found in chapter II, page 28, and my remarks there printed should be
referred to in connection with the reports in this chapter.
During these unexposed plates experiments I observed most carefully all
the processes, and I am convinced nothing tricky was done to the plates by
Mrs. Deane and, as explained in chapter II, I have been unable to produce
such marks by means of chemicals under conditions at all similar to those
of the experiments.
The results, about 75, will, I fear, not interest the reader, who was not
present and cannot share my conviction that they were not produced by
accidental or purposeful application of chemicals. However, I put a few of
the experiments on record. The designs which appeared on photographic
plates during my H 8: F experiments, described on page 55 et seq., are in
a different category and will, I think, repay the reader's attention as showing
the action of some invisible operator. If there is such an invisible operator
he may well have made the chemical freak-marks.
Considerations of space and expense have restricted me to a small selection
from the positive results which I have obtained. The examples illustrated
will furnish some idea of the character of these marks.
I will proceed to give, condensed from my ’contemporary notes, the
circumstances attending the appearance of them. Unless otherwise stated,
these
"
U
"
plates were experimented with at morning sittings after Mrs. Deane
had exposed plates upon me in my camera, or made other experiments.
U/1.—The ﬁrst of these experiments made by me with unexposed plates was at
a séance at Mrs. Deane's on May 31st, 1923. It was a surprise experiment.
I brought a quarter-plate with me in a box. I suggested to the circle we should
hold the box in our hands. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Deane placed her
hands ﬁrst, above and below it. I followed, and after me the others. We held
the box thus for about seven minutes. Before we took our hands away,
Mrs. Deane had gone into a trance, and spoken as Brown Wolf. He said
nothing particular. She then woke up.
Page 46'
SKOTOGRAPHS. Figs. 103 and 104 Page 47
I took charge of the unopened box, and Mrs. Deane and I adjourned to the
dark-room. We developed the half-plates used for recording the table-risings,
and then this quarter-plate. A peculiar large mark appeared upon the plate.
Mrs. Deane had no opportunity of touching the plate. The same developer
was used for the half-plates; nothing abnormal appeared upon them. It was
a surprise experiment, and Mrs. Deane had no opportunity to prepare anything
to make such a mark as appeared.
This peculiar freak showed blacker on the side of the gelatine touching the
glass than on the side of the gelatine in contact with the air. This has happened
several times in the case of freaks appearing on my plates, suggesting that the
action on the silver has taken place from the glass side of the gelatine ﬁlm,
therefore not by means of a chemical.
U/4 july, 1923.—The plate for this I took with me to a morning sitting at
Mrs. Deane's. After Mrs. Deane and I had developed four plates which she had
exposed upon me, the developer was poured back into the tumbler from the
dish and, the plates being removed, the dish was left empty. I placed the U/4
plate myself in the centre of the dish, Mrs. Deane not touching it. Until I pro
duced the packet she knew nothing of my project. Mrs. Deane poured on the
liquid Rodinal, and I kept my eyes on the plate and dish the whole time.
The crossed lines in the illustration came up (Fig. 103).
Fig. 104
11/9 was treated similarly. Result (Fig. 104X2 linear).
U/IL—This skotograph was obtained at an evening séance at Mrs. Deane's.
Towards the end of the séance I took from my pocket, quite unexpectedly to the
circle, a cardboard box containing a quarter-plate. I took the lid off and left
the plate in the bottom of the box. I then asked the circle to put their hands
above and below the box. Mrs. Deane put her hands, ﬁrst one above and one
below the box; the others followed suit, and I put mine outside the lot.
It must be remembered that the introduction of this experiment was a
surprise. No plate, with the lid off the box, had been experimented with by
me at a séance before.
Page 48 Figs. 105 and 106 Par. (3) SKOTOGRAPHS.
Mrs. Deane and I adjourned to the dark-room, where we developed ﬁve half
plates we had exposed for photographs of levitations obtained that evening.
After removing some only of the half-plates I placed in the developer the
quarter-plate which had been under our hands; curious streaks and spots
came up (Fig. 105) which are similar to many obtained on Mrs. Deane's Extras.
There is not a vestige of such streaks and spots on the ﬁve half-plates developed
in the same solution. I was present the whole time of developing, and I could
detect nothing being done to the plate.
Fig. 105 Fig. 106
U/17.—This is another example of a curious
“
Skotograph
"
obtained by me
with Mrs. Deane (Fig. 106X2§ linear).
(3) U/34. january 161h, 1924.*During the evening séance in the dark, this
day, I placed a cardboard box with a quarter-plate in it on the table. We did
not put our hands upon it. I took this away with me in the box without
opening it. On developing the plate at my rooms, it showed three faint, largish
marks (the silver salt is deﬁnitely reduced); this is interesting, as the box
was not opened at the sitting.
U/40, March 3rd, 1924.—After developing some quarter-plates which had
been exposed upon me, I took a box from my pocket which contained a quarter-
plate marked U/40 and put it in the Rodinal solution ; nothing came upon it.
I then placed it on Mrs. Deane's left hand, sensitive side upwards, and
Mrs. Deane held her right hand over it, so that her ﬁngers were about three
quarters of an inch from the plate. Almost immediately a large black patch
showed itself under the ﬁngers. The plate was put back into the bath, but
nothing more came. The experiment was repeated, Mrs. Deane holding the
ﬁngers of her right hand over the blank space of the plate. Again something
appeared ; smaller this time. The experiment was repeated for a third time ;
nothing further happened until the plate was returned to the bath, when further
markings came up. One of the marks is 2l-in.Xl-in. ; the silver is deﬁnitely
reduced. The plate shows no scratches or other indication of the action of a
chemical.
U/39, U/41, U/44 were treated similarly and marks appeared on them.
In U/44. besides the silver deposits in the gelatine, there are to be seen two
circular scratches, or ﬁssures, following the form of the marks centrally and
passing the gap. These ﬁssures appear to have penetrated to the glass in one
part. (Fig. 116, page 54.)
SKOTOGRAPHS- Para. (4) (5) Figs. 107, 108, Page 49
U/69 and U170. jlme 5H1,
1924.—After Mrs. Deane
and I had developed some
quarter-plates she had
exposed upon me, I took
from my pocket a packet
containing two quarter
plates marked U/69 and
U/70. Mrs. Deane emptied
the bath of Rodinal into
a tumbler. I placed the
two plates, sensitive sides
up, in the empty bath.
Mrs. Deane poured the
developer over them. U/69
darkened in the developer,
but showed nothing special
upon it. I asked Mrs. Deane
then to take it between her
hands, letting her ﬁngers
touch the plate. She held
it thus between her hands
some little time. The
ﬁngers have left a slight
mark upon the plate, but
at the root of the ﬁngers
is an intensely dark patch
with no ﬁnger marks, and
quite different to the
others, evidently of some Fig. 107
different origin, about f-in. long (Fig. 107). I would mention, that before
Mrs. Deane had this plate, U/69, in her hands, she dipped her hands in plain
water and wiped them on my clean duster brought with me. The plate bears
no scratches or other indication of the application of a chemical.
(4) U/F. june 231d, 1924.—After developing some plates and some ﬁlms from a
0lm pack which had been exposed upon me, we found that some of the ﬁlms
by accident had not been exposed ; they were lying in the developer and nothing
came upon them. I said to Mrs. Deane, "This is an opportunity of trying
the effect of your hands upon them." I put a towel over Mrs. Deane's left hand,
and the ﬁlm, face upwards, upon it. Mrs. Deane held
her right hand half an inch from the ﬁlm, so that the
ﬁnger tips were well within the edges. I then said,
"
Mrs. Deane, you have a wonderful power of visualising,
have you not ?
"
She agreed. I said,
"
Now visualise
your three-legged table, and we will see whether it will
come on to the ﬁlm." Two straight rods did come on to
the ﬁlm, and the vestige of a third. (Fig. 108.)
The second unexposed ﬁlm lying in the bath was
treated in the same way, and on this also appeared
bars or rods, not so deﬁnite as on the one illustrated.
(5) U/77 and U/ 78. june 30th, 1924.—After developing
four plates which had been exposed upon me through
my camera,I took two plates from my packet marked U/77 and U/78. I put them
in the developing bath. After some time faint marks appeared on U/77. I then
covered Mrs. Deane's left hand with my towel and placed upon it plate U/78,

Page 50 VFigs. ]009 to Par- (6) SKOTOGRAPHS.
sensitive side upwards, and Mrs. Deane held her right hand over it without
touching it, so that her ﬁngers were about half-an-inch from the plate. I told
Mrs. Deane to think of her three-legged table. After a time three marks came up
on the plate as seen in the illustration (Fig. 116, page 54). Uv 77 was treated in the
same way, and while Mrs. Deane was holding the plate I
under my close observation, the curious design seen in the
0
illustration(Fig. l16, page 54) appeared upon it.
Before our experiment to-day Mrs. Deane handled and
examined, and was amused with a model of “Felix the
Cat
"
I had that day brought with me for her, cast in lead.
Has the ear in the curious design in U 77 any connection with
the ear of
"
Felix the Cat," as the three strokes in U 78
would appear to be connected with my suggestion of the
three-legged table? I illustrate enlarged (Fig. 110), the
portion of the freakish mark which crudely suggests an Fig- 109
association with the model of
“
Felix." I give also a picture of my artist's view
of this part of the freak (Fig. 111) and a sketch by him made from the model
of
“
Felix." (Fig. 109)

(6) U584. july 101h, 1924.—I made a new experiment \n0th Mrs. Deane. In
order that she should not have any hand in close proximity to the plates, and to
try the effect of various metals on the plates under Mrs. Deane's inﬂuence,
I had
had constructed some instruments somewhat similar to ﬂat shovels. as shewn
Fig. 112
in the illustration (Fig. 112). made severally of iron, zinc and copper.
I
had
brought with me four quarter-plates.
U
8|, 82, 83, and 84. Mrs. Deane washed her
ﬁngers and wiped them on the clean duster
I
had, as always, brought with me.
Mrs. Deane grasped the ﬂat iron shovel by its handle with her left hand.
I
placed upon
it
plate UfSl, which
I
had pren0ously dipped in plain water.
With the right hand she held
a
second iron instrument with bent prongs over
the plate, but so that
it
did not touch it.
Mrs. Deane did not touch the plate throughout the whole proceedings.
Some characteristic marks appeared—a curved streak of ﬁve or six little circles.
I
placed the plate in the Rodinal solution. The centres of these circles appeared
to be affected in some way as
if
a bubble appeared in each.
SKOTOGRAPHS. Pars. (6'0) (7) Fig. 113 Page 51
We tried a second plate in the same manner for a long time with no result.
I then tried another plate with a
copper instrument in Mrs. Deane's
right hand. This instrument was of
copper, funnel shaped, coming to a
point. Mrs. Deane held on her left
hand a piece of sheet copper about
‘ti-in. XI-ll-in. The plate U/84 was
placed on it with the sensitive side up.
It was previously dipped in plain water
by me, and it was used wet. The point
of the funnel was held half an inch or Fig- 113
more above the plate. A mark appeared on the plate (Fig. 116, page 54),
of a copper colour (the marks produced by the iron instrument were grey).
I placed the plate in Rodinal, which did not accentuate the mark. I then tried
another plate on the sheet of copper, using a copper instrument with a hemi
spherical attachment instead of the cone, with no result.
(64;) In connection with the above instruments I used at times a wooden tunnel,
that is, a stout wooden box with open ends (two sides only and a top and
bottom). The sides were 6 inches long, 1 inch high and 4 inches wide, measured
inside. In one of the sides near the bottom there was a slot of just sufficient
width and height to allow the passage of the blade of the iron or copper shovel,
on the surface of which a photographic plate could be laid by insertion through
one of the open ends of the box. In the top of the box was a conical hole
where the metal cone could be ﬁxed so that the narrow end of the cone rested
within about } inch from the plate.
(7) CommenL—It is really interesting that the one mark should be of a copper
colour and the other of the usual grey. As regards the copper or brown colour,
it must be remembered that nearly all the marks obtained on paper, etc. by me
through Mrs. Deane are of a brown colour, and that the brown marks obtained
when using copper may not be due to the copper, but to the substance used
most frequently by the "invisible operator" in my H and F experiments.
It will be seen in my further reports (pages 52 and 60) that on other occasions
when experimenting with the copper instruments, copper-coloured marks were
obtained on the plates.
There may be some simple explanation of these copper-coloured marks.
I have made such experiments with non-mediumistic persons and never
obtained any results.
It seems to me (perhaps in my ignorance) that these experiments with copper
instruments should be repeated. Only on a few occasions have I obtained
any marks at all with these instruments with Mrs. Deane. In 1928 I carried
out some experiments especially with the object of obtaining further copper-
coloured marks. I obtained two poor ones; Deane effects are most uncertain.
U/88 and U/89,_—Aftcr Mrs. Deane had washed her hands in my presence
and wiped them with my duster. I made an experiment with two photographic
plates I had brought with me, Nos. U/88 and 89. I put on Mrs. Deane's left hand
a piece of sheet copper about 4l-in. X 31}-in. I dipped U/88 into plain water
and placed it sensitive side up on the sheet of copper. Mrs. Deane then held
a copper cone 8-in. long by l-in. in diameter at the wide end, the other (narrow)
end was open with an aperture of kin. With her right hand, Mrs. Deane held
this cone so that the narrow end was above and pointed directly downward
on to the sensitive plate, l-in. from it (Fig. 113). A very dark mark appeared,
about the size of a threepenny piece, but not round ; a second mark appeared
equally dark. Mrs. Deane remarked she had not seen such dark marks before
on any plate. These marks penetrated right through to the clear side.
Page 52 Fig. 114 Para. (8) (9) SKOTOGRAPHS.
I did not put this plate in the developing
solution, but direct into the hypo. The marks
disappeared completely in the hypo.
(8) Plate 11/89 I dipped in water and placed
on the iron shovel, while Mrs. D. held the
handle of this in her left hand, and grasped
the handle of the other iron instrument with the
three teeth bent down, in her right hand,
and held the prongs over the plate (Fig. 112,
page 50). Two little long marks about
§-in.X_{-in. appeared upon it. I then took
the plate off the iron and put it in Mrs. Deane's
left hand, sensitive side up, she holding her
right hand over the plate, with the ﬁnger
points about l-in. from the plate. Another
mark similar to the ﬁrst two appeared, and a
fourth, a shorter one. This plate I then put
in the developing dish and Mrs. Deane poured
Rodinal over it. I then placed the plate in
the hypo. I need not repeat that I watched
most carefully the whole process.
There is an interesting feature about this
photograph. It has been pointed out to me
that the spots on the large ﬁgure at the top
have positions approximating to the positions Fig. 114
of the stars in the
"
Great Bear," and that the points in the small ﬁgure at the
foot represent the "Southern Cross” in a star map; really a quite curious
fact. On viewing the illustration from the left it will be noticed that the large
central ﬁgure has distinctly the aspect of a bear.
Fig. 114A is a sketch from the photograph
w where the spots are more distinct than they
are in the above half-tone illustration.
Fig. 114B is a sketch from an astronomical
/ X map of the Great Bear and the Southern Cross
constellations reversed to conform with the
Fig. 114A Fig. 114B reversion due to the photo-printing off the plate.
Nota—T he ﬁrst two marks came while Mrs. Deane's hands were grasping
the handles of the instruments.
U/93.—0I placed a piece of sheet copper, 4}-in.X3}-in., on Mrs. Deane's left
hand. On this I placed plate U/93, after dipping it well in plain water.
I asked Mrs. Deane to hold her right hand over the plate without touching it,
or the copper, or her own hand or wrist. After a time some spotty marks
appeared on the plate (Fig. 116, page 54), of the usual character, rather more
cloudy. I then again dipped the plate in water and asked Mrs. Deane to put
aside the sheet of copper, and to hold her hands parallel to one another, l-in.
apart, under my close observation, the plate resting upon her left hand, which
grasped the edges of it, Mrs. Deane taking care not to touch the surface. An
additional mark or ﬁgure came upon it across the others, faint in character.
(9) The ﬁrst marks, those which appeared while the copper plate was below the
glass, had copper colour, the last mark was grey. I put the plate into Rodinal
solution for about a minute—the marks did not disappear, nor did the hypo
remove the marks. I took the plates away with me.
It must be remembered as regards the copper coloured marks, that in this
experiment the copper was below the glass.
SKOTOGRAPHS. Para. (10) (11) (12) Fig. 115 Page 53
U190, june I4th, 1924.—This plate was treated in the same way as U/89
except that, in this instance, copper instruments were employed instead of
iron. The upper instrument
consisted of a cone of tinned
copper (Fig. 113, page 51).
This cone was grasped in
Mrs. Deane's right hand, the
smaller end of the cone being
about l-in. above the active
surface of the plate, which had
been dipped in plain water.
The latter rested on a sheet
of copper 4i-in.X3l-in., held
in Mrs. Deane's left hand.
I transcribe the subsequent
proceedings from my con
temporary notes :—
"
In a short time quite a
number of little circular marks
appeared upon the plate, going
right through to the glass
side. I placed the plate in the
Rodinal solution and more
marks appeared. In the centre
of all these circles the gelatine
seemed to be affected, raised
up, as it were, by a bubble.
Now the plate is dry the
gelatine is seen to have been .
laceratcd; to have shrunk away, and to have left islands of plain glass in the
centres of the spots (Fig. 115, a reverse prinly" These bubbles have appeared
in other such experiments.
(10) The plate shows the markings to be of a brown coppery colour, which
occurs when a copper instrument is used in the experiments.
This is given as another case amongst many, in which the marks obtained
were not, so far as I could see, and can judge, produced by normal causes under
the stated conditions of the experiment.
(11) Comment—lt is obvious that the illustration suggests the action of small
particles of some chemical, but both Mrs. Deane's hands were fully employed,
and we have the very interesting copper colour of these spots.
(12) U/104 and U/105. I took my wooden tunnel apparatus and placed a ﬂat
zinc shovel through the slot (the handle protruding) so that the zinc covered the
bottom of the apparatus. I placed in the tapering hole in the top of the box a
copper funnel with a wide end; it was supported so that the point of it was
}-in. from the quarter-plate. Mrs. Deane held the funnel and looked down it
with her spectacles off, on to plate U/104, which I had dipped into clean water
and placed on the ﬂat zinc inside the box ; this she did for ten minutes, while
holding the zinc shovel by the handle. After ten minutes I took the plate out
and found it covered with a lot of irregular circles over a space of about l}-in.
in diameter (Fig. 116, page 54). The marks went right through to the glass and
were quite dark. I placed the plate in Rodinal solution for about ﬁfteen
Fig. 115
seconds. The marks got fainter. I then placed it in hypo. On removing it ,
from the hypo, the circular marks appeared to be blistering all over, each one
separately ; not the centres only. The gelatine dried quite ﬂat and unbroken.
The marks are of a distinctly coppery colour.

(13) Before leaving the dark room, U/lOS was treated in the same way for ten
minutes in the special apparatus. It showed no marks. Before putting it in
the Rodinal, I asked Mrs. Deane to hold it in her hands, the narrow way across
her left hand, so that the tips of the ﬁngers were outside the plate. The
sensitive side was up, and over that she held her right hand. Very soon a
peculiar straggling design appeared, nearly covering the plate. It was fairly
strong. Placed in Rodinal for a few minutes it weakened. In the hypo it
weakened still more. It did not blister. When dried, it was slightly copper
coloured. As this marking was copper coloured, the marking may have been
produced while in the apparatus, but remained latent. The holding of it by
Mrs. Deane may have been an act only of prolongation of time, that is to say,
the copper colour was possibly due to the plate having remained between the
two metals under Mrs. Deane's inﬂuence for ten minutes.

(See chapter VII.)
In addition to the unexposed plates treated by Mrs. Deane in the various
ways just described, I made other experiments with her with sensitive
photographic plates not exposed in a camera. While her hands were imprisoned
in the hand-stocks (see Fig. 181, page 108) in the dark-room, I placed many
half-plates under her hands without warning. As a rule, when I placed
half-plates under her hands we had already tried for results with paper under
her hands. While the stocks were in use the wrists were the whole time fastened
down, and not freed after any one experiment, and I wiped her imprisoned hands
between each experiment, as a rule. I was in the habit, also, at times, of placing
two quarter-plates upon the easel of the stocks. There is a ledge at the bottom
of the easel which forms a part of the stocks (see illustration, page 108). Upon
this ledge the plates rested. The sensitive side of each faced Mrs. Deane.
All these half-plates and quarter-plates I took home with me and developed
in my own rooms. The plates were always removed from the stocks before
Mrs. Deane's hands were liberated, so that it is perfectly certain—to me at least—
that Mrs. Deane had no means of dealing with the plates, and, as I say, she
never knew beforehand whether I was going to put plates or paper on the easel,
or under her hands.
Possibly she may have breathed upon the plates on the easel (sometimes
I requested her to do so) but I had my red electric torch always at hand, and was
in the habit of using it frequently ; in addition, there was the ruby window light.
Altogether I used 195 plates over twelve months in these experiments and
obtained only twenty results—about 10%. I persisted with the plates as
Mrs. Deane stated she was impressed that we should succeed in the end ; however,
towards the end successes became rarer.
(144) 120 of the plates were placed under Mrs. Deane's hands while they were in
the stocks, and it is remarkable that only in the hottest of weather were the plates
marked by her ﬁngers in any way, although her ﬁngers had rested for ﬁfteen
minutes on each. This is ample proof that plates are not so easily affected by the
hands as some think. Some persons have suggested that freak marks on Mrs.
Deane's plates are due to her hands being impregnated with photographic
chemicals. This unreasonable (in view of the character of the marks) suggestion
is disproved by my above experiments.
Forty-eight of the 195 plates were placed upon the easel in the hand-stocks.
I will now give particulars of some of the successes.
July 16th, 1925,—After two previous experiments, I fastened Mrs. Deane's
hands in the stocks and a marked quarter-plate lay on the easel during the
third experiment. Fifteen minutes. On developing the quarter-plate at home
it showed very slight cloudy marks.
(15) Fourth experimenL—A second marked quarter-plate exposed on the easel.
Mrs. Deane's hands were not freed during the third and fourth experiments.
The ﬁfth experiment with the stocks was also made while Mrs. Deane's hands
1’ag..e 56 Figs. 117 and 118 Pars. (16) (17) SKOTOGRAPHS.
remained fastened, the quarter-plate remaining
on the easel. On developing the quarter-plate
at home a distinct
"
S," Il-in. high, was found
on it. (Fig. 117.) It was not apparent before the
Rodinal acted; there is no appearance of any
thing on the surface of the gelatine. The silver
is reduced. There are a few ﬁne lines (not
scratches) along one side of it. I had brought
the quarter-plates with me. Mrs. Deane had no
opportunity of touching, nor did she touch the
plates. They were put on and taken off the
easel while her hands were imprisoned. They
were in a slide (open), which I put forthwith
into my pocket.
Fig. 117
,(16) July 23rd, 1925.— Third experiment—After two previous experiments
Mrs. Deane dipped her hands in a basin of water, which I had fetched and put
into the dark-room before the opening of to-day's proceedings, and I saw her
wipe them and helped to wipe them on the clean duster I had brought with me.
Then I locked her hands in the hand-stocks, which I had brought with me.
I never left these stocks behind. While her hands were imprisoned in the stocks
I examined them, and wiped them again with the duster, and rubbed them on a
piece of paper and examined them with my torch. I placed some special paper
under Mrs. Deane's hands, and
while this experiment was going on
I had placed on the easel a pair
of marked quarter-plates, Marion
Brilliant, sensitive side up towards
Mrs. Deane. At my request she
breathed once upon each.
At the end of this experiment
No. 3, I removed these plates and
put them in a box which I took
away with me. On dealing with
the plates next evening at home, I
found on No. 731, before putting it
into the Rodinal, a dark
"
S
"
(in
reverse) about li-in. long(Fig.118).
On putting the plates into the
Rodinal, the dark "S” remained, _
and the additional weaker mark Fos- “8
seen in the illustration came up ; this was not there previously. On examining
the plate when dry, there is nothing to be seen on the surface
of_the gelatine. The
picture is entirely due to reduced silver. There are no ﬁne lines in this
“
S"
or its supplement, such as are seen in the
“
S
”
of July 16th.
(1 7) September 24th, 1 925 ,—-Fourth experiment—Hands retained
in stocks
from a previous experiment. One dry half-plate, Marion Brilliant,
marked by
me, was put under each of Mrs. Deane's hands. I had brought these
with me.
I always bring these plates with me. There was a brown paper band, 2-m. wide,
with the upper surface painted with luminous paint, fastened over
Mrs.
Deane's
hands by means of a drawing pin at either end (as a further security). After
removing and boxing the plates I opened the door, and only then released
Mrs. Deane's hands from the stocks.
I had requested the control to put on, especially, a good ordinary Extra
SKOTOGRAPHS. Figs. 119, 120, 121 Page 57
of my old friend Frank Bird, quite recently deceased. Mrs. Deane was equally
anxious for something, saying that would clinch matters. She said the feeling
on previous occasions as to the probable success with photographic plates could
not have been a message from the other side, but must have been her own
“
wish as father to the thought." During the third experiment there were two
sounds as of cracks as if one of the plates had got broken. There were also
two distinct sounds as of something thrown at or striking a plate with a clear
hard sound.
I took the plates away with
me and developed them at my
chambers the same evening. There
was nothing to be seen by careful
examination on the plates before
they were immersed in Rodinal.
The red light I used was “Wratten
No. 3 Safety Glass." After about
a minute's immersion a mark came
up on either plate. The results are
illustrated (Figs. 119 and 120). The
larger mark of the two is certainly
suggestive of a dog's head, which
has moved, and there appear to be
dogs' legs. (Not so well seen in
the half-tone illustration as in the
photographic print). The most
noticeable feature, however, in
these two is that the smaller mark
appears to be a duplication, more
or less, of a portion of the larger
mark. In Figs. 120 and 121 the two
are placed side by side.
It must be remembered that
Mrs. Deane's hands were im
prisoned in the stocks during
this experiment and during the
previous one, and that they had
not been freed between the two
experiments; in addition there
was the luminous band securing
them. It was quite impossible for
Mrs. Deane to have removed her
hands from the stocks during this
experiment. Fig. 120 Fig. in
The experiment previous to this, with the hand-stocks, consisted in pieces
of paper placed by me under Mrs. Deane's hands to try for writing.
I consider that the results obtained to-day, especially on account of the
duplication, are very evidential of some unaccountable power in Mrs. Deane's
presence able to affect photographic plates.

October 6th, 1925.—Second experiment—Hands in stocks, with a piece of
paper under each hand; two Wratten plates on easel.
Fourth experimenL—Hands still in stocks. One half-plate Marion Brilliant
placed under each hand ; ﬁfteen minutes ; result on development by me at home,
a rough
"
cross," or two streaks, each about l-in.X%-in. on one plate ; nothing
on the other. The cross did not show before development.
Page 58 Figs. 122, 123, 124 Pars. (18) (19) SKOTOGRAPHS.
( 18) May 26th, 1926,—After an experiment with paper under Mrs. Deane's
hands while her hands were imprisoned in the stocks, I left her hands imprisoned
and carried out two more experiments by placing two
pairs of quarter-plates under Mrs. Deane's hands, one
pair at a time, with the idea of having them affected.
I had darkened the ruby window and could not see
her hands, but I had my red torch in my hand,
and used it, and Mrs. Deane did not know how much
I saw, nor when I should use the torch; result—two
of the four plates bore brown
"
S's
"
(reversed) one on
each, ll-in. high (Figs. 122 and 123); the third bore
two lines from corner to corner, crossing, also brown;
the fourth plate was blank. On taking the plates from
beneath her hands, I placed them face to face. If
wet, the mark on each plate would have affected the
plate touching it. The marks were all dissimilar ;
there was no evidence of smudging or offsetting.
It is most curious. As a rule the
"
S's" etc.,
which come on plates are not brown. I developed
the plates at home and the silver salt is affected
in each case along the mark. The lines or streaks
seen in the
"
S's
”
indicate that the
"
S's
"
were
drawn on the plates.* I am sure Mrs. Deane was
unable to do it unobserved (her wrists were
imprisoned) under the conditions prevailing.
“‘ Like the brown marks recorded in chapter VII.
(19) June 15th, 1926.—Aft8r Carrying out
experiments with Mrs. Deane, during which her
hands were taped down, ﬁrst on the double frames
with cardboard, and secondly in the stocks, I
gave Mrs. Deane, quite unexpectedly to her, two
dry quarter-plates, each dated by me, and
placed back to back, to hold between her
hands. My black cloth was over her lap. She Fig. 123
had washed her hands in my presence, and I had wiped them several times
with the duster brought with me, and rubbed them on clean paper before this ex
periment with the plates was made.
On examining the plates at home, I
noticed one of them had a distinct
brown curved streak, like the reverse
of an
“
S." On placing this in
Rodinal, the “5" remained as it
was, but the Rodinal brought out the
marking which is seen in the print,
additional to the “5" (Fig. 124).
This gives one the impression that
the lower part (the water) has been
put on the plate separately from the
"
S." The gelatine is much scratched
in the ﬁeld of the picture. The "S"
is not on the surface but in the silver.
The result is very suggestive of a
swan breasting against water, and
it is a curious fact that on the
Sunday preceding the sitting I took Fig- I14
SKOTOGRAPHS. Pars. (20) (20a) (21) Fig. 127 Page 59
a walk with my niece along the canal at Hythe in Kent, and we stood for
quite a time looking at a pair of swans with their cygncts swimming about
on the water. We stood still and talked about them. It is just possible that
the brightness of the light and my ﬁxed gaze impressed the picture of the swan
upon my mental recording apparatus, and the operator got hold of it and put it
upon the plate to the best of his ability under the conditions. Mrs. Deane knew
nothing of my Sunday walk.
From Coates' book op. cit p. 296:
"
Mrs. Bright, the late editor of the Harbinger
of Light, Melbourne, Australia, in writing to me (March 24th, 1910), says:
0
A leading
photographer here, now retired, devotes himself to trying to get spirit photographs.
He had a curious experience a short time ago. He simply holds the plates in his hands.
One day in Sydney harbour, on a visit, he had been much interested in watching a man
in a canoe in the harbour. This is not seen in Melbourne. That night he held his plate.
Next day developed it. There was a small ﬁgure on the plate, and this on close
examination proved to be a reproduction of the man in the canoe, of the previous
day's interest." See
also (336) p. 315.
(20) July 27th, 1926_—After an experiment with Mrs. D's hands pinned
down in the stocks, I did not free her hands, but slipped under them two half
plates, Marion Brilliant. After ten
minutes I removed the glass plates and
did not see anything on them. I then put
two fresh half-plates under Mrs. Deane's
hands (still locked up) and we sat for
another ten minutes. I removed these
plates and boxed them while Mrs. Deane's
hands were still imprisoned. On develop
ing the plates at my chambers I found
an
"
S
"
on one of them 2-in. high, with
some lines at the bottom (Fig. 127) as if
a swan had been attempted, similar to
that of June 15th last. It was not so good
as that (Fig. 124, page 58). The silver has
been affected in parts; in parts some-
thing appears to have prevented the
developer acting upon the silver. There
are streaks in the
“
S," but the general
appearance is not as if it were put on by
a brush. There are no ﬁnger marks.
Fig. 127
(20¢) 0n january 3rd, 5th, Ioth, MM, 171h, Igth and 24th, I tried experiments
with the shovel apparatus and copper cone, in order to obtain copper coloured
marks on photographic plates as previously (see pages 52 to 54). Out of sixteen
plates, on two only did freakish marks appear, and these were of a coppery
colour. These experiments were in 1928 with Mrs. Deane at my warehouse.
Further experiments at the author's warehouse in I 928.
(21) November 26th, 1928.—Present, Mrs. Deane and the author. Mrs. D.
came early. She was in a good humour. The object I had in view at the
moment was to obtain the copper effect on plates, whichI obtained on several
occasions. I put the black cloth over Mrs. Deane's lap in the light, and as
I was beginning I noticed some glittering crystals on the cloth occupying a
space of about I-in. Xi-in. I pointed to the crystals. I turned the cloth over
and used the other side. On analysis the crystals were found to be amidol.

I then gave Mrs. Deane the handles of two copper shovels (Fig. 112) to
hold, one in each hand; the instruments were ﬁxed in the wooden holder.
While Mrs. Deane's hands were thus occupied I placed a quarter-plate, which I
had damped in water. on the lower shovel. I watched by means of the red light
in the room. Shortly I noticed a little heap of crystals on one border of the
plate. How they got there, I know not, as Mrs. Deane's hands were occupied
in holding the handles. We had another similar experiment. Nothing came
on the second plate. I put the plate with
the heap of crystals on it in Rodinal, and
the crystals affected deeply the silver in
the gelatine and the gelatine itself, more
than any Deane plate I have ever seen.
After the sitting I damped a plate in the
dark-room and pressed it on the cloth in
various parts, on the side where I had
seen the crystals, wherever there was a
slight glitter. On putting this plate into
Rodinal freakish grey spots appeared, where
the silver had evidently been acted upon
by the crystal salt. A print of it (Fig. 128)
shows the result somewhat similar to some
of Mrs. Deane's freakish Extras; not
exactly like any. A simple explanation of
the presence of the crystals on the cloth is
that Mrs. Deane put them there; on the
other hand they were of such a glittering
character and in such a position that it
was obvious I should see them. Again, as Fis- 118
I had pointed out to Mrs. Deane the presence of the crystals on the cloth, is it
likely she would put crystals on the plate I then proceeded to experiment with,
knowing, as she must have done, that I should certainly look out for crystals on
the plate, having seen some on the cloth? No; though it affects in no wise
my many unequivocal results I venture to state that I think the crystals were
apported. In my many experiments I have had ample evidence of results
obtained with material not present, and where Mrs. Deane could not under
the conditions have produced the effects with the material used, had any such
been present in the room, the writing of the word Peggy, for instance (see page 202).
Again, freak markings have appeared on plates numberless times under such
careful observation on my part that I can surely testify that Mrs. Deane did not
tamper with the plates ; the examination of these and many other freak markings
on her plates has convinced me that some (not all) of them were produced by
the action of a chemical (used by an invisible operator?) and on this day I
found on the cloth a chemical which does produce similar (not exactly the
same) markings on the negative—only the previous experiences of mine would
allow me to suggest the crystals were apported, which idea I do not expect many
readers to accept. In the coming centuries when persons endowed similarly
to Mrs. Deane have been experimented with, and similar happenings are
discovered, my opinion may prove to be correct. In the meantime, as our
ignorance of these supernormal things is so complete, let us at least be charitable
in our thoughts towards our medium ; especially as the opinion that Mrs. Deane
brought the crystals knowingly does not affect my many irrefragable results.
This is the kind of experience one has at times in psychical research ;
experiences which lead many to abandon the work, but which cannot cancel the
deﬁnitely indisputable results, and which show the necessity for a lengthy series
of experiments in this branch of study.
CHAPTER V.
Mr. F. Mcc. Slephenson's experiments
with Mr. William Hope and Mrs. Buxton at Crewe.
It is not necessary for me to put before the readers for whom this book
is written, viz. '. students of psychic phenomena with a knowledge of the chief
facts of psychic photography, the particulars of the methods adopted and
results obtained during the last two decades at what is known as the Crewe
Circle, or a description of Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton ; nor will I enter into a
lengthy discussion of the charges brought against them by some members of the
conjuring fraternity, which charges, good judges* consider, were quite
inadequately sustained. It is an established principle with all seriously under
taken experiments in the psychic domain that no conclusion should be come to
without a long series of tests, and that it is unjust and unfair to bring an
accusation in this matter after one or two trials only.
Almost the only weighty attack upon both Mr. Hope and Mrs. Deane was
made by Mr. Barlow, certainly a leading authority on psychic photography
for many years and with no lack of experimental knowledge. Mr. Barlow
had the assistance, in his latest investigation, of a professional photographer,
Major R. Rose. These two gentlemen read a paper before the Society for
Psychical Research in November, 1932, giving an account of their conclusions
(see Proa, S.P.R., March, 1933). This was followed by a letter from
Mr. Barlow, published in the S.P.R. journal of July, 1933.
Their article contained little that was not already well known to students
of the subject, and indeed mentioned in Coates' book and elsewhere, such as
evidence in the prints of double exposure, cut-out pictures, cotton wool, incorrect
lighting, screen marks, etc.
These features are obvious to any photographer and would be known
to anyone venturing on fraudulent psychic photography. Anyone wishing to
embark upon such fraud would naturally ﬁrst become an expert in genuine
photography and surely would avoid all these indications of fraud, especially
after they had been pointed out, as they have been incessantly.
Mr. Barlow found that luminous paint behind a ﬁlm transparency will
impress a negative on a sensitive plate in a few seconds, and has pointed out
how easily such a small cut-out face, backed with luminous paint and a thin
piece of metal or card to keep it ﬂat, can be ﬁxed to the ﬁnger point and pressed
against a sensitive platert
Such is, indeed, the fact; and Mr. Barlow remindedusthat since the accusation
was brought against Hope of substituting plates allowing of large Extras, mostly
small Extras have appeared on Hope's plates, such as those obtained by
Mr. Stephenson, illustrated herein.
In view of our absolute ignorance of the source of the phenomena it is not
unreasonable to suggest that the operator (whoever or whatever that may
eventually turn out to be) and not Mr Hope's conscious self was inﬂuenced by
the accusation of the substitution of plates to use a new procedure.
In this chapter will be found particulars of a test made by myself and
Mr. Stephenson with Mr. Hope where my own camera, slides and plates were
used at Crewe, Hope having no opportunity of touching the plates which were
* See Dr. W. Franklin Prince in the journal Amer. S.P.R., October, 1923, page 574.
1' The ﬁrst mention I ﬁnd of such a luminous paint device is in a letter to Light, 1909, p.575.
That some such instrument, but too large to be easily hidden, was used at times in the
production of Hope Extras is evident from the illustrations on p. 88 herein.

Page 62 HOPE-STEPHENSON.
returned, still in my slides, to London where I saw them developed by my
professional photographer. On this occasion all Hope did was to remove the
cap; yet Extras, similar to those produced by luminous paint discs, appeared
when the plates were developed in London. (See (27) p. 79.)
Mr. Stephenson and 0I are not alone in obtaining these small Extras when
trickery was impossible. (See (2860) p. 290.)
Bearing in mind the number* of large Extras obtained with Hope and
Mrs. Deane under unassailable test conditions and the small Extras also
obtained under test conditions, we are forced to conclude that there is solid
ground for concluding that many Hope Extras were produced supernormally.
The origin of Extras, however fraudulent some may appear to be, is an insoluble
problem at present. In pars. (337) to (338) pp. 316 to 320 of the Appendix
I deal more fully with this question.
Mr. Barlow's conclusion that Mr. Hope was a constant trickster seems, in
view of the great esteem in which he was held by those who have known him
for many years and at whose houses he has stayed over and over again and who
had every opportunity of judging his character, seems exceedingly improbable.
This, however, is not an argumentum ad rem ; more important it is to bear
in mind that Mr. Barlow's facts and conclusions do not cancel out the conclusions
drawn from the mass of abnormal effects obtained under the strictest conditions
by most careful investigators (including Mr. Barlow) with Hope and Mrs. Deane
and other psychic photographers, recorded in the books and journals dealing
with psychic subjects. See pp. 11 and 380 to 382.
The best answer to their paper is Mr. Barlow's reports of his own many
test experiments spread over many years and his previous writings; see the
chapter contributed by him to Coates' Photographing the Invisible (second
edition), his preface to and chapter in Conan Doyle's Case for Spirit Photography,
his luminous twenty-three page defence of psychic photography against an
adverse article in a Psychic Research quarterly in 1921, and his many articles in
the Budgets of the Society for the Study of Supernormal Pictures and in Light
Mr. James Coates, than whom no one possessed more practical experience
or exercised saner judgment in psychic photography, said of Mr. Hope :
"
No
man—in my opinion—has been tested more or his mediumship better
demonstrated. It is because I know the facts of psychic photography that I
have long since dismissed the fraud theory as wholly inapplicable as an
explanation."—Light, 1921, p. 91.
Only some extreme hypothesis of a frivolous unmerciful poltergeist or
Dr. Gustave Geley's hypothesis of the subconsciousness of the medium
possessing exteriorisation power (Geley's L'Etre subconscient, Felix Alcan,
Paris, 1899) and directive intelligence will reconcile the opposing data, always
with the help of the deus ex machinti the Fourth dimension.
I come now to my own experiments with the Crewe Circle, and those carried
out with that circle on my behalf.
My business activities preventing frequent visits to Crewe, I made use
as already appears from the above, of my friend and business colleague,
Mr. F. McC. Stephenson, who is in Cheshire three or four times a year, to call
at Crewe and have sittings with Mr. Hope's Circle as often as possible.
Mr. Stephenson undertook to conduct the sittings in accordance with instructions
laid down by me, and to do his best to persuade the Crewe Circle to use my
camera, slides and plates, and allow the plates to be developed by me in London.
It was not possible to obtain Mr. Hope's consent on every occasion to do what
I required, but I obtained some useful evidence, as will be seen from the
following reports. I am indeed exceedingly grateful to Mr. Stephenson for
the tact and ability exercised to obtain such unusual concessions from the
oSee References to Light, p. 381.
HOPE-STEPHENSON. Page 63
Crewe Circle as he obtained for me. Mr. Hope, would not, as a rule, part with
the plates.
This was a great pity, as much existing in the negatives has doubtless been
undiscovered because of inadequate printing methods. The possession of a
number of the plates enabled me to discover the surface marks and rings or
circles which I describe in this chapter.
With some of the results the conditions were such as to leave no room for
doubt as to the genuineness of the Extras. But if the evidence of Miss Scatcherd
and Dr. Lindsay Johnson as to the conditions under which the well-known
"White Rose" Extra* appeared is not generally accepted, I _cannot expect my
reports to fare better; nevertheless, I give the facts.
I deal further with the Barlow-Rose paper in the Appendix (see p. 304).
Meanwhile I insert here the following letter from Mr. F. McCarthy Stephenson.
"
At ’Mr. Warrick's request I undertook to assist him by having sittings at
the Crewe Circle as often as possible; as I am frequently in the North of
England I was able to do this, and had many photographic sittings with
Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton during the ﬁve years from 1927 to 1932.
"The object of these sittings was to learn all we could about psychic
photography.
“Both Mr. Warrick and I were very much alive to the possibility of trickery
being practised and I would like it to be known by those interested in these
experiments that I never relaxed my vigilance and used every endeavour to
discover the origin of the abnormal results obtained.
"Altogether I had 440 plates submitted to the inﬂuence of Mr. Hope and
Mrs. Buxton, and I claim that it is extremely unlikely and in fact impossible
that, if trickery had been practised upon me, I should not have discovered it,
at least on one occasion, and I am as conﬁdent as I can be of anything, that I
was not deceived.
"I have perused the reports of these sittings contained in Mr. Warrick's book
and can certify them as being correct. -
“
Emphatically I do not agree that Hope either could or did touch the plates
in the way suggested by Mr. Barlow, i.e., by means of transparent pictures
backed by luminous paint or a miniature electric light. In the ﬁrst place to get
anything on the plate except at the extreme top, which occupies, of course, the
lowest part of the slide in the camera, would necessitate the shutters being
pulled up at least half way in most of the illustrations given in Mr. Warrick's
book and in some cases fully three-quarters—and to say that this could have
been done many times without being noticed by me
is,
everyone must admit,
out of all reason. Many of the Hope Extras on the plates sent to me by
Mr. Warrick are right in the middle of the plate and even lower down than
that. The most incontrovertible fact
is
that we got exactly similar Extras
to those produced by Mr. Barlow's luminous paint device when Mr. Warrick's
camera, slides and plates were used, and the plates did not enter the dark-room
at Crewe, but were posted by me to London directly after the sitting and were
developed there. On one occasion Hope did not touch either the plates or the
slides when everything of Mr. Warrick's was used, and on one occasion
when Mr. Warrick's camera, slides and plates were used
I
even raised and lowered
the shutters myself
;
on this occasion Hope did not touch the camera
;
he simply
removed the cap which covered the lens, and yet Extras came similar to those
referred to above.
"I might add that
I
commenced my visits to Crewe as an absolute sceptic
and at the present day, while
I
cannot deny the genuineness of the Hope Extras
after my prolonged experiments,
I
have no theory to offer as to the source of
them. (Signed) F. McC. STEPHENSON."

Mr. Stephenson is a very suitable person for the work, not being biassed for
or against the phenomena, and not associating them in the least with his
religious tenets or his emotions. Like the author of this book, he regards these
strange things as actual, but inexplicable at the present day. Mr. Stephenson
too, has had experience in psychic research. He had attended several sittings
of the Goligher Circle in Dr. Crawford's time, and. indeed, conducted on my
behalf a Goligher test sitting after Dr. Crawford's death. The report of this
sitting was published in an issue of the Psychic Research Quarterly, and in The
Goligher Circle.
Previous to his systematic attendance at the Crewe Circle at my request
(commenced in June, 1927), Mr. Stephenson had sat on several occasions at
Mr. Hope's, and was familiar with the proceedings 0and surroundings. The result
at one of these early sittings (August 1918) is interesting.
(22) On that occasion he was accompanied by a lady friend. While the camera
was exposed upon Mr. Stephenson, the lady was seated a few feet away from
him. An Extra appeared upon the plate. This Extra was recognised by the
lady as a portrait of her late father, who had died in Australia nineteen or
twenty years ago, and of whom no photograph existed in this country. The
lady was unknown to Hope. The face was an» unusual one and deﬁnite, not
a mere smudge.
(22a) Before giving an account of Mr. Stephenson's visits to Crewe in 1927
and onwards, I will give particulars of a visit I made there in August, 1928.
I brought the plates and marked them as I inserted them into Mr. Hope's
slide as he held it for me in his dark-room.
On two out of the six plates exposed there were abnormal results; in the
one case a cloudy oval about my head, in the other, Extra faces (Fig. 129,
page 65). One of the faces reminded me of the late Dr. Crawford.
Mr. Stephenson, who had visited Dr. Crawford several times, when he saw
the print, expressed the opinion, without any suggestion from me, that it
represents the late Dr. Crawford. Mrs. Crawford considers it like her late
husband, but expressionless. Mr. Stoupe, of Belfast, who met Dr. Crawford
daily, considers the portrait is not that of Dr. Crawford, and wrote me that
others, to whom he showed the photograph, who knew Dr. Crawford, do not
recognise the face.
Now, there is a lack of detail in the photograph ; it is very free from all
expression, and therefore but a poor likeness at best, but those who, as was
the case of Mr. Stephenson with Dr. Crawford, see a person but occasionally,
assimilate certain simple characteristics of face, which are lost to intimate friends
by the mass of detail which the latter ﬁll into their picture. If this is not an
intended (bungled) Crawford photograph, why should it be so like him as to
impress Mr. Stephenson so strongly, Mrs. Crawford somewhat, also Mr. Hunter?
There are millions of other faces, quite unlike, and the chances are surely a
million to one against even so indistinct a likeness.
Mr. Hunter, whose letter to myself I am about to refer to, wrote me anent
the photograph :—
“I recognise the mask-like face as a photograph of the late
Dr. W. J. Crawford. Let me add this: Dr. Crawford, not quite as one
remembers him, but Crawford who has passed through a trying time!"
oThe sitter (the author) is Dr. Crawford's literary executor and both he and Mr. Hope
received a great shock on learning his tragic end. Is there any connection between these
facts and the exceptionally featureless Extra?

Mr. Arthur Hunter, of Ballycastle, Co. Antrim, has attended the Goligher
Circle conducted by the late Dr. Crawford, and when I took over Dr. Crawford's
papers in 1920, exchanged a letter or two with me (in 1921). He remembered
me so little, however, that when he visited London in September, 1928, he did
not communicate with me, although he had few acquaintances in this city.
He knew nothing, of course, of my visit to Crewe ; no publication of it had been
made, and I had mentioned the matter to very few persons. Mr. Hunter states
he was absolutely ignorant of it.
I was therefore surprised to receive the following letter from Mr. Hunter :—
Ballycastle, Co. Antrim,
16th September, 1928.
"Dear Mr. \'t0arrick,
I.ast week I had occasion to be in London, and during my stay I had
two séances with Mr. Vout Peters. At the ﬁrst sitting several evidential
messages reached me from relatives and friends, and then one from
Dr. Crawford. On the occasion of the second sitting, Crawford came almost
at once, and occupied the entire time.
Most of the communication and conversation was conﬁdential, evidential
and corroborative of my own knowledge, etc. But he gave me a message
which he obligated me to pass on to you, viz.: 0Tell him I urge him to
publish his work at the earliest moment, giving his discoveries to date—
test-proof and fool-proof. Not to await fresh data, but to go ahead at
once, giving illustrations and diagrams. Tell him that I tried to get my
photograph through to him, but I am not sure whether I have been successful
or not, but, not to delay ; to go ahead with the publication at once.' With
your name the name
o
Warren
'
occurred twice, to be, apparently, substituted
for your surname.
I had already seen accounts of your research work in the Psychic College
Quarterly, and was deeply interested. However, this acquaintance with
your work had nothing whatever to do with the message, which surprised me.
Yours sincerely,
(Signed) ARTHUR HUNTER."
Mr. Hunter then wrote me a long letter in reply to various questions I put
to him. I print below parts of his reply to me.
Ballycastle, Co. Antrim,
2lst September, 1928.
"Dear Mr. Warrick,
I had not been to London for ten years. I talked to very few people
and had no conversation with anyone likely to know anything of your
more recent work.
As I wrote you, I made an appointment with Mr. Vout Peters, and had
two sittings with him.
The second sitting was practically all Crawford, and principally of a
conﬁdential nature.
In reply to your questions :—
(1) It astounded me to realise that your name did not occur to me
in any way before going to London, nor during my stay there,
until the name
“
Warren
"
came through. This name distressed
the medium, who said it was not quite correct. Then I began
to think, and for the ﬁrst time your name ﬂashed into my mind.
I suggested your name and the medium expressed pleasure and
said the name was correct. This was the only suggestion I made.
(2) Until your recent letter arrived I had no knowledge of your
visit to Hope at Crewe, nor of any results obtained.
HOPE-STEPHENSON. Par. (22b) Figs. 132 & 133 Page 67
(3) I have not seen nor heard from Hope of Crewe since his visit to
Belfast, when I met him on 18th September, 1922. At this date
we obtained a psychograph from Crawford addressed to Hope.
The plates used were mine and the sitting was supervised by me,
and, I believe, fraud-proof.
Regarding the Crewe photograph, I recognise the mask-like face (at an
angle to the top of your head) as a photograph of the late Dr. W. 1. Crawford.
Let me add this—Crawford, not quite as we remember him, but Crawford
who has passed through a trying time—a severe illness, mental and physical,
and that I know to be in accordance with the facts of the case. It is
decidedly obvious that Crawford tried hard to get on this plate and, I should
say, was suffering mental distress (as to whether he was successful or not)
at the time of trying. I see three other attempts on the print.

Mr. F. McC. Stephenson's experiments.
Unless it is otherwise stated, the plates were supplied marked and dated by the author, who
sent them to .lIr. Stephrnson, who returned them to London where they were developed by a
professional photographer in the author's presence. Constant vigilance was exercised by
.111. Stephenson. -
June 17th, 1927; »l’resent : Mr. Hope, Mrs. Buxton, and Mr. Stephenson.
Mr. Stephenson bought one packet of twelve and one packet of six plates and
"
wrote his name and initials all over both packets in his car outside the shop
in which they were bought."
After the usual ceremony the packets were held for two minutes between
the three pairs of hands.
(22b) Experiments for Skot0graphs.-—.\Ir. Stephenson wrote me the same day :—
“
Mrs. Bnxton held my (unopened) packet of siX plates to her forehead,
and gave it a rotary movement. Mr. Hope asked me on which plates I
desired the results. I said 2 and 4. I put the packet in my pocket. Hope
and I adjourned to the dark-room. I opened the packet and marked the
plates Nos. 1 to 6, and initialled them PS. I put these in the dish.

Page 68 Fig. 134 HOPE-STEPHENSON
l poured on the developer and watched carefully. Results came on 2 and
4(F10gs. 132 and 133,1). 67). Impossible for .\lr. Hope to have done anything to
the plates without my knowledge. My control was faultless. l was allowed
to take these plates. Nos. 2 and
,4,
away with me, and will send them to you
when they are dry."
Mr. Stephenson reported, with reference to the other packet, that
it
remained
in his pocket. He wrote Z—
"l put four plates into the slides after initialling them.
l
examined
the camera. Four exposures were made.
I
took the plates out of the slides
and poured the solution over them. On two of the
plates Extras appeared."
One of the Extras
is
here illustrated (Fig. 134).
Mr. Stephenson wrote me
a
few days later :—
"While Mrs. Buxton was holding the packet
I
did not lose sight of it, and when the packet was
returned to me
I
examined it to identify it.
In the developing room
1
put the plates in
the bath;
I
never lost sight of them, and
it
was an utter impossibility for any other plates to
be substituted, or anything done to those used,
unknown to me.
I
am as positive that no trick
of any kind was played on me, or the plates, as
I
am that
I
am alive at this moment."
Fig. 134
August 121b, 1927.—Present: Mr. Stephenson, Mr. Hope, and Mrs. Buxton.
Mr. Stephenson reported to me :—
“I took two packets of plates with me which
I
had bought of
a
chemist
at Chester, each containing one dozen, and, at my request, the chemist
sealed both packets of plates with the printed gummed wafer slips you sent
me, and
I
wrote my initials on the outside of both the sealed unopened packets
of plates. On Mr. Hope's instructions
I
put the two packets on
a
table and
we placed our hands upon the table with ﬁngers touching, thus making
a
circle round the packets.
We sang
a
hymn, and then Mr. Hope prayed for some indication that those
who had passed over were still with us in spirit. Mrs. Buxton started
another hymn, and we had another prayer.
Mr. Hope asked me which of the packets of plates
I
wanted Mrs. Buxton
to try for
a
possible skotograph, and which
I
wanted to use for the exposures.
I
picked up the bottom packet for the skotographs, and marked
it
on the out
side (the other unopened packet was left on the table). Mr. Hope asked
me on which of the twelve plates
I
would like any result to appear.
I
said
on numbers
2
and
4,
that
is
counting from No.
l
to No. 12-—the outside
label on the wrapper being reckoned nearest to No.
1.
Mrs. Buxton then
told me to hold the packet of plates to her forehead with my left hand
;
this
I
did, and Mr. Hope placed his hand over mine. Mrs. Buxton did not
touch the plates, or the packet, or her forehead, except to brush her hair
away from her forehead.
I
held the packet for about a minute. Mrs. Buxton
seemed to be in a kind of tremor
;
her hands,
I
noticed, opened and closed,
and she clutched her handkerchief.
I
put the packet of plates back into
my pocket for development later."
HOPE-STEPHENSON. Pars. (22c) (22d.) Fig 135 Page 69
Messrs. Hope and Stephenson then went into the dark-room where Mr.
Stephenson loaded two of Mr. Hope's double slides, after examining them,
with four plates from the other packet he had brought with him. He
initialled the plates and numbered them. Mr. Stephenson wrote me he was
the sitter :—
"Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton stood behind or beside the camera. Mr.
Hope pulled up the shutter and gave an exposure of about a minute and
a half. This process was repeated four times. I may add that Mr. Hope
and Mrs. Buxton joined hands above the camera prior to the shutter being
drawn, and Mr. Hope covered his eyes with his other hand and appeared to
pray.
"
Messrs. Hope and Stephenson then proceeded to the dark-room to develop
the exposed plates and also the plates held for skotographs. Mr. Stephenson
wrote me that he examined carefully the packet which had been held to Mrs.
Buxton's forehead : he wrote :—
" I carefully examined the packet and found my wafer labels unbroken,
but, as I have said, the packet had not left my possession. I took out the
top packet of four plates, unwrapped them and marked Nos. 2 and 4, 5.2.,
5.4. I then placed these two plates in the dish and poured over them the
developing solution." .
Mr. Stephenson then proceeded to develop the exposed plates. He wrote :—
"As already stated the plates used for the skotographs never left my
possession from the time I bought
them until I handed them to you."
As to the results: On the exposed
plates there was an Extra on one of
the four. A very well-deﬁned face
surrounded by a mass of cloudy
material, such as is often seen in psychic
photographs.
(22c) As to the two skotographs: On
No. 2, the silver salt has not been
affected. In No. 4, the silver salt was
affected. A print is given (Fig. 135).
It contains a decided face. In the
surrounding cloud there are streaks;
no scratching of the gelatine.
(22d) In addition there are all over the
plate, and beyond the Extra, brush
like-marks (Fig. 135a, page 70). These
surface marks have appeared on
plates used in Hope experiments when
the plates were developed under my
(the author's) supervision in London
(see page 81).

.\
(23) August 27th, 1927.—I gave Mr. Stephenson, in London, my camera
with three slides loaded with two plates, each marked C1 to C6, also, in two
packets, six plates marked HCl to HC6, and six plates marked Sl to S6, and
all, in addition, initialled by me.
Present at the sitting: Mr. Hope, Mrs. Buxton, and Mr. Stephenson.
I abstract the following from Mr. Stephenson's detailed report to me :—
“
I can assure you that none of the plates were handled by Mr. Hope or
Mrs. Buxton. As regards your camera, Mr. Hope inserted each slide which
I handed to him. Whilst one of the slides was being used I had charge of
the other two; they were in my pocket. These slides were posted to you
the same evening, exactly as they were.
As regards the plates used in Mr. Hope's camera, I put the plates in his
slide and I took them out and put them in the dish and developed them
myself. Further details would be a copy of my last report."
In the following remarks I make use of Mr. Stephenson's report to me.
Usual ceremony. Usual watchfulness by Mr. Stephenson.
First experimenL—The packet of six plates sent by me marked 51 to S6
were used for skotographs. Result: None at all.
Two of my double slides used in my camera. Mr. S. handed the slides one
at a time to Hope to insert and took possession of each slide as withdrawn and
put it in his pocket and posted them to me. Mr. Stephenson wrote me the next
day: “I can assure you that not one of the plates was handled by Mr. Hope
or Mrs. Buxton", and again : "There could have been no trickery. l was very
much awake the whole time and noted every movement." In view of the
above statements the possibility of Mr. Hope dealing with the broken plate
(see below) out of sight under a black cloth without being observed by Mr.
Stephenson or Mrs. Buxton seems very remote.
Result: An Extra on one of the four plates, vz0z.: Cl, (Fig. 136, page 71).
Further remarks upon this plate will be found at the end of the report of this day.
HOPE-STEPHENSON. Figs. 136 and 138 Page 71
I have been asked what became of the third
double slide. The correspondence shows that
Mr. Stephenson returned me the three double slides
and did not tell me until after all six plates had
been developed in London which four out of the six
had been exposed. They were C1, C2, C3, C4;
exposed in the order here given.
In answer to another question I would say that
Mr. Stephenson reported that no cloth was put over
the camera when it was being loaded or the shutters
withdrawn; indeed the shutters are too trouble
some to be handled out of sight, on account of the
catches.
Then Mr. Stephenson put two of my plates
marked HC. 1 and 2 into Mr. Hope's double slide.
Mr. Hope then exposed them in his own camera
(which had been examined by Mr. Stephenson) upon Mr. Stephenson. The two
plates were then developed by Mr. Hope in Mr. Stephenson's presence. An
Extra appeared on one of them. This plate, after ﬁxing
and washing, was taken away-, while still wet, by
Mr. Stephenson and sent to me for printing. The
HC Extra is illustrated (Fig. 138). In the photographic
print itself faces are clearly evident.
Fig. 136
Mr. Stephenson wrote me at the time that he
watched all the proceedings with the greatest care, and
that there was no chance for any cheating.
Now, as regards the plate CI, which I had sent
inserted in No. l compartment of my double slide, with
compartments 1 and 2, I found on examination that
this compartment of the slide was faulty, the ridge or
barrier at the foot of the compartment separating the
plate from the shutter was broken away, the result
being that the plate had evidently, through the shaking
it was submitted to on its journey to Crewe, jumped
the diminished barrier at its foot, and the lower edge of
this plate was no doubt resting against the shutter when Fit; 133
the slide was inserted in the camera, and when this
shutter was raised the slight shaking ensuing most probably caused the said
plate to cant still further; so that when the shutter was pushed down after
exposure it would come in contact with the plate at two-thirds of its length from
the top edge and break the plate across there. I found by several experiments
that this always does happen. I have experimented several times by dropping
closed loaded slides and have found the enclosed plate always broken
irregularly; and then only if violently thrown down. But when the plate is
broken across by the shutter, the shutter could not be pressed down any further,
and to save the plate from exposure to light it would be necessary to take the
camera to the dark-room and carry out the required manipulation in safe light,
which was certainly not done. As stated, this C1 bore an Extra. (Fig. 136.)
Now, when the slide was opened in my presence by my professional photo
grapher in London, in red light, the plate was found to be broken at exactly
the place at which it would be broken. and has been broken every time by me,
experimentally, under the conditions described above. The lower, shorter piece
of the broken plate (nearly an exact third part of the length of the plate) is
covered with ﬁnger-marks, showing that the plate had been subjected to much
Page 72 Fig. 139 HOPE-STEPHENSON.
Fig. 139
ﬁngering, done. one must conclude, to put it back in its proper position to allow
the shutter to be pushed right home. When did this happen ? It could only
have been done in safe light. I questioned Mr. Stephenson immediately, and
very closely on every detail of this sitting, and he assured me that Hope did
not tamper with the slide. It was not an easy matter to deal with the broken
plate, especially if one is not familiar with the particular slide; as all know,
there are many varieties of plate-holding devices.
A normal explanation would be that, after Mr. Stephenson had handed
my slide to Mr. Hope to insert it in the camera, Mr. Hope kept his back to Mr.
Stephenson and with the slide (with small catches, and unfamiliar to him)
in front of him, covered it with a black cloth to keep out the light (for the plate
is not fogged), pulled up the shutter, pressed the luminous paint device attached
to his finger on to the plate thereby producing the Extra; then, on pushing
the shutter down, broke the plate and pressed the broken piece into position
thereby covering it with ﬁngermarks; all this had to be done in a few seconds
with Mr. Stephenson and Mrs. Buxton looking on. It does not seem possible;
Mr. Stephenson says it was certainly not done; yet such an explanation would
have to be accepted were equally unbelievable supernormal phenomena in the
presence of mediums for psychic photography not proved by a mass of other
experiments with them—and such power I maintain has been decisively proved
by my H and F experiments with Mrs. Deane, chapter VII.
On another occasion :1 raising of the shutter of one of my slides at
Crewe is in evidence, (28") p. 96, Fig. 170; but the exposed portion is fogged.
The reconciliation of these bafﬂing pros and cons is very difﬁcult.
HOPE-STEPHENSON. Par. (24) Fig. 140 Page 73
The following note in Mr. Stephenson's letter to me may be of interest :—
"
You will remember my telling you that Mrs. Buxton's daughter was
married last week. Mr. Hope took a photograph of the wedding party. I
enclose a print of it. The man standing at the extreme left is Mr. Buxton ;
next to him is Mrs. Buxton; between them has come an Extra of their
dead son. This photograph was, of course, taken in the open, with no
thought or expectation of anything abnormal coming." More mystery!
For illustration see Fig. 431, page 293.
December 22nd, 1927,—Present : Mr. Hope. Mr. Stephenson, and
Mrs. Buxton. Mr. Stephenson had bought the plates the day before. He
wrote me on the .oZlst inst. :
“
I have everything in order, I have initialled (in a
dark-room) and inserted each plate in a black paper envelope." I had sent
Mr. Stephenson envelopes of black paper, in which to insert the plates. To-day
was devoted solely to skotographic experiments with naked plates.
Mr. Stephenson reported to me as follows, as to the treatment to which
the plates were subjected :—
“
(a) Mr. Hope held three dry plates one after the other between his
hands, including No. II of the series.
(b) Mrs. Buxton held.two dry plates between her hands, one after the
other.
(0)
Mr. Stephenson held two dry plates. one after the other, between
his hands.
(d) Mr. Hope held one dry plate (No.
9
of the series) to his forehead.
(c)
Mrs. Buxton held two dry plates to her forehead, one after the other.
(f) Mr. Hope held one damped plate between his hands.
(g) Mrs. Buxton held one damped plate between her hands.”
Fig. 140
(24) The plates were all sent to me for development. In two out of the
twelve the silver salt had been affected, viz.
:
in one plate, No.9 of the series
(Fig. 140), held dry by Mr. Hope to his forehead, and in
a
second, No. 11 of
the series held dry by Mr. Hope between his hands.
Page 74 Fig. 141 Par. (24a) HOPE-STEPHENSON.
Mr. Stephenson assures me that there was no opportunity for the marks seen
in the reproductions to have been put on normally without his observing the
act. He wrote me at the time :—
"I put the plates into Mr. Hope's hands, and we stood shoulder to
shoulder. Mr. Hope held each plate ﬂat between his hands, and did nothing
to it. He held his hands as one does in prayer. Each plate was put by me
into its black envelope after the experiment before the next plate was given
out to be used."
These two plates were used quite dry. The gelatine is not scratched. The
plates were developed in my presence by a professional photographer.
Perhaps such pictures could be produced by the rapid movement of two or
three spots of bright light (maybe emanating from the luminous paint device
mentioned on page 61). Such movement by Mr. Hope would of course have been
very apparent to Mr. Stephenson.
(24a) It is curious that in addition to the reductions of the sensitive silver salt
the gelatine is nearly completely covered with brush-like marks of a brown colour
in the case of both of these plates, and there are no similar marks on any of the
other ten plates held.
These marks are not at all like ﬁnger-marks. In many cases where such
marks have been found Mr. Stephenson assures me the plates were not touched
at all by Mr. Hope. The brown colour is very distinct in these.
In the case of the plate No. 9 the surface marks follow the conﬁguration as Fig.
140 p. 73, but are not so deﬁnite, see Fig. 14021 on next page. The surface lines
on plate No. 11 (shown in Fig. 141 below) do not follow the conﬁguration of
the photograph, though they are mostly in the same part of the plate.
Fig. Hi
The above ﬁgure represents the brown surface marks seen on the gelatine of plate No.
II bearing skotograph (see p. 73). The marks do not correspond with the lines in the
skotograph. (Not illustrated.)
If we accept Mr. Stephenson's report as correct, as I think we are entitled to
according to his letter on p. 63, there is no accounting for these photographic
and surface marks by any normal explanation.

It will be noticed that these surface marks coincide somewhat with the lines in Fig. 140, p. 73
(Reversed right to left).
January 21st, 1928.—:Vlr. Hope held two pairs of naked plates, back to
back, between his hands in the dark-room.
Result : a large blob of affected silver on two of the plates.
Mr Hope exposed two of Mr. Stephenson's plates on him.
(25) As regards the two plates
which had been exposed upon
Mr. Stephenson, these bore Nos.
1 and 4. No. 1 had two Extra
faces upon it, more or less alike.
No. 4 had no Extra. The print
from No. l is illustrated here
(Fig. 142). On the viewer's left
hand side of the larger face there
is dark shading. When this shading
is examined with a lens, marked
X 10, cross lines are seen upon it
which remind one of coarse FiH- 141 Fig- 143
webbing. This is difficult to reproduce by a block (an attempt has been made
Fig. 143), as all half-tone blocks have cross-lines themselves, which are necessary
to produce light and shade. The cross lines on the print itself are not like
half-tone screen marks such as l have noticed in many Deane photographs.*
However, many kinds of screen marks are used by block-makers, especially in
photogravure work. If the photographic lens used to reproduce this picture
were slightly out of focus the little dots might have a different appearance when
reproduced from what they have in the original. It is therefore impossible
to come to any deﬁnite conclusion as to the real nature of the original marks.
It is suggested by some students of Psychic Photography that the apparent
screen marks upon Extras are caused by the process employed by the invisible
operator to produce the Extra. In the meantime we must assume that the
screen marks are in the Extras because they were already in an original which
was employed for reproduction, normally or supernormally. There are screen
" See Fig. 49, p. 23.
Page 76' Figs. 144 and 145 Pars. (250) to (26) HOPE-STEPHENSON.
marks on a number of Mrs. Deane's Extras. These were undoubtedly on
some at least of the originals used. See p. 23. The presence of screen marks
on Extras is indeed a puzzle. They were on a Hope Extra obtained at a
test sitting supervised by the then Glasgow manager of the Kodak Co., who took
two professional photographers with him for the purpose.* In addition I possess
an Extra which is the unmistakable likeness of a well known Glasgow man
(then deceased) which bears screen marks. No such natural picture of him
existed, screen marked or otherwise. The medium was a Mrs. Grant.
(254) In addition to the Extras on the exposed plate No. 1, there are a number
of brush-like marks of the same character as those noted on plates of December
of last year. There are a few similar marks on plate No. 4 which was exposed
but bore no Extra.
May 25th, 1928,—-Of several plates sent by me to Mr. Stephenson two were
exposed upon him by Mr. Hope. Mr. Stephenson wrote me :—
(25b) The second plate was exposed farlonger than is usual. I asked the reason.
.Mr. Hope said they did not take any notice or consider time, but had some kind
of intuition as to when the shutter should be lowered.
The plates were sent to me in London and were developed in my presence by
my professional photographer.
(25;) No Extra upon the two exposed plates, but they bear ﬁnger-marks and
ﬁne lines, as if made by a brush. Mr. Stephenson assured me that Mr. Hope
did not touch the plates. He had no opportunity to do so. Mr. Stephenson
assured me that he himself put no ﬁnger-mark on either plate, yet plate No. 12
has distinct linger-marks in many places. As to plate No. 11, the marks on this
are brush-like, except a couple of distinct ﬁnger-marks on two borders of the
plate. The ﬁnger-marks are not such as a ﬁnger would make unless the ﬁnger
bore some material on its surface. The brush marks form a portion of a ring.
July 21“, 1928,—I sent Mr. Stephenson six packets each containing two
plates numbered and initialled by me. After the usual ceremony, the packet
containing plates numbered 1 and 2 was held by Mrs. Buxton to her forehead ;
Plates numbered 7, 8, 9 and 10 were exposed upon Mr. Stephenson.
Mr. Stephenson wrote me the same day :—
(26)
“
Mrs. Buxton remarked while holding plates No. l and No. 2 to her
forehead,
0
I seem to feel something like brushes working.' [Not a word had been

HOPE-STEPHENSON. Par. (26a) Fig. 144a Page 77
breathed to Mr. Hope or Mrs. Buxton of the brown brush marks I am
ﬁnding on the plates]
Although Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton know my visits are on your behalf,
when I mentioned your great desire to ﬁnd out something about the means
employed to produce the results obtained, Mr. Hope said he was afraid they
were not very interested.
I am prepared to swear that the plates which were exposed were
untouched by either Hope or myself, except at the edges, and then only by
myself, who put them into the slides.
[1,
F.W.W., had called Mr. Stephenson's
particular attention to the marks on the plates of the previous sitting]
I
examined Mr. Hope's camera."
The exposed plates were developed in London by my photographer in my
presence. Plate No.
8
showed one Extra face (Fig. 144, page 76) and in addition
some ﬁne lines on the surface of the gelatine, as
if
done with
a
ﬁne, stifﬁsh brush.
These marks have come out to some extent in the print. They are seen clearly in
the illustration (Fig. 144a below) made by photographing
a
reﬂection of them.
There
is
an indication in the marks of
a
circle.
No. 10 showed two Extra faces, (Fig. 145, page 76), both alike and similar
to the one on plate No.
8.
This plate also bore numerous ﬁne brush-like lines.
These markings are very strange.
One cannot conceive how they
came on the plates normally. The
only conclusion one can arrive at
is
that they came in the process of
the operator's working on the
plates. The question is: who
was the operator
?
From Mr.
Stephenson's report and subsequent
verbal assurance to me, there was
no opportunity for the marks to
have been put on by Mr. Hope.
The other two plates bore no
Extra and no marks on the gelatine.
Mr. Stephenson wrote me that all
four plates were treated alike.
October 20th, 1928,—Six packets each with two quarter-plates numbered
and initialled by me were posted by me to Mr. Stephenson. Mr. Stephenson
reported :—
“
Plates 1—8 in their unopened wrappings were used for skotographs
by holding between hands.
Four plates were used in Mr. Hope's camera, which
I
examined as
usual. Plates Nos.
9
and 10 were handled by me alone
;
Mr. Hope did not
touch either of them.
I
carried the slide from the dark-room to the camera.
Mr. Hope put the slide in and took
it
out of the camera
I
carried
it
to the
dark-room to remove the plates to send them to you.
Plates Nos. 11 and 12 were put into the slide by Mr. Hope. After
exposure
I
carried the slide to the dark-room to remove the plates to send
them to you. Mr. Hope pressed one of my ﬁngers on one of the plates he
put into the slide. He did not explain with what object he did this.
When the photographs were taken Mr. Hope stood alone by the camera.
Mrs. Buxton held
a
curtain to screen the sun off me, the sitter.
At no time was either slide out of my view, except when in the camera."
Page 78 Figs. 146 and 147 Par. (26b) HOPE-STEPHENSON.
(264) All the plates were sent to me, and I took them as received to a professional
photographer, and I saw them developed. No. 9 had nothing unusual. No. 10
had an extra face on the sitter's breast, with some cloudy effect round the
sitter's head (Fig. 146). No. 11 had an Extra face on the sitter's shoulder
(Fig. 147); the same face as that on No. 10. No. 12 had nothing abnormal.
Nos. 9 and 10 made up one packet. Nos. 11 and 12 made up another packet.
The two plates which bore Extras were at no time together. No. 11 was
handled by Hope. No. 10 (Fig. 146) was not touched by Hope at all. None
of the plates bore any ﬁnger or brush marks.
Fig. 146 Fig. 147
November 17th, 1928,—I sent Mr. Stephenson a dozen quarter-plates, all
numbered and initialled by me, made up in six packets of two each, wrapped in
black paper. The packets were numbered outside with the numbers corresponding
to those on the plates inside.
Mr. Stephenson wrote me as follows :—
“
Except whilst in the slide not one of the plates was out of my sight
for one moment, and those used in the camera were not touched by anyone
but myself, and I only held them by the edges. Any ﬁnger or other marks
which may appear were not put on in a normal way at Crewe. Mr. Hope
took the plates in the slide from the dark-room to the camera, I walking
with him, and that was the only time the plates were not actually in my
possession." .
Mr. Stephenson posted all the plates off to me on that day. I took them
to a professional photographer and saw them developed.
As regards the unexposed plates (eight used for skotographs) nothing came
upon them at all on development, and there were no ﬁnger or other marks.
Of the plates used for exposures, Nos. 9 and 10 formed one pair in the
double slide or carrier; Nos. 11 and 12 another pair.
(26b) On development No. 9 showed a geometrical pattern and an Extra face
(Fig. l48,page 79); No. 10 showed a geometrical pattern only (Fig. 149, page 79).
Both the plates showed brush-like marks of a brown colour on the gelatine.
These marks do not correspond with the developed images.
HOPE-STEPHENSON. Par. (27) Figs. 148 and 149 Page 79
Nos. 11 and 12 on development showed nothing abnormal, and neither had
a trace of the brush-like marks All four plates were treated alike, and, as
Mr. Stephenson reported to me, were touched by him alone and then only on the
edges.
I have examined two or three thousand of Mrs. Deane's plates and have
never found marks on them remotely suggesting these peculiar marks, and
Mrs. Deane does not handle or keep her used plates with much care.
The geometrical ﬁgures suggest the movement of spots of light.
Fig. 148 Fig. 149
(27) December 15th, 1928,—A few days before the 15th I forwarded my
camera to Blackpool to Mr. Stephenson, with the request to him to familiarise
himself thoroughly with it. He had already used it once previously at Hope's.
I forwarded to Crewe, by registered post, addressed to Mr. Stephenson, c/o
G.P.O., three of the camera slides, each containing two plates dated and
numbered C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, and initialled by me; also three packets of
two plates, each wrapped in black paper, Nos. I and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, with
the corresponding numbers on the outside of the packets. These latter were to
be used for skotographs.
Mr. Stephenson reported to me as follows :—
"
I collected the parcel from the Post Ofﬁce and proceeded to
144, Market Street. I found Mr. Hope there. He informed me that
Mrs. Buxton was unwell. Mr. Hope and I were alone on this occasion.
I took with me my bag which contained the camera with the black cloth
Mr. Warrick had sent me, and the parcel containing the slides and the
packet of plates for skotographs. I deposited the bag on a chair and it
was never out of my presence.
Mr. Hope and I had the usual ceremony. We placed the slides and
packets of plates upon the centre of the table. We sat round and put our
hands upon the table, and Mr. Hope offered up a prayer. I can positively
assert that my bag was never in a position for a third person to abstract
a slide from it without my knowledge.
I gave Mr. Hope one packet, namely, that marked 3 and 4, for a skoto
graphic experiment. He held the packet between his hands for a minute
or two. I then put this packet with the others for skotographs into the
box, and put the box into my bag.
Immediately after this experiment I put the three slides into my pocket,
and Mr. Hope and I proceeded to the outhouse. The usual rough cloth back
ground was hanging up. I examined it and went behind it. I then rigged
Page 80 Figs. 150 and 151 Par. (27a) HOPE-STEPHENSON.
up Mr. Warrick's camera. I myself put the slides into the camera, starting
with Nos. 1 and 2, and following it by 3 and 4, then by 5 and 6. I myself
pulled the shutter of each slide out. All Mr. Hope did was to remove the cap
from the lens and replace it. Mr. Hope did not handle the camera or the
slides at all. Mr. Hope stood at the side of the camera opposite my left hand.
He did not place his hand on the camera or over the camera. I removed
the slide myself from the camera and wrapped each slide in its black paper
and placed it in my pocket. The slides were kept in my pocket while I took
my leave of Mr. Hope, which I did very shortly after the last exposure was
made. There. was no opportunity at all for anybody to remove anything
from my pocket.
I then proceeded to the Post Ofﬁce and made up a parcel of the slides
and plates and forwarded them that day, 15th, by registered post, to
Mr. Warrick in London."
On the 17th of December, 1928 (Monday) the registered parcel from Crewe
came to hand. I took it unopened to Mr. Dennis, a professional photographer,
in the evening.
First, he treated the plates Nos. 3 and 4, which had been used for skotographs.
On developing nothing came upon them and no ﬁnger or other marks were
apparent.
Fig. 150 Fig. r51
Mr. Dennis then proceeded to develop the plates contained in the three slides
or holders. First, be dealt with slide No. C1 and C2. On No. Cl plate an Extra
came up very quickly, much before the sitter, who was Mr. Stephenson. The
development was continued up to four minutes, and the Extra went very dark.
It shows a clear face and two blurs of the same face, see illustration (Fig. 150).
On C2 no Extra appeared.
(27a) Next, Mr. Dennis proceeded with No. C3 and C4. An Extra came on
No. C4; also before the sitter appeared, but not so rapidly as did the ﬁrst Extra.
This last Extra was larger than the ﬁrst one and turned out to be a large, broad,
oval band, say, ﬁ-in. thick, Il-in.wide, and 2§-in. long, with two blobs in it and a
clear face within it (Fig. 151). In the substance of the band is a clear face
exactly like the face within the band and one other deﬁnite face very similar,
but not so clear, and a third blurred suggestion of a similar face. The Extra
face in No. C4 is the same as the Extra face in No. Cl. There are abundant
HOPE-STEPHENSON. Page 8]
brush marks on the gelatine of both plates. In one (C1) the brush marks form
part of a ring, about 1" in diameter. Nothing Extra appeared on C3. The other
four exposed plates show no lines on the gelatine at all. Mr. Dennis has
signed my report (as here given) of the development proceedings.
On developing exposed plates Nos. C5 and C6, nothing Extra appeared upon
either of them.
In view of the conditions of this day's experiments the results obtained
are, in my opinion, a valuable addition to the many proofs obtained by others*
of the appearance of Extras on plates in Mr. Hope's presence by some unknown
means other than fraud.
My own camera and plates were used as detailed.
Mr. Stephenson has had much experience at sittings at Crewe, and is very
familiar with the surroundings, and is therefore well trained for the particular
experiments as regards observing all occurrences.
lilr. Hope and Mr. Stephenson were alone.
The slides never entered M r. Ho/re's dark-room.
Mr. Hope did not touch the slides.
The’ plates were developed in London by a professional photographer in my
presence.
The registered parcel was ojrened by the photographer in my presence.
Notwithstanding all the above there are abundant brush marks on both plates,
which on one indicate deﬁnitely a circle.

January 12th, 1929.—The proceedings and experiments of December 15th,
1928, were repeated. There was no abnormal result at all, except
a
few
brown brush-like marks on one of the plates used in an unopened packet for
a
skotograph.

April 13th, 1929_—Plates sent by me, Nos. 1 to 6 for exposures, Nos. 7 and
8 (each in a separate packet) for skotographs. One packet for a skotograph was
held unopened by Mrs. Buxton to Mr. Hope's forehead. "I then took both
these packets," wrote Mr. Stephenson, "and put them in my pocket, where they
remained until I packed them."
As regards the exposures—usual vigilance by Mr. Stephenson ; he wrote me :
"
Hope could have done nothing improper to or with the slide or plates without
my knowledge. There is no doubt about this."
I received the registered parcel on the 15th, the Monday following, and
took it, unopened, to my professional photographer, Mr. A. \V. Dennis, who
opened it and dealt with the plates in my presence, but uninterfered with by
me. This gentleman has signed a report from which I am abstracting:
"
On plate No. 1 an Extra appeared
across the sitter's mouth (Fig. 152). There
were brush marks, depicted in Fig. 1523..
The other ﬁve plates had nothing abnormal
upon them, except No. 5, which appears to
have the impression of another face on the top
of Mr. Stephenson's; a slight portion of this
Extra being just outside Mr. Stephenson's face.
This is the only portion of the Extra which can
be distinguished."
(27b) Mr. Dennis then proceeded to develop two
packets marked 7 and 8, which had been used
for skotographs. Mr. Dennis wrote me in his
report as regards these two plates, Nos. 7 and 8.
as follows:
"
On developing these two plates, No. 8
remained blank, but on No. 7 some ﬁne lines _,
appeared like writing. These lines were there, Mg0 :5-'
and in my experience as a professional photographer, they were absolutely
unusual. Plates do not develop these abnormal markings in this manner.
I cannot remember seeing such lines in any of the many plates I have dealt
with, but I have little experience of developing unexposed plates.
On leaving this plate in’ the
developer up to three minutes the
lines did not get any darker at all. [F

May 30th, 1929,—I forwarded on the 29th to Mr. Stephenson, six packets,
each containing two plates, numbered and dated and initialled by me.
Mr. Stephenson took a lady friend with him who assisted in his surveillance.
Usual ceremony round the table, but one feature of the sitting was that
they had more hymns, more prayers, and the plates were given much shorter
exposures than usual.
Mrs. Buxton this time would not try for skotographs, she said it hurt her
head. Six plates were used for exposures.
Mr. Stephenson writes :—‘
"
I took the plates off the table and put them into my pocket. Mrs. de R.,
Mr. Hope, and myself went into the dark-room. I stood next to Mr. Hope
and I opened packet marked No. l and No. 2. Mr. Hope held the book
form slide open, and I put one plate in. He offered the other side and
I put the other plate in with the black card (which I handled with my
ﬁngers) between them. We then went out and the exposure was made
in the usual way. I had the remainder of the plates in my pocket. Mr. Hope,
carried the slide with the plates in it in his trousers pocket to the camera.
This procedure was repeated for the second exposure, but for the third
exposure I went into the dark-room with Mr. Hope alone; Mrs. De R.
remaining with Mrs. Buxton.
No one other than myself touched the plates, no one ﬁngered the plates.
The camera, the slide, the curtain were all of them carefully examined."
Mr. Stephenson sent me these plates immediately by post, and they were
developed by a professional photographer, Mr. Dennis, in my presence, without
interference from me. Mr. Dennis himself opened the registered parcel. Of the
exposed plates, one of them, No. 2, bore two blurred Extra faces (Fig. 154),
No. 3 also had two Extra faces, one rather clear (Fig. 155).
Fig. 154
Both these plates with Extras upon them bore a number of brown
surface marks. In the original photographic print (Fig. 154) one can see very
ﬁne lines running along the curve of the cloud. I have had these surface
marks
photographed and slightly touched up (exceptionally) by the engraver (Fig.
154a). It shows how these lines follow the curve of the cloud and at the end
form a portion of a ring. It seems obvious that these surface marks are

Fig. 155a Fig. 155b
The Sketch (Fig. 155a) is what an artist friend of the author thinks the marks on the left
side of the Fig. 155b suggest, viz., a person sitting for typtology.
the trail of some instrument used for the production of the Extra and yet
according to the evidence in this and other cases reported herein there was
no opportunity for Hope to use such an instrument.
The surface marks on plate No. 3 of
this day do not coincide with the Extra
and are very extensive. I have had a
photograph taken of them (Fig. 155a
above). Is there a design in these ?
On account of these brush marks
appearing of late, I had warned
Mr. Stephenson more than once to be very
careful not to touch the gelatine surface
himself, nor allow anyone else to do so.
These marks are certainly very curious,
and, to my mind, of real importance. I
have either developed or assisted at the
developing of many hundreds of plates,
and have never seen similar marks, nor
has Mr. Dennis, who has dealt with
thousands of plates. Mrs. de R. wrote
Mr. Stephenson :
Fig. 155
"I was very wideawake during the whole proceedings, and have no
hesitation in saying that I can conceive no possible trick or device of which
Mr. Hope could have made use under the conditions to produce the results
obtained. I watched everything very carefully the whole time I was in the
house. I saw you take the plates from theinwrappings in the dark-room.
I saw you initial them and put them in the slides. I noticed that Mr. Hope
HOPE-STEPHENSON. Figs. 156 and 157 Page 85
did not touch the plates Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 (those I saw inserted) at any
period either before or after the photographs were taken. There was, in
fact, no stage in the proceedings where Mr. Hope's every movement was not
carefully watched by me during the use of the ﬁrst two packets containing
plates Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4. [On Nos. 2 and 3 Extras appeared.]"
June 14th, 1929,—I forwarded to Mr. Stephenson six packages, each
containing two plates and some pieces of plain cartridge paper measuring 8-in.
>< 5-in. I instructed Mr. Stephenson to request Mr. Hope to hold the cartridge
paper between his hands in the dark-room, just as a favour to me, informing
him that Mrs. Deane had obtained, many times, brown marks upon paper
held between her hands, even inside between two leaves. I was prompted to
make this experiment with .\Ir. Hope as the brush-like marks alluded to fre
quently by me, as found on some of my plates used recently with Mr. Hope,
show a distinct brown colour, and the marks appearing on paper in my Deane
experiments are also brown. It occurred to me that the operator, whoever he
is, could put this brown substance on paper as well as on the plate. But in
psychic research one meets with unusual difﬁculties. Mr. Hope would do nothing
with the paper. He was most emphatic in his refusal. He said they (Mr. Hope
and Mrs. Buxton) had been told by their guide to touch no work other than
photographic, and nothing would induce them to try anything else."
Fig. 156 Fig. 157
Mr. Stephenson forwarded me the plates. They were developed by Mr. Dennis,
as usual, in my presence. Two of them showed cloudy results. In one of these two
a face appeared on the sitter's neck (F
ig.
156 above) The other
is
uninterest
ing (Fig. 157 above). There are no brush-like marks on any of these plates.
August 4th, 1929.—I sent Mr. Stephenson six quarter-plates numbered
and initialled by me. They were in pairs,
1
and
2,
3
and
4,
5
and
6.
In
addition
I
sent two packets numbered 11 and 12, which contained each only
a
plain piece of paper, quarter-plate size. These papers were sent with
a
view to
obtaining marks upon the paper such as
I
obtained through Mrs. Deane.
.\’Ir. Stephenson reported to me as follows :—
"
The plates were used as per your instructions, that
is,
in the order of
1
and
2,
3
and
4,
5
and
6.
Nos. 11 and 12 containing paper were on the
table between
3
and
4
and
5
and
6,
and were held with the plates between
all our hands during the sitting at the table. After the sitting
I
got Mr. Hope
to put the packet containing 11 and 12 inside his coat pocket.
Page 86 F1'g,]I58 Pars. (28a) tor(28b)
HOPE-STEPHENSON.
By the way, Hope mentioned that if you wanted results from skotos,
the best way was for you to wrap up two plates and to sleep with them
under your pillow for a period as long as six months, and to concentrate
each night on the desired result. He said Archdeacon Colley tried this
method with great success. He had his plates wrapped in tin foil and sealed.
The sitting was carried through in the usual manner. I had the plates,
either in my pocket or in sight for the whole period, barring when they were
in the slides. I examined the curtain (background), also the camera and
the slides. I put the plates into the slides myself, taking each packet from
my pocket in the dark-room. After I had taken the exposed plates from the
slide, I re-wrapped them in the black paper and returned them to my pocket.
(28a) I wanted Mr. Hope to hold the naked paper between his hands for
ﬁfteen minutes, but Mr. Hope was unwilling
to try any such experiment, asserting that
his guide wished him to conﬁne his psychic
work to photography."
The plates and packets 11 and 12 were
posted to me by Mr. Stephenson, and the plates
were developed by my professional photo
grapher in my presence, who opened the parcel
himself.
Nothing abnormal appeared on plates 2, 4,
5 and 6, and nothing was on the two papers.
Number 3 plate bore an Extra face without
any surrounding material. There were no
streaks or marks on the gelatine of this or the
four plates 2, 4, 5 and 6.
(28441) No. 1 plate had a wee cloud Extra and
the gelatine bore a quantity of brown marks.
These I have had photographed by reﬂected ,
light (Fig. 158).
F‘g- o58
August 28th, 1929.—I sent to Mr. Stephenson twelve quarter-plates
numbered and initialled by me as usual. Eight plates were exposed in
Mr. Hope's camera.
Mr. Stephenson's report to me was as follows :—
"Eight plates were exposed upon me. The procedure was as usual."
The plates were posted to me by Mr. Stephenson and were developed by
my photographer as usual ; result : nothing abnormal on any one of the plates.
November 23rd, 1929,—I did not send the plates to Mr. Stephenson for
this sitting.
Mr. Stephenson reported to me as follows :—
"I bought the plates at the shop of Mr. Cumming, Chemist, Crewe.
Four of the plates were exposed in the camera; other two were held. un
covered, in the dark-room with Mrs. Buxton.
The procedure was as usual ; neither Mr. Hope nor Mrs. Buxton touched
the plates used in the camera, and I only held them by the edges. I put
the plates into the slides myself, as I always do. I initialled them."
Mr. Stephenson posted the packet of plates to me.
(28b) The parcel was opened by my usual photographer in my presence, the
plates were developed by him in front of me. Only one plate (an exposed one)
bore an abnormal result, viz. : three blobs, two with the words Gustav Gele
across them (Fig. 160) ; evidently portions of the words Gustave Geley of the
Institut Métapsychique International. The handwriting resembles the late
Pars. (286b) (28c) Figs. 160 and 160:: Page 87
Miss Scatcherd's. It will be remembered that Dr. Geley's face appeared
as an Extra at Crewe, at a sitting held by Mr. Stanley De Brath, Miss Scatcherd
and another lady on the day and hour appointed for the sitting with Dr. Geley,
whom the sad accident causing his death prevented from attending. Were the
. words abstracted (by the operator) from a letter of Miss Scatcherd to Mr. Hope?
On the surface of the gelatine there are decided ring marks round all of
these blobs somewhat similar to those recorded in (28cc) and (28d) below,
which see. Also other ﬁne line marks (see Fig. 160a).
Fig. 100 Fig. 160a
Fig. 160a is a reproduction of a sketch of the marks found on the surface of the
gelatine of (28b) Fig. 160, showing indications of a ring round each Extra (blotches B).
(28b1,) CommenL—These marks are evidently traces left by the instrument
used (by whom?) to put on the blotches.
January 18th, 1930; -I sent Mr. Stephenson eight quarter-plates dated
and initialled by me. The proceedings at Crewe were as usual. All eight plates
were exposed on Mr. Stephenson.
The plates were forwarded to me by Mr. Stephenson for development.
As to six of them nothing abnormal was on any one of these. On each of the
remaining two appeared a small blob of reduced silver. Each of these two
plates had a small mark on the gelatine as if made with a brush. These marks
are really very curious. They are not accidental. I have never met with such
elsewhere, nor has my photographer. Mr. Stephenson assures me no one at
Crewe had any opportunity of putting the blobs or the marks on the plates.
January 25th, 1930.—I had sent Mr. Stephenson my camera with three
double slides, each ﬁlled by me with two quarter-plates, dated and initialled by
me. Mr. Hope used my camera and slides and exposed all six plates on
Mr. Stephenson.
Mr. Stephenson had possession of the slides all the time, before and after
they were inserted in the camera. He returned the slides to me.
(28c) My photographer developed the plates in my presence in London. Only
one of the six was abnormally affected. It had a cloud of reduced silver,
li-in. X l}-in. The gelatine surface bore some of the strange marks (very
few but deﬁnite). The plate was not even seen by Mr. Hope. My camera
and slides were used. All Mr. Hope did was to raise the shutter. Such is
Mr. Stephenson's report to me.
March 29211, 1930,—I sent to Mr. Stephenson twelve quarter-plates dated,
numbered and initialled by me. Eight of these (l-8) were exposed upon
Mr. Stephenson in Mr. Hope's camera. Four were used for skotographs by
being held in their wrappings between the hands of the circle.
Page 88 Figs. 161a to 164a Pars. (28cc) (28ccc)
Fig. 164a
Mr. Stephenson forwarded all the plates to me
the same day by registered post, and I saw them
developed by a professional photographer, Mr. Dennis.
(28mm) The results were : skotographs, nil. Of the
exposed plates Nos. 2 and 4 had abnormal effects
in the silver ; No. 2 a face (Fig. 161) ; No. 4 a large
blob or cloud ll-in. X I§-in. Both of these bore, in
addition, brown surface marks; No. 4 a few un
interesting marks. In No. 2 the brown surface marks
formed a ring encircling the Extra face. This ring
has been photographed by reﬂected light (see Fig.
161a above). The ring is just visible in Fig. 161.
The position of the ring in relation to the Extra
suggests that the brown marks were made by some
apparatus used in the production of the Extra.
Apparatus must in any case have been used to produce
these Extras, either by Hope himself or some other
agency. It must be remembered that similar Extras

appeared when Hope had no opportunity to touch the plate. Compare this
ring with those of Figs. 163a and 164a, p. 88. Mr. Stephenson wrote me :—
"
I can assure you that I alone touched any of the plates ; and then only
the edge of each plate. The plates were put into my pocket as soon as
I had taken them from the slide and wrapped them in black paper. No
plates were left anywhere before or after exposure. They were in my pocket
all the time until packed for post."
Mr. Stephenson was mentally suggesting that a lily should appear upon
one of the plates, or the word Lily. During the proceedings Mrs. Buxton said,
"
I can see a large spray of lilies in a kind of cloud."
April 26th, 1930,—I dated,numbered, and initialled twelve quarter-plates.
Mr. Stephenson took them with him from London. He was accompanied at
the sitting by a friend of his, Mrs. de R. Plates Nos. l-8 were in my slides and
exposed in my camera. Result, nil. Three further plates exposed in Hope's.
Mr. Stephenson forwarded the plates
to me the same day by post, registered,
and I saw them developed by a professional
photographer, Mr. Dennis. There was no
result on the plate held for a skotograph.
Of the other three plates one bore an Extra
(Fig. 162). There are no surface marks on
this or any of the other eleven plates.
May 10th, I930.—I forwarded to
Mr. Stephenson, addressed to G.P.O. Crewe,
twelve quarter-plates, dated, numbered, and
initialled by me.
All the twelve were exposed on
Mr. Stephenson by Mr. Hope, Mrs. Buxton
assisting. Nothing abnormal came on any
one of them.
May 24th, 1930,—I sent by post to Mr. Stephenson to G.P.O., Chester,
my camera, with four double slides each with two quarter-plates; and four
additional quarter-plates ; all dated, numbered and initialled by me. The
whole of the plates were exposed by Mr. Hope; the four extra plates in
Mr. Hope's camera; Mrs. Buxton was present. Mr. Stephenson wrote me :—
"
The four extra plates were used in Hope's camera after being initialled
by myself whilst they were in the slide in the dark-room. These plates
were only handled by the edges." All plates were developed in London.
(28d) The result was: only one plate was affected
abnormally. It was one of the plates exposed
in Hope's camera. It bore an extra face (Fig.
163) and encircling this extra face is a brown ring
on the gelatine (Fig. 163a, p. 88).
As mentioned on the preceding page con
cerning a similar ring it suggests apparatus used
for the Extra. Mr. Fred Barlow has pointed out
the possibility of producing, by means of discs
bearing luminous paint,* Extras identical in
character with most of those obtained in recent
years at Crewe, of which many are illustrated in
this chapter. There is no evidence that Mr. Hope
ever knew of such means. I have experimented
with success with a luminous paint disc as far as
* See p. 61.
Page 90 Fig. 164 Pars. (28c) to (28g) HOPE-STEPHENSON.
Extras are concerned but even when used naked, that is, direct on the sensitive
ﬁlm, it produced no mark on the surface, brown or otherwise, though I exerted
some pressure. The surface ring marks found by me, depicted on p. 88, would
surely require a disc too large for concealment under the conditions prevailing.
June 14th, 1930,—I sent to Mr. Stephenson by post to Chester twelve
quarter-plates dated, numbered, and initialled by me. Mr. Stephenson wrote
me on June 14th :—
“
I forwarded to you to-day, by registered post, the plates received from
you this morning. You will note that only six plates have been used—
1 to 6.
Mr. Hope did not touch any of the plates, and I was most careful to
handle them only by the edges. I can swear that no one put a ﬁnger on
the surface of any plate.
With regard to the slides Mr. Hope is quite willing for you to send your
own.
I impressed upon Mr. Hope that I did not want to be so much in the
picture, but he only smiled. By the way, he told me that some time ago he
got a message in Yiddish on a plateahe could not read it, neither could
the sitter, but her husband could."
(28¢) I took the plates to my professional photographer and saw them developed.
The result was four blobs only on one plate (not illustrated) and some brown
marks on the gelatine.
June 28th, 1930.—A sitting with no abnormal result.
July 26th, 1930,—I sent Mr. Stephenson twelve quarter-plates dated,
numbered and initialled by me as usual.
.\lr. Stephenson wrote me that the twelve plates were used in Mr. Hope's0
camera; Mrs. Buxton also was present. Mr. Stephenson
supervised as carefully as on previous occasions. I need not
repeat the details. Mr. Stephenson added :—
"There is not the slightest possible doubt that the
surfaces of the plates were not touched by anyone."
(28!) Mr. Stephenson posted the plates to me the same day
and I took the unopened registered parcel to my photographer,
who opened it and developed the plates in my presence. Only
one had an Extra (Fig. 164). This plate bore many marks
on the gelatine, among them a ring round the Extra face.
The marks have been photographed by reﬂected light and
are illustrated (Fig. 164a, page 88). These marks have not
affected the silver, hence the necessity of photographing them
by reﬂected light. Compare this ring with those of Figs. 161a
and 163a, page 88. In addition to the rings are three or four
ﬁnger-marks. There are similar marks on several of the other
plates exposed to-day ; these bear no Extra and no ring.
From November 1930 to May 1932, eleven resultless sittings were held,
eighty-two plates being used. These sittings are omitted. There was nothing
unusual about them to render them worth reporting. The conditions were
similar to those of the many already detailed sittings.
(288) May 30th, 193L—Mr. Stephenson reported to me :—
"
Eight plates used. Four of them were supplied by a professional
photographer at Chester and put by him into two of your double slides.
The remaining four were in your slides, loaded by you.
Fig. 164
HOPE-STEPHENSON. Figs. 165 and 165A Page 91
The procedure was as usual (Mrs. Buxton was present) and there was not the
slightest opportunity for Hope to do anything to the plates. Your slides were
placed by Hope in his camera, which they ﬁtted by means of an adaptor."
Mr. Stephenson forwarded all the plates to me by parcel post. 1 took them
to my professional photographer, who developed them in my presence. On
only one of them did an Extra appear. The plate bearing this Extra was a
plate numbered. dated and initialled by me, and put into my slide by me at
my ofﬁce.
To-day the plates and slides were not taken into the dark-room at Crewe
at all.
Fig. 165 Fig. 165A
The Extra (Fig. 165) is very curious. The details do not come out in
Fig. 165 ; they are shown in the sketch made from it, Fig. 165A. On the sitter's
wrist are to be seen the words in type as shown and on his breast the imperfect
word Cr(aw)for(d) in handwriting like that of the late Dr. Crawford. The
printed and written letters are white, that is clear glass, in reverse, in the negative.
On june 7th Mr. Stephenson wrote me :—
“
I am quite unable to account for the Extra, but I can tell you we all
concentrated upon getting some message from Dr. Crawford."
On jmie 17th Mr. Stephenson wrote me :—
"
Your slide holding the plate bearing the Extra never left my possession,
and the band you put round it was not broken until I handed the slide to
Mr. Hope to insert in his camera.
I cannot make any suggestion as to how the black patch and the printing
got on to the plate. Hope exposed the plate longer than usual, about one
minute, and then handed the slide back to me.
I have already mentioned the fact that we all concentrated on getting
some message from Dr. Crawford."
On june 18th, I asked Mr. Stephenson by letter who started the idea of
concentrating on Dr. Crawford at the sitting of May 30th last, and added :—
"
You will see from the copy of a letter enclosed, which I received from
a friend, that he has discovered the letters
"
Cr
"
on the right lapel of your
coat and letters
“
for
"
on the breast of your waistcoat, both in Dr. Crawford's
handwriting."
Page 92 Pars. (28]!) to (28k) HOPE-STEPHENSON.
On june 19th, Mr. Stephenson wrote me that the idea of concentrating on
Dr. Crawford was his own, and added :—
“
Before you called my attention to it (in your letter of yesterday) I had
no idea part of his name is to be seen on the print."
I would draw the reader's attention to the fact that if Mr. Hope had not
allowed me to handle this plate all the interesting features of this photograph
would have been left undiscovered.
(28h) Comment : The plate bearing portions of the word Crawford was not
taken into the dark-room. Mr. Hope had no opportunity to put the word
Crawford on it. It was Mr. Stephenson who suggested the persons present should
concentrate on Crawford. This was a surprise suggestion. As regards the
large dark cloud or ring, a friend has suggested to me it was caused by photo-
graphing a folded newspaper with a circular hole. The photograph shows
sharp edges of what may have served as a handle or support for the newspaper
ring. But there are loose threads at the edges of the ring, which are evidence
against the newspaper theory. Besides, the type in such a photograph would
have come out too small to be distinguishable. One might think the Extra
was produced by the plate being in contact with a piece of printed paper and that
the printed type had produced the white lettering in the negative, but experi
ments I made proved that prolonged contact with a printed page only a few days
old had no effect upon the sensitive ﬁlm and that the ink of freshly printed
paper under pressure reduced the silver salt in the sensitive ﬁlm so that, on
developing, the letters came out black and not white in the negative. The only
explanation which seems to ﬁt the case is that a transparency or a negative was
used. But by whom? A piece of paper more or less transparent printed on
one side only might act the part of a negative, and light passing through it on to
the plate would produce blurred white letters. If the paper were printed on
both sides the printing would not come out so clear as it is in the original Hope
Stephenson negative, but, as I have said, there was no opportunity to place
such a piece of paper in position, and then one has to account for the appearance
of the word
“
Crawford."
(2281') July 3rd, 1931,—0n this day Mr. Stephenson wrote me :—
“I am sending you for development eight plates received from you,
which were exposed by Hope this afternoon at Crewe. The plates, numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, were put into and taken out of the slides in total darkness. Hope
requests you to develop these plates in the dark as an experiment. The
other four plates were treated in the ordinary way and on one of the two
plates in the slides which I have marked, Hope thinks Dr. Crawford may
appear. [This did not happen]. Hope says he is quite certain that
Dr. Crawford was with us this afternoon."
On july 7th I wrote Mr. Stephenson that my photographer developed plates
Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 in my presence in the dark; the other four in the light.
On number 2 appeared some writing upside-down to the sitter. Unfortunately
the sitter's body obliterates most of the wording; but "W. J. Crawford
"
is
fairly distinct, and
“
Belf
”
(for Belfast) and the word "psychic
”
(Fig. 166
X“). On the other seven nothing abnormal appeared.
(28k) Comment—This plate having been loaded into the slide in the dark, the
only evidential value resides in the handwriting, which is certainly very similar
to that of the late Dr. Crawford. I append a specimen of Dr. Crawford's
handwriting taken from a letter he wrote me in 1920 (Fig. 167). Compare
the signatures and the
“
pur
”
in the Extra with the ﬁrst syllable of the word
"
purposely
"
in his letter. Among Dr. Crawford's many letters to me I have
not found one capital B similar to that in the Extra.

January 9th, 1932*To-day Mr. Stephenson was accompanied by two ladies
(Mrs. de Rome and Mrs. Read) interested in psychic photography.
Mr. Stephenson wrote me, january 10th, as follows :—
“
Mr. Hope asked the ladies whether they had brought any plates.
They had not. Mr. Hope then said he had an unopened packet of plates
at home and would fetch it and let Mr. Stephenson examine and open the
packet, pick out any two plates to be exposed, and a third plate to be
developed with the others to prove that all the plates were blank before
exposure. Mr. Hope fetched the packet; the two ladies and I examined
it and agreed that the packet had not been opened. I took the packet of
plates into the darkroom and chose the second and third plates for exposure
and took the ﬁfth plate for development without its being exposed.
After the two plates had been exposed by Mr. Hope on the ladies and
myself I took them out of the slide in the dark-room and put them in my
pocket.
I then ﬁlled the slide with two of your plates. Mr. Hope exposed these
upon us. I developed all four plates in the dark-room there and then.
(281) You will see there is an Extra face and some writing (similar
to that of the late Dr. Crawford) (Fig. 168).
On one of your two plates developed by me there is an Extra face.
Fig. 168
The writing has been intensiﬁed by the blockniaker.
A further six of your plates were inserted by me into Mr. Hope's slides
and were exposed upon us under the usual precautions. I have sent these
six plates to you for development.”
I took the six plates to my photographer, who developed them in my
presence. Two of them have each an Extra face. One of these Extra faces
HOPE-STEPHENSON Pars. (28m) (28a) Fig 169 Page 95
is the same as that which appeared on one of my plates developed by
Mr. Stephenson at Crewe. One of these plates has two deﬁnite ring marks, the
other a faint trace of one.
The Extra on the plate bearing the Crawford writing has been recognised
by one of the lady sitters as the likeness of a brother (deceased) of an intimate
friend of her own, and this friend conﬁrms it as being a portrait of her brother.
Shortly after the sitting of January 9th Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton visited
Southport, where they gave sittings. Mrs. de Rome, who was present at
Crewe on January 9th with Mr. Stephenson, when handwriting like Dr. Crawford's
appeared, reported to Mr. Stephenson that twelve exposures made by Mr. Hope
at the Southport sitting produced twelve Extras.
(28m) Mrs. de Rome stated that she put one of her own plates into an
empty box and held it herself to the forehead of Mrs. Buxton. On it appeared
a white cloud-like mass ll-in. x l-in., on which were written the following words
in the handwriting of the late Dr. W. J. Crawford f' Dear Fri[end] Stephenson
have been much struck with results obtained W. ]. Crawford." Mrs. de Rome
witnessed the development Mr. Hope did not touch the plalc af all (Fig. 169).
Fig. 169
June 18th, 1932—1 sent Mr. Stephenson my camera and three double slides,
each ﬁlled with two plates initialled and dated by me. Mr. Stephenson
reported to me that Mr. Hope used my camera and slides, exposing my six
plates on Mr. S. and that none of my slides went into the dark-room.
They were returned to me by Mr. Stephenson and I saw them developed
by my photographer in London.
(28“) One of the six plates bore an Extra. At the top of this plate there
was a dark band l}-inches wide showing that the shutter had been pulled up
that amount in daylight. Within this band were the Extra and some ﬁnger
marks. (Fig. 170 overleaf). The other ﬁve plates from my slides bore no ﬁnger
marks and no Extra.
Six other plates dated and initialled by me were used in Mr. Hope's slide
and camera, Mr. Stephenson placing the plates in the slides. He assures me
the surfaces of them were not touched. He sent them to me to be developed.
Two of these bore Extra faces, one of the faces being the same as the Extra face
on the plate exposed in one of the slides of my own camera. These last two
plates bearing Extras also bore ﬁnger-marks, one of them a great quantity,
Page 96 Fig. I 70 Par. (28o) HOPE-STEPHENSON
the production of which by the touching of the surface of
the plate0could not
have passed unobserved by Mr. Stephenson, who gives special attention to this
point. The four plates of this series which bore no Extra bore no ﬁnger-marks
either.
Fig. 170
It is difﬁcult to believe that this pulling up of the shutter
(28.)) Comment
was not a deliberate conscious act. Mr. Stephenson is sure any such action
would have been seen by him. See the Appendix, p.357 (372).
The experiments conducted by Mr. Stephenson at Crewe had not as their
object the proof of the genuineness of psychic photography—this has already
been proved* to the satisfaction of all (with the exception mentioned at the
beginning of this chapter) who have carried out prolonged investigations in this
subject—but rather to collect new facts which might lead to a solution of the
great problem. This object has been to some extent gained by Mr. Stephenson
being allowed by Mr. Hope to retain possession of many of the plates used in the
experiments.
Many of these plates have been found to bear surface marks, some of them
indicating a circle or circles. The obvious conclusion to be drawn from these
surface marks is that they are evidence of the application of the apparatus used
by the operator to put the pictures on to the plates.
How the apparatus was used and by whom cannot be decided by guessing ;
it will be decided one of these days by the accumulation of more facts.
If Mr. Stephenson's stressed assertions given me immediately after most
sittings (backed by that of Mrs. de Rome in the case of (28) p. 83) that Mr. Hope
did not touch the plates at all, be accepted, it is difﬁcult to conceive how any
apparatus which caused the extensive brush marks and large rings—see the
large marks p.70 Fig. 135a and pp. 74 and 75 Figs. 141a and 140a—could
have been applied by Hope without detection ; in addition, one has to account
for the extensive surface marks on my plates of 95th Dec. 1928, pp. 79 and 80
(27) Figs. 150, 151, which were exposed in my own camera in my own slides,
* Appendix pp. 380-382
HOPE-STEPHENSON Page 97
which Hope never touched. The same conditions applied when the result of
the 25th January, 1930, was obtained when surface brush marks were on the
sensitive ﬁlm which bore a large Extra, a featureless cloud.
If these marks and Extras were not put consciously by Hope then we must
assume they were put by some invisible operator in some invisible dimension
with some invisible apparatus leaving its marks—a big assumption. Yet my
many results given herein point to the existence, especially with Mrs. Deane,
of such a power originating within or from a source exterior to the medium.
In addition to my own results there are the many obtained by other investigators,
some of which are included in the Appendix.
It may legitimately be argued that if a medium for psychic photography can
be the medium for the extraordinary deﬁnitely non-fraudulent phenomena
recorded of Mrs. Deane in chapter VII it becomes impossible to state with
reference to that medium that any particular apparently fraudulent phenomenon
occurring by his or her inﬂuence is fraudulent ; there is always the possibility
that the 'operator' who is proved capable of such unbelievable things in the
presence of a suitable medium was the author of it. Fraudful appearance in
results is therefore no guide to the origin of them with such mediums.
As incontestably genuine results have been obtained with Mr. Hope the
above argument would apply in his case.
CHAPTER VI.
Mr. George H. Breaker’s skolographic experimenls
wilh Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton.
Chapter V. has dealt with experiments conducted by myself and
Mr. F. McC. Stephenson on my behalf with Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton, who
together constitute what is known as the Crewe Circle. The two mediums
reside at Crewe, in Cheshire, England.
The amount of evidence of the genuineness of the Crewe Circle productions,
to be found in Coates' work and in British journals devoted to psychic matters
is overwhelming.
Some excellent evidence in favour of the Crewe Circle was published by
Mr. George H. Breaker, a member of the American Society for Psychical Research,
in the journal of that Society in March, 1927.
Mr. Breaker is a lawyer of long standing and President of an important
Title Guarantee Company in Houston, Texas. He visited England in 1926
with the main object of investigating the powers of the English Psychic Photo‘
graphers, viz.: the Crewe Circle and Mrs. Deane.
Mr. Breaker has allowed me to publish in this work an account of his
experiments for skotographs with Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton, and I am very
grateful to him for this permission, for I consider that Mr. Breaker exercised
such care and experimented under such good conditions (not once but many
times) that the results he obtained are exceedingly evidential.
Mr. G. H. Breaker's report.
Mr. Breaker writes :—“With the Crewe workers, I asked deﬁnitely for
skotographs on August 18th, 2lst, 24th, 26th, and 31st, and on each occasion
got them.
Certain elements of procedure were employed in every instance and may be
described once for all. Plates were always obtained by me from dealers in
photographic supplies in London or in Crewe. I always secured them in
sealed packages containing six plates, except that the packages used on
August 18th and 3lst contained each twelve plates. Always, before I reached
the presence of the medium or mediums, I marked these packages with indelible
pencil. On one side I would write my name, Geo. H. Breaker; on the other,
'
Psy.' To no person through or from whom I obtained the plates did I ever
give any information as to the use which I intended to make of them.
With the exception of the experiment of August 21st, as described in its
place, these skotographs were obtained without the use of a camera. The
procedure was always as follows: On arriving at Mr. Hope's séance room at
144, Market Street, Crewe, I put the sealed package of plates, marked as above
described, on the centre of the table. Mr. Hope, Mrs. Buxton and I placed
our hands on the top of the table, the little ﬁngers of each pair of adjacent
hands of different persons touching so as to form an unbroken circle. After a
few minutes of prayer and hymns we then held the package of plates between
our hands. Mr. Hope's left hand was immediately under the package,
Mrs. Buxton's left hand next, mine outside ; and above the package the three
right hands came in similar order. After maintaining this status for some
few moments, we would break it off. Mr. Hope and I then went into the dark
room carrying the unbroken package. We turned on the red light, and I closed
Poll 98
G. H. BREAKER. Par. (29) Figs. 179 and 179.4 Page 99
the door and held my foot against it to ensure its remaining closed tightly to
prevent leakage into the room of white light or the entrance of any person.
I then examined the package and always found my marks
'
Psy' and 0Geo.
H. Breaker
'
on it in my handwriting as I had written them. I then cut open
the package and took the plates out, one by one, laying them on the shelf about
three inches from and in front of the red light ; and I immediately marked them
with indelible pencil on the emulsion side, holding the remaining plates in my
left hand securely while I marked the plates as I took them out and put them in
the dish. I always examined the dish ﬁrst carefully to see that there was nothing
in it. I also examined the dark-room, and especially the ceiling of the dark
room, to see that there was no apparatus of any kind for reﬂecting any light
or image or picture of any kind on the plates, as I took them out or while they
were in the dishes.
After I had put as many plates in a dish as it would hold I put the package
including the remaining plates in my pocket, and held the dish in my hand
while Mr. Hope poured the developing solution into it. I then kept the dish
rocking and the solution in motion until Mr. Hope pronounced the development
complete. I then poured the developing solution off and Mr. Hope poured on
the ﬁxing solution. After the plates were sufficiently ﬁxed, I poured off the
ﬁxing solution, Opened the door, went out carrying the dish, took the plates out
of the dish, went into the adjoining room, washed the plates with clear water,
and examined them carefully to see what was on them. This, of course, was
so that I might be sure that the prints which we obtained the next day were a
correct representation of what was on the plates.
Fig. 179A Fig. 179
(29) On August 18th. under this procedure, we obtained the skotograph
reproduced herewith (Fig. 179). This plate carries, in a cloudy background, the
words: 'Consolation from sweet memories.' This was the only one of the
plates used on this date that carried extra markings, which makes inapplicable
any theory of fraud as applied to the entire package of plates, as a unit, and
which accordingly localizes. right in the dark-room, any fraud which may be
alleged. Here alone fraud could work on individual plates. This is of
importance, here and on later dates, since it puts the advocate of fraud under
the necessity of picturing a sleight-of-hand process worked under my very eyes,
and in such extremely clever fashion as to lead me still to report that Mr. Hope
never touched the plates until after they had been developed and inspected by
me. It is evident that in all experiments in psychic photography all plates of
the package should be developed. for the sake of the highly important additional
safeguard thus obtained. Fig. I79A is an enlargement reversed of the mirror
writing in Fig. 179.
Page 100 Figs. 1798 andC Pars. (290) (29b) G. H. BREAKER.
Following this ﬁrst
result, on August 2lst
we got the photograph
(the camera was used in
this experiment, which
is cited here because of
the connection which
will immediately ap
pear) here illustrated
(Fig. 179B). On this
are found, on a cloudy
background, the words
'
Dear darling, my
thoughts are often with
you because much of
our consolation is from
sweet memories.' I sat
before the camera here ; but I am completely hidden in the picture. Certainly
this result, too, is difﬁcult of explanation in terms of fraud.
Fig. 179B
(29¢) These two results (Figs. 179 and 179B) are highly evidential as regards
the use of the expression "sweet memories." These words formed part of a
prayer which I had made in thanksgiving at a Christmas dinner of 1925 at
the home of one of my sons, and again in June, 1926, at a birthday dinner in
the home of another son. Of course, I had my wife in mind when using these
words and equally so when sitting for psychic results of any sort.
This correspondence is, to me, most signiﬁcant. I had hoped that there
might even turn out to be some parallelism between the penmanship on these
plates and that of my deceased wife ; but I am apparently unable to get any
adequate assurance that this is the case.
[For a similar emergence of an appropriate phrase stored away in the memory of the
experimenter, see footnote p. 151.]
_ (291;) August 24th brought forth the
result illustrated (Fig. 179C) showing lilies
of the valley in skotographic form. The
usual conditions were here maintained.
except that the following also took place
0
While Mr. Hope and I were in the dark
room illuminated by the red light, I took
three of the plates out of the package
and marked them, holding the rest of the
package in my left hand. Then I put one
of the marked plates carrying my own
name, in a black envelope; another
carrying the marking
0
Mrs. B.' in
another black envelope ; and a third, on
which I had written Mr. Hope's name
as identiﬁcation mark, I wrapped up in
brown paper. W0 then returned to the
_ séance room, I carrying the plates in their
Flg- 179C wrappings in my hand, and the package
of remaining plates in my pocket ; and we held the plates in their wrappings
between our hands, as it was usual for us to hold the unbroken packages.
G. H. BREAKER. Par. (29c) Figs. 179D, E, fungi PaggeﬁiOl
Mrs. Buxton then suggested that we determine one thing that we wanted to
appear on these plates, and asked me what particularly I would like to get.
I told her the name
0
Lillie
'
(my deceased wife's name). She replied that we
might suggest to the unseen friends that, if they could not write the name as
asked for, they might draw lilies or other ﬂowers. We agreed on all this, and
made the request very earnestly. We then (Mr. Hope and I) returned again to
the dark-room, and I myself developed the plates without assistance from
Mr. Hope. Proponents of the spirit hypothesis will doubtless ﬁnd it signiﬁcant
to learn that my wife was an oil painter of sufﬁcient distinction to win several
prizes ; and that I have in my possession oil paintings by her of ﬂowers. Those
who hold against the spirit hypothesis but ﬁnd it possible still to accept results
of this character as genuine will perhaps be impressed with this conspicuous
success following an experiment in which the sitter was honestly and sincerely
sympathetic and co-operative with the mediums, without being at the same
time at all blind to the procedures necessary to establish validity of the
phenomena.
Fig. 179D Fig. 179E Fig. 179F
(29¢) August 3lst brought us the three plates (Figs. 179D, E, and F).
Fig. No. 179D shows the letters
0
L.G.’ very indistinctly. They appeared on the
ﬁrst plate in the package; Fig. 179E shows these letters more plainly; they
appeared on the third plate; the one showing them very distinctly (Fig. 179E)
appeared on the fourth plate. I got these skotographs at 6 p.m. in the afternoon
of Tuesday, August 3lst. Sunday night and Monday morning, and Monday
night and Tuesday morning, I had, audibly, in my room, called my deceased
wife's attention to the fact that we would sit on Tuesday afternoon for the last
skotograph, and I had asked her for the letters
'
L.G.’—the
'
L' being
the ﬁrst letter of her name, and the
'
G
'
the ﬁrst letter of mine.
I had to wait at the drug store for the plates to arrive from Liverpool. I saw
the truck bearing the name of Liverpool drive up to the store and a box
taken out and brought into the store and opened, and saw the clerk take out of
the box a package of plates and hand it to me. That was the package of plates
which we used on August 3lst in getting the letters
'
L.G.’
At the sitting on Tuesday afternoon, August 3lst, while Mr. Hope and
Mrs. Buxton and I were holding the unbroken package of six plates between our
hands and going through the usual formula of prayer and hymns, Mr. Hope
asked what I wanted to get on the skotographs on these plates. I replied
that I wanted the letters
'
L.G.' Mr. Hope and I then immediately went into
the dark-room, I carrying the unbroken package, and we turned
on the red
Page 102 Par. (29d) G. H. BREAKER.
light. I then took out two plates and laid them on their clear sides on the
shelf on which the red light rested, about three inches in front of the red light,
and marked them as shown in the reproductions, holding the package con
taining the remaining four plates in my left hand between my thumb and
ﬁngers. I then put the two marked plates in a dish, observing carefully that
there was nothing in the dish, and that the chemical sides of the plates were
above and not under the plates. I then put in my pocket the package of the
four remaining plates and held the dish while Mr. Hope poured the developing
solution into it. I then proceeded to develop the two plates and saw the skoto
graph forming on the ﬁrst of them (F
ig.
179D). After that plate was developed
I
held
it
up to the light and saw that the marks were just as shown in the repro
duction herewith.
Mr. Hope and
I
then went back to the dark-room and in the same way
I
took
the other plates out of the package, one by one, and marked them, one by one,
holding the package of remaining plates in my left hand, while
I
put marks on
the plates. When
I
had marked all the four plates
I
put them in three dishes,
two in one dish and one each in a smaller dish, observing carefully that nothing
was in either of the dishes, and keeping the chemical side up with all the plates.
As
I
developed the plates after Mr. Hope had poured the solution on,
I
saw,
forming on the third plate, the skotograph shown in Fig. 179E; and
I
saw, forming
on the fourth plate very distinctly, the skotograph of Fig. 1791:.
I
then went out
and held the two plates (third and fourth) up to the light and saw clearly these
same skotographs that appear in the Figures.
It will be observed that the unseen entities progressed in writing the letters
'L.G.’ Each succeeding result was an improvement on the preceding, and
the last, the fourth plate, was much the best and clearest.
(29d) Mr. Hope did not touch any of the plates from ﬁrst to last, nor did
Mrs. Buxton. Only
I
touched them. There was certainly nothing in the dishes.
Mrf0Hope had no possible time or chance, after
I
said that
I
wanted 'L.G.'
to write these letters and plant them in any way in the dishes. He did not
get out of my sight until after the plates had been developed.
I
had some correspondence with Sir Oliver Lodge concerning these skoto
graphs, revolving mainly around the philosophy of the situation in which
I
had told the mediums what
I
hoped to get on my plates. Sir Oliver wrote me
:
“
. though
it
seems
a
pity you had to tell Mr. Hope of what you had
privately requested your wife to produce on the plate
if
she could. No doubt
the letters are there
;
but
it
would have seemed more striking
if
you could
have testiﬁed to Mr. Hope's ignorance of what
it
was that you expected or
hoped for.
It
is
difﬁcult to see why his knowledge was important or effective
[this, of course,
is
more notably the case under the spirit hypothesis, which
Sir Oliver supports, as do
I
myself, than
it
is
under any of the alternatives
to which the French school of psychical research inclines, though
it
may be
that the result would not have been obtained without that knowledge.
It
will be noted that under the anti-spiritistic theory, one must speciﬁcally
deny Mr. Hope's possession of
a
metagnomic faculty sufﬁcient to determine,
without being told, what
it
was that
I
sought].
" The laws of the phenomena seem to be very puzzling and unknown
;
and
I
congratulate you on being able to obtain at any rate some positive
results under conditions which, to a large extent, are laid down by yourself."
I
went to Crewe carrying with me two packages of plates from London.
Before going to Mr. Hope
I
went to the drug store in Crewe from which
I
got the
plates in August, and had the clerk who had always waited on me set aside for
me two packages of plates.
I
then went to Mr. Hope and told him that
I
was
asking my wife for some special thing, but gave him no further information.
G. H. BREAKER. Pars. (29e) (29f) Page 103
On October 13th we got a skotograph of lilies of the valley, which some
have thought.were intended to show the letter 'Lf when held one way and
'
T '
when held another way.
On October 14th we got skotographs on two plates, of hazy patches, in one
of which, however, a face is distinctly visible.
I had now used up all the plates which I had brought from London and
still had not got
o
L.T.B.' which I was silently wishing for. I then went to
the drug store and called for the young lady clerk who had waited on me and
had her bring to me the two packages of plates which she had set aside for
me. I told her I was not yet ready for those two packages but had her give
me another package. I then went to Mr. Hope and had a sitting at 1l-30 am.
on October 15th ; on two plates skotographs appeared containing cloudy
marks and one face.
(29¢) I still had not got the letters 'L.T.B.' and was to have but one more
sitting—at 3.30 pm. the same day, October 15th. I then went to the drug store
and called for the young lady and had her bring me the two packages of plates
which she had set aside for me and had her say that they were certainly the
same packages which she had set aside for me. I then told her that I did not
want either of those packages of plates, and had her give me another package.
I then went to Mr. Hope and told him that it was evident that I could not
get what I was asking my wife for without the concentration of our three minds—
his, Mrs. Buxton's and mine—and in order to get that concentration I would now
tell him what I was asking for, viz. : the letters
'
L.T.B.’ He suggested that
I state on which plate of the six in the package I wished these letters to appear ;
I chose the ﬁrst plate in response to this, and so stated. He suggested then
that I number the plates as I picked them out of the package and add the
number to my other markings. This I did. We then proceeded in the usual
fashion with the sitting and development. We got two skotographs; one
showing the number 3 plate marking, carries in addition to this only a circular
patch; the other shows my number 1 plate mark, and in addition the letters
'L.T.B.’ written twice, one of the writings being mirror writing, each on a
circular cloudy white patch, half an inch in diameter. The 'T' and 0B
'
are both very much like my wife's handwriting.
I cannot insist too vigorously upon the certainly genuine character of the
present results, I insist that adverse criticism be based upon a deﬁnite showing
of how my results and my conditions of sitting may be ﬁtted into a picture
of fraud. And until it is made, I shall insist upon due respect for the presumptive
validity of the phenomena herein described."
(29f) Professor T. FUKURAI of Japan, is another careful investigator of
Mr. Hope with ten years' experience of similar research in his own country (see
his book Clairvoyance and Thoughtography,* pp. 236-244). *Rider 8: Co., London.
Professor Fukurai (in 1928), accompanied by a Japanese friend, took all
the precautions which his great experience dictated. He obtained Extra faces,
a sentence in French and, what he particularly desired, skotographs on two
plates in one packet of plates, which skotographs make one complete picture
when the plates are placed edge to edge (a more deﬁnite picture would have
been welcome ; but the two portions do ﬁt together). An illustration of these
marks is contained in the professor's work. A remarkable experiment well
worth repeating.
In his valuable work Prof. Fukurai reports his obtaining over thirty skoto
graphs in his own country with Japanese mediums, employing several for the
purpose.
CHAPTER VII.
H (9 F or Hands and Feel Experiments.
The illustrations or results are natural size unless otherwise stated.
In this chapter I deal with marks which appeared on materials other than
photographic plates, when placed in the neighbourhood of Mrs. Deane's hands
and body.
At ﬁrst the idea in my mind was to detect something in the nature of
radiation emanating from Mrs. Deane's hands, although the freak markings on
the photographic plates do not suggest radiation.
The results of the H & F experiments do0 not suggest radiation either.
The photo-plate freaks appear to me to be due to the action of some chemical,
and the H & F results are certainly due to the action of some applied substance.
Many readers will conclude that Mrs. Deane applied the various materials
in a perfectly natural manner, undetected by me. I can assure such readers
they are in error, and if they will have the patience to peruse the whole H & F
chapter, they will ﬁnd much therein to cause them to alter their opinion.
The substances used were plain paper, ferroprussiate paper (architect's blue
printing paper), pigmented tissue (bichromated gelatine), frosted glass (focussing
screens), and a few other materials.*
The effects of Mrs. Deane's hands
(?)
upon photographic plates, as recorded
in previous pages of this book, naturally led me to make experiments on light
sensitive piussiate paper; the results therewith carried me on to the other
materials.
As will be seen in my reports, brown marks appeared upon the ferroprussiate
paper, and indeed upon all the materials used by me.
I
conclude from this
that the nature of the material used by me in my experiments did not inﬂuence
the results. When
I
used Autotype pigmented tissue, where the gelatine was
rendered insoluble,
it
was also coloured brown. Sir. A. Conan Doyle found
a
large brown mark (distinctly brown) on one of his Deane plates at the Stead
Bureau.
I
read in
a
copy of Light that direct writing obtained recently in
Italy was of a brown colour.
(30) The substance most likely to produce on plain paper marks of colours
similar to those obtained in my experiments, varying from very light yellowish
brown to dark brown with pink shades, many becoming very dark through
oxidation (probably),
is
a
solution of Amidol in water. Oxidation of
a
practically
invisible stain made with
a
freshly-made Amidol solution in water would account
for the latent effects. Against the supposition that Amidol was always used
(if
ever)
is
the fact that the many marks found on ferroprussiate paper were light
brown turning dark, whereas
a
solution of Amidol produces nearly black marks
on ferroprussiate paper, quite different from those appearing at the sittings.
It
is
questionable therefore whether the brown marks were produced with Amidol.
I
may say that
I
regard these H
&
F
experiments as the most important
part of my work, as they leave my own reliability for the sole front of attack
against the proofs of telepathy, telekinesis and apports which
I
adduce.
oThe results obtained are practically what
is
known as "Direct writing" of which
innumerable instances are recorded in psychic literature. Iwill mention just three excellent
witnesses of widely different dates who recorded their own experiments, viz. Alfred Russel
Wallace in his Miracles and Modem Spiritualism, 1875, p. 131; Hamlin Garland in his Forty
Years
of
Psychic Research, 1936, pp. 253 to 254 and 382; and Guldenstubbé in the Appendix
to this book, pp. 363 to 370, and at foot of
p.

I cannot prevent people questioning
it,
but in the coming years, when similar
phenomena have been observed quantum sah's, my reports will be recognised
as veridical. My experiments can easily be repeated with other mediums.
In all humility
l
adapt to my own case the words of Professor Richet:
"
I
put up
a
desperate defence before being convinced of the reality of objective
metapsychic phenomena. How can we ask of every man this long and prolonged
patience? This
is
why
I
have no sympathy for commissions of inquiry.
Besides, science advances always by the work of the isolated individual."
As
I
say, these phenomena are not unprecedented; somewhat similar and
much more startling results are to be found recorded throughout psychic
literature. Professor Richet himself gives an account of Eusapia Paladino
writing in chalk on plain paper while her hand contained no chalk (page 7).
As far as
I
know, however, no such systematic investigation of phenomena of this
kind has been undertaken under conditions so favourable to eliciting the truth.
In order not to weary the reader by constant repetition in the reports of my
many sittings with Mrs. Deane,
I
will give here, once for all, an account of the
methods pursued by me, and the conditions of these particular experiments,
which holds good throughout
;
any modiﬁcations will be stated.
(30a) The experiments took place in the small dark-room shown on the ground
plan (page 106) of the main room.
I
had had
it
constructed at my factory and
ﬁxed in the séance room by one of my workmen, with my assistance.
The internal measurements of the dark-room are 3-ft. deep, 4-ft. 4-in. wide,
6-ft. 6-in. high. The position of the ruby glass window was as shown in the
plan on the side of the closet which was vis‘1i-vis Mrs. Deane. This ruby
window faced obliquely the large window of the main room.
-
The light from the ruby window and the conditions of the experiments were
such that
I
was certain
I
should have seen any trickery.
It
is
not aquestion of
one or two experiments, but of six hundred; on several occasions Mrs. D. obtained
on paper and on glass, letters and words which
I
thought of but never uttered,
trickery
is
effectively ruled out by this alone. See also Madame Noels’
experiments (268) page 281.
To overcome the bad light of dark, foggy days
I
made use at the sitting of
March 17th, 1925, and at all subsequent sittings, of
a
red electric torch.
I
did
not conﬁne the use of
it
to dark days, but had
it
hanging round my neck, or
in my hand at all times. .
Mrs. Deane sat on
a
four-legged wooden stool, l8-in. high, Lil-in. from back
to front, and ll-in. wide. She generally leant heat back against the side of the
dark-room opposite the ruby window. -
There were three plain deal shelves, {-in. thick, ﬁxed against the wall on
Mrs. Deane's left as she sat. The bottom shelf was I7l-in. from the ground;
it
was 9-in. wide
;
the next was l7-in. above the lowest, and 12l-in. wide
;
the
top one was l73-in. above the second and 9-in. wide. The door was bolted to
exclude all daylight, except that which came through the red window.
During each experiment
I
stood quite close facing Mrs. Deane, and was free
to bend down, or to crouch down to make any observations
I
desired.
I
arrived, as
a
rule, at 10-30 arm, and we started at 10-45 and concluded
about 12-30 (two hours).
Mrs. Deane was generally employed in the yard with her dogs, or in the
kitchen when
I
knocked, and
I
frequently preceded her to the studio
;
in any
case,
it
was my constant practice to examine the interior of the dark-room,
ﬂoor, shelves, etc., for anything of a suspicious nature.
On every occasion
I
brought all the material and apparatus to be used for
experiments with me, and took them all away with me, with the exception of
the large footboard on which
I
was in the habit of afﬁxing pieces of clean paper

I
examined this board always with care. In
addition
I
brought on each occasion
a
clean duster with which to wipe
Mrs. Deane's hands.
I
always looked over her hands and nails carefully and
wiped them several times during the course of the day's experiments. As my
aim was absolute proof,
it
is
natural
I
took every care
I
could devise.
The medium generally sang something now and again,
I
at times joined in.

She gave me two hours of her time to carry out what experiments I
desired. I had absolute control of all the conditions. The initiation of the
experiments rested with me absolutely. The nature of the things to be done
at any one sitting was quite unknown to Mrs. Deane until I put the materials
into position.
The ﬁrst few experiments are uninteresting and unimportant. They are
recorded to give the reader a view of my methods, and how I was led from one
thing to another, and how the results increased in importance, and to enable
him to realise that by the multitude of experiments under similar conditions
I was training myself, and ever increasingr my powers of observation for the
particular phenomena.
In the face of the great number of these experiments, I must, indeed, have
been very blind and dull-witted to have been deceived all the time; besides,
there are many results which could not have been produced by any trickery.
A few of these Hand and Foot experiments were of a standard character,
and were made by me in a similar way on many occasions. In order not to
weary the reader by repetitions, I give here short particulars of these standard
experiments. Where there were variations in the experiments I shall give
them. Each experiment lasted, as a rule, ﬁfteen minutes.
(30b) Standard Cartridge Paper Experiments.—This consisted in Mrs. Deane
holding, pressed between her open hands, paper variously treated. measuring
16-in. x 5-in. folded in half to 8-in. X 5-in.; as a rule two sheets, making
eight pages.
(31) Standard Wax-Paper Experiments—I cut a large sheet of clean wax
paper, which I took from the stock of paper at my warehouse, into sixteen
pieces, each measuring H-in. X 5-in. I pinned them together by means of a large
pin at one corner and Mrs. Deane held the packet of sixteen sheets pressed between
her open hands for ﬁfteen minutes.
(32) Standard Starched Glass Experiments.—Mrs. Deane held between her
open hands a piece of glass, halt-plate size, on one surface of which was spread
a paste of starch either plain or containing iodide of potassium. The clear side
of the glass lay on Mrs. Deane's left hand while she held her right hand open an
inch or so above it.
(33) Standard Focussing Screens (ground glass) Experiments.—Mrs. Deane
held, pressed between her open hands, a pair of half-plate size focussing screens,
ground surfaces outside, free from any material, just the glass.
(34) Standard Hand-Stocks No. I (with
arches in easel) Experiments.—In these
experiments Mrs. Deane's hands were
imprisoned by means of the arches in the
easel of a structure which I call
" hand
stocks," see illustration (Fig. 180A). While

had already introduced the use

ruby light from the window.
Page 108 Fig. 181 Par. (35) HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS.
(35) Standard Tape Hand-Stocks Experiments.—In these experimentsImade
use of a hand-stocks rather different from that just described. The characteristic
features of it are seen in the illustration (Fig. 181). Mrs. Deane's wrists were
,
Openingb inch - l0 mm.—,~
imprisoned by means of a strong tape l-in. wide pinned down as shown. The
wrists rested on what may be called a bridge, beneath which was a channel
with upright sides forming angles of 90 degrees with the bottom of the _channel ;
the depth of the channel is ig-in. ; the open space below the bridge or roof of
the channel is {ti-in. ; just sufficient to allow of the insertion of a piece of pencil
or coloured chalk. The channel is divided into two sections, one under the right,
HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS. Par. (36) Fig. 182 Page 109
the other under the left wrist. Into each of these two channels I inserted a
piece of lead pencil or a coloured chalk, chosen by me from a box of twelve
colours, after Mrs. Deane's hands had been taped down by me. After taping
down Mrs. Deane's wrists, I wiped her hands with my own duster, and rubbed
them on a piece of clean paper. Then I placed under each of Mrs. Deane's
open hands the paper or glass to be experimented with. I also put on the
easel a piece of paper, or a photographic plate, as I pleased. Often marks
have appeared upon the papers under her hands and on the paper on
the easel, in chalk of a colour of one or other of the chalks chosen by me and
inserted by me in the channels. It is most difficult in the daylight with a thin
little ﬁnger, with the hands free, to abstract 21 chalk from the channel, and
when the board with the papers pinned on it is under Mrs. Deane's hands, it is
out of the question that she could obtain possession of one of the two chalks
(colours chosen by me out of a dozen) without my observing her movements.
The light from the ruby window was supplemented by a red electric torch
I held in my hand and made use of frequently; always at the least sound.
The facts recorded in my following reports are so exceptional, that I must
point out again the impossibility of fraud under the conditions. There is no
escape from admitting that the results were supernormally produced.
(36) Standard Double-Frame Experiments.—The piece of apparatus usedin
these experiments consisted of two wooden frames fastened together by means
of pieces of cork glued on at the
corners. The dimensions and
general arrangements are seen in
the illustration (Fig. 182). The
frames are %-in. apart to allow of
the insertion of a piece of pencil
or chalk. The internal edge of the
frame is vertical, forming an angle
of 90 degrees with the cardboard
pinned on each, so that the pencil
cannot roll out unless the frames
are held vertical. Into each
frame a piece of cardboard is
inserted from without and held
down by drawing pins. The
double-frame was placed between
Mrs. Deane's hands after her hands
\

A,
were examined and wiped on my
own clean duster brought with 1::—
me. Her two hands were then
taped down securely by means of 5%o! "h"
tapes as shown. She was seated Fig- 181
on her stool, with my large black
cloth over her lap reaching down to the ﬂoor, and held the frames as described
for ﬁfteen minutes. After her wrists were taped down I inserted a piece of
coloured chalk ( chosen by me out of twelve colours) or a piece of pencil, between
the frames. I stood opposite her watching and had the red light from the ruby
window and a red torch in my hand, which I used frequently. I am very keen
of hearing. It must be agreed that under these conditions it was impossible
for Mrs. Deane to write in large letters on the outside of the cards without my
detecting her, and still more impossible for her to put any design on an inner
surface of the two pieces of cardboard, and yet a design appeared there
(see page 218).

intothe room, and when in position
was just in front of Mrs. Deane's
knees, l-in. above the top of the
knees. The main feature of this
apparatus is a piece of wood,
12-in. X 10-in., ﬁn. thick,
hanging by two hinges from a
ﬁxed cross-bar. This I call the
shutter. There is an upright
board at either side, extending
6-in. backwards. The shutter
hangs vertically and faces
Mrs. Deane. At the back of it,
but loose from it, is a swinging
bar of wood at the lower end of
which is a cross-bar. The whole
of this is referred to in the
diagram as the
“
T-piece." One
end of this
"
T-piece
"
just
touches the back of the wooden
plate or shutter; the other end
of this cross-piece is grooved. Into
this groove ﬁts a piece of india
rubber tubing stretched from side
to side and attached to the two
side pieces or "jambs." The
result of this device is that when the wooden shutter is pressed away from
Mrs. Deane it very quickly meets with the resistance of the rubber tubing, and
the more it is pressed in the greater the resistance. In the wooden shutter, at
one side, a hole has been made, parallel with its surface. This hole takes a
pencil with a coiled spring behind it, the tension of which is just sufﬁcient to
press the pencil against the right-hand
“
jamb," on to which a piece of clean
paper is ﬁxed for each experiment. By this means I obtained a pencil marking
showing me the greatest distance the shutter
(38)
had been pushed in.
the shutter I ﬁxed, by means of drawing pins,
a piece of sooted cardboard, so that anything
touching the surface to push it, would leave
a mark. When this apparatus is used Mrs.
Deane's hands are imprisoned in the stocks.
Head-paper
sisted in my tying round Mrs. Deane's head a
piece of cartridge paper 20-in. long and 7-in.
wide, folded over l-in. along its length to allow
of the insertion of a piece of string for tying
on (Fig. 184).
(39) Breast-paper Experiments.—For this ex
periment Mrs. Deane inserted under her blouse,
against the skin of her breast, a piece of paper
about 9-in. long and 6-in. high.
had some trouble in placing this ﬂat, and in
removing it at the end of the sitting. Both
operations were always executed in my presence.
On the front surface of

Mrs. Deane
HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (40) (41) Fig. 185 Page 111
It was certainly impossible to remove the paper during the sitting without my
knowledge, or to write upon it in situ.
(40) Hand-stocks Photographic Plate Experiments—While Mrs. Deane's hands
were imprisoned in the tape-stocks, I often placed under each of her hands a
half-plate photographic plate. I also often placed one or a pair of sensitive
quarter-plates on the easel. The result of these photographic plates experiments
are recorded in chapter IV.
(41) Foot‘paper Experiments.—I placed a piece of paper, plain, or treated in
some way, measuring 18-in. long and 10-in. wide, under Mrs. Deane's feet, which
were nude, stockinged or booted, as will be speciﬁed in each day's report.
I will now proceed with the detailed reports of some of the sittingsI held
with Mrs. Deane for these H 81 F effects, giving the reports chronologically.
A great many experiments yielding only brown spots are omitted.
All illustrations of results are of natural (original) size, unless otherwise stated.
July 14th, 1924,—To-day I commenced using other material than photo
graphic plates. My ﬁrst experiments in this direction, conducted in the
photographic cabinet described in the introduction to this chapter, were made
with ferroprussiate paper, as this is sensitive to light. I placed a piece of
moistened ferroprussiate paper"I on a piece of glass, quarter-plate size, and
placed that on a kind of miniature iron shovel. Mrs. Deane held the handle of
this in her left hand, and the handle of a similar iron instrument with teeth
cut in it over the paper. (Fig. 185). After waiting a minute or two, I opened the
Fig. 185
door and examined the paper in daylight. There were brown stains upon it,
but not in a position corresponding with the points of the prongs. We
repeated the experiment with another piece of ferroprussiate paper. This
time we obtained a lot of little circles reminiscent of some of those which appear
at times on photographic plates acted upon by the presence of Mrs. Deane's
hands. We tried the experiment a third time, but on this occasion we obtained
nothing.
July 21“, 1924,—I had constructed a piece of apparatus in wood to hold
the two iron instruments, illustrated above (Fig. 185) so that one should
be held rigidly above the other %-in. apart. The wooden apparatus was of
such a size that a piece of glass, quarter-plate size, could be inserted on to
the lower iron. I put a piece of cardboard to close up that side of the wooden
holder which was nearest Mrs. Deane and inserted my plates from the other
side, the side away from her.
In experiments with this apparatus Mrs. Deane held the two handles of
the iron instruments. I put a piece of moistened ferroprussiate paper on a
piece of clear glass, quarter-plate size, and placed that on the iron surface.
She held the two iron handles for ﬁve minutes, while I stood over her.
On my removing the glass with the paper from the apparatus, it was seen to be
covered on the side near Mrs. Deane with a lot of red spots in shape similar
to those mentioned before. I placed the paper, still on the glass, into a basin
of water ; the spots changed to a grey colour and later became dark blue, and
the water acquired a red tinge. The spot on the paper furthest from Mrs. Deane
retained a reddish colour.
" See p. 281 (268).
Page 112 Figs. 186, 187 HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS.
I may repeat that .\lrs. Deane never knew what experiments I was going
to make, nor the material I was likely to work with.
July 24th, 1924,—The piece of wooden apparatus, mentioned before,
has top and bottom boards about fin. in thickness. On the top piece I
had a further piece of wood ﬁxed.
and through this and the piece of
wood to which it was nailed I made
. a conical hole into which I ﬁxed a
funnel-shaped piece of iron with a
}-in. hole at the point. When in
_A position it was about }-in. over the
centre of’ the iron plate below
(Fig. 186). Mrs. Deane held the
handle of the left iron in her left
hand, and the cone in her right hand.
Fig. r86 I placed a clear quarter-plate of
glass with a piece of moistened ferro
prussiate paper upon it in the apparatus. After a time a very dark mark
appeared upon it. I put the paper into the
water, the mark was dark brown with blue
shading when dry. I then dipped a third
piece of ferroprussiate paper in water, and,
while wet, placed it on a quarter-plate clear
glass and placed the glass on Mrs. Deane's left
hand, paper upwards, and Mrs. Deane placed
her right hand over it without touching it.
Soon a whitish oval appeared like a garland
(Fig. 187), changing to brown. The colour
penetrated through to the back, as was also
the case with the previous mark. Fis- r87
July 28th, 1924,—The fact of the ferroprussiate paper being bleached
brought to my mind peroxide of hydrogen, although, of course, this would not
bleach ferroprussiate. It occurred to me, therefore, to try whether Mrs. Deane's
hands would have any effect upon starch paste containing iodide of potassium,
which would be stained blue by peroxide. I made a starch paste containing
5% of iodide of potassium and spread a little of this on a piece of ﬁlter-paper
placed on a piece of glass. I placed the glass on Mrs. Deane's left hand, and
she held her right hand over the paste without touching it, the ﬁngers directed
outwards, just above the paper. This was done in the daylight; nothing
happened. I then seated Mrs. Deane on a chair in the dark-room and we
repeated the experiment. Some brownish spots appeared on the paper, quite
twenty in number, also reminiscent of those ovals before mentioned. The
spots were brownish blue. In water they became light brown and remained
after much washing. Mrs. Deane knew nothing about the iodide being in the
starch, nor what I was trying for. The brown stain was not affected by hypo.
The iodide produces in time by itself brown stains in the starch paste. These
iodide brown stains are removed by the hypo; whereas Mrs. Deane's brown
marks are not so removed.
July 31st, 1924,—I ﬁnd that soapy hands produce white marks on ferro
prussiate paper. I tried the effect of Mrs. Deane's hands on ferroprussiate
paper, damped, held between the two hands without glass, the hands pressed
direct on to the paper. Her ﬁngers produced white marks in some cases, and
HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS. Par. (42) Fig. 188 Page 113
with a further two such pieces of paper there were a lot of brown spots. One
of her ﬁnger tips produced a lot of deep blood-red spots on another piece of such
paper. These spots did not wash out. She had washed and dried her hands
before this experiment.
I tried a similar experiment with one of my lady clerks, but no such marks
were produced.
August 6th, 1924,—Experiments with starch paste, result nil. Mrs. Deane
had washed her hands with soap and water before we commenced experiments
to-day, and then rinsed her hands in cold running water in my sight, and
wiped her hands on the clean duster I had brought with me. After each
experiment this rinsing and wiping took place. We went into the dark-room.
I dipped a piece of ferroprussiate paper in plain water and placed the paper
(damped) on Mrs. Deane's left hand, white side down, and Mrs. Deane held
her right hand over it for some minutes while we chatted ; I kept my eyes on
her hands. After ﬁve minutes I concluded the experiment and we removed
the paper upon which were a quantity of deep brown marks (Fig. 188).
The result of this experi
ment was, I considered, very
encouraging. The conditions
under which it was made
were perfectly satisfactory,
and the result, in my view,
is highly interesting and
evidential.
(42) Comment: There
appears to be a duplication of
a pair of marks, a pair of
shadowgraphs, as it were.
I call the "A" mark a
"Queen Mary” and the "B"
mark a
“
Dog's Head." I can
imagine similar pictures pro
duced by shadows. If one
, _ made a cardboard

”
and held it
not quite square between a point of light and a white ground, one might obtain
such an irregular imperfect outline as Fig. Al, and if one brought the same piece
of cardboard nearer the point of light with a slightly different slope, one would
get the Fig. A2. It must be remembered the paper has been washed and the
marks blurred in the process.
As regards Fig. B2, this strikes me as dimly representing a dog's head.
In this case the cardboard ﬁgure of the dog's head was, supposedly, held more
correctly than in Fig. B1, therefore the dog's head comes out more clearly
deﬁned in B2 than in BI. Two or three of the other marks suggest imperfect
shadowgraphs of faces.
I would add that when I washed this ferroprussiate paper, which has the
deep brown marks upon it, the washing water became quite pink, as on a previous
occasion. I made further experiments to-day of a similar character without
any deﬁnite result.

being above a piece of prussiate paper
placed on the board. The result was
some scattered and agglomerated brown
spots, chieﬂy from the right foot ; the
feet are not outlined (Fig.189 X g linear).
At the same time Mrs. Deane held
a piece of ferroprussiate paper folded,
sensitive side outwards, and ﬁxed in
a cardboard frame. I had damped
the paper at the back. On one half of
the paper on her right hand there
came a lot of ﬁne spots of a deep brown
colour, chieﬂy from the wrist end of
the hand (Fig. 190). On the paper on
August 18th, 1924.—1 covered a
plate of clear glass, half-plate size,
with starch paste with 5% iodide of
potassium. Mrs. Deane held the plate
in her left hand, the starched surface
upwards, and her right hand over it for
some ten minutes. On examination
nothing characteristic, only the slightest
brown speck. On Wednesday I found
it had developed brown marks. These
brown spots were not affected by hypo.
I placed under Mrs. Deane's feet
a board with a 2-in. ledge. Mrs. Deane
took off her boots and stockings and
rested her heels upon the 2-in. wide,
i-in. thick ledge, the soles of her feet
her left hand near the ﬁnger tips were
many much ﬁner specks. Mrs. Deane
had washed her hands before the ex
periment and wiped them on my duster.
I then took a large iron dish. I
washed this dish at the tap and soaked
some brown paper in it, pouring off
the superﬂuous water. I placed on
this brown paper a piece of ferro
prussiate paper; Mrs. Deane's feet were
upon it for about half-an-hour.
Result : the paper under feet was
covered, where the feet had rested, with
brown spots and patches. The portion
of the paper above the toes had a
few brown spots. (Fig. 191X l linear).
H & F EXPERIMENTS. Pan. (420) (42b) Figs. 192 to 194 Page 115
August 21 st, 1924.—Mrs. Deane washed her feet in plain warm water in the
studio in my presence. and wiped them on a clean towel I brought with me.
I washed Mrs. Deane's iron tray, which is about 14-in. long by 12-in. wide, at
the tap. I then poured some hot water into it to warm it, and covered the
bottom completely with a piece of doubly folded Kraft brown paper, and
poured warm water on it to thoroughly damp it. I poured off the superﬂuous
water. I placed on the brown paper a piece of ferroprussiate paper, rather
blue through exposure to light, about l3-in. X ll-in., sensitive side up. On
this I placed a. larger piece of ferroprussiate paper of a light green colour
sensitive side upwards. This was about 4-in. longer than the tray. I pressed
the papers down so that the topmost sheet was slightly damp. Mrs. Deane sat
on a stool in the dark-room, taking care all the time that her feet did not touch
the ﬂoor, but were resting on my towel. I then put the tray under her feet,
removing the towel, and she placed her feet in the tray, so that her feet did
not touch one another. The heels were close against one narrow end of the
tray. The end of the paper further away from Mrs. Deane was about 3-in.
longer than her feet. I bent it backwards over her toes. I covered her feet
and shins with my black cloth.
The paper under the feet showed no markings at all from the sole of the
left foot. I had outlined the feet with a pencil before covering them. Above
the left toes were one or two brown
spots. As to the right foot, there was
a big brown mark about 3-in. wide by
3-in. long at the further part of the
instep behind the toes. This mark was
a deep brown, very dense in the centre
part, and shading off towards the edges
in ﬁne spots (Fig. 192 X} linear). The
ferroprussiate paper, which I had put
below the upper one, had a smaller
brown mark (F
ig.
193). On the brown
paper below that
is
also
a
brown mark
(Fig. 194). The material used had
evidently soaked through the two
upper papers. The part folded over
the backs of the right toes also had
a
few brown spots.
The portion of the folded brown
paper of the ﬁrst experiment, which
was touching the tray, was not marked
at all as regards that side of
it
which
was against the iron tray. The stains
on the two pieces of ferroprussiate
paper penetrated to the under side
of the paper.
(424) Comment. As
I
know Mrs.
Fig. 193 Fig 194
Deane had no opportunity to put these
brown stains on the paper,
I
can only conclude that the brown material was
apported. This conclusion
is
borne out by many other experiments reported
by me in this book.

and ferricyanide of potash, drying them in the air afterwards in the dark.
and thus impregnated the cellophane with ferroprussiate of potash.
I took a large enamelled iron tray, and washed it at the tap. I placed a
piece of Kraft brown paper, folded once, to cover the whole bottom of the
tray. On this I placed a piece of prussiate paper, sensitive side up, about
ll-in. X 10-in. On that a similar piece in a similar way. On that I placed
the three pieces of cellophane, one on top of the other (cellophane is artiﬁcial
silk in sheet form, practically cellulin). The sheets were somewhat humid.
Mrs. Deane was sitting in the dark-room with her feet on my overcoat.
I took my coat away and slid the dish under her feet, and placed them on the
cellophane, so that they were completely on the cellophane, and did not touch
the rim of the tray, or one another. I covered the feet with a dark cloth.
Between her hands she held a piece of ferroprussiate paper, folded over
a piece of cardboard. The paper was of such a size as to cover the inside
of her two hands completely. The paper was quite dry. She sat thus for half
an hour in the red-lighted dark-room. I stood beside her and chatted with her.
The result was: as regards the hands, a brown mark on the upper piece
under her right hand, just below the middle ﬁnger. Her hand was slightly
cupped. No brown mark on the lower left hand piece. The mark was a deep
brown with a pink shade: it showed skin ridges. The pink shade seemed to
come out more in washing the paper.
The feet had produced deep brown marks on the top sheet of cellophane,
the brown having a pinkish tinge in parts, with some blue at the edges, as also
had the hand marks. The marks were made up of a number of spots, coalescing
into a mass in the centre. The second sheet had similar marks corresponding
to the marks on the upper sheet, but smaller. The third sheet had the same,
but much less. The illustration shows the marked portions of the three sheets
under one foot (Fig. 195, page 117). These large impressions were situated
just below the toes. There were one or two brown isolated spots elsewhere.
I washed these sheets at my warehouse and the brown spots remained.
(42b) Comment—Impossible to explain how this large quantity of liquid,
penetrating the two upper sheets, reached its position.
(43) August 28th, 1924,-—I gave Mrs. D. a piece of note-paper, 8-in. X 5-in.,
laid on a piece of cardboard, to hold in her left hand. On the upper surface of
the paper was a layer of 10% KI starch paste (moist). She held her right hand
i-in. over it without touching it. In the position of the palm of her hand appeared
a large
“
S
"
2-in long and %-in. thick, pale yellow in colour. There was also a
pink streak at the side of it about i-in. X }-in. with a small yellow oval at one
end of it. I took the paper along with me still moist, and next morning I
found the
“
S
”
enlarged to double its thickness, still yellow, and the yellow
penetrated to the back of the paper. Next morning also there were many brown
ovals and other brown marks—another case of latent effect (oxidation ?)
(Fig. 196, page 118).
It is apparent that the large S "-shaped mark is not a mark made with
a ﬁnger ;* the amount of material required also negatives that theory. It will
be observed, too, that the left half of the mark and the right half of the mark
have a vague identity—reversed.
‘
I need not repeat every time that what I call the dark-room is lit by a
ruby window, as for developing photographs, and that I always stand close to
Mrs. Deane during an experiment. Impossible for Mrs. Deane to have put
to-day's large marks (illustrated) on the paper without my observing her action.
o
oThe application of a ﬁnger or any instrument would have shown itself on the moist surface
of the paste.

September lat, 1924.—Mrs. Deane sat in the dark-room during each
experiment for ten to ﬁfteen minutes.
I
placed a piece of brown paper on the ﬂoor and two pieces of dry ferro
prussiate paper on
it
under Mrs. Dcane's naked feet, the sensitive side of both
papers upwards.
I
outlined the feet with
a
pencil. Two large brown marks
appeared in the position of the instep. The upper paper of the two alone was
marked. The paper was used dry (Fig. 197 X
1
linear).
Fig. 197 Fig. 198
I
tried the same experiment with the feet with two pieces of ferroprussiate
paper very slightly damped. The upper one in this case became marked with
brown marks, but less extensively than in the ﬁrst experiment and not in the
same places as before (Fig. 198 X

September 8th, 1924,—I brought some ferroprussiate paper with me and
cut
a
strip about 10-in. wide and 16-in. long.
I
damped
it
on the back and
folded
it
so that about 6-in. of
it
should lie back over the tops of Mrs. Deane's
toes.
I
placed under the horizontal portion 10-in. X 10-in., another damped

I
placed her bare feet on the prussiate
paper. Mrs. Deane sat thus for forty minutes.
(434)
I
then prepared a piece of octavosize
writing paper by brushing over
it
a
saturated
solution of lead acetate. When dry
I
placed
it
in Mrs. Deane's left hand and asked her to
hold her right hand over it, all under my
observation by the ruby light of the window.
When
I
withdrew
it
after some ten minutes
I
took
it
out of the dark-room and examined
it
in the light and found in the central part
a
portion of the paper about l}-in. X g-m, limp,
as though the back had touched water.
Mrs. Deane's hands were perfectly dry, and
I
could not account for the appearance of the
moisture.
I
have had during these experi-
ments so many brown marks come on my
papers under exacting conditions, that
I
have
no doubt this one
is
an apport. This portion
of the paper turned colour, and on examining
the back,
I
found
a
darker picture altogether,
one portion of

Mrs. Deane placed her feet on these as before and remained thus for twenty
minutes. The result with these papers (I outlined the feet with pencil as before,
and at my request she did not move her feet during the experiment) was that
the top paper had brownish-black markings extending the whole length of each
foot, made up of traverse curved parallel lines, each line containing many small
dots (Fig. 202 X A‘ linear). The lower paper had a few larger dots which
penetrated the paper to the back, where the dots were larger.

he said
“
sweat marks." This seems unreasonable in view of
the results of my other foot experiments
;
besides, no one can make such sweat
marks by the feet.
I
think the footmarks are made by the operator with
apported material.
During the holding of the second lead paper between her hands Mrs. Deane
stated her hands felt quite hot.
During this sitting Mrs. Deane remarked she felt
a
touch on the shoulder,
and
I
saw her turn her head when she made the statement.
September 11th, I_924,—Mrs. Deane took off her boots and stockings and
sat on
a
stool in the dark-room.
I
put under her feet eight folds of brown
paper, and on that three pieces of prussiate paper about l0-in. X 10-in., all
face upwards, and on the top of these
I
put three pieces of thin white paper,
on one surface of which
I
had rubbed by means of cotton wool
a
saturated
solution of acetate of lead. These pieces were 10-in. X 15-in., all face upwards
and folded across, so that 5-in. were folded back over Mrs. Deane's toes, while
she placed her two feet on the other portion.
I
outlined her feet with
a
pencil.
She sat for over half an hour with her feet motionless on the paper.
(45) While Mrs. Deane was still sitting with her feet on the lead paper as
described, in the dark-room,
I
removed
a
lead paper from her hands and made,
without warning to Mrs. Deane,
a
new experiment.
I
put on her lap
a
board
about 10-in. x 10-in. with one ledge at the back and one ledge at the front
and having (placed side by side) two pieces of Autotype Co.'s sensitised carbon
tissue (sometimes called Autotype or pigmented tissue, or bichromated
gelatined paper. The gelatine becomes insoluble by the action of light, and by
the action of some chemicals) ivory black half-plate size on the board between

the-0two ledges. Mrs. Deane rested her
wrist on the one ledge and her ﬁnger
tips on the other. I remained in the
dark-room with her, facing the board.
Mrs. Deane had never heard of the
carbon tissue process. I bought the
carbon tissue of the Autotype Company
and opened the packet in the dark-room
there and then. On developing, I
transferred the carbon tissue on to opal
plates supplied by the Autotype Co.,
which I had brought with me. The result
(being gelatine rendered insoluble) was a
faint mark about the size of a shilling,
black in colour, made up of ﬁne points
arranged somewhat in lines, on the one
plate. On the other plate there was a
mark in black and two larger marks with
streaks of a light brown colour with a
shiny, varnished-like surface (Fig. 205).
The medium held her hands over the
tissues for ﬁfteen minutes.
The feet were out
a quarter of an hour.
While Mrs. Deane
was thus sitting I
gave her two pieces
of prussiate paper,
quarter-plate size,
which I had brought
I placed
them back to back,
and got Mrs. Deane
to hold them between her hands, so that
they rested in her left hand, while her
right hand was cupped over the upper
one. Very shortly marks appeared on
both of them.
I then removed the lead paper from
the feet, and found the left foot had pro
duced a similar mark to that produced
on the previous paper by the same foot.
There was a mark also on the paper under

September 1511;, 1924,—I damped with lead acetate solution two pieces
of white paper. I0-in. X 10-in., and placed them one
above the other, both face upwards. Mrs. Deane
placed her naked feet upon the upper one. The
white papers had been placed on eight-fold brown
paper. Mrs. Deane sat, as usual, in the dark-room
on a stool. I was standing opposite her. I placed
a black cloth over her feet to keep them warm and to
keep the red light from the window off them. The lead
paper was folded back over her toes. She sat thus for
half an hour. The result was interesting. The right
foot gave the bigger mark, namely, a band from the
heel to the ball of the big toe, very similar to the mark
given by the left foot last time. In addition, the
right foot had near the heel two strokes forming a cross,
very similar to a pen effect. On the left foot there was
simply a mark half under and half beyond the heel.
The feet had been outlined in pencil. All the marks
were brown in colour. The marks did not penetrate
the paper; nor was the lower paper marked (Fig. 208X
§Iinear). Hand experiments were always made while
her feet were on the paper.

(Fig. 209). I took these pieces of paper away
with me and found that after twenty-four hours
the marks had got much darker, and therefore
stronger.
At the beginning of the sitting I had covered a
piece of white paper, 10-in. X 15-in., with a paste
of starch with 10% KI. I got Mrs. Deane to place

As regards this paper under the feet, there was
a deep brown mark about li-in. X }-in. near the
ball of the right foot on the plain side of the paper,
penetrating only slightly to the starched side, and,
as regards the left foot, there was
a
brown mark
near the heel, but outside the portion of the paper
covered by the foot.
I
then gave her two pieces of starched paper
to hold between her hands.
A
brown mark came
upon one, penetrating to the lower side (Fig. 210).
As
a

I
gave her two pieces of
quarter-plate-size prussiate paper placed back to

pressing her hands on both surfaces. Deep
brown marks came on both papers, two on one,
one on the other. Nothing deﬁnite.

September 22nd, 1924,—Mrs. Deane complained to-day of rheumatism, and
said that she did not think it would be wise to try any more nude feet or feet
experiments at all. I agreed with this, as I did not wish to be the occasion of
any indisposition. At the end of the sitting it was arranged that Mrs. Deane
should insert pieces of paper between her feet and her stockings during a sitting with
me, and put her shoes on again over them,
I had brought with me a 12-in. X 12-in,
artist's canvas stretched in a frame,
the canvas ready prepared for painting;
the object being to duplicate the
phenomena of the Bangs sisters of Chicago.
as described by Admiral Usborne Moore.‘l
This was a surprise put on Mrs. Deane.
I put the canvas against the window pane.
It just ﬁtted in and balanced itself ; and
we sat down close to the window
for a quarter of an hour. Nothing
happened.
(46) At my request Mrs. Deane then sat
on a stool in the dark-room and put the
canvas between her hands, the back of it
on her left hand—placed below—the pre
pared surface upwards. She held the
right hand above the prepared surface of
the canvas, about l-in. away from it.
I stood opposite her, watching. After
some ten minutes or so, a large, brown<
coloured "S" appeared on the canvas
(Fig. 21]). In the illustration the
broader
"
S
"
is to-day's product.
I then substituted for the canvas a
piece of paper prepared on the surface Fig. .m
with phenolphthaleine and nitre, and got
Mrs. Deane to press both hands upon it. Nothing came upon it. This was
to test for negative electricity or any
other decomposition of the nitre, and
also for any alkali in her hand. The
paper remained perfectly white.
(47) I then gave Mrs. Deane a plain
octavo sheet of notepaper, which I had
damped on the underside, and she
I held her right hand over the dry side,
allowing her ﬁnger-tips only to touch
I the paper. Three longitudinal streaks
appeared on the upper surface, two of
I them interrupted, brown in colour
(Fig. 212). I examined the paper in
the light. I returned it to Mrs. Deane
to hold in a similar manner. A traverse
brown streak, above the others, then
appeared (Fig. 212). This may be
regarded as an anticipation of the
suggestion I was about to make of the
Fig. 112 three-legged table.
oGlimpses ofthe Next Slate, London, 19r1.
H 8: F EXPERIMENTS. Purs. (48) t0 (50a) Figs. 213 £0215 Page 125
(48) I then took a piece of prussiate paper,
which I had brought with me, about 16-in. X
5-in., and damped it with water on the white side,
and I folded it in half, transversely, and gave it to
Mrs. Deane to hold between her hands, her hands
being quite ﬂat on both sides, not cupped at
all, pressing the one on the other. I stood
watching all the time. I then kept repeating as
quickly as I could the following words many
times over: “Mrs. Deane has a three-legged
table with three legs and a round top. Mrs. Deane
is going to put the three-legged table with the
round top on the paper." Mrs. Deane laughed*
at this. It amused her. On removing the
paper after ﬁve minutes or so, I found on the
bottom surface three strokes and a circle above
them joining them at the top, the whole
measuring about 2§-in. X 2-in. (Fig. 213). On
the upper surface, touched by the right hand,
appeared a large “5 "
formed of one thick
stroke (Fig. 214). Both these designs were
brown in colour. On washing the paper at
my ofﬁce the brown colour ran a little, the
running appearing reddish-brown.
(49) After the _ o

prussiate paper,

I gave Mrs.
Deane a piece
of note-paper
which I had
Fig- 214 moistened with
a solution of Congo Red, to test for acids
in her hand. I placed the plain side on her
left hand, and she placed her right hand above
it, touching the red surface with her ﬁnger
tips. On this appeared a roundish-circle with
three thin strokes coming from it, the whole Fig. 215
about 2-in. X 2-in. (Fig. 215). Query:
Is it a caricature of the three-legged table? Impossible for Mrs. Deane to
have put on these sketches unobserved by me. Later on it will be seen that
designs appeared of which I thought but which I did not utter._
September 25th, 1924, A dull day. Mrs. Deane fairly free from
complaints and very willing.
(50) I purchased and brought with me a. pair of felt slippers. Mrs. Deane took
off her stockings, and the soles of her feet were wiped with my duster. I placed
under the sole of each naked foot three pieces of ferroprussiate paper, sensitive
side up; the top piece a little wide, so as to envelop, for an inch or so, the
sides of each foot. The top piece was also left a little long so as to form a
tag folded over the toes to prevent the paper slipping. Mrs. Deane put her
stockings on, enclosing the paper, and then the slippers, and sat thus in the
dark-room during my experiments (for nearly two hours).
(50a) I brought with me the frame covered with canvas of the last sitting, with
the
“
S
"
upon it; also, a saucer with three dabs of printers' ink, one red, one
yellow, and one blue ; also three square-sided porcelain cups abQut ﬁ-in. X ﬁ-im,
with water colour paste, rather dry, red, yellow, and blue. These three little

cups I put in the hollow of the saucer. The top surfaces of these cups were
well below the prepared side of the canvas, which I placed on the saucer, so
that the large "S" which occupied the centre of the canvas was within the
circle of the edge of the saucer above the little porcelain containers, the idea
being that the canvas might become coloured. Mrs. Deane placed her hands,
side by side, on the back surface of the canvas. The saucer was resting on a
board placed on Mrs. Deane's lap. I stood opposite her. After a time the
frame, with canvas, moved circularly in the direction of the hands of a clock,
so that Mrs. Deane's hands were at an uncomfortable angle with her arms.
The movement was very slow. The frame then moved back over and past
its original position. Then it came back to its original place, all the time
using the centre of the saucer as the centre of its circular movement. After
sitting like this for half an hour and chatting, a slight tapping was heard,
which we identiﬁed as being the sharp tapping of one of the little porcelain
cups on the saucer. The taps were clear and sharp, and quite single. There
was no clashing of the cups together; single taps, which functioned like table
rapping, and answered questions in the afﬁrmative by three taps. On calling
the alphabet, it responded, and spelt out
“
Feed pounded nuts." Mrs. Deane
had been telling me that her daughter, Vi, was anzemic. I asked, did it intend
to say,
“
Vi was to be fed with pounded nuts"? It answered by three taps
in the affirmative. After another quarter of an hour I removed the frame, with
canvas, and found nothing upon it. The original
"
S
"
was there unaltered.
(50b) I then gave Mrs. Deane a piece of prussiate
paper to hold between her hands. The paper
was 16-in. X 5-in. I folded it in two
(8-in. X 5-in.), sensitive side outwards. The
paper was quite dry, and the folded edge was
. just beyond Mrs. Deane's wrists. Her hands
"
L were placed ﬂat upon the paper and pressed
together. While Mrs. Deane held the paper
f
; three or four minutes:
“
Mrs. Deane is going
01
- ' to put a crescent on the paper (Hulah's crescent),
0' . 0 - 0
a slice of the moon. Mrs. Deane is going to put
ever so many crescents on the paper ; a crescent
hollow one side, bulged on the other, and so on."
Mrs. Deane laughed. On removing the paper from her hands, I found a brown
mark, about l}-in. long and l-in. wide in the widest part, which might, by
courtesy, be called a suggestion of a crescent, on the upper surface, that is.
under the right hand (Fig. 216). There were three small brown marks on the
other surface, that is, the one on the left hand.
(51) I then gave Mrs. Deane the canvas in its frame, to hold between her
hands, the prepared surface on the left hand. She held it for a few minutes only.
On removing it, I found another
"
S
”
the same size as the ﬁrst, over the ﬁrst in
the reverse direction, thus making a kind of 8 with the ﬁrst "5." It was not exactly
like the ﬁrst
“
S," and very much lighter in colour (see Fig. 211 on page 124).
(52) On examining the paper from under the feet, I found nothing on the blue
surfaces at all, but on the edge of one of the upper pieces on the white side,
which had occupied a more or less vertical position, I found a dark brown mark
(F
ig.
217), similar in size and appearance to the crescent on the blue paper under
the hands.
I
removed the blue papers myself from Mrs. Deane's stockings. Note
the paper was inside the stockings.
(53) September 29th, 1924,—Mrs. Deane bared her feet.
I
wiped the soles
and placed
a
piece of ferroprussiate paper with the sensitive side against each
sole. She put on her stockings over these and slippers over all. She kept her

feet thus covered during all to-day's experiments.
At the end of the sitting Mrs. Deane removed her stockings in my presence.
On one piece of the prussiate paper was a large (2-in. X Il-in.) deep brown mark
at the heel. The mark turned nearly black.
Mrs. Deane had certainly no opportunity of marking this paper or the last.
(54) I gave Mrs. Deane a piece of dry prussiate paper about 16-in. X5-in.,
folded back to back, making the surfaces 8-in.X5-in. and placed the piece
between her two hands, the fold near the wrist. I had told her at the beginning
of the sitting to think of her dog
“
Boofy." I had brought a rough sketch of a
triangle with two large dots for the eyes and one for the snout (just dots), which
I put in front of her. When she held the blue paper in the dark-room, I standing
opposite her, her feet were still encased in the blue paper. I kept repeating
over and over again for several minutes :
"
Mrs. Deane is going to put a triangle
on the paper with two dots for eyes and one for snout," as fast as I could say it.
Mrs. Deane laughed. After ten minutes I opened the door and examined
the paper top and bottom. There was nothing on it except a bluish mark
of the hand.
I gave it back to her, and I stood opposite her, and asked her to hold it again
in the dark-room, where we had remained. In a few minutes I looked at the
paper again and found on the upper
surface (under her right hand), an
elongated triangle with three dots
within the corners (Fig. 218A), and
on the lower surface there was a
suggestion of two triangles with one
side in common (Fig. 2188).
(55) I then gave Mrs. Deane two
pieces of glass half-plate size, coated
on one side with starch paste con
taining 10% of KI. I placed them
back to back. Her hands were
touching, but cupped. After ten
minutes I removed the glasses and
examined them. In the portion
covered by Mrs. Deane's hands the
whiteness of the starch paste had
given place to a darker, more r 0-
,
transparent appearance. I then
C Fog0 “8
gave her the plates again to hold,
still in the dark-room, while I watched proceedings. After a few minutes I
took the glass plates and examined them by daylight. I found on each a distinct
brown triangle. One is shown here. (Fig. 218C.)
(55a) CommenL—Impossible for Mrs. Deane to have put on these triangles in a
normal way without my seeing her do it. Doubly so as to the starched glass.
(56) I then gave her a packet of eight sheets of plain wax paper, 6l-in. X
Iii-in. She held them between her hands for ﬁve minutes. The result was
small black marks on the top sheet and some lines on an inner sheet.
This was the ﬁrst wax paper experiment I made. An extraordinary
crackling noise was heard while the wax paper was being held, like a tornado
of electric sparks. Exactly similar noises have been heard by other
experimenters with other mediums, as I read later.*
* In P5_\0cImgraf>h_l'on p. 50, the author, MA. (Oxon), cites a report of psychic writing being
accompanied by the sound of a stream of electric sparks. See footnote p. r18.

October 2nd, 1924,—On this day a friend of mine interested in psychic
research attended with me. We had some of the usual experiments, but on
account of the dark-room being so small, my friend sat in the doorway, with
the door ajar, letting in daylight. To this I attribute the absence of results
worth recording. We had a few taps only.
Odober 6th, 1924,—Mrs. Deane got some hot water and washed her hands
with soap in my presence and wiped them thoroughly on my clean duster.
(564) At the beginning of the sitting I had put against the ruby window a card
board disc ll-in. in diameter with thirty-six round holes, g-in. each in diameter,
near the edge fairly close together, making a circle of holes. Mrs. Deane was
facing this and her mind was being impressed by it. After the ﬁrst experiment
(bungled) I gave her a piece of ferroprussiate paper, 16-in. X 5-in., folded in
two, making 8-in. X 5-in. surfaces, which she held between her hands. I then
repeated for some minutes the words

greasy nature of the surface. Needless to say that under the conditions of
the experiment it was impossible for Mrs. Deane to have ’used such an instrument
unnoticed by me.
(59) Comment .0 This is another experience which forces the conclusion upon
me that someone I cannot see is using things I cannot see to make marks ; and
my many experiences since this date have strengthened this conviction, which
applies also to psychic photographs both with Mrs. Deane and Mr. Hope.
October 9th, 1924,—The friend mentioned as attending the sitting with me
on October 2nd, came again to-day. He again sat in the doorway, admitting
much daylight. We were again unsuccessful as regards results. There were
slight taps. There was, however, one interesting feature about to-day's sitting.
I had given Mrs. Deane a packet of sixteen sheets of waxed paper to hold between
her hands. _ There was no sound at all from the paper, no crackling, until I told
a joke I had read in Punch. This caused Mrs. Deane and my friend to laugh*.
(60) It is curious that directly we laughed, there issued, as it appeared,
from the paper between Mrs. Deane's hands, a lot of crackling, reminding one of a
shower of electric sparks from a Leyden-jar, and my friend suggested I should
tell some more jokes. We got a few more sounds as of sparks and then silence.
It will be remembered that I recorded similar sounds from the wax paper
in the report of September 29th, (56).
My friend would not admit any abnormal origin for the sound. I have
not been able to imitate such a sound. Only prolonged experience and contact
with abnormal facts enables one to believe in their existence. I must say I think
this shows prejudice. I know not how to imitate such a stream of sparks without
an electrical apparatus.
October 13th, 1924,—-Mrs. Deane complained of having been very unwell. I
had brought a piece of sheet iron with me, 10-in. X 12-in., which I warmed with
hot water. On this I placed three pieces of ferroprussiate paper all face
upwards, slightly larger than the iron. I pinned them to a wooden box,
10-in.X 12-in. X3-in., placed under the iron, at the four corners, with drawing
pins. Mrs. Deane had prepared a pair of woollen stockings by cutting the
soles away, leaving just enough to grip the toes. She bared her feet and put these
on. I examined the soles of her feet and wiped them with my duster brought
with me. She placed her legs inside a tube or wall of felt, 15-in. high, which
I had placed round the box. I took care that she did not touch her feet. Her
skirt was put over the felt wall. I tied the felt round the footstool, although
the felt was a fairly tight ﬁt round the box. She sat thus for about one-and
three-quarter hours in the dark-room with her feet inside the felt on the papers
while we carried out other experiments.
I had cut out of a piece of cardboard, 12-in.X12-in., the letter
"
H
"
with
the lines about l-in. wide. I put this against the ruby window to impress the
letter "H "
on Mrs. Deane's mind, calling attention to it several times during
the sitting. Some experiments made with papers between hands; no results.
(61) I then superintended Mrs. Deane's withdrawing her feet from the appara
tus and carried the apparatus outside. I removed the felt and found bluish
impressions of her feet on all the three pieces of paper. On the top sheet in
addition there were brown lines (not a skin impression) where the left foot had
been, in the arch of the foot about 1l-in.Xl-in. On the impression of the right
foot there were two sharp lines crossing one another behind the ball of the
big toe, brown in colour, one Ila-in. wide, the other ﬁner and each about li-in.
long—distinct marks as if made by some instrument. Mrs. Deane had no
opportunity of making such marks normally.
o With reference to the advantage of causing mediums for physical effects to laugh, it is
curious but I myself came to this conclusion without the knowledge of similar experience
having been recorded, see also Footnote on p. r 30.

November 17th, 1924,—This is the ﬁrst sitting since October 13th.
0
Mrs. Deane was full of the Cenotaph psychic photo she took on November 11th,
and the newspaper men who had accused her of trickery. Her mind was
replete with it. She kept on talking of nothing else. She said she dreamt of
it, and every minute she was turning it about in different ways. Mrs. Deane
said she did not think I should get anything to-day as she was too excited.
(614) I then tried a piece of ferroprussiate paper damped on the white side and
folded, placed between Mrs. Deane's hands as usual. I said I was going to try
to get an
“
I-I
"
upon it, so I kept repeating
“ " H," “for “
Hulah," two uprights
and a cross-bar. I made Mrs. Deane laugh‘I
[I have come to consider a laugh very helpful]
by my constant iteration. I suggested a hymn
to quieten Mrs. Deane. We sang "Abide with
me." On examining the blue paper, for it was
rather old and blue, I found some broken
marks upon it, with a resemblance to half of
a capital "H." (Fig. 222). I stood opposite
her all the time, looking at her hands. The
original mark was on the lower side resting on
her left hand.
“rs. Deane would not admit that the
Fig. 222 Daily Skcich faces of footballers, etc., were
those of her psychic photo. As regards
“
Siki," she said all negroes were much alike to an outsider.
(61b) Comment—.\Iy view, for whatever it may be worth, is that the faces may
well be those of newspaper illustrations. My investigations have taught me
that it is highlyprobable that the 0operator' does produce such Extras
supernormally from mundane material, unknown to the mediumﬁl
November 24th, 1924,—Mrs. Deane still very much upset about the Daily
Size/ch criticisms of the Cenotaph photo.
Second experiment-Sixteen sheets of wax paper held between Mrs. Deane's
hands. Crackling sound once only. No other result. With the waxed paper
I suggested the letter "H."
(61¢) I then gave her a piece of ferro
prussiate paper to hold, about 16-in. X 5-in.,
folded in half, damped on the white side,
fold towards the wrist as usual; left hand
below, right hand above ; my hands over
and under .Mrs. Deane's. I saw her wipe her
hands with a clean duster I brought with
me, immediately before this experiment.
During this experiment I kept on repeating
"
Mrs. Deane is going to put
'
H
'
for
'
Hulah,'
' . Mrs. Deane is going to put
0
H
'
on the paper."
Fis- 223 I kept this up all the time of the experiment,
for about a quarter of an hour. 0n removing the paper I found, near the edge,
on the lower side, that on her left hand, two bars about Tax-in. wide, parallel and
sloping, with a cross-bar at the top (Fig. 223). Evidently an attempt at a
capital 0H.'

(62) December 15th, 1924,—Mrs. Deane much upset by an article attacking
her which had appeared in a journal. Mrs. Deane was so upset that she told me
she should discuss with Miss Stead the giving up of psychic photography.
Third experiment—Glass plate with starch and KI. I told Mrs. Deane I
was going to try to get a ﬁgure, an Arabic
“
2," not a Roman
"
2," to-day, and
explained what I meant by Arabic, as she did not know the term. I drew a
"
2
"
with my ﬁnger just by the ruby window, so that she should see it and
visualise it. This was done chieﬂy to prepare her for a further experiment to-day.
No result with the starched glass.
The results obtained in the following experiment are, I consider,
exceptionally evidential. I do not see how they could have been produced
normally under the conditions.
(63) Fourth experirnent—‘I damped the white surface of a piece of ferro
prussiate paper, about 16-in. X 5-in., and folded it to 8-in. X 5-in., and dated it.
I went into the dark-room with it and put it between Mrs. Deane's hands, fold
towards the wiistsas before. I stood opposite Mrs. Deane, quite close to her. I
then started suggesting the
“
2." I kept on saying
"
2, 2, 2, 2, 2," and I drew
a
“
2
”
with my fore-ﬁnger against the ruby glass, and said,
"
Mrs. Deane will
put a 02' on the paper on both sides." Mrs. Deane laughed at my constant
repetition. I kept this up for ten minutes. I kept saying
"
An Arabic 2, not
a Roman II." After ten minutes I took the paper away from Mrs. Deane and
opened the dark-room door ; I found on the top of the paper, that under the right
- hand, a distinct
“
2
"
made with a very ﬁne
line, blue in colour about l-in. in height
(Fig. 224). It was as if a thin line had been
photographed thereon by light, that is to
say, it was the blue produced on such paper
by the action of light. I cannot conceive
how it could have been done normally under
the conditions. I should have observed any
action of Mrs. Deane's necessary to produce
Fig. 224 such a
"
2." Her hands were steady on the
paper all the time. I was most careful to pay constant attention In addition
there were two strokes about i-in. long, parallel to one another, %-in. apart
(Fig. 224). There were ﬁnger-marks in blue also—not exactly ﬁnger-marks
but blue marks of irregular outline. On the side of
the paper touching the left hand there were also blue
marks made by the ﬁngers. In addition there was this
curious thing which could not have been done normally
under the conditions. There were eight ﬁne strokes, not
exactly alike, arranged in pairs at the corners of an
imaginary square with sides about I-in. long, the square
being a perfect square, suggesting four times 2 or 2’ ; (Fig.
225) ; I had thus four 2's on one side and the two strokes
and the Arabic number 2 on the other. On the left hand
side I had, in addition to the four pairs of dots, a ﬁne
line not very visible, representing a cross between an S
and a 2. I should remark that the Arabic
“
2” could
not have been done by a pencil. It is in the paper, not
on it (see Fig. 224). I took everything away with me as
usual. The weather was dull, but not foggy. We had
the electric stove on. As the marks are somewhat faint
they have been touched-up slightly in the half-tones. The
originals are available.

December 18th, 1924.—Mrs. Deane in good form, but still sore about the
article I mentioned in my last report.
(64) The following experiment is one which I consider strongly evidential.
0-—
‘
Second experiment—A packet of sixteen sheets of
wax paper held between Mrs. Deane's hands as before;
result very slight crackling; no marks on the paper
except that on the sixth page inside from the left hand
there appeared an Arabic ﬁgure
"
6
"
in white. I had been
suggesting to Mrs. Deane that a
“
6
"
should come upon the
paper. I said "6, 6, 6," and drew a “6" in front of her.
I accidentally left the wax paper behind. On January 5th I
examined this wax paper (see page 133) and found that the
"
6" had turned dark brown. It is a perfect
"
6," as seen in
the illustration (Fig. 226).
(65) Fonrth experiment—I took a piece of ferroprussiate paper,
about 16-in. X 5-in. and damped it on the white side. I folded it to 8-in. X 5-in.
I marked it with the date, and R and L for right and left hand as usual. I put
it under Mrs. Deane's hands with the blue surfaces inside. She remarked upon
this and I took it away from her in the dark-room and proceeded to fold it
right way round ; then I changed my mind and said
"
No, we will try the white
side out," so I placed the paper on Mrs. Deane's left hand, white side out. She
put her right hand on the top of the upper surface and pressed the hands
together. Before starting this experiment I examined her hands and rubbed
them with the duster myself. Her hands were clean, as she had been doing
some washing-up downstairs. Placing myself opposite to her I watched her hands
carefully all the time. The sun had come out, so the cabinet was fairly light
. and she did not move her hands; all the more certain
therefore she did not open the paper. For fully ten minutes
I repeated the number
"
6," saying," Mrs. Deane, will you
put the 06' on the paper," and as the operator in these
experiments was said by
“ Brown Wolf," Mrs. Deane's
control, to be a Frenchman, I repeated several times the
suggestion in French. Pronouncing the
"
6
"
soft in French
it sounded like the letter
“
C." The result was I got a
broad mark about Tag-in. thick stroke and l}-in. high of a
" 6," with the loop incomplete, a cross between a
“
6
"
and
a
"
C." (Fig. 227). This was on the blue side on the inner
surface of the upper piece. It was blue in colour and there
was a dark bluish brown spot in the centre of the loop.
Now this spot and the loop or "6” were repeated faintly
on the lower blue surface which touched the upper one. All
these marks were dry and the blue surface of the paper was
dry. The paper had been only slightly damped and was wholly dry at the end of
the experiment. Having examined the paper I gave it to Mrs. Deane again
to hold with the object of increasing the markings; the inside marks were not
increased, but there were some slight brown marks in the neighbourhood of the
ﬁngers on both white surfaces.
Fig. 226
(65a) CommenL—There were no brown marks on the white side of the paper
after experiment No. 4; therefore Mrs. Deane's ﬁngers were not stained, and
the brown marks which came later after the ﬁrst examination of the paper by
me were put on, I consider, during the later holding, as are many brown marks.
Besides, it was impossible for her to have put the mark inside between the
leaves without my observing her do it. I was carrying out this experiment
with the express object of getting at the truth of the Deane phenomena, and
HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (6'6) (67) Page 133
should not have continued my arduous labours if I had the least doubt of the
genuineness of the things of which I was a witness. My time is too valuable to
me to waste in a fruitless manner. I continued my work solely because I was
convinced of the genuineness of what happened. I have no inclination to
deceive myself, nor to deceive others.
January 5th, 1925,—We this day recommenced our sittings, suspended on
December 18th. First four experiments with no result.
I then put between Mrs. Deane's hands a piece of prussiate paper, damped
and folded, blue side outwards. I kept on suggesting the ﬁgure
"
8" during
nearly the whole of the sitting, but all with no avail.
When I left the door open after the last experiment, Mrs. Deane was still
sitting on the stool and she noticed and called my attention to a packet of
wax paper on the lowest shelf adjacent. She said she had not used the cabinet
since the last sitting, except for developing a photograph of her dog
'
Boofy,'
using the top shelf. The packet of wax paper which I had used on the last
occasion had been accidentally left behind by me on the lowest shelf in the
dark room. I had noticed on the last occasion that on one of the interior pages
the ﬁgure
"
6" had been put, but it was very faint. I found the
“
6” now
coloured spottily in brown (this darkening has happened frequently) and in
addition there was a dark brown
“
6," about the size of a sixpence, on two
adjacent interior pieces.
January 8th, 1925,—Fine day. Mrs. Deane in good form.
(66) Second experimenL—J gave Mrs. Deane papers, held once to-day,
to hold again, to try to increase the marks. While she was holding them
I opened the door and took two steps to the electric stove to fetch a glass plate
which was drying. I took the paper away from Mrs. Deane and examined the ﬁrst
markings to see whether they had been increased, for the object of the second
holding was to increase the marks. I found they had not been increased. The
door was open when I examined the papers and found nothing on them but the
slight marks of the ﬁrst experiment, and I retained the paper in my left hand,
while with my right hand I put the plate with the starch between Mrs. Deane's
hands. I left her alone in the cabinet with the door shut holding the starched plate
while I remained in the main room in a good, but not brilliant, light. I was still
holding the packet of paper in the main room, and I rolled it somewhat together,
cogitating whether 1 would put it in my bag to keep it from the light. Now a
very strange thing happened. I was cogitating about the paper and allowed the
packet to uncurl and open itself. I cast my eyes upon it and was astonished to
see a bright yellow mark upon it, about l-in. X §in., formed of two halves like
a cottage loaf, only taller, the upper half being a circle with a centre, the lower
half being a circle without a centre, evidently an abortive
“
8." It was wet.
I had not put the paper down at all, nor had I touched anything which could
have marked the paper. There is no doubt that this
“
8
"
came upon the
paper while I was holding it. There was a bottle of concentrated Rodinal on
the shelf ; it was corked ; I turned it up and wetted the cork and made an
“
8
"
with the wet cork on the same paper. This produced a mark very much like
the one which appeared in such a strange manner, but the Rodinal mark was
distinctly redder. I washed them in plain water and the marks became
practically identical, bright yellowish with a bluish grey shade in parts. During
to-day's experiments I had been suggesting that the ﬁgure
“
8
"
should come
on the various papers. This apported or telekinetic(?) "8" ultimately became
white, thus differing from all the other brown marks.
(67) Fourth experimenL—Wax paper held between Mrs. Deane's hands; we
had much crackling of the paper of a sharp, clear sound which I cannot imitate,
but no marks appeared upon it.
Page 134 Figs. 228, 229 Pars. (68) (69) H a F EXPERIMENTS.
(68) January 12th, 1925,~l:oggy morning; the room was quite dark.
T0-day I carried out several experiments with Mrs. Deane, but as the morning
was very foggy and the room therefore very dark I will not report about this
sitting except as regards the fourth experiment. I took two pieces of ferro
prussiate paper folded, making eight pages. I placed these pieces of paper
between Mrs. Deane's hands and stood opposite her. I had been suggesting
all this morning that the ﬁgure
"
8" should come on the various materials.
During this last experiment I kept on suggesting the ﬁgure
“
8," telling
Mrs. Deane to visualise it, and kept on repeating
"
8, 8, 8," for ten minutes.
I guarded Mrs. Deane's hands with my own, placing one above and one below hers.
She had no opportunity of doing anything with her hands without my becoming
aware of it. I took these two pieces of paper from her
before I opened the door of the dark-room. I took the
paper then and there, without giving her any notice.
She had no idea when I was likely to break in on the
experiment. On going into the large room I found a
large
"
8
"
on the uppermost surface, the surface under
her right hand, of a deep brown colour, quite dry. There
was no vestige of moisture. The stroke was about Tag-in.
wide (Fig. 228).
T0-day I was admitted by Mrs. Robson, who lives
on the top ﬂoor, and was half an hour in the studio
by myself before Mrs. Deane arrived. This is by no
means the ﬁrst time I have had ample opportunity to
investigate and pry about everywhere.
, January 15th, 1925,—F10rst experiment--Ferroprussiate
Fig. 228 paper held between Mrs. Deane's hands ; result, some
slight blue marks appeared on the top and bottom pieces.
Second cxperiment—A packet of twelve sheets of silk glazed paper held
between Mrs. Deane's hands; there was a lot of crackling. This experiment
lasted half an hour. During all the experiments to-day I suggested a hand
should come on the material used. There were some slight brown marks on
an outer sheet.
(69) I placed prussiate papers between her hands, carefully observing
the whole time. She had washed her hands and removed the starch after a
starch experiment, and wiped them on the duster I had brought. She wiped
her hands again before this last experiment and I
examined her hands carefully to see they were clean.
I took great care to watch Mrs. Deane's hands the whole
time.
During this experiment I kept on repeating,
“
Mrs. Deane will put a hand on the paper, four ﬁngers
and a thumb." I held my hand before the ruby window
with the digits spread out. I suggested four lines for the
ﬁngers and a thick line for the thumb, radiating like a
fan, but, as if to show me that the
'
control
'
would not
submit to dictation (.9), a mark was put on, which
certainly resembles a side view of the lower end of the
arm, with the hand bent (Fig. 229). It was of a deep
brownish colour. This appeared on the topmost

a paper, which had been suspended, and bore a brown mark with some crystals,
the crystals disappeared and produced a deep blood-red stain in the water.
Quite a lot of colour was produced. There were no crystals on the No. 3 paper
with the hand design, and there was no red colour at all on washing it.
January 19th, 1925. —Mrs. Deane complained of not having slept a wink
the night before.
(70) First experimenL—I took with me some cartridge paper, which I
had prepared with ferroprussiate solution this morning. I used four pieces
16
"
X 5' folded in two as usual. The paper was treated on both sides. I marked
the four pieces 1, 2, 3, and 4, and placed them in a packet, No. 1 at the top,
No. 2 below, No. 3 below that, and No. 4 at the bottom. The numbered side
in each case was uppermost. I had taken with me a piece of corrugated card
board as used for packing. It was about 12-in. wide and about 24-in. long.
I scored across the corrugations and folded it over, so as to form a ﬂat tunnel,
corrugated surface inside, the idea being to cover Mrs. Deane's hands with this
while she was holding the paper, so that there should be absolutely no possibility
for her to touch anything with her ﬁngers had she wished to do so. I examined
Mrs. Deane's hands, and saw her wipe them thoroughly with a clean duster I had
brought with me. I took great care that there was no opportunity for Mrs. Deane
to mark the paper. I never left her presence, and observed the covering of her
hands the whole time. Directly after the hands were wiped, the four pieces
of paper (the surface numbered No. 1 uppermost, under her right hand) were
placed between her hands and I put the cardboard tunnel round her hands.
It reached well up over the wrist. The overlapping ends of the cardboard
were pinned together. It became thus a closed affair, except as regards the
two open ends. This experiment lasted half an hour in the photographic dark
room. The day was fairly light. I suggested we should get a hand, four
ﬁngers and a thumb, with the hand stretched out from the nose, what is
called cocking a snook. After half an hour Mrs. Deane withdrew her hands.
I took the tunnel with the prussiate paper into the main room. The result
was as follows :—
Sheet No. 1, nothing. Sheet No. 2, a brownish-black smudge li-in. long X
l-in. wide, with a blackish-brown cloudiness round it. This was on the upper
surface, marked No. 2, but below sheet No. 1 of course, that is to say on an
inner page. Mrs. Deane could not have done this, as the tunnel was too narrow
to admit of any manipulation. Sheet No. 3, nil. Sheet No. 4, on the lower
surface, that touching Mrs. Deane's left hand, were a number of brownish
black ﬁne markings, nothing deﬁnite.
January 22nd, 1925.—Fine day. Mrs. Deane in good form, except as
regards a bad cold.
(71) First ExperimenL—I had prepared some cartridge paper with ferro
prussiate and folded as described on the last occasion. I took four folded pieces,
Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4, with the numbered surfaces uppermost as before. Mrs. Deane
washed her hands in front of me and wiped them with my duster. I examined
her hands and passed my own over hers immediately before giving her the
packet of four double sheets to hold between her two hands, the right hand
on the top. I had ready the cardboard tunnel described in the last report, and
immediately slid it over her hands. The tunnel is not high enough to allow
of any manipulation by the hands, i.e., Mrs. Deane could not touch any but
the uppermost and lowest sheets. We were in the cabinet, which, to-day, was
not too light. I stood opposite her during the experiment. In addition to
my surveillance with my eyes and hands, my ears would have caught any
suspicious sound.
Page 136 Figs. 230, 231 Pars. (71a) to (73) H & F EXPERIMENTS.
I suggested getting a hand again to-day, tour ﬁngers and a thumb.
After half an hour I took the cardboard in my
hands. Mrs. Deane slid her hands out, leaving the paper
within the cardboard. On the top surface of No. 2
sheet, i.e., the third surface down (an inner surface),
were two deep brown marks, Iii-in. X {-in, and
l-in. X }-in" quite dry, which might be taken for
ﬁngers, they had not marked the superincumbent page
(Fig. 230). This is a most important fact.
(71¢) Comment—L0nder the conditions it was
impossible for Mrs. Deane to touch an inner surface of
the packet of papers, yet the strong mark was found
on an inner surface and it was not offset, as the printers
say, on to the superincumbent paper, which is indeed
strange, as the two marks have every appearance of a
Fis- 230 liquid origin ; nor has the colour penetrated the paper
to the back. THE IMPORTANT FACT OF THE

January 29th, 1925.—Nothing of interest or value.
(72) Third experiment—A glass plate was coated with starch paste and KI
by me in the room before we began. It was still wet.
It
was lying in
a
shallow
box bottom. Mrs. Deane held the box in her left hand, with her right over
it
in the dark-room for
a
quarter of an hour. A few of the usual round brown
spots appeared.
A
control plate of starch paste and KI gave no discoloration
at all. The light brown spots increased at my ofﬁce.
I
noticed afterwards
the presence of one or two minute refractive crystals in the brown spots.
(73) Fourth experimenL—I took
a
packet of ferroprussiate paper, dry, but
not bone dry; this
I
placed between Mrs. Deane's hands.
I
suggested all
kinds of hands. The result was some brown markings on the top blue paper,
four thick rods coming from
a
common centre, and deep-brown mark,
lﬁ-in. X li-inn on an inner page.

February 2nd, 1925,—Weather ﬁne. Mrs. Deane in good form. I took the
usual precaution of looking round the dark-room shelves, wiping Mrs. Deane's
hands with my duster brought with me, etc. As it was very bright, I drew
the curtain across the main window. Before each experiment I saw Mrs. Deane
wipe her hands on my duster, and I examined her hands. During each
experiment I stood opposite her in the small dark-room.
(74) First experiment—I had brought two pieces of plain cartridge paper with
me which I had folded in half, so that there were four leaves of paper. I dated
them and numbered the upper surface of each. Mrs. Deane held these between
her hands for half an hour and chatted a lot.
While Mrs. Deane was holding this plain paper I suggested we should try
again to get a hand, four ﬁngers and a thumb, or ﬁve spokes of a wheel, one
thick one to represent a
thumb, (This might be
taken for six, viz. : ﬁve
and one thick one.)
After half an hour I
took the paper from
Mrs. Deane's hand and
opened the door. On
the top surface, under
her right hand, there
were six bars in light
brown, about li-in. X
%-in., all radiating (Fig.
232). If these marks
were put on by a ﬁnger
the action would have
been seen by me, and
the six marks would

_ were dry. The plain
F‘g- 232 cartridge paperI always
used dry. I was opposite her all the time, watching care
fully. On an inside page there was a faint
“
S." (Fig.233.)
(75) Second experimenL—Twelve sheets of wax paper
held between Mrs. Deane's hands for a quarter of an
hour; no result. A dark-brown mark appeared inside
some days later.
Third experiment.—I took a glass plate, half-plate
size, covered with starch paste with 5% KI still wet.
I placed this in the bottom half of a box making an open
tray ; I tied a piece of string round the box at two-thirds
distance from Mrs. Deane's wrist, so that her ﬁngers
could rest upon it without touching the plate. I still
suggested a hand should come. After half an hour I
took the whole away into the main room and found
Fig. 233 there were a few dark brown marks on the starch. On
leaving the box open in the room the stains increased in
number and darkness. An identical control plate warmed by the electric stove
had no stains upon it at all.
(76) Fourth experiment—I took two pieces of ferroprussiate paper folded in
half, one inside the other, making eight pages. These papers were numbered
Page 138 Fig. 234 Pars. (77) to (78) H8: I: EXPERIMENTS.
by me. While Mrs. Deane held the papers between her hands, I suggested
vigorously that we should get a hand. After a quarter of an hour I took the
papers away from Mrs. Deane and opened the door. I found that the paper
had brownish marks on the top surface. On the lower surface, namely, that
touching the left hand, there were bluish brown marks, and there were two or
three marks on an inside page.
February 51h, 1925,—Weather bright. I drew the curtain across the
window. Mrs. Deane in good form, but worried.
Second experimenL—A packet of wax paper between hands. There were
loud cracklings nearly the whole quarter of an hour, but nothing showed upon
the paper.
-
Third experimenL—Plates of glass, covered at my
ofﬁce with starch with 5% KI. I had two plates,
exactly similar, each in a cardboard tray. Mrs. Deane
held one with her right hand over it, and I held the
other exactly the same, both for a quarter of an hour.
I suggested a hand or ﬁve spokes. On Mrs. Deane's plate
small, rodlike spots appeared. On my plate there was
nothing. On Mrs. Deane's plate further brown spots
appeared later on in the main room, and more at my
office afterwards. Nothing came afterwards on my plate.
It remained perfectly white.
(77) Fourth experimenL—I then gave Mrs. Deane four
pieces of ferroprussiate paper to hold between her
hands, while I stood watching her, suggesting a hand,
or ﬁve spokes of a wheel, should appear. Quarter of an
hour. Result : ﬁve double radiating bars, light brown
on an inside page, facing upwards (Fig. 234).
(77a) Comment—Quite impossible for Mrs. Deane to
Fig. 234 have put these marks unseen by me, as is evident.
February 10th, 1925,—Mrs. Deane complained of want of sleep.
(77b) First experiment—Mrs. Deane sat in the dark-room by herself. I made it
darker than usual. No control of any kind during this experiment. I gave
Mrs. Deane a piece of good quality smooth cardboard, about ll-in. X 5-in., to
hold between her hands. I sat outside the cabinet close to her, and read to
her some part of Illiss Kelmansegg and Her Precious Leg, by Hood, and told
her I wanted her to put a leg on the cardboard. The surfaces were quite plain,
but she may have thought by my remarks they were prepared in some way.
After reading I repeated several times
"
Mrs. Deane is going to put a leg on
the paper, from the knee downwards, calf, ankle, heel and toes.” Mrs. Deane
sat with the cardboard for thirty-ﬁve minutes. On the lower surface, that in
contact with her left hand was a curved mark, about 3-in. >< 5-in., which was
somewhat like a leg without a heel (Fig. 240A, page 143). It was a very light yellow
colour of various shades. In a few hours it turned much darker. The shaded
colouring gives it a quite unusual character.
(78) Fourth experimenL—I gave Mrs. Deane two pieces of folded ferroprussiate
paper dry, sensitised on both sides, one placed on the other. I saw her wipe
her hands on my duster before this experiment, and I stood opposite her the
whole time, keeping guard. She held the paper between her hands, which were
ﬂat against it, for ﬁfteen minutes. The result was no marks on the
exterior of the papers, but one largish mark, at a great stretch it might be an
attempt at an "L" reversed and a small round mark on one inner surface; a
round mark only, corresponding with the ﬁrst, was on the opposite inner surface.
The
“
I.
"
was not impressed 0n the contiguous surface.

February 1 7th, 1925.—Weather fair and cold ; electric stove alight.
First experiment—I took a long strip of cartridge paper about 5-in. X 21-in.
and folded it back l-in. in the length, so that a piece of string would lie in the
fold. I tied this round Mrs. Deane's head, over the forehead; I call this a
"
Headband
"
(Fig. 184, page 110).
(79) I then gave Mrs. Deane the two pieces of cartridge paper folded to hold
in her hands, the fold towards her wrist, each piece folded and separate;
marked 1 and 2. I examined her hands immediately before, very carefully,
and got her to wipe them with a clean duster I had brought with me. I then
enclosed her hands in a rectangular cardboard tunnel which I had brought with
me, of corrugated cardboard, corrugations inside, measuring ll-in. long, 8-in.
wide, 2§-in. high. Her hands were thus imprisoned.
(80) Previously to this I pinned up a piece of cartridge paper. about 21-in. X
12-in., on the edge of the top shelf, so that it hung in proximity to Mrs. Deane's
left side. I stood opposite to her. We chatted away for forty minutes ; every now
and again I suggested we should get a leg on the paper. I said
"
Calf, Shin,
Ankle; Heel, Instep and Toes." At the end of this time Mrs. Deane withdrew
her hands from the tube, leaving the paper inside the cardboard. I took that
and the paper from her head. I found on the upper surface of the second sheet
of the cartridge, that is, on an inside page, a light yellow mark
(it
became dark
brown), about 2-in. long and g-in. wide, somewhat of the shape of an
“
L"
(“
L” for leg) (Fig. 240C, page 143). On the lowest surface of the sheet numbered
2,
that on her left hand, there was also an
"
L" (Fig. 241E, page 143) and some
marks of
a
similar colour, but in some places darker. These two
"
L's
”
became
of quite different shades of brown. Two of the patches had the colour of thin
blood.
On the paper round her head, on the outside surface, about the middle of
the forehead, was an
“
L" about l-in. high and {-in. broad (Fig. 240B, page 143).
(804) Third experimenL—I then gave Mrs. Deane two pieces of plain ground
glass, half-plate size, with the smooth surfaces together. She thought they
were starched glasses.
I
put the cardboard tunnel over her hands and she sat
for half an hour—I stood opposite her in the dark-room. Result: An "L" (Fig.
240D, page 143) and an
"'
S."
February 19th, 1925.—Weather bright and ﬁne. Mrs. Deane in good health.
(81) First experiment—Cartridge paper
I
had brought with me, two pieces
folded, making four sheets, about 9-in. X 5-in.
I
examined Mrs. Deane's hands care
fully
;
I
wiped them with
a
duster
I
had brought with me
;
I
gave Mrs. Deane the
paper to hold, and put the cardboard tube, as described above
(I
brought
this with me) over her hands.
I
put
a
head-paper round her head, tied on with
string.
I
stood opposite Mrs. Deane in the small dark-room. We chatted for
forty minutes.
I
suggested during part of the time that we should get
a
leg
again. It had come into my head during the morning at home, to suggest
a
perfect circle,
a
circle which Mrs. Deane could not make by free-hand drawing, so
during the suggestion
I
said
"
or
a
circle,
a
perfect circle, a perfect circle as drawn
by compasses, or
a
ring." At the end of the forty minutes
Mrs. Deane withdrew her hands from the tube, leaving the
paper therein.
I
took possession of the tube and the head
band.
I
found on the top piece (1), under her right hand,
a
third of
a
circle, about §-in. in diameter, of
a
dark-brown
colour (Fig. 235). Mrs. Deane came out of the room to
warm herself at the stove. She wore two gold rings on one
ﬁnger.
I
asked her to take them off. The outer one was
removed with difﬁculty. One of them was the exact
Page 140 Fig. 236 Pars. (810) to (83) HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS.
measurement of the circle. Mrs. Deane could not manipulate within the tube
without my being aware of the movement of her hands. Had she tried, the
paper would assuredly have become crumpled.
(81a) C0mment—-The inner surface of the cardboard was corrugated, so there
was no ﬂat surface on which to impress the ring, which, under the conditions, she
could not have removed from her ﬁnger, nor could she have gained access to any
ﬂuid colour. I had not asked for a ring or circle recently, so no preparation
was likely to have been made. It is out of the question that she could have
carried out this thing with her hands imprisoned in the ﬂat parallel-piped tube.
(81b) Third experiment—I gave Mrs. Deane the two half-plate focussing screens,
used last time. There was still the small mark from the last occasion on the
upper one. I told her they were plain (non-starched) ground glasses. They
were placed rougli sides outwards. I examined Mrs. Deane's hands and wiped
them before each experiment on my own duster. I did not give Mrs. Deane the
glasses nor did I replace the head-band until I was ready to close the door.
I placed the cardboard tube over her hands. I forgot to mention, that during
the last experiment, while Mrs. Deane's hands were in the tube, something
struck the head-band. We both heard
it,
but
it
left no mark.
I
kept
suggesting a leg,
a
ring and
a
circle. Mrs. Deane with
drew her hands from the tube, leaving the glasses inside.
I
took the tube and the head-band and examined them
in the main room.
I
found on the head-band
a
light
yellowish brown mark and nothing on the upper glass,
but on the lower glass there were two elongated
“
S's
"
about ll-in. long and l}-in. long respectively, the
shorter one nearer the wrist than the longer one.
They looked blackish brown from the clear side, but
from the ground side they looked silvery in appearance,
but there was no appearance of any layer of fat,
it
was
simply a furry appearance, and the brown did not show
through. Next day, most of this white silvery sheen
had gone, and the brown showed from the ground side.
(82) Fourth experiment—Mrs. Deane held two folded
papers, making four leaves, of prussiate paper between
her hands, with the usual precautions taken by me.
I
had replaced the head-band, and
I
suggested, vigor
ously, during ten minutes, that
a
leg should appear, or
a
ring. The result on the prussiate paper was
a
brown
Fis- 236 mark on an inside page and
a
brown mark on the
outside page
;
nothing more on the head-band.
(82a) During all these experiments,
a
large piece of cartridge paper was hanging
up from the shelf, and
I
had put
a
piece of paper during each experiment under
Mrs. Deane's boots. The paper from the boots
I
removed every time;
I
left
the pendant paper in situ in the room. Nothing came on the hanging paper,
but there were two indeﬁnite brown marks on the foot paper, beyond the boots.
(83) CommenL—With reference to the ring mark obtained today, in order to
see whether
it
was easy to make
a
similar impression “ith any ring worn by
Mrs. Deane, and to obtain
a
circle from
it
for comparison of measurement,
I
borrowed one of her two rings, which, as
I
have previously remarked,
came over her knuckle with difﬁculty, and, having spread some ink from my
fountain pen on
a
piece of cardboard,
I
pressed the ring into it, and tried to make
an impression. This, of course, in the daylight, and at my ease, whereas on the
occasion mentioned, Mrs. Deane's hands were enclosed in
a
cardboard tube, and
I
was watching. My ﬁrst attempts to produce
a
clear circular mark were not
successful. After several attempts,
I
did obtain
a
circle, but
it
was not as
HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (84) (85) Fig. 237 Page 141
neat and clear as Mrs. Deane's. It must be remembered that I had a ﬂat
surface to press upon, whereas the inside of the tube round Mrs. Deane's hands
was corrugated. It is conclusive, therefore, that Mrs. Deane did not herself
put the circular mark upon the paper; only after her hands were imprisoned
did she become aware of my intention to ask for such a mark. From the entry
to the withdrawal of her hands from the tube I was on guard, watching.
February 24th, 1925.—Wcather cold.
electric stove on.
(84) First experiment—Four pieces of cartridge paper, folded separately,
numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4, making sixteen pages, No. 1 being the top page, placed
in a large envelope 9l-in. X 6l-in. The paper measured a little less in length than
the envelope. The folds were at the closed end of the envelope. The ﬂap of
the envelope was tucked inside over the cartridge paper. The envelope was
given to Mrs. Deane with the open end towards me. I was very careful with
control, not putting anything into position until I was ready to shut the door
of the dark-room. Before giving Mrs. Deane the paper to hold between her
hands I had put a head-band on her head, and had hung up a piece of cartridge
paper as usual and put a large piece of prussiate paper as usual under her booted
feet, extending well under the chair.
At the end of each experiment, I removed each article before Mrs. Deane
stirred from her seat, or moved her hands away from her lap. For the ﬁrst
experiment we sat for forty minutes, chatting.
Mrs. Deane in good humour;
I suggested to-day a perfect
ring or circle, 2-in. in diameter,
also a leg or a capital
“
L."
The result of the ﬁrst experi
ment was a blackish brown kind
of
“
S
"
on the lowest page
beginning at lﬁ-in. from the top
edge.
There were some greyish
greenish yellow marks on the
head-band outside over the fore
head, among them two small
rings and an
"
L” reversed
Fis- 237 (Fig. 237).
Nothing on the hanging paper ; nothing on the foot paper.
(85) Second experiment—I replaced the hanging-paper, the head-paper and
the foot-paper. I gave Mrs. Deane twelve pieces of wax paper pinned together at
one corner to hold. We got deﬁnite cracks; these cracks spelt out "James
Coates
"
by the alphabet. There were no marks on the wax paper.
Third ex1>eriment—I put the head-band in position, the hanging-paper and
the foot-paper. I then gave Mrs. Deane two half-plate focussing screens to
hold, rough side outwards, and put over her hands a cardboard square tube,
narrower than the last, viz.: ﬁl-in. wide, ll-in. long, and 21,4n. high (the previous
one measured 8-in. X ll-in. XiZl-in. high). I suggested a ring or circle, or a leg.
The result was, on one of the plates, a broad faint streak, about ll-in. Xl-in.,
and a hook, something like an
“
l
"
reversed, on the top side.
Fourth experimenL—A piece of prussiate paper folded in two ; usual inspection
and wiping of hands. Mrs. Deane held the paper between her hands for ten
minutes, while I suggested a ring. The result was a mark like a small "all"
on the left hand paper; nothing on the right.
Nothing appeared on the head-band, hanging-paper, or foot-paper.
Page 142 Figs. 238, 239 Pars. (86) to (87¢) H 8: F EXPERIMENTS.
March 3rd, 1925,—.\Irs. Deane in good form. Room warm.
Second experiment—Paper hanging up; paper under feet; a paper-band
round head ; wax paper to hold. I drew the curtain partially over the window.
A few cracks and noises in connection with the wax paper, but no result visible.
(86) Third experiment—I-Ianging-paper, foot-paper, head-paper as before.
Head-paper and foot-paper always removed by me at end of each experiment.
Hanging-paper always examined by me
before each experiment, back and front.
Two half-plate focussing screens placed,
clear sides together. I put these in
13
Mrs. Deane's hands and wrapped her
"'
hands round with a black cloth. We
sat together for about ﬁfteen minutes.
I then took the glasses from her,
removing the cloth myself, of course.
The result was a large oval mark, about
2-in.Xl}-in. in two colours, pink and
brown, suggesting a potato, 0n the
lower plate (Fig. 238X119. The mark
shows best from the clear side. One
cannot see any substance on the rough
side.
(864) Comment—Impossible for Mrs.
Deane to have put this large mark on the
plain frosted glass under the conditions.
I always examined her hands before each
experiment. Her hands were wrapped
round tightly by my black cloth.
Impossible for her to obtain possession of
any colouring material. The original
must be seen to allow of the appreciation
Fig 138 X r5 linear of the varied colouring.
(87) Fourth experiment—I gave
Mrs. Deane two folded pieces of
prussiate paper, one inside the
other, the fold was as an exception
on her right side, and not at
her wrist this time. I examined the
hanging-paper. The smudges were
as before. I suggested during the
whole of this sitting, which lasted
ten minutes, a foot, an
“
L," or
a ring or circle. The result was a
large
“
L" on the upper surface,
under Mrs. Deane's right hand
(Fig. 241F, page 143), and a thick
large mark, like an "S "
(Fig. 239),
on one of the inner pages, and a
large
"
L
"
on the back of the
hanging-paper (Fig. 241G, page
143). All these marks were brown.
, (87a) Comment—I must indeed
F'g- 13o) have been blind if Mrs. Deane had
put these two large marks (all illustrations are natural size, unless it is stated
otherwise) without my observing her do it.

March 10th, 1925,—A very bright day, but cold; electric stove on, and
hot water ready for some carbon-process experiments, of which I had advised
Mrs. Deane the night before, so that her guides
(if
there are such) might prepare
things. Mrs. Deane in good form, very amiable.
I
used six carbon tissues
obtained from the Autotype Company, half-plate size, ivory black. As
a
foundation for these,
I
used clear glass with prepared surface supplied by the
Autotype Co.
I
took every precaution experience could teach me; my own
clean duster as
a
towel, inspected Mrs. Deane's hands and stood over her during
each experiment.
(8
71;)
F
irst experimenL—A pair of carbon tissues were placed side by side, pinned
down with drawing pins on
a
board provided with
a l-in. high ledge, on which Mrs. Deane rested her
wrists, so that her hands were just above the
sheets. She kept her hands over the paper, or
tissue, for ﬁfteen minutes.
I
then0developed the
tissues. Both pieces had large marks, chieﬂy of
a
brownish colour. One of them, the right hand
one, had a large "5” on
it
(Fig. 242) and more
marks than the left. Mrs. Deane, during this sitting,
had said how her right arm ached.
I
suggested
during the three experiments of to-day that
I
should get a circle. In parts the gelatine was
thickly affected, so much so, that the "5” showed
through as a white depression on the white backing,
when
I
squeegeed away the soluble gelatine.
(8

¢)
Second experiment—Mrs. Deane held the two Fig. 242
carbon tissues put back to back between her
hands, placing her hands ﬂat upon the black sensitive sides. Both sheets were
deeply affected. There was
a
broad circle on one, seen on development.
I
was suggesting
a
circle.
Third experimenL—This was conducted in the same way as the second.
The left hand sheet was deeply affected. The right hand one was
a
blank. As
I
say, all the marks were largely brown in colour.
Mrs. Deane seems to know nothing about the carbon process, and was as
interested as myself in the results.
I
might add, that
I
opened the packet as
received from the Autotype Co. in the dark-room just before the ﬁrst experiment
and gave Mrs. Deane no opportunity to0handle any of the tissues between the
experiments. Next day,
I
took the results to the Manager of the Autotype
Co. He was interested, and examined them with
a
lens. He stated, that with
a very large experience of bichromated gelatine, he considered that the plates
I
submitted had every appearance of gelatine rendered insoluble. He could
not account for the brown colour of the gelatine on the Deane products.
March 12th, 1925,—Fine bright day. Mrs. Deane in good form. Electric
stove on. We sat chatting till ﬁve minutes to eleven.
To-day
I
kept suggesting
a
circle or
a
ring should come.
During each experiment to-day,
a
large piece of cartridge paper was hanging
up near Mrs. Deane. This was not removed after each experiment, but examined
before and after each experiment.
I
was particularly careful to give Mrs. Deane
no opportunity to touch anything before
I
examined or removed it. The foot-
paper was removed after each experiment while Mrs. Deane's hands were still on
her lap.
(88) First experiment—Two folded pieces of cartridge paper, making four
leaves, held between Mrs. Deane's hands placed in the cardboard tube as before;

ﬁfteen minutes. Result of ﬁrst experiment: A slight smudge on an interior
page, and a corresponding, but smaller smudge on the page facing it, the second
evidently an impression from the ﬁrst.
Second experimenL—Twelve pieces of wax paper held between Mrs. Deane's
hands placed in the cardboard tube. No crackling, no marks.
(89) Third experimenL—Two focussing screens, half-plate size, ground sur
face outwards. Mrs. Deane's hands wTped and examined before this experiment.
Hands and glasses in the cardboard tube. It measured 6l-in. wide, 2§-in.
high, ll-in. long ; it is corrugated inside ; ﬁfteen minutes holding. Mrs. Deane
withdrew her hands from the tube. I took possession of the glasses before she
had removed her hands, so that she had no opportunity to do anything to
them. On examining the glasses, I found on the ground surface of each a large
white impression of a material
which had the appearance of soap.
Both these marks turned deepish
brown ; each of two shades of brown.
Both marks are similar in character,
one is a large broad
“
S," a double
“S." the other is a very peculiar
mark, which Mrs. Deane could hardly
have done with her ﬁnger (Fig. 243).
Under the conditions she could not
have put anything on the plates
unobserved, certainly not this pecu
liar mark.
During this and the next
experiment, she had a head-band
on.
(90) Fourth experimenL—I gave
Mrs.Deane the folded cartridge papers
used in the ﬁrst experiment to hold
again between her hands, this time
without the tube. I stood opposite
her, as during all other experiments,
carefully watching. There were
peculiar single dull sounds from the
paper like dull taps. The result of _. - s-~»~ -*
this experiment was a very light
pinkish brown "S" about Ii-in. [203 Z 5 R
long, the stroke %-in. thick. It turned
nearly black. This was on an outside __-_-'—3--- -—-
page. On an inside page was a brown
' ‘
smudge.
Nothing came on the hanging
paper, nor on the wax papers. On
the foot-paper were two small marks which turned dark-brown.
Fig. 243
March 17th, 1925,—Mrs. Deane in good form and weather bright and not
very cold.
I damped a piece of cartridge paper at my ofﬁce with a solution of citrate
of iron and ammonia, both sides. I damped another piece with ferricyanide of
potash. They each measured 16-in.X5-in. When dry I folded them in half,
and put the ferricyanide paper inside the other, folds together. I took care
to supervise very thoroughly.
Page 146 Fig. 244 Pars. (90a) (90b) (91) H a r EXPERIMENTS.
I had with me to-day, and at every future sitting in the dark-room, an
electric pocket lamp, the lens covered with red paper. I told Mrs. Deane I
should ﬂash this at any moment I liked. She raised no objection whatever.
I desired to have the dark-room somewhat darker. On this account I had the
lamp and also because on dark mornings I could not see distinctly enough ;
but my sense of hearing is very acute, and my hands are always free to explore.
It is only on dark mornings that I cannot discern clearly Mrs. Deane's hands
and lap, and she does not know this.
I was suggesting this morning at each experiment a perfect circle or a
large ring like a boy's hoop, or a cart-wheel, or a curtain ring, large and thick.
In this and all to-day's experiments Mrs. Deane's hands were covered and
imprisoned by a tube of corrugated cardboard measuring 6l-in. wide, ll-in.
long, and 2l-in. high.
First experiment—Mrs. Deane held these papers, one inside the other as
described, for ﬁfteen minutes. She had a head-paper on her head. There was
a piece of plain cartridge paper hanging up behind her, and a piece under her
feet. The hanging-paper I left all the time ; the other papers I removed after
each experiment. No result from the ﬁrst experiment.
Second experiment—I gave Mrs. Deane the ferricyanide paper to hold by
itself, hoping that some of the citrate of iron might have been absorbed into the
hands and be deposited on the ferricyanide. I damped the inside of the
ferricyanide paper very slightly with plain water with a sponge. Before each
experiment I examined her hands and wiped them with a clean duster
I had brought with me. Mrs. Deane held the ferricyanide paper for ﬁfteen
minutes. She had the paper on her head and under her feet as before. Result :
a roundish blot l-in. in diameter, a circle or ring with blank centre just showing
of a slatey-black colour, with a little pink on one edge, appeared on the upper
surface, under the palm of the right hand. It turned browny-black. Nothing
on the other papers (seep. 119, Fig. 199).
(904) Fourth experiment—Two pieces of clean
focussing screen, half-plate size, back to back, rough
surfaces outside held between Mrs. Deane's hands
for ﬁfteen minutes while her hands were imprisoned
in the cardboard tube as before. I hoped to get
some red wax from the previous experiment on to
the glass. This did not happen. I took the plates
from Mrs. Deane through the open end of the
tube nearest me and found on the upper plate a
large "S" of a waxy appearance (Fig. 244 X
linear). The mark on the plate turned light brown.
In Fig. 244 there are two accidental marks which
I have encircled with a line.
(90b) C0mment—In Fig. 244 will be seen a broad
line going from the edge of the plate towards the
large "S" ; this would appear to indicate the path
taken by the substance used, whatever it may be.
The marks were certainly not put on by Mrs. Deane.
Such a line of approach is to be seen in some
other marks.
(91) Fiﬂh experiment—I gave Mrs. Deane the
papers to hold exactly as she held them in the’
ﬁrst experiment. The inner paper, of course, had
the mark upon it put on in the second experiment.
During the whole time of this experiment, lasting
ﬁfteen minutes, I stood close to her and kept
HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS. Par. (92) Fig. 245 Page 147
repeating :
"
Mrs. Deane will put a ring on the paper, many rings all over the
paper, a large circle, a large circle with a circumference an inch wide." Before
I started this experiment, I examined the hanging-paper and found two small
rings upon the front of it (Fig. A, see below) ; they had come on in the interlude.

On the upper surface of
the papers held between
the hands imprisoned in
the tube appeared ﬁve
rings (Fig. 2458) and two
circles appeared on the
upper surface of an inner
page (Fig. 245C). The
papers were not creased,
and as I had examined and wiped Mrs. Deane's hands with my duster before
the experiment, there was no possibility of her having made these circular
marks. The inner surface of the tube was corrugated.
There was a smaller circle on the head-band of a very light colour, smaller
than the others, and of a somewhat greasy appearance. Mrs. Deane had.
herself, put the head-hand on, so this mark is not evidential.
During this sitting Mrs. Deane said that some invisible operator was tickling
her nose. She also stated that her feet were trembling, as they do in a motor
car. I had covered her lap and feet with my black cloth, which reached down to
the ground all round.
Fig. 245
(92) March 19th, 1925,—Bright day. Mrs. Deane amiable.
Every care was taken by me at the sitting; I examined her hands,
and wiped them with my own duster. I put in the dark-room one saucer on the
ﬂoor, near Mrs. Deane's left foot, and one on the lower of the two shelves.
Into these I poured a watery solution of aniline walnut stain. Near the
second saucer on the shelf I put a wooden printing block, about l-in. cube.
engraved to print an "M" l-in. high, the idea being to give the invisible
operator something to work with. I had my electric torch with me giving a
good red light by simply turning the torch over from one side to the other,
so that no warning was given when the extra light was about to be applied,
and I made use of it frequently, especially when I heard the least movement.
I put the band round Mrs. Deane's head, and Mrs. Deane never touched it; in
fact, she only touched it during these and all the previous experiments on the
one occasion noted in my last report (of the 17th inst, when she put it on
Page 148 Pars. (92a) to (94) HANDS 8: FEET EXPERIMENTS.
herself). I hung a piece of paper up as before. I put paper under the feet and
chair. I covered Mrs. Deane's lap and legs with my black focussing cloth,
brought with me. I used my clean duster, brought with me, to wipe her hands.
I put the head-band on. After each experiment I removed the head-band and
the foot-paper, but I left the hanging-paper, which I examined carefully before
and after each experiment. Mrs. Deane suffered much pain from irritation of the
breast, and thought I should get nothing on that account. I suggested an
"
M
"
during the whole of this sitting, though we chatted about other things.
First experimenL—Two pieces of plain cartridge paper folded together as
before, held between Mrs. Deane's hands. I had no cardboard tube to-day over
them, not having brought it with me. No results at all anywhere.
Second experimenL—The red wax paper as used on the last occasion held
between Mrs. Deane's hands; ﬁfteen minutes; no result anywhere.
(92a) Third experimenL—Two half-plate focussing screens, ground surfaces out
wards, held between Mrs. Deane's hands. Before this experiment, Mrs. Deane
called my attention to a brown stain on the inner side of the tip of her left hand
fore-ﬁnger, near the adjacent ﬁnger, and a slight stain on the tip of the adjacent
ﬁnger where it touches the fore-ﬁnger. She could not account for this, and was
surprised at it, as she had touched nothing. She dipped her hands in water and
wiped the hands with my duster, and got as much off as possible. After this
thorough cleaning, she held the glasses between her hands. I suggested the
“
M
"
as before. The result was two broad
"
M's
"
on the upper glass, one quite
near the wrist (Fig. 246A). They had the same whitish soapy sheen as on the
two last occasions. The last
"
M
"
stroke of the upper "M "
had a brownish
tinge at the side. This part turned dark brown ; the remainder turned light
brown. No result on the papers. Duration of experiment ﬁfteen minutes.
(92b) Fourth experiment—I gave Mrs. Deane the cartridge papers ﬁrst used to-day,
and I spent the whole ﬁfteen minutes of this experiment in repeating“ Mrs. Deane
will put an
'
M' on the papers." I took care to speak in such a way as to make
Mrs. Deane laugh twice. The result was, as regards the paper held between
the hands, nil. There were two marks upon the head-band (this Mrs. Deane
had not touched at all, I can swear). One part consists of the ﬁrst three strokes
of a capital
"
M” (the printing block which I had shown Mrs. Deane bore a
capital
“
M "). The strokes were about a }-in. wide and l-in. long. Now the
second mark was the remainder of the
“
M." It was about }-in. away from the
other mark, and would have formed the remainder of the
"
M
”
had it been
placed correctly (Fig. B.) (For Figure see p. 149).
(93) Comment.—It looks as if the fourth limb of the
“
M
"
(Fig. B) had broken
away, or as if the "operator” who wrote the ﬁrst part of the "M" ran short of
material, and in putting the last portion of the “M” could not see the ’ﬁrst
portion, or aimed badly. In the lowest picture I have put the fourth limb as
I conceive it should be. (Fig. 246C, p. 149.)
None of the
“
M's
"
were like the
“
M
"
on the printing block.
(94) Mm-ch 24th, 1925,—I devoted this sitting to six carbon tissues,
white. I sensitised the sheets with spirit sensitiser in the dark-room in
Mrs. Deane's absence. The sheets were, I think, not quite dry enough when
used. I pinned two sheets side by side, on the board which has the ledge for the
wrists. Mrs. Deane held her hands over the papers for ﬁfteen minutes.
keeping her hands a distance of iL-in. away from the papers. I removed the
sheets one at a time, and examined the surfaces before putting them in water.
Each surface had a brown mark upon it of no deﬁnite design. On developing
these two tissues in the usual manner, supporting them on prepared half-plate
glasses supplied by The Autotype Co.. the brown marks remained, together with
some of the white gelatine rendered insoluble by some means or other.
The other four pieces of tissues were treated in pairs for ﬁfteen minutes

between Mrs. Deane's hands. One of these four alone was much affected.
The outcome was that some large portions of insoluble white gelatine remained
on the glass.
I had been suggesting an
“
M
"
all this morning.
Mrs. Deane wore a head-band and I hung a piece of paper from the shelf.
Nothing came on these.
March 26th, 1925,—Weather bright. I drew the curtain across the window
to have the dark-room darker, using my red electric torch for "controlling"
purposes. I used it frequently. I relied also on my acute sense of hearing.
To-day I suggested a
"
D." Paper hanging up, paper under feet, head
band on during each experiment. I always withdraw head-band and foot
paper immediately after each experiment. Mrs. Deane did not touch them.
The hanging-paper I left hanging all the time, but I examined it carefully before
and after each experiment. Mrs. Deane washed her hands immediately before
the sitting. I examined them and wiped them with a clean duster I had brought
with me, before each experiment. During the sittings to-day Mrs. Deane stated
she saw many little lights.
First experimenL—Three folded sheets of cartridge paper in large closed
envelope, with corners cut off, held between Mrs. Deane's hands for ﬁfteen
minutes.
Result of ﬁrst experiment between hands, nothing.
(95) I started a new experiment to-day, without warning. I gave Mrs. Deane
a piece of cartridge paper, about 10-in. wide and 7-in. high, which I got her to
place next to her skin on her breast. I call this a breast-paper. This was
k '*-_—0 "a.

withdrawn on each occasion and replaced. The result on this paper was a light,
yellowish-brown circle, about ll-in. in diameter, with short lines cutting the
circumference more or less all round the circle. Later it became darker (Fig.247).
(95a) CommenL—This seems to me to be an excellently evidential result. Quite
impossible for Mrs. Deane to have put this design on the paper without my
knowledge. The experiment was a surprise one. Mrs. Deane had no inkling
that I was going to ask her to insert the paper. Neither she nor I could
suggest any meaning to the design. Lately it has reminded me of a cogged
wheel with
“
V
"
shaped cogs. Now, when I ﬁrst saw
“
V
"
shaped cogs, known
as herring-bone or double-helical cogs (Fig. 248) in a French machine,
I was very much struck with the idea; it was so strange and novel to me. I had
gone to Paris to buy a machine. I have evidence in these experiments with Mrs.
H & F EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (96) (96a), Fig. 249 Page 151
Deane. that things which have made a strong impression on my memory plates,
attract the attention of the unseen operator (see the ring results on pages 183,
220). This cogged wheel is certainly not an important thing in my life, but the
particular page in the book of my memory, containing this strong impression,
may have happened to become exposed*. This circle was on the side of the
paper away from the breast.
(96) Second experimenL—Twelve pieces of wax paper, 8-in. X 5-in., pinned
together at the corner, held between hands imprisoned in the narrow cardboard
tube. No crackling; ﬁfteen minutes. I suggested a
“
D." Mrs. Deane
withdrew her hands from the tube while I
held the wax paper from the other end of the
tube The effect of the pressure and warmth
of Mrs. Deane's hands was to cause the major
part of the wax paper to cohere into a block.
On separating the leaves I found on the lower
surface of the ﬁfth inside sheet from the
bottom, a very faint, but distinct, large
“
S,"
2-in. X hj-in. This mark became slightly
darker before I left. It is to be remembered
her hands were within the cardboard tube.
(964) Third experiment—I gave Mrs. Deane
two half-plate focussing screens, the ground
surface outside, to hold between her hands
in the tube for a quarter of an hour. Result :
A very faint large mark on one plate, and
fainter markings on the other. The marks
darkened later and showed two
"
D's ‘" on Fig. 249
one plate (Fig. 249).
Fourth experimenL—Repetition of ﬁrst experiment. During this experiment
I kept suggesting the letter
"
D
"
the whole time. No result.
March 313t, 1925,—Weather warmish, fairly bright. The medium in good
humour. She made her hands dirty by groping on the ﬂoor with them for an
electric ﬁtting I dropped ; she went downstairs and washed them. I took all
my usual precautions to-day, not allowing Mrs. Deane to touch anything, such as
paper on head and under feet. I removed these after each sitting. The
hanging-paper remained up, but I examined it carefully before and after each
experiment as I did Mrs. Deane's hands, wiping them with a clean duster I had
brought with me. I had my red torch, which I put on by just turning it over
without any warning noise, frequently. Mrs. Deane was particularly quiet
to-day.
First experiment, as also fourth experiment, was with the closed envelope
used on the last occasion, with three folded sheets of cartridge paper (six pages),
ﬁfteen minutes each, held between Mrs. Deane's hands. I suggested a "D"
during the whole of the sitting to-day ; no result. During the ﬁrst experiment,
a piece of ferroprussiate paper was under her feet (an old piece). A mark
2-in. long, like a
“
7
"
reversed, came on at the left of the right boot, outside
it near the toes.
* With reference to a message received by automatic writing containing the words ""
Some
Sweet Day," Mr Charles Hall Cook in his book Psychic Photography, states be well
remembered the incident when the song
'
Some Sweet Day" was connected with himself.
The author added this was one of the trivial incidents that are hidden away in some niche
of memory, and, conditions being suitable, are resuscitated with remarkable vividness and
accuracy. (See Appendix) (336) p. 315.

and
a broad mark came on the lower
glass, viz.: the ground surface
touching the left hand (Fig. 250).
Mrs. Deane had no chance to do
this herself. The marks were
white, as lately all have been, and
darkened later. [Is the upper
mark an edge-on view of the
lower one ?]
(96¢) The ferroprussiate
paper under the feet had
a pair of marks, much
alike, part brown, part
pink, on the ball of the
big toe of the left foot
(Fig. 251) of the usual
colour so characteristic of
Mrs. Deane's foot-paper
marks. No deﬁnite
design, but the similarity
not been within the distance of her knees from her
feet. I examined the sole of her boot and wiped it with
a piece of paper. There was no evidence of anything
but dirt. When I put the paper under Mrs. Deane's
feet, she already had the glasses in her hands, and I
took the paper away from her feet simultaneously
with removing the glasses from her hands. I did not
use the tube or tunnel to-day. Each experiment
lasted ﬁfteen minutes.
Fourth experiment—Same as ﬁrst. Result : nil.
A slight streak, brownish, came on the hanging
paper.

H & F EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (98) (99) Fig. 253 Page 153
(98) There appeared a mark on each focussing plate of a different character to
most ; being composed of a mass of ﬁne lines resembling the texture of Fig. 243,
page 145.
April 7th, 1925.—A very dull, foggy morning.
I had my red torch with me, which I used frequently, and which is a perfect
control. I put paper under her feet, extending under the chair, a paper round the
head, a paper hanging up, and she put a paper on her breast, under her clothes.
The ﬁrst two I removed every time after each experiment. The last two I left
in situ. I took care to observe closely; Mrs. Deane could not have done
anything to the breast-paper. It measures 10-in. X 8-in., and was inserted with
difﬁculty. The hanging-paper I examined before and after each experiment.
Third experiment—Fifteen minutes. Two new glass focussing screens, half
plate size, held between Mrs. Deane's hands, rough side outwards, in the
cardboard tube. I held the glasses from the open ends near me while Mrs. Deane
withdrew her hands from the tube. Result : Some indeﬁnite whitish marks on
both plates.
(99) Fourth experiment—I re
peated the third experiment in
order to try to obtain a com
pletion of the ﬁrst marks, result
ing in something more deﬁnite. I
suggested a
“
D
"
vigorously
during this last experiment.
Result : A new mark on the top
of the plate*; and a "D "
made
of a broad stroke about %-in. in
thickness, 1%-in. high (Fig. 253).
These marks became dark. It
will be seen that there is a spike
at one corner of the "D," as if
to prove that the "D" could
not have been drawn with a
ﬁnger; as indeed was quite
impossible under the conditions.
On examination, the ﬁrst mark,
the lowest, on this plate might
also, at a stretch, be regarded
as a capital "D." I had
suggested a capital, not a small
"d." I saw Mrs. Deane wipe
her hands with my duster every
time just before each experiment.
As regards the paper under
the feet and chair, there were
some marks near the toes of
the left foot, which turned darker
brown later on.
Fig, 253 As regards the hanging-paper
there was a slight yellowish
brown indeﬁnite streak, which turned darker. Nothing on the head-paper.
I found nothing on the breast-paper on this day, nor on the 8th April at my
ofﬁce, but on the 9th April, at my ofﬁce, Ifound two brown marks similar in
colour to the usual marks, had put in an appearance. (Through oxidation

Page 156 Figs. 257, 258 Pars. (102d) to (102!) H & l“ EXPTS.
On account of the dog's bite Mrs. Deane's arm was in a sling, so she could
not make much use of her left hand. It hurt her to move her ﬁngers.
During each experiment to-day I put a head-band on Mrs. Deane's head,
and a piece of paper under her feet, withdrawing them after each experiment.
To-day I kept on suggesting a triangle.
(102d) Third experiment—Two new pieces of focussing glass screen between
Mrs. Deane's hands. During this experiment, as during the others, I shone
my torch on Mrs. Deane's hands. On one
occasion I got the impression of Mrs. Deane's
right hand being 6-in. above the plate, but
immediately I saw it, or rather, instantaneously
afterwards, casting my eyes lower, I saw her
hand on the plate. Now, there was no move
ment of the hand; I should have seen that.
I asked Mrs. Deane whether she had moved
her hand. She said, quite calmly, she had not
moved her hand. Later on she remarked what
I had said about seeing a phantom hand was
interesting. Had I perhaps seen something
which does the things? The result of this
experiment was : On the top plate an unﬁnished
triangle, 2-in. long (Fig. 257). On the lower plate
there were some large, curved marks. Now,
certainly, Mrs. Deane could have done nothing
on the lower plate on account of the injury to Fig. 257
her left hand. This applies also to (1021; and c).
Before each experiment Mrs. Deane wiped her hands, in my presence, on a
clean duster I had brought with me.
April 28th, 1925,—A poor day. Mrs. Deane complained of feeling unwell.
My suggestion to-day was a triangle. Two hanging-papers, one foot-paper,
a head-paper, a breast-paper. All in situ as usual. Usual precautions.
Second cxperiment—Vl’ax paper as before. Result,
nil.
(1023) Third experimenL—Two focussing screens
between Mrs. Deane's hands, covered with the card
board tube as usual. Result, two large marks on one
of the glasses. One of the marks triangular in shape.
The glass with marks had rested on Mrs. Deane's
left hand. I thereupon pressed the other glass on
Mrs. Deane's left hand. No mark was made on the
glass.
On the breast-paper I found a light-brown mark
like an "S” (Fig. 258). This turned in time to two
shades of brown, one very dark. Fig. 258
April 30th, 1925.—A bright day. Mrs. Deane complained of want of sleep
for several days, and a headache, but in outward manner she seemed all right.
She was very patient, but seemed a bit bored with the experiments.
I gave her no intimation of what I proposed to do to-day. I had my
electric torch, which I used freely, for I had darkened the dark-room a good
deal. I had the usual hanging-papers, which remained in situ the whole time,
as did a breast-paper, a head-paper and a foot-paper; the two latter were
removed each time. Mrs. Deane sat on her stool as usual. I stood opposite to
her. I put my black cloth over her lap, it extended to the ﬂoor. She never
touched the foot-paper. She had her boots and stockings on.
(102f) During the last experiment to-day some marks came upon the foot-paper;
H 8: F EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (103) (104) Figs. 259 to 261 Page 157
one a pinkish yellowish-brown
mark, 4l<;-in. long (Fig. 260

appears to have got broken
or twisted during the process
of application.
I
have un
twisted
it
(F

to me that
it
was originally
an
“
S," as so many "S's”
appear on the materials sub
jected by me to Mrs. Deane's
inﬂuence. Compare Fig. 260
with the large
"
S's" which
appeared to-day on the Auto
type tissues (Figs. 262
A
and
B
Other marks also appeared
on the foot.papers. One

not visible this day (30th).
It
was seen at my ofﬁce the Fig- 259 Fis- 26°
next day. There was
a
mark on the breast-paper, not the skin side.
(103) Second experiment—The evening before, at
home,
I
had sensitised six pieces of Autotype cameo
white pigmented tissue.
I
did this by the light of
a
red
lamp.
I
kept them in
a
box when dry, and wrapped the
box in two pieces of paper. After the ﬁrst experiment
I
told Mrs. Deane
l
was about to experiment again with
pigmented tissue, which
I
should take away with me
and develop at my oﬁ‘ice.
I
pinned two of these half
plate size pieces, sensitised side upwards, side by side,
on the board with ledges, as previously described.
Mrs. Deane held her hands over these pieces, without
touching them, for ﬁfteen minutes. On removing her
hands
I
found on each sensitised sheet
a
huge
“
S," Fig- 261
brown in colour, with
a
curve as
if
it
were bent over,
like
a
solid square bar would be bent, one surface of which was darker than the
adjacent one, of such
a
character that they could not have been done with
a
ﬁnger
(Fig. 262
A
and B).
I
used my torch frequently during these Autotype experi
ments, and
I
can honestly assert that Mrs. Deane did not move her ﬁngers or hands,
for
I
used my torch when
I
thought ﬁt, without notice, and caused the light to
shine by simply turning the torch over in my hand, so that the battery fell in
the case and made the connections without any warning sound or any diﬁ‘iculty.
This description applies to the three experiments
I
made with tissue sheets.
I
removed the ﬁrst tissue sheets and put them into the box. They were not wet.
(104) Third experimenL—I took two other pigmented tissues which were
treated exactly as the ﬁrst two. After ﬁfteen minutes the result was
:
On the one
sheet two broad lines from corner to corner, crossing one another, brownish in
colour; on the other sheet an
"
S
"
similar to the ﬁrst two, but much smaller
(Figs. 262
C
and D). For ﬁgures see next page.
Page 158 Fig. 262 HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS.
Fig. 262
Fourth experimenL—Two more tissue sheets for ﬁfteen minutes. On this
occasion Mrs. Deane put her hands ﬂat upon the tissue. Result, nil.
During all to-day's experiments I suggested a triangle chieﬂy. I also
suggested a perfect circle, the head of the late dog
"
Bruce." or any nice picture.
My suggestions were evidently ignored.
On developing the tissues at my ofﬁce the last two left blank glasses.
I used Autotype transparent glass supports. The other four left the brown
marks upon the glass supports, together with fair margins of the white pigmented
gelatine, which had evidently become insoluble. Mrs. Deane certainly has no
knowledge of chemistry and did not know I was going to bring Autotype tissues
to-day. I have to note that on developing the ﬁrst large "S" I noticed that
some of the brown colour ran as if dissolved. It had a reddish-brown tinge.
This did not happen with the second large
" S," nor with the other two marks.
H & F EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (1040) (105) Figs. 263, 264 Page 159
Under the conditions it was impossible for Mrs. Deane to have used any material.
I examined her hands and wiped them with my duster before each experiment,
and examined her hands afterwards, and her ﬁngers had no stains nor any
moisture. I tried my own hands on the last two tissues, which were blank,
with no effect.
(104a) Commenf.—It seems out of the question that Mrs. Deane could have
produced these large marks, requiring so much material, by fraud, under the
conditions reported above.
May 5th, 1925,—I took with me to-day, as a surprise to Mrs. Deane, the
structure which I call
"
hand-stocks." and which is described and illustrated
on page 107. Mrs. Deane complained of not having slept at all last night.
Experiments with Mrs. Deane's hands imprisoned in the hand-stocks—
each ﬁfteen minutes. I suggested a triangle to-day or any good picture.
First experimenL—Two pieces of cartridge paper, side by side, on the
horizontal board, and one piece on the easel. Result: On the left piece of
horizontal paper, a light yellowish mark, which turned dark brown.
Second experiment—Two pieces of Autotype tissue under hands. Result:
Marks 2-in. X ll-in. dark brown under centre of right hand.
Third experiment—Two pieces of ground glass under hands. Result :
one of the glasses a large circular patch appeared under the centre of one hand,
very light in colour.
On the easel paper were two brown strokes g-in. wide, %-in. and li-in. long—
evidently produced by a liquid as one had a blob at the lower end of it darker
in colour than the rest ; yet they were dry.
May 7th, 1925,—A fairly bright day. Mrs. Deane cheerful. but complained
of want of sleep the night before.
In all the three experiments today I used the instrument imprisoning the
hands (the hand-stocks) and had my electric torch in action now and again.
During all experiments there was no rustling or other noise.
To-day I suggested, during each experiment, a triangle should appear.
(1041;) First experimenL—Piece of cartridge paper on easel, two pieces of paper
under the hands. We sang
" Abide with me
”
during each
experiment. Sole result of ﬁrst experiment, a mark which,
at a great stretch, might be called a circular triangle,
I-in. X i-in., appeared on the paper under the right hand,
of light pinkish-yellow, which turned dark brown. The
papers under the hands were double pieces. The mark
| '_
—l- :— l—R- was on the top outside.
'
(1 05) SecondexpcrimenL—
I placed a piece of cartridge
paper on the easel, and a
board, which I had brought
with me, with two pieces Fig-263
of Autotype cameo tissue, which I had sensitised
overnight, ﬁxed thereon, under her hands. I
suggested, vigorously, a big, thick triangle with
broad lines. The result was a triangular mark
on the paper on the easel (Fig. 263), and under
the right hand, a dark brown, thick-sided triangle
(Fig. 264). On the left tissue was a large reversed
"
S," brown in colour, not so solid as the triangle
(see Fig. 265, page 160). The articles are always
inserted under Mrs. Deane's hands and on the
Fig-164 easel after Mrs. Deane's hands are imprisoned,
and removed before her hands are freed.
Page 160 Figs. 265, 266 Pars. (1050) (106) H 8: F EXPERIMENTS.
Third experiment—A piece of paper on the easel, two focussing glasses under
the hands, rough side up.
(1054) Result of third experiment, a large,
reversed “5" on the easel paper (Fig. 266).
As usual I took everything away with me.
I developed the two tissues of the second
experiment at my ofﬁce, and succeeded in
transferring the gelatine to prepared trans
parent glass supports, which I had bought from
the Autotype Co. The result on the supports
was, after thoroughly splashing them with
water at 100 deg. Fahr., according to Autotype
directions, that the brown marks remained
upon the glass, together with the insoluble
gelatine impregnated with the white colouring
matter originally in the tissue, covering and
adumbrating the triangle and the
"
S." This
experiment is beyond all cavil. Before we
started experiments this morning, Mrs. Deane
and I collected together the many smoked
cardboards which were in the room for
removal to my ofﬁce. The result was that
Mrs. Deane's hands were very black and she
had to wash them thoroughly before we
started our experiment. I did not fail, how
ever, to examine them and wipe them with
my duster before each experiment.
(106) CommenL—It has been pointed out
'
to me, by friendly critics, that the hand-stocks,
as described and illustrated, do not absolutely
prevent Mrs. Deane withdrawing her hands.
I agree that with much highly conspicuous
wriggling she might manage it, but I can assure
the reader that it was impossible for
Mrs. Deane to withdraw and reinsert a hand
without my observing it ; and therefore even
more certainly impossible for her to have put
the
"
S
"
and the triangle on the easel unknown
to me, or the triangle and the
"
S
"
on the
Autotype paper with some material capable
of rendering the gelatine insoluble. The dark
room was by no means dark ; there was
light from the ruby window over my shoulder,
and I used my electric torch frequently. ,
I am very acute of hearing and the least sound
brought my torch into action ; I had but to
turn it over to produce the light. Fig. 266
Later on I made another pattern of hand-stocks, as the wood hurt Mrs. Deane‘s
wrist, and I thought a strap would, perhaps, be even more efficacious, though
I had no doubt of the efficacy of the stocks used so far by me.
May 12th, 1925,—Fine sunny day. Mrs. Deane very tired from last night's
séance. She said the séances always made her very tired the next day.
In my experiments to-day I made use of the hand-stocks described in a
previous report. In addition, I had two hanging-papers, a breast-paper and a
head-paper. Result of these, only a small mark on the breast-paper.
H & F EXPTS. Pars. (1060) to (108) Figs. 267, 268 Page 161
(106a) I brought with me, also, a pair of felt shoes with high uppers, specially
made for me, with wooden soles, and two loose blocks of wood ﬁtting in them.
On each of these blocks of wood I ﬁxed, by means of drawing pins, a piece and
a half of half-plate Seltona paper, and inserted a block into each slipper.
Mrs. Deane took her shoes off and put her stockinged feet into these slippers,
wearing them the whole time. Result of experiment with these shoes, nil.
(107) First experiment—Hands imprisoned in the stocks, two pieces of
cameo-white pigmented tissue, one under each hand, one piece of cartridge paper
on easel. Result, an
“
S
”
on one of the tissues ; ﬁfteen minutes.
May 14th, 1925,-~.Weather very bright and sunny.
(108) I used the hand-stocks in all to‘day's experiments. My suggestion to-day
was a triangle. Mrs. Deane wore a head-band and also a breast-paper, and had
her stockinged feet in my felt shoes, with Seltona paper inside
the shoes. Before beginning experiments I remarked to o
Mrs. Deane that I had left my chalks behind, and there was
nothing for the operator to work with. As if to show that the 1
operator was not dependent on my supplying colouring material,
a small, blue-violet coloured triangle appeared on the head-band 9
(Fig. 267). As regards the breast-paper, at the end of the sitting
I found a blackish brown smudge on it. Fig- 267
First experiment—A piece of Seltona paper under each hand and one piece
on the ease] ; ﬁfteen minutes. Result, a few brown smudges on each hand-paper.
Second experiment—Two pieces of sensitised cameo-white pigmented tissue,
one under each hand; ﬁfteen minutes. Result, one indeﬁnite brown mark.
Third experiment—-Mrs. Deane was impressed (she said) to try the second
experiment over again with the same papers. Result of this experiment, nil.
To-day Mrs. Deane was much affected by an article which appeared against
her in a weekly journal.
\
f ova’...
May 21st, 1925,—Very ﬁne day. Mrs. Deane was in good humour.
1 darkened one side of the window, which lets rather too much light through
on bright days. As an extra control, I held Mrs. Deane's hands by placing my
left under her left, and my right over her right, during each experiment to-day.
I suggested the ﬁgure
“

"
to-day. Mrs. Deane wore a head-band and a
breast-paper. I had put Mrs. Deane's stockinged feet in my special felt slippers,
containing boards, each with two pieces of half-plate Seltona printing paper. She
wore these slippers during all four experiments. (See (1064)
1).
161.)
Third expcriment—Two sheets of Seltona paper held between the hands.
After commencing this experiment,
I
opened the door
and took one or two strides in the main room to obtain
a
box to sit on. On my instructions Mrs. Deane put her
hands in the doorway, so that
I
could see them while
I
fetched the box. Before recommencing the experiment,
I
examined the papers and found on the left hand one,
the lower one,
a
large scrawl, something like
a
“9"
reversed, the stroke of
it
being over }-in. wide. There
was nothing on the top paper.
I
had no electric torch
with me to-day. Mrs. Deane held the two papers between
her hands, with mine top and bottom.
I
suggested,
vigorously,
a
“
4," and after ﬁfteen minutes
I
took the
papers away and found
a
big

"
under the palm of her
right hand (Fig. 268) brownish in colour, and brown
ﬁnger-marks.
I
would mention, that Mrs. Deane had
Page 162 Figs. 269, 270 HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS.
dipped her hands in water before the ﬁrst experiment and wiped them on a
duster I had brought with me. I wiped her hands with the duster before each
experiment. I put the Seltona paper into h.\po. The brmm marks got fainter,
but remained. The brown did not run at all.
Fourth ex/wriment— Two focussing screen glasses held under Mrs. Deane's
hands, with my hands under and over as before. There was a grating sound,
as if some sand were between the plates. Mrs. Deane stated she felt as though
there was a second hand under each of her hands, and that her own hands were
separated further than they actually were. I told her that during the third
experiment I had a peculiar idea that my left hand was above my right, and
I had a drowsy feeling. It was only a sensation. I know my hands were as I
placed them originally. I also got, as I have had before, a frontal headache,
quite temporary. There was a faint smudge on one of the plates.

As regards the four Seltona sheets in the shoes, there were small brown
stains on all four; one of them was

May 26th, 1925. u-“Veather cloudy and bright. Mrs. Deane in good humour.
I
examined her hands, which were clean from a recent washing, which they
required, as she had been cutting the grass in the front garden.
I
brought
a
duster and she wiped her hands in my sight before every experiment.
H 8: F EXPERIMENTS Pars. (10.9) (110) Figs. 271,272 Page 163
(109) I put cartridge paper in the two felt shoes.
Mrs. Deane had her feet stockinged. Before I
placed each foot in the shoe lined with cartridge
paper, I got her to rub her feet on a clean piece
of cartridge paper. Neither stocking left the least
mark. I put on her head the head-band of the
previous sitting. I removed it after each
experiment. There was a mark from the previous
sitting. Nothing more came on it. She ﬁxed her
breast-paper as before, under my supervision, as
always. A blackish mark came on this, similar in
colour to a blackish mark which came on one of
the shoe papers. On this shoe-paper three deﬁnite
thick brown marks, not very dark brown (they
have turned very dark brown) not smudges, but
deﬁnite marks (Fig. 271), appeared centrally below
the sole of the foot. Mrs. Deane kicked the shoes
off and I took them. She had no opportunity of Fig 27,o
touching the paper, for I put her feet in the shoes.
First experimmt—l placed my black cloth on Mrs. Deane's lap and it hung
down over her lap and shins to the ﬂoor during each experiment. I had prepared
a frame of wood ij-in. thick with a slot, so that a half-plate could slide in and out.
On the top side of the frame I had ﬁxed strips of copper, each }-in. wide,
transversely, §-in. apart. On the lower surface I had placed similar strips
of zinc. In the slots I slipped two pieces of cartridge paper about 4-in. or 5-in.
wide. Mrs. Deane held the frame between her two hands for ﬁfteen minutes.
The result was two marks on the upper and two on the lower paper in position
between the strips (Fig. 272).
Mrs. Deane showed me after
wards that she could get her
ﬁnger between the strips.
The marks, however, were not
such as a ﬁnger would produce.
They were very light brown,
hardly discernible, Afterwards
they became very dark brown.
Her hands had been wiped,
and Iused my electric torch
off and on, supplementary to
the light from the window.
To-day I suggested a
“

”
or a Greek ¢ (Phi.). She said
she did not know what a Greek
Phi was.
(110) Second experiment—
The holding, between Mrs.
Deane's hands, of twelve pieces _
of wax paper, pinned together
at one corner, furthest from her
wrists. I continued the sug
gestion. The pressure and
6 5 L 5R
heat of her hands caused the 2 0 2
sheets to cohere somewhat. _
After the experiment I took F's-271
the wax paper away from Mrs. Deane, and I saw that the upper surface had a

"
on it. I pulled the inner pieces apart and found a large
"
3
"
on one
of the inner sheets (Fig. 273E). On examining the top sheet again, I found that the
small
“
3
"
now formed part of a larger design, that is to say, something extra
had appeared since I ﬁrst examined it, while holding il in my hand in the main
room (Fig. 273D).
(I 1 1) Third experiment—I used the hand-stocks with a piece of blank cartridge
paper pinned on the easel. I put the black cloth on Mrs. Deane's lap and legs
as before. She placed her hands on the board and I imprisoned them by means
of the easel, as previously described. I then placed under her hands a board
with two, half-plate size, Autotype white-cameo pigmented tissues, which I had
sensitised the night before and dried. I continued my suggestion of a "3."
After ﬁfteen minutes, I removed the board, and while Mrs. Deane's hands were
still imprisoned, I rubbed each hand on a piece of plain cartridge paper. Neither
hand left any mark. I felt her hands all over and got no mark. I examined her
hands afterwards and found them free from any marks. There was one big
"3” on each of the tissues, brown in colour. They were in the same position
on each paper, viz. ; the left hand top corner. One of them is like ribbon, not
like a ﬁnger streak (Fig. 2733). There was a light-brown

On developing the tissues the glasses became quite clear, except as regards the
"
3's
"
(Figs. B and C), each overlaid with white insoluble gelatine.
Fourth experiment—We remained in the cabinet, and I gave Mrs. Deane two
half-plate focussing screens to hold between her hands, while I held my hands
clasped over hers. We sat for about ten minutes. Result, very slight, if any,
marks. I took everything away with me.
(1 1 la) Comment—I consider to-day's results exceedingly good and evidential.
It is really out of the question that Mrs. Deane put the
“
3's
"
on the various
materials in any normal manner. One cannot render the tissue insoluble by
simply rubbing it with the ﬁnger, and where Mrs. Deane's hands were pressing
on the tissues they left no effects.
0
The originals have only to be seen for
anyone capable of accepting such new evidence, to recognise the impossibility
of the marks having been made by Mrs. Deane normally. To-day's work is
good proof of Mrs. Deane's curious power.
June 2nd, 1925,—A bright day. Mrs. Deane well.
(1 12) Head-band, papers in felt shoes, put in by myself with great precautions ;
breast-paper ; no result except on the breast-paper. Two light pinky-yellow
marks, which turned deep-brown, one lI-in.Xif-in. (Fig. 287, page 170). This
illustration is put on page 170 to enable the reader to compare it with a similar
mark obtained on the easel paper on June 11th.
Second experiment—A packet of wax paper held
between Mrs. Deane's hands for ﬁfteen minutes. Her
hands were imprisoned in my cardboard tube during
this experiment. I suggested a capital
"
B." Result,
no coloration anywhere. There was an impression
on the top sheet, a little over an inch long, which might
be taken for a
"
B." The
“
B
"
came out more distinctly
after some days (Fig. 274).
(1 13) Some months after this day I found a faint "B"
on an inside page of this packet. It had taken a long
time to become visible.
(114) Third experiment—Two sensitised Autotype
cameo-white half-plate size tissues, brought with me, ,
already pinned on a board side by side. Before this ex- 7
periment, I examined Mrs. Deane's hands again, and
wiped them with a clean duster I had brought with me.
I had not the hand-stocks with me to-day. I had my
ruby electric torch and used it frequently. Mrs. Deane put her hands ﬂat on the
two pieces of tissue. The palms were slightly cupped in the usual natural
relaxed condition. I suggested
'
Fig. 274
a
“
B." Mrs. Deane asked me
why. I said, because it was
easy to write in one stroke. She
suggested a capital
“
B
"
was a
two-stroke letter. I pointed out
that the straight stroke could be
produced by an upward move
ment, of which the two loops
could be a continuation. My
suggestion was a capital" B"
on one sheet and an
“
S
"
on the
other. I kept on repeating it, and
a‘
managed to get a slight laugh ,5 all!
out of Mrs. Deane. This I con
sider useful. The result was a Fig 275 Fig- 276
Page [56'Figs. 277 to 279 Pars. (114a) (115) H & F EXPERIMENTS
thick brown
“
B" on the right sheet, about li-in. in height,
made with a single stroke as described by me. On the
left sheet there was a brown
“
S," also about Ill-in. high
(Figs. 275 and 276, page 165). These tissues were devel
oped by me and left the marks fairly thick on the glass
supports, accompanied with white insoluble gelatine.
(1 14¢) Fourth exj>eriment—Two pieces of focussing screen
held between Mrs. Deane's hands imprisoned in the narrow
cardboard tube, from which Mrs. Deane withdrew her
hands, while I held the glass plates from the opposite
open end. Result, a light pearly mark of fair size on
each plate. I happened on the 19th of June to look at
these plates and noticed that the marks had become
distinct, on the one a large
" S," and on the other a mark
<17’
which I read as a
"
B
"
(Fig. 277).

June 4th, 1925,—Mrs. Deane complained of a bad night.
She wore the head-band of previous sittings, a breast-paper, and papers
in her felt shoes.
First experimenL—I gave her a piece of cartridge paper, folded in two,
which had been impregnated with an acid solution of sulphate of quinine,
to hold between her hands for ﬁfteen minutes. Result, a few ﬁne brown spots
appeared later.
(115) Second experimenL—Twelve sheets (twenty-four pages) of wax-paper,
pinned together at the top left hand comer, held between Mrs. Deane's hands for
ﬁfteen minutes. As usual I stood opposite her, watching.
I suggested a capital "W" during all to-day's experiments, and tried to
make Mrs. Deane laugh. This wax paper was the same as held on the last occasion,
when I suggested a "B." On that day I noticed a faint depression without
colour on page one, which suggested a
“
B," l-in. high. It was but a suggestion.
To-day, a brown stain, which certainly recalls a
“
B," shows at that particular
spot (Fig. 274, page 165). Evidently it was latent. At the termination of to-day's
experiment I found the wax sheets coherent. On opening them in various places
and looking through them at the
light, I saw on an inside page
the faintest indication of a large
"W," so faint that it could
easily be simply the result of
Fig- 278 Fig. 279
creases in the paper. I could discern no other mark on any of the inside sheets.
The next day there was a distinct light, dirty-grey, large
"
W
"
in the position,
HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (116) to (118) Page 167
and of the shape and size I noticed at ﬁrst. On Saturday, June 6th, the
“
W ”
was quite distinct on page 13 of the packet inside (Fig. 278, page 166). These
facts are corroborated by one of my lady clerks, who examined the papers
with me on each occasion, so it is not a case of hallucination on my part.
Third experimenL—Mrs. Deane0s hands imprisoned in the stocks over
sensitised Autotype white tissue; ﬁfteen minutes. A piece of plain paper
pinned on the cascl. No visible result, but, on developing, one glass support
showed a conglomeration of brownish specks.
(116) Fourth experimenL—Mrs. Deane's hands in stocks over two focussing
glass screens. No result. Result on easel-paper, three parts of a
"
W” (Fig.
279, page 166).
No result on head-paper. No result on foot-paper. 0n the breast-paper a
small light brown-black mark with a slight wave, giving it a
"
W" character,
on the side away from the skin.
June 9th, 1925,—A bright sunny day. Mrs. Deane in good humour.
1 darkened the room. The dark-room was dark. I had a new battery in my
electric torch, which gave a brilliant light. I used it frequently, and I am sure
Mrs. Deane did not move her hands away from whatever she was holding.
Head-band, breast-paper, two pieces of paper in wooden-soled felt shoes.
First experimenL—Mrs. Deane held between her hands the frame with
zinc and copper strips and string wound across them as used in previous sitting ;
ﬁfteen minutes, no result. Nothing on head-band. On the lower shelf I had
placed a box (open) containing a dozen sticks of coloured chalks.
(11 7) Second experimenL—During this and the subsequent experiments I told
Mrs. Deane I was going to suggest she should put on the various papers, etc.,
a letter I was thinking
of.
I
wrote an
“
N
"
down on a piece of card. Mrs. Deane
could not see me, nor did she know
I
was doing it.
I
kept repeating the
suggestion, not mentioning the letter, except as stated in the last to-day's
experiment.
I
gave Mrs. Deane
a
packet of twenty-four sheets, pinned together
at the top left-hand corner, which
I
told her was wax-paper, but which
I
found
out afterwards was what
is
known as silk-glazed, to hold between her hands
while
I
watched. This paper differs from wax in that one can write on
it
with
ink. Fifteen minutes duration of this experiment.
I
took the packet away
from Mrs. Deane, and, on holding
it
up to the light a few leaves at
a
time,
I
saw
one mark about li-in. Xi-in. (Fig. 281, page 168).
It
was not wet, but
it
appeared
to have damped the paper. It was on the inside page 21, and represents (at
a
stretch) an “n." There was a slight stain in juxtaposition on page 20.
I
then noticed
there was a mark on another inside page.
I
did not ﬁnd this when
I
ﬁrst
examined the packet after the experiment. It appears to have come on while
I
was holding the papers. They were pinned together at the left-hand top
corner. The second mark was irregular, roundish, about l-in. in diameter.
It
was not wet, but the paper appeared limp under it. This was page 39.
There was a slight stain on page 38. One cannot conceive how the contiguous
pages were not equally stained. Nothing on the head-band.
(118) Third experimenL—l put Mrs. Deane's hands in the hand-stocks, with
a
piece of cartridge paper fastened on the easel. (Before this experiment
Mrs. Deane placed her two hands on my head while
I
thought of the letter "N.")
Under her hands
I
placed two pieces of cameo-white pigmented tissue, sensitised
overnight, and well dried, and pinned side by side on
a
board. We sang
" Abide
with me
"
and
I
suggested, vigorously, "Mrs. Deane will, Mrs. Deane must,
put the letter
I
am thinking
of
on the paper under her hands, on the easel, on
head-band, on the breast-paper, on the foot-paper." The result of this
experiment, which lasted ﬁfteen minutes, was
a
deﬁnite
“
N
"
on the head-band
Page 168 Figs. 280 to 284 Par. (119) H a- 1: EXPERIMENTS.
(Fig. 280) and an indeﬁnite “N" on the paper on
the ease] (Fig. 282), and by the side of that was a
large vermilion coloured mark, which was wet. The
‘
i
ii “i
Fig. 280 Fig. 281 Fig. 282
vermilion mark measures 2§-in. X 2-in., and my nephew, when he saw it, called
it an
"
S." A portion only of this is shown in the ﬁgure. The
"
N
"
was light
brownish-black. Quite impossible for Mrs. Deane to have put these marks on
the paper on the easel without my knowledge. She remarked that the
red probably came from one of the chalks. The chalks were all side by side in
the box, and she picked one out, which corresponds exactly in colour with the
mark on the easel paper. On one of the pigmented tissues there were some
light brown marks, indeﬁnite in shape. The other tissue was blank. On trans
ferring these later at my ofﬁce on to glass, two large designs of the white gelatine
remained on the glass, much larger than the brown marks. Everything washed
off the glass to which I transferred the blank tissue, no gelatine was rendered
insoluble in that one.
(119) F0urth expﬁrimeilt—I replaced the head-band. I. put a new piece of
paper on the easel. I wiped Mrs. Deane's hands carefully with my duster, as
I did before every experiment. I imprisoned her hands with the easel and
placed two focussing glass
screens under her hands. I
vigorously suggested
"
the
letter I am thinking of," but
on this occasion the letter
“
N"
slipped out twice, but as I was
talking rapidly and droning, l
.dv-
-W».
‘_m
Fig. 283 Fig. 284
am sure Mrs. Deane did not notice
it
consciously.
I
asked her (not immediately
after the slip) whether she had any idea of the letter
I
was suggesting. She
said
"
No. Was
it
a
0
P
'
?
"
She may have mistaken the
"
S
"
previously
HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (120) (120a) Page 169
obtained on the easel paper for a "P." During this experiment I placed the
box of chalks on the ledge of the easel. One of the pieces fell down. It was a
light pink piece. The result was, on the easel paper, a deﬁnite
“
N," ll-in. broad
and ll-in. high, strokes ﬁ-in. broad, light brown; it has not turned dark. There
was also a thin, bent line, violet in colour, somewhat like an
“
N
"
(Fig. 284,
page 168), and a faint "N" on one of the glasses (Fig. 283, page 168).
(120) On the breast paper there was a red smear (of the same colour as the
“
S
"
on the easel) on the side away from the skin. As regards the foot-papers
in the slippers there was a large solid mark near the heel of the right foot, 2l-in.
long, ﬁ-in. wide, pinkish-brown of different shades; it turned dark-brown.
On the edge of the paper—this edge was an upright fold of the bottom piece,
3-in. high—were slight stains, both inside and outside, as though the paper
there had got marked while the colour was apported (?) to make the larger
mark under the foot. Before Mrs. Deane inserted her stockinged feet (she
wore silk stockings to-day) I put a piece of plain cartridge paper under each
foot in turn, and she wiped each foot on this paper, leaving no mark.
Immediately after wiping I placed each foot in its shoe. I personally removed
each shoe.
C0mmenl.—T his report was written out the day of the experiment.
I consider this large brown mark excellent evidence of the work of an invisible
operator with apported material. It was quite impossible for Mrs. Deane to
have access to the paper inside the felt shoe without my knowledge. These
shoes were made specially for me with high uppers to prevent any such access.
I was close to her the whole time. The paper was 7-in. long, 10-in. wide,
folded in three, 3g-in. under the foot, 3-in. upright on one side 3l-in. on the
other. The two small marks were not larger than a 3d. piece, right on one
top edge (both sides of it) 3-in. away from the large mark ; nothing could have
been poured in. Certainly the paper could not have been removed without
my knowledge, besides any liquid would have stained her sock and the shoe
which I should have seen.
June Ilth, 1925,—Fine, very sunny day. Mrs. Deane in good humour.
(120a) Head-band; taken off after each experiment. Breast-paper left in all the
time. On this occasion it was a double paper. Mrs. Deane's feet naked, placed
on two large pieces of plain cartridge paper, one above the other. her feet being
wiped on a preliminary piece of paper. A bowl of water under chair. End of
cartridge paper lay on top of bowl. Fcot-papers removed after each experiment.
Box of chalks put on lowest shelf. Electric red light torch freely used.
Dark-room quite dark. The suggestion to-day was a Greek Omega (which
Mrs. Deane afterwards stated she did not know was a Greek letter, but con
nected with something biblical) and the letter of the English alphabet I am
thinking of. For the ﬁrst two experiments I thought of a
“
Y," but afterI slipped
this letter out by mistake, though unnoticed by Mrs. Deane, I changed the letter,
in my mind, for the last two experiments, into an
"
R," which I wrote in the dark
on the back of a postcard several times, holding the postcard vertically, close
to me. Mrs. Deane could not see anything of what I was writing. I wrote this
down ﬁrst as a piece of testimony, and, secondly, because the written word might
help perhaps in telepathy.
Firsl experimenL—Frame with zinc and copper slips crossed by string ﬁxed
in position by gummed paper strips, leaving holes too small for the ﬁnger-tips ;
ﬁfteen minutes. Result, four small smudges on the lower paper, one small smudge
on the upper paper, all occupying the square openings. There was some stain on
the string in some of these places. Of course I wiped Mrs. Deane's hands before
all experiments with my duster, brought with me. There were no marks on
her ﬁngers. There was a faint mark like a "C "
on the head-band.
Page 170 Figs. 286 to 290 Pars. (121) to (123) H & F EXPERIMENTS.
Second experimenL—A thick packet of ninety-six
sheets of wax paper held between Mrs. Deane's hands;
ﬁfteen minutes. Result, 21small brownish-black mark on
the outside of top sheet. The sheets had all cohered.
There was nothing inside or on the bottom. Next
morning my clerk and I observed a very faint large oval
on the top sheet. Nothing on foot-papers up to now.
(121) Third experimenL—Hands
in stocks, paper on easel, white
cameo tissue under hands. Sugges
tion of letters Omega openly, and
"
R
"
mentally, all the time; ﬁfteen
minutes. There was a good deal
of a kind of tapping. I called the
alphabet. but got nothing deﬁnite.
Result, a large, 2-in.Xl-in., blue
mark (apparently done with one of
the chalks) on the easel paper
(Fig. 286). It is very curious that
this indeﬁnite mark should resemble so closely an indeﬁnite
mark which I found on the breast-paper on June 2nd
(Fig. 287). On the white cameo pigmented tissue under
left hand some faint brown marks. Nothing on the other.
(122) Fourth experiment—Mrs. Deane's hands remained in the stocks. She held
them in the fourth experiment on the ground surfaces of
the two focussing glasses. I had turned the easel paper over.
After ﬁfteen minutes I removed the easel and took the glasses
away. I can assert truly that I never let the letter
“
R
"
slip
from my tongue. I found nothing more on the easel paper.
On the right glass was a small "R” (Fig. 289), (my mental
suggestion), on the left an
“
S
"
(Fig. 288) both in yellow chalk.
(123) Nothing more on the head-band. On the foot-paper was
a large blue mark or smudge at the right side of the right foot,
evidently a blue chalk mark.
Mrs. Deane pulled out the breast
paper. and on the side next the
skin, near the top, was a large blue
stroke with the curves of a Greek
Omega (Fig. 290). The central loop
was much larger than that of an
ordinary
"
Omega," but the shape
was the same. The chalks were in
their original positions in their box, as far as I
could judge. Omega was the suggestion. Fig. 290
During the last experiment there was a sound as
of writing, and we were disappointed not to ﬁnd writing on the ease] paper.
It is not unusual with us to hear the sound as of writing and to ﬁnd nothing.
June 16th, 1925,—Mrs. Deane complained of not having slept. Weather
very hot indeed. It was very hot in the dark-room.
Naked feet on two layers of plain paper; breast-paper and head-paper.
I took head-paper and foot-paper away after each experiment. All the usual
precautions taken as regards wiping, etc.
During all to-day's experiments I suggested the Greek "Alpha," or an
English letter I was thinking of, which was a
“
Y."

H & F EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (124) to (127) Fig. 291 Page 171
(124) First exper-iment—Two pieces, making eight pages, of folded cartridge
paper held between Mrs. Deane's hands ; ﬁfteen minutes. I held my hands, one
above, one below, Mrs. Deane's; result, a large brown mark on the bottom sheet.
(125) Second experimenL—The thick packet of wax paper, ninety-six sheets,
used on the last occasion, held between Mrs. Deane's hands. They cohered into one
block; duration ﬁfteen minutes. On the top and bottom surfaces I found
large indeﬁnite brown stains, and inside between two sheets, where the packet
opened most easily, was a brown mark.
Third cxperiment—As I had not the stocks with me, I used a cardboard
box, 12-in. X9-in. and 2l-in. high, with a lid. I out two holes in one side, just
large enough to take Mrs. Deane's wrists. Having examined and wiped her
hands, I placed under them, in the box, a board with two pieces of half-plate
size, cameo-white pigmented tissue, sensitised overnight. Removed after ﬁfteen
minutes. I found an indeﬁnite brown mark on one of them. I explained
to Mrs. Deane that the
“
Alpha
"
was a Greek "A." On the lowest shelf, at the
beginning of to-day's work, I had placed an open box with twelve coloured
chalks lying side by side.
Fourth experimenL—I placed Mrs. Deane's hands in the box, having put there,
ﬁrst, two pieces of focussing glass, ground surface upwards. I suggested,
vigorously, the Greek
“
Alpha
"
and the letter I was thinking of. After ﬁfteen
minutes I found on the left focussing glass a well-written English
“
A," ll-in.
high, and on the right hand glass an
"
S
"
2-in. high, also well written. These
were light blue in colour. The colour was the same as that of a stick of blue
chalk among the dozen ; they were both quite dry. I need not repeat that I
took all the usual precautions.
No mark on the head-band, nor on the foot-papers, which had been put in
position during each experiment. Nothing on the breast-paper.
June 18th, 1925,—Weather cooler, but sunny. Shutters and blind drawn
in main room. Dark-room dark. I used my torch. Mrs. Deane unusually
ﬁdgety at the beginning. On one occasion I found her left hand quite away
from the wax-paper she was holding. Head-paper, breast-paper, and foot
paper. The feet were bare. Nothing came on the foot-papers.
(126) During all to-day's experiments I suggested a Greek“ Gamma," or the
letter I was thinking of. I thought of a
“
Y "
; I had written it down on a piece
of paper in the 'bus going to Mrs. Deane's,
0 7
0..—
which paper I kept in my pocket. No result '
’ 0
on the pigmented tissue.
Iremoved head-band. I inspected it with
the torch before the experiment. On re
moving it, I found two small blackish-brown
marks with white sparkling crystals on them.
(127) Fourth experimenL—’I wiped Mrs.
Deane's hands carefully and placed beneath
them two plain focussing screens, rough side
upwards. I kept on with my suggestion for
ﬁfteen minutes. Her hands were in the box
used at the last sitting. On the focussing -
screens were large pearly, silky, white marks,
one a distinct
“
Y” (Fig. 291), the other, a awn/51
scroll ; both turned quite brown. I declare
' '
'
I never mentioned the letter
"
Y," which I IZ0QU/ROUZSL a
was mentally suggesting. Mrs. Deane guessed *c_-_,r-_
I was thinking of a printed
“
E."
Page I 72 Figs. 292 to 294 Pars. (128) to (130) H A“ l: EXPERIMENTS.
Fzfth experimmt—After I removed the
lid, I took away the focussing screens and
substituted for them the two tissues
previously used. I put the lid on the box.
During this and the focussing screens
experiment, I kept on with the suggestions
before mentioned. After about ﬁve minutes
I took off the lid and removed the tissues,
which were pinned down ﬂat side by side
on cardboard. On the left tissue was a
large brown mark. somewhat like a
"
C
"
reversed, 2l-in. to 3-in. long, and l-in.
thick (Fig. 292). It is interesting to compare
this with a mark which appeared on a
focussing screen on April 21st last (Fig.293).
Mrs. Deane had not removed her hands
from the box since placing them on the
focussing screens, and there was no brown
mark on the focussing screens.
Fig. 292
June 25th, 1925.—A brightish day. Mrs.
Deane in good form.
(128) I had brought a pair of cotton gloves,
which Mrs. Deane put on in the main room.
Head-band on, breast-paper, 9-in. X 7-in.; this
she inserted while the gloves were on her
hands, in my presence, in the main room. I
was close by Mrs. Deane while she put it inside
her dress in the main room. The whole paper
was lost from view. It was not easy to withdraw
this paper, as I saw, and more difﬁcult to insert
it (9-in. X 7-in.), and as I was in close proximity
to Mrs. Deane the whole of the sitting, and had
her under observation the whole time; I can assert,
as conﬁdently as I can assert anything, that she
had no opportunity to put any mark upon this
paper. She had no access to the chalks I brought
before she inserted the paper; yet when she
withdrew it in my presence at the end of the Fig-193
sitting, there was a large blue "5" (2l-in. high) upon it on the ﬂesh side, as if
made with one of my chalks.
(129) I suggested to-day two letters I was thinking of, the Greek "R"
and an English
"
Z." In repeating the suggestion of the Greek letter, the
“
R
"
slipped off my tongue, but Mrs. Deane is ignorant of Greek.
(130) Fourth experimenL—Barc hands in box over two clean
pieces of focussing glass. Hands carefully examined and wiped.
Fingers opened out. There was a quarter-plate box body on the
shelf containing three coloured chalks, one light blue, one dark
blue, and one red ; ﬁfteen minutes. On one plate came an "S" and
an "R” (Fig. 294). 0n the other came several marks, one of I(
which is an English "R" and another like the curve of the
y
0\
Greek letter “r," but the tail is very short (Fig. 295, page 173).
\
All these marks are in the light blue of one of the chalks
'
They were quite dry. It is practically certain Mrs. Deane can
not write the Greek alphabet. Fig- 294
H 8: F EXPERIMENTS. Par. (131) Figs. 295, 296 Page 173
During two of these experiments Mrs. Deane
complained of a great pain in her right arm, like
severe rheumatism. While she had her hand in the
box she said "Oh ! it is awful from the elbow to
the tips of the ﬁngers." Mostly in the ﬁrst
experiment. Mrs. Deane reverted to the wonderful
way her arm had healed from the bite. She said her
ﬂesh always healed well. Mrs. Deane has complained
frequently of this pain in the arm, mostly when we
get no results under the hands.
Fifth experiment—After the glass experiment I kept Mrs. Deane's hands
in the box while I removed the glasses and substituted for them the board
with the two pieces of unsensitised tissues of the ﬁrst experiment, and put the
lid on the box. Five minutes. There were heavy large brown marks on
the left piece.
Fig. 295
Jun; 30th, 1925,—Weather bright. Room darkened. Head-paper, breast-paper,
foot-paper. I suggested, openly, a Greek "Sigma," and, mentally, the letter "O."
Firsl experiment—Hand-stocks. Hands over unsensitised, cameo-white
tissue, cartridge paper on easel, ﬁfteen minutes ; a mark appeared, Ii-in. X 2-in.,
on the easel paper, which turned darker A deﬁnite result.
July 2nd, 1925,—Very warm, bright day. Mrs. Deane complained of two
bad nights—“ She thought she would have died !
"
Breast-paper, foot-paper,
easel-paper in position. A ll-in.
“
S
”
reversed, brown, came on the breast-paper.
In all to-day's experiments I vigorously suggested the Greek letter
“
Sigma,"
and the letter I was thinking of, viz. : a capital
“
G," written with a tail.
131) Second cxperiment-—Sixteen
pieces of wax-paper pinned at one
corner, held between Mrs. Deane's
hands. Good observation kept by me;
ﬁfteen minutes. Result : a curved horn
shaped mark on an inside page of the
packet. (Fig. 296, the lowest). This horn
shaped mark is similar to a batch of
horn-shaped marks which I had been
examining at my chambers this week,
which were Extras in a set of
Mrs. Deane's prints. (Fig. 296, the
four upper ones). I had not spoken to
Mrs. Deane about these Extras, but had
been much struck with them.
In Light of Oct. 30th, 1926, appeared
an article by Mr. R. H. Saunders, in
the course of which he gives an account
of sittings he and a friend had with
two different mediums, at both of which
an ancient Egyptian was described as
the guide of Mr. Saunders' friend. Mr. Saunders goes on to say :
“
As further
conﬁrmation of this ancient Egyptian being connected with my friend, a capital
test was given through Mrs. Deane, who, of course, knew nothing of this sitting
with the two mediums. An appointment was made by me for a supernormal
picture, and Mrs. Deane had no idea even of the sex of the friend I was bringing,
or what the name was. The photograph showed a crested serpent encircling the
head of my friend, and another photograph showed the curved arm of a chair
ornamented with a carved lion's head with a duck's bill." Mrs. Deane informed
Page I 74 Figs. 29 7, 298 Pars. (131a) to (133) H & F EXPERIMENTS.
me that the ﬁrst sitter with whom this curved mark appeared was Mr. Gillmour,
of Belfast. The memories of most living people were full of pictures connected
with the recent discovery of Tutankhamen's tomb.
(131a) CommenL—The appearance of this mark on an inside page of the
packet of wax papers is really extraordinary.
(132) Third experiment—Mrs. Deane's hands in stocks over sensitised white
cameo tissues, two half-plate pieces, side by side, sensitised overnight by me. Piece
of plain paper on the easel. Fifteen minutes. Result: A brown oval mark,
2i-in.Xl-in. on the paper on the easel ; two deep thick brown marks on the
left piece of sensitised tissue. On squeegeeing it the two marks showed as
depressions on the back, proving that the gelatine had been deeply affected.
Fourth experimenL—Mrs. Deane's hands still in stocks. Two half-plate
focussing glass screens, one under each hand; ten minutes. On both came
soapy, pearly marks, one an
“
S
"
shaped scroll, 2i-in. X l-in., and the other
a very big conglomerate indeﬁnite mark covering nearly the whole of the plate.
Nothing on the easel-paper. The soapy marks darkened next day.
July 7th, 1925,—Mrs. Deane complained of
having passed a bad night with villainous dreams
and a bad headache. She took two aspirins.
During all the experiments to-day I suggested
the Greek letter
"
Mu
”
and the English letter I
was thinking of, which was a capital "E," as
written.
Third experimenL—Mrs. Deane's hands in stocks,
paper on easel, two pieces of unsensitised, white
cameo tissue under hands; ﬁfteen minutes.
Result ; a brown mark on one.
Before the second experiment I placed a piece
of ferroprussiate paper I had prepared, and which
was still dampish, under Mrs. Deane's feet.
I removed it, and replaced it for each subsequent
experiment. The result on this paper was a large
number of small specks, all about the feet, and large
speckled stains, whitish blue, near the outside of Fig- 297
the toes of her feet. Ferroprussiate papers
always washed by me at my factory after 9
the sittings.
(133) Fourth experimenL—Hands retained
in stocks. Two pieces of sensitised carbon
tissue placed under Mrs. Deane's hands, plain
paper on easel; thirteen minutes. Result: A ,
large, heavy brown mark on the left-hand
piece, a very good
" G," which letter I had
thought of last week. The right hand tissue
showed the same
“
G," but broken. A mark
also on the easel. The lower small portion
brown, the upper larger blot, light yellow,
and very light brown or cream colour; it
turned darker. (Figs. 297 and 298).
Fifth experimenL—Mrs. Deane's hands
still in stocks, two focussing glass screens Fig- “3
placed under hands, same paper on easel, ﬁve minutes. Nothing more on
easel-paper; faintish pearly marks, undeﬁned, on glasses, which darkened.
Nothing on head-paper, nothing on breast-paper.
H & F EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (134) to (137) Fig. 299 Page 175
July 9th, 1925,—Mrs. Deane in good form, but complained of a continual
headache.
(134) Second experimenL—Sixteen sheets of clean wax paper, pinned together
at one corner, held between Mrs. Deane's hands; ﬁfteen minutes. Result, an
irregular brown mark, 3-in. X l-in., turning nearly black, between two inner
sheets, one of them was quite dry. Large brown marks were found by me
later at my ofﬁce, on an outside page.
During all experiments to-day I suggested the Greek letter
"
Mu
"
and the
English letter I was thinking of, which was a written
"
E."
Fourth experimenL—The conversation ran on Mrs. Deane learning to write.
She spoke a good deal about pothooks and hangers.
Fifth experimenL—I substituted for the board with the two tissues, two
half-plate focussing screens. During this experiment there was a continuous
slight grating, hardly taps, on the glass. The result was a large well-formed
blue
"
S," 2ﬁ-in. high on the right-hand glass, in blue chalk, and on the left a
thin blue line of uniform thickness, in the shape of a pothook, and one or two
indeﬁnite scrawls of the same uniform thickness, all in blue chalk. As mentioned,
Mrs. Deane was talking to-day of pot-hooks and hangers.
July 14th, 1925,—Warm and bright. Mrs. Deane complained she was
feeling unwell. Head-paper, breast-paper, foot-paper.
Under the naked feet I had, on the top, a sheet of ferroprussiate paper,
and under that a sheet of citrate of iron paper placed in a large enamelled iron
tray. Mrs. Deane had her feet in this during the last four experiments. The
result was a large, heavy, brown mark on the right, outside and inside of the
right foot at the top. Usual precautions, wiping feet, etc. I need not always
mention that I always had the ﬂash-lamp in use and a clean duster, and wiped
Mrs. Deane's hands and feet and examined them, and rubbed them on paper.
(135) I suggested to-day the Greek
letter "Sigma" and a short English
word I was thinking
of,
which was the 0
word
"
god
"
;
of course, simply as
a
word,
a
word suggested to me by
a
continental experiment. Q
(136) Fourth experiment — Mrs
Deane's hands still in stocks; ﬁfteen
minutes; two focussing glass screens put
under her hands; suggestion repeated
frequently.
A
second quarter-plate
exposed on easel as before. Result
on glass plates: On one an "S" in
a
white chalk, on the other some marks,

P
which, looked at from the clear side,
can be read as
"
no go
"
;
my mental Fig. 299
suggestion to-day was the word "god
"
(Fig. 299, the one as received, the other the same reversed).
It
is
curious that the
two letters
"
go
"
of the word god should appear
;
also the expression
“
no go."*
(137) Fifth experimenL—Without removing Mrs. D.’s hands,
I
substituted for
the glasses the same board with the two unsensitised tissues used in the
third experiment, but during the last experiment this board with tissues
facing downwards had been lying over
a
bowl of water, the idea being to
damp the sheets. While these were under Mrs. Deane's hands for ﬁfteen minutes,
I
suggested, that
if
the operators could not put on the letter and word
I
wanted,
oI had felt a certain compunetion at using this word god.
Page 176' Figs. 300 to 302 Par. (138) H & F EXPERIMENTS.
they should, at least, put on a thick, heavy, dark stroke, and render the gelatine
insoluble. The result was, a heavy, darkish mark on the left-hand sheet,
3-in. X é-in. (Fig. 300). It turned darker, but not as dark as the marks on sensitised
sheets. On the easel-paper I found an
“
S
”
in purple chalk. There was a piece
of white chalk, also a purple chalk in the open box. At the end of the "S" is a
Greek
"
Sigma"(?) in reverse (Fig. 301). Mrs. Deane would not know what I meant
by a Greek
“
Sigma." Nothing on head-paper; nothing on breast-paper.
gum/111
Fig. 300 ms 301
July 16th, 1925,—Mrs. Deane in good form, but rather quiet.
To-day
I
was suggesting all the time the Greek "Sigma," and the short word,
or the ﬁrst letter of it,
I
was thinking of, which was the word
"
god."
(138) Second experiment— Wax paper
between Mrs. Deane's hands, sixteen sheets
pinned together at left-hand top corner.
I
had a
new battery with my ﬂash-lamp, and kept guard
over her.
I
afﬁrm, with all assurance, that she
did not move her hands from the position they
occupied ﬂat on the top and bottom sheets of
the packet of wax-paper. The wax sheets
cohered through the pressure and warmth, and
Mrs. Deane did not, and could not, unobserved 0
by me, get at the inside sheets, and yet, when
I
took the packet away from her, on looking
through the packet at the light,
I
saw
a
distinct
broad ring, an
“
0
"
about li-in. in diameter,
and above it, a large "H" in Roman type
(Oh
!
?)
(Fig. 302). Impossible for Mrs. Deane
to have put these two letters on the paper
unobserved by me, and even less possible so
perfectly. They were on an inside sheet.
Fourth experiment—Mrs. Deane's hands
.
remained in stocks.
I
substituted focussing
glass screens for the papers.
I
had the chalks
on the shelf; ﬁfteen minutes. During this experiment
I
exposed
a
second
quarter-plate on the easel. On one of the focussing glasses came
a
large,
indistinct, greyish, pearly mark, 3.1_.-in. X 2§-in., like
a
serpent coiled up. For
result of developing the quarter-plate see page 55, par. (15).

H 8: F EXPERIMENTS. Par. (139) Figs. 303, 304 Page 177
July 23rd, 1925,—Mrs. Deane was very sorry for herself this morning.
(139) I suggested the Greek letter "Mu" and the letter I was thinking of,
which was a
“
G."
Third experimenL—Mrs. Deane dipped her hands in a basin of water I had
fetched before opening the proceedings, and wiped them on the clean duster
I had brought with me. I locked her hands in my stocks, which I had brought
with me ; I never leave these stocks behind. While her hands were imprisoned
in the stocks I examined them, wiped them again with the duster, rubbed them
on a piece of paper and examined them with my torch. I then placed under
Mrs. Deane's hands a board with two pieces of unsensitised carbon tissue.
This board is so thick that it renders it even more impossible for Mrs. Deane to
withdraw her hands from the stocks. All being in order, I placed the open
box of chalks on the lowest shelf at the height of Mrs. Deane's knees. All this
time Mrs. Deane's lap and shins were covered with my black cloth. During
this experiment, which lasted ﬁfteen minutes, I suppli
cated and commanded the operator to put the Greek
letter "Mu" on the right-hand piece, and the letter
I was thinking of on the left-hand piece, to make the
streaks broad and dark, and to render the gelatine
insoluble. The result was the two tissues were marked
with yellow pastel chalk. On the right-hand piece were
the words
"
no go
"
(Fig. 303) (see report of 14th inst.),
and on the left-hand piece the letter
"
S
"
in chalk,
and a mark in brown (not in chalk). oa -
During this experiment Mrs. Deane complained of
great pain in the right arm from above the elbow.
She asked me, while this was going on. whether I had
ever known anyone who had had his arm cut off above
the elbow; I said 0. “Certainly I had," as I was
named Frederic after a gentleman who had had his arm
cut off above the elbow. As soon as Iadmitted that,
Mrs. Deane stated the pain ceased, and her explanation
was, that the person aforesaid was identifying himself,
and was satisﬁed when he had achieved his purpose. I had never mentioned
him to Mrs. Deane. He lived and died in Dublin many years ago. (It
was his right arm which was absent.)
During this experiment I had placed on the easel of the stocks a pair of
quarter-plates, Marion Brilliant, sensitive side towards Mrs. Deane. On my
request she breathed once upon each. After this third experiment I removed
these plates and put them in their box face to face,
Fourth experiment—I did not remove
Fill» 303
Mrs. Deane's hands from the stocks, but
removed the board with the cameo tissues
(unsensitised) and replaced it with two clean
focussing screens, rough sides up. I put another
pair of quarter-plates on the easel. I continued
my suggestions and asked also for the same
marks to come on the quarter-plates. I did the
same in the last experiment. After a quarter
of an hour I asked Mrs. Deane to raise her hands
from the plates while I removed the plates. I
removed also the quarter-plates from the easel
and put them in a box with the others. _
Before releasing Mrs. Deane's hands, I F'g0 3°4
removed the head-band and the foot-paper.

(140) Result on the focussing glasses : On
the right-hand one, a lot of indeﬁnite marks with
yellow pastel chalk and a lot of fragments of the
chalk (Fig. 304, page 177). The marks suggested
to me a sketch of the convolutions of the "crown"
knot, which had come in the cord at our last
séance (see page 240), held three days previously,
and which had much occupied my mind. On
the left focussing glass was a mark with yellow
chalk, which might be taken for a Greek
“ M,"
the strokes -}-in. high (Fig. 305). The quarter
plates had been numbered by me at home, the
ﬁrst pair, 730 (on the left) and 731 (on the right),
the second 732 (left) and 733 (right). I
took them away with me; see p. 56 for an 0
interesting result. Greek M suggested by me. F:g- 3°5
August 11th, 1925.—-Mrs. Deane had been taking a fortnight's rest from all
psychic work. She looked stout and well, but complained of sleeping very
badly; suggests’ her power is ebbing; too much taken out of her; had some
photograph sitters; got nothing and gave the money back, she told me.
Weather mild and sunny. Light per window (ruby) in the dark-room good.
Head-band, breast-paper. During the ﬁrst and second experiments a piece of
citrate of iron paper under Mrs. Deane's nude feet placed on board ; my black
cloth over knees and shins.
Mental suggestion to-day, Greek

"
and English letter "A."
(141) As I had slipped out Greek "A," though Mrs. Deane stated she did not
notice
it,
I
changed my mental suggestion to
a
Greek and English “E” (cursive).
I
wrote the letters down on my note card at once, before the third experiment.
I
suggested vigorously.

As regards the marks on the bichromated cartridge (third experiment), the
"F" was perfect, and as Mrs. Deane cannot see her hands on account of
the easel, she could not have placed the horizontal lower bar so accurately in
connection with the vertical line.
I
t
is
really out of the question that she could
have had any crayon or other coloured material in her hands, or touched those
I
placed in position; ﬁrstly, because of my thorough inspection of her im
prisoned hands, and, secondly, because of the efﬁciency of the stocks with
my watchfulness.
Quarter-plates developed by me the same evening; result, faint strokes.
Mrs. Deane said her head-band was struck during the sitting.
August 13th, 1925,—Weather bright; good light (ruby) in dark-room.
Mrs. Deane cheerful and bright, but complained of a headache. Head-band,
breast-paper, ferroprussiate paper under feet.
Neither of us left the dark-room during the whole sitting, 10-50 to 12-30.
(143)
A
long strip of ferroprussiate under her feet; feet outlined by
a pencil line, several other pieces of paper under the ﬁrst, feet nude, wiped on
paper by me. My black cloth all the time over Mrs. Deane's lap and shins.
Her hands could not approach her feet without my observing it. They did
not. It
is
my habit to remove the foot-paper after each experiment. On
this occasion
I
left the paper in situ during the whole sitting. At the end of
to-day's sitting, before the medium's hands were released from the stocks,
I
removed the paper. There were exceptionally large, dark-brown, undeﬁned
marks where each foot had rested, covering three-quarters of the space of each
foot on the paper. The marks did not have the appearance of having been put
on by the feet. That under the right foot
is
very large. (Fig. 308.)
Mrs. Deane said, early in the sitting, her feet were icy cold. Later on, about
the third experiment, she said her feet were abnormally hot.
I
suggested the
Greek and English letters thought
of
by me should appear large, under the feet.
(144) On account of the huge brown marks on the foot-paper, the next
morning, August 14th,
I
called
at Balls Pond Road about
8
am, as
I
wished to see whether
Mrs. Deane's feet were stained.
I
had, unfortunately, omitted to
examine them after the sitting.
One of the soles was slightly
dirty (not stained). The feet
did not look washed, but, of
course, there had been ample
time to wash them. On exam
ining the dark-room,
I
found.
on either side of the position
occupied by Mrs. Deane's chair,
a
large pool of dark liquid,
about 2l-in. X 2-in.X§-in.deep,
with regular rounded outline and
no splashings. There was no
appearance of any stream mark
from them as would have been
the case had any foot been
dipped in either.
I

Deane's big toe of either foot pm 308

could have reached the pool on its side and made a mark, but certainly
not the design which I found under the right foot. During the I} hours
sitting. it might have been done without my knowledge, but surely, with
difﬁculty, and at great risk of my detecting her action afterwards; as it was
a chance omission on my part not to examine her feet after to-day's experi
ment, due to the attention I was giving to the very large marks. Her manner
on my discovering the pools was perfectly innocent. I stained my arm and
ﬁnger with the liquid. I fancy the two pools were not alike, as one stain
was deep black and washed off like ﬁne charcoal, the other left a brown stain and
my ﬁnger tips remained deeply stained with it (red-brown). Mystery ! My view
is that the brown liquid was
“
apported"; absurd? not so, in the light of my
many results herein recorded. Had the two pools been there when I placed the
foot-paper in position by daylight, the door being open for the purpose, I should
surely have noticed them. I soaked up some of the liquid on blotting-paper and
had it analysed. The result showed it was stale amidol solution. As stated
elsewhere, it is probable that many of the marks turning to dark-brown are
made with amidol.
It was by chance that I did not remove the foot paper after each experiment
as I usually do. Had I done so I should surely have seen the pools on replacing
the paper each time, as Mrs. Deane would know.
August 18th, 1925,—“rs. Deane complained of headache.
Fourth experimenL—Hands still in stocks from the third experiment, I
slid two half-plate focussing glass screens rough sides up over the papers under
Mrs. Deane's hands. I suggested English and Greek letters; ﬁfteen minutes.
Result, indeﬁnite. large, soapy marks on both plates, which marks turned brown.
No accounting for the appearance of these marks.
August 20th, 1925,—Weather bright and warmish. Mrs. Deane in good form.
Feet nude, carefully examined and wiped by me with my clean duster
brought with me. Fer. Cit. paper with plain cartridge paper (two sheets) and
brown paper under. A spare piece of cartridge paper passed under feet
to wipe them again while Mrs. Deane's
feet were on the Fer. Cit. paper, all
on a board, and my black cloth over
her knees and shins and feet.
I remained in the dark-room the
whole time to-day. and Mrs. Deane's
hands did not go near her feet. The
result was very extensive patches.

Third experiment—Stocks, hands securely held therein. Light from window
good, also torch used. Mrs. Deane's hands never left stocks, could not, and I.
swear did not, for I observed closely all the time. Board under Mrs. Deane's
hands with a piece of Fer. Cit. paper under one hand and a piece of plain cartridge
paper under the other, two quarter-plates on easel. After Mrs. Deane's hands
were imprisoned I examined them and pressed them on a piece of plain cartridge
paper to test for marks. After imprisonment of hands I took box of crayons
from among the things I kept close to me on the shelf at my end of dark
room, and opened the lid and placed the body of the box containing

(1460) September 1st, 1925. —
Weather muggy, but turned bright.
A large piece of plain cartridge paper
was under Mrs. Deane's naked feet
during the whole time of the four
experiments. My black cloth over her
lap, down to the ﬂoor. I did not leave
the dark-room during the whole time.
Mrs. Deane's hands never went near
her feet. Her feet were examined and
wiped with my duster and rubbed on
paper before the experiment and ex
amined and rubbed on paper after the
experiment; no stain found. Result
of the experiment, reddish brown marks
quite abundant under and on the side
of the left foot, 21 pinkish kind of wash

turned browner. (Fig. 312.) Fig. 3H

she had had a hot bath. Has this anything to do with the fact that on this
occasion the results of all my experiments were nil, and there was no tapping
or other psychic effects ?
Four experiments to-day exactly as on the last occasion, no result.
( 14 7) September 8th, 1925.—Weather bright. A quantity of white light crept
into the dark-room. and the light from the ruby window was very good
Mrs. Deane in good humour. Had slept during the night. The sitting lasted
from 10-50 to 12-30. The door was not opened at all. I used my electric torch
now and again.
Mrs. Deane's feet nude; wiped by me on my own duster and rubbed on a
piece of clean paper. I placed to-day a large piece of paper under the chair
and over a piece of felt in front of the chair, I placed a. large sloping board
on the paper and on the board three pieces of paper pinned together; the
lowest a double piece of brown paper, next a piece of cartridge paper, on that
another piece of cartridge paper ; Mrs. Deane rested her feet on the top sheet.
I put my black cloth over Mrs. Deane's lap and shins ; it reached to the ﬂoor.
Mrs. Deane wore a head-band and a breast-paper. I was as watchful as ever to-day.
(148) I suggested with all to-day's experiments, the Greek letter I am
thinking of:
" L", and the English letter I am thinking of:
“
L."
(149) Third experiment Mrs. Deane's hands in the stocks. After her hands
were imprisoned they were wiped by me, by my passing the duster under them.
I then rubbed her hands on a piece of paper. I put under them a board
with two pieces of cartridge paper pinned thereon by my clerk, Miss Hurd, and
dated by her. With the board under them Mrs. Deane's hands were very
tightly held. I then placed a piece of paper on the easel, ﬁxing it by a drawing
pin, and on it two 6-in. X 4-in. Wratten "M" plates. I then chose a piece
of coloured chalk from a box which I had brought with me containing twelve
7 sahog'idoH
“608.13”
.
H 8: F EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (150) (151) Fig. 315 Page 183
colours. I chose a piece of red chalk and put it in the lid of the box, and
placed that outside the stocks between Mrs. Deane's wrists on her lap. Very
shortly Mrs. Deane began to shake all over ; legs, body and arms, as if from a
very severe attack of ague. She was quite startled and cried out “What are
they doing with me? Such a thing has never happened before." This went
on for some minutes. She said she could not stand it much longer. The
room shook with her movements. I suggested opening the door to let in the
light and stop phenomena, but Mrs. Deane did not wish that to be done. She
and I pleaded with the operators to cease. I then commanded them to do so,
and thereupon the movements ceased. One of the Wratten plates had been
thrown to the ground; the other, the left one, had been retained in position
by the pin holding the paper to the easel. After ﬁfteen minutes I removed
the board with the papers and found on one of them a scrawl in red chalk,
which may be regarded, with much imagination, as a Greek “1
"
with two Roman
"
L's." (Fig. 313, page 182). The original shows distinctly that there are three
separate strokes, as indicated in Fig. 314, page 182.
(150) Fourth experiment—I then removed the easel and left Mrs. Deane's
hands on the stocks board without the easel, therefore free. I placed a half
plate Marion Brilliant under each hand. Nothing found on them.
Mrs. Deane, during this experiment,
said she felt that if I continued these
photographic-plate experiments I should
obtain some results. She sensed the
ﬁgure
"
3
"
and suggested it meant that
at the third sitting from this I should
have success. (This prophecy was not
realised.) Nothing on the Wratten
plates. I opened the door and, watching
Mrs. Deane's hands carefully, I removed
the head-band and the paper from
under the feet.
(151) The paper under the feet had
eight nearly perfectly round circles, and
there was a similar circle of the same dia
meter on the head-band (Fig. 315). The
faults in the circle are perhaps due to
the paper not being quite ﬂat on the
board in places. Neither I nor
Mrs. Deane could account at all for the
circles nor their raison d'étnz.
Shortly thereafter, a possible clue Fig. 31 5
occurred to me. In connection with
my business I had been procuring from an engineer I deal with, little pieces or
brass with circular upstanding rims of various diameters, all about l-in. in
diameter. On the previous Saturday (the 5th) the master-mechanic I employ
called upon me and we discussed, rather warmly, the diameter of the last brass
piece made. On Monday, 7th, I had occasion to visit him for another article
he was making for me, and he showed me, from my written order, that he was
in the right. We laughed about the incident. He asked me for the pattern.
I had written to another ﬁrm, to whom I had sent it for a quotation, to return
it. While I was out at the mechanic's, the traveller of the ﬁrm (D. 8: T.)
brought the pattern back and it was placed with his ﬁrm's card in a plain
envelope by one of my clerks and given to me on my return. I left it unopened
Page 184 Par. (1510) HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS.
on my desk, where it was found in its envelope with the D. 6: T. business card
by Miss Goodwin, the clerk who tidied up my desk during my absence at
Mrs. Deane's. Miss Goodwin handed it to me the next day (Wednesday) so it
is clear I had not this piece of brass with me. The envelope was free from
creases and I know I had not put it into my pocket. I questioned Miss Goodwin
as to her ﬁnding it among the heap of papers on my desk. Now, it is a curious
thing that the ring-marks on the papers correspond in external diameter with
the diameter of the brass pieces. I can form no opinion as to the colouring
matter of the circles. They suggest lead pencil. They are greyish, and do not
suggest an inking pad for rubber stamps.
As stated, there was one similar ring on the head-paper. For comparison
the illustration shows imprints also of my brass pieces (on the right).
I would impress upon the reader how much these brass pieces had occupied
my thoughts for weeks, as I was trying to invent a new process, and it was
necessary to determine the size and shape of the brass pieces by many
experiments. I had been constantly ruminating on the subject as one does
when inventing. A very reliable foreman alone knew what I was about. The
size and shape of the rings can hardly be ascribed to coincidence.
In view of the mass of mysterious results of my experiments the rings of
this day and of October, 1928, make a very deep impression on me, forcing
on me the conviction of the presence and action of some very intelligent
invisible agency.
These ring-marks appeared a second time, most unexpectedly, during an
experiment in 1928 (see page 220), when I had commenced to occupy myself
again with the subject of the brass pieces, which matter had been left in abeyanee
by me since 1925.
Bearing in mind that many times letters and words have appeared under
Mrs. Deane's hands when I was thinking of the words or letters consciously,
it is a fair conclusion that these rings came upon the foot-paper because they
occupied my subconscious mind very prominently. This is certainly the only
explanation of the appearance of these rings.
(151a) As regards Mrs. Deane's shaking ﬁt during this experiment, the following
is of great interest. A Mr. W., a printer, was in the habit of calling upon me on
business and, knowing that I am interested in psychic research, informed me
that he had recently attended a séance for physical effects, where a bowl of ﬂour
was placed on the ﬂoor near the medium's feet with the expectation of a word
appearing in the ﬂour. He added
"
Mediums do have to put up with something.
The medium was an old lady (not Mrs. Deane), and during the experiment she
shook from head to foot." Now Mr. W; knew nothing of the experience I had
had shortly before, when Mrs. Deane trembled and shook so violently.
The following extracted from Light of March 3rd, 1928, bears upon the
same point.
Extract from the report of Signor Bozzano of sittings held at Millesimo
in Italy, without a professional medium.
"
At this moment Madame Rossi suffered from still greater nervous tension,
which became worse and worse. After my long experience of the phenomena
with apports, I well understood that this was the prelude to an apport of unusual
dimensions, for that is what we invariably noticed in our séances. Mme. Rossi
was normal and conscious, and it was therefore quite natural that she should
feel alarmed.
"In order to calm her and to give her power I took her hand; in so doing
I noticed that her arm and even her whole body were shaken by convulsive vibrations.
An apport of a long sword took place."
H 8: F EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (I52) (153) Fist-316,317 Page 185
Frank Podmore in his Modern Spiritualism (1902), Vol. II, p. 65, quotes a
report from Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace giving an account of an apport, the
medium being a Miss Nichol. He mentioned that when an apport appeared the
medium trembled violently. This was about 1866.
September 10th, 1925,—Weather bright, cold ; light (red) good. Mrs. Deane
in good humour. The sitting lasted from 10-50 to 12-35. The door was not opened
at all. I used my electric torch now and again.
Mental suggestion to-day, Greek "N" and English "N."
(152) Second experimenL—A packet of sixteen sheets of wax paper held
between Mrs. Deane's hands. I bent my head down and wrote with my ﬁnger
on my forehead over the hands holding the wax papers the Greek "N ”
and the
English letter
" N," no crackling, no noise; result, nil. During this experiment
towards the end of it I said in a sing-song manner
"
Mrs. Deane will put on the
Greek 'N' and the English letter I am thinking of," so I let, by accident, the
Greek letter slip out. I then said to Mrs. Deane, "As I have told you of the
Greek 'N' I will think of another Greek letter, and another English letter."
I then thought of
“
Mu
"
and
"
M." These latter letters did not pass my lips.
Result on wax-paper, nil.
(153) Third experimenL—Mrs. Deane's hands in stocks, board with two pieces
of cartridge paper drawing-pinned on by Miss Hurd and dated by her, put under
Mrs. Deane's hands, which were securely imprisoned ; impossible for her to have
removed them ; a piece of paper fastened on the easel. The board was pushed
under Mrs. Deane's hands after her hands were ﬁxed in stocks and after they were
ﬁxed, before introducing the board I wiped her hands with my duster and a
piece of paper. All being so ﬁxed I chose a piece of violet chalk from among
a dozen pieces, each differently coloured, contained in a box which I had brought
with me, and had kept closed away from Mrs. Deane. I took this piece and placed
it in the cardboard lid of the box and placed the lid like a tray on Mrs. Deane's
lap between her wrists. I kept up the mental suggestion, Greek
“
N
"
or
" M
"
or English "N" or "M." There was some noise, such as scraping on the
paper. I put my head down close
to the board to aid suggestion, ﬁfteen
minutes. I then removed the two
quarter-plates (Wratten M) which
I had placed on the easel after
placing chalk in position and put
them away. Result, on left paper
a violet
“
S” and on the right paper
a double mark in violet chalk crayon,
one part of which is an undoubted
Greek
“
N," the other a deﬁnite
attempt at a Greek
“
M," both were
written upside down as regards
Mrs. Deane (excellent
!).
Impossible
for Mrs. Deane to have known
which crayon
I
was going to choose.
I
did not know myself until
I
chose it. These came from
a
dozen pieces
lying side by side in my own box of twelve different colours; impossible for
Mrs. Deane to draw
a
hand out of the locked stocks
;
had
it
been possible
I
could
not have avoided detecting the action, having acute hearing, and as the light
from the ruby window was good to-day and
I
had my electric torch at hand,
which
I
used once or twice. During this experiment Mrs. Deane's right arm
ached as
it
had done before. (Figs. 316 and 317.)
Page 186 Pars. (154) (155) HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS.
September 15th, 1925,—Weather bright. Dark-room very bright. Door
not opened after commencement—I0-50 to 12-30. Mrs. Deane in good spirits,
though she complained of a headache.
The letters I thought of to-day were the Greek
"
Pi (n)
"
and the English
"
P." I also suggested Hulah's photograph should come on the photographic
plates, and I suggested Mr.
“
S
"
should put his name on the papers.
First experimenL—Twenty minutes. Hands, each in an envelope containing
cartridge paper, envelopes tied to wrists ; result, no noise, nil.
Second experimenL—Wax paper between Mrs. Deane's hands, about sixteen
sheets, ﬁfteen minutes ; no noise at all ; result, nil.
Third experimenL—Stocks very securely locked with the clips, impossible
for Mrs. Deane to remove a hand. Besides, I was quite close to her and had
my electric torch in operation now and again, though quite unnecessary. After
hands locked I placed board with papers already pinned on it under her hands,
then I chose a piece of blue chalk out of a box of twelve colours. I placed,
and pinned, a piece of cartridge paper on easel, and placed thereon two Wratten
“ M
"
plates over the paper, and I put the blue chalk in a box lid and placed the lid
between Mrs. Deane's wrists on her lap. After ﬁfteen minutes I removed the
board with the papers, leaving Mrs. Deane's hands in the stocks. Result on
one of the papers, an
“
S
"
in blue chalk, IQ-in. high. I removed the Wratten
plates.
Fourth experimenL—I placed a plain board under Mrs. Deane's hands and
then a marked half-plate Marion, blue label, under each hand. I then replaced
the Wratten plates on the easel. I had brought all these with me. I suggested
we should get an Extra on one of the plates. This Mrs. Deane also desired
very much. I besought the control to effect this, and also asserted the control
would do it. Mrs. Deane was very favourably impressed (wrongly, as it turned
out) that we should get something on these plates if I continued using them.
I developed to-day's at home the same evening. Nothing on any of the four
plates.
There was a foot-paper, Mrs. Deane's feet being on it the whole time, with
her stockings on ; result, nil. Head-paper, breast-paper, results, nil. Mrs. Deane
thinks her powers are failing. She gets little, she says, at Miss Stead's, and the
Extras there are now very small. Her early Extras had voluminous surrounds.
September 17th, 1925.—Weather bright; dark-room very light. Mrs. Deane
in good form, but complained of being very tired. She said a sitting with me
took far more out of her than her ordinary photographic sittings.
(154) The suggestions throughout to-day's experiments were the Greek letter
I am thinking of,
“
Pi," and the English letter I am thinking
of,
" P." As the
word "Pi" slipped out of my mouth in the second experiment,
I
added, in
my thoughts, the Greek letter "Sigma."
I
found that Mrs. Deane had not
noticed my slip of the letter "Pi." In any case Mrs. Deane would not know
the Greek
“
Pi."
(155) Second experimenL—Mrs. Deane's hands put into stocks. The easel was
clipped down immovable.
I
then placed a board, with two pieces of clean cart
ridge paper pinned thereon, under her hands. It required a little pressure to force
it
past the thick part of the hand near the wrist. This shows how tightly her
hands are held in the stocks. She showed me, after the sitting, the red marks
made by the arches of the easel on her wrists. Mrs. Deane sat for about one
hour with her hands in the stocks for experiments.
I
had pinned
a
piece of
paper on the easel. On this paper
I
placed two dated Wratten
“
M" plates,
5-in.X4-in., side by side. These plates remained on the easel until close to
the end of the fourth experiment.
It
is
to be noted that any attempt made by
HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS. Figs. 318 to 321 Page 187
Mrs. Deane to wriggle her hands out
of the stocks would have dislodged one
or both of these plates, for 0they were
not fastened in any way. After the
Wratten plates were put in position
I put a box lid between Mrs. Deane's
wrists on her lap, containing a piece of
red chalk. This colour I had chosen
out of a dozen different colours. \
Mrs. Deane was not informed of the "k
colour. Before placing the board, with
the papers, under Mrs. Deane's hands,
I rubbed under her hands a clean piece
of cartridge paper. I examined her
hands by the bright light Of the ruby Fig. 318 Fig. 319
window and rubbed
them on the paper.
This experiment lasted
ﬁfteen minutes. lkept . *
suggesting as above (I
recorded. During this
experiment there were
deﬁnite noises, as of
tapping and writing.
Mrs. Deane and I have V
noticed that, as soon as
we call one another's
attention to such a noise,
it ceases.
On one paper 0I _ _
found a mark (Fig. 318)
mg. 32° FIS- 31I
in red chalk ; on the other a mark (Fig. 320), also in red chalk. A piece of red
chalk was in the box lid, as mentioned above.
As regards these marks in red chalk, it seems to me that the mark (Fig. 318)
may represent a
“
P," such as might be written by a person under difficulties.
Some persons write a capital “P,” as shown in Fig. 319, which is the same as
Fig. 318, with the line slightly adjusted. Why should the mark be at all of such
a nature ?
As regards the second mark it is clear that a cursive "Pi" is intended.
Fig. 321 shows the mark as slightly adjusted. I would point out that a cursive
"
Pi
"
is not to be found in dictionaries or many Greek grammars or books.
The following is extracted from a letter written to me by a friend familiar with
Greek, concerning a cursive
“
Pi." -

September 22nd, 1925.—Weather bright; Mrs. Deane very tired, as she
always is the day after a séance.
Mental suggestion throughout to-day, the Greek letter "Delta" and the
English letter
"
D."
(1554) Second experimenL—Mrs. Deane's hands in stocks; in addition, a band
of brown paper painted luminous, placed on the top of the backs of her
hands and pinned down on either side. After imprisoning Mrs. Deane's hands
in this way, I placed a board with two pieces of plain cartridge paper pinned on
it, dated, under her two hands. I then placed two 5-in. X 4-in. photo
graphic plates on the easel and then a piece of plain cartridge paper under the
two plates, and then I put a piece of coloured chalk in the lid of a box, and
placed the lid on Mrs. Deane's lap between her wrists. After ﬁfteen minutes I
removed the board and found one of the papers bore a chalk mark somewhat like
a large
“
S." The luminous band certainly prevented Mrs. Deane writing this.
September 24th, 1925.—Weather bright; Mrs. Deane in good form, but
complained of feeling tired through want of sleep. She undertakes too much,
especially on account of her many dogs.
Mrs. Deane took off her shoes and sat in woollen stockings. She washed
her hands in water in my presence, and dried them on a clean duster I had
brought with me. I did not open the door from the commencement to the
end of the proceedings (10-50 to 12-30).
I placed a large piece of plain cartridge paper, 20-in. X 20-in., under the
chair and under the board, on which I had pinned another piece of plain cartridge
paper, 2-ft. X l-ft. Under this was a piece of brown paper. Mrs. Deane
placed her feet on the top paper and I outlined them withpencil. Stockinged
feet rubbed on a separate clean piece of plain cartridge paper before proceedings
started. No marking on it at all. I put my black cloth over Mrs. Deane's
knees and shins. It is large and reached down to the ground.
Head-paper and breast-paper.
To-day I suggested mentally all the time, from the very beginning, the letters
I was thinking of, namely the Greek letter
“
N
"
and the English letter
“
N."
Second experimenL—I sat down on the bottom of a milk case, so that my
head was not far above Mrs. Deane's lap. I placed my electric torch. with light on,
on the middle shelf so that her lap was well illuminated. I put a piece
of plain cartridge paper on my bald head and Mrs. Deane placed her hands on the
paper, with instructions from me not to remove either without my permission.
The idea was to assist my mental suggestion reaching her hands. She did not
remove either of them during the whole experiment, which lasted about ten
minutes. Mrs. Deane's elbows were resting on a board on her lap. My head
was low down. After her hands came on my head, and while my
torch was shining on the neighbourhood about Mrs. Deane's lap, I placed the
lid of the chalk box, with a piece of red chalk chosen from twelve colours, on
the board on her lap where I could see it. I had put the date with it
on the inside of the box so there should be no mistake. I removed the paper
from under Mrs. Deane's hands ; it bore three marks in red chalk, one of which
was decidedly moist.
Third experimenL—I put Mrs. Deane's hands in the stocks, fastened them
with the clips, put a band of brown paper, 2-in. wide, with its upper surface
painted with luminous paint over the backs of her hands, pinned the ends down
on either side. Then I put0on the easel two 5 X4 Wratten
"
M
"
plates, and then
slid a piece of cartridge paper under them. I then, and not till then, placed on
her lap, between her wrists, the lid of the chalk box containing a piece
of violet chalk. Under her hands I put two plain papers ﬁxed on a board.
H 8: F EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (15517) to (1560) Fig. 322 Page 189
On this occasion Mrs. Dea0ne began to shake as with severe ague, as on a
previous occasion, but not so severely. The left leg was not shaken, but the
right one and the whole body. She stated her toes remained unmoved from their
original position. She and I requested the controls to cease. The shaking did
not last long. The photographic plates (Wratten
"
M") on easel were not
disturbed. There was a good deal of tapping and of noise, as of writing, during
this experiment. Result, some violet marks on both pieces of cartridge paper.
I removed the board with the two pieces of cartridge paper and put it on one side.
(1551;) Fourth experiment—Mrs. Deane's hands not moved from the stocks. I
replaced the board by two half-plates (Marion Brilliant, I had brought with me),
one under each hand. These rested on the stocks base. By this action I had
loosened the brown paper band with upper surface painted with luminous
paint. I tightened it and pinned it down. The easel paper with the two
Wratten
"
M
"
plates were left in position. After ﬁfteen minutes I ﬁrst removed
the paper under the Wratten plates, then the Wratten plates and put them away,
then the two Marion plates, then I opened the door, removed the head-band,
then the foot-paper, and, lastly, I released Mrs. Deane's hands from the stocks.
The interesting results on the photographic plates are given on page 57,
as they are unexposed plate results (Us).
The foot-paper was very much covered with red chalk marking, mostly
under the right foot; there was some red chalk marking under the left foot.
It was the right leg which was most shaken. Before Mrs. Deane left her chair
in the dark-room I got her to rub her stockinged feet on a piece of clean cartridge
paper ; no marking, red or other, was produced.
The head-band had a red chalk mark, just a thick stroke ; the breast-paper
had a red chalk mark. The chalk marks on the cartridge paper under the
right foot were heavy and broad, as if done with the side of the piece of red
chalk, and not the end. It will be remembered red chalk was chosen by me
for my second experiment to-day.
Oetober 6th, 1925,—Weather ﬁne. Mrs. Deane complaisant.
To-day's suggestion, the Greek letter
“
D
"
and the English cursive letter
“

(156) First experimenL—A packet of sixteen sheets of wax-paper between
Mrs. Deane's hands; about twenty minutes ; result, a faint blackish mark like
a broad

on an inside sheet, and while nothing was seen on page one
(i.e., the page under Mrs. Deane's
right hand) next day, at my OITICC,
F
a bold, broad 2-in. long, was
found on it, of a faint brown—which
turned darker. - "

There was nothing on the ﬂoor of the dark-room at the commencement
of the sitting. At the close of the sitting I found a very small handkerchief,
10-in. X 9-in., with circles very similar to those of the foot-paper of September
6th sitting. No one in the house recognised the handkerchief. It is curious
that the handkerchief should have circles, reminding one so forcibly of the rings
which appeared in such a mysterious manner on the foot-paper, as described
in the report of September 8th last (Fig. 322 X } about).
October 8th, 1925,—Weather cold and dull. Sun came out. Mrs. Deane
had had a fair night, but complained of headache. She was in complaisant
humour.
At the commencement we were disturbed by Miss L. Deane speaking to
her mother through the door, and saying a visitor was waiting.
Second experimenL—Mrs. Deane dipped her hands in water and wiped them
on my clean duster. My black cloth on her lap. New tape-stocks with easel (see
page 108). Hands absolutely secure, tape tight over them, more comfortable
than in the previous wooden easel locking apparatus. After imprisoning
her hands I put the easel in- position with a piece of cartridge paper
pinned on it. I placed under Mrs. Deane's hands a board with two pieces of
cartridge paper, pinned on it by Miss Hurd, all brought with me. I chose out
of a dozen oolours a violet piece of chalk and placed it in the left (of Mrs. Deane)
channel, and a piece of red chalk in the channel under her right wrist.
Mrs. Deane had a shaking ﬁt as before, but not so severe. Result, a violet
chalk
“
S
"
on left paper and a violet chalk
“
E
”
on right paper. I had been
suggesting the Greek and English letters I was thinking o_f(viz. :
"
D
"
and
“
D "),
or the object I was thinking of (viz. 1 a funnel). The trough is straight-sided.
and under the conditions, it was impossible for Mrs. Deane to have removed
the chalk without certain detection by me, and she did not know which I should
choose out of the twelve colours.
Third experimenL—Hands not freed, board with papers removed. Two
half-plate Marion Brilliant substituted for board under Mrs. Deane's hands;
ﬁfteen minutes. Easel left as before, with same paper on it.
Fourth experiment—Hands not freed from the stocks. Two fresh half-plates
put in place of previous ones ; ﬁfteen minutes. No Wratten plates placed on
easel at all to-day. Mrs. Deane tells me she never got any Extra on panchromatic
plates, though trials have been made.
The four plates developed by me the same evening at my chambers ; result,
a slight mark (l-in. Xﬁ-in.) on one of them ; very faint ; it came out rather late.
October 13th, 1925.—Weather not very light. Mrs. Deane complained of
having passed a very bad night, also of some headache.
I had just been re-reading Mr. Bulford's experiments in psychic photography,
and noticed his circle sat quiet for ten minutes. I therefore to-day adopted the
same rule and enjoined silence.
By means of a little paste on one corner I ﬁxed a brown paper triangle on
the ruby glass window and asked Mrs. Deane to look at
it,
and told her
I
wanted
triangles on my papers, etc.
Head-band, breast-paper, paper under booted feet; my black cloth over
her lap right down to ﬂoor.
(15

Second experimenL—Hands securely ﬁxed in tape-stocks; then hands wiped
with my duster and pressed on
a
piece of paper by me
;
paper rubbed backwards
and forwards under Mrs. Deane's hands. Hands washed before this experiment
by dipping in basin of water in the dark-room and wiping on my clean duster
;
nails examined, very short; then board with two sheets of cartridge paper
placed under her hands, then easel with
a
piece of cartridge paper pinned
on it, put into position. Then, and not till then, did
I
put crayons, one
red and one violet, colours unknown to Mrs. Deane, out of
a
box of twelve

colours, one in each half of the gutter, the red on Mrs. Deane's left side, the violet
on Mrs. Deane's right. The easel was ﬁxed by the central pin only. The
ends were fairly free, allowing a circular movement of a full half-inch, measured
at the extremities, until the side wings touched the bridge or roof. There was a
little shaking and trembling of Mrs. Deane's body during this experiment;
ﬁfteen minutes. Before inserting the chalks I marked each piece of paper at
the corner "left
"
for the corres
ponding channel.
(I always did this
thenceforward.)

Query
:
Those marks, being so weak, were they produced from the chalk mark
put on at the corner of each paper?
I
removed the easel with its paper and
found a mark in red chalk, calling to mind the suggested triangle (Fig. 323).
It extended far beyond the central pin on the left, and one would expect to see
a
break in the line. had
a
hand pressed the chalk on the paper, as the pressure
would have caused the easel to swing over to the right
;
but there
is
no break.
I
found the chalks in the gutter at the end of the sitting.
I
discovered that with persistent effort and much “wangling” Mrs. Deane
could, in the daylight, with her hands free, extract the longer piece (the red)
by means of her little ﬁnger, but not the other
;
under the conditions imposed
this could,
of
course, not be done, certainly not without my knowledge.
Third experimenL—I then tried a new experiment.
I
freed Mrs. Deane's
hands and placed under them
a
papier-maché developing dish with two half-
plates (Marion Brilliant) and poured some dilute Rodinal over them (one in forty)
sufﬁcient to cover them. She placed her hands over them, resting her ﬁngers
on
a
piece of wood in the dish, ﬁfteen minutes. No result.
Fourth experimenL—I then placed two further plates in the dish and after
Mrs. Deane had held her hands over these for ﬁve minutes
I
poured the Rodinal
away, and got Mrs. Deane to hold her hands over the plates for
a
further ten
minutes, letting her ﬁngers rest upon the plates; result, very slight marks on
each of
a
scratchy nature.
I
found
a
violet streak on the head-band.
(158)
I
removed the foot-paper. Mrs. Deane had wiped her thin-soled indoor
boots on my clean paper before sitting down.
I
found
a
red chalk scrawl, a bad
"
S." 3-in. X ll-in., near and partly under the right heel. Mrs. Deane could
not have done this without my seeing her action. Her hands never went below
her lap.
I
was in the room the whole time. There was
a
full-sized sheet of
cartridge paper, brought by me, placed on the ﬂoor under her chair and feet
;
she stood on that after the experiment and there was no red mark made by her
boots on it. .
Page 192 Fig. 324 Pars. (158:!) (159) H 51 F EXPERIMENTS
October 22nd, 1925,—Weather very bad all this week. Air saturated with

(the term he used) when atmosphere is moisture-laden. Andrew
said the same at my yesterday's sitting with the Misses Moore.
No results at all, although there were various sounds of tapping and of
writing, and Mrs. Deane's right arm positively hurt her, higher up than before,
and on one occasion Mrs. Deane stated she felt a distinct hand lift her left hand
from the paper
November 5th, 1925,—Weather damp and dull. A more or less silent

Head-paper, breast-paper, paper under boots. No result with any of these
except breast-paper, for which see below.
Second experimenL-—Tape-stocks used. I had brought with me in a small
glass tube a piece of red pastel moistened with carmine and glycerine. I placed
this in the left hand channel; the idea being to see, should a mark come,
whether Mrs. Deane's ﬁngers were stained. In addition to suggesting the
above-mentioned letters mentally, I said aloud,
“
Or put

or

"
ln
the other channel I put a piece of dry, light-blue pastel. Two pieces of plain paper
pinned on loose board placed under Mrs. Deane's hands after usual examination
and wiping of hands. The easel was in position with a piece of plain paper
pinned to
it,
and two quarter-plates resting on the
ledge. Mrs. Deane told me that
a
pin had become
loose at the end of the tape securing the left-hand
;
I
found the tape in position and the pin only just
loose.
I
reﬁxed it. This does not affect the result
one iota. Results

(159) Fourth experimenL—Hands still imprisoned; easel, etc.,as before. Two
dry half-plates (Marion Brilliant) placed under Mrs. Deane's hands. Each of
the above experiments lasted about ﬁfteen minutes. The four plates were
developed by me at home. Nothing on them. As regards the quarter-plates
(see above) Mrs. D. had no chance of touching them. On November 8th
I
found
an "S" on one of these quarter-plates about ll-in. long. It seems to
be made of small particles of dust and the emulsion does not appear to be
affected.
It
is
an undoubted "S."
I
had not removed the plate from my
rooms.
It
was drying on my bookcase.
I
re-washed

and the "S" showed
distinctly, when wet, which
it
did not do on ﬁrstwashing. nor when previously
examined dry.
It
looks as
if
it
came on at my rooms.

The conclusion I have come to about this "S" is that it was written (but
not by Mrs. Deane, this was impossible under the conditions) by a smear of the
glycerine I had put on the chalk, which glycerine rendered the gelatine of the
plate moist in a portion about ll-in. long in the shape of an
“
S
"
which ﬁxed
the dust from the air in that portion of the plate. I have not, however,
managed to imitate the effect by means of glycerine.

in very faint green. I could not match this colour with any of
the chalks in the pastel box. I examined Mrs. Deane's ﬁngers and found no
stain upon them. I found I could handle the damp red pastel without staining
my ﬁngers. The damp carmine seemed to have been absorbed by the chalk.
During the second experiment, Mrs. Deane complained of the pain in her
arm which she had had before. She stated that during this experiment her right
hand was touched by two ﬁngers. She asked me if I had touched her. (No.) She
thought I had done so because the ﬁngers felt so real. The easel prevents her
seeing her hands.
November 121h, 1925,—Weather very bright. Mrs. Deane well, but some
what
“
grumpy." Mrs. Deane was disappointed at the Cenotaph results
yesterday. The plates for that day were bought at a shop and appear to
have been stale.
(1604) Second experimenL—Mrs. Deane's hands were fastened down by tapes
in the tape-stocks. I had omitted to put the easel in my bag. To replace the
easel, I put the lid of a large cardboard box, measuring 12-in. X9l-in., upside
down over Mrs. Deane's hands, that is, resting on the backs of her
hands. On the top of this lid, that is to say, on the inside of the lid, now upper
most, I put a piece of cartridge paper ﬂat, measuring 9l-in. X 9-in. On this
I put two quarter-plates. Mrs. Deane's hands were resting upon a piece of
paper pinned on the base of the stocks. I inserted a piece of wetted red pastel
in the left-hand channel, and a piece of dry pastel also. In the right channel
I put a piece of wet violet pastel and a piece of dry violet pastel. I suggested
to-day, openly, an octagon, and reinforced the suggestion by means of a brown
paper slip, }-in. wide, in the shape of an octagon, placed on window. My
menial suggestion was my grandmother (Ann), my mother (Ellen), and aunt
(Annie) ; all deceased. I did not think of their names, as a matter of fact ;
ﬁfteen minutes.
Third experiment—Hands not removed from the stocks. also box lid left
lying on the hands and quarter-plates, and the two papers left under the hands.
Four/h experiment—Hands not removed from
stocks ; box lid and quarter-plate left as before. Two
photographic plates, half-plate size, placed under the
hands instead of paper.

complained of the same, and then said

Dgcember 101b, 1925.—Weather fairly bright; Mrs. Deane in very good
humour.
My mental suggestion to-day was the letter
“
N
”
in connection with my sister
Nellie, lately deceased.
There were four experiments to-day, during which Mrs. Deane had her
hands imprisoned continuously in the tape-stocks.
First experimenL—A piece of paper on the easel
;
hands wiped after
imprisoning and rubbed on a piece of clean paper as usual.
A
board, with two
pieces of paper pinned on it, placed under Mrs. Deane's hands.

a

an
"

"
;
nothing on the right piece of paper
;

(164) Second, third, and fourth experiments.—These were all alike and consisted
in placing under Mrs. Deane's hands, for ﬁfteen minutes, a pair of quarter-plates
(Marion Brilliant), that
is
to say, six plates in all. On developing these six
plates nothing was found on any one of them, not even ﬁnger-marks.

with two pieces of cartridge paper pinned on it (which board and my duster and
everything used, I brought with me) under Mrs. Deane's hands. I then chose a
red chalk for left channel, ﬁrst marking the left paper with it, and a blue and a
violet piece for the right channel, marking the right paper with each. We sat
for twenty-minutes.
Easel in position with paper on it. Sound of writing. Some distinct taps
to-day in dark-room. Mrs. Deane said she saw a light. She sang the hymn
“
Abide with me." I asked for letter I was thinking of (“ N
"
for Nelly). Result :
Nothing on easel-paper; On left-hand paper, nothing; On right-hand paper,
written with red chalk, was the word
"
Rent
"
(the
“
R
"
an uncertain
“
R," and very smudged) and a capital "A" under it.
Second and third experiments.—These were alike and with no result. Quarter
plates Marion Brilliant dipped in Rodinal solution, I in 50, and one was placed
in a tinned copper shallow pan under Mrs. Deane's right hand, and the other
in a shallow pan—zinc—under Mrs. Deane's left hand, for ﬁfteen minutes.
The plates were then put into the Rodinal solution in a large china dish. Nothing
coming on the quarter-plates in the metal pans, I put the plates side by side,
without the pans, after dipping them in the weak Rodinal solution, and
Mrs. Deane placed her hands, still in the stocks, pretty ﬂat upon them; still
no result.
During these experiments there was a sound of writing, so I expected to see
writing on the easel, or other papers, but no, nothing. Paper on easel during
these two experiments.
Fourth experimenL—Two dry, Marion Brilliant, quarter-plates put back
to back, held between Mrs. Deane's hands for ﬁfteen minutes, and then developed
by her in the Rodinal solution, which I had strengthened. Result : The left
hand plate showed a weak cloudy mark ; nothing on the other.
December 313t, 1925, — Mcnlal suggestion to
day," Bruce," the name of the dog which bit Mrs. Deane.
First experimenL—Hands in tape-stocks, paper
under hands, two quarter-plates on easel.
Second experimenL—Hands still in stocks, two
quarter-plates under hands.
Third experimenL—Paper on easel and paper under
hands, with chalks in channels.
Results: A long zig-zagged line, 2-in.Xl}-in.. in
blue chalk on the easel paper. On paper under the
right hand, a poor "B" (for
“
Bruce" ?), 2-in. X l-in.,
in blue chalk (Fig. 327). Nothing on the quarter-plates.

double-frame. For illustration and description of
this see page 109. I took with me two picture frames, I
of the same size, measuring 10-in.X9-in. outside, and F:g- 327
8-in.X7-in. inside, each framing a piece of thick, white cardboard measuring
8l-in.XH-in. The frames were fastened together, and kept é-in. apart by
means of a cork glued on at each corner. (After to-day's experiments I
reduced the distance between the frames to %-in.) The cards were not ﬁxed in
the frames, but the pressure of Mrs. Deane's hands held them in position. After
to-day's experiment I ﬁxed them always in the frames by means of drawing pins,
as one of the cards slipped a bit and gave an opening. It was replaced
immediately. This slipping could not have affected the result, as I was standing
Page 196 Figs. 328, 329 Pars. (166) to (168) H & F EXPERIMENTS.
over Mrs. Deane, and the ruby window let in a fair amount of light, sufﬁcient
for me to notice any movement, which would have been necessary for her
to make any marks on the inside of the cardboard. It is obvious that a good
deal of action would be necessary to place a deﬁnite mark in the centre of the
cardboard inside.
After Mrs. Deane's hands were imprisoned by means of the tapes, one on
one side and one on the other of this double frame apparatus, I chose a piece of
blue chalk and slipped it in between the frames. This piece of chalk rolled out
and fell to the ﬂoor on account of the frames being bevelled. (After this experi
ment I made the edges of the frames square.) I put another piece of chalk
between the frames, violet in colour, and this remained in position between the
cards. I suggested to Mrs. Deane that she should put the letter or object I
was thinking of on the cardboard.
Mrs. Deane had a head-band on, a piece
of paper on her breast, and a piece of paper
under her feet, and my black cloth had been \
l
l
placed by me over her lap and legs.
(166) The duration of the ﬁrst experiment
was half an hour; result, on the inner
surface of the lower card, well inside the card,
was a mark in violet chalk, which might . tI '
be taken for an "N" reversed (Fig. 328), C, .0
and on the other cardboard a violet chalk
"
mark somewhat like a
“
C," Z-in. high.
That anything should appear in violet chalk Cm f'‘'“‘
on an inner surface of the cards, under the
conditions, is extraordinary. '70'16 L ‘IN-“.1

breast-paper an "N" written in violet

draw the paper from her breast without my knowledge. The paper measures 9}-in.
X6-in. and it is quite a business for Mrs. Deane to tuck it in under her dress
(longways across) using her two hands. The
“
N
"
was a mental suggestion,
not uttered.
(168) January 12th, 1926,—J was accompanied by Mr. E. C. Palmer, of the
Editorial Department of the Daily News. I took my usual equipment. A very
bright day. Mr. Palmer took my place and stood all the time opposite
Mrs. Deane. I thoroughly examined the room. Mr. Palmer did so at my
request. I gave him the torch with a new battery, and impressed upon him to

it,
but, much to my chagrin, he did not do so (see printed report below),
for this somewhat spoilt his evidence.
I
explained all the apparatus to him,
and showed him the papers and
a
pile of the wax-paper.
I
opened the door
after each experiment. Mental suggestion P.
Head-paper, breast-paper, foot-paper put in position.
First experiment—Double frame, with two new cardboards, was used.
A
piece of violet chalk put inside
;
ﬁfteen minutes. no result.
(1684) Second experimenL—Mr. Palmer opened the door of the dark-room and
1
put Mrs. Deane's hands in the tape-stocks and pinned them down securely.
Mr. Palmer saw that
it
was impossible for Mrs. Deane to remove her hands from
the stocks without detection. After her hands were locked in the stocks
I
examined them, wiped them and rubbed them with
a
piece of plain paper as
I
usually do. Board, with two pieces of plain cartridge paper pinned thereon,
placed under Mrs. Deane's hands. Easel, with
a
piece of paper pinned thereon
put in position. Red chalk put in left channel, blue chalk in right-hand
channel. The box, with the remainder of the coloured chalks,
I
put near
Mr. Palmer, on the top shelf, open.
I
then shut the door. As Mrs. Deane's
hands were locked securely in the stocks and the day was so very bright,
I
(exceptionally) covered the ruby window in order to prevent phenomena being
barred by the inhibitive action of too much light. Mr. Palmer had my electric
torch, the slightest pressure on which would have produced
a
light. Thus
Mrs. Deane knew that the slightest movement on her part would have been
detected instantly. She sat quiet and chatted. Mr. Palmer's printed statement
says
:
“
I
failed to notice any suspicious movements on her part." [Is
it
con
ceivable that Mrs. Deane could have removed her hands from the stocks, executed
the markings which appeared in the third experiment, and re-pinned her hands
(an impossible feat) without making
a
stir? No
!]
After ﬁfteen minutes
I
opened the door and there was no result anywhere.

(Fig. 330, page 197). Everything removed while Mrs. Deane's hands were still
imprisoned. Nothing on foot-paper, head-paper, or breast-paper. Mrs. Deane
had her shoes or boots on.
‘Mr. Palmer expressed himself as satisﬁed that he could not explain how
the marks came, and wrote an article about it in the Daily News, which appeared
the next day.
I took Mr. Palmer upstairs and introduced him to Mr. and Mrs. Robson, who
veriﬁed my statement that they had known Mrs. Deane intimately for four
years, living in the same house with her. They conﬁrmed their esteem for
her as a perfectly honest woman.
Mr. E. C. Palmer signed a report of the sitting for me. similar to the one I
have here made.
It is curious to note that at a sitting next day which Mr. Palmer had with
the medium Mrs. Cooper, Mrs. Cooper could obtain nothing much but the letter
“
P," which was evidently impressed upon the subconsciousness of Mr. Palmer
from the above sitting with Mrs. Deane, when
"
P
"
was our mental suggestion.
January Zlst. 1926,—Weather dull. Mrs. Deane complained of a bad
headache. Head-paper, foot-paper, breast-paper in position. My black cloth
over Mrs. Deane's lap and legs ; time 1l-0 to 12-30. Dark-room door not opened
during to-day's experiments.
(169) To-day I placed a card, printed in large type "1926," before Mrs.
Deane, and suggested that that number should come on the cards or papers, or the
letter I was thinking of, namely
“
N," for Nell, or Nellie (the name of my recently
deceased sister). I am certain neither the
“
N
"
nor any indication of the thought
passed my lips. I suggested that I should like the complete word rather than
the letter only, or a sentence.
(170) Second experimenL—Hands fastened in tape-stocks. After imprisoning
the hands, easel, with paper pinned on it, 0placed in position; then board, with
two pieces of cartridge paper pinned on
it,
dated, put under Mrs. Deane's hands;
then two pieces of crayon, chosen by me from my box of a dozen crayons, and
one each inserted in the right and left channels, after marking in the corner
each respective paper with its corresponding crayon. Duration of experiment
somewhat more than ﬁfteen minutes.

I
then suggested that

were there
(a

she should fetch ink from my ink-pot at my ofﬁce, and put
it
on the foot-paper,
or pour
it
over my head.
I
joked. Then
a
strange thing happened; there
was a rustling of paper, and the easel was thrown down. (On account of the length
of the pin and its sloping direction
it
is
not at all easy to remove the easel.)
I
replaced
it
and continued my joking with
"
Topsy," saying she was
“
fust
"
(the way she pronounces
"
ﬁrst "). The easel was again thrown down.
Mrs. Deane kept fairly still. Again
I
joked or chaffed "Topsy "; then the
easel was cast down with such force that Mrs. Deane gave a start and loosened
the inner drawing pins of the right hand. The pins were still in the band.
Nothing on the papers under the hands or on easel.

or Nellie. I had my electric
torch as usual.
First experimenL—The double picture frame. The open space between the
two frames is only %-in. ; it is impossible to remove any pencil or chalk from
inside, even with the little ﬁnger. I strapped Mrs. Deane's wrists, one below
and one above the pair of the frames by means of tapes and drawing pins.
After Mrs. Deane's hands were strapped down Iinserted a piece of copying-ink
pencil, 3i-in. long, and a piece of coloured chalk between the frames, so that
they rested on the lower cardboard surface. We sat for half an hour. I carried
on my suggestions. I had my electric torch at hand and used it.
Result, nothing on the top card ; a scrawl, somewhat like an
" S," 2-in. long,
on the outside of the lower card. i.e., the one on the left hand,of the same colour
as the chalk placed by me (blue) inside.
Second experiment—Tape-stocks with easel used as described so many times.
I asked "Topsy" (a child control of Mrs. Deane's) to come with ink and put
it on my head, or on the foot-paper, but there was no response or throwing
about of the easel this time.
February 9th, 1926,—Weather dull and rather chilly. My open suggestion
to-day was that Mr.
"
S
"
should put his full name on the card, or paper, and the
mental suggestion, which did not pass my lips, was
“
Bob," the name of
Mrs. Deane's elder daughter.
Mrs. Deane said she saw a blue light, and that it was a favourable sign.
At the end of the sitting she said that she had seen more lights in the room.
I had kept the dark-room very dark to-day. I had my electric torch.
Head-paper, breast-paper, and foot-paper.
First experiment—I used the double frame, as previously described.
I secured Mrs. Deane's hands with the tapes, one either side. After the
hands were secured, I chose a short piece of violet chalk and pushed it in
between the frames, and also a 3l-in. long piece of copying ink pencil. Of
course, Mrs. Deane did not know before her hands were imprisoned what I
was going to insert. I stood beside her with my red torch in good order, and she
sat thus for forty minutes while I suggested. On freeing Mrs. Deane's hands, and
in taking the frames away, the pencil and chalk fell on the ﬂoor. I examined the
cardboard. On the top piece outside, in copying-ink pencil, were the letters
" T A R," no chalk mark. I groped on the ﬂoor and found the pencil, but not
the chalk. During this experiment Mrs. Deane stated she saw a lot of lights
and felt three solid taps on her left knee. Mrs. Deane reported six touches in
all to-day.
(172) Second experimenL—I locked Mrs. Deane's hands securely in the tape
stocks. After they were imprisoned, I put the easel in position. The hole for the
pin had been deepened, so that the pin went right home. I then put the board
with two pieces of paper pinned on it, under Mrs. Deane's hands. I put a piece
of copying-ink pencil in the right-hand channel, and a piece of blue chalk in the
left-hand channel. We sat for twenty minutes. During this time I crouched
down and put my head near the easel and asked "Topsy
"
if she were there
to write on my head, or to paint on it as she had done once before. The result
of this adjuration of
"
Topsy
"
was a rustling of the paper on the easel and the
easel came out quietly, the paper touching my forehead, the easel falling on the
backs of Mrs. Deane's hands. I replaced the easeI.

mentally suggested by me? (F

(I
74) CommenL—Since Mrs. Deane and
I
went to school, children are taught
to write
a
“
b" as seen in the illustration (when writing in imitation of print).
Only recently did
I,
by chance, see one of my clerks write
a
“b" in this manner.
This "b”
(if
it
is
a
"
b
")
did not emanate, therefore, from Mrs. Deane or myself.
It
is
curious that also in the ﬁrst experiment
a
three-lettered word came.
February 16th, 1926,—Weather bright. Mrs. Deane in good humour.
Head-band, breast-paper and foot-paper in position.
I
brought a card with
me with
"
1926
"
printed large, and asked Mrs. Deane to try to put that number
on some of the papers, or for Mr.
"
S
"
to write his full name, or for the word
I
was thinking
of
to come upon the paper, or the initial letter of that word (Hurd).
(1
75) First experiment—Double-picture-frames with cardboards, as described
in full detail on page 109, and as illustrated there. Mrs. Deane's hands were
taped down, above and below. The tapes were so tight that Mrs. Deane could
hardly move her wrists. After Mrs. Deane's hands were locked,
I
inserted
between the frames
a
copying-ink pencil, 3-in. long, and a piece of coloured
chalk. We sat for half an hour thus, talking, and Mrs. Deane sang
a
hymn
and
I
made the suggestions.
I
should mention
I
had put my black cloth over
Mrs. Deane's lap and legs as usual.
The result was the ﬁgure
“
1926
"
written
backwards (Fig. 333) on the lower card- "_. . ‘
board outside, on which Mrs. Deane's left
0 '
0
’
o
hand was ﬁxed. The writing was beyond
0
7
'
Mrs. Deane's ﬁngers.
It
seems impossible
for her to have written this herself under _
0
I“:
the conditions. The writing had been done
0
with
a
pencil such as that which had been
inserted by me between the frames.
Second experiment—Without opening the V
I .
door of the dark-room,
l
substituted for the
,1‘
0
frames the tape-stocks, ﬁxing Mrs. Deane's
hands therein.
A
piece of plain paper pinned
on the easel, and two pieces of plain paper
pinned on
a
board, which board was put
0 - .~ .
under Mrs. Deane's hands
;
all this after her
hands were imprisoned.
I
then wiped her
hands with my duster and rubbed them on Fig- 333
a
clean unprinted piece of paper and
examined them.
I
then inserted
a
copying-ink pencil in the right-hand channel,
and
a
piece of red and
a
piece of blue chalk in the left-hand channel. We sat
for twenty minutes; no result.
H8: F EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (176) to (177) Fig.334 Page 201
(1 76) Third experimenL—A repetition of the
second. We sat for about twenty minutes.
Result, a single mark on the easel, like a “b,"
made with chalk of the same colour as that
put in the left-hand channel. Nothing on the
papers under the hands (Fig. 334).*
During the second and third experiments
there was a lot of scratching, as if writing was
being done with chalk, especially during
the third experiment. We have often noticed
this writing noise, and found it followed by Ibezzé
no result. I may mention here, as regards "Manama"
the second experiment, that there was a Bid-M
blackish, indeﬁnite mark on one of the
papers, under one of Mrs. Deane's hands. Fi
We found a piece of black chalk on the ﬂoor
s- 334
after the sitting. Its fractured end seemed to ﬁt a piece of similar colour
remaining in the box. It looks as if this piece had been taken from the box, made
use of on the paper under Mrs. Deane's hands, and then fallen down without
completing any deﬁnite mark. Out of the question for Mrs. Deane to gain
access to the box of chalks.
(176a) Comment—J put to Mrs. D. to-day the question of her trying the
stocks experiment with me before a body of scientists, unconnected with
psychic research. I pointed out to her the favour it would be to me by my
results being corroborated. Her reply was,
"
Oh ! That would be no good, Mr.
Warrick. If they saw the result, they would not admit it. No," she said,
"
it is all no good."
February 23rd, 1926,—Weather ﬁne, Mrs. Deane better. Head-paper,
breast-paper, foot-paper. Open suggestion, Mr.
"
S's
"
full name; mental
suggestion,
“
Peggy."
First experimenL—Double frame with cardboards, a blue pencil and blue
chalk put between the frames after Mrs. Deane's hands were taped down on
either side. Result, two indeﬁnite blue marks on the lower card outside.
(1 761,) Second experimenL—Hands taped in stocks, paper on easel, blue pencil in
right-hand channel, blue and violet chalks in left-hand channel ; twenty minutes.
Result,
"
Sa
"
on left-hand piece of paper in blue chalk.
March 2nd, 1926,—Weather ﬁne and bright. Mrs. Deane seemed well and
was cheerful. I put a head-band round her head and saw her insert a breast
paper. I put a piece of damp ferroprussiate paper under her booted feet;
I covered her lap and shins with my black cloth.
First experimenL—J gave Mrs. Deane four sheets of ferroprussiate paper to
hold between her hands. I suggested the word I was thinking of, or the ﬁrst
letter of it, or Mr.
“
S's
"
full name. The word I was thinking of was
"
Peggy."
After twentyminutes l withdrew the paper ; no results.
(177) Fourth experimenL—Tape-stocks. Having secured Mrs. Deane's hands
with two pins either side, I put a blue pencil in the right-hand channel, and
a piece of chalk in the left; the easel was in position. There were no sounds
about to-day of writing or anything. I crouched down and put my head near the
easel. The easel was forced out and fell to the ground ; this occurred seven times.
I found at my ofﬁce with my clerk, Miss Hurd, that when her arms are
imprisoned—as are Mrs. Deane 's—she can wriggle her wrists about in such a way
as to cause the easel to fall out. Such wriggling is very apparent and could
not have escaped my notice. I used my electric torch at times; besides, the
weather was bright, as noted.
* The operator may have mistaken the word I was thinking of (Hard) for bird.
Page 202 Figs. 335, 336 Par. (178) H 8: F EXPERIMENTS.
Nothing came on the papers, nothing on the easel.
On the paper under Mrs. Deane's feet I had put a piece of chalk of blue
colour. I changed this during the sitting to a piece of red chalk.
Results to-day were: Head-band, nothing; breast-paper had a broad
stroke, 2-in. X3‘/16ths-in. wide in red chalk, exactly such a mark as would be
made by the red chalk I had put on the foot-board.
I supervised the insertion and the withdrawal of the breast-paper. The box
ot chalks from which I chose the piece contained no two pieces of the same
colour.
During the sitting there were crackling noises on the breast-paper, somewhat
like taps.
March 9th, 1926.—Weather dull. During a part of the sitting it rained
hard. Mrs. Deane complained of two bad nights. She was not bright and
cheerful, and was quiet. We sang
"
Abide with me
”
and she sang two hymns
alone. I had my red torch and made use of it. Experiments to-day continuous.
Door not once opened.
(1 78) During this sitting I made a mental, not uttered, suggestion of the word
"Peggy" (which I had written in my notebook before coming), asserting we
should get it. I also asked for the full name of Mr. "S," and for good Extras
on the half-plates.
During the sitting Mrs. Deane said she felt some liquid, like a tear. running
down her face.
Head-paper, breast-paper, and foot-paper placed in position. My black cloth
placed over Mrs. Deane's lap and legs. Results found at the end of the sitting,
head-paper nil. (On March 16th I looked at this head-paper, at my office, and
found a dark, brown mark of the usual familiar character upon it, it measured
lﬁ-in.X,‘,-in.) Breast-paper, on side away from the skin, an indistinct, light,

indeﬁnite design, which turned dark brown. It
is
curious that
a
piece of the
breast-paper mark resembles
a
piece of the head-paper mark. The breast
paper measured 10-in. left to right, and Sl-in. deep
;
foot-paper, nothing worth
recording.
(179) First experiment—Double frames, as previously described; blue pencil
and crayon inserted by me after
I
had taped down Mrs. Deane's hands on the
frames; half an hour.
Result: On the top right-hand side, outside, the word "Peg gie
"
(Fig. 335,
page 202) of a light brownish colour, which turned darker. On the other side
were two marks, like
“
28
"
(Fig. 336, page 202).
Mrs. Deane's hands were securely fastened; indeed, too tightly on the left
wrist.
These marks are apparently written with some liquid
;
they have the colour
of the usual brown marks which we obtain. As regards the
"
Peggie
"
it
is
the
word of my mental suggestion (Mrs. Deane and
I
both spell
it
Peggy). As regards
the two marks which appeared on the lower cardboard,
it
would appear to be the
number “28." The following facts may (each reader must draw his own
conclusions) have something to do with the ﬁgure 28. Peggy B. resided in
California, and had, at the time, no intention of coming to England to see her
parents. In 1928 her mother was taken seriously ill (and died in that year),
and her daughter Peggy made the journey in 1928 to London to see her.
I
can
think of no other meaning of the ﬁgures
"
28." The marks appeared at the
margin of the cardboard. Maybe the 19 of 1928 missed its aim and fell outside
the frame.
(180) Second experiment—Tape¢stocks. Two pins on each side of wrists.
Mrs. Deane's hands were securely fastened
;
indeed, too tightly on the left wrist.
As my clerk, Miss Hurd, had managed, by much manmuvring (which would be
apparent to me), to cause the easel to fall on to her hands,
I
had had the horns
of the arches in the hand-stocks reduced, and the round wire of the easel replaced
by
a
rather rough square-angled (cut) nail ﬁtting very tight, and yet the easel
was thrown right over Mrs. Deane's hands without touching them, twice
;
certainly
a
supemormal effect. Mrs. Deane was particularly quiet and
motionless.
(181) Third experiment—Hands remained imprisoned in stocks and nothing
altered.
I
carefully wiped Mrs. Deane's hands and rubbed them on a piece of
paper before this experiment.
I
placed one half-plate Marion Brilliant under
Mrs. Deane's right hand, and one half-plate under her left hand, over the papers,
which remained in situ from the previous experiment
;
ﬁfteen minutes
;
result,
there was large writing on each plate. We were desiring photograph Extras.
(182) Fourth experimenL—Hands still imprisoned in stocks. The ﬁrst two
half-plates were removed by me, and two similar fresh ones put in their places
;
ﬁfteen minutes. Result, one plate had some writing, the other nothing. At
my warehouse, Mr. Tree (my assistant chemist) and
I
examined the four plates
in the dark-room, by
a
red light, and found the words
"
Peggie
"
twice, and
"Frank" once, as illustrated, written with some brown liquid of unknown
origin, but the plates were dry when
I
removed them from under Mrs. Deane's
hands. (Figs. 337, 338 and 339, page 204.)
On developing the plates at my chambers the same evening, some large,
black patches came up immediately, and
I
thought they looked like Extras;
they got weaker in the Rodinal solution, and disappeared altogether in the hypo.
The writing stood the Rodinal and Acid Hypo all right, and
is
very distinct.
(183) C0mment—The "Peggy"
I
was thinking of
is
the living daughter of
a very old friend of mine.
I
was not thinking of Frank at all. It
is
curious, how
ever, that Frank was the name of her uncle
(a
most intimate friend of mine);
killed in August, 1925, by
a
motor-bicycle. To-day's results are certainly among
Page 204 Figs. 337 to 339 HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS.
Fis- 339
As regards the unusual spelling of " Peggy". At the time Mrs. Deane said she wrote it
" Peggy". Ten years afterwards I asked her casually to write a letter for me to a friend of
mine. Idictated to hcr:—"My Dear Peggy - It is a long time, etc." She then spelt the
word " Peggy
"
not " Peggie". The Peggie is really a strange thing as also is the writing of
the letter "b" in Fig. 332, p. 200.

my best. They are fraud-proof. I am sane enough to hold the reins at the
present day of two wholesale businesses of many years' standing. I do not
seek notoriety ; I publish my results as a pleasurable duty. To observe and
record facts discovered in the front line of knowledge yields one a certain
satisfaction. My results will certainly be repeated some day. The conditions
may some day be discovered under which such effects may be produced ad lib.
March 16th, 1926.—Mrs. Deane in bright humour; weather dull.
Foot-paper, boots on; a piece of green chalk placed between the toes of
boots ; result at end of sitting, some broad green marks and some green spots.
I got Mrs. Deane to rub her right shoe (near or under which marks were seen)
on a piece of clean paper, but no stain or mark was made thereon by the sole of
the boot.
Mental suggestion to-day,
"
Iris
”
; open suggestion, Mr.
"
S's
"
full name,
and on photographic plates, good Extras.
Second, Third, and Fourth experiments.—At the commencement I blew, by
foot-bellows, into the box, referred to later, air which had passed through a
tin of calcium chloride in order to dry the air.
Second experimenL—Cardboard box with slots for wrists, lid tied on. A piece
of sepia chalk placed between Mrs. Deane's wrists which were raised on a ledge
outside the box. Result in sepia writing, “not ask so much," writing upside
down ; twenty minutes. .
Third experimenL—Two Marion Brilliant plates under hands ; no result.
Fourth experimenL—As number three, no result.
(1834) At the beginning of the second experiment there was an action on
the part of Mrs. Deane which I must record.
I heard a movement, and put my ﬂashlight on to Mrs. Deane's hands and
found Mrs. Deane's right hand half out of the box, and the chalk in the box
under her right wrist. I had put the chalk in the box lid on her lap, outside the
box. There is only one conclusion to be drawn, that Mrs. Deane had obtained
possession of it with her hand and introduced it into the box. I pointed it out to
her and she appeared to be in a dazed condition. The lesson0to be learnt from this
is the necessity of having apparatus which prevents normal action altogether.
Most of the apparatus I have employed is of that character, under the conditions
imposed by me.
This cardboard box was a temporary arrangement (the cardboard sides were
weak cardboard) for the passing over her hands of air dried by being passed
through a vessel containing chloride of calcium, which absorbs moisture.
(1831;) CommenL—When mediums produce phenomena they are in an
abnormal condition, and experience has taught the most careful, conscientious
and skilled continental psychic researchers, very highly-qualiﬁed men, many
of them medical men, who have been investigating psychic phenomena for years,
that genuine mediums will unconsciously carry out experiments in the easiest
way left open to them or their 'control', whatever that may be. This observation
on my part of Mrs. Deane's action to-day tends to prove that she could not,
during our experiments, carry out any manoeuvre of the kind without my
detecting it. I am very quick of hearing, and whenever the light from the window
is not sufﬁcient I use my red torch frequently. (See Appendix (372) p. 357.)
This box, with the holes cut for the wrist, is not to be classed with the hands
strapped on the double cardboard frames, or with the hand-stocks. Mrs. Deane's
hands were not strapped down in the box experiment.
To get the chalk out of the channels of the stocks is quite impossible under
the conditions without my observing it. The walls of the channel are upright,
not sloping, and the space between the bridge and the base is only %-in.
Page206 Figs. 340, 341 Pars.(184)to(187) H 8: F EXPERIMENTS.
March 23rd, 1926,—Mrs. Deane complained of a bad night. She said she
had been affected by the ﬂashlight of the séance the previous evening. The room
was not warm. No result to-day.
My suggestion to-day was, mentally,
“
Iris'
and an Extra on one of the half-plates.
March 30th, 1926,—Weather bright and not very cold; electric stove
introduced into the dark-room, making it uncomfortably warm. Mrs. Deane
very pleasant, but doubtless very tired, as on account of her bitch,
"
Nelly,"
whelping, she had been up all Sunday night.
Head-paper, breast-paper, and foot-paper ; results, nil.
(184) Mental suggestion (written down by me before arriving) the word“Iris."
(185) First experimenL—Double frames
with cardboards, hands wiped and taped on to
frame above and below; thereafter a piece of
Q
red chalk and a blue pencil introduced by me
l
I
; openly, Mr.
"
S's
”
full name,
between the frames. We sang and talked. .
Result, on the lower cardboard, outside,
were red strokes making
"
Ir ”
and, separately,
" Iris," the
“
Iris "
written upside down with a
reference to Mrs. Deane's ﬁngers (Fig. 340)
compare with result obtained at the next Fig-34°
sitting (April 6th). (The upper illustration
shows the word received, and, below, an interpretation of it.)
April 6th, 1926.—Bright warm day.
(186) Before setting out from my ofﬁce to-day I got Mr. Tree to whisper
into my car, while I tried to remain passive,
“
the word you will get is
'
Iris
'
or
'
Tish,'
"
in order to have this mental suggestion embedded in my subconscious
ness. I suggested to-day to Mrs. Deane that one of the words I was thinking of
should come on the cardboard, paper or glass I put under her hands.
Head-paper, breast-paper, and foot-paper all in position with usual pre
cautions. Breast-paper well inserted. Mrs. Deane had her boots on. Results,
nothing on the head-paper, nothing on the foot paper. At the end of the
sitting the breast-paper was withdrawn in my presence with some difficulty by
Mrs. Deane. A scrawl in red chalk was on it. The breast-paper measured
91-in. left to right, and 5l-in. deep. A red chalk had been chosen by me to
insert between the frames and had been removed by me.
(187) First experimenL—Double frames as previously described. Mrs. Deane's
hands taped down after examining them and wiping them with my duster,
brought with me. A piece of red chalk chosen by me out of a box of twelve
colours, and a bit of blue lead out of a lead pencil, were inserted by me between
the frames and re
moved thence by me
after the experiment;
W
twenty minutes.
Result : On the '
bottom cardboard \
outside. i.e., on that 9
above Mrs. Deane's
left hand, appeared Fig- 341
a scrawl, in red chalk, very suggestive of the word "Iris" (in fact, more suggestive
of that than anything else) (Fig. 341). Very similar to the "Iris" obtained at
the sitting of last week.
April 13th, 1926.—Weather bright ; Mrs. Deane very amiable.
Second experiment—Tape-stocks; wrists taped down; hands carefully
H & F EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (187a) (188) Fig. 342 Page 207
wiped and rubbed on paper; board with papers pinned thereon placed under
Mrs. Deane's hands.
(1874) The papers to-day ('t-in. X 5-in.) pinned on a board as usual, by Miss Hurd,
were double, with a piece of brown paper in the fold ; on the upper surface of
the lower paper was a short name written by Miss Hurd, word not known by
me, to try to obtain the writing of a word unknown to me. I had put various
short names before Miss Hurd—Tom, Bill, etc., but not Ann. I did not tell
Mrs. Deane this had been done. After putting chalk and pencil in channels,
I placed the easel bearing a piece of paper pinned on it by Miss Hurd, in position ;
it was quite blank. Early in this experiment Mrs. Deane said the tape of the
right hand was loose. She kept
her hands quite still. With thelight ~
(strong to-day) from the ruby
0
window, I removed the easel,
placed it paper upwards on the top
shelf, and inserted a second
drawing pin, to secure the tape.
I took the easel off the shelf and
was surprised to ﬁnd
“
Ann" in
i-in. high letters on it, apparently Fig. 342
written with some ﬂuid, yet it was quite dry; it must have come on in the few
seconds occupied by me in inserting the second pin and reinserting the ﬁrst, for I
should certainly have seen it on removing the easel ; it is so large and apparent.
The strokes of the letters are about }-in. and of fairly uniform thickness, of a
cafe' au Iait colour. They have not turned dark brown. (Fig. 342.)
They have the appearance of being the marks of a liquid, and yet were dry ;
ﬁfteen minutes; nothing on papers under hands.
Ann was not the word chosen by Miss Hurd.
Fourth experimenL—Two half-plates, Marion Brilliant, placed one under each
hand, above the papers on the board; ﬁfteen minutes; no visible result.
Mrs. Deane suggested I should conﬁne myself to photographic plates under
hands for three months. (I carried out this proposal with no results.)
Head-paper, breast-paper, and foot-paper to-day, nil.
April 2011;, 1926,—Weather bright and cold; no stove. Mrs. Deane was
out when I arrived. She came in downstairs, and went out again to the post.
She had been in a state of rush the whole morning, which is not conducive to
good results at our sitting. Such are the conditions under which one has to
work when the object of experimentation is a human being. There were no
results to-day at all.
First experiment—Double-frames with cardboards.
Second experiment—Tape-stocks with easel, papers under hands, chalk in
channel. Mrs. Deane stated she felt two ﬁngers warm and quite life-like,
touch one of her hands, and asked if I had touched one of her hands. (No.)
Third and Fourth experiments.—Stocks again, with half-plates under hands ;
no result.
Head-paper, breast-paper, and foot-paper; no results.
April 27th, 1926,—Weather was bright, with sun ; Mrs. Deane complained
of not having slept a wink all night, and stated she never slept after a séance.
(188) Except during photographic experimentsl kept the ruby window un
covered, and had very good light, and saw Mrs. Deane's hands in both the ﬁrst
and second experiments. The word I thought of to-day was "Tish." The word
(I learnt afterwards, at the time I was quite ignorant of
it)
written by Miss Hurd,
as described below, was
"
Ivy."
As usual my clerk, Miss Hurd, pinned the pieces of paper, each 7-in. X5-in.,
side by side. To-day the papers were l4-in.
X
5-in., folded in half, with
a
piece
Page 208 Figs. 343 to 3445 Par. (189) H & F EXPERIMENTS.
of brown paper within the fold ; on the upper surface of the lower portion of the
paper was a short name written by Miss Hurd, the word was not known by me.
This was to try to obtain the writing of a word of which I was ignorant at the
time of experiment.
Not until August 17th did I tell Mrs. Deane that a word was written on the
inside of the papers under her hands.
Head-paper, breast-paper, and foot-paper ; the lid of a box, with a piece of
chalk in
it,
was pinned down by
a
broad pin behind the heels. No result on all these.
(189) First experiment—Double frame with cardboard as previously described
;
wrists taped down, black cloth over lap and legs, excellent light
;
about ﬁfteen
minutes. There was
a
lot of very slight noises, like taps, with the pencil on the
cardboard.
I
had placed
a
piece of blue chalk and two pencils, sharpened at
both ends, between the cards.
Result on right-hand card, nil; on left card, thin blue chalk lines, which,
by mirror reading, might be read
“
Ivy" (Fig. 343) (not similar to Miss Hurd's
writing of the word
"
Ivy"); the capital "I "
being over the “V." There
was also
a
small

In the illustration the topmost print represents the scrawl as received;
the middle print shows the same reversed (as seen in
a

print shows the possible interpretation of the scrawl, as representing the word
“Ivy," none too well written. It
is
certainly strange that
a
writing should
come which can be interpreted as
"
Ivy." That the word
“
Ivy
”
was written
inside the folded paper was unknown both to Mrs. Deane and myself.
H 8: F EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (190) to (191b) Fig. 346 Page 209
(190) Second experimenL—Hands fastened in tape-stocks. Easel with a piece of
paper pinned on it. After Mrs. Deane0s hands had been taped down I placed
the board, with the papers
pinned thereon, under
Mrs. Deane's hands, and 0
I then put a piece of blue ‘I '

S, all in blue coloured
chalk (Fig. 346). The
chalks were found by me
after the experiments in
the channels. The board on which the papers were pinned closes completely the
channel on the side of Mrs. Deane's hands. Even if it did not, it is impossible
to extract the chalk from that side unobserved under the conditions prevailing.
May 1811;, 1926,—Mrs. Deane appeared normally well.
Head-paper, breast-paper, foot-paper, boots on; piece of chalk in shallow
lid behind heels ; result of these three experiments, nil.
(1904) First experiment—Cardboard in frames between hands, blue pencil
between cards; result, scribbling in blue pencil on outside surface of lower
card, blue pencil found between cards at end of experiment.
(19]) Second experiment—Mrs. Deane's hands in tape-stocks, paper on easel.
Easel ﬁts quite tightly on the board in a sloping direction away from her
(see sketch, page 108) ; the nail is a square one and rough, and it requires a certain
pull in the direction of the slope to dislodge the ease]. During the sitting I
leaned forward, so that my head should come near Mrs. Deane's, so that she might
more easily, I imagined, read my thoughts subconsciously, and thus subcon
sciously know my mental suggestion of a square. While I was leaning forward,
nearly reaching the easel with my head, the easel was jerked out, but certainly
not by Mrs. Deane ; impossible for her to do so while her hands were fastened,
without my knowledge, if at all. Results on papers, nil.
May 26th, 1926,—Weather very bright. Mrs. Deane cheerful and pleasant.
(191a) I had placed a large piece of plain cartridge paper under Mrs. Deane's
booted feet, and a piece of brown chalk in the lid of a box pinned down on
the same board on which the paper was pinned. At the end of the sitting I
noticed a mark on the paper, but it was so like the colour of possible dirt off
Mrs. Deane's boots that I did not conclude it was abnormal. On the Tuesday
following I noticed this mark standing out boldly in the form of a large
"
S,"
22-in. high, by }-in. thick, of a dark brown colour, similar in colour to so
many of Mrs. Deane's marks, which have become brown-black through
oxidation by the air. Nothing on the breast-paper.
June 7th, 1926,-Weather bright and warm.
(1911;) Second experiment—Mrs. Deane's hands fastened in stocks, and the
board, with papers pinned on it, put under her hands; a similar board, with
papers pinned on it, was put on the easel. During this experiment the board was
thrown off the easel. Under the conditions of the experiment I consider it
was impossible for Mrs. Deane to have thrown this board off the easel, without
my seeing her action, if at all. Result : On the paper under the right hand
was found a faint brown mark, the shape of a bowler hat ; under the left hand also
a faint brown mark. When seen the following week, they had turned dark brown.

Third and Fourth experiments.—Mrs. Deane held, in each case, between her
hands a pair of Marion Brilliant quarter-plates, back to back. I took the plates
away with me and developed them the same evening at home. Three of the
plates had brown marks, visible before development. The development
seems to have brought them out more, and altered them somewhat in appearance.
On two plates the marks were H-in. X 1l-in., and appeared to have been put on
with a brush, or possibly a ﬁnger. The gelatine is abraded in some places, and
the silver in some places has been protected from the action of the developer
by grease (?), but the silver has been affected in parts. The marks have ﬁne
lines along them. which remind one of a brush; it is doubtful whether the
ﬁngers would make similar marks. At intervals during these experiments Mrs.
Deane rested her hands upon a board covered with paper. At the conclusion of
the experiments I removed the board and found a faint brown mark upon the
paper on it. When seen seven days later, the mark was very dark brown.
June 15th, 1926,—Weather dull and muggy; soon became very bright,
so that light in cabinet was very good. Mental suggestion an oblong, and the
word (unknown to me) written by Miss Hurd on inside lower surface of the two
folded papers pinned on the board for the stocks ; a piece of brown paper between
each fold. Head-paper, breast-paper, foot-paper; no result on these.
First experimenL—Hands fastened on the double-cardboard frame; blue
pencil, double pointed, and red chalk inside. Mrs. Deane was very restful and
sat for about half an hour. There was a sound of writing ; nothing found on
the cardboards. If the “operator" did write, perhaps it is secret writing, and can
be brought out in some way. On removing top card the red chalk was not to
be seen. I am certain I inserted it. I could not ﬁnd it anywhere.
(191¢) Second experimenL—Stocks;
board with two folded papers pinned
on, as detailed before, under
Mrs. Deane's hands; board with
single sheets pinned on it placed on
easel. Hands securely fastened by
strong tapes tightly round the . V

HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (192) to (194) Page 211
tablets, I think it not amiss to mention the following :—I had recently received
a letter from my cousin, Mrs. Harry Warrick, from New York, that she was
about to visit England. As I am a very busy man and grudge every moment
spent away from my serious occupations, and yet wishing to fulﬁl the duty which
would devolve chieﬂy upon me of reciprocating the hospitality my cousin had
shown to me and others of our family in the States, her coming visit was
occupying my thoughts inordinately. This is a fact. Well, my cousin arrived,
and I took her about. She had brought a grandson over with her. This young
man had one word for everything he saw, and that was
"
ﬁne," with an American
accent on the "i." Now, I can imagine no more ﬁtting way of writing the word
“
ﬁne," as pronounced by an Eastern American, than the Greek
“
phi," with a
strong accent on the
" i," followed by an
"
n." It is certainly curious for the
Greek ¢ and an
“
n
"
to come so clearly if there were no meaning in them.
The interpretation of the meaning is of no real value, scientiﬁcally, but the
appearance of the marks at all, under the conditions imposed, is a matter of
real scientiﬁc importance.

Third and Fourth experiments.—Two pairs of quarter-plates, each dated by
me, placed back to back, held between Mrs. Deane's hands, which rested on a
board with papers pinned on it ; the board on her lap ; ten minutes each pair.
The black cloth (mine) was over her lap all to-day ; she had washed her hands ;
I had wiped them several times with the duster I brought with me and rubbed
them on clean paper. When Mrs. Deane replaced her hands on the board, which
was still on her lap, on my giving her the second pair of quarter-plates to hold,
she asked me if I had used any liquid, as her wrist felt some wet on the board.
I replied
"
No," and I had not been near any liquid, nor was there any about
on the shelves. At the completion of these quarter-plate experiments (ten
minutes each) the two papers on the board were found to be marked; the ,
right one with a yellowish-brownish-pinkish
" S," li-in. high
(it
became dark
brown)
;
the left one with indeﬁnite marks of
a
more pink colour, suggesting
weak blood, quite different, both of these, from the usual brown marks, but
similar to many obtained earlier in my experiments.
I
took the four quarter-plates with me and developed the plates at my
chambers. For the interesting result of this experiment see page 58.
Jung 22nd, 1926,—Weather very warm and bright.
(192) Second experimenL—Stocks with easel. The easel was thrown out from off
the base. Impossible for Mrs. Deane to have done this unseen by me,
if
at all,
while her hands were locked up and she was very quiet
;
no other result with
any of these experiments.
July 6th, 1926,—Weather very bright and warm. Mrs. Deane in good
form and agreeable.
(193) As to the four quarter-plates, upon which Mrs. Deane had rested her
hands (third and fourth experiments) for some time, nothing came upon them on
development, and they had no surface marks upon them.
(194) While Mrs. Deane had her hands in the stocks to-day (second experi
ment) the easel was quietly turned round, so that the paper faced me. As the
pin holding
it
is
a
square one,
it
is
not easy to turn the easel round; in fact,
it
cannot be done unless the easel
is
raised half an inch or so, on account of the
two horns at the extreme sides of the easel. As
I
veriﬁed afterwards,
it
would
have required prolonged effort, which
I
could not have failed to observe, and here
it
must be remembered that there
is
light from the ruby window and that
I
had my red torch frequently in action in addition.
Mrs. Deane was really much distressed at the poor results of this and the
last sitting.
I
pointed out to her, in order to soothe her, that
“
Peter Reilly
"
had come through her at
a
recent séance and said his medium required protection
Page 212 Figs. 348,349 Pars. (195) (196) H & F EXPERIMENTS.
on account of her health, and that he was going to protect her from—he used an
expression, I forget what—but I understood it to mean
"
experimentalists,"
probably alluding to me.
July 20th, 1926,—Weather bright. Mrs. Deane complained of being quite
washed-out through last evening's séance ; she was, however, very bright
and cheerful.
Mental suggestion to-day,
“
Vi
”
and the word written by Miss Hurd inside
folded papers pinned on a board and unknown to me.
First experimenL—1l-0 to 1l-35. Double frame, with cardboards held
between Mrs. Deane's hands, which were taped down as usual; chalk and
pencil between cards; result, nil.
(195) Second experiment
—Tape - stocks with easel,
chalk of blue colour, and
a piece of pencil chosen
after the hands were
locked up, and then in
serted in the channels by
me, namely, the pencil in
the right hand channel
and the blue chalk in the
left-hand channel. "S"
and
“
Vi
"
(my mental H L
suggestion) appeared very Mo “00!
early upon the paper on the
easel in blue chalk (Fig. Fig- 348
349). On the paper under
her left hand appeared, in
blue chalk, the word “Nell”
in mirror writing. There
was a good deal of noise
of chalk rolling in the
channel. The blue chalk
was in the channel at the
end of the sitting. The
piece of pencil put in the
right channel was found
on the ﬂoor. (Fig. 348.)
(196) Third experiment
-—Without releasing her
hands I left the papers
pinned on the board under
Mrs. Deane's hands and
placed two half-plates on
them under her two
hands. Mrs. Deane then
exclaimed
"
Something has
'
been placed softly on my Qo00726
hands." It was the easel,
'
BM Maw’
and it was lying quite
square with the base of
the stocks. It is not easy Fig- 349
to remove the easel from the base. Mrs. Deane said,
"
I wonder, could they
put it back ?
"
We left the easel lying on Mrs. Deane's hands. I heard some
HANDS 8r FEET EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (1.960) to (198) Page 213
tapping as though on glass. I found, after a few minutes, the easel was in
position, the square pin being in the hole. I found it difficult, using two hands,
in the ruby light to ﬁnd the hole and insert the pin. Duration of experiment
ﬁfteen minutes. Mrs. Deane's hands were found securely taped in the stocks
at the end of this experiment.
(1964) Comment—This putting the easel back with the square pin inserted
in its hole was, certainly, impossible of performance by Mrs. Deane under
the conditions prevailing.
Fourth experiment—I removed the two half-plates and replaced them with
two others, not releasing Mrs. Deane's hands from the stocks. A strange thing
occurred during this experiment. I had my right elbow on the second shelf
and was leaning somewhat forward, with one hand over the other, the left hand
over the right, and the ﬁngers of the left hand overhanging the right hand.
I felt those ﬁngers touched very slightly. Then they were decidedly brushed
from below (there were two touches) by the edge of a piece of stifﬁsh paper.
At that moment Mrs. Deane exclaimed,
“
Have you touched my head-paper ?
"
She was remaining quite still and motionless, and I heard no sound. On opening
the door and experimenting, it was plain that Mrs._Deane could not have
lowered her head sufﬁciently to get the edge of the head-paper under my
ﬁngers. An extraordinary inexplicable happening.
(197) I developed the four half-plates same evening. Nothing on the plates
and, although the day was warm, Mrs. Deane's ﬁngers do not seem to have
marked the plates in any way.
July 27th, 1926,—The weather was bright and the light good. Mrs. Deane
was in a more complaining mood than usual.
First experiment—Double frame, with cardboards, with hands taped on
them ; pencil and chalk put inside after imprisoning the hands ; twenty minutes,
no result. I suggested the word I was thinking of, and which I had written
down in my notebook, kept in my pocket. I did not get it to-day. Head-paper,
breast-paper, and foot-paper. Mrs. Deane took off her shoes and sat with her
stockinged feet resting on a piece of clean paper; behind her heels I pinned
the shallow lid of a box. I put therein a piece of crimson chalk chosen from
among many colours. I covered Mrs. Deane's lap with my black cloth, reaching
well to the ﬂoor; all this was done before the ﬁrst experiment, with the door
open. After fastening her hands for the ﬁrst experiment I shut the door, and
did not open it again until the end of the sitting.
(198) After the ﬁrst experiment I imprisoned Mrs. Deane's hands in the
hand-stocks. The wood into which the drawing pins are ﬁxed is very hard, and
l have to exert great pressure (my thumbs are very strong) to push the pins home.
Mrs. Deane could not have pushed them home. My nails are very strong
indeed, and I have the greatest difﬁculty in getting them under the heads of the
drawing pins to withdraw the pins. It is out of the question that Mrs. Deane
could withdraw these pins and put them back again. I made absolutely sure
that she could not withdraw her hands, the tape was put too closely round the
wrists. The easel was put in position. It is impossible for Mrs. Deane or anyone
else to withdraw the easel by hand or wrist movement while the wrists are
taped down, without my detection, nor could she do it by means of her mouth.
Yet after a little time the easel was placed quietly and without any noise, and
softly, in some mysterious manner, on the back of Mrs. Deane's hands and wrists.
I had my red torchlight hanging from my neck, and I used it frequently to
supplement the light from the window. We sat some time longer, hoping the
easel would ﬁnd its way back again, and its pin get into the hole, but there
seemed to be insuﬁoicient power. The easel moved a little now and again, and
then fell on the ﬂoor. I put it back on Mrs. Deane's hands and wrists, and
Page 214 Pars. (1.99) (200) HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS.
shortly afterwards the easel transferred itself from the backs of Mrs. Deane's
hands right on to the neighbouring shelf, which was on the level with the hands.
The easel was right on the shelf, square on, so that the outer edge of the easel
corresponded with the outer edge of the shelf. It is quite out of the question
that Mrs. Deane could have done this.
I had put a piece of sienna coloured chalk in one channel of the stocks, and a
copying-ink pencil in the other; after ﬁfteen minutes I discontinued this
experiment. There was nothing on the easel and nothing on the papers under
the hands.
(199) Mrs. Deane's hands were not then released. I left the easel in position,
also the board with the papers, and slipped under Mrs. Deane's hands two half
plates, Marion Brilliant. After ten minutes I removed the glass plates and did not
see anything on them. I then put two fresh half-plates under Mrs. Deane's
hands (still locked up) and we sat for about ten minutes. I removed these
plates, and I fancied I saw a brownish mark on one of the plates, but I did
not look carefully, as I did not wish to expose it much, even to red light, and I
should see it at home soon enough. For the result of development see page 59.
I then opened the door. Mrs. Deane's hands were still imprisoned. I removed
the easel, and found on the paper on the easel the letters
"
A.S." The colour
and substance of the marks are exactly similar to a mark I made with the crimson
chalk which I had put in the shallow lid behind Mrs. Deane's heels.
I removed the board from under Mrs. Deane's feet and found a large
"
S
"
written on the paper in crimson under Mrs. Deane's right foot near the heel,
3-in. long, and round about both feet there was a lot of crimson smudging.
I will mention that Mrs. Deane had no opportunity whatsoever of reaching down
to pick up the piece of crimson chalk I had put there. Add to this the fact that
the
"
A.S
"
came upon the easel while Mrs. Deane's hands were imprisoned
during the photographic plate experiments. Mrs. Deane did not know what
coloured chalk I had chosen to put in the box lid near her heels. Nothing on the
head-paper, nothing on the breast-paper.
August 3rd, 1926,—Weather bright and very warm. Mrs. Deane very
amiable, but complained of neuralgia.
(200) The chief phenomena which occurred were the lifting of the easel out
of its position while Mrs. Deane's hands were secured in the stocks, and the
placing of it on Mrs. Deane's hands. Every time the easel moved out of place
I put it back. It came out about ﬁve times ; thrice on the backs of Mrs. Deane's
hands, once on to the shelf, which is on a level with her hands, and once, which
was most extraordinary, the easel was placed on to the upper shelf, 18-in. above
her lap. It was placed quite ﬂat on to the shelf and right in, not overhanging.
It is quite impossible for anyone to carry out such a transport of the easel
by any movement of the hands in the stocks, or with the stocks. It is not at
all easy to withdraw the easel from the stocks on account of the length and
roughness of the pin. Its slope away from Mrs. Deane would make the task
much more difﬁcult to anyone sitting as sat Mrs. Deane.
August 10th, 1926,—Weather showery but bright at intervals. Mrs. Deane
was in a very good humour, but complained of slight neuralgia, and a bad night
on Sunday. This is Tuesday.
I found waiting for me in the studio an American lawyer, Mr. G. H. Breaker,
from Houston, Texas, a member of the American S.P.R. My meeting
Mr. Breaker is interesting in view of his obtaining with Mrs. Deane an Extra
face which he recognised, from the illustration of the Jack Burnside Extra*
published in Psychic Science, as being that of my cousin Jack Burnside (seepage 40).
" Duplication of Extras is not at all uncommon; as though, to save labour, an old
transparency or whatever is employed is re-employed. Mr. Glendinning had the same
Extra seven times with Duguid (Borderland, Vol. III, p. 315). TrailI Taylor had similar
experience with Duguid.
H & F EXPERIMENTS. Pars. (201) (202) Figs. 350, 351 Page 215
(201) I had brought with me to-day, unheralded, a new piece of apparatus
which I call the "Shutter." This is described and illustrated on page 110.
(202) First experimenL—Door open, foot‘paper, head-paper, and breast-
paper. Mrs. Deane took her shoes 0H and sat with her stockinged feet on a foot
paper. I covered her lap with my black cloth. I had my own duster. I chose
a piece of chalk out of my box of twelve colours, and placed it in the lid of a box
pinned down behind Mrs. Deane's heels. I imprisoned Mrs. Deane's hands in the
stocks. I wiped her hands and rubbed clean paper upon them as usual.
I then put the board with two pieces of paper ﬁxed on it at my ofﬁce by
Miss Hurd, under her hands. Thereupon I chose a piece of red coloured chalk
and put it in the right-hand channel,
and I put a piece of copying ink
pencil in the left-hand channel.
Then I ﬁxed the new piece of
apparatus in position. I closed the
door. I had my electric torch handy
and used it. While the experiment
was in progress I used the torch, and
Mrs. Deane, who faced the card
board, said,
“
There are two marks
on the sooted cardboard." When
the experiment was ﬁnished, after
about twenty minutes, and the door
was opened, I found on the smoked
cardboard
"
VI." Mrs. Deane stated
that when she ﬁrst saw the markings
they were two simple strokes, and
that one was converted into the
“
V "
afterwards by an additional
stroke.

(203) Second cxperiment=—Saine as last. I re-sooted the cardboard, not
preserving the marks. I did not undo Mrs. Deane's hands; they were still im
prisoned, and the same chalk and pencil were in position, everything as before.
I had my torch well in hand; we sat for about half an hour, at the end of which
time I opened the door and found, on the sooted cardboard, "VI" again, and
below that a
“
T." (Fig. 350, page 215). The wooden curtain had not been pushed
in. On the paper under Mrs. Deane's right hand I found, written with red coloured
chalk, the words "Sergent VIT" (Fig. 351, page 215). As regards the mark "Vl'l0"
see page 217. Neither Mrs. Deane nor I can associate the
“
Sergent VIT "
with
anything we can remember.
(2034) Comment—I was told at a Deane séance that the
“
S's
”
I obtain
so frequently represent a Frenchman and I was not to try to identify him.
It is only lately (1934) that I have come to think that the above mark may be
his name voluntarily given; VIT probably meaning
“
lives." In Larousse
I ﬁnd the following entry:
“
Sergent (Antoine-Francois) a French draughts
man and engraver."
(203b) Nothing on the foot-paper or head-paper, but on the breast-paper
(9-in.X42-in.) appeared a scrawl in chalk of the same red colour as on the
hand-paper.
During the second experiment to-day Mrs. Deane complained of terrible
pain in her arm from the elbow downwards, as though someone were twisting
the arm. She said it was a special pain, not rheumatism. She has frequently
felt this pain during my experiments.
September 14th, 1926,—Head-paper, breast-paper, foot-paper. Nil.
(204) Mental suggestion,
“
John Warrick."
(205) First experiment—Stocks, chalks in channels, board with papers under
hands, shutter apparatus with smoked cardboard in front of Mrs. Deane's knees.
The shutter was pushed in about 2-in. At one time during this experiment
Mrs. Deane ﬁdgeted with her left arm
(it
is
not easy to keep still all the time—
let anyone try
it
I)
and called my attention to the outside pin of that arm
having become loose.
I
reﬁxed
it
and added a second pin at that side.
I
examined Mrs. Deane's ﬁngers after the experiment
;
they were not black.
On the smoked cardboard was
a
line like an
“
S" reversed, made of short
pieces of line nearly all of the same size.
I
am sure
it
was impossible for
Mrs. Deane to have made this disjointed line without my seeing her do it.
I
kept using my torch.
(206) Second experi
ment The ﬁrst experi
ment continued. Result
of this experiment was
the addition on the
smoked cardboard of
a
broken line to the re-
versed making
it
into
a

September 16th. 1926,—Weather bright and warm. Mrs. Deane cheerful.
(207) My mental suggestion to-day was my grandfather, John Warrick.
First experiment—Stocks, chalks in channels, paper under hands, shutter
in front of Mrs. Deane's knees with smoked cardboard on it. Two drawing
pins on outside of Mrs. Deane's wrists on both sides, to make sure. This was
Mrs. Deane's own suggestion.
A sound as of paper rubbing somewhere near Mrs. Deane's hands. I brought
torch to bear: noise continued. As it seemed to come from card on shutter
I tested shutter; it would not move. I found I had ﬁxed the cardboard so
that it protruded below beyond the edge of the wood, and caught on the lower
edge of frame ; it was evident protracted efforts had been made to push in the
shutter. I opened the door, pared the cardboard with my knife and closed the
door. The shutter was then pushed in %-in. I opened the door. There were
scrawls on the cardboard on the lower part, nothing under hands.
(208) Second experi-
menL—I removed the
cardboard and ﬁxed it
upside down, so that the
blank part was lowest.
We sang. I suggested
the name I was thinking
of should appear on the
cardboard, or at least
the initials thereof, or
under Mrs. Deane's
hands. Result, a distinct

(208a) Oct. 5th, 1926, to March 1st, 1927.—During 0ct0ber,N0vembcr,
December, 1926, and January and March, 1927, I continued sittings with
Mrs. Deane. I am not giving the details of these sittings as nothing much
happened. Lately good results were few and far
between. It will be remembered that on April 27th
last I received in direct writing
"
Goodbye

Notwithstanding that Mrs. Deane had told me
on the 13th of April, 1926, and repeated it at other
sittings, that she was impressed that I should get
results by placing photographic plates under her

hands continually for three months ; on my carrying

out her suggestion there were very meagre results.
I engaged an assistant to sit in my place while
I directed the experiments from outside the cabinet. 1
I also engaged a violinist to play, as it is generally
i
thought that music has a favourable effect. Whether
the power had waned or the newcomer exercised an
inhibitory inﬂuence, the fact remains that the results
during these months were ver or. We got some

and I had satisfactory conﬁrmation from my assistant of my statement that
the light through the red glass window was quite sufficient to enable the medium's
hands and the easel of the stocks, etc., to be seen, unless the weather was very
dull; then the red torch was made constant use of. The best results my
assistant received were the following two.
(209) January 4th, 1927,—On this day, under very good control, an “S"
appeared in blue chalk on the piece of paper under Mrs. Deane's right hand,
and on the paper under Mrs. Deane's left hand written in blue chalk the word
Vit
(?)
French for lives (Fig. 354). While Mrs. Deane's hands were taped
down in the stocks,
a
piece of blue chalk had been inserted in the channel by me
and was there at the end of the experiment.
The reader should compare this mark (Fig. 354, page 217) with the similar
marks (Figs. 350 and 351, page 215). (See also page 216.)
(209¢) February 13!, 1927—Thewords
“
no more" appeared in direct
writing while my assistant was sitting. Just previously to this séance
I
had
instructed my assistant to come no more after this date.

outer room) and myself. Weather bright and warm. Mrs. Deane amiable,
but complaining of her cold. Usual precautions taken. My mental suggestion

(210) Second experiment — Mrs.
Deane's hands were securely fas
tened down by means of tapes on
each side of the double frame, hold
ing cardboards, previously described
(see Figure 182, page 109). After
Mrs. Deane's hands were fastened
I
chose
a
piece of red chalk from
a
box of many colours, and put
it
between the two cardboards by
means of the %-in. space between
the frames. Mrs. Deane's knees
were covered with my black cloth.
I
wrapped her hands (strapped on
the double frame) tightly round
with
a
second black cloth.

had
my electric torch frequently in

I
frequently put my
hands down to feel that Mrs. Deane
was holding the two frames level.
She could not (without my know

which would be necessary in order
to shake out the chalk.

the wrists. At the end of ﬁfteen
minutes
I
removed the black cloth and unpinned Mrs. Deane's hands. The
chalk was still between the cardboards. On removing the top cardboard
I
found.
HANDS & FEET EXPERIMENTS. Par. (211) Page 219
on the inner surface of one cardboard, a line sketch of a man's, and, below that,
more perfect, one of a woman's face. This line sketch was close up against
the vertical edge of the frame and the lines were drawn so close to the frame,
it would have been impossible to produce these by normal means under the
conditions.
The chalk was a blunt-ended piece, and the line of the woman's face was
quite uniform and of even thickness, and went right up against the wooden
frame. The space between the two frames is so narrow, the width being %-in.,
it was quite impossible for Mrs. Deane to insert her ﬁnger, even had she known
which coloured chalk I was going to use ; besides, her hands were strapped down.
I had wiped her hands before the experiment with my duster, and had them in
full view in the daylight while I adjusted the frames to her hands. It is out of
the question that she could have put this mark on. I had brought with me
this day, as at every sitting, the double frames with clean cards pinned in
position.
This was my last sitting with Mrs. Deane in 1927.
(211) October 8th, 1928,—Sitting with Mrs. Deane at my warehouse.
Mrs. Deane arrived at 4-15. She and I went down into a windowless room
where everything had been prepared. After we entered the room neither of
us left it. Mrs. Deane sat on a box. I placed an electric storage battery lamp
so that the light (red) shone especially on Mrs. Deane's lap. I had brought
a head-band, which I had previously handed to my clerk, Miss Hurd, for
examination, and which Miss Hurd assured me she had found free from marks.
I also had seen that it was quite free from marks. I tied it on Mrs. Deane's head.
I put a sheet of cartridge paper, which was rather dirty from a previous experi
ment, under Mrs. Deane's feet. I then covered her lap and shins with a large black
cloth, which extended down to the ﬂoor. I pulled it over the toes, so that her
toes, feet and legs were in darkness, and the lap was covered with my black cloth.
After the placing of the black cloth, I put a piece of chalk in the lid of a box
and placed it behind the heels of Mrs. Deane's boots. Her boots were very
dirty from walking; all these preparations were made in daylight with the
door open. I gave Mrs. Deane a packet of wax-paper to hold between her
hands and I shut the door. We sat like0that for half an hour, Mrs. Deane with
her hands on her lap with the wax-paper between her hands, the lamp shining
on her hands. At the commencement of the sitting I allowed a little gas jet
to illuminate the room until my eyes got accustomed to the semi-darkness, when
the red light from the lamp was sufficient. There was continuous noise with
the wax-paper, as though it was being fumbled about. Mrs. Deane and I both
remarked upon it. I was observing closely and I know Mrs. Deane was not
doing it. After the sitting we examined the wax-paper carefully; there was
nothing inside or outside.
I then gave Mrs. Deane a pair of quarter-plates, sensitive sides outwards,
back to back, to hold between her hands, and I held my hands over hers for
ten minutes to a quarter of an hour ; I then gave her another pair to hold by her
self, back to back, under my close observation. She held them for about ﬁve
minutes. I put the plates in a box and the box in my pocket, to develop at my
rooms. A cursory glance did not reveal any marks on them. These quarter
plates were dated and initialled by me previous to the sitting.
I then put Mrs. Deane's hands in the stocks and a board, with papers,
under her hands, and the easel in position. We sat like that for half an
hour. At the end of the half-hour I opened the door; I freed Mrs. Deane's hands.
Nothing was found on the papers under the hands. By-the-by, I forgot to put
chalks in the channel, so there was nothing for the 'operator' to work with. I

(211) Comment—One of my most
successful sittings with Mrs. Deane;
adding valuable further support to the
evidence of telepathy and apportage,
and intelligent highly skilful use of the
apported material invisibly and per the
fourth dimension, both as regards
time and space.
Fig. 356 Fig- 357
removed the head-band and was astonished to ﬁnd on it a brownish drawing
of a ring of the same size as that obtained three years ago, on September 8th,
1925 (see page 182). On removing the foot-paper there was also a ring upon that;
they are both of the same size ({";-in.) in diameter (Fig. 356 X {linear approx).
As regards these two rings, it is a curious fact that when I was working at
an invention, in September, 1925 (three years ago), in which discs of brass
about g-in. in diameter with raised edges were to be employed, there
came on the foot-paper and head-paper (on September 8th, 1925) rings like
those of to-day (see full details on page 183). Since 1925 the matter had been
in abeyance, and had not received my attention. Curiously enough, about the
date of this sitting, October, 1928, when I was taking the matter up again, and
was making further experiments with these brass pieces (I had just written to
the metal turners and obtained a quotation for the brass pieces from them, which
I have in writing as evidence) these rings appear on the foot and head-papers
again, and, what clinches the matter, a similar ring appeared upon one of the
photographic quarter-plates Mrs. Deane had held between her hands, as
described above. I found that one plate had a brown circular mark upon
it,
viz.
:
the ring shown in the illustration (Fig. 356
X
1
linear about). This
is
of the same diameter as the other two rings. On development this ring remained,
but the silver salt under
it
was not affected
;
nothing more came upon this plate
on development and nothing on the other three. Mrs. Deane knew nothing
about my having just renewed my interest in the brass pieces. Had she known
she could not have produced the rings under the conditions prevailing without
detection by me. She could most certainly not have put the brown ring on the
photographic plate. It has been pointed out to me that
a
similar mark can be
made by the use of the bottom of
a
bottle with
a
suitable base,
if
the bottom
of such a bottle were moistened with
a
brown liquid and applied to
a
plate.
In such
a
case the removal of the bottle from the plate would most likely leave
exactly such
a
blob as
is
seen in the illustration of the ring in question. Such
a
control ring has been made with
a
bottle of somewhat larger diameter, and
is
here illustrated by photographic means. (Fig. 357.)
CHAPTER VIII.
Abstracts of Seances.
In lroduction.
Mrs. Deane had been in the habit of holding weekly séances at her home,
the circle being formed of herself, her two daughters, one or both, with a few
neighbours (spiritualists). No payment was made.
It was reported to me that many weird things had happened at the séances
and that ghostly forms had been seen clairvoyantly, so much so that
Miss Lilian Deane became frightened and discontinued sitting on that account.
I asked permission to join the circle as a friend, no payment being suggested
or made, and after the guides had been consulted and given their consent, I was
admitted as a member and took part at my ﬁrst sitting on February 28th, 1923.
I have since been a regular attendant until July, 1926, when the séances ceased.
I assisted at about 140 séances.
We sat round a three-legged table, weighing 6 lbs., with a round top 18-in.
in diameter. The vertical height from the ﬂoor to the upper surface of the
table is 27-in.
I requested Mrs. Deane that we should try to obtain table-raising. The
ﬁrst evening the table rose fully two feet, and since then we had innumerable
elevations of the table until we gave that up and tried for other phenomena.
The séances generally lasted from 8 to 10-30 pm.
Early in the year 1923 it was suggested by me that we should try to obtain
photographs of the table when raised above the ﬂoor and, Mrs. Deane's guide
consenting thereto, we obtained about sixty such photographs. We had some
times three, sometimes four cameras focussed on the centre of the circle—three
half-plates and one quarter-plate. I always brought the half-plate slides with
me ready loaded, with plates numbered and initialled. The quarter-plate
Mrs. Deane loaded herself. The cameras were placed at various heights in
order to obtain views of the table from above and below. The séances were
conducted in the dark. The camera caps were left off. I operated a ﬂashlight
apparatus and it was agreed that I should ﬂash whenever I liked. There being
no electric current at the Engleﬁeld Road quarters I had to rely upon ﬂint and
steel sparks, which apparatus I operated by means of a cord from my seat at the
table unless otherwise stated. There were many failures on account of the
unreliability of the means employed.
The liberty I had to ﬂash at any time without warning constituted a great
safeguard against trickery, but indeed there was no object in cheating, fooling
ourselves week after week for three years. Why did Mrs. Deane, her daughters
and neighbours have séances in her kitchen before I came on the scene ? The
lure of the mysterious? The sittings were private; there was no kudos or
money got from them.
The prolonged, violent movements of the table at nearly every sitting could
not have been produced by one or two of the sitters without their betraying
themselves by pufﬁng and blowing and knocking against their neighbours, if
at all, for the table was constantly travelling about with great violence. Besides,
there was no telling when I might ﬂash for photographs, and there was always
Pu: 221
Page 222 Pars (211a), (211b), (211c), (211d) SEANCES
the possibility of the ﬂashlight going off by accident. One needs to be present,
however, at such phenomena to appreciate the impossibility of the sustained,
rapid, violent movements of the table being the result of trickery. Such
movements are among the A.B.C. of experienced students of psychic physical
phenomena; they interest us here chieﬂy as bearing witness to Mrs. Deane's
psychic power in this direction.
(211a) On March 28th, 1923, I introduced a wire fence enclosing the ﬂoor
space in which the table stood, to guard the table from the sitters' dresses and
feet; this was a very useful innovation—preventing action by the sitters' feet.
The wire fence was ﬁve holes to the inch, 16-in. high, forming a ring two feet in
diameter ; it was not ﬁxed to the ﬂoor or to the table. The violent gyrations
of the table often put the fence out of shape, as is seen in the photographs.
(21 1 b) On September 26th, 1923, I brought to the circle a double disc which
I call my biplane, of the same diameter as the table top, each disc being of thin,
three-ply wood, separated from the other by six columns of wood one inch square
in section, three inches high, ﬁxed equidistantly in the margins. The outer
surfaces of the discs were painted with luminous paint, enabling the hands on
the top one to be seen. The biplane was laid loosely on the table and our hands
were placed on the upper surface of the upper disc. That the disc was loose
I frequently conﬁrmed by trial. By the employment of this biplane there was
no hand in immediate contact with the table. I obtained two sets of three
simultaneous photographs of the table raised well in the air under these
conditions (wire fence and biplane in use) on October 17th and 30th, 1923
(see pages 264 and 265).
(211g) It was my habit at every sitting from October, 1923, to pin a piece
of white cardboard, 15-in. in diameter, on the under surface of the table and
blacken it with soot from a turpentine ﬂame.
Some of the marks which appeared on the cardboard disc are illustrated
in this book and appear to be decidedly evidential.
We had a cardboard trumpet with luminous bands thereon. It very frequently
ﬂoated about the room, striking various sitters. We also had a small tambourine,
the parchment of which was painted with luminous paint on both sides. This
also moved about. We saw on many occasions ﬂoating lights and felt cold breezes.
Mrs. Deane very often went into trance and spoke in strange voices. We
also had some direct voices.
At times I brought to the sitting a quarter-plate in a box for skotographic
experiments, i.e., to try the inﬂuence of the circle upon it (see chapter IV).
(211d) On March lst, 1926, I introduced at the circle as a surprise without
any warning, a piece of apparatus, which I call an automatic ﬂasher (Fig. 358, page
223). The principal feature of this is a balanced platform with an extended arm, at
the end of which is ﬁxed a rigid iron wire, which, when the arm descends, dips
into a cup of mercury and thereby completes an electric circuit. The apparatus
is so balanced that the weight of the platform is insufﬁcient to raise the arm.
On the platform is placed a trumpet of cardboard. Inside the trumpet,
attached to the narrow end thereof, is a loose cord 9-in. longer than the
trumpet. To the free end of the cord is attached a conical weight, which is
sufficiently heavy to keep the platform horizontal and the iron wire out of the
mercury.
The trumpet is placed upon this platform with the weight inside. When
the trumpet is raised more than 9-in., the weight also is raised by the cord ; the
platform then rises and the iron wire descends into the mercury. An electric
circuit is thereby completed and produces a ﬂash (at a distance). It follows
that the ﬂash is practically instantaneous with the rising of the trumpet, and,
as experiment has proved, the photograph obtained would not fail to show
any arm which had raised the trumpet.

Since the diagram here printed was drawn,
I
have introduced an improve

I
put, instead of the weight,
a
12-in. rod of light wood about
il-in. in diameter. This rod stands within the trumpet.
It
is
tied to the free

a
length
that only when the trumpet has risen nearly free of the rod does the rod rise
with

it
is
necessary for the trumpet to rise vertically, practically 12-in., in order to
produce
a
ﬂash. When the weight was raised
it
was possible for the trumpet
to fall over as soon as
it
reached the height of the wire ring (see

is
a ﬁxture (see diagram) and acts as a guard.

and the electric’circuit has a gap. When the table
is
tilted beyond
a

angle the ball rolls to the edge and bridges the gap and so closes the circuit.
Page 224 Pars. (211e) (212) (213) SEANCES
A detailed report of each sitting was written out by me, or at my dictation,
the same evening, or the evening following.
It was my constant practice to arrive at the séance room half an hour before
the commencement of the sitting, and not to leave the room. When my friend
.\Ir. Bird came (he attended regularly for many months) he accompanied me
and was with me in the room the whole time.
Miss Vi Deane often assisted me with the preparation of the smoked card
board, the chairs, etc, but not with the cameras. Mrs. Deane generally
arrived late from the West End. She then had a little supper in the kitchen
and did nothing more than prepare her camera (as a rule only one half-plate)*;
the slides of this and of my own camera were always brought with me, having
been loaded at my factory with numbered and initialled plates.
In my abstracts of the Deane séances the greater part of the matter is not
evidential, but there is enough to prove the reality of Mrs. Deane's powers,
especially clairvoyance. I include the non-evidential matter to give the reader a
fairly full account of our proceedings.
Much of the following is uninteresting, but my aim is not to produce an
entertaining book, but to put my experiences with Mrs. Deane on record.
She was undoubtedly the main source of the supemormal power. These
many table movements and elevations and the many other phenomena
described in the abstracts from my séance notes prove her possession of strong
psychic power and help to support the view that her abnormal photographs
are also due to a mysterious power she possesses, or which acts through her.
The knowledge acquired by me of the sitters, my observation of their
manner and conversation impressed me favourably.
oThis half-plate camera was one lent her by me for the purpose of these experiments.

Any expressions such as
“ controls," "
guides," Brown Wolf, Topsy, rtc.,
are used by nu: for convenience only and do not imply that I have any settled view
as to the correctness of these terms.
February 28th, I923.—I told Mrs. Deane that I was very anxious to see the séance table
rise in the air, as I had never witnessed such a phenomenon.
(21 Ia) After we had placed our hands on the table, the latter tilted rapidly and moved about.
Later, it banged upon the ﬂoor with one leg so heavily that I was fearful of a hole being
made in the ﬂoor-boards and the table being broken. The table then rose fully two feet
from the ground with our hands still upon it.
Next, Miss Lilian Deane
"
went off," and it was quite distressing to me to hear the
stuttering efforts she made to get out a word. After a time, there came spasmodically the
words, " Book," “
Blue Book," " Book Case," "Large Room," "
Red Curtains," "
Cook."
Then, very loud, followed, "
I am Charlie Cook, Man," which meant that I was addressed,
I being the only man present.
I recognised at once the large room with red curtains and a large, important bookcase,
as a. description of my own chambers, which were quite unknown to the Deanes.
I remembered, also, that the book I was reading at the time was a work on Psychic Photo
graphy by Charles Hall Cook (The Christian name written Charley or Charlie being a special
feature).
(212) March 7th, 1923.—The table, after rapping out twice "Keen Lee Loo," rapped
out, quite distinctly,
"
Take to-morrow's Tclngraph, Page 4, Column 3, Good News." (The
following day's Telegraph, in which I checked these directions, contained in column 6 of
page 4 a paragraph stating that a large number of psychic photographs were to be shown
at a forthcoming exhibition of the Photographic Society. Column 3 contained nothing of
signiﬁcance.) Sitting held 8 to ro-3o p.ui. as usual.
(213) Mrs. Deane then went into trance and, after her North American guide, Brown Wolf,
had spoken in a. loud voice, the voice of a girl, known to the circle as Hulah, came through
Mrs. Deane. Hulah conversed round the circle, and, when she came to me, asked why
I turned my back when l was photographed (which I had done on a. recent occasion) and
SEANCES Pars. (214) to (216a) Page 225
mentioned the baldness of the back of my head. I suggested that she should try to place
a mark on my head at my next sitting with Mrs. Deane. Hulah asked what mark she should
put, and I replied, "Something deﬁnite. A triangle or a square, for instance." She
promised to do her best.
(On March 12th, I sat with Mrs. Deane for photography, and a triangle appeared about
my head, as shown in Fig. 86, page 36.)
March 21st, 1923.—At the previous séance, the table had acquiesced in my request to
be allowed to take a photograph. I, therefore, brought my camera. As soon as we
had started, the table moved and rapped out, " Take photo now." I did not do so, as the
table was not in the air, but, later, when it rose a little, I ﬂashed and secured my ﬁrst photo
graph of the table raised.
April 4th, 1923,—Without any warning, the table rose into the air and quickly descended
with one leg on the other side of the wire fence, which is 16 inches high. I had no time to ﬂash.
April Ilth, 1923.-—Aftcr making riotous movements, the table ascended so high that
Mrs. Deane lost the top altogether. It ﬂoated about, fell, rose again, and ﬁnally descended
outside the fence. Meanwhile, Mrs. Deane had gone into a trance and was controlled by
her Indian guide, who emitted, through her, violent yells and shouts in an incomprehensible
tongue. Then the voice changed to that of Hulah, who,in answer to a question by myself,
explained the absence of Extras in the photographs Mrs. Deane takes of me by asserting
that I worried the medium. She told me to keep to the same arrangement for several
(214) sittings. She asked the name of the "funny white nuts you eat." At that time, I was
having at lunch some white pine kernel nuts (an uncommon nut), a fact unknown to the
other members of the circle.
(215) April 18th. 1923.—After giving clairvoyantly apparently true descriptions of two
old friends of my youth, Hulah said she would try to put a crescent, which was her
“ emblem,"
on my plate at my next sitting for photographs. (On April 23rd a crescent did appear on a
photograph which Mrs. Deane took of me.) (See page 36.)
(216) Lilian cried out that she had been roughly touched on the arm by some entity, and
felt as though she had been scratched. She was very frightened and called out repeatedly
for us to light the gas. We soothed her, but she was very much upset. I joked about the
matter, and asked the entity to pull my nose, which it did not do, however. Mrs. Gilbert
and Mrs. Deane were touched. When we turned on the light, it was found Mrs. Gilbert's
locket and chain were on the ﬂoor within the fence, the locket closed, and the photo from
inside the locket apart from it. Mrs. Gilbert said the photo comes out of the locket with
great ditﬁculty.
April 25th, 1923.—Lilian, the elder daughter, will not sit any more; she was so scared
at the last sitting.
Mrs. Deane went into trance. Hulah came and stated there was something she could not
understand forming an obstruction in my photographic experiments with Mrs. Deane. She
and I appeared not at all to harmonise in that respect. There was something antagonistic
between us. A new voice came then which gave the name "Sarah," and called us
" a
funny lot" because of our sitting as we were. (For illustrations see page 248.)
June 6th, 1923.4The table went up fairly high, and after remaining up (for an unusual length
of time, so I was told) went down quite slowly. I was at the other side of the room attending
to the ﬂashlamp. I pulled the trigger and there was a ﬂash. It seemed to me to be much
too prolonged. The ﬂash powder seems to get damp owing to its being exposed so long to
the air of the room. There had been three previous good elevations. In the photographs
the table appears to be fully r2-in. from the ﬂoor (not reproduced).
Mrs. Deane in a trance spoke with a strange voice, which I was told was that of a
mischievous child-control known as
"
Topsy." After Topsy came Hulah, who said she would
put a star on photo plates (see result).
(216a) On developing the plates used for the elevation of the table, there was an extraordinary
addition to two plates (one quarter-plate and one half-plate) used in Mrs. Deane's cameras
(Figs. 360 and 361, page 226). I brought Mrs. Deane's half.plate slide loaded. On her two plates
there was a large seven-pointed Star, more like seven spokes of a wheel, without any hub,
than a Star. On my half-plate this Star did not appear. These Stars are not exactly alike on
each plate. These two plates were not sutficiently controlled by me for the results to be
evidential.
As I have stated elsewhere that Mrs Deane possessed no half-plate camera I would
mention that the slide alluded to above was lent her by me with its camera for these sittings.
It is worth noting that on Whit-Sunday, ten days previously, Mrs. Deane had photo
graphed the altar of a small church near Lincoln. On the photograph appeared, together
with the altar, a seven-pointed Star very similar to those mentioned above. (See illustration,
Fig. 359, page 226.) The three stars are all diﬂerent.
Page Figs2359, 360, 361 Pars. (217)
to (219) SEANCES
Fig. 359 Fig. 360
(21 7) Comment—If Mrs. Deane had desired to put a Star on the altar, and on these plates,
she would surely have put something more like a Star ; besides, no object at all was served
by the introduction of the star-like marks on the levitation plates.
If the medium really does possess some power not possessed by others to project on to a
photographic plate things which have been seen by her [or her sitters], then we may hazard
the guess that in the bright light of the country the brilliant reﬂection of the sunlight from
the highly-varnished spokes of carriage wheels made a deep impression at some time or other
on one of Mrs. Deane's memory tablets, and got transferred in some way on to the plates.
June 20th, 1923.—The table indulged in boisterous movements. Only those who are
frequenters of sittings know how impossible it would be for a sitter to produce such boisterous,
irregular, eccentric movements without detection. After a long time it rose in the air
suddenly and descended quickly. There was no time to ﬂash. It rose again, and I produced
a fair ﬂash. The table then rose again, and we lost it ; it fell with a thump on the ﬂoor,
evidently some distance from us. When the gas was lit the table was found to be on its
side three feet from the circle, and the wire fence with it, also on its side. Mrs. Deane went
into trance and spluttered in a whispering way and muttered with difﬁculty, and sighed.
We asked her questions in English, but we got no response in English. Then "Sarah
"
came, laughing as before, again calling us a
"
funny lot." She appeared much amused at
our sitting, saying she had never seen anything of the kind in her day. She was asked her
surname; she said she had forgotten it, and was always called
" Sarah." Vi asked her if she
had not another name on the other side; in reply she asked whether
“
Sarah
"
was not
good enough. Then Brown \Volf came and remarked upon the table-raising, and spoke
(218) quite a time in his deep, strong voice. Hulah came through. She said there was a
man with her for me who had only one whole leg, the other one going down below the knee
only, with a funny piece of apparatus at the end of it; that he had brownish hair, slight
whiskers, a moustache, and that the colour of his face was not uniform, and that he passed
over ﬁve years ago. His eyes were darkish brown, she said. [This is an excellent description
of Mr. T., a traveller I employed for ﬁve years, and who died more than ﬁve years ago; he
was very friendly disposed towards me. He had an artiﬁcial foot and a mottled face.]
Hulah afterwards described many other persons present with her for all the other sitters,
some of them being recognised, and some not. While Hulah was there we all felt a cold
breeze blowing on our faces ; I remarked this myself once or twice. Some of the other sitters
had seen strong lights on me.
(219) June 27th, 1923,—The table rose very well and I ﬂashed; two good pictures
were obtained (not reproduced). Mrs. Deane went into a trance, and Hulah came through.
She said that the man with the incomplete leg was present. I asked if he had any message
for me. He said I was very good to him (I had been of some ﬁnancial use to him, and we
were good friends). I asked whether he was happy, and he said "Yes," and with no cobwebs
any more in his head. [He had gone out of his mind before he died] I asked him if he knew
how his son (whom I had lost sight of) was progressing. He replied that his son was all right,
and would have no cobwebs in his head. Mrs. Deane stated that she saw a bright cone, like
a candle extinguisher, big enough to enclose us all, like a bell tent, and from this extinguisher
came rays to each individual sitter. At one time during this sitting I tried to raise the table
while it was on the ﬂoor, and found it was as heavy as lead.
SEANCES Par. (220) Page 227
July 25th, I923.—The table began to move and to spell out "Take a photo," which
instruction I did not obey. The table went up several times, and fairly high on the ﬁfth
time, and I ﬂashed. After ﬂashing the table did not drop, but remained in the air quite
steady for about half a minute. I should mention that before this last rising, Mrs. Deane
went into a trance, without speaking, however, but she was awake when the table rose.
I would also mention that while Mrs. Deane and I were occupied in changing the plates in
the cameras (in the dark) the table was fairly lively with Vi and Mrs. Hurley, the sole sitters.
(220) Mrs. Deane was controlled by Brown Wolf, Topsy and Hulah. I suggested she (Hulah)
should help me with my Monday photographic experiments, and put a cross or a square on
my head. She said she would try. (Five days later, at my sitting with Mrs. Deane for
photographic experiments, a decided cross appeared, representing roughly a carrot and a
parsnip crossed.) (See page 36.)
I asked her to put her face there. She said she had given me her photo, but the Medic
had not pressed the colour screen close enough. [This refers to a colour photographo
Mrs. Deane took of me a little time back whereon appeared a beautiful girl's face as an
Extra.) She said that though I had secured no good results, I was beneﬁting from the
photography more than I knew; that I should have patience, and I should get something
in the end.
In all the photographs taken at the various séances, I had one hand only on the table,
as my left hand is always behind the sitter on my left, holding the string to pull the ﬂasher.
(For illustrations see pages 253 and 254.)
July 31st, I923.—Peter Riley and Hulah announced their presence through the table,
which gave incomplete messages only (as usual), but moved about a great deal. It continued
to move under the hands of the other two sitters, while Mrs. Deane and I were changing
the slides in the cameras. Rappings were heard in the other end of the room. The table
rose several times, and when it was about a foot high, as far as I could judge, it remained up
steadily, sufficiently long for me to exhort the sitters to keep their ﬁnger tips only on the table.
Mrs. Deane went into a trance ; Hulah came through at once. Brown Wolf then came
through and stated that Peter Riley was there. He expressed his strong antipathy to
Peter and his preaching. (For illustrations see page 255.)
Auguot 22nd, 1923,—Uahtrop came through the table. Uahtrop would not raise the
table, and would not make room for any other control, although asked by us to do so. He
is very obstinate. The circle had been told that Uahtrop was quite a low spirit, still in sphere
" two."
August 29%, 1923.—The table rose several times, and on one occasion moved away
towards the cameras and left all the sitters. We were a bit excited. Someone called out
"
The table has gone." I pulled the string without warning. The prints show the table
on the slant outside the wire fence, over which it had leapt. We put the table back inside
the fence. The table then rose quite gently, and so high that we had all to stand up to keep
our ﬁngers on the surface. It kept in the air at that height for quite a minute. The table
remained up and swayed as if on a cushion. There was a distinct cold breeze about.
Mrs. Deane went into trance, and the deep voice of an Irishman came out of her mouth,
"
Oh l my eye, my right eye," he kept on saying at intervals in the conversation.
" Who are you ?
"
we asked:
" Daniel," he said.
"
\Vhat is your surname?
" After a
pause, he said
"
MacFerguson." He said he lived a quarter of an hour's walk outside Cork,
at a place known as
"
Daniel's Place." He called for Molly and Nora, who, he said, were his
two bonnie children, and for Nora his wife, whose maiden name he said was O'Connor.
He repulsed the suggestion that he was on the
" other side." Could not make it out at all. The
damage to his eye was caused by half a. brick. He participated in doing damage to the
town of Cork and would do it again. (For illustrations see pages 256 and 260.)
September 12th, 1923.—I had brought a large gong, which I beat; it gave out a deep0
note. Immediately before this sitting I had operated in the séance room asmall Wimshurst
electric machine producing sparks. This did not inhibit the phenomena. Brown Wolf
soon came through the table, and when the gong was sounded the table responded vigorously.
Certainly the loud noise of the gong seemed to put life into him. I had noticed at previous
sittings that deep notes appear more effective. The table rose well into the air fairly early
in the sitting. We encouraged it to go higher; it did so, and we had to rise to our feet.
It remained up quite a time—say a minute. I pulled the cord and got a ﬂash. The table
went down quite slowly. This slow descent was remarked upon by the sitters, who said that
the table generally fell down after the ﬂash. This slow descent and the remark are rather
noteworthy. I had nothing to do with either. I did not introduce the subject. Now,
Dr. W. had asked me a. few days previously whether the table fell after a ﬂashlight. Perhaps
this exceptionally slow descent was connected in some way with Dr. W.0s question registered
in my mind. (For illuslralions see page 258.)
' See Appendix p. 282.
Page 228 Pars. (221) to (224) SEANCES
(221) September 1 911:, 1923. Usual circle. I brought a construction made of two
square pieces of three-ply wood, lo-in. X ro-in., ﬁxed together (with a. space of 2-in.
between them) by a pillar of wood at each corner, one outside face painted over with luminous
paint. This biplane is seen in ﬁgure 398, page 259. It is smaller than the circular one
described on page 222 which I used at séances subsequent to this date. At the commence
ment of the sitting this wooden contraption was placed loose on the table, luminous side
uppermost. I had made it of two boards with a space between so that the forces could get
under the one surface, as I had noticed at the last sitting, when I placed a single board on
the table, that before the board was tilted up it was moved so that part of it overhung the
table. It struck me this was done to enable something to work from underneath the board.
The three-ply wood construction was moved about on the surface of the table and tilted
up, and turned nearly right over. The table tilted about with the structure on it. It is
important to mention that we all placed our hands upon the three-ply wood only, and we
did not touch the table at all. The luminous paint rendered the hands visible. By the way,
the table was enclosed in the fence, as it always has been since the introduction of the wire
fence. It is clear from this experiment that the table could be moved while no one was
actually touching it, for the three-ply wood affair was quite free, simply resting upon it.
No one had been told that l was bringing this. I sprang it upon the circle as a surprise.
We sang, and the table kept time with our singing. The table rose and descended gently.
It rose again, and then a third time, and fairly high, and I ﬂashed. (For illustration see page 259.)
September 2611:, 1923,—A magnet was hung over the table, some four feet from the
top of it. This has remained during many sittings, but I do not think had any effect. I
brought with me to-day, without warning to the circle, the biplane described on page 222.
The table jumped about a lot with the biplane upon it, and Brown Wolf (who was the control)
made great efforts, as it seemed to us, to raise the table, but could not manage it. The
table tried to climb up the fence. At other sittings the legs of the table were constantly
scraping against this fence and put it quite out of shape temporarily. As it was getting
late, we removed the three-ply wood apparatus and sat with our hands on the table top
and suggested to Brown Wolf that he should now raise the table. He did this once or twice
a few inches, and a little later he raised it about 18-in., and I ﬂashed. Mrs. Deane then went
(222) into a trance. Brown Wolf came through. We chatted with him; the circle discussed
evolution, and I was thinking of telling them of the experiments recently made with mice,
which go to prove the inheritance of acquired qualities. Before I had mentioned about mice,
Brown Wolf broke in and said
" You are going to tell them about the mouses and experiments
made with them." (For illustrations see page 260.)
October ht, 1923.—Specia1 sitting. There were present: Mrs. Deane, Miss Lilian Deane,
Miss Burnside (my cousin), myself, and four guests—Parsees. There was room for three only
of the latter at the table. No charge was made at all for this sitting to anyone. No
charge is ever made for these sittings, and it is quite an exception to have strangers at them.
We put our hands upon the bare table and it moved about vigorously. After a lot of singing
the table rose and I ﬂashed. Mrs. Deane and I then changed the plates by turning the carriers
in the dark, and resumed our seats. The table rose a second time, slowly, and remained up
quite a while. I ﬂashed again. We then formed a circle of hands. After a time, one of the
Indian gentlemen, sitting between Mrs. Deane and her daughter, went into a trance. Two
of his friends got frightened and called him by name, and he seemed to get half awake. He
said
"
Why did you call me, where am I ? I was in such a beautiful place, I was in Paradise."
Photographs: two sets of three simultaneous exposures are illustrated (pages 261 and 262).
(223) October 10th, 1923.—Present usual circle less Mrs. Hogg. Mrs. Deane fell into
trance. Brown Wolf came through and said Mrs. Deane was going to do some packing in
March. The circle concluded it meant Mrs. Deane was going to move. (She did move against
her will the following March quarter.) Brown Wolf said Mrs. Deane would shortly manifest
a new, very important phase of mediumship. He did not say what it was. [In July next
year Mrs. Deane did develop a new phase of mediumship, which I discovered, namely, direct
writing on paper and glass,] He stated that to-day's sitting would not produce much result, as
all the power was being reserved for the nth November (Armistice Day). He stated that
there were masses of
"
Tommies
"
rehearsing drills for that occasion; he also said
“
Jack Tars."
(224) October I 7th, 1923,-The table had the round biplane, previously described, with
luminous paint on both outside surfaces, lying loosely upon it. Mrs. Deane went into a
trance. l-Iulah came through. She stated there were great preparations being made for the
nth November. Mrs. Deane came out of trance. The table moved about with the biplane
on it. The biplane stuck to it, as if it formed a part of the table (I often tested the biplane
to see that it was free). The table went up; then the sitter on my right lifted the biplane
from the table to examine the other side.
SEANCES Pars. (225) (226) Page 229
This adventitious lifting of the biplane was further proof that it was perfectly free from
the table. Brown Wolf was still in possession of Mrs. Deane. While Brown Wolf was
talking through Mrs. Deane I asked him whether he could help me to become psychic and
take photographs myself. His reply was not encouraging, but he said I should pray. I asked
him whether one should pray to the intermediate spirits. He said one should pray to the
Great Spirit and offer up thanksgiving. I think he added that thanksgiving was more powerful
than prayer. I forgot to mention that Brown Wolf told us to stand when the table went up,
as it helped. (For illustration see page 264.)
(225) October 30th, 1923.—Open cameras in position. The biplane with luminous paint
loose on the table ; all hands could be distinctly seen resting on the surface. The bar magnet
was still hanging from the ceiling over the table. The table soon rose, and remained
stationary in the air for some time—say a minute. I waited for it to go higher, but as it did
not, and was so steady, I pulled the cord and got a good ﬂash, with three excellent
simultaneous photographs. Mrs. Deane went into trance. Brown Wolf came through. As is
usual, when he commenced to speak, he spluttered and breathed somewhat heavily—a kind
of sigh through the lips, and he muttered in the same unknown tongue. He spoke the same
language rapidly and louder, as if speaking to himself. It was not long before Brown Wolf
commenced to speak in English. Hulah then came through. (For illustrations see page 265.)
I had pinned a circular piece of sooted cardboard rr-in. in diameter on the underside of
the table top. This was a surprise manoeuvre.
November 21st, l923.—Mrs. Deane complained of being very tired. After a time the
table went up very well and I pulled for a ﬂash, but no ﬂash came. I went to the ﬂasher
and struck a match to try to light the magnesium, but it had been spilt. I pulled the other
cord and got a ﬂash from a second lamp. The table kept in the air the whole time while I had
the ﬁrst failure, lit the match and pulled the second cord, quite a time. We stood again. The
table went up again, and I pulled and got a big ﬂash. The table remained up some time
after the ﬂash. In fact, the table went up very willingly this evening and remained up very
long on each occasion. I had fastened by means of drawing pins a large circular piece of
cardboard covered with soot to the underside of the table ; this is seen in the photographs.
To those who suspect fraud I would point out that the sooted cardboard renders cheating
more dlIﬁcult. (For illustrations see page 266.) For particulars of the marks which appeared
on the smoked cardboard see page 270.
January 91h, 1924.—Brown \Volf came and promised to ask somebody to put marks
on the smoked cardboard; for result (which I call the Mandarin) (Fig. No. 3, page 272.) Brown
Wolf stated that I was the cause of the non-success of my photo sittings with Mrs. Deane.
(226) January 16th, 1924.—VVe sang a hymn, as always on commencing the sittings.
There was a fair amount of light from the ﬁre. During the singing of the hymn I had been
wondering in my thoughts whether anything was being written on the cardboard while the
table was standing still. It certainly gave one a chance. The table began to tilt and spelt
out
"
No letter on table now." I told the circle what was present in my mind, and they
considered the message was an answer to my thought. By consent I turned the table up
and by the light of the ﬁre I saw there was no mark upon the cardboard.
January 23rd, 1924.—.‘\ heavy slab of beech was on the table. The table spelt out
some unrecognised name; being questioned who it was, the table tilted out
"
He was a
thought man." The table rocked about somewhat and tilted over, yet the slab remained on
the table, when by gravitation it should have fallen off.
January 30th, 1924.—Br0wn Wolf made promises of good sittings. but his promises
are very unreliable.
I brought two slates screwed together with slate pencil between them and put it outside
the fence. In some way the double slate got inside the wire fence. Then a leg of the table
bumped on the ﬂoor and the slate alternately, not smashing the slate, which one would expect
it to have done.
At a recent sitting Mrs. Deane remarked that when in a trance she got a vague idea of
what was said through her lips. \Vhen going into trance there is no heavy sighing and
travail of which one reads with other mediums; nor does Mrs. Deane show any sign
of fatigue or exhaustion after a state of trance, but she often complains the next day of
feeling unwell.
February 6th, 1924.—After the photo we sat quietly round the table and while thus sitting
some soft article struck me in the face and fell on my lap. I asked if anyone had
thrown a piece of string at me. They said
" No." VVe were all very much surprised. There
was no mention or thought of "apports." Again a similar light article was thrown in my
face. After the sitting I found four snowdrops on the ﬂoor near me. They were quite
fresh and the stems were not cut, but pulled out from the sheath. There was no exterior
moisture on them. There were no snowdrops in the room. How was my face hit in
the dark?
Page 230 Pars. (227) to (229) SEANCES
(22 7) February 27th, 1924. Weather cold; room warm with good ﬁre, which made the
room light. Large screen in front of ﬁre. Hulah, speaking through Mrs. Deane in trance,
talked to me and alluded to
“
Dicky Bird." (A very old and intimate friend of mine, Bird,
bore the nickname
" Dicky.") She complained of the cold and of the "White Stuff"
falling, which, of course, we recognised as snow, but we did not realise that it was snowing
then, as snow was not anticipated. It turned out, however, that it had been snowing heavily
during the séance. Brown Wolf then came and complained of the weather, stating that
mild weather was best for these experiments.
March 12th, 1924.—The table moved about very curiously. At one time it danced
about so boisterously, it quite startled Mr. Bird, a friend of mine who accompanied me this
evening and came continuously until August 1925. The curious thing is that during the
violent movements of the table, the biplane, which was lying quite loosely upon it, retained
its position on the table. When I stood up to cover the lenses of the cameras, I noticed a
cool breeze about my head. Mr. Bird and I remained in the room from the time we arrived
at 7- 30 until we ﬁnished, and always do so. At these sittings I often, without warning, lifted
the biplane from the table to assure myself it was loose. 0.
March 19th, 1924.——The biplane was on the table top. The table tilted at an angle of
45 to 60 degrees, yet the biplane remained in its position, although quite loose. This was
very remarkable. Hulah came through and stated that the operators at my morning
photographic experiments were none of Mrs. Deane's controls, but were some of my controls
trying experiments.
April 28th, 1924.—Three or four sittings were missed through Mrs. Deane moving to a house
in Ball's Pond Road, of which I am the owner. I arranged with her that one small room
on the ﬁrst ﬂoor, facing south, should be kept for séances and my photographic experiments.
It measures about ro-ft. wide by 16.ft. long. A plan of the room is to be seen on page 106.
The ﬁrst séance in this room was held on this date.
Mr. and Mrs. Robson occupy the top ﬂoor. They were fellow-lodgers of the Deanes for
over two years at Engleﬁeld Road. Mr. Robson plays a mouth organ at the séances very
well. Mr. and Mrs. Robson continued to attend the sittings for a. year or two.
Mrs. Deane went into trance. Brown Wolf came and gave a lot of tilting, and told
Mrs. Robson she was wearing her "Leslie " and a bell. Mrs. Robson told us she had a
portrait of her son Leslie in her pocket and the bell, and that the bell was an apport Brown
Wolf had given her some time back. It was stated by other sitters that several of them
had received apports on that occasion. This was before I joined the circle. Brown Wolf
told us to persevere. Mrs. Everitt, who had been a well-known worker in psychic circles,
came through and also told us to persevere.
(228) May 6th, l924,-Brown Wolf controlled Mrs. D. in trance. Then Hulah came
through. She said she would put a cross on my photograph on Monday next ; this was done
on May 12th (Fig. 94, page 38). Mrs. Deane stated that she was very hot. She often remarks
this at sittings when we get phenomena. It is strange that we never get raps at Mrs. Deane's
sittings, at least most rarely. Some of the sitters saw lights. I did not see any.
(" Lights never entirely fail at sittings with powerful mediums. They are usually so weak
as only to be observed in the dark, and even then only by a sensitive sight."
Eduard von Hartmann in Spiritism, p. 43.)
May 12th, 1924,_Mrs. Deane went into a trance. Brown Wolf came through and
told us that the whole circle was enclosed in a dome or funnel-shaped wall to withdraw power
from us, which they would keep and use on some future occasion, when they had devised
(229) some purpose to which they could put it. Hulah then came and spoke to me about
my walking by a stream with beautiful bulrushes. [As a matter of fact this is an out
standing episode in my youth—the only time I played truant, and took three days' leave, in
bright sunshine, walking along a stream with high bulrushes. I always regarded these as
among the happiest days of my life. It is really curious Hulah should have spoken of this.]
May I9III, 1924.—Various controls came through Mrs. Deane, among them Hulah, who
said I had a reading table at my bedside [true].
May 26th, 1924,—-Lights were seen very much this evening. F. Bird and I saw two lights
moving about, one near Mrs. Deane and one high in the air, away from Mrs. Deane. All
the others kept exclaiming about the beautiful lights they saw. Several of the sitters were
touched. Mrs. Deane went into trance. Brown Wolf came through and spoke of his
lanterns he had shown us (he calls the lights his lanterns). Then a little voice came through
giving the name
" Dudu," the guide of the Misses Moore, whom Mrs. Deane had photographed
recently at Miss Stead's. Then John (the labourer) came through, and after him Mrs. Everitt.
June 2nd, 1924.—Usual sitters, and in addition Mrs. C., a clairvoyante. Lights were
seen; Mr. Bird and I saw one each. I fancied I saw a mist in the centre of the circle.
SEANCES Fig. 362 Page 231
The other sitters also remarked on this mist. At the sittings we often notice, unanimously,
that the space about us appears light, and a little later that it is intensely black. Mrs. C.
stated that when materialisations started, or were in progress, she had a waxy exudation on
her forehead ; that her forehead was at that moment slightly so covered (greasy). She lifted
my hand to feel her forehead. Her forehead felt somewhat moist. Mrs. C. recommended
us to have a cotton cord round the circle on our laps, connecting the sitters together.
This we did at subsequent sittings as seen in one or two of the illustrations.
June 23rd, 1924.—A house-bell was sus
pended against the wall, high up away
from the sitters. The table spelt out
"
John
Warrick" (my grandfather). I asked him
whether he saw my father ; he said
"
I have
met Bob." Bob was the name my father
was called by his father and his most familiar
friends only. All the circle saw many small
lights dancing about like ﬁre-ﬂies in all
directions. The bell was rung once while I
was striking the gong, and the trumpet ﬂew
up, the narrow part resting on the table,
the wide part enclosing my right hand. The
trumpet then left that place apparently by
itself, and Mr. F. Bird, who sat on the other
side of the circle to me, received a sharp tap
on the forehead. When the sitters' hands were
on the table, the table spelt out
“
Take a
photo." I asked
"
Now ?
" and it answered
"
Yes." I pulled the string of the ﬂashlight,
but the string unfortunately broke. I moved
out in the dark and mended the string and
put more powder, as the ﬁrst was spilt.
I resumed my seat and asked the table
whetherI should try again. Answer
"
Yes."
I pulled and we got a big ﬂash (Fig. 362).
.\lrs. Deane went into trance and Brown Wolf
came through and asked how we liked his
candles (lights he meant). Asked about the
result of the photo taken, he said I was a
long time with the mending, and he did not
know whether those who inaterialised were
able to stay for the second pull. I must here state that I had quite exceptionally and
inadvertently, unknown to anyone, left the slide used on this occasion in my camera in a
corner of the séance room at the last sitting. It is of a very old-fashioned kind and the
manipulation of it is not understood by many. There is a sliding cloth or curtain in it which
requires very careful handling to prevent jamming. Before we took the photo the centre
of the circle over the table gave us the impression of a faint—a very faint—greyness, and I had
twice a cobwebby feeling on my forehead as I moved my head.
The bell was suspended high up against the wall, away from the sitters, on a cord stretched
horizontally across the room from one picture cord to the other. From this cord was sus
pended vertically a piece of sticky hospital adhesive plaster which adheres to anything
touching it. This hung over the table. The bell was rung. Mrs. Deane went into trance
and Hulah came through Mrs. Deane in trance, and said she had rung the bell, and that the
sticky stuff on the cord had not disconcerted her; she said it was Topsy who playfully hit
Mr. Bird with the trumpet.
At the commencement of the sitting the table spelt
“ LATE," but we were not later
than usual. It is a curious thing that on the smoked cardboard under the table to-day
we found at the end of the sitting a word of four letters beginning with
“
L" and ending
with
" T," viz. :
" L A I T," which we obtained also at a subsequent sitting.
June 30th, 1924.—There were many lights like little glow<worms seen by all, including
Mr. Bird and myself. The table rocked violently and the bell rang violently. The cord con
nected with it hanging down was of sticky plaster. I took a photo without warning. Nothing
suspicious found on photograph.
July 21st, 1924,—Weather warm and muggy. We saw lights. Isaw them distinctly
ﬂoating in streaks two to three inches long above Mr. Bird. The bell rang. The trumpet
had not moved to-day, and Brown Wolf stated through Mrs. Deane the cause was that we
had not put water through it.
Page 232 Fig. 363 Par. (230) SEANCE
(230) July 28th, 1924.—A wet, muggy evening. Mrs. Deane was in great form. There
were lights seen by the others, but none by Mr. Bird or myself. The bell rang once.
Mrs. Deane went into trance early in the sitting, and Brown Wolf came through, and very
soon told me to take a photo. He said he would try to put something on the table. I
pressed the button of my electric pear switch. Mrs. Deane was still in trance and, extending
from her mouth, as seen in the photo, was some white substance.
Mrs. Deane, on seeing the negative after development that same evening, exclaimed,
“ What has happened to my face? I have got a moustache !
"
Vi said, " No, that is
Mr. Bird's tie." But the print shows there is something on Mrs. Deane's mouth (Fig. 377,
page 244). Continued on next page.
August 5th, 1924. Room in darkness. I rigged up a new arrangement for the bell,
namely a bracket near the ceiling over Mr. Bird, and no string hanging down from the bell.
1 announced, having obtained Mrs. Deane's consent thereto, that as soon as the bell rang,
I should take a photograph, and I warned all present, jokingly, not to play tricks as the
photograph would expose them. The table spelt out the word
"
LAIT." We asked the
table to spell again. We again got
“
LAIT." We saw many lights. I saw one persist for a
long time ﬂoating about for some minute or more. I beat the gong; the table got very
boisterous and came over to me and made attempts to beat the gong. I held the gong in
such a way that the edge of the table could knock it so as to produce a musical sound. The
table beat the gong most vigorously. Very few hands, only those of Mrs. Robson and
Mrs. Deane were on the edge. I felt over the table to ascertain this, for the table moved
about so vigorously only those on the other side (the lower side) of the table could maintain
their hands upon it. The trumpet then got, somehow or other, on the table, and the table,
with the trumpet, beat the gong. I raised the gong to try and tempt the table to rise. The
trumpet appeared to rise as it still beat the gong.
One of the ﬁrst phenomena of this evening was the ringing of the bell in its new position.
After the séance the sooted cardboard was found to have some markings like strange
writing and drawing, and the word
"
LAIT "
distinctly written in reverse capitals. This was
the word tapped out by the table. The sooted cardboard was pinned on the under-surface
of the table (Fig. N0. 9, page 272).
August 11th. 1924.—The bell was on
the bracket above Mr. F. Bird's head, so no
one could touch it without his knowing.
0Ihe sitters expected me to ﬂash when the
bell rang. There were many pencil-shaped
lights. I saw several clearly for a full minute
each. One at ﬁrst came from above and
hovered over the table like a butterﬂy, as
though inspecting a new cover of paper
which I had pinned on to the top of the table.
One light hovered in front of my face, darting
to and fro in short ambits. We sang and I
beat the gong, and the table was very active.
It came to the gong and beat itv At one time
the table made with the gong a long series
of percussions like a rattling gun, or a peaI
of loud electric sparks, quite extraordinary_
I could not produce the same effect by holding
the gong while being sounded against the edge
of the table. The trumpet rose and tapped
everyone gently on the head, including
myself. I took a ﬂashlight photograph when
I thought the table was beating the gong with
no hands upon the table. The table spelt out
\"i was to open the shutter of the slide.
I let her do this for the second exposure,
and was then tapped on the head by the
trumpet, gently, as if with approval. After
_
I had exposed my two plates the trumpet
Fig. 363 beat the gong once. To help itself to beat
the gong the trumpet had got on to the table
by itself. Mrs. Deane went into trance and sobbed very painfully. Brown Wolf then came
through her, and on being asked said "The weeper was a woman who had seen her two children
burned in a ﬁre."
The hand of my friend of many years, Mr. I’. Bird, a solicitor, is seen groping for
the table. He was not a man to play tricks. The white line below is the cord resting on
the laps of the sitters (Fig. 363).
SEANCES Fig. 364 Page 233
Augult 18th, I924.—Present, usual seven.
Smoked cardboard pinned under table. This
evening I suspended the gong from a piece of
wood which stretched from wall to wall across
the centre of the circle. The gong was about
8-in. from the table top. I told the circle I
should ﬂash when I liked. This is a good
method of control. Soon we heard a peculiar
low hum from the gong. We saw many lights,
and I myself saw several pencil-shaped lights.
I was holding the drumstick and beating the
gong at times. The trumpet came up and
beat the gong. I ﬂashed and the photograph
shows the trumpet with one end across my
drumstick and the other free in the air. On
coming back from the camera, to which I
had gone to expose a fresh plate, I felt what
seemed like a human hand grasping the
back of mine. A sermonising spirit came
through, called John Roberts, and gave us
a dissertation on how spirits make use of
human beings with passions similar to those
the spirits had possessed on earth, inciting
human beings to the evil courses they were
addicted to themselves on earth [which seems
very unfair]. Hulah then came through
and, among other things, said there was a
spirit there, short, with red hair who wished
to punch my head as I had done him a bad
turn. I cannot recall any such person. Had
this "Bad turn
"
anything to do with an
Fig. 364 undercurrent of thought caused by my
inability that day to give a favourable
reference I had been asked for. The person, however, to whom I denied the reference was
neither short nor had he red hair. This reference refusal on my part had worried me a great
deal, and was rising in my mind from time to time.
July 28th, 1924.—Continm"d from previous page.
Brown Wolf's voice is a very strong one and rough, but does not produce the hoarseness
with Mrs. Deane one would expect were her throat made use of. Brown Wolf continued
to talk through her and said he had tried to put something on the table, but did not know
whether he had succeeded. Perhaps I missed this through a delay in the ﬂash. Mrs. Deane
came to and we continued sitting. I had my hands on my lap; something fell on to the
back of my right hand. I felt to ascertain what it was and found it was a liquid, and my
nose soon announced to me it was scent. It fell on to my hand like a blob and spread out,
reminding me of the way a single drop of melted solder spreads out when it has fallen upon
a cool, ﬂat surface. It was not a spray but a single drop. My nose is that of a trained per
fumer, and the odour was that of a single unmixed ﬂower, namely, Concrete Jasmine, used
by perfume manufacturers. It was not at all that of a scent prepared for the public, in which
the ﬂowers are always backed up with musk and other things easily recognised by an expert.
My hand still smelt after next moming's bath, and my coat smelt quite strongly of Jasmine
as recognised at my ofﬁce next morning.
Aug...‘ 25“, [924, .\1r. Bird was tapped three times on the top of his head while
singing
"
The Vicar of Bray." I felt my leg touched, and about the same time I saw a haze
about my lap. John Roberts again came through Mrs. Deane in trance, and preached to us.
Topsy spoke next, and expressed her delight at being able to play with the gong and
causeit to resound. Hulah came through. Brown Wolf came then and said John Roberts
was rather a solemn preacher. He would give him another trial, but did not approve of his
lectures; too much about bad spirits. I asked Brown Wolf whether I might take a photo
graph while he was talkiug through the medium. He said I might try; I should not be
satisﬁed unless I took a photograph. I said "Please go on talking," and while he was
talking I ﬂashed. On this plate Mrs. Deane's face looks fatter and different to the normal
Mrs. Deane (Fig. 373, page 243).
September Ist, l924.—-.\Ir. Bird received two slight taps on the top of the head while
singing his ﬁrst song. About half an hour after the opening of the sitting, a strong, heavy,
sweet odour permeated the room, of strong Jasmine it seemed to me, similar to that of a
Page 234 Pars. (231) to (233) SEANCES
previous séance. Mrs. Robson had some put on her clothes, and I also. At times the
table moved violently, and once struck Mr. Bird heavily on the chin. The trumpet rose in
the air and touched me on the left shoulder, and also on my right temple and Mr. Bird and
Mr. Robson on the forehead.
I had put a double slate screwed together and bits of pencil in between with a hole in
the corner of the upper plate. The double slate was placed under Mrs. Robson's chair.
The hole in the corner was to allow the ectoplasm (?) to get inside. After the close of the
sitting we found "Good Night
"
and
"
B.W." [Brown Wolf] separately on the inside
surface of the lower slate, an inch or more away from the hole. The slates were still
screwed together by two screws, one at either end.
September 8th, I924,—There were several lights, thin, about 3-in. or 4-in. long, always
vertical. I saw many, one for half a minute, also Mr. Bird saw them. “y cameras were
in position. As already stated, I may ﬂash without warning. Mrs. Deane went into trance
early and spoke as Brown Wolf. Brown Wolf told me to take a photograph to show his
friend helping him. I said
" Do you mean, take it now ?
"
He said
“
Yes." I said "At
once ?
"
Again he said
"
Yes." 1 got a good negative, showing some white material lying
ﬂat on Mrs. Deane's head, and something like a moustache under her nose (Fig. 378, page 244).
There is also something white inside Mr. Bird's left coat sleeve and some white under his
hands. Mr. Bird was partly in the cabinet. Mr. Bird is a retired solicitor and an old friend
of mine. He states he had no handkerchief up his sleeve, nor anything white under his hands.
The ﬂash had no effect on Mrs. Deane, who was talking as Brown Wolf up to my ﬂashing,
and continued to talk as Brown Wolf afterwards. John Roberts came and bade us farewell,
as he said his remarks were not appreciated. Hulah came through and said there was
something on the smoked cardboard, but she did not think there was anything on the slates.
We found afterwards that she was right.
September 15th, 1924.—There were many touches during the sitting. Mrs. Robson
said a quite solid person stood by her. Mr. Robson stated that the trumpet crawled all
round his neck. Mrs. Deane went into trance and spoke as Brown Wolf, and, speaking as
Brown Wolf, allowed me to take a photograph. He said he protected his medium from the
ﬂash. The ﬂash did not wake her and she continued to talk as Brown Wolf. There were
a lot of small separate marks found on the sooted cardboard ﬁxed on the underside of the
table-top, like shorthand characters. I had smoked the cardboard myself, with Mr. Bird's
help, just previous to the sitting. At the beginning of the sitting I saw whitish clouds over
the table.
(231) September 23rd, 1924,—Mrs. Deane went into trance. Hulah spoke through her.
She asked me whether I had heard my factory cat
"
Tabby." I did not hear it, but Mr. Bird
and some of the others heard a cat mewing. [As a matter of fact my factory cat
"
Tabby
"
had been put away by us recently, but this had not been mentioned by me.]
(232) October 7th, 1924,—Weather wet. The usual apparatus, table, wire fence, smoked
cardboard, double slate, bell and gong. The table was in the centre of the circle. We had
sundry good lights, and one especially brilliant cross about 5-in. X 2-in. I saw this distinctly
for some time. Mrs. Deane went into trance. Topsy came, then Peter Riley, then Hulah,
who said I should have a great surprise within two weeks. [This turned out to be true.]
Brown Wolf came through and said there were many high spirits there that night from
higher spheres. They brought the luminous cross. I was patted on the knee, and Mr. Bird
also. He sat on the opposite side of the circle to myself. Mr. Robson said he was touched
on the head.
(233) October I4th, 1924.—There were lights, the trumpet was thrown about and
struck Mr. Robson on the head. I got a tap on the head from the trumpet. Mrs. Deane
went into trance. Peter Riley came through ﬁrst. He said great preparations were being
made for Armistice Day; the boys were all posing themselves in position. Vi was to
accompany her mother on Armistice Day, as they wanted to get some faces on her plates.
Topsy came through and spoke about Armistice Day and nurses. Then Hulah came and
explained that Topsy meant they would try to get a border or frame of nurses round the
Armistice picture. I told Hulah that I had had a great surprise on Saturday last. It was
a most unexpected communication leading to one of my nephews resigning his connection
with the company of which I am the chairman. I had no inkling of this possibility. At
the previous sitting Hulah had told me I should have a great surprise. I asked Brown \‘Volf
whether I might take a photograph. He said I should not get anything but the medium's
face-drawn up. Brown Wolf laughed and said I had had a surprise, and had indeed given
his medium a surprise (by the ﬂash). Another instance of Mrs. Deane remaining in trance
after the ﬂash.
SEANCES Pars. (234) (234a) Figs. 365, 366 Page 235
October 21st, 1924.—l\lrs. Deane went into trance. Peter Riley came through and
preached a bit, and spoke about the coming Armistice Day, and said that the boys on the
other side were in a state of great excitement about it. He said there should be no sittings
until after the Armistice, as they wished to store up the power.
November 18th, 1924.—The table spelt out
"
Page Io no good." On the smoked
cardboard under the table we found number Io written. Mrs. Deane went into trance.
Topsy came, then Brown Wolf. Brown Wolf stated that the faces on the Armistice photo-
graph of this month were not footballers, etc., as had been stated by the newspapers.
December 2nd, 1924,—Mrs. Deane unwell. Brown Wolf came through Mrs Deane and
said that the letter
"
S
"
on my photographic plates and papers represents the initial letter of
an operator's name.o
(234) December 91h, 1924.-—During this evening's sitting while I held the gong above
the table and beat it, something tapped me two or three times on my hand holding the
strap of the gong. I concluded it was the trumpet, as directly after that the narrow end of
the trumpet was applied to my lips. The trumpet also hit the gong. We heard Topsy's
voice, not through Mrs. Deane this time. Topsy stated through Mrs. Deane that she spoke
through the trumpet and tried to put the trumpet into my mouth. This was the best
Direct voice we had had. Topsy gave by Direct voice replies to my remarks to her. Brown
Wolf came through Mrs. Deane. I asked him to bring some scientists and philosophers to
the meeting ; he said
"
Only humble spirits come to humble people."
(2340) Comment.—Vile are none of us clever or gifted at these Deane séances, as are those
who attended the Bradley sittings. This remark of Brown Wolf's is therefore very
signiﬁcant as giving the reason for the absence of intellectual productions at our sittings.
("It is remarkable that the intellectual and moral level of these messages corresponds
in a curious way with the tone of the circle—frivolous and foolish sitters get frivolous
and foolish
0
messages.' This has caused some persons to attribute all such messages to
the subconsciousness, a theory which, however, does not cover a large body of facts such
as prediction."

Brown Wolf spoke of the
“

mark which comes so frequently on the materials of my
morning experiments with Mrs. Deane. He said "S "
was a very important personage,
both in the spirit world and previously in this world, and I must consider myself highly
favoured to have him working for me. He added some particulars which I am not to
divulge. He seemed chagrined that he had said so much, for he said I could identify him
(" S ") from the details given. I was not to try.
" S

January 61h, 1925.—.Topsy spoke in the Direct voice and Brown Wolf spoke through
the trumpet. Mrs. Deane went into trance. Topsy came ﬁrst and said she would put some
stuff on my bald head which I should not like at all; it would be difﬁcult to get it off. (I had
begged her to do this.) While Brown Wolf was talking I said I was going totake a photo
graph. He said
"
You can if you like, but do not blame me if you waste a plate." I ﬂashed.
The ﬂash did not affect the medium. She continued to talk as Brown Wolf (Fig. 375, page 243).
(235) January 130:, 1925.—Usual apparatus. A deep voice joined in a note or two through
the trumpet during one of the songs. It was a man named John, a farm hand, who directly
afterwards came through Mrs. Deane in trance. Topsy came through next and said she had
scratched my table. We found a few marks on the smoked cardboard. In a photograph
I took last week of Mrs. Deane in trance, while she was speaking as Brown Wolf, her upper
lip is seen puckered up in ridges (Fig. 375, page 243). Shortly afterwards in the daylight I
asked Mrs. Deane to pucker up her lips, and I observed the same ridges. She said this was
how she would put out her lips when whistling.
(236) January 27th. 1925.—-Usual apparatus. Many lights, I saw several high up. The
trumpet moved in the air and came on to the gong. Mrs. Deane said she was touched by
some form, as also was Mrs. Robson. The table danced about vigorously during the singing
and synchronised therewith. Topsy joined quite a long time by Direct voice in chorus of
" The Three Jolly Postboys." The sound appeared to come from the ceiling.
(237) February 3rd, 1925.—Apparatus as usual. Topsy joined in the singing, apparently
through the trumpet. Brown Wolf professes to be the producer of the lights, or candles,
as he calls them. Hulah came through and said the ﬂowers and jewels were lovely on the
other side and went into ecstasies over the beautiful colours in the Spirit World.
(238) February 17th, 1925.—The room was cold and draughty. Hulah came through and
said if we felt cold and uncomfortable we could not expect much. There was some scribbling
on the closed slates inside. The heads of the screws had been covered with stamped paper
by me, so that the slates could not have been opened.
(239) February 24th, I925.—The room was warm. The table became boisterous. Mrs. D.
saw lights and materialisations, and once she said she saw a form near the cabinet. Several
sitters said they were touched. Early in the evening I felt on my head something like a
soft brush or a pad of cotton wool, and, following that. a cool sensation on the left half of
my bald head as if some liquid were poured over it, and it seemed to run down my temple
towards my eye. I then felt strokes of a narrow brush on my head in several directions.
Shortly after this Topsy spoke through Mrs. Deane and was very hilarious, chuckling over
her success in evading the others, that is (she said) the other spirits who would prevent her
from playing tricks with me. From what she said we gathered she had marked my head
very much more than turned out to be the case. As a matter 01 fact there were two parallel
lines from side to side and four curved lines crossing them at right angles, of a brown colour.
All these lines are about }-in. apart. Immediately I realised what was going on I put my
left hand up between Mrs. Deane and myself and felt nothing, but the action ceased I then
felt for and found Mrs. Deane's hands on the table. Of course I sit considerably higher than
Mrs. Deane and 3-ft. away from her, and it was certainly impossible for Mrs. Deane to carry
out this painting in the dark. Besides, I always have my camera in situ and can ﬂash when
ever I like. She could not have found my head in the dark. I asked Topsy what she used
to paint my head with. She said she had obtained some of the material employed by those
who mark the papers at my morning sittings with Mrs. Deane. A little later on in the sitting
I felt a soft brush over my face. Topsy promised to mark Mr. Bird's forehead on a future
occasion. Hulah came through and was very concerned about Topsy's conduct. Hulah
said my grandfather, John VVarrick, was present and was very pleased with my thankfulness
for services he had rendered to the family, as praise was always welcome. [As a matter of
fact 1 do thank him sometimes in my bedroom in a kind of prayer, on the off-chance of his
being in a spirit world (no one in the world besides myself knew this) for the great service
he rendered us all (he founded my business).] He stated I had not got the hang of the
photographs yet. He was very interested in my experiments and would try to impress me
what to do. He said he was happy and occupied himself in growing plants, and was trying
to grow a tree the juice of which would cure an ailment humanity was much afflicted with.
He would later try to introduce this to our world. [ It is a fact that my grandfather's hobby
on retirement was planting and tending an orchard on his land. He imported some fruit
trees. He was a drug merchant]

March 3rd, l925.—Apparatus as usual, in addition I brought a small tambourine with
the parchment painted luminously on both sides. \Vhile we were singing the opening hymn
l felt two strokes as if of a sponge on the left side of my bald head, the side near Mrs. Deane.
Mrs. Deane and I are separated some distance
in order to leave a clear space for my camera
to take a view of the table and the centre of
circle. Mrs. Deane and I have to stretch
to join hands. I felt immediately for
Mrs. Deane's hands and found them quietly
on the table. Topsy came through Mrs. Deane
very early and was under the impression she
had put something on my head. She said
she had come very early to avoid the
obstructionists. Then Brown Wolf came
through and said
"
Take a photograph."
I was taken by surprise and was rather slow
in pulling the cord. Brown Wolf said he
hoped we had got a picture of the ectoplasm
used in moving the table. He was not sure,
but had done his best. The photograph, on
developing and printing, shews a vertical
white band descending from the table near
Mrs. Deane (Fig. 367). Brown Wolf continued
to talk just as though I had not ﬂashed.
This insensibility of Mrs. Deane in trance to
the ﬂash is very remarkable. There were many
lights seen by the others but none by Mr. Bird
and myself. In answer to a question Brown
Fig. 367 Wolf had said previously that Topsy had got
her liquid from the other side, and that the mysterious "S" got his material sometimes from
the other side, sometimes from this. Brown Wolf stated that "S " would give his name
later. Does the
“
Sergent VIT "
p. 215, represent his name ?
(240) March 101k, 1925.—Early in the sitting Topsy rapped through the table
“
Photograph top of head." Shortly afterwards I felt two distinct strokes as of a sponge
on my left temple, the side nearest Mrs. Deane. Mrs. Deane was a good yard away from
me. I am perfectly certain Mrs. Deane did not carry out this work. There was no searching
at all. The two strokes were very slow and deliberate. I put my left arm up and felt nothing.
There was a feeling of moisture with the strokes. About a quarter of an hour afterwards
I felt two more deliberate strokes on the left top of my head. Vi was on my right. I felt
her chair, it was in advance of mine. I should certainly have noticed any movement either
on her part or that of Mrs. Deane. The
two last strokes were quite slow and felt
wet and spongy like the others. The
marks made are seen in the illustration
(Fig. 369). When lightly touched by
Mrs. Deane and Mrs. Gilbert the table
beat the gong. At one period when no
one was touching the table it jumped
right over the wire netting, landing
near me (Fig. 368). I put it back within
the fence and it moved about towards
me. I ﬂashed. The illuminated
tambourine was moved from the
horizontal to a vertical position. The
trumpet, which was between Mrs. Deane
and myself, and had a detector on it.
rose into the air, touched my right-hand
neighbour and landed further away again
from Mrs. Deane. Topsy said she did not
get the right stuff last time for painting
my head, but hoped she had succeeded
to-night. Topsy said she got the colouring
stuff from the other side from Mr.
“
S's
"
materials. I asked her where she got this
_ _ sponge from. She said she put the colour
Flg- 368 1718- 359 on with her ﬁngers, not a sponge. The
colour remained on my head for a week
If the brown marks could be Put on the Papers, glass, etc., as shown in chaper VII it
seems not improbable that such marks could be put on my head.
Page 238 Fig. 370 Par. (241) SEANCES
April 7th, I925.—Weather ﬁne. We had a non-luminous electric stove in the room.
\Ne had some lights of a new character outside the circle like sheet lightning, lasting barely
a few seconds, quite unlike the usual pencil lights we get. We had on the ﬂoor a loop of
cord which was prepared by my brother, a nautical man ; the ends were spliced and knotted
and there were two of his seals upon it. W0 were anxious to obtain a knot in the single cord
of the loop, which cannot be done normally, but we have not obtained it. Mrs. Deane went
into trance and Brown Wolf came through ﬁrst. A message had come through the table
from a Peter Wright, who said (we understood) that he was dealing with the looped cord.
Brown Wolf disclaimed any knowledge of this Peter Wright and any interest in the cord.
He said his business was the lighted candles. He promised me ectoplasm next sitting.
He had his doubts whether it would stand the ﬂash. I was to take a photograph when
instructed. Topsy came through “rs. Deane and chatted as usual. We asked her to fetch
Hulah as I-Iulah had not been for one or two sittings. Hulah then came through and told
us she was at a college being spiritually educated. The result was we got a platitudinous
sermon from her.
April 14th, I925.—Very early in the sitting we had some more of those strong, bright
lights outside the circle near the camera. The sitters were touched a good deal several times
on the top of the head, as if by a soft ball, and again on the forehead. I was touched on
the top of the head two consecutive touches, as if from a soft small ball, and later I was
struck two resounding blows on the head by the trumpet. The looped cord, which was
behind Mrs. Deane, hanging behind the ﬁre-screen, was thrown on to my lap.
April 2ht, 1925.-—Somc glow-worm lights were seen. The table Jumped about
vigorously from one leg to the other. Brown Wolf came through Mrs. Deane early
and said I wanted a photograph, did I not ?
I said of ectoplasm. He said he would try
ectoplasm, but would not promise any result.
I was to ﬂash at once. The ﬁrst ﬂash failed,
but I got another, which shows on develop
ment a white mass from Mrs. Deane's lap
to the ground [of course, of no value as
evidence] on two plates, one a half-plate, the
other a quarter-plate through a quartz lens
(Fig- 370)
April 27th, 1925,—We changed over to
Monday for sittings to accommodate a new
sitter, Mrs. Cuthbert, to replace the Robsons.
Mrs. Deane stated that Mrs. Cuthbert is very
psychic and is a spiritualist. The trumpet,
in response to my request that it should hit
us all, did so, and one could, by means of the
detector attached to it. see it ﬂying about all
over the table. Mrs. Everitt came through.
Mrs. Cuthbert, who knew Mrs. Everitt in
life, said the voice and manner were un
(241) doubtedly Mrs. Everitt's. Brown Wolf
said Ishould have a fat envelope. When I got
home, I found a very fat sealed envelope had
F.
arrived for me. [An unusual thing to receive
ls- 370 such an envelope at my private address]
May 4th, 1925.—This evening there were some large lights,- I saw several of about
12-in. X4-in., very bright, chieﬂy under the table. Mr. Bird saw several, especially a large
light of the shape of an isosceles triangle about 8-in. X 4-in. Mrs. Cuthbert also saw it; it
was hovering in front of the camera as if to impress the plate, which, however, on development,
was blank. I had been asking for a triangle at my previous morning sitting, A triangular
mark came on the smoked cardboard as well to-night. The trumpet rose in the air and hit
several sitters, giving me a resounding blow on the top of my head. There was a good deal
of white haze about and above the table this evening.
May 11th, I925.—Pencils of light appeared and we got some bright summer
lightning kind of lights. The trumpet went round the room and hit me on the head and
hit others. During the sitting I put out my hand to feel for the table; I could not ﬁnd
SEANCES Pars. (242) to (247) Fig. 371 Page 239
it; the others then put their hands forth,
and we discovered that the table had been
removed noiselessly from within the wire
fence. and without touching anyone. It was
found between me and the camera. This
manoeuvre could not have been carried out
by a sitter in the dark without my detecting
it ; besides, I may ﬂash at any time without
warning. While I was beating the gong, it
was struck by some hard, metallic body
several times. I raised the gong higher and
higher. It kept on being struck by the
metallic body ; at least it gave out a metallic
sound such as a poker would produce. I raised
the gong as high as I could reach and then
I ﬂashed. The sitters were startled and Mrs.
Deane raised her hands high in the air. Her
hands were holding the rope and its violent
movement is seen in the photograph. The
photographic print shows nothing striking
the gong. (Fig. 371.) The illuminated tam
bourine was shaken, accompanying some of
the singing quite well. Some of the sitters
saw the tambourine moving. The bell
hanging just above Mr. Bird's head was
(242) rung. There were scrawls on the sooted
cardboard and on the double slate inside;
these latter were small shorthand-like marks.
The slate was closed with two of my labels
_ which I had initialled, and which I found
Fig. 37r

intact at the end of the sitting.
May 25M, 1925,—The trumpet touched us all and gave me a resounding blow on the
head. Something hit me in the centre of the face and fell down. On reaching to the ﬂoor
I found it was my brother's cord, which I had placed on the ﬂoor as usual. On examining
it afterwards in the light, I found that the looped end was a mass of knots, very tight.
Mrs. Deane went into trance. Brown Wolf addressed me and said
"
You would like to take
a photograph." I said
" Certainly." I then asked him whether the rod which shows against
my legs on last week's photograph was a psychic rod. (Fig. 371). He said it was, and
that he would try to give me a similar rod to-day, but it might not stand the light. He told me
to take a photograph immediately. I ﬂashed, the result shows nothing psychic, but the
trumpet is standing on the table, whereas it was originally on the ﬂoor. After the ﬂash
Mrs. Deane continued to talk as Brown Wolf. She stated afterwards she was not aware
that I had ﬂashed.
(243) As regards the knot in the cord, it was not a knot in a single cord. It was at the
end of the loop and was a very unusual kind of knot, most skilfully made. Icould not
imitate it. It was really a very interesting knot. Next Sunday I took it to my brother
a nautical man, who understands all about knots, and he was most interested in it. The
double cord was so folded about on itself as to make a neat tight bulky crown, and no loop
end of the cord was visible.
(244) Topsy sang through the trumpet a note or two, and also joined in the chorus of
"
Piccanini
"
by direct voice away from Mrs. Deane.
(245) June 8th, 1925.—Usual sitters; also, a Mrs. Marr. Many lights this evening.
Mrs. Deane had the feeling that a materialised form was standing near her. In fact, she
asked me whether I had left my seat and was standing near her. Topsy spoke to us in
Direct voice.
(246) June 15th, 1925—Usual sitters. The table tilted the following message
" Mr. Tom
was not to sell land." Mr. Tom, a nephew of mine, had bought a piece of land "on spec,"
and the message was very applicable. No one in the room, other than myself, knew anything
about this. The table told me to take a photograph ; I ﬂashed, and got a good photograph,
but nothing abnormal on it.
(247) June 29th, 1925.—I was touched twice on my ﬁnger-tips seemingly by ﬁngers.
Brown Wolf came through Mrs. Deane; he addressed himself to
" Warrick," and said I
should ﬁnd something I wanted in the bottom drawer of the chest at the foot of my bed.
In preparing the séance room we had darkened the window for the ﬁrst time with a
Page 240 Pars. (248) to (250) SEANCES
new frame covered with American oilcloth. \V1: had discussed a good deal the best method
of stopping the light showing round the edges. [On going to the bottom drawer indicated,
I found very few things in it, but among them were four long sandbags full of sand which
I had used some years ago to stop draughts from my windows; had I wanted them I should
not have known where to search for them ; certainly not in that drawer. There seems to be
some connection with these and the question raised as to the best method of excluding the
light from the edges of the window-shutter.]
(248) July 61h, 1925,—I obtained a photograph of Mrs. Deane talking as Brown Wolf.
We had two Direct voices; Topsy especially good and prolonged, and the table moved of
its own accord, projecting itself right out of the wire fence to a spot near the camera. At
one time, too, it moved itself completely over. There were strong lights about the size of
hazel nuts.
(249) July 13th, 1925,—Mrs. Cuthbert went "otI "
and her guide "Sunﬂower" came through
her, and conversed with Topsy speaking through Mrs. Deane. Topsy suggested to her the
bringing of a big plant into the room in a pot with earth and placing it on the table, and
asked
“
Sunﬂower
" to help her. I suggested that I should photograph the plant and they
should take it away again. (See report of 28th September sitting.) During this conversation
the cord was thrown into my lap. I held
10f
out taut in the dark by both bands in front
of
me
and
it
was plucked once or twice.
(249a) July 20th, 1925.—The knotted cord was ﬂung at Mrs. Cuthhcrt and was afterwards
found to have what we called a Crown Knot. similar to the previous one, very tight and not
at all easy to make. See (140), page 178, and (243). Page 239.
(2495) August 17th, 1925.~Topsy came through Mrs. Deane. Mr. Bird had died this
month. Topsy said to me
I
should have to do my own writing in future. [No one, other
than myself, knew that Mr. Bird always wrote out these reports to my dictati0n.] We have
a
ring of rope all round the circle, held by the sitters' hands. There was an empty chair
where Mr. Bird used to sit, and at one time the rope rapped repeatedly on it, although
Mrs. Gilbert and Mrs. Cuthbert on either side of the chair held the rope ﬁrmly and still.
(249c) August 31st, 1925.—Topsy told the circle
I took some drink of an evening from
a cupboard, and adrink when
I
went to bed. [This is very true, a habit
I
have lately
adopted] This was said by Topsy in a hantering way. Topsy seems to know many things
about my rooms.
'
(249:!) September 7th, 1925.-—The wish to-day, on my suggestion, was that the trumpet
should rise and hit me on the head.
I
had prepared
a
special piece of apparatus which
I
wore on my head, the striking of which should produce a ﬂash and a photograph.
Mrs. Deane
is
frightened at my electric contraptions, fearing an accident to myself, which
would be laid at her door.
I
cannot remove this fear from her mind. When
I
explained
to the sitters what
I
hoped would occur, namely. that the trumpet would rise and strike my
head, Mrs. Deane said, " No,
I
hope the trumpet will not go up.
"
The trumpet had
a
strip of luminous paper round it. The trumpet rose and gave the apparatus on my head
a
resounding blow. Unfortunately, there was no ﬂash. After striking me the trumpet ﬂoated
at great speed round the circle on the level of our hands, striking others. It was
a
great
sight, the luminous band made its movement quite visible. The luminous tambourine
moved at times, keeping tune with Mr. Robson's mouth organ. While
I
was holding the
head apparatus between my knees, the trumpet struck
it
and produced a ﬂash. Towards
the end Topsy came through Mrs. Deane and got into
a
very depressed mood, and cried and
would not be consoled.
(I
myselfwas depressed in spirits on account of
a
letter
I
had received
in the morning.)
(250) September 14th, I925.—Weather coldish. Mrs. Deane not in good humour
,
she told us she had had no sleep. We formed a circle of hands and sang. There was a
slight movement of the tambourine. Brown Wolf came through and said
" You want to
take a photograph,
I
will show you something. Be quick." My apparatus failed me.
Brown Wolf kept saying
"
I
cannot keep the power, be quick." The tambourine rose in the
air near Mrs. Deane for the ﬁrst time, and ﬂoated in my neighbourhood.
I
explored the
neighbourhood of the tambourine with my left hand and grasped what seemed to be
a
solid
arm.
I
did not clasp
it
but just closed my ﬁngers and thumb on it. The tambourine
immediately fell. My hand and the arm parted company. The tambourine was high up
near me. Had the object
I
touched been a normal arm
I
should surely have detected the
movement of somebody belonging to it as the tambourine was high up and near me. We
had a great amount of movement of the tambourine and trumpet to-day and touching. The
trumpet hit Mr. Robson on the brow and the head a good whack, and many other blows.
After the termination of the sitting the tambourine ﬂoated and was placed on Mrs. Cuthbert's
head. As Vi rose from her chair the chair rose with her, and the chair and Vi went back on
the ﬂoor with much noise. On lighting up
I
noticed
a
piece of cotton wool as large as a small
cigar, say 3&-in. X§-in., standing up vertically from the valley between Mrs. Deane's knot of
hair behind and the hair on top of her head.
I
remarked upon
it
aloud. Mrs. Deane said
SEANCES Par. (251) Fig. 372 Page 241
it must have remained from some cotton wool used by her to ﬁx on to her head a hat too
large for her. It is strange no one noticed it before the sitting commenced, as Mrs. Deane
was in her chair quite a time before the light was put out, and the others were sitting round
while I was working on my electric ﬂash contraption. As Mrs. Deane is short and the others
taller, one fancies the piece of cotton wool would have been observed. It is true it was at
the back of her head and when I discovered it I was standing in her neighbourhood while
she was sitting.
Comment.—I mention the cotton wool because of the photographs obtained in September,
1024, see p. 244 which so obviously suggest cotton wool. As regards the arm incident it is
one of those indecisive things which are the bane of experiments in the dark.
Mr. Robson had stated at one sitting that the tin trumpet at one time touched his
eyelid quite gently. He stated that at the sitting to-day the cardboard trumpet beat time
to the music on his eyelid. The movements of the trumpet and tambourine were the best
we have had, and could not have been effected fraudulently. Mrs. Deane told me, on the
next day (Tuesday) at my photographic sitting with her, that she felt a hand touch her hand
on her lap, a human hand, and asked whether I had touched her. Was this the eIfect of
my touching the member holding the tambourine in the air ? But Mrs. Deane stated that
Mrs. Robson also felt her hand was touched.
September 2ht, 1925.—Usual complete circle. Weather coldish. No table in centre.
Trumpet, tambourine, cardboard slate, looped cord in centre. We had a persistent glow
worm-like light early; it ﬂoated about and came quite close to my face. It was a single
streak, vertical, about {in. in length. It seemed to keep perpendicular. The tambourine
beat time on the ﬂoor and rose iii-in. or so close to me. Mrs. Deane went into trance early
and
"
Snowball," a medicine man of the same tribe as Brown Wolf, came through her and
talked. Mrs. Deane, as
" Snowball," left her seat and went to Mrs. Robson and massaged
her, and then massaged my head (to produce hair ?). She then went to Mrs. Cuthbert and
massaged her; then to Mr. Robson, and then massaged one of Vi's legs for rheumatism.
She, as
" Snowball," made a noise all the time with guttural sounds as if speaking a strange
language. I asked Brown Wolf whether I might take a photograph; he complied, but
said I should not get anything. I asked him to look towards me ; I ﬂashed and got a good
negative with Mrs. Deane's upper lip puckered up as before (Fig. 374, page 243). We got some
direct singing by Brown Wolf this evening while we were singing, but not very much.
(251) September 28th, 1925.—Weather cool and damp and overclouded. I arrived fairly
early and found the room ready, all chairs placed in position. Vi Deane and I were there
a quarter of an hour with electric light on. Vi Deane put the candlestick on the ﬂoor in the
centre of the circle of chairs and I focussed on the candle ﬂame. As it happened, I had no
black cloth with me and so looked about the room for a cover, and found a small black
table-cover. (This is important on account of what happened later.) The candle was placed
on Mrs. Deane's chair and I focussed it there,
as I usually do before the sitting. I could see
well under the chairs all the time as I walked
about the room. Had there been anything un
familiar to me in the room I should certainly
have observed it, as it is a very small room
(see plan, page r06). Mrs. Deane sat with her
back to the cabinet (not the dark.room),
Mrs. Robson was on her left, with her back
close against the door. I do not think the
door was locked, but one could not open the
door without Mrs. Robson's knowledge, nor
without our observing it owing to some light
coming in from the passage, which is lighted
by a small window. Besides, there was a tall
three-fold screen against the door to prevent
draught. Mrs. Deane went into trance.
Brown Wolf came through at once and said
"You want to take photograph now." I got
a good ﬂash and Brown Wolf said, "Good
photograph." It shows an apport (P) and
Mrs. Deane talking as Brown \Volf. Then
, Topsy came, then "Snowball," the medicine
F18- 372 man, came through, and Mrs. Deane as
"Snowball" left her seat and massaged Mrs. Robson. She then gropcd past Vi to me, and
massaged my head.
On account of my noticing the cotton wool on Mrs. Deane's head at the séance of
September 14th, or being unaccountably impressed to the action (of course, I knew not what
the photograph would show) I determined to look inside the cabinet immediately after the
sitting. As an excuse for doing so I said
"
I will put the gong away," and I put the gong in
Page 242 Pars. (252) (253) SEANCES
the cabinet, and while doing so I had a good look round. As regards the dark-room my half
plate camera with wide-spreading tripod prevented all access to that. I had brought the
half-plate already loaded that afternoon by my clerk. I had also taken the lens with me to
the sitting. I took the slide home with me and developed the plate that evening. On
examination the print shows a difference in light on the two sides. The side occupied by
Mrs. Deane and Mrs. Robson is obviously lighter than the other. In all my other photo
graphs taken with a similar ﬂashlight, the illumination has been fairly equal all over the
plate. On the ﬂoor in a position in front of Mrs. Deane's left foot and Mrs. Robson's right
foot is seen a ﬂower-pot with a fern reaching up to Mrs. Deane's knee (Fig. 372, page 241).
From my knowledge of Mrs. Robson I am sure she would not have shared in any trickery.
She is transparently a believer in the spiritualistic theory of these phenomena. One cannot
regard this apport as absolutely evidential, but I cannot conceive that the ﬂower-pot, with
the ﬂower, could have been brought into the room and removed from it without discovery.
In addition one must remember the great risk run by anyone tricking through my having
control of the ﬂashlight and the power and the will to ﬂash without warning. When
Mrs. Deane moved to massage Mrs. Robson and myself the ﬂower-pot with the fern seen in
the photograph could hardly have been in the position shown in the photograph, as, had it
been, it would assuredly have been knocked down by Mrs. Deane.
See report of July r 3th last (page 240) where mention is made of a project to apport a.
plant, and my request that it should be taken away after I had photographed it.
Comment—It is also possible that the ﬂower-pot with fern is a photographic Extra. Extras
of ﬂowers and birds have appeared on many psychic photographs, but the light on that
side of the plate is against this theory.
(252) October 13th, 1925.—Usual sitters. Mrs. Deane complained of feeling very tired ;
the sitting was very poor in results. Topsy came through Mrs. Deane and asked me what
I was doing with the little black things in the box (I had been, that day, experimenting
with packing licorice pellets in tins, certainly unknown to any of the circle except myself).
Brown Wolf came through and was quite surly with me when I asked whether I might take
a photograph. He said if I had been quicker last time I should have obtained a much larger
plant on the photo. It was difﬁcult for them to keep anything for any length of time. He
said that the plant was not an apport, but a materialisation from the other side.
(253) October 19th, 1925.—Usual circle. Weather wet and cold ; Mrs. Deane very
quiet ; a poor sitting. Brown Wolf came through. He was rather subdued and said bad
weather prevented phenomena. They could not push the veiling through the thick, humid
atmosphere. Brown Wolf said, this evening, that the ﬂower-pot fern came from a shop in
the Essex Road, that is, that it was an apport. (At the last sitting he said it was not an
apport.) Hulah came through and talked quite a lot; gave Mrs. Robson a message not
to worry. She told Mr. Robson he had a bright time in front of him. [As a matter of fact,
after two years of unemployment, he obtained temporary work for Christmas and early in
1926 a permanent position with the G.P.O.]
October 26th, 1925.—Usual circle. Weather wet. Good lights seen by me as well as
by the rest of the circle. One light lasted fully a minute. As usual I had control of the
ﬂash apparatus and could ﬂash at any time. The double cardboard frame, similar to a
double slate, the slates being replaced by white cardboards, was lifted from the ﬂoor and
fell on to Mrs. Cuthbert's lap and thence on to the ﬂoor with a great noise.
November 2nd, 1925.—Usual circle. Weather dampish. The slate moved and touched
my hand at the height of my knee. The trumpet hit me broad-end-on above the mouth.
I was singing lustily and the trumpet movement seemed designed to put the trumpet over
my mouth. The tambourine jumped on to Mrs. Cuthbert's lap while photograph was being
taken by me, and shows itself there in the print. Brown \Nolf came through and told me
to take a photograph. I ﬂashed and Brown Wolf was still talking. He told us to sing.
He continued talking after the ﬂash. Brown Wolf said he was very sad as the Armistice
photographic arrangements had been taken out of his hands by a higher spirit, a black man,
and Brown Wolf feared it would be bungled. Brown Wolf was quite distressed. [As a
matter of fact Mrs. Deane's Armistice photography was a failure this year.‘
November 16th, 1925.—Usual circle present ; weather very cold. We had no table in the
centre and no wire fence. I put the electric stove in the centre, the cardboard slate, the
tambourine, and the trumpet, all in the centre. Mrs. Deane sat just outside the cabinet.
The lady sitters remarked upon the many good lights; I saw one or two pencils of light
about r-in. long, hardly like pencils this time, in the neighbourhood of Mr. Robson; they
remained about a minute. Many of the sitters recorded being touched. While we were
holding hands (I was holding Mrs. Cuthbert's right hand, and Mrs. Gilbert had hold of
Mrs. Cuthbert's left hand) Mrs. Cuthbert's hair comb was slowly and gently pulled out of
her hair. (No one could have got behind Mrs. Cuthbert while the act was taking place,
the back of her chair was against the wall.) She said
"
They are pulling my comb out i
"
A second after that it fell on the ground behind her.
My camera is always in position with cap 05 in readiness should I desire to ﬂash.

1926.—-Ab0ut twenty sittings were held. The last one was on july i9th, when the séances
terminated. In 1929 a new series was commenced at my rooms as reported on pages 247,
267 and 268.
At the i926 séances the usual phenomena occurred with the trumpet ; tambourine, and
bell, etc., the only other happenings of interest were the following :—
January [MIL—The cardboard trumpet struck me a whacking blow on my head. The
room was perfectly dark. How was my head found so accurately ? The trumpet stayed a
few seconds on my chest. I ought to have ﬂashed, but did not. The trumpet touched each
sitter gently in turn. On my requesting the luminous tambourine to ﬂoat it jumped on to
my knee. The bell rang vigorously several times.
March Isn—The sitters this evening and during this year were mostly Mrs. Deane, Vi,
Mrs. Cuthbert, Mrs. Robson, Mr. Brightwell, Mrs. Brightwell (both spiritualists) and myself.
I introduced to‘day, without any warning, a new piece of apparatus, which I designate
the
"
automatic ﬂasher." For description of this see page 223. The trumpet was dislodged
on this occasion from the platform by some means or other twice during the sitting, and
produced, automatically, two ﬂashes yielding two photographs (Figs. 381, 382). Ido not
know whether the trumpet was raised or pushed off. I found it could be pushed off, as I had
not then made a fence round the platform to prevent this side movement of the trumpet.
It is certain, however, that no one had time before the light was turned out to grasp the
possibilities of fooling with the trumpet, and as I used the strong 240 volt house current,
and the terminals were bare, and as the sitters were very apprehensive anent the electric
current, no one is likely to have gropcd about the apparatus in the dark.
Fig. 381 Fig. 382
One picture shows the trumpet on the ﬂoor. It must have dragged the weight with it
for ﬂashes to have been caused. As far as I can learn from control experiments, no one
could have produced these eﬂects without his or her action being betrayed in the resulting
instantaneous photographs. Later on I put a barrier of six skewers ﬁxed vertically in the
platform to prevent the sideward movement of the trumpet, as seen in the diagram on
page 123. No doubt the force which tilts a table so much more easily than it raises it found
it easy to push the trumpet. Only on two occasions did I obtain photographs showing that
the trumpet had been raised above the encircling, guarding ring (Fig. 383, page 246).
The automatic ﬂashing apparatus was on a wine case. In both photographs this is
shown perfectly sharply deﬁned and level and no foot close to it.
There were several good ﬂoating lights seen by myself as well as by the others. The
trumpet hit several of the sitters one after the other.
(254) Topsy came through and spoke to me about my mounting, or about to mount
pictures on large pieces of cardboard. [As a matter of fact, I had recently been thinking about
this subject, namely, how best to mount four halﬂplate prints on a piece of white cardboard
for the production of half-tone blocks. It is evident from this and previous sittings that
Topsy (or the medium) can know some things which are in my mind.]
Page 246 Fig. 383 Pars. (255), (256) AUTOMATIC FLASHER
(255) April 12th,—Topsy warned me to he very careful with my papers as l was
in danger of losing something, which would cause me much trouble. [Shortly after this sitting
my solicitors asked me for some deeds connected with a piece of property which I proposed
selling, and I had to hunt high and low for them and was very much distressed about them.
It turned out afterwards that the solicitors had the deeds.] Brown Wolf came through
.\lrs. Deane and announced his departure from the circle ; he said he had other work to do ;
he would come back to the circle later. Brown Wolf bid us good-bye; we thanked him;
he said he was very gratiﬁed. Topsy complained about my moving about the room after the
circle was formed, and said that should never be done at séances. My experience of
Mrs. Deane's séances is that my moving about does not inhibit phenomena at all. The bell
rang several times, and as Mr. Brightwell was practically under it. no one could have operated
it without his knowledge.
May 3hl,—Tlie illuminated tambourine ﬂoated gently (slowly) three or four feet from the
ﬂoor and suspended itself on the top of the trumpet. The tambourine later left that position
and ﬂoated about quite high and fell with a crash on to Mrs. Brightwell. The tambourine,
shining with luminous paint, ﬂoated for a third time and struck the gong l was playing. The
bell hanging high up just over Mr. Brightwell was rung quite a long time while we were
singing. It must be remembered that during this time I could have ﬂashed at any moment
and the phenomena really tempted me to do so, but I did not.
(256) Topsy came through and complained of my sitting up so late
"
sticking photographs
and ticking off." [Work I had just been engaged upon. Topsy has given me many proofs of
knowing something of my doings at my rooms and elsewhere]
Fig. 3553. Photograph oI Automatic Flasher. Trumpet in the act oI talling.
The small white triangle is the weight ; the string attaching it to the trumpet is caught up by the encircling wire ring.
July 19th—A new phenomenon occurred: thumping on the photographic dark-room
door, as if someone were inside the dark-room. My camera with its long straddled tripod
was against the dark-room door and I was sitting nearest it, so that no one, in the dark,
could have got close to or inside the dark-room without touching me, or knocking my
camera over (see plan of room, page 106).
Termination of this series of Si'unces.
AUTOMATIC FLASl-IER Par. (25 ) Figs. 384,385 Page 247
Figure 384 represents the automatic ﬂasher (for diagram and description of it see page 213)
with the trumpet raised by me to show the string and weight attached to the trumpet.
Only when the weight is raised by the trumpet rising the full length of the string does the
platform rise and thereby close the circuit and ignite the ﬂash powder. The conical weight
is seen attached to the end of the string.
Seances held at the aulhor’s rooms in 1929.
(257) November 28th, 1929.—Figure 385 is a photograph taken at a séance at my rooms.
The trumpet was on the platform and appears to have been raised above the ring fencing it in
(see diagram page 223); it is in the act of falling on to the ﬂoor where I found it lying prone.
1 made an exploration immediately by means of an electric torch. The weight is seen
just within the ring fence, hanging on it. From the attitude of the sitters it would seem
that no one lifted the trumpet. I have made control experiments and ﬁnd I cannot with
draw my hand quickly enough from the trumpet to prevent my action being registered in the
resulting photograph.

The 19.1.9 sittings were not at all successful, very little happened. We, a few relations
of mine and friends, and .\lrs. Deane and her daughter Vi, met weekly and passed the
evenings fairly agreeably with the wireless on and with conversation. The object of the
sittings was to obtain photographs. I had control of the ﬂasher ; there were three or four
cameras loaded with plates and with lenses uncovered, the room was dark ; frequently my
automatic ﬂasher was installed. Disclosure by the cameras of any tomfoolery was a foregone
conclusion ; it only wanted my pressing the electric switch fast enough or a disturbance of
the automatic ﬂasher. The medium had ample experience of what would follow. No
one in a normal state of consciousness would take such a. risk.
As these experiments are obviously of no value as evidence, they are not described.
Moreover, any such conscious action would have been sheer stupidity, as we were not
a circle of impressionable emotional folk but experimenters in search of facts to be proved
by means of photographs ; phenomena. without photographs would be of no use to us, and
photographs of phenomena produced by trickery would be worse than useless, as the trickery
was bound to be disclosed in the photographs, as indeed was the case on more than one
occasion. Dealing with normal persons, trickery would be the word—there is no other which
would ﬁt the case.
If one assumes that the medium was not restrained by her sense of duty from trying
to amuse herself or satisfy us by trickery, one must further postulate that she was stupid
enough to produce photographs of her own acts of deception.
In view of the many unquestionably supernormal results recorded in this volume
produced by this same medium in previous years, I can only conclude that the inﬂuences
of the lengthy dark sittings and expectation put her in states of somnamhulic trance when
her conscious self was not responsible for her actions.
The great medium Eusapia Paladino was not guiltless of trickery. Dr. J. Ochorowicz
points out that "fraud is inseparable from mediums, just as simulation is inseparable
from hypnotism."
Dr. Thomas jay Hudson says in The Law of Psychic Phenomena .0—" In strict justice
to professional mediums it must be said that the detection of a medium in fraudulent
practices does not per se prove that he was consciously guilty ; for it is an undoubted fact
that when a medium is unconscious, and his subjective mind is in control, it often acts
capriciously; and presumably-fraudulent practices might be indulged in without the
objective knowledge or consent of the medium. Therefore until the laws governing the
subject-matter are better understood, we should extend the broadest charity over the
professional medium."
Those who would ﬁnd a few of the results of my many experiments with Mrs. Deane
suspicion-raising must not set them against the very great majority of results obtained
by me with her which no amount of scepticism will explain. Puzzling things occur with the
best proved mediums. We know nothing of the collateral effects of the operating inﬂuence
upon the medium. Once you establish the genuineness of a medium, there may be good
reason to father upon the
“
operator
" and not charge to the medium certain phenomena
which, in the absence of an unknown inﬂuence, would justly be characterised as fraud.
It is probable that psychic phenomena and trickery have a common origin ,: a boy
may speed up a watch and at the same time damage its regulator. That, it seems, may be
the solution of the conﬂicting experiences of the genuine and the apparently fraudulent
with most physical mediums.
Until researchers abandon the idea that a few trick-like actions bar a medium from
further consideration many true psychic facts will be lost. My extended experiments have
proved to me that such a course is fatal. I am only endorsing what: all the best researchers
have emphasised.

Smoked, i.e., Sooled Seance-Table cardboards.
Parliculars of marks which appeared on sooted
cardboard pinned on the under surface of (be
fable at fhe a'eances reporled upon in chaoler VI”.
I arrived nearly always half an hour before the sitting and, either alone or with the
help of Miss Deane, prepared the séance room, pinned a white card on the under surface of
the table, sooted the cardboard (at ﬁrst with a candle, later with a turpentine ﬂame) and set
the camera in position, etc., taking care not to leave the room before the sitting, and keeping
watch. The room is very small. For plan of room see page 106.
At the later sittings my friend Mr. Bird was with me, and was an additional guard;
but not necessary, as the room is so small and the table, after the card was sooted, always
stood right way up with the sooted cardboard facing the ﬂoor, and I never left the room.
No one had an opportunity of surreptitiously marking the sooted cardboard before the light
was turned out, nor after the light was re-lit.
At every sitting for many months I ﬁxed such a piece of cardboard (sooted) under the
table (about ﬁfty in all) ; on nearly every occasion we obtained marks; many of them
very lacking in design. I have reproduced nine which have interesting features.
October 301b, I923.-—Without mentioning my intention to anyone, I brought with me
to the séance a disc of cardboard, about rr-in. in diameter, covered with white paper.
I turned the three-legged table, described on page an, upside down in the presence of the
company and ﬁxed the cardboard by means of drawing pins to the under surface of the table.
By means of a candle I sooted the exposed surface of the cardboard all over. I explained
that possibly, if anything lifted the table by its under surface, we might get marks on the
cardboard. The wire fence was, as always, put round the table. and we sat as usual.
While Mrs. Deane was in trance Hulah came through and said
"
Look under the table
after the sitting."
On turning the table up in the light the sooted cardboard was found to have a drawing
of the ﬁgure
"
6
" and two crossed lines on it (not illustrated).
November 21st, 1923. (Fig. 41 i No. 2). To-day I brought with me a disc of white cardboard
r5-in. in diameter. This is the size I always used in future. I pinned it on the under surface
of the table and sooted it. After the sitting we found on it a circular scrawl, and, some
distance from this, peculiar markings in a straight line which could hardly have been produced
by one of the sitters.
Note in the scrawl on the left hand the two curved somewhat circular lines in the centre.
They are quite similar in shape over some distance (parallel) and obviously suggest the use of
a hairpin.
January 9th, 1924. (Fig. 41 I No. 3). This design I have called the
"
Mandarin." It suggests
vaguely a Mandarin with baggy breeches. To me it seems impossible for the design to
have been put on the table by any one of the sitters during the sitting, and it was certainly
not put there at any other time.
Here we see the parallel lines again. In addition there are quite a number of shorthand
like small scrawls.
February 61h, 1924. (Fig. 4H No. 1.) Again the parallel lines. On the left is a complete
triangle, the corners of which are perfect. It seems hardly possible to draw such a perfect
triangle in the dark, and to put so much scrawling round the triangle without once touching
it. During the sitting I asked Hulah. who came through Mrs. Deane in trance, to write her
name in large letters on the cardboard. Hulah said she must not disturb what had already
been put there.
March 5th, 1924. (Fig. 41r No. 8.) Note the number of small shorthand-like marks.
Page 270
SOOTED CA RDBOARDS Page 271
March 12M, 1924. (Fig. 411 No. 6.) Again the small marks and one small triangle. During
this sitting we had been told by typtology to take our hands off the table. This may have
been to keep the table steady while the marking was being done to the cardboard.
June 23rd, 1924. (Not illustrated.) Evening séance. At the commencement of the sitting
the table spelt out
"
Late," but we were not later than usual. It is a curious thing that
on the sooted cardboard under the table to-day we found at the end of the sitting a word
of four letters beginning with "
L " and ending with "T," "
Lait." This word appeared
again on the sooted cardboard at a subsequent sitting.
July 21st, 1924. (Fig. 41r N0. 4.)
July 28th, 1924. (Fig. 411 No. 7). The sign of the Cross with Circle on the left is curious.
August 5th, 1924, (Fig. 411 No. 9.) To-day the table spelt out by typtology the word
"
Lait." We asked the table to repeat, as we did not think "
Lait
"
could be meant.
"
Lait
"
was again spelt out distinctly.
After the sitting the sooted cardboard was found to have some markings like strange
writing and drawing, and the word
“
LAIT "
in mirror writing. I could ﬁnd no mison d'étre
for the French word
"
Lait."
September 8th, 1924. (Fig. 411 N0. 5.)
November 8th, 1924 (Not illustrated.) During the sitting the table spelt out
"
Page 10
no good." On the sooted cardboard was found written the number
"
10."
February 3rd, 1925. (Not illustrated.) The number 1616 in mirror writing was found
on the cardboard.
March 24th, 1925. (Not illustrated.) Another triangle.
May 4th, 1925. (N0t illustraled.) A third triangle.
A further three-dozen cards had scrawls upon them, and many of them, in addition,
the small shorthand-like marks [I once learnt shorthand].

CHAPTER X
Concerning Mrs. Deane as told me by herself,
including some remarks made by her.
(258) Mrs. Deane is of a Kentish family named Marriott. Her mother died at twenty
eight years of age, having borne nine children, two male and seven female.
Soon after her birth in 1862, she was taken charge of and adopted by her grandmother,
Mrs. Oliver.
One of her sisters, M., was psychic, and went at times into trance, but would not
recognise it as trance. She was of a religious turn of mind and would have nothing to do
with psychic subjects, and thought her trances were merely ﬁts. She was really a materialising
medium, and in her presence hands are stated to have appeared and have been known
to turn out a lamp.
I am told that both Mrs. Deane and her sister have been subject to levitations; that
on one occasion the former had ﬂoated down a staircase, and that she had been seen by
some nuns, when levitated, but that was some years since.
At nine years of age the child started to go out to daily work while living with her
grandmother. At eleven years she went into service. She married and had three children,
two girls and a boy, all alive. When the children were quite young, Mrs. Deane was forced,
through circumstances, to ﬁnd a home for them and herself, and earn her own living. At
ﬁrst she went out as a day-servant, working long hours and earned I/-, later 1/6, a day.
This scanty remuneration she tried to supplement by other, evening, work. Later she
obtained a permanent situation as cleaner of a RC. school, where, in addition to the ﬂoors
and desks to keep clean, she had 497 panes of glass to clean inside and out every month.
This situation she retained for seven years, but lost it when her psychic photographic powers
came to the knowledge of the school managers. This employment enabled Mrs. Deane
to support her children and bring them up successfully.
Mrs. Deane's brother-in-law has a situation as a photographer, and Mrs. Deane states
that he avoids her for fear of being infected by her abnormality. She told me that his wife
(Mrs. Deane's own sister), through religious scruples, considered the psychic photographs
as of evil origin.
From the same source I learned that as a child she had access to an attic where she
used to play with a spirit child. When she slept in a certain bedroom, a spirit boy used
to torment her. Her grandmother put these things down to nightmare.
One of Mrs. Deane's aunts, when out for a walk, saw on the road two men carrying a
cofﬁn, which they rested on a wall. She went and looked at it and, to her consternation,
read her own name upon it, aged thirty.one. She then turned and looked back, but the
men and the cofﬁn had disappeared. She died after an operation, on the very date inscribed
on the cofﬁn. This had been carefully written down by her mother at the time of the
vision. Her mother kept a note of it in her teacaddy.
This same aunt lost her husband while he was a patient in Maidstone Hospital; he
was on the road to recovery and his wife was making preparations for having him home,
when she saw his ghost one night in the passage. She was sleeping in the same bedroom
as her mother, and an unknown cause opened the door of the room three times after it had
been securely shut. He had died that day. The mysterious opening of the door led the
aunt to enter the passage. Mrs. Deane repeated these various details on several occasions
in conversation with me during the years I have known her.
She had not taken photographs as a child, but started when already a mother. She
bought an old camera for ninepence to photograph her children. That was all her experience
in that way before she started psychic photography.
As regards Mrs. Deane's power as a photographic medium, she gave me the following
account of its origin. There was a spiritualistic church in her neighbourhood (Hackney)
which she used to pass. She became curious about it, and made the acquaintance of a lady
who attended the services there. Mrs. Deane accompanied her on one occasion, and was
very much interested and surprised at a message being given her through a clairvoyant
concerning one of the pupils at the church school she looked after, whom she believed to
be still alive, but who had, unknown to her, died a few days previously. This, of course,
greatly increased her interest in the subject.
Pall 273
Page 274 MRS. DEANE
Among Mrs. Deane's acquaintances in Islington was a Mrs. Hogg. This lady had a
weekly spiritualistic meeting in her house which Mr. Streeter, a medium, conducted.
Mrs. Deane attended one- of these circles and was told by Mr. Streeter that she would
develop into a psychic photographer. At that time she knew nothing about psychic
photography, and did not understand what it meant. It was arranged that she should
try, with Mr. Streeter's help, to develop this strange power, and accordingly she sat for
several months. She did not note the period, but says it must have been nearly six months,
before her ﬁrst psychic photograph appeared in July 1920. So long was the period of
incubation that Mrs. Deane was losing heart, and had made up her mind to spend no more
of her small means on photographic plates, and to give up the attempt, when her ﬁrst
result came.
I made a point of interviewing Mr. and Mrs. Streeter, and they conﬁrmed these
particulars given by Mrs. Deane.
I should add that Mrs. Deane has told me, that previous to her attending the Hogg
circle, when photographing a friend, the result was of a freakish character, the head
appearing on the shoulders of the sitter not being the head of the sitter herself. This she
mentioned to a Mr. Boddington, a prominent spiritualist.
It seems to me that, although Mrs. Deane has no recollection of Mr. Boddington
having told Mr. Streeter of Mrs. Deane's curious photograph, there is the likelihood that in
this incident we may see the origin of Mr. Streeter's prediction of Mrs Deane's psychic
photographic powers.
When her gift ﬁrst developed she was in the habit of taking photographs of her
neighbouring friends, who are not affluent, and charging them practically what it cost her,
making no proﬁt. She had no idea of turning this power into a source of income until it
was put into her head by a lady connected with psychic work. who well knew the value of
such a very rare power. Her reputation soon spread among those interested in psychic
phenomena, and she has taken some thousands of photographs since that date. Mrs. Deane
has not very much time to give to her photography, as she has much other occupation;
there are her domestic duties, providing meals for her children, and doing all the housework.
In addition, she is very fond of animals, especially dogs, of which she has a number, and
endeavours to make money by breeding them. At one time, in addition to dogs, she had
parrots, rabbits, ducks and chickens.
The following particulars as given by the medium may he of interest.
On one occasion she went to Woolwich by appointment with the Spiritualistic
Association; and took thirty-nine photographs, and on thirteen of those were Extras. I saw
a letter from the Secretary to her, in which was the remark that several of the Extras were
recognised.
I was shown some prints of a Mr. Young which bore the name Young at the foot in
addition to freak markings. It appears that this gentleman is a photographer, and had
secretly photographed his name upon the plates, which, of course, came out on development
as a proof of non-substitution of plates.
She also gave me a photograph of a Parish Stocks which she had taken when on holiday.
There was a small Extra in the picture which, of course, she did not expect or wish for.
Mrs. Deane remarked that it would appear that the Extras I am getting, i.e.,
" freaks,"
emanate from myself, and not from her.
On a photograph taken of Lady L. at the Stead Bureau, when she was tired after taking
many others, appeared Lady L.’s son and daughter as Extras.
Mrs. Deane told me she recognised an Extra of Major Spencer without being prompted.
One day she informed me that something had seized her in bed the night before by the
shoulders and said
"
Come along." She withdrew from the body which she then saw lying
on her bed and was carried rapidly through the air. She was seized with great fear. She
was informed she could not be taken further on account of her fear, and was rapidly taken
back to her sleeping body.
Mrs. Deane told me she knew nothing of the conditions which brought success, except
to this extent, that she succeeded best with bright-tempered people and that she had
excellent results with the members of the Central Spiritualist Association, as they’were all
so friendly and happy.
Mrs. Deane gave me a few plates which had not been exposed in a camera, but laid on the
table in the dark at various seances. All these had strange markings on them (skotographs).
On one of them was bold writing; two or more others had Arabic numbers.
October 9th, 1923. The medium said she did not expect much just now as the operators
were concentrating power for November nth (Armistice Day).
Mrs. Deane gave me a copy of the ﬁrst psychic photograph taken by her with
Mr. Streeter's circle. She again told me she had taken many photographs with the
Streeters without success, and had only four plates left. She proposed to discontinue on
account of the expense, as her patience was exhausted, and she was about to give up trying
when she got this Extra, which is like a materialisation. She added that at the beginning
she was in the habit of obtaining these large Extras, and she thinks that the institution of
MRS. DEANE Pars. (259) to (2600) Page 275
tests spoiled the effects. Up to that time she had never been suspected in any way, everyone
having conﬁdence in her integrity. She thinks these tests upset and annoyed the
"
guides."
Mrs. Deane showed me some prints of a gentleman with two ladies; which prints
showed rather freakish effects. She said she usually got such freaks with that particular
sitter.
Mrs. Deane said she had been told by her controls (she says answers come inside her
head to questions she puts) that the reason that I did not have her ordinary Extras on my
plates is that the operators want to give me something for myself, or from myself, which
would satisfy me more, but delay is caused by my anxiety acting as a deterrent.
She mentioned a letter Miss Stead had received from a sceptical professional photographer
from Australia (sec Miss Stead's book, Faces of the Living Dead) bearing wonderful testimony
to Mrs. Deane's powers, as proved by the result of a sitting he had with her.
She stated that on one occasion being very anxious to obtain an Extra for a man who
had been rather kind, she had exposed twenty plates upon him and got nothing. It seemed
that her great anxiety to please him had a deterrent effect.
Mrs. Deane remarked as to timing the exposures that the operators regulated that
themselves by inﬂuencing her. She said she often felt sleepy when taking photographs, and,
concerning development of the plates, she said that all was uncertain with her as to whether
they should be left in a long or a short time; sometimes by prolonging development Extras
on the plates diminished or disappeared.
Mrs. Deane said it is often remarked that she looks strange when taking photographs.
Mrs. Deane told me that the cross produced upon a small glass negative she showed
me was obtained at a private dark séance with a camera without exposure.
I asked Mrs. Deane about a photograph of hers (No. 64 /2). On looking at the print she
pointed out a face or two she had not observed before ; she said one of the Extras was the
son of the lady sitter she pointed out to me in the print. That lady's other son was also one
of the sitters and the medium remarked upon the likeness of the two brothers, that is of the
-Extra and the boy-sitter, which is a fact. The sitters were French, and the photograph was
taken at a hotel.
A Parsee gentleman was very satisﬁed with his sittings. He had some four Extras of
the same female face, each one better than the last ; they were recognised by him. He also
had an Extra of his father. He told Mrs. Deane he had had a sitting with
" T.S.," a well
known medium, and a communication came through from his deceased wife; she wrote
her name down and told him she was trying to get her face on the photographs he was having
taken of him by Mrs. Deane, and that he had had success.
While chatting with Mrs. Deane, I took the opportunity of questioning her as to her
views. She said she was convinced, and always had been from childhood, of a future life,
and of the existence of spirits communicating with us. She expressed her high opinion of
the Catholic Religion. As to the Divinity of Christ, she considered that Christ had psychic
powers, but was, nevertheless, as represented in the Gospels.
Mrs. Deane said she understood roll ﬁlms, but not pack ﬁlms; but roll ﬁlms were a
great trouble to. develop, being very springy, coiling round one's ﬁngers and getting easily
scratched and damaged: that is the sole reason she did not use them.
November 24th, 1924. The sensitive would not admit that the Daily Sketch faces of
footballers, etc., were the same as those in her Armistice Day pyschic photograph. As
regards Siki, all negroes were much alike to an outsider. She suggested that newspaper
interviewers seemed to know nothing of the subject they were commissioned to write about.
(259) Mrs. Deane exhibited some clairvoyance to-day. She stated she saw a large square
envelope upon me and, as she mentioned this, the envelope disappeared. She said this
happened twice. Now, it is a. fact that three days since I sent out a large envelope with
important matters therein, and the contents have been very much in my mind.
Mrs. Deane mentioned a successful sitting she had for photographs with a very nice
clergyman, and got his young child as an Extra, exactly like a photograph of him, also a
son aged nineteen as an Extra. At the time she told the clergyman she saw a youth
standing beside him, who made use of the strange expression,
" Dear Old Pal." The clergy
man stated that was how his son was in the habit of addressing him.
Mrs. Deane obtained an Extra of her father. She was most anxious to get one of her
mother, and had photographed a portrait of her mother, so as to induce good conditions, but
without result.
(260) She related that a. lady came ﬁve times as a sitter, but she never appeared on her plates
at all, nor any Extra, nor the background. She said she once photographed a gentleman
and his two sons. The two sons only appeared on the plate. The same non-appearance
gappened
with Major Spencer; he was sometimes transparent, also when photographed
y his son.
(260a) Mrs. Deane told me for the second or third time an incident of a lady sitter having
her face marked, as if smacked. It appears that Mrs. Deane took a violent dislike to the
manner of a lady sitter for a photograph and thought to herself, " I would like to smack your
face." Mrs. Deane thought no more about it then. The lady, while putting on her hat
Page 276 Pars. (261) (262) MRS. DEANE
before the mirror, exclaimed, "
Look at the red marks on my face, as if someone had slapped
it." The sitter herself made use of the expression "slapped my face." Mrs. Deane states
that the lady's face certainly gave one that impression by the red marks across it, like four
ﬁnger marks.
Mrs. Deane gave me a photographic print of nuns she took at the R C. School, on which
plate the head of Pope Pius X. appeared without any "surround." Mrs. Deane told me
she was asked to take the photograph of these nuns for their keeping. They knew nothing
of her psychic powers and, of course, Mrs. Deane could not show them the plate, so had to
take another photograph.
Mrs. Deane said that her daughter Vi was trying to develop her photographic gifts, and
was taking photographs of Mrs. Robson regularly. Vi had already had some good results,
but very rarely, yet was encouraged thereby to continue. She added that Vi told her that
if her gift developed out she would not submit to any tests ; as she was not going to make
herself a pawn in the hands of a lot of unbelievers.
Mrs. Deane stated that a Mrs. X sometimes, when being photographed by her, willed
the face (face unknown to Mrs. X) of a deceased relative of some friend desirous of getting
her relative to appear ; and that the desired face has at times appeared as an Extra.
The sensitive mentioned how frequently she obtained Extras with strangers, and even
with people whose manner annoyed her, whereas she often fails to get them with those whom
she most desires to please ; for instance, Sir A. Conan Doyle and myself. She also remarked
about more coming at the ﬁrst sitting, and the results falling off afterwards with the same
sitter. She said that an Indian gentleman sitting with her at the Stead Bureau had recently
got a strange Indian face as an Extra. He did not recognise it. He came again and got the
same face.
Mrs. Deane told me that she can always sense whether there is power about or not,
and she can put out psychic force or withhold it. When she has a sitter who she feels is also
giving forth power she herself ceases to concentrate.
Mrs. Deane narrated to me she had been motored down from town by a Mrs. W., a
wealthy lady, to her magniﬁcent place near Woking, and taken photographs on her
(Mrs. W.’s) own plates, and developed them at Ball's Pond Road, but got no Extras, much
to Mrs. Deane's chagrin.
I told Mrs. Deane that I thought some of the psychic photographs were produced by
the operators placing a picture cut.ont from newspapers in the centre of a pad of cotton wool
and photographing it. She replied that she did not know what they did. She again told
me she took no interest in such experiments as mine. She considered that men of science
were as big stupids as others, seeing how they regard her phenomena; she should know
more about the matter than they did, yet they think they know so much better.
(261) December 315i, 1925. The medium told me about a photograph she had obtained
at the November meeting at the Albert Hall containing a number of faces, and that she
went shortly afterwards to a Woolwich meeting or service, and obtained a photograph covered
with cloudy matter and faces, an exact copy of that obtained at the Albert Hall, but not
the whole of it. These were published in The Two Worlds, December Ioth, 1926. Mrs. Deane
stated that when she saw the prints she was sorely tempted to break the second plate, but
resolved to face the matter out, for, she said, nothing worse could be said of her than had
already been said.
(262) She has frequently told me, and repeated it to-day, that Mr. P., a clairvoyant, although
in the ﬁeld of view, does not come out on her plates, with one exception, namely, on an
Armistice Day. Of the two plates 1 saw, on which he did not appear, although he was stated
to be in the ﬁeld of view, one of them has a great splash in the place of this gentleman, and
as to the other, he was simply not there. In one of the Extras I saw on a plate to.day, a
man's face appeared as Extra and wore spectacles. Mrs. Deane said she thought that many
Extras were simply pictures conjured up by spirits. Among other things she spoke about,
was the difficulty that even spirits have to get their photographs upon plates. As an instance
she recounted to me how Miss Stead did not obtain her father when instructed by him to
go to C rewe for the purpose. She added that Miss Stead remained a day or two longer at
Crewe and ultimately did obtain the face. Asked later by Miss Stead why his face did not
appear at the ﬁrst sitting, Mr. Stead said he was so excited that he could not manage it.
I asked Mrs. Deane about a photograph taken by her of Mrs. Robson. She said it was
taken without any view to an Extra at all, but as a memento of the family, as one of the boys
was going abroad; nevertheless the blemish of an Extra appeared on the photograph, which
Extra was recognised by Mrs. Robson as her deceased uncle.
December, 1927. The medium told me that when she took the photograph at
the Albert Hall Armistice Service during the two minutes silence, she saw, clairvoyantly, a
number of lights over the heads of the congregation. She said they were far brighter than
the lights in the Hall, and so strong they made her eyes water and tears ran down her
MRS. DEANE Par. (263) Fig. 411A Page 277
cheeks. She stated that a Russian who was present told her he was affected in the same
way by the strong psychic lights. .
I remarked to Mrs. Deane in conversation, that the unseen powers seemed to be not
altogether of a reverent and benevolent character.
" Yes," she said, "
I agree with you,
and they do not seem to mind what harm they do to me ; the other day I got an Extra
upon one of my plates which shows a sheet opened out with photographs pinned on it just
like ordinary photographs."
Mrs. Deane remarked to me that there was very little money in this photographic
business for her. Often she will make fruitless ﬁve-mile journeys to the Bureau at
Westminster. She will at times give second sittings where the results have been nil,
in order to try and satisfy the sitters. She pointed out that there are many holidays when
she earns nothing.
(263) She told me of a photograph she had taken recently at a lecture, Miss Stead being on
the platform. Miss Stead's body did not appear on the plate, whereas the cloak on the back
of the chair, the chair itself and Miss Stead's feet, the other sitters and the platform were
all normally in the photograph.
As regards Mrs. Deane's remarks, while they are in nowise evidential, I have no cause
to think they are not truthful statements, and one or other of them may one day be found
to be corroborated by other experimenters, and so help forward knowledge of the subject.
Illay 14th, 1929. As an example of Mrs. Deane's unreasonableness and utter failure
to appreciate the incredibility of psychic photographs, and her complete lack of under
standing of the requirements of exact science, I would give the remark she made to me to-day.
I said that Miss Stead's present method of having the plates marked, wrapped and sealed
in pairs by an outside ﬁrm of plate-makers was very proper. She considered that it was very
unnecessary after all the excellent results already obtained during so many years ; and this
remark was made to me, who had recently pointed out to her the cut-paper appearance of
many of the Extra faces, the screen marks, etc., etc.; as if it were not necessary to accumulate
proof upon proof to set off against those photographs which have every evidence of pro
duction by normal means, and thereby to show that normal means may have been employed
by some other entity than Mrs. Deane's conscious self.

APPENDIX.
APPENDIX.
In this Appendix I place some articles referring to experiments made and
results obtained by others than myself which, I think, may interest readers
and which it seems well to preserve or render more accessible. Where accounts
have been furnished by others I leave their wording as received by me.
I use the Appendix also to make one or two additions to my own work,
which I had omitted or had not room for in the body of the book, or which were
not ready at the time the body of the book was paged; and for a few other
matters and scraps of notes which appear to be pertinent to the subject dealt with.
The time at my disposal has not allowed me to do much of this work in the
thorough way in which it would have pleased me to do it. I cannot too strongly
recommend Mr. Coates’ book as a mine of information on psychic photography;
of another work of his Sir William Crookes, O.M., F.R.S., wrote :—" It is written
in a fair spirit which invites unbiassed criticism." The same can be said of
his book Photographing the Invisible. In it he gives the main facts known of
the subject and points out the various peculiarities of the Extras which lead those
unfamiliar with the matter to dismiss it as fraud, such as cut-outs, double exposure,
etc.; he also discusses in a sober manner the various hypotheses put forward.
Mrs. Madge Donohoe, apparently a skotographic medium, has permitted me to give some
illustrations of her skotographs.
I am indebted to Miss Toulmin, of Shefﬁeld, for illustrations with particulars thereof;
also to Dr. Kallenberg for his contribution.
My thanks are given to Mr. H. R. Muskett, of Norwich, for illustration Fig. 424, and to
the late Dr. Glen Hamilton for permission to use the illustration Fig. 422.
Fig. 438 is from the Boursnell collection of psychic photographs presented by the late
Mr. S. W. Woolley, to the British College of Psychic Science, and is included by kind
permission of the College.
Lacey-Rita skotographs. Mr. H. Blackwell gave me a number of these obtained over
thirty years ago on quarter-plates by Mr. Lacey assisted by Mr. Rita. Many of these
skotographs have a character of their own. I think, therefore, that a few of them should
be included in this Appendix with all the particulars concerning them I have been able to ﬁnd.
Among those of high standing and ability who have carried out systematic experiments
in psychic phenomena, the names of Dr. Hare, Baron Guldenstubbé, Sir William Crookes
and Prof. Z6llner stand out prominently. The writings of Sir William Crookes (Researches
into Spiritualism by Sir \Villiam Crookes, F.R.S., 3/6, "The Two Worlds," Manchester)
and Prof. Z6llner (Transcendental Physics by Johann Carl Friedrich 76llner, translated
by Charles Carleton Massey, London, 1882) are well known and accessible. Not so well
known are the works of Dr. Hare and Baron Guldenstubbé. The ﬁrst published in 1855
a book entitled Expnimmtal Investigation of Spirit Illanifeslations; the second, in 1857,
Pneumatologie or The Reality of Spirits.
As the books containing the systematic experiments of the two latter are not easily
obtainable, it occurred to me that a good purpose would be served by giving some extracts
from the works of these two serious experimentalists.
Baron Guldenstubbé's social position was such that one may conclude he would not put
his own name and the names of his friends to any report for the validity of which he could
not vouch. The results he gives lend support to mine reported in chapter VII.
Robert Hare, M.D., was Professor of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania,
and author of many chemical and physical treatises, inventor of the scientiﬁc instrument
described in text-books of physics as
“
Hare's Spiral", the Oxy-hydrogen Blowpipe, etc.
Dr. Hare approached the subject of so-called spirit manifestations as a sceptic. Later,
to prove for himself whether the phenomena he witnessed were really such as could not, under
the conditions he imposed, be produced by trickery (conscious or unconscious) or be facilitated
by clairvoyant power on the part of the medium, Dr. Hare invented some simple pieces of
apparatus which he described and illustrated in his work. As he invented and used apparatus
which appear to be fraudproof and from which he obtained most conclusive results, I con
ceive it worth while to reproduce here illustrations of these apparatus and short descriptions
of his methods, in the hope that others will repeat his experiments. In these days of
inexpensive electrical devices such as the electric printing or tape machine, the results
could easily be made self-recording. .

(264) An H 6‘ F experimenl omitted from Chapler V”.
November 24th, 1924.—The following experiment was omitted from this day's account
on page 130 by inadvertence. As it is rather interesting and evidential I am inserting
it here.
First expcrimmL—J took a saucer with some oil colours, quite caked and hard, and
placed a piece of white cardboard I2-in. x 12-in. over it. Mrs. Deane's right hand was
put on top of the card and her left hand under the saucer; I placed my right hand over
her right hand and my left hand over her left hand. We sat for half an hour. I did not
let go her hands for a moment. She said she could not concentrate; all the time she was
thinking of the Daily Skelch's alleged exposure". She could not sleep. I got her to sing a
hymn as a distraction. On removing the cardboard there was on the lower side of the
cardboard, that is to say, the portion covered by the saucer, a small broad
“
S
"
about :iii-in.
high, not made by the oil colour but by some foreign material. I found in the saucer a chip
of about '/0“; in. square of wood of a soft ﬁbrous nature, black in colour. I rubbed it on my
hands and it made a blackish mark.
(265) Comment.—As my hands were on Mrs. Deane's during the whole of this experiment
and the saucer was pressed against the cardboard the whole time there is no possibility of
this mark being put on without my knowledge in the position in which I found it ; the piece
of ﬁbrous woody material was not in the saucer at the commencement of the experiment.
Unfortunately I lost this apport (?).
' See .\liss Stead’s Faces ofthe Licing Dead, Chapter 8.
(266) A furlher H 6 F experimenl.
january 9th, i933.—l called at Mrs. Deane's this evening without any warning that
I might make an experiment. It is my habit to call upon her now and again to hear
about the Extras she is getting; I had not made any experiment with her for many
months.
As a surprise I gave Mrs. Deane sixteen sheets of 8-in. x 5-in. cartridge paper to hold
between her hands. I had broughta red-light electric torch with me. Between the sheets
numbers 5 and 6 I placed a sensitized quarter-plate, and in the red light Mrs. Deane held
the packet quite ﬂat between her hands for twenty minutes.
The sixteen sheets were fastened together in the left-hand
top corner. I sat quite close to her. Then I removed the
uarter-plate to develop it; in one comer of it was a \
eﬁnite oval, reminding one of a. face; it looked like " 0
varnish and was quite strong; about ll-in. x I-in. It
was impossible for Mrs, Deane to have got at this plate
as it was pressed between the paper, and the red light was
sufﬁciently strong for me to have seen her playing any
tricks. This was a surface mark on the plate.
I tried the same experiment with another plate
(nothing appeared).
On developing the two plates the mark on plate
No. I gradually disappeared in the Rodinal solution ; the
hypo removed it completely.
There are some light stains on the face of sheet No.
5 which was against the sensitized gelatine of the plate, Qo
but not where it would touch the plate. There are no
similar marks on any of the other sheets. ln afew days
the mark went darker as such
"
Deane
" marks have \
mostly done. (Fig. 412)
Mrs. Deane was very tired (having been up all night
with one of her dogs) and fell into a trance. First of all
a male voice came through ; the voice said it was W. T.
Stead speaking and sent a message to Miss E. Stead.
(2660) Connnent—For many marks appearing on Fig. 412_
inside pages of packets of paper see Synopsis
" U," also
Encyclo. of Psychic Science "Direct Writing" and in
Index to Holms’ book the same. Further good evidence is given in Mr. Hamlin
Garland's work Forty Years 0/ Psychic Resean0h. He says that under perfect test
conditions he obtained writing on an inside page of a pad of blank paper; also that a
pencil was placed at random in a book, and a sentence from the right hand page, where
it lay, was written on the margin of the left hand page, while the book was closed. See
also p. 8 herein.
APPENDIX. Pars (267) to (269) Fig. 413 Page 281
(267) Mrs. Deane's S's appear again in I932.
In December, 193i, Mrs. Deane called at my ofﬁce. 1 gave my clerk Miss Tight, three
single metal slides or holders and three fresh quarter-plates with instructions to proceed with
Mrs. Deane to my dark-room (lit with a red lamp) and hand the slides and plates to Mrs.
Deane who was to insert one plate into each slide, and watch her very closely. Miss Tight
reported to me 1
" When Mrs, Deane put the plates into the slides I watched very closely as
I was instructed to do by you. She had no opportunity of
doing anything to the plates. ln addition when she inserted
each shutter into the slide she held each slide close up to the
lamp to ﬁnd the entrance for the shutter and I can testify
that there was nothing on any one of the plates immediately
before the shutters were pressed home."
These plates were destined for experiments with Mrs.
Donohoe, a private medium for skotographs. l forwarded
the three loaded slides to Mrs. Donohoe who held them in her
usual manner and then posted me the slides, for development
of the plates, without having opened them.
On proceeding to develop the plates 1 found on the
surface of one of them a pair of brown S's about I-in. high
(Fig. 413) reminiscent of the many S's which appeared during
my H and F experiments with Mrs. Deane eight years or so
previously. The developer did not affect these 5's and
nothing in the way of a skotograph or Extra appeared, Fig. 413.
(268) Madame Noels' experiments.
I have recently (1934) learnt that experiments somewhat similar to those of my
H and F experiments were reported in the Paris Psychic Illaga2ine of March and April,
1922, in connection with two sittings of the Transcendental Photography Section of the
Metapsychical Society of Brussels, of which Section Monsieur J. Dardenne was Director.
It was stated that a Madame Noels, a member of the Photographic Section, obtained
in the course of three months about forty prints showing distinct images. Since that
period Madame Noels’ faculty gradually disappeared.
This lady was stated to be an excellent medium, but the kind of mediumship was not
speciﬁed. She usually announced, before the experiment, what image would be obtained.
She gave this information while in a state of trance, whereas the experiment took place
while she was in a waking state. [As with Mrs. Deane]
The impressions were obtained directly on photographic citrate paper, without any
manipulation or bath, by the simple imposition of three ﬁngers during about three minutes.
As a rule the initiative as regards the nature of the image to be obtained seems to have
been left to the subconsciousness of Madame Noels; but on one occasion a star with ﬁve
branches or rays was produced on the request of a gentleman present who showed her a badge.
These paper
"
negatives" were not developed, toned or ﬁxed in any way.
A female head is stated to have been obtained in this manner in which the hair was
yellowish and the face pink; see my experiment (43a), page n9.
These citrate papers were exposed, after the experiment, to daylight. They naturally
became dark violet as usual, but the image remained intact, which seems to prove that on
this part of the print the citrate had completely disappeared or had become insensitive to
light. Certain prints were then ﬁxed in hyposulphite of soda; the paper as a whole turned
brown, but the image remained intact. After a year's interval these images showed hardly
any trace of change.
(269) Delails of tbe taking off/1e photograph in November, 1920,
on which appeared a Child's Head; see page /5, fig. 9.
Wrillen ouf the same day.
The plates were Special Rapid Wellington.
The packet was bought by the author. It was tied up with a piece of linen thread, one
half of the length of which was dyed yellow and the other half was dyed red.
This thread was put around the packet twice crosswise and only a single knot was made
and that in the centre of the ﬂat upper surface of the box where the threads crossed.
Over this was placed a. disc of wafer paper very full of air bubbles. The disc was
touched with a gum brush all over one side. It was then dipped in water and became
quite ﬂabby. In that state it was put over the knot and threads. It was pressed down by
the hand and when nearly dry was impressed with a large rubber stamp F. W. Warrick,
the type of which sank into the doughy material.
Page 282 Figs. 414, 415 Pars. (270) (270a) APPENDIX.
The rubber stamp was then pressed on the. four corners of the upper surface of the
box where the covering paper falls over in a mitre.
When the wafer paper was dry the box was turned over and the lower surface was treated
in the same way, that is to say, a wafer paper disc was put over the crossed threads and
the rubber stamp was used as described above.
Mrs. Deane called at three o'clock at the private house of my friend, a medical man.
She brought her own camera in an attaché case and came into the sitting-room with it.
She produced the packet and gave it up to me. I recognised that it was exactly as I gave
it to her. On account of the pasting up of the ends, the packet was quite difﬁcult to open.
I found the original box of plates with the two wafer seals and all the rubber stamping
exactly as given to the medium with the thread of two colours exactly as put on by me.
No one could have opened this parcel without my being aware of it. The wafer paper is
such as is used under macaroons and cannot be steamed without going pappy, or removed
dry without breaking.
I cut the edges of the parcel and it was given into the charge of Mr. H. M. Bird, the
son of the householder. This young man is a very clever and alert hospital student, half way
through his studies for the M.B., London. He is a very capable photographer. He knew the
importance attached to the experiment and was on the qui vive for fraud. He and
Mrs. Deane went into a bathroom used as a darkroom. He took out the plates and marked
each one in a corner with a pin with the Greek letters M.B., his initials. He said it was
quite impossible for Mrs. Deane to substitute one plate for another; he and she were close
together with their hands not many inches apart ; besides, each plate was initialled, as stated.
On this plate appeared the child's face (Fig. 9, page 15) ; and in the corner of it the initials
M.B., as put there by Mr. Bird.
(270 ) Dcane- Warrick Coloured Photograph
(Puget Process), see page 227(220).
Mrs. Deane asked me whether I would like her to try a colour
photograph upon me as the light was so good; she- added, "Just as
you like, Mr. Warrick." On my answering in the afﬁrmative we
adjourned to the dark room and Mrs Deane loaded the slide in
darkness for the purpose; at least there were sounds which
suggested the loading of a slide.
Myself and an Extra, both in colour, appeared upon the
plate (Fig. 414).
By examination under a low power microscope not the
slightest shake is revealed in the cross lines of the Paget screen
where the Extra joins the picture of the sitter.
(270a) Mr. W. WALKER,
President of the Buxton Pho
tographic Society, obtained
per Hope, at Crewe, under
unimpeachable test conditions
(his own camera used, his own
plates loaded in his own dark
room at his own home), the
ﬁrst coloured Paget Process
psychic photograph, in May,
1914.
To produce the requisite
chromatic effect upon the de
veloped negative to give trans
parencies capable of showing
natural colours when seen
through the viewing screen the
light had to pass through
(a) the yellow glass screen,
(b) the lens, and (c) the tak
ing screen, to reach and affect
the sensitive plate. (Light,
30th January, 1915.)

“Vith reference to the above, Miss Stead wrote me that she saw Mrs. Deane load the
slides with plates which Mrs. Deane took from a new packet given to her by Miss Stead
and that she (Miss Stead) retained possession of the slides from the time that they were
loaded until they were developed. Miss Stead was present when the photographs were taken
and when the plates were developed.
Page 284 Pars. (271) to (273) APPENDIX.
(27/) Some observations on the Photographic results obtained by the
Author with Mrs. Deane.
The fact mentioned on page 30 that Mrs. Deane exposed on myself 300 plates which
I had left with her for some days for
"
magnetisation
"
in packets so sealed with
wafer paper that any attempt at opening the packet would have entailed discovery, and
that none of these plates produced the ordinary Extras but only freakish marks might shake
one's belief in the genuineness of her Extras obtained when the sealing was not so secure.
However, as we do not know the conditions which allow of the production of Extras
all this negative evidence cannot rule out those results which have been obtained under
other conditions when such other conditions excluded all possibility of fraud. If one seeks
some other explanation than that this method of sealing defeated the possibility of trickery
one might argue that the medium's inexperience of wafer-paper scaling raised doubts in
her mind as to the possibility of success with such packets, which doubts infected the
operator (her subconsciousness or other). See p. 357 (372).
" On several occasions, members of the S.S.S.P. have, without Mrs. Deane's knowledge,
substituted a fresh unopened packet of plates for the unopened packet she had with her,
without interfering with the success of the experiment." (The Case for Spirit Photography,
p. 81.)
Mrs. Deane told me that at a dinner of members of the 55.5.1’. at which she was present
Major R. E. Spencer narrated how he had effected such a substitution with an Extra
resulting, notwithstanding.
(272 ) Sir William Crookes at Crcwe.
In The Life of Sir William Crookes, E. E. Fournier d'Albe wrote :—" Sir William also
visited the Hope Circle at Crewe, taking his own plates, ﬁtting them into slides in the dark
room in Mr. Hope's presence, and signing his name on the plates. He thus obtained an
unmistakable likeness of Lady Crookes. The negatives, according to Mr. Gardner (his
secretary), showed clear signs of double exposure, but Crookes clung to the conviction that
this was a real
'
spirit' photograph of his dead wife, and treasured it accordingly. Sir
William wrote, after the experiment. to his best friend :--' I look upon the picture as a
sacred trust, and do not like it to be shown to anyone as a curiosity.'
"
In a review of the above book in Psychic Science, April, 1924, we read :—" The marks
of double exposure are very well known to all who have investigated this matter under the
most rigid conditions, and remain one of the problems of psychic photography, which is a
physical phenomenon."
Sir \Nilliam Crookes wrote to the editor of the International Psychic Ga2ette, December,
[917, "Well, I'shall show you the picture. Everyone who has seen it who knew my wife—not
simply our relations and family—recognises it as her portrait. It is not like any other
portrait that I have. The expression is similar to that she wore during the weakness of
her last illness."
(273) The Schumann Extra.
In January, 1923, Miss FELICIA SCA0I0CHERD invited two photographic expcrts to
test the Crewe Circle. They brought their own plates. They obtained an Extra which was
recognised as a likeness of a Mr. E. Schumann who passed over the previous August. He was
a friend of one of the sitters. Many of his old (photographic) ﬁrm recognised it as an excellent
likeness.
A print was sent to the son of the deceased who was, like his father, engaged in photo
graphic work. He wrote :—-" It is undoubtedly a photograph of my dear Dad. How his
face came into the picture I don't pretend to know . . . I showed the photograph to everyone
here who knew my Dad and they all agreed it was his picture."
In Psychic Science, alongside the Extra, aportrait of the late Mr. E. Schumann is shown;
the likeness is unmistakable.
It is interesting to note that, according to the account, Mr. Schumann spent his last
evening, before starting on a voyage, with one of the sitters; he said on parting: "Will, I
don't believe in your
'
spirits,' but if anything happens to me, I will do my best to come
back to you if it is at all possible."—-Psychic Science, April, 1924.
Miss Felicia Scatcherd was a very gifted lady, particularly experienced in psychic
photography. It was Miss Scatcherd who accompanied Dr. Lindsay Johnson to Crewe
when the
"
White Rose
"
Extra was obtained and Sir William Crookes when he obtained
the Extra of Lady Crookes. Miss Scatcherd invented the word
"
skotograph
" and read a
paper on psychic photography at the First International Congress of Psychic Research,
held at Copenhagen in 1921. Her paper is published in the Report of the Proceedings of that
Congress and is well worth perusal.

(274) The Lelly Hyde Extra.
In a work entitled A General Survey of Psychical Phenomnm by Helen C. Lambert,
there is a psychic photograph (Plate 1), recognised as Letty Hyde, the sitters being
Sir W1LL1AM BARRETT, Miss SCATCHERD and Mr. STANLEY DE BRATl0.I, the mediums
Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton. The particulars are :—
"
Plates specially marked and packet taped and double-sealed by Imperial Dry Plate (00.
Development by S. De Brath, M.Inst.C.E., who certiﬁes that neither medium touched the
plate at any time.
'
Extra '
recognised by her father, mother, three brothers and a sister
as Letty Hyde, for some years a parlourmaid in the De Brath family who died about three
years before. The portrait was cut out and shown without comment, they not being
spiritualists. It is as she looked in her last illness. This is the photograph certiﬁed as
'
indubitable evidence
'
by Sir \Villiam Barrett."
Mr. STANLEY DE BRATH kindly wrote in reply to my request :—" You can take Mrs.
Lambert's remarks as reproduced by you in your letter as my own. Sir William Barrett
kept Mr, Hope in conversation while I developed the plate alone in the dark-room."
(275) Major Spencer's experiments.
The late Major R. E. E. SPENLER was an ardent experimenter in Psychics, his own
son being the medium. A full account of various very interesting experiments in psychic
photography carried out by him in his own home was printed in Light, October 18th, 1919,
page 122, and in Coates' book Photographing the Invisible (Second Edition) ; also in Psychic
Scienue, April 1922.
One of the principal results he obtained was some writing on two pieces of photo
graphic paper which he held in front of a camera one after the other. The ﬁrst contained
a sentence in mirror writing and the second contained the same sentence in normal writing
and on one of these papers could be seen an extra margin. Major Spencer considered this
extra margin represented the overlapping edge of a transparency which had been used to
produce the writing, and that the transparency had been used twice, once in one way and
secondly reversed. He obtained many such psychographs. (Light, 1023,
f).

Mr. Harry Price's Extra with Mrs. Irving.
In the November number of the American S.P.R., Vol. XIX (1925) there
is
a long
article on Psychic Photography entitled Some Scientific Aids Io Spurious Plu'nomcna
by Mr. HARRY PRICE.
The task of the investigator into the alleged phenomena of abnormal photography
is
difﬁcult.
"
What makes
it
still more difﬁcult," he says,
"
is
the fact that only one photo
graphic medium (Mrs. Irving) will come forward to be scientiﬁcally tested. See, however,
p.
3
(I) and p. 310 (325) reporting Mrs. Deane's willingness to be investigated and p. 308
(320) Hope's same willingness.
There
is
a full account of his experiments with Mrs. Irving in Psychic Scimce,
April, 1924, pp. 45/47, also in Light, May 5th, 1933,
p.
273. Mrs. Irving
is
a non-professional
medium, who had psychic powers in many directions and had obtained photographic Extras
with other sitters. She does not enter the dark-room and her share in the work consists of
standing near the camera and uncappiug the lens.
Mr. Harry Price had control, supplied the camera, plates, developer
and carried out all the processes.
At the ﬁfth sitting (December 13th, 1923) the medium clair
voyantly described a hand. She said she saw the deceased wife of a
sitter trying to raise his hand as
if
she wanted him to write. The
number of this plate was particularly noted. When developed an
"
extra-normal
"
marking in the shape of
a
hand appeared on the
plate (Fig. 420). The shape of the hand
is
quite clear and
it
is
not a stain
or emulsion marking. Reporting to the British College of Psychic
Science Mr. Price said :—"
I
can state that the plates never left my
possession from the time they were purchased till the time they were
developed by me.
I
loaded the dark slides, using my own camera.
Although Miss E.
[a
sitter] was in the dark-room during development
she did not handle the slides or plates. All the plates were over
exposed as usual and nothing 0extra-normal' was discovered on the _
remaining ﬁve negatives." ms- 42°0
In the article in the American S.P.R. journal mentioned. Mr. Price refers to this result
as follows :—"
I,
too, am convinced of the possibility of abnormal markings on sensitised
plates; and with Mrs. Irving, the photographic psychic,
I
have secured two or three
interesting examples of extraneous markings on
a
sensitised emulsion."
On account of the conditions imposed the result well supports the reality of Psychic Extras.
Occasionally with Mrs. Irving the result of development faded away quickly. This
is
known to happen at times in psychic photography.
I
have had experience of that with
Mrs. Deane, as mentioned in various places in the records of my experiments.

(277) Experiments of Dr. Carrington and Mr. F. Bligh Bond.
Dr. HEREWARD CARRlNGTON gives illustrations in the journal of the American S.P.R.,
May, 1925, of 21 out of a number of plates exposed in his presence at eight sittings with the
Crewe Circle and Mrs. Deane, which show extra marks of one sort or another.
Of course, Dr. Carrington saw to it that the conditions were good. Dr. Carrington
mentions that he had ﬁve sittings in 1925 with Mr. Hope and that they exposed about 30
plates and obtained about 11 Extras. The plates should have been exposed ﬁve to ten seconds
according to the intensity of the light, but these were actually exposed 30 to 40 seconds or
longer without showing the slightest trace of over-exposure. (This prolonged exposure of
the plates to light without any ill-effect has been reported on many occasions with other
sitters, especially has this happened with Mrs. Deane on Remembrance Day when her
plates had been exposed in the open during the whole of the two minutes' silence and yet
were not blackened.)
As regards the sittings with Mrs. Deane, Dr. Carrington obtained a shaft 01 white light
from his right shoulder about one inch long and a quarter inch wide, surmounted by a cross
piece reminding one of a cabbage. He states that it was obtained upon his own plate,
placed in the camera and afterwards removed and developed by himself. Mrs. Deane certainly
could not have applied a chemical normally here as Dr. Carrington developed the plate.
It is curious that at that particular sitting he had desired mentally that a shaft of white
light should emerge from his right shoulder and appear upon the plate.
As stated elsewhere my view of such freak marks is that they are produced by means of
a chemical applied (invisibly) and are not due to light, see p. 28 (2c).
(278) Dr. Carrington added :—
" A friend of mine, Miss M., the
following year had a sitting with Mrs.
Deane. She had accompanied a friend
to the College and sat on the opposite
side of the room—quite out of the
range of the camera—while he 0sat'
for his picture. She was looking
intently at her own hand, and thinking
about it during the exposure of the
plate (thinking of her new ring, as a
matter of fact, which had just been
given to her); and when the plate
was developed, a hand appeared over
the sitter's head, surrounded by an
'
ectoplasmic
'
cloud. The resem
blance to her own hand is quite
striking, and it is certainly afeminine
hand. The sitter was hoping that a
face would appear. I understand that
hands have been obtained only very
rarely at the College, in all the
hundreds of sittings held there. It is
rather indicative of 'thought photo
graphy,' it seems to me, and analogous
to my own shaft-of-light photograph,
obtained through the instrumentality Fig. 421_
of the same medium." (Fig. 421.)
(2780) Mr. F. Bligh Bond had an excellent
"
open suggestion
"
result with Mrs. Deane,
obtaining a mark on a photo-plate at a suggested spot (see Psychic Science, Vol. 1, p. 134).
(279) Dr. George Lindsay Iolmson on Psychic Photography.
The Rand Daily Mall of the 25th August, 1931, printed an account of evidence given
by Dr. GEORGE LINDSAY JOHNSON in defence of two persons charged at Johannesburg
in connection with psychic photography.
Asked whether he was a scientist, Dr. Johnson said he would not call himself such,
but he had interested himself in science all his life. Asked whether he held any degrees,
he replied that he was a Bachelor of Arts, a Master of Arts, a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor
of Surgery, and Bachelor of Science. He was a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Scientiﬁc
Research of Berlin and Fellow of the Royal Society of Italy.
He was also an expert in photography, a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society,
Gold Medallist of St. Louis VVorld Exhibition, and Medallist of the Royal Photographic
Society of Great Britain. He had been for ten years examiner to the Spectacle Makers
Company of London, had received the Freedom of the City of London and written a book
on colour photography and one on photographic optics, which had reached its ﬁfth edition.
APPENDIX. Par. (280) Page 287
Dr. Johnson said he had during 15 years gained a great deal of experience of psychic
photography, and was a member of the Society for the Study of Supernormal Pictures.
It was possible, he said, to obtain a psychic photograph without the aid of a camera, lens
or plate. He did not approve of the use of the word
“
spirit" photograph, because it was
not material ; no one had ever seen a spirit.
He called it supernormal photography, produced (not necessarily by means of light)
by unknown intelligences, and nobody knew what those intelligences were.
The only things necessary to produce a supernormal photograph, he said, was a medium ;
that was to say, a human being who possessed some rare gift or power, and the unknown
discarnate intelligences.
With those two essentials, Dr. Johnson said, supernormal photographs could be obtained,
with or without a camera, with sensitised plates or ﬁlms.
Dr. Johnson said he had had personal experience of supernormal photographs with various
mediums. He had very rarely obtained recognisable photographs of friends or relations,
but it was like ﬁshing:
" You never know what you are going to catch." He had, however,
on a few occasions, obtained0unmistakable likenesses of friends, the names of whom he
mentioned.
" These spirits [operators] are very funny fellows," he added.
"
They will take copies
of illustrations from a book and transfer them to plates without the box of plates having
been opened. We do not know how or why they do it, but they do it, and I have
known more than one example of it. There is no end to the tricks they do."
(280) From Mr. Arthur Hunter of Ballycastle.
Report of a sitting .\Ir. Hunter, accompanied by the Goligher Circle, had at Belfast with
Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton on the 18th September, 1022.
Mr. ARTHUR HUNTER is an experienced, careful researcher and it is clear that he took
every precaution to avoid being tricked. He writes :—" Mr. Hope and I went into the
dark-room and I chose the two bottom plates from the packet I was carrying in my pocket
and which I had myself purchased promiscuously in Belfast that morning; I signed them
before and after placing them in the dark slide to prevent any substitution in the
subsequent proceedings without my knowledge. The dark slide containing the signed
plates I carried to the séance room, which was in bright sunlight, and Hope bringing a
piece of newspaper in which to roll it, I handed it to him and watched him parcel it up;
then I took it and having tied it with string placed it in my pocket. From this time until
as stated during the Goligher sitting the parcel never left my possession.
Later in the day I joined Hope at the Goligher house where we held a sitting in a room
lighted by an electric lamp. The sitters were the Goligher family and others, making thirteen
in all. “Ve sat holding each other0s hands and hymns were sung and prayers said. Just
before this took place I considered that there was too much light—electric lamp and large
coal ﬁre burning brightly, street lamp outside. In opposition to the wishes of Morrison,
Hope and others, I had the electric lamp turned off. It was then found that the ﬁrelight
lit up the room so that we could see each other quite easily. Mrs. Buxton, Mrs. Morrison
and myself were sitting next the ﬁre about four feet away. During the religious part Hope
was
'
controlled
'
; his guide giving instructions as to the course to follow for best results.
These were principally given to me as the party holding, rather carrying the plates, namelyI
to place the parcel in Mrs. Morrison's left hand who was then to place it against Mrs. Buxton's
forehead. Hope having recovered from control I took the plates from my pocket and placed
them in Mrs. B's hands—one hand on top and the other under the parcel. Now, I placed the
parcel as stated but I also brought it a little to one side so that I could always see the end of
it. The others placed their hands similarly over Mrs. B's and each other's. After a few
seconds I took the parcel, placed it in Mrs. Morrison's left hand who placed it against Mrs. B's
forehead who placed her hands over Mrs. M's and in about ﬁve seconds' time Mrs. Bv received
something like an electric shock, after which I took the parcel. The electric light was now
turned on and I examined the parcel and found it as originally tied up, checked the outer
covering which was correct, examined the camera and loaded it with the slide. Mrs. Buxton
lit a piece of magnesium ribbon and the exposures were made. Then I took the slide out of
the camera, went to the dark-room and developed the plates in the presence of Messrs. Hope
and Morrison. On No. 6 plate appeared a message in Dr. Crawford's handwriting; on
No. 7 a portrait of the late Mrs. Goligher. I enclose copy of Dr. Crawford's psychograph.
Behind the psychograph eleven persons are grouped. Mrs. Buxton and Mr. Hope gave every
facility to carry out the tests."
Continuation from page 285 0f (276).
Mr. Harry Price wrote me concerning the
'
Supernormal
'
hand :
"
I was very much
impressed at the time. I cannot account for the marking by normal means, unless the
hand was put on during the manufacture of the plate or between the time of manufacture
and my purchasing the packet. I am quite convinced that it was a sheer impossibility to
have added the hand during the period of the séance. I do not think it comes within the
DI4
domain of spirit photography, as I see no connection with '
Spirits .
Page 288 Fig. 422 Par. (28]) APPENDIX.
(28!) Dr. T. Glen Hamillon's experiments in Winnipeg, Maniloba,
Canada.
Dr. GLEN HAMILTON carried out a number of experiments with trustworthy mediums
of whom three or more attended the sittings. (See Psychic Science, 1929, October; 1930,
January and July; 1931, January; 1932, January; 1933, January; 1934, January.)
Dr. Hamilton and his friends had not less than six and sometimes as many as twelve
cameras in operation at the same time and they obtained many photographs of ectoplasm.
What interests us most here is that the ectoplasm frequently contained, embedded in it,
portraits of well-known deceased persons such as Conan Doyle and the Rev. C. H. Spurgeon.
There are also curious outlines of faces in the ectoplasm.
Dr. Hamilton says that of 26 faces obtained, 14 have been recognised as those of
departed persons. As to whether these faces are ﬂat pictures or are three-dimensional does
not seem to be quite settled. 1 am printing below two of the doctor's remarks upon this
point :—
“
In the elevation of their tiny features with appropriate shadows and in the incidence
of light to be observed in the eyes as recorded by the various photographs taken from
various angles, one obtains excellent conﬁrmation of their three-dimensional formation.
These teleplasmic miniatures being of supernormal origin (and of this fact I am as certain
as I am of my own existence) we are bound to admit that we are here confronted with a
fact of stupendous importance.
"
The three-dimensional aspect of the two larger faces appears to come very close to
being normal, if, indeed, in the upper face, it is not fully s0. In no other faces photographed
(and I refer now to those obtained by Schrenck-Notzing and Geley) has the three-dimensional
aspect been better manifested."
Dr. Glen Hamilton
has kindly allowed
me to include here

graphs (Fig, 422). For

APPENDIX. Pars. (282) (283) Fig. 423 Page 28
(282) Dr. K. O. Kallenberg of Stockholm and {he Crewe Circle.
There is so much excellent evidence for the genuineness of the supemormal productions
by Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton that perhaps it is going to excess to add another; but the
evidence of a man in the position of Dr. Karl O. Kallenberg is exceptional. Firstly, on
account of his qualiﬁcations, proving him to be a man of more than ordinary ability, having
qualiﬁed for MD. and worked under Prof. Charcot in Paris and Prof. Bernheim in Nancy,
and for thirty years as a nerve specialist; and secondly, on account of his thirty years
(at that time) experience in psychic research.
In the January, 1923 issue of the Quarterly Transactions ofthe British College of Psychic
Science he says that during the winter of 1919 and 1920 when in England he visited Sir
William Barrett, and on his recommendation called upon Dr. Crawford at Belfast and was
able to conﬁrm the genuineness of the phenomena witnessed in the Goligher Circle.
Dr. Kallenberg goes on to write :—
" Dr. Crawford spoke to me about psychic photographs. I could not realise that
such things were possible. I went to Crewe to ﬁnd out. I felt sure the whole thing
was trickery and expected to ﬁnd it so. I remained there a week, and during the whole
of that time I found no sign of fraud or trickery by Mr. Hope or Mrs. Buxton, and
under the conditions I imposed at Crewe there was no possibility of fraud. I am there
fore convinced that these photographic phenomena are genuine."
On my enquiry Dr. Kallenberg wrote
me as follows :—
"One day I saw on Mrs. Buxton's
table a portrait of a lady covered
with representations of ﬂowers
which were declared to be
0
Extras.'
I said
0
Mrs. Buxton, please, try to
give me to-morrow upon a photo
graphic plate I will bring with me,
such a wonderful '
Extra '
as a
picture of ﬂowers.' Mrs. Buxton
promised to try, but said she had
no control over results.
“I now give you particulars
of exactly what happened. I
brought my own plates ; they were
well wrapped up together in the
original unopened box as it came
from the factory, with a wrapper
untouched. I did not lose sight of
the box for a single moment after
depositing it on the table at 2 pm. in
full daylight. After Mrs. Buxton and
Mr. Hope had offered a brief prayer,
the box was taken up and held
between both hands of Mrs. Buxton,
Mr. Hope and myself with our hands
on each other's for about a minute.
After that I took direct possession
of the still wrapped-up box and went
alone with it into the dark.room
and there developed the plates. In
the very poorly equipped dark-room _,
there did not, of course, exist any I0lg- 423
kind of technical projection from radio-active or ultra-violet rays, which perhaps some
may want to advance, if there had indeed been any chance of using such.
"ldeveloped from the plates the topmost packet of four plates and there
appeared sharply delineated upon one of these plates the ﬂowery design shown in
Fig. 423. The remaining three plates did not show any sign of having been affected.
"As I am an experienced amateur photographer, and had had two previous
experiments with Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton when 0
thoughtgraphs ', had been produced,
I am able to declare upon my oath that the possibility of fraud or trickery is quite
out of the question."
(283) At another sitting which Dr. Kallenberg had with the Crewe Circle (Mr. Hope
and Mrs. Buxton) there were present a young man, Mr. Hole and his companion, a blind boy.
Dr. Kallenberg conducted the sitting in his own manner, which differed from the
proceedings usually adopted by Mr. Hope.
Page 290 Pars. (284) to (286a) APPENDIX.
Each sitter held between his or her hands a photographic plate, wrapped in black
paper, ﬁve in all which Dr. Ix0allenberg had brought with him ready wrapped. Seated in
the usual room in broad daylight they continued holding their plates for 35 minutes.
Dr. Kallenberg writes :—
" At the end of that time I collected the plates myself from each sitter, marking
the holder's name on each wrapper when so doing. I took them to the developing room,
where I wrote the name directly on each glass plate before developing it, without the
medium, Mr. Hope, having had any contact with any but his own paper-wrapped
plate. Neither Mr. Hope nor anybody besides myself had anything to do with the
developing process. Nothing showed on any of the ﬁve plates except on that marked
with Mr. Hole's name, on which appeared broad bands, forming a couple of loops
about 2Q ins. x 1; ins."
In the print taken off the plate a face is distinctly seen in one place and two copies
of it elsewhere, in the bands, somewhat similar to the many results illustrated in chapter V.
There seems to be no opening at all for fraud in the above experiment.
(284) Professor james Hyslop.
Prof. JAMES H. HYSLOP wrote (journal of the American S.P.R., V01. IX, 1915)
concerning psychic photography :—"I think we shall often ﬁnd both friends and antagonists
of spirit photography very often right, and this without admitting the genuineness of the
photographs. This means that, until we secure a mass of evidence from authoritative
scientists, the world which has been accustomed to relying on them and has no opportunities
for safe experiment of its own will follow the verdict of the sceptic. The fact is that this
whole subject should receive a most searching historical examination without regard to
either the truth or error of spirit photography. There has hitherto been as much prejudice
on the part of opponents as on the part of believers."
Speaking of the Flora Loudon Extra obtained by the Rev. Charles Hall Cook(see Coates'
book, p. 124 et seq, illustrated) he said :—" In the absence of further knowledge we can only
offer a non possumus to any explanation and be content with a suspense of judgment."
(285) The H. D. Miller Extra of his son.
In a book entitled From the Other Side, ]. H. D. MILLER, the author, gives an account of
a sitting with the Crewe Circle in which he obtained an Extra of his deceased son. That
Extra, together with a. portrait of his son taken in life, are reproduced in the book. There
is no doubt about the likeness. Mr. Miller brought his own plates from Belfast. His visit
was a surprise one : during the proceedings Mr. Hope never handled the plates ; they were
never out of Mr. M.’s sight except when they were in the camera. In view of the conditions
and the likeness of the Extra to the deceased son, of which anyone can form an opinion by
consulting Mr. Miller's book, this seems to be a particularly strong case.
(286) Exlras with a Stereoscopic Camera.
Mr. J. TRAlLL TAYLOR in his experiments with Duguid used a binocular stereoscopic
camera (The Veil Lifted) pp. 27, 32, 33). He found that whatever was produced on one
half of the stereoscopic plates was produced on the other, alike good or bad in deﬁnition.
On carefully examining one he found that while the two sitters were stereoscopic per se the
extra was absolutely ﬂat. He also found that the Extra was at least a millimetre higher
up
i111l
one than in the other. He concluded that the Extra had not been formed by the lens
at
a
.
Mr. GLENDINNING wrote
(
The Veil Lifted,
p.
148)
:
"
Ihave eight photographs taken with
stereoscopic cameras all obtained under test conditions, and all having abnormal ﬁgures
which are perfectly stereoscopic per se, as well as in relation to the sitters."

a
psychic
Extra on
a
pair of plates exposed in his stereoscopic camera." Psychic Science, April, 1924.
[illustrated]
Mr. L. states as regards the above
:
"
I
made (as on
a
former occasion) two exposures
in my own stereoscopic camera; that is, on two pairs of plates. On the ﬁrst pair of plates
I
got Extras as shown in prints marked A and B. On the second pair of plates no Extra
whatever. You will notice that though simultaneously exposed, the two Extras of the same
face are in different positions. The plates were put in the dark slides in my dark-room
in my own home by me and brought back (after exposure at the College) and developed by me.
They never left my possession, and Mr. Hope never saw them. All he and Mrs. Buxton did was
to
'
magnetize
'
them in the slides, in his usual way, and make the exposure by lifting my
black cloth." In the volume of Psychic Science mentioned the Extras are illustrated.
The faces are small, similar to those which,
it
is
suggested, are made by means of luminous
paint discs, but Mr. Hope had no opportunity to apply such discs to these two plates.
At the same sitting Mr. Hope exposed two separate plates in his own ordinary camera.
An Extra, showing the identical face, was secured. The face
is
not recognised.
In Psychic Science, April, r923,
is
an account by the same gentleman, Mr. Charles L.,
of experiments he made with the Crewe Circle under the same conditions as above. Of the

two plates exposed simultaneously in his own stereoscopic camera when developed one was
quite normal, the other bore in addition to the sitter two large clouds. Prints from these
plates are illustrated in the article.

The psychic writing
appeared on one of two
plates purchased here when
Mr. Wm. Hope of Crewe
gave sittings at Norwich in
September, 1931.
These plates did not leave
our possession, and just as
an experiment were held,
in the presence of Mr. Hope,

in, by Mrs. Skedge to
Mrs. Muskett's forehead for
about three minutes. The
plates were not put in a

them myself and found that while one was a blank, the other showed psychic writing.

It will be noticed that the word

can be read by looking at the picture in the
ordinary way, whereas the word

(288) The oNo Thief' Extra.
Miss TOULWN of Shefﬁeld, with experience in photography, kindly gave me the
following particulars of a. curious Extra she obtained at her sister's house when Mr. Hope was
on a visit there.
" I send you the only print of this
'
No Thief
'
Extra of which I told you. I do not
possess the plate. I gave it to Mr. Hope. Mr. Hope neither touched the plate nor saw
it until I had developed it. He was taking photographs at my sister's house.
"At about nine o'clock Mr. Hope said to me :
0
Have you any plates left ? Before I go
to bed I will take you and your sister.' I replied :
0
Yes, I think I have three in the box,
but I will not be taken unless you let me take you on one of them.' With much persuasion
he consented. So he took myself and sister twice, and I took him and my sister.
"Just as we were all going into the dark-room, my sister said, suddenly,
'
Oh! I forgot,
I have a plate that needs developing.' (It was an extra small plate which my sister had been
carrying on herself to inﬂuence the result.) So Mr. Hope said :
0
Well, hand it to me.' She
replied in a very obstinate manner :
'
No one will see this parcel or do anything but myself.'
He laughed and said: '
Then go and get on with it.'
Well, as she passed me she whispered:
'
I don't know
what to do, or how to develop it, or anything about
it. Do come with me.'
" When I saw the parcel I remarked (of course,
jokingly) :
'
Do you know what will be on your
plate? It will be
'
thief
“
As a matter of fact I saw it was avery small plate
that had come from my house and that I rarely used.
She had been staying with me. Well, I developed it
for her and no one was more surprised than I at the
result. (See Fig. 425.)
“ As it happens, although I had forgotten it at the
time, I had given my sister this plate.
“ When we developed the other three (Mr. Hope
being present) on the one with him was merely a good
likeness; on the second an Extra; what was on the
third disappeared leaving the plate blank."

possibility of spirit photography ; to do so would be rash, and very unscientiﬁc, but it is a
question of fact, and of the evidence in the case. That evidence—direct and demonstrable
evidence —in my own person I lack. Evidence at second-hand, in the testimony of many
persons of unimpeachable veracity, is abundant. and easily accessible. This I accept as

(29/) The Pudding Bowl and Bottle Extras.
Extract from a letter received from
Mr. Stephenson, Liverpool, dated 22nd November,
1931 :—
"
.\lr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton told me at
Crewe Saturday last that they had a curious
experience at a house where they took a number
of photographs. Whilst tea and cakes were being
handed round one of the guests asked if a certain
lady had made the cake herself; some relation
replied that this lady did not know how to use
a pudding basin or a spoon and could not cook
anything, let alone make a cake. Afterwards
the photograph of this particular lady was taken
and on the print were found a pudding basin and
a spoon above her head.
On another occasion Mrs. Buxton had a bottle
of brandy wine with her, a non-alcoholic British
production; she asked Hope and another sitter
to taste it. They both said it got to their heads
and they started laughing. Hope later took the
photograph of this lady and when the plate was
developed there was a reproduction of the actual
bottle upside down over the head of the sitter."

Fig. 431
(292) The above is a photograph taken by Mr. Hope on the occasion of the wedding of
Mrs. Buxton's daughter. The object of the taking of the photograph was to provide a
souvenir oi the wedding. That a psychic Extra should come upon the plate was far from
their minds. The Extra between Mr. and Mrs. Buxton represents the brother (deceased)
of the bride.
(293) Mrs. Buxton, who formed with Mr. Hope the Crewe Circle, obtained as an Extra
an excellent likeness of her own father shortly after his death. The supernormal photograph
is not a copy of any normal photograph but there is no doubt about the likeness.
Page 2.94 Pars. (294) to (300) APPENDIX.
(294) Some further Hope Results.
Details of a very careful experiment with the Crewe Circle are disclosed by Mrs. MOORE
BROWNE in Psychic Science july, 1926, as follows:—
"
Possessing some considerable knowledge of photography, having made it, and
especially its more intricate reﬁnements (including several forms of faking) a hobby for
many years ; and having lived a great deal in an atmosphere of scientiﬁc method, I was
prepared to watch the processes and gauge the results with a critical eye. I knew many
speciﬁc suggestions as to possible methods of fraud had been made, and I wished to bear
these in my mind, for although from my reading on the subject it appeared that these had been
sufﬁciently refuted, to obtain personal proof at ﬁrst hand is the legitimate desire of anyone
of a scientiﬁc turn of mind."
The result was on the No. 2 plate an Extra appeared with what is called an ectoplasmic
cloud 2§-in. x 1-in., not of a character which would have been made by the luminous paint
gadget. The next day the same sitter obtained an Extra which she recognised as an
excellent likeness of her husband.
(295) There is a long interesting account given in Light, May 26th, 1933, p. 325, of sittings
conducted with Mr. William Hope by the Rev. ARCHIBALD JACKSON, B.A., concerning
an Extra which he mentally desired to be connected with a third party. His wish was
granted under very good test conditions. The Rev. Jackson ends up by saying :-—" Unless
the most extravagant hypothesis of telepathy from the living be invoked, as well as coincidence
of the most far-fetched kind, the presumption is strong that my experiment had the
intelligent co-operation of some supemormal agency, and that the medium's part in it was
that of a. passive instrument. My own conviction is strong that William Hope was a genuine
and highly gifted sensitive."
(296) The Extra obtained represents the living person wished for as she was twenty years
previously, and as the reverend sitter had never known her.
(297) Further Testimony for Psychic Pholography.
Dr. JULIEN OCHOROWICZ, Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Lemberg,
a distinguished psychic researcher, achieved conspicuous success in psychic photography,
having photographed an etheric hand on a ﬁlm rolled together and enclosed in a bottle.
For this in 191r the Cornité d'Etude de Photographic Transcendentale awarded him a
prize of a thousand francs; a similar prize was awarded to him by the Académie des Sciences
de Paris (Encyclopadia of Psychic Science). For details see H. A. Dallas in Light 1912.
(298) Copy of a letter written by Dr. ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE to Emmanuel Vauchez,
April, 1908, taken from La Photographic Transcendenlalc, p. 9 :—" I have myself a very
interesting collection of similar photographs (psychic) and I have afﬁrmed during the last
thirty years that the evidence which they carry is at once scientiﬁc and conclusive."
(299) Sir WM. BARRETT wrote in Reminisccnces of Fifty Years :-—“ With regard to the
so-called
'
spirit photographs
'
I have been extremely sceptical of their genuineness until quite
lately. Recently, however, experiments conducted by my friend Mr. De Brath, in one of
which he kindly allowed me to take part, appear to afford indubitable evidence oi supemormal
photography. This conclusion conﬁrms the opinion held by some expert and critical expel-i0
menters who have discussed their results with me."
(300) Extras without a Professional Medium.
That private individuals at times ﬁnd Extras upon photographs they take is, of course,
well known to students of the subject ; several such are mentioned in Coates’ book. David
Gow writes in Light, March 24th, 1933 :—" I know that several amateur photographers in
their own homes and with their own friends have secured results which shewed there was a
power at work unknown to scientists."
On p. n (la) is a full account of just such an occurrence.
A curious case of this kind, namely, a photograph of a living deerhound and its late
companion, a Cairn puppy, is mentioned in the following extract from the Evening News
of Feb. 4th, 1932, under the heading
"
Readers’ most curious experiences
"
:-—
" My sister-in-law had a little Aberdeen terrier which was a great pal of a large deer
hound belonging to Lady X. The Aberdeen died, and the big dog was inconsolable.
"About a fortnight after the terrier's death Lady X photographed all her dogs separately.
The deerhound sat for his picture in an attitude of deep dejection, head drooping and tail
hanging limply to the ground. When the ﬁlm was developed and a print taken his little
Aberdeen terrier friend was seen on the deerhound's haunches, looking bright and perky.
There was no question of it being a superimposed photograph."—Colonel C. H. Rowcroft.
D.S.O., Camberley, Surrey.
A full account of this, with illustrations. is contained in Psychic Science, April. 1927.
Mr. Ernest Oaten, Editor of The Two Worlds, one of the most experienced students of
psychic phenomena, referring in a lecture, in 1935, to the value of psychic photography from
the scientiﬁc point of view, mentioned that, of the photographs he then exhibited, a number
were the results of experiments with amateurs.

(30/) The A. C. Hales Exira will: no Professional Medium.
In an account in Light, Sept. 1916, Mr. A. G. Hales, the well-known novelist and war
correspondent tells the story of how he obtained a psychic extra of his wife who died ﬁve
years before in Buenos Aires.
" Last year, about December," he said, "my daughter was strongly impressed to ask me
for a camera, without any clear idea what it was for. I obtained a camera from a fellow
journalist engaged in photography, and with it he sent me plates, and these with the camera,
I handed to my daughter who, with Miss Reid, (a friend of the family) tried to get a 0spirit
photograph' without result. But one day my daughter suspended a cord across the room,
close to the wall, and hung over it a couple of sheets for a background and placed the camera
in front of it. Shortly afterwards while in the kitchen, she heard a voice say 0G0 and take
the photograph now'. She supposed that it was Miss Reid speaking from another room,
and went to her. But Miss Reid knew nothing of it, and, judging that it was a 0message' they
went into the room where the camera was. My daughter put the slide in with a couple of
plates, and looked at the sheets, but even to the eye of clairvoyance nothing was visible.
However, being hopeful of some result, my daughter took oh the cap, exposed the plates,
spoiled one by accident, and sent the other to a photographer to develop with the result
you see. The portrait is clearly recognisable as that of my wife, wearing, however, a
much brighter expression than she habitually wore before passing away. There is no similar
portrait of her in existence. It is a splendid likeness of my wife as she was two years
prior to her death."
(302) Same Exlras with Diﬂ’erenl Sillers.
Mr. JAMES ROBERTSON, of Glasgow, -
the well-known author of the book
Spiritualism, was told in Scotland by Miss
MacCreadie, a medium, that she saw a spirit
of a young woman holding a garland of
ﬂowers over him and that if he had his
photograph taken by a psychic photo
grapher the spirit with the garland would
be shown as an Extra. Mr. Robertson sat
for his photograph with Mr. Boursnell in
London and the Extra shown in the illus
tration was obtained. (Spiriiualism p. 359.)
It is very interesting to note that
exactly the same picture of a female ﬁgure
holding a garland is to be seen in an
illustration on page 310 of Borderland,
Vol. II, the sitter on this occasion being
Mr. W. T. Stead.
(303) Mr. W. T. SIl‘JAD summed it up .
thus: "The same psychic form has F'g0 43’
appeared on plates with other sitters, but that, of course, is as usual. :\ psychic mould or
block having been obtained, it is used again and again, just as we use an electro block or a
negative, to produce any number of copies that may be desired."—Bordcrland, Vol. III, p.43.
If Mr. Boursnell had been a cheat is it likely that he would have put a picture of so
striking and so easily recognisable a nature on the plates of two men so prominent in the
spiritualistic. world ?
Students of psychic photography know of a number of identical Extras with various
sitters. It is thought by some that the
"
operator
"
having made the transparency or what
ever he required to produce an Extra makes use of it on a second or third occasion to save
labour.
Among Mrs. Deane's Extras there are also some exactly alike, which have appeared on
photographs taken by her of different sitters; see page 22, Figs. 46, 47 and .18, and page
23, Figs. 5r and 52.
(304) Concerning David Duguid.
Mr. JAMES ROBERTSON in his work Spiritualism, gives interesting accounts of his
experiences in psychic photography with the mediums Duguid and Boursnell.
“
Duguid," he says,
"
was a working man, a joiner by trade, without scholarship, had
never travelled and could not be called a reader of books . . . For thirty years I have been
in almost daily contact with the man himself." ‘
A great deal about David Duguid is to be found in Mr. E. T. Bennett's book The Dinet
Phenomena of Spiritualism. David Duguid was the medium with whom Mr. Traill Taylor
made his celebrated experiments, see p. 300 (310); he was a medium for Direct drawings
and writings and for psychic photographs. See also Coates op cit p. 282.

(305) Extras through Frau Demmler.
No. 27 (1000) are accounts of psychic photographs
obtained by a Dr. Hotz, head of a book-printing
establishment, with Frau Demmler as medium.
Dr. Hotz was perfectly satisﬁed that he was not
tricked in any way. The Society for Psychical
Research in Breslau investigated these photo
graphs and reported on internal evidence that the
photographs were obtained by normal means.
Dr. Schurtz criticised the report and called
attention to Mrs. Demmler as a well-known
strong medium for many phenomena.
Many efficient, capable and honest investi
gators have proved to their own satisfaction, as
shown in various abstracts contained in this
Appendix, that one cannot decide from internal
evidence whether a psychic photograph is obtained
by fraud or not. No one who was not present can
dispute Traill Taylor0s evidence, the Alfred
Russel Wallace Extra of his mother nor those
obtained at Crewe with my own camera and plates
as described in this work, and yet the internal
evidence in these cases suggests the use of normal
means in the production of the results.
(3050) Fig. 437 at left is an enlargement of the
neck of the Extra in Fig. 435. Note the pin.
(306) Concerning Edward Wyllie.
Excellent evidence for the genuineness of the Extras produced by Edward Wyllie, the
Californian psychic photographer, is given by exceedingly reliable witnesses.
We have Mr. jAMES A. COATES. In his Photographing the Invisible many pages are
devoted to most evidential results obtained with Wyllie at his (Coates’) home at Rothesay
and elsewhere. Mr. Coates' book is easily accessible and the interested reader can obtain it
from any psychic library or bookshop.
\\'e have the Rev. CHAS. HALL COOK, whose experiments were published in the
Ioumal of the American S.P.R., Vol. X (1016). This report was also published in book form,
but this is now out of print.
Dr. ISAAC K. FUNK (of Funk & Wagnalls Company) published a most interesting
tome: The Widow's blite and other Psychic Phenomena, to be found in most libraries of
psychic books ; full details of experiments with Wyllie are contained in the chapter devoted
to psychic photography (pp. 45r-484). See also Dr.]. HYSLOP, jl. A.S.P.R., Vol. IX, p. 171.
Dr. Funk devotes much space to a Dr. WILLIAM J. PIERCE, with whom he was
personally acquainted. He was a manufacturer and inventor owning an important Amer can
business with a. branch in London, a man with an excellent reputation. Dr. Pierce tiook
up the subject of psychics as a truth-seeker and not for emotional reasons. He obtained
exceedingly good results with Wyllie under good test conditions.
Dr. H. A. REID, M.B., devotes his little book, Unseen Faces Photographed, wholly to
Edward Wyllie's mediumship. In Light, ]an. 4th, 1902, he wrote :—“ In your issue of Nov.
9th, I1)o1, you make favourable mention of my recent book—Unseen Faces Photographed.
I followed the investigation diligently for a. year and a half, to satisfy myself and co-workcrs
as to whether the phenomena known as spirit photography did really occur as phenomena,
or were produced by some artful device or secret trick. And as to the work of Edward
Wyllie, the medium photographer, the proofs and testimonies that the phenomena were
genuine and not trickery, were all so open, untrammelled, fair and conclusive that to reject
them is to reject the validity of all human testimony. In fact, anyone rejecting this body
of testimony as insufﬁcient to establish the fact, must by the same logic reject every marvel
related in the Bible, and every decree of any court whereby upon human testimony men
have been convicted of crime."
Dr. Reid then proceeds to give particulars of another very remarkable case which had
not been made public before. It concerns a Mr. John Haizlip. The full report of it is to
be found in the issue of Light mentioned ; details with names and addresses are given.

(307) References to Psychic Pholography in the four volumes
of "Borderland
"
(1894-1897).
From 18944397 .\Ir. W. T. STEAD issued a quarterly known as Borderland. The
following articles deal with psychic photography :—
Vol. I, p. 249, contains a report of a paper by Mr. Glendinning on psychic photography.
On p. 443 there is a long, illustrated account by Mr. W. T. STEAL) of his experiment
with Mr. Duguid. Also a good and interesting review of Twenty Photographs of the Living
Dead by T. Slaney Wilmot, giving details of very curious happenings.
In Vol. II we ﬁnd a paper by Mr. J. TRAILL TAYLOR, the ﬁrst great authority in
Great Britain on psychic photography. He was well known as an expert photographer,
Editor of the British Journal of Photography, and for fourteen years Editor of the British
1!. Photographic A lmanao. He had the courage to admit his conviction of the genuineness of
Extras. He was of the opinion that psychic pictures (Extras) do not come through the lens
of the camera, and stated (p. 241) that Mr. Glendinning veriﬁed this. Mr. Glendinning placed
a plate in a dark slide which, after having been held between the hands of a medium for
a while, was opened in the dark room and on the developer being applied to the plate, a
ﬁgure appeared.
Further on he stated that after much personal experience he felt impelled to forgo
the rash judgment he had given as to fraud in the production of these abnormal ﬁgures
which appeared on the plates.
" Since then, I have been privileged to dictate the conditions
under which a certain series of strictly test séances for psychic photography were some
time since held, and in which there was not left a single loop0hole for fraud to enter, _vet
during which I myself, using my own camera and plates beyond the control of not only the
medium, but of the other spectators, obtained numerous psychic ﬁgures so fraudulent looking
and so shockingly inartistic as to induce the use of unparliamentary language. These
pictures were true and genuine throughout, so far, at any rate, as concerned all those who
were present; my tests were too good to admit of a doubt of this."
Mention is made in this volume of an Extra, called the Cyprian Priestess by the habitués
of Duguid's circle, on whose plates exactly the same ﬁgure had appeared several times.
The head (most inartistically joined to the body) was found to be a copy of a photograph of
a German picture called
" Night," a print of which was discovered in the house of an
Edinburgh lawyer. No other copy could be found, nor was the original traced. Mr. Duguid
neither knew of nor ever had access to the portrait. His honesty in this matter was fully
vindicated. Full particulars are to be found in Coates' work.
Mr. Stead reported (p. 248 of Borderland Vol. II) that
'
Edina '
(Mr. Duncan Antonio),
known to him as a professional man (a lawyer) of good standing in Edinburgh, wrote him :
"
It is a matter of little importance, to me at least, whether the
'
Cyprian Priestess
'
is,
or is not, like the picture entitled
0
Night '
and that, simply because on three occasions the
photograph or likeness of the former has been got under test conditions."
Duguid, when over seventy, was said to have been caught tricking in producing painted
cards. This cannot invalidate the tests made with him for psychic photographs by Traill
Taylor, Glendinning and others, nor cancel the good opinion held of him by his employer
for twenty years, Mr. James Robertson, who wrote of him :
" I knew the man thoroughly,
a more honest, modest person—with ideals of truth and right—I never met."
In the same volume (October, 1895) on pp. 311-324 there is a long article by Mr. W.
T. Stead on the mediumship of Z. [Boursnell]. In it is published the photograph (with Mr.
Stead as sitter) of a psychic ﬁgure holding out a wreath ; exactly the same ﬁgure and wreath
as was obtained with Mr. Robertson of Glasgow as sitter (see page 295, Fig. 432 herein).
In Vol. III (1896) Mr. GLENDINNING gives an account of the experiments he made
with Mr. Duguid for skotographs. He obtained a likeness which he says has now appeared
on seven plates. He says Mr. Traill Taylor obtained on ten plates with several different
sitters abnormal images of one person, always the same head, and bust and dress.
An account of Mr. Lacey's experiments in skotography is to be found on pp. 444 et seq;
see also pp. 347 to 35r of this appendix.
(3070) In Vol. IV a sitter is reported as stating that a spirit form was described in spirit
robes by Mr. Boursnell. The sitter then requested that the form should appear in a dress
which she usually wore, which was done.
(3071)) In the same issue is a report of the experience ofa sitter who went to him (Boursnell)
in 1896, and who had made previous experiments under good conditions :—" A spirit form
was minutely described before the exposure by Boursnell. who stated that ﬂowers were held
up in the hand. I asked my wife, who accompanied me, to hold out her hand, and perhaps
our friend would hold the ﬂowers towards her. Boursnell at once said:
0
Yes, she holds
the ﬂowers down now.' The plate was at the time waiting exposure in the camera. The
photograph was recognised as a relative; the fact of changing the pose on the spur of the
moment after the plates had been0placed in the camera, precludes all possibility of imposture."
Similar happenings occurred on several occasions with this sitter.
APPENDIX. Pars. (308) to (309) Page 299
(308) Experimenls with Linda Gazzera and Mlle. Tomczyk.
Mons. GUILLOUME m2 FONTENAY in a letter (published in Fatogrq/ie di Fantasmi by
Dr. Enrico Imoda) concerning photographs obtained by himself with Dr. Imoda, and also
by himself with Prof. Richet, of materialisations representing faces, the medium being
Linda Gazzera, states that, "considered by themselves in an objective way, they are most
disquieting—faces for example are absolutely ﬂat. One cannot avoid thinking of silhouettes
in cardboard or thick paper, on which the medium may have drawn (as a rule very well and
with extreme precision) the face of a pretty woman, or a young boy; and that is not all.
A number of the photographs are lighted from the wrong side. We will suppose that
the magnesium ﬂashlight throws the shadow of the nose of the medium on to her left cheek ;
jhst behind her, the photograph shows a ﬁne lady, whose nose carries the shadow on to her
right cheek. The immediate conclusion one draws, is that the lady is only a ﬂat drawing,
prepared in advance. [For illustrations see Figs. 447A and 447B, p. 325.]
"Brieﬂy then one would say: 0You believe in fraud ?' No, even it 1 pass for a great
simpleton. The photographs, if one considers them objectively, indicate fraud, but fraud
is contra-indicated in the manner these same photographs are obtained.
" How explain a sketch of a face except by fraud? I do not take it upon myself to
explain it. I bring forward my evidence.
"On the one hand it is perfectly certain that the majority of the ﬁgures which I have
examined are ﬂat silhouettes—on the other hand I consider I have a right to afﬁrm that,
especially at our séances in Paris, the results were impossible without the assistance of some
genuinely supemormal action.
" Assuredly I have not the ambition to make myself understood by sceptics, refractory
to all physical phenomena. Never will they admit that the phenomenon that has the air of
being fraudulent may yet not be so, but I will admit with more difﬁculty still, that the
young girl of whom I held one hand and Dr. Richet the other, and of whom no movement
escaped us, could succeed in withdrawing from her clothes and putting in a good position
the articles which we have photographed."
In the journal of the American S.P.R. (May, 19rr) the editor gives an account of
Dr. OCHOROWICZ' experiments with the medium Mlle. Tomczyk when a psychic photograph
was obtained, and prints M. Fontenay's criticisms of the photograph as reported in the
Ammles Psychiques, August, 1910. M. Fontenay says :—
(308a)
" I think we are before a photograph of a photograph; before the photograph of a
plane object, cut out and placed on the back of the chair, and a towel.
Dr. Ochorowicz recognises that Stasia [the medium's control] has the power to produce
apports. What, then, might have occurred? She might have brought in the cut-out
picture ; she might have brought in some magnesium. It is extraordinary ; it is insane,
if you wish. But this is the least removed from known precedents. [The camera was
standing loaded with plate exposed and lens uncapped in an adjoining empty room; a
ﬂash of light was seen under the door by the medium who was alone in a position to see it.]"
M. Fontenay, says the editor, by an experiment of his own reproduced the type of
picture concerned, and the result is quite an exact reproduction of the effect in the picture.
Dr. Hyslop concludes therefrom that the photograph obtained through the medium must
have been produced in some such manner, that is, with mundane material, whether super
normally or otherwise. According to the very experienced and reliable Dr. Ochorowicz the
conditions of control were very good.
(309) Comte de Bullel's experiments.
A long account of ('omte de Bullet's experiments in psychic photography with Alfred
H. Firman was sent to Borderland (Vol. III, page 183) by Mary J. Billing, of New York City,
on December 19th, 1895, with specimens. She writes :—“ These came into my possession,
indirectly, from the representative of the estate of the late Hon. ]. S. O'Sullivan, who was
at one period Minister of the U.S. at Lisbon. They are, probably, the most remarkable
collection of their kind that the world has yet seen. They stand alone too in the circumstances
under which they were produced. They were taken in Paris during the years 1877, 1878
and 1879, under the direction of the late Comte de Bullet, Alfred H. Firman being the medium.
The Comte de Bullet was, I believe, an American from Baltimore, but of Spanish-Cuban
origin and title, who had taken up his residence in Paris in the seventies, and who, fora number
of years, investigated occult manifestations with an exclusive privacy and great pertinacity."
Comte de Bullet engaged Firman for his exclusive service at a handsome rate of
compensation. The Count spent several hours of each day in his investigations; they
were made in a room specially ﬁtted up for the purpose. The full account is well worth reading.
The conditions under which he worked are given and appear to have been very rigorous.
See also paragraph 218 in Holms' book.
Yet Firman was caught in Paris apparently tricking and condemned by the court
(Leymarie's Procés des Spiriles). Maybe another case of a medium genuine at times and at
others deﬁnitely tricking—his supporters would suggest the tricking was done unconsciously.
Page 300 Fig. 438 Pars. (310) (311) APPENDIX
(3 IO) Concerning Cut-outs.
By '
cut-outs
'
I mean Extras which appear to be copies of cut-out pictures. Among
Mrs. Deane's productions are several such; some of them are illustrated herein, see p. 18,
Figs. 19 to 21; p. 23, Figs. 50 to 52; p. 24, Fig. 58; p. 27, Fig. 66A, and some of her
Remembrance Day pictures as she has herself pointed out. The last were taken under good
supervision. As regards the others the conditions are not known to me. Such 0cut-out0
Extras have appeared when fraud was absolutely out of the question. Full accounts of two
of the most convincing are to be found in Coates' Book. One deals with an Extra known
as the Cyprian Priestess, found to be a copy of a German picture called " Night,"
Borderland, Vol. II, pp. 242 and 248; and Coates’, pp. 77 to 82. The other account gives
details of the experiments Mr. J. TRAILL TAYLOR, Editor of the British journal of Photography,
made under absolutely fraud-proof conditions with the medium David Duguid, Borderland,
Vol. II, pp. 239 to 241 ; The Veil Lifted by Andrew Glendinning and Coates’, pp. 73 to 77.
In the course of a lecture Mr. Taylor said :—" Others [Extras] were as if an
atrociously badly vignetted portrait or one cut oval out of a photograph by a can-opener,
or equally badly clipped out, were held up behind the sitter. But here is the point: not one
of these ﬁgures which came out so strongly in the negative was visible in any form or shape
to me during the time of exposure in the camera, and I vouch in the strongest manner for
the fact that no one whosoever had an opportunity of tampering with any plate anterior to its
being placed in the dark slide or immediately preceding development Pictorially they are vile,
but how came they there ?
"
(See Figs. 433, 434, p 296.)
The Rev. CHARLES HALL COOK, well known as a student of and authority on Psychic
Photography, wrote in the journal of the American S.P.R., January, 1916, page 44:—-"During
experiments with Mr. Alexr. Martin, photographer at Denver, Col., U.S.A. [the plates were
developed in Mr. F. D. Storm's gallery at Denver, Col., U.S.A.] on the plate of the third
experiment there were above the head of the sitter three faces, fairly distinct, almost as
much so as my own, one being a bust of Abraham Lincoln, another that of Longfellow, and
another a miniature Oriental. These phantasmal faces or busts (as Mr. Storm remarked
at the time) have the appearance of being cut out from a magazine and pasted upon the
white background of the white plastered wall."
(31 I) Concerning double exposures.
Many years ago it was pointed out that there were certain marks on Mr. Boursnell's
prints which led one to think that there had been double exposure.
The plates in a carrier or slide are very often held in position by means of small metal
clips. These clips act as obstructions to the light and prevent the silver under them being
decomposed, the result is that the portions of the plate covered by the clips are plain glass
after ﬁxing; these plain portions produce, of course, black marks upon prints taken off the
negative, and if a plate were used instead of paper would do the same, namely, produce black
marks thereon. If, now, this second plate were used in the same slide or carrier with the
same clips in it, we should, on the second plate being developed and ﬁxed, ﬁnd not only
two light marks upon the plate caused by the clips but also two dark marks already there,
which would give us two light marks and two dark marks on any print made from this
second plate, and each of the light marks would be identical in shape and position (left to
right) with its fellow dark mark.
Mr. Blackwell has some of Mr. Boursnell's plates and I found these four marks upon
them, two light and two dark; I also found four such marks upon two out of the eighty
nine plates presented to the B.C.P.S. by Mr. Woolley. I received pemiission to make use
of one of these Boursnell plates in this book. I am speaking of plates bearing Extras.
Fig 438
APPENDIX. Par. (312) Page 301
It was maintained by some that the second mark was due to a fault in the slide, but it so
happens that the plate lying in the library of the B.C.P.S., from which the illustration
Fig. 438 is produced, shows one of the clips with an accidental ﬂaw in it which identiﬁes it.
It will be noticed that this particular clip with its ﬂaw appears twice, viz., once black and
once white, both in the same position (right and left).
The illustration (Fig. 438) shows the edge of the plate natural size and alsoeenlarged.
Mr. Blackwell informed me that after the discussion mentioned, in order to avoid further
trouble, the clips were removed and the remaining plates at the College are free from clip
marks either white or black, but some of them show double rebates which is equally good
evidence of double exposure.
It is curious that among the Boursnell plates in Mr. Blackwell's possession I have seen
one or two non-psychic Boursnell negatives, that is. plates used for non-psychic portraits
and containing no Extras, which also bear the black and white clip-marks.
As I think that in a research of this kind, to ﬁnd the origin of such photographs, every
feature found should be reported, I have drawn attention to these clip-marks. I cannot
myself conceive how prints can carry two white clip marks and two black ones unless a
second plate has been treated as suggested above ; but how to account for the normal non
psychic photographs also having the black and white marks ?
It the Boursnell psychic photographs are genuine and Mr. S. W. Woolley's evidence
shows conclusively that they are, these clip-marks are further evidence that some psychic
photographs are produced by the operating intelligence in a mundane manner with the use
of ordinary mundane material and that in this case Mr. Boursnell's slide was used.
It will be remembered that these Boursnell plates are all half-plate size, precluding the
possibility of substitution, and were used in the presence of a young and most capable
investigator (Mr. Woolley) who brought his own plates, took them away with him and
developed them at his own home.
In Psychic Science of July, 1927, Mr. S. De Brath in an interesting article on Super
normal Photography, writes concerning Mr.
‘S.
W. WOOLLEY :—
"
This gentleman
is
an experienced photographer and chemist, who set himself
the task of examining Boursnell's mediumship with the view to discover its genuineness
or otherwise, and
if
possible the method of production of the phenomena
if
he were
convinced of their supernormality. Mr. Woolley shows
a
thorough knowledge of the
tricks by which results can be artiﬁcially produced. He writes :—
0In regard to the authentiﬁcation of the photographs, the control which
I
exercised was never relaxed, but
I
cannot, at this distance of time, give anything
deﬁnite regarding a particular print.
I
took my own plates, previously marked,
placed them in the dark slides at Mr. Boursnell's, examining the slides well, and,
after exposure, took them out and brought them home with me for development.
This procedure was only varied
a
few times in the earlier photographs, the
alteration being. that in my presence the negatives were developed, ﬁxed, and
partly washed.
I
took them home in grooved boxes, completing the washing at home.
Mr. Woolley told Mr. De Brath that the plates were not handled by Boursnell at all.
" Mr. Woolley states that
'
In no case were the supernormal appearances which sub
sequently showed on the photographic plate apparent to the eye, and
it
is
hardly necessary
to add that all the ordinary precautions were taken of marking the plates, examining the
dark slides, camera and lens, stops and backgrounI ."
A
long account of Boursnell's work
is
contained in Coates' book and as to his genuine
ness there can be no doubt. Mr. Coates writes (p. 263)
:
"
The appearance of
0
Double
Exposure' in the bulk of Boursnell's work condemned it as fraudulent. But was it?
Double exposure
is
present in the majority of psychic photographs," and, further, "
Had
I
not known by personal and persistent study that the double effect in supernormal photo
graphy was not due to the action of the photographer
I
should have dismissed one half of
the psychic photographs
I
have examined as either due to double exposure or as the result
of assisted super-imposing." For further testimony pro Boursnell see p. 326 (342).
Some of Mrs. Deane's psychic photographs show double slide rebates. See also
P.

(272).
(3 12) Over-exposure harmless.
Exposures made by mediums are frequently prolonged much beyond the time
required for an ordinary exposure (for instance, Mrs. Deane's photographs obtained in the
open during the two minutes' silence at the Cenotaph Service) yet the plates are not over
exposed. Major R. E. E. Spencer, in the report of his experiments printed in Light,
October 18th, 1919, states that it was shown with certainty by his experiments that the
"operators" (the power producing the Extras) can prevent exposed plates being acted
upon too much or at all by light. Dr. Hereward Carrington observed the same thing in
his experiments. (See (277)
p.
286.) Mr. Stephenson also. (See (255)
P.
76.)
Page 302 Pars. (313) (314) APPENDIX.
Mr. Wm. Walker mentions (in Light, May 25th, 1912) two similar plates exposed under
test conditions at Crewe, one 375 times longer than the other ; results with both quite good.
If one accepts the reality of psychic photographs it is impossible to account for them
being produced under the conditions of time and space as we understand them.
It would seem that the plates are either protected from light or, as the evidence from
skotographs and the ﬁnger-marks found by me on some of Hope's plates would suggest, that
the plates are removed for a time in some invisible way into some inconceivable space and
there handled.
(3/3) Exlras which are Copies ofPubIishecl Piclures.
The existence of Extras which are evidently copies of published pictures naturally leads
the uninitiated to be amused at the extraordinary credulity of those who espouse the genuine-
ness of psychic Extras, and to condemn all mediums producing such, as Mumler was
condemned when one of his Extras was found to be the likeness of a living man.
Not credulity but prolonged investigation it is which forces the belief in the genuineness
of many such Extras even upon those who have studied the subject in a rationalistic spirit.
Concerning the Extras which are copies of pictures, shown on p. 24, Figs. 54, 56 and 58,
the following notes of that careful investigator into psychic phenomena, the late Major
R. E. E. Spencer, are to be found in Budget No. 71 of the Society for the Study of Supernormal
Pictures (3rd Oct., 1921).
The late Major R. E. E. SPENCER stated that he was shown by Mrs. Deane several psychic
pictures which had been produced through her and found three which seemed to be of faces
familiar to him. Major Spencer wrote: "Mrs. Deane at once lent me the three photo
graphs in question to take home with me so that I might endeavour to ﬁnd the originals.
In the case of the portrait of a man having an oval face with moustache, Mrs. Deane told
me they had asked at a sitting who he was, and had been told that they ought to know—
it was the face of a military man and they must ﬁnd out the rest themselves—no information
was given them concerning the two other faces.
"I referred to a book in my library—Celebrities of the Army (George Newnes, 1900)—
and on p. 48 found a colour-plate portrait of Maj. Gen. Sir E. R. P. Woodgate, which is the
original of the face in that Extra (p. 24, Fig. 53).
"I failed to ﬁnd the original of the Extra (p. 24, Fig. 55) for some time, but one day
when looking through the shelves, I felt impelled to take down an edition of Alton Locke
by Charles Kingsley (Macmillan). I found opposite the title-page a portrait of the author.
As to this being the original of the photograph produced through Mrs. Deane there cannot be
the slightest doubt."
As regards the Figs. 57 and 58 (p. 24) of the Red Indian Chief, Major Spencer pointed out
several features in the Deane Extra which showed a difference between that and the .My
Mag print, of which it is evidently a copy. He says this ditference would be accounted for
by the operation of scissors on the margin.
For similar reproductions, among them the Cyprian Priestess see Coatcs’ book (op. cit),
pp. 77 to 82 and 87 to 92. For Duguid's drawings, of which published pictures were the
probable foundations, see Edward T. Bennett's work The Direct Phenomena of Spiritualism,
1908. See also p. 19 of this book, Figs. 26 to 28.
In view of the fact that photographic impressions of memory thoughts have been
produced, (see Encyclopirdia of Psychic Science, pp. 382 et seq.), one might try to explain the
psychic reproductions of published pictures by supposing them to be photographs of mental
representations of the pictures but the fact that the Extra of the My .lfag Indian face shows
signs of trimming goes to prove that in this particular instance, at least, the Extra was
not obtained from a memory image. Other Extras also show signs of cutting: see p. 18,
Figs. 19-21. These trimmed Extras seem to be proof that the original illustrations were made
use of materially, if not fraudulently then by the postulated power of the medium to act
in some manner not in accordance with the laws of nature known to us at present (see par.
(337), p. 316.
(314) MR. DAVID GOW tells (Light, March 24th, 1933) a story of Sir William Vavasour :—
"
While in Birkenhead he visited an old bookshop and bought among others Dr. Pearson's
Exposition of the Creed. He noticed a portrait of the Bishop on the front page, but paid
it little attention before ordering the books to be sent to his London residence. On the following
day he visited Mr. Hope at Crewe to test the resources of psychic photography, taking
his own plates and placing them in the slides himself. He obtained two faces, one was that
of an old friend, the other he identiﬁed as Bishop Pearson ; it appeared to be a replica of
the engraving he had looked at on the previous day. He showed me the photograph
and then he put the question:
0
Did I think that his interest in the Bishop brought the
two into spiritual contact, or had Hope in some mysterious way got the picture from the
impression in his mind derived from looking at the engraving in the book ?' He had not
spoken to Hope on the matter beforehand, and nothing was further from his thoughts than
the idea of a picture of the Bishop. What was the explanation ?
”
APPENDIX. Pars. (3140) (315) Page 303
(314a) "I pass the problem on to those with more ability to solve it. Such things are, of
course, not uncommon in the history of supernormal pictures. They seem to point to the
existence of laws of which we have at present little knowledge, but to describe the whole
subject as imposture and delusion, as some have done, merely indicates a poverty of knowledge
and of imagination. Moreover, the method of taking the results of some particular
professional medium and making the whole question stand or fall by these is a fallacy. I have
(as already indicated) known too many people in private life who get surprising results in
their own experiments, without the presence of professional mediums. to have any doubt
of the reality of the subject."
I ﬁnd an account of this incident is given in Sir William Vavasour's book Spirilism,
17.7. He wrote :
“
Mr. Hope took several photos of me, and at the time we could see other
faces on the negatives than mine, which were plates I had brought and had myself put into
the slides; on the photos being printed, on one was found a face clearly resembling the
engraving of Bishop Pearson in the book I had purchased, and on another that of an old
friend of mine that closely resembles a photograph I have in my album."
"In some photographs, taken by photographic mediums, I have had some wonderful
instances where the spirit appearance on being compared with the life portraits are seen
to be virtually identical.
(315) Concerning the W. M. Keefer-Du Ponf Lee Extras and olhers.
A very clever and cleanheaded critic of Psychic Photography was the late Dr. W. F.
Prince, Ph.D., whose opinions however on that subject seem to be based upon the internal
evidence of the photographs and not upon experiments which latter are essential in order to
form a correct judgment in psychic matters.
Thousands of alleged Extras obtained by Mrs. Du Pont Lee, a wealthy American lady,
with the medium W. M. Keeler, are analysed by Dr. Prince in an extensively illustrated article
published in the Proc. of the American S.P.R., Vol. XIII (1919). This report was
supplementary to one previously drawn up by Dr. Hyslop on these exceedingly curious
photographs and published in an earlier number of the same Journal.
Dr. Prince's analysis is an excellent lesson in observation and detective work. His
deﬁnite conclusion is that the Du Pont Lee photographs are not supernormal productions,
and yet the strangeness of these pictures leaves a lingering doubt in the mind.
This able article on psychic photography should not be left unread by any, serious student
of this subject. The same applies to Dr. Prince's review of The Case for Spirit Photography
in the Scientiﬁc American, December, i925, to be seen at the Library of H.M. Patent Ofﬁce,
Southampton Buildings, Chancery Lane, London, \V.C.2.
Mr. Hans Hamilton, a member of the S.S.S.P., who has devoted much attention to
psychic photography, speaking of Dr. W. Franklin Prince's article on the Du Pont Lee
photographs, among which were some psychographs, says :—" The writing of the deceased
Mr. Bocock, whose portrait appeared a great number of times among these pictures, was a
mixture of his own and of that of Keeler. Dr. Walter Franklin Prince concluded fraud;
but that by no means follows, as Dr. Geley said to me some time ago."
Dr. Prince was a very incisive writer ; his perspicacity was so great that readers I am sure
would like to hear his remarks upon some other psychic photographs even though they may
not agree with them. He says in the Scientiﬁc American, Dec., 192 5, and elsewhere :—
"
Mumler's Extras were very often rheumatic or ossiﬁed, which would lean upon a
sitter like a log, while some other photographers attract healthy and graceful spirits. Following
Mumler appeared a type of Extra consisting of a face only, fading out at the edges in moony
fashion, a type still often seen.
“ There have been photographers like Boursnell whose spirits appeared impelled to wrap
themselves in a long mantle passing over the head. Again, this is understandable on the
basis of fancy or method of the individual camera man, but not otherwise in the absence of a
sign in the studio: 0
All spirits entering here must wear Arab costume.'
" Why do large groups of babies sometimes meet in the studio of Martin, take off their
heads and arrange them equidistantly in one thin stratum, but never indulge in this
quaint sport in most other mediumistic studios? Did spirits, not Keeler. cut out ﬁgures
from Hofman's
0
Christ in the Temple,0 trim their beards a bit, and shift them into a different
arrangement? Did his spirits copy an old picture from the Cosmopolitan Magazine?
I have an annoying memory for pictures."
Dr. Prince points out that the ectoplasmic arch or circle type is common in the Extras
of William Hope but is not common in American Extras. He also points out that in groups
of Extras the lighting is always inconsistent.
He mentions that in reviewing the Keeler-Du Pont Lee Extras he counted thirty distinct
varieties of effects which can be produced by fraud.
"
There are such curiosities as spirits
with wings, and a church which exactly duplicates a building of the Panama-Pacific
Exposition."
Page 304 Fig. 439 Pars. (315a) (316) APPENDIX.
He also states that a journal in England contains a reproduction of a photograph taken
by two boy mediums in a Spiritualist church in England. He recognises it as being an
exact copy of a portion of Murillo's
“
Holy Family
" in the National Gallery.
He then speaks of Psychographs which appeared with Mr. Hope and points out that the
appearance of the Latin words
" ob mort-es nostnorum fratr-um dob-emus
"
suggests that
the hyphens are simply to point otf for beginners the case and tense endings. He says that
Prof. Henslow printed a psychograph which came through Hooper, also containing stock
Latin phrases cribbed, he suggests, from a table, since half a dozen are inserted in alpha
betical order.
Dr. Prince proceeds to review the book The Case for Spirit Photography by Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle and others, among them Mr. Fred Barlow. Referring to a Crawford psychograph
illustrated opposite page 16 he says
"
It was written every word by him [Dr. W. J. Crawford]
but not a single sentence. That is to say, words had been cut out of letters received from
Dr. Crawford in his lifetime, and joined on a dark background to make sentences, with the
edges clouded by paint or some other material. Another specimen is so ill-disguised that the
actual straight edges of the clippings show through."
(315a) Comment—Assuming Dr. Prince to be correct, this case and those of the Latin
phrases belong to the same class as double exposure, cut-outs, etc., many of which could not
have been produced by conscious fraud on account of the conditions imposed at the time.
They are extremely important as indicating the direction in which we have to look to
ﬁnd the at present inconceivable origin of some at least of the photographic Extras.
(3/ 6) Further matter concerning the Extras of the late Mr. Hope,
Mrs. Deane and others.
On page 61 mention is made of a paper on psychic photography read before members
of the Society for Psychical Research in November, 1932, by Messrs. Barlow and Rose.
This paper hit psychic photography a severe blow. The reader may like to have the few
following facts and references in order to be in a position to form his own judgment.
For may years Mr. Barlow was
honorary secretary of the Society for
the Study of Supernormal Pictures
(the S.S.S.P.) and contributed valuable
articles to the budgets of that society.
In those years he was a strong advocate
of the genuineness of many Extras and
of the honesty of Mr. Hope and
Mrs. Deane, being ﬁrmly convinced of
the reliability of the many test sittings
held with them by himself and others.
He edited Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's
The Case for Spirit Photography, con
tributed most valuable material to
Coates’ book and many articles on
psychic photography to Light A perusal
of Mr. Barlow's various reports and
essays on the subject published
previously to his S.P.R. paper should
not be omitted by anyone seriously
interested. His change of mind is
eloquent testimony to the difficulty of
the subject.
Major Rose, joint author with
“r. Barlow of the paper above referred
to, is a commercial photographer with
the usual professional bias against
psychic photography. He deals with
numberless ﬁlms every year. He is
naturally impressed by the fact that
he never comes across psychic photo
graphs and concludes therefrom that
when others do they are not sufﬁciently
expert or sharp not to be taken in by
Fig. 439 The Late William Hope. D0" HM‘ photographic freaks or fraud. The fact
is that the persons who claim to, or are
thought to produce psychic photographs are extremely rare. Many professional
photographers possessing assuredly as much knowledge of photography (Mr. ]. Traill Taylor,
for instance) have made careful and prolonged study of the very exceptional persons by the
inﬂuence of whom Extras appear and have come to a different opinion on the matter.
APPENDIX. Page 305
Mr. Barlow0s change of view requires earnest consideration. “Vas be justiﬁed in
discarding the opinion he held for so many years and supported in such an able manner,
laying a great debt on all members of the S.S.S.P., the author among them ? In answering
this question one must bear in mind that the extraordinary nature of the phenomena, the
mundane materials and methods often connected with the production of them, the apparent
trickery often associated with them or the mediums producing them shatter, as time passes,
the certain knowledge one had previously that at some experiments made by oneself the
results were undoubtedly genuine.
Of the difﬁculty of entertaining a belief in anything contrary to life-long experience
Professor Richet wrote : —" The innumerable experiments I made with Eusapia and (iuzyk
are terribly monotonous but each time one is witness to an indisputable act of telekinesis
one becomes conﬁrmed in one's opinion and the certitude becomes more and more imperious
and yet this certitude evaporates with time. Therefore it appears to me to be very important,
after having noted all the details of the experiment, to add the following essential detail,
viz.: the conviction one had immediately after the experiment. One must write resolutely
on one0s notes
0
I am perfectly convinced that no fraud was possible.' It is that which is
of value and not the retrospective doubts which come at any moment and often without
any cause gain possession of one's mind." '
In their paper Mr. Barlow and Major Rose laid stress upon many suspicious facts;
these had been frequently published by the S.S.S.P. and were known nfortiori to Mr. Barlow;
but these facts do not nullify the most important point, namely, that the conditions under
which the Extras were produced precluded the possibility of trickery. Mr. Barlow and Major
Rose assumed fraud because many so-called supernormal effects have undoubtedly been
produced with normal means. That is the main argument of their paper. That these
normal means could not, under the conditions imposed, have been used by the medium,
has been testiﬁed to by very many capable investigators, including Mr. Barlow. The
controversy, therefore, centres on the conditions under which, with experimenters equally
expert and equally free from bias, so many Extras have appeared.
In the days before he worked with Major Rose, Mr. Barlow wrote that those who are
photographers will know that there are several methods of producing faked
'
spirit
'
photo
graphs, and an acquaintance with such trick methods is useful in enabling one to guard
against fraud. He declared that in some of the tests carried out with the Crewe circle
trickery would be absolutely impossible. even supposing the mediums were so minded.—
(Light, November oth, 1918.)
Mr. J. Traill Taylor (see p. 296 and
I).
300 (310), supported by Mr. Dennis Taylor in his,
the Twenty-Sixth, Traill Taylor Memorial Lecture before the Royal Photographic Society
in December, M13 (see Light, i924, pp. 22/23 and 34/35), and Mr. James (0oatc-s, two of the
most capable and persistent investigators of the subject. called attention to the suspicion
raising features in many Extras, yet had no doubt of the genuineness of the results of their
experiments.
As an example of the difﬁculty of retaining, as years pass, one's belief in a convincing
supernormal experience take the following :—ln the paper read before the S.P.R. Mr. Barlow
spoke of a test with Hope, given in The Case for Spirit Photography (pp. 48, 49 and 83, 84)
as an excellent piece of evidence of the genuineness of a Hope Extra.
In that book (published in run)
it
is
stated that a document containing
a
detailed account
of the facts of the case included the words
:
"
We (Mr. Barlow and two other experts) were
carefully watching Mr. Hope all the time and are absolutely convinced there was no trickery."
This was signed by the three observers, all experienced photographers, members and delegates
of the 5.5.5.1’. This signed report was made at the time, many years before the reading of
the paper. Surely Mr. Barlow has fallen into the error against which Prof. Richet warned
experimenters and has allowed time and the suggestive inﬂuence of Major Rose to obliterate
the certainty he then felt. He now recalls that Hope carried the slide (in daylight; Hope
did not enter the dark-room) in his trousers pocket, and Mr. Barlow assumes that Mr. Hope
played tricks with
it
there. It must not be forgotten that in the detailed report alluded
to above
it
states: "Mr. Hope turned out his pocket for examination before inserting the
dark slide." (Quoted in Light 1933,
p.
197.) We have three gentlemen conversant with
photographic trickery, deﬁnitely stating: "
“0e were watching the sensitives all the time
and are absolutely conﬁdent there was no trickery which, under the circumstances, would
be impossible without immediate detection." Further they say
:
"
We wish to emphasise
the fact that these results were obtained with a camera that had never before been used.
[It was brought to the sitting by Mr. Barlow.] This and the dark slides were of quite
a
different type to those used by Mr. Hope who did not handle the camera or slides until after
the plates had been developed."
Of course, he must have handled one slide to put
it
into his pocket and take it out again.
It is not likely that he could handle
a
new unfamiliar slide in such a way as to impress
a
picture on it; being
a
new slide
it
was probably difﬁcult to open;
it
is
out of all reason
to suppose that these three gentlemen who set out to examine the genuineness or otherwise
of an alleged extraordinary phenomenon should not be able to see in daylight whether
Mr. Hope was fumbling with the slide which they knew was in his trousers pocket.
Page 306 Par. (317) APPENDIX.
t/
Psychic photography is an interesting but intensely trouhlous problem for, while there
isea mass of assuredly genuine Extras both with “r. Hope and Mrs. Deane, a small portion
of which I have referred to in these pages, there are, as l have mentioned, many things
connected with both these mediums which are stumbling blocks to many to the acceptance
even of those Extras where there was assuredly no possibility of fraud and one can well
understand Mr. Barlow's present attitude; in addition to the ring marks illustrated on
p. 88 we have an incident he records which made a very bad impression on him, here it is :—
(317) Mr. Barlow was informed that Mr. McKenzie of the British College of Psychic
Science had, a few years back, on two occasions, found a ﬂash lamp with bulb attachment,
some cut-out photographic heads and some hair in Hope's hag.
Mr. Hope was not told about this or given any opportunity to explain the presence of
these things, and Hope being dead (he died on March 8th, 1933, after an operation for
cancer) we cannot come to any decision on this matter. He may have had some adequate
explanation. No verdict is possible without evidence from the defence.
We must always remember that we know nothing of the means employed by the
operator whoever it may he that uses the medium, who must be a very abnormal person,
possibly with dual personality. FRANK PODMORE, in his Modem Spiritualism, Vol. II,
p. 77, says it is difﬁcult to believe that a medium could provide himself with the means for
carrying out a fraud without being conscious of his guilt. He says "diﬁ'icult, but perhaps not
impossible, for the analogy of the 0post-hypnotic promise
'
suggests even here a way out.
We have experimental evidence that an action undertaken by the trance consciousness may
be fulﬁlled at the appointed time during waking hours, without the knowledge of the waking
agent." Dr. W. F. PRINCE wrote in the Amer. S.P.R. journal, 1916: "In the Doris Fischer
case of multiple personality the real Doris had no direct knowledge of the thoughts or acts of
any of the secondary personalities."
J. MILNE BRAMWELL in his work Hypnofism, p. 146, quotes William james as saying:
"
In certain persons at least, the total possible consciousness may be split into parts,
which co-exist but mutually ignore each other; Braid described this condition as double
consciousness." Extraordinary phenomena need extraordinary explanations. See also
l)r. Horton Princes The Unconscious.
Even if Mr. Hope had intended the articles mentioned above for fraudulent purposes
he could not have made any use of them or their products or anything of a similar character
in the many test cases conducted by competent experimenters.
The knowledge of the above discovery and that the Hope Extras had of late been small
discs (moons) with, at times, bands of light cloud joining them such as the luminous paint
disc device mentioned on page 61 produces, made Mr. Barlow very suspicious of Hope ; and
indeed it is these things which make the investigations of psychic photography so difﬁcult.
They cannot, however, annul the mass of testimony for the genuineness of results obtained
with Hope, Wyllie, Mrs. Deane, and others.
Unless means (including Mr. Barlow's luminous paint device, see p. 61) to produce by
fraud any particular Extra of the many certiﬁed as genuine by the numerous witnesses, the
record of whose evidence is to be found in this book and in the many works and Journals
cited herein, can be shown to be capable of circumventing the precautions taken in that
case, the existence of such means, or even the possession of such means by the sensitive,
does not affect the conclusion that that particular Extra was genuine.
It is stated that all, or nearly all, mediums for physical effects appear to cheat at
times. See par. (372) p. 357 on Trickery. The psychological reason for this may be found
later.
Dr. LINDSAY JOHNSON, M.D., F.R.C.S., a man of high scientiﬁc distinction, an authority
on optics and on photography, author of a work on colour photography which has gone
through ﬁve editions, wrote that he was convinced that there was no possibility of fraud on
the part of either Mr. Hope or his colleague, Mrs. Buxton, when he took a series of
photographs, both with and without his own camera, in September, 1920, when in London.
Although conﬁdent there never has been any desire on Mr. Hope's part to practise
trickery of any kind, he said one must not forget that he is a medium, and his experience
went to show that most mediums, if not all, are liable at times to cheat unconsciously, and
that they seem impelled by some unknown power in that direction, and do so without the
slightest desire to go off the straight track." (Light, 1922, p. 517.)
Mr. Hope was much respected in his home town ; as witness the crowd (running into
hundreds) at his funeral.
LADY (0QENCONNER said: "I have known Mr. Hope for close on three years, and
I have pleasure in introducing him to you as my friend, and a man of integrity and the
utmost honesty of purpose." (Light, 1919. P. 339.)
Mr. G. H. LETHEM, ].P., the well-known editor, wrote in an article in the London
[Maga2ine :
“
All those who knew Mr. Hope know that he is no magician, but just a simple.
earnest. (lodJearing man." (Lighl, 1020, p. 133.)
Mr. jAilES Dm0GLAS, Editor of the Sunday Express, wrote of Hope, with whom he
had experimented :
“
lie is uneducated. He is homely. He is humorous. lie is simple.
APPENDIX. Pars. (318) to (319) Page 307
He is religious. He seems quite artlcss and sincere. Altogether he is an amazing character."
(Daily Express, 9th Dec., 1921.)
Mr. De BRATH said anyone who had seen Mr. Hope's hands—the rough hands of a
working man—and the transparent simplicity of his procedure, will smile at the suggestion
that he was able to palm even quarter0plates, much less the stereo size or to carryout
conjuring tricks of any kind.
If it is proved beyond all shadow of doubt that some of the productions of a photo
graphic medium are genuine then all the appearances, on other occasions, of fraud as
incriminating the medium can be legitimately ruled out, as there is no knowing what power
the intelligent agency (internal or external) has over the medium, and what poltergeistic
tricks it may induce the medium to play.
An experimenter of standing in another branch of psychic phenonu-na stated that
certain results obtained conﬁrm the suspicion that subliminal selves [or whatever the
intelligent operator may be] generally are rnfants tris terribles, and up to all manner of
mischief to upset our serious investigators.
Mr. HORACE LEAF, than whom no one perhaps possesses more practical and erudite
knowledge of psychic phenomena, wrote that he had met many persons who, in their psychic
experiments, instead of ﬁnding something clear and conclusive, have discovered that there
lurks somewhere in their own being a tricky something which seems to delight in mis
leading them. (Light, 1931, p. 396.)
Mr. jAMES COATES wrote: “That mediums for psychic photography could go on
year after year, turning out thousands of identiﬁable pictures of persons unknown to them,
by deliberate 0double exposure,' superimposed printing, and blessed 'pin.holes' only the
and ——_--— assume and assert."
And re Hope:
"
No man, in my opinion, has been tested more or his mediumship
better demonstrated. It is because I know the facts of pyschic photography that I have
long dismissed the fraud theory as wholly inapplicable as an explanation." (Light, 1921, p. 91.)
The tests to which Mr. Hope has submitted himself at the hands of numberless sitters
unknown to him, who included specially qualiﬁed investigators, professional photographers
and conjurcrs, many conﬁrmed disbelievers expecting to discover fraud, during twenty
scven years of psychic work without being once discovered cheating must surely outweigh
all suppositions, even reasonable suppositions, or conclusions, based upon the various facts
mentioned in the Barlow-Rose article.
(318) Mr. HARRY PRICE, aseverc critic of psychic photography, published in Light (1924 pp.
746/747 and 758/759) a long informative article on the subject including allusion to abnormal
results he himself had obtained with a Mrs. Irving (see (276) p. 285). In this article he
wrote: "
I consider there is a brilliant future for psychic photography. I cannot believe
it is all fraud. I feel convinced that Mr. Hope has produced genuine extras." In Light
(1022 p. 565) he wrote; "
It seems incredible that a medium could consistently cheat for
twenty years and still be in the game."
(3180) Mr. JOHN WILLIAMS, professional photographer, of Rhyl, wrote that he had known
Mrs. Buxton and Mr. Hope for ten years, and within that time had had six different sittings
with them under strict test conditions, and had never come away disappointed, and in all
the cases not the slightest deception or fraud had occurred and that he sincerely believed
in their honesty and integrity. He used his own camera, plates, developer, hypo, and
dishes and in no case had Mr. Hope ever touched the plates until after ﬁxing in the washing
dish. Fraud or trickery he considered to be out of the question. He stated that his
experience as a photographer extended over 40 years and that he had taken at least forty
different prizes in England and France. He added he had the highest regard for the (0rewe
Circle. (Light, r921, p. 287.)
Mrs. BARBARA MCKENZIE wrote :—
"I have seen Hope work under many conditions, at his best and at his lesser best;
I have felt the psychic force on many occasions ﬂow from his hands ; on other occasions I
felt nothing. I have seen the emanations ﬂow about his own and Mrs. Buxton0s hands as
they stood near the camera ; on other occasions nothing. I have been conscious, as a
sitter, of cobwehby, tangible impacts upon me as I waited for the exposure of the plates,
at other times everything was
0
dead as mutton'."
In Budget No. 74 of the Society for the Study of Supernormal Pictures published in
December, 1921, Mrs. McKenzie mentions that her husband, Mr. Hewat McKenzie, witnessed
on a. previous occasion similar emanations with Hope and that he spoke of it at the time to
Mr. Hope and to the others present, including herself.
Mr. Barlow's article was followed by a debate held between him and various defenders
of Hope. An account of it was published in Psychic Science, July, 1933, from which I am
quoting here by the kind permission of the editor, Mr. STANLEY DE BRATH :—
(319) "Mrs. McKENZIE, Mr. DE BRATH, Commander (0,RlsmN and Mr. GRAHA“ MOFFAT
(who was a professional photographer for sixteen years) all showed on the screen
photographs in which the prime condition* had been rigorously applied. Mr. Barlow's own

during the experiment nor of substituting a plate or slide.

evidence was quoted. In Budget 67 of the Society for the Study of Supernormal Pictures,
.\Iay 17th, 1021, there is a very fully detailed account of a test experiment (pp, 0 and 10) by
ﬁfteen members of that critical Society, signed by them all, which certiﬁes that Mr. Hope
did not touch the plate till ﬁxation was complete. The account shows that observation of
Mr. Hope was very close. It is signed by Dr. Abraham Wallace, Colonel Baddeley, R.Ii.,
Mrs. McKenzie, Major R. E. E. Spencer, and Mr. Barlow himself, with ten other reputable
witnesses. It is testimony to the fact, which no change of opinion can alter. .\lr. De Brath
also quoted Sir William Barrett0s testimony that Hope did not go into the dark room at all
when the test photograph was taken reported upon by himself in Proc. S.P.R. xxxiv. Dec.
i924. He also showed a photograph on a 5-in. x 4-in. plate taken in his own camera and
developed by himself. In this case also, Mr. Hope did not enter the dark room at all, and
no plates of that size were in the College. The evidence for the fact was, as Sir William
Barrett, F.R.S., declared, indubitable." All above photographs bore Extras.
Mr. DE BRATH added that during experiments he had with Hope on ﬁve separate
occasions Hope produced portrait Extras without touching the plates. In the above
account Mr. De Brath also wrote 0.—" It is curious that those who maintain that because
fraud is possible in certain cases, they should set aside and avoid discussion on those cases in
which there is no loophole for fraudulent practice."
MAJOR MOWBRAY, an experienced researcher and photographer, also gave personal
evidence in favour of Mr. Hope. See also his report in Light of March 26th, 1936, of his
successful test experiments with the Crewe Circle.
Mr. ERNEST OATl-IN Editor of The Two Worlds wrote (Light, June 2nd, 1933) 1—
“ May I say that in my visits to Crewe I can single out at least two cases where I took
my own plates, bought in Manchester. The usual circle was held, in which the unopened
packet of twelve plates was handled by Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton. I examined. the
camera, took out the lens, breathed upon it, and wiped it. I examined the carrier in day
light, I myself loaded the carriers. In fact, on these two occasions, I can say that not
only did Mr. Hope not handle either carrier or plate, but he was never in the dark room
during the loading or developing. Neither did the carrier go out of my possession from
the time I loaded it until I placed it in the camera, or again, during the period when I took
it from the camera until I had developed the plate. In none of my cases did I get a
recognisable likeness of anyone I knew, but in each case I was successful in getting at least
two Extras out of the four or six plates exposed."
In a leading article in Light, March 31st, 1933, the editor writes as follows :—
"The evidence that supernormal photographic Extras have been obtained in Hope's
presence is as plentiful and as conclusive as evidence can be."
Among the letters to Light was one from the Rev. CHARLES L. TWEEDALE, of
Weston, Yorks, whose great abilities in many directions are well known and whose work
Man0s Survival After Death stands in the foremost rank. Mr. Tweedale stated in his letter
that two gentlemen whom Hope had never seen or heard of, one of whom was an expert
photographer, had an evidential sitting on October 28th, 1932, when
" Mr. Hope not only
never touched the plate, but he never touched the slide either, and never entered the dark
room or took any part in the photographic process. The only thing he did was to stand
about four feet from the camera during the time that one of the gentlemen made the
exposure." A recognised Extra was obtained.
Mr. Tweedale also mentioned a test which was given in his house when a lady used
her own ﬁlm camera (Kodak) and very good Extras were obtained.
(320) Mr. W. J. WEST, late General Manager for Scotland of Kodak Ltd, wrote me :—
I, Grosvenor Gardens, Cricklewood, .\'.W.,
Dear Mr. Warrick, 8 August, 1030.
In deference to your wishes I have pleasure in giving you a written testimony of
my initial experiences with Mr. Wm. Hope, the Crewe Psychic Photographer.
It was in my ofﬁcial capacity in June, 1914, that I was approached in Glasgow
by folk who termed themselves
" The Glasgow Association of Spiritualists." I was
informed that they were to be visited by Mr. W. Hope and Mrs. Buxton, of Crewe,
who were alleged to be able to obtain through some extraordinary psychic gift, pure
spirit photographs of disembodied entities, and as they knew little or nothing’ technically
about photography, they desired me to enlist the services of an expert to ensure reason
able satisfaction to them that they were not being hoaxed. I agreed to place my
services at their disposal and was privileged to attend the various séances in company
with two photographers whom I had selected—the one a well-known professional, at
whose studios the ﬁrst experiment was made—the other a professional attached to the
leading Glasgow newspaper.
The camera Mr. Hope used was an old-fashioned Lancaster's
" Le “erveilleux
"
with which I was well acquainted. In putting him under strict test conditions he was
in no instance allowed to handle the actual plates, either for the purpose of loading the
slides, taking out, or developing. Various makes of plates were used, all of which were
supplied by the manufacturers through me only. Each plate was initialled in the
APPENDIX. Pars. (321) to (323) Page 309
presence of a second and third party before exposure. Our own developer was used.
In the circumstances we were satisﬁed that no supemormal result could obtain;
but to our amazement, on the ﬁrst negative of a group of twelve sitters, a. large head
appeared as if superimposed over the sitters, which was at once recognised as a Mr. Jas.
Robertson, a previous President of the Glasgow Association of Spiritualists, who had
passed away three years previously.
()ther identiﬁable results were obtained of which Hope could not have been
cognizant, as the relatives informed us that in most cases no such photographs of those
obtained were in existence: moreover we were assured that neither Mr. Hope nor
Mrs. Buxton had been in Scotland before this date.
I have had innumerable sittings since with Hope, including some at the College
of Psychic Science, at all of which
"
Extras " have been obtained, mostly identiﬁable.
The conclusion I subsequently arrived at was, that Hope was not sufficiently well
acquainted with photography to enable him to produce results of this nature, even if he
desired so to do.
It was impossible to detect anything in the nature of fraud on the part of Hope and
his co-worker Mrs. Buxton, and my knowledge of them since my ﬁrst experience with
them in 1914 has aflorded me ample justiﬁcation to regard them as honourable people.
Yours sincerely,
W. ]. \VEST.
(321) Mr. FREDERICK j. CRAWLEY, Chief Constable of Newcastle-on-Tyne, who sat
many times with Hope and had twenty-three excellent results with him, many recognised
Extras, in a letter to the News-Chronicle, London, on April 8th, 1931, wrote :—
"
I have obtained psychic phenomena with Mr. Hope when my own camera and
slides were used, and when Mr. Hope at no time entered the dark room."
Mr. Crawley brought to bear on the subject the training of the detective, for he was
formerly a member of the C.I.D. of Scotland Yard, and at one time its representative on the
Continent.
In Light, 1928, p. 122 is to be found a lengthy account of his experiments recording
that he obtained six Extras of his late wife. at dillerent ages, and other recognised Extras—
twenty-three extras in all, through Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton.
The above is the testimony of a detective with experience in photography ; on p. 315
(3301,) I give the testimony of a portrait painter ; on p. 311 (328) that of an Identiﬁcation
Ofﬁcer—a professional photographer; I could add that of the skilled conjuror Mr. W. jeffrey
(Light, i922, p. 517).
In the volumes of Light one can ﬁnd a great number of contributions on the subject of
psychic photography and the Crewe Circle.o I will mention just a few I have come across.
(322) The late MR. WILLIAM \VALKER was one of the pioneers of psychic photography
investigation: he had had over forty years' experience with the camera, had won many
prizes at photographic exhibitions and was President of the Buxton Photographic Society.
He said that in pursuit of his evidences in psychic photography with the Crewe Circle he
had travelled well over 3,000 miles. He was ﬁrmly convinced of the genuineness of Hope's
Extras. He obtained under excellent conditions the ﬁrst coloured (Paget Process) psychic
photo. The lengthy report in Light January 23rd and 30th, 1915, of a lecture given by him
should be read.
This coloured Extra with the conditions under which it was obtained is an outstanding
piece of evidence for psychic photography.
Mr. Gow, the then Editor of Light, wrote of Mr. Walker, that he pursued his investigation
with excellent judgment and a full sense of responsibility. Mr. James Coates wrote of him
that he was eminently qualiﬁed to investigate psychic photography, on account of his
knowledge of photography and keen insight into all aspects of mediumship and that few
knew better its peculiarities and limitations. (Light, i015, pp. 362, 375.)
(323) Mr. .-'\. W. ORR wrote an article, published in Light, April 26th, 1913, giving an
accoun0. of a test made with the Crewe Circle. This is extremely good evidence. A sceptical
friend, a professional photographer, Mr. Ward, " marked a plate and placed it in two light
proof envelopes, both of which he sealed and secured so that they could not be opened without
detection." Mr. Orr took the packet from him, and a few days later, with Mr. Walker of
Buxton, attended a sitting with the Crewe mediums. The control desired that he should
place the packet between the hands of the medium, Mr. Hope; the other three, viz,
Mrs. 13., Mr- Walker and Mr. Orr, placing their hands on those of the medium. The control,
after a few seconds, said that, as the person who had sent the plate was a great doubter, he
had imprinted the words
'
Second Thomas
'
on the plate." .\lr. Orr took the packet to his
sceptical friend, who, after examining the packet carefully, expressed himself satisﬁed that
the envelope had not been tampered with. Mr. Ward developed the plate. On it appeared
the words
"
Second Thomas
"
and also the signature Mr. Orr's friend had ﬁrst written upon it.
It is to be noted that no other person touched the plate than Mr. Ward, the pro
fessional photographer. It seems absolute proof of some abnormal power and, as Mr. Orr
remarks, " What is of no less importance, it incidentally proves the bonaﬁdes of the medium."
* See page 381.
Page 310 Pars (324) to (326) APPENDIX.
Mr. Orr then gives particulars of another successful sitting he held with Mr. Hope.
(324) Among evidential cases the Haigh Extra is considered to rank very high. A full
description of the occurrences connected with it and the Extras associated with it is to be
found in Coates' work, pp. 229-238. The proceedings were controlled by Messrs. Coates and
jeﬂrey. Of Mr. (0oates’ ﬁtness for such a task I need not speak. I may, however, usefully
supplement the account referred to with the statement that Mr. jeﬂrey was the president
of the Glasgow Society of Magicians. Of him Mr. Lethem wrote in Light, june 5th, r92°:
" He is as keen a conjurer as ever, but he is ready to tell all and sundry that the Crewe
Circle spirit photography is beyond the conjurer's art." Hope was the medium.
Major R. E. Ii. SPENCER, a very cautious and experienced researcher, wrote :—
"
l have purposely, when experimenting with Hope, watched with the greatest care for any
fraudulent practice. I have never found any, though I have sat with him and Mrs. Buxton
many times. At all these sittings I have supplied my own plates, have marked them, and
ﬁlled the slides and developed and ﬁxed the plates myself. To my certain knowledge the
plates were not touched by Mr. Hope. I have obtained recognised faces in two instances,
and in two other cases faces that I think are those of people I have known. I have a
practical knowledge of photography and microscopy." (Light, 1921, p. 270.)
Mr. Fred Barlow contributed to Light, May 5th, 1923, an appreciation of the late Major
Spencer as a scientiﬁc investigator, and stressed the extraordinary thoroughness of his work.
And now a few words about Mrl. Deane.
(325) In October, 1920, Mr. Barlow arranged that Mrs. Deane and one of her daughters should
pay him a visit for two days at his home in Birmingham for test sittings for photographic
Extras. How satisﬁed Mr. Barlow was with the results of these experiments can be learnt
from a perusal of the account he contributed to Coates’ Photographing the Invisible (second
edition pp. 254-259) where the large Extra obtained is illustrated.
On this occasion he obtained what he then considered ( The Case for Spirit Photography,
p. 8|) to be an excellent Extra of his own father. Mr. Barlow now thinks he was mistaken. How
many chances are there in a million that ﬁrstly any face so like his own father should appear of
all those possible, and secondly on a plate provided by Mr. Barlow, and thirdly in his own home?
Concerning this visit to Mr. Barlow, Mrs. Deane wrote to me on july 2lst, 1933 :—
(326)
“
Dear Mr. Warrick—Jn accordance with your request I am putting in the form of a
letter a short account of the visit I paid to Mr. Fred Barlow with one of my children in
October, 1920, when I stayed at his house two days. Mr. Barlow had invited me in order
that he might investigate my production of supernormal photographs. At that date I had
been taking photographs for three months only and knew little of photography. Before
July, 1920, 1 had taken one or two photographs only by means of a camera I bought for 9d.
" It was a sorry day for me when I discovered this photographic power. My life has
lost all its ease and serenity. Before that I was respected and happy in my work, though
poor ; and to-day I am poor and look back on twelve years of worry and trouble and am a
cock-shy for any newspaper penny-a-liner.
"I cannot understand Mr. Barlow saying now that every Extra face which has appeared on
plates used by me has_ been put there by me fraudulently. In those days I was unsuspicious
and not resentful of enquiry nor fearful of accusations. I had no knowledge then of the
length the sceptic will go in his treatment of an unfortunate medium, as I am called. I put
no obstacle in Mr. Barlow's way but was willing to accommodate myself to his every wish.
Mr. Barlow knows that during this visit he frequently used his own camera and his own
plates which had not been in my keeping nor handled by me at all, doing the developing
himself, and that he was perfectly satisﬁed with the genuineness of the Extras which appeared
on his own plates. These experiments should be sulﬁcient to convince anyone that it was
impossible for me to have produced the effects by trickery.
" In addition, however, I would call your particular attention to the following incident
which Mr. Barlow publishedo and no.one can explain away. Mr. Barlow said he would
like to have a group photograph of himself and his wife with myself and daughter before
we left. He had a half-plate camera (I possessed no half-plate camera. slide or plate) and
a half-plate and without any thought of an Extra but simply to obtain a souvenir group
photograph, Mr. Barlow took a photograph of the four of us by means of his half-plate
camera, making the exposure himself from his seat by means of a thread.
" Two large Extras appeared upon this plate, one above me which I recognised as my
0
guide.'
" Now it is a curious fact, and Mr. Barlow has published it, that I strongly pressed
upon Mr. Barlow to allow me to be seated otherwise than he had placed me, but Mr. Barlow
would not permit the change; yet my
0
guide' came above me in the picture.
" Surely this half-plate picture, taken on the spur of the moment and in Mr. Barlow's
own house, cannot be questioned.
"Once again, Mr. Warrick, I assure you I have never consciously deceived sitters;
I admit that many of the results obtained through me (in a way I have not the least inkling
of) have every appearance of having been produced by trickery but I do no more understand
how or why than you do.
' Coates op cit pp. 254 to 259 illustrated.
APPENDIX. Pars. (327) to (329) Page 31 I
" I forgot to mention that one of the Extras which came during this visit was recognised
by .\Ir. Barlow as his father. This Extra was shown to Mr. Barlow's young son who was
asked whether he recognised the face. The child did recognise it without the least
hesitation as that of his grandfathero who had died.
" Yours truly, (Signed) A. E. DEANE."
None who remember the tests to which she (Mrs. Deane) has submitted in her short
career, the tests in the College of Psychic Science by noted photographers, tests made by
Mr. Fred Barlow in his own home; the photograph of Barlow's father; the Knight and
(lushman photographs, can for a moment doubt the genuineness of her mediumship. No
photographer can tell how these photographs are produced, and yet they come."
(james Coates, Light, 1924, p. 771.)
(327) A reproduction of the group photograph alluded to in Mrs. Deane's letter is to be seen
on p. 259 of Coates' Photographing the Invisible (2nd edition) and this is what Mr. Barlow
wrote thereon :
" This is a beautiful psychic picture and wonderful evidence. In this instance
no séance was held immediately before the photograph was taken and the whole of the
procedure only occupied a few minutes. It was taken on my own suggestion and, as already
mentioned, only my apparatus was used and the whole of the operations (as regards the normal
part of the picture) was carried out entirely by myself. Even had deception been attempted
it could not possibly have succeeded, and the result itself rules out trickery."
It appears that the half-plate used at this sitting was included in a packet of
plates which Mr. Barlow forwarded to Mrs. Deane for magnetisation before Mrs. Deane's
visit to Birmingham, but as Mr. Barlow had arranged for Mrs. Deane to visit him at
Birmingham for the express purpose of testing her powers it is not conceivable that Mr.
Barlow, the Secretary of the Society for the Study of supernormal Pictures, did not seal the
packet in such a way that any opening of it by Mrs. Deane would not have been detected.
If Mrs. Deane were tricking would she venture to tamper with such a packet knowing
with whom she was dealing and the likelihood of secret indicators ? Surely it is out of the
question. No one would venture on such a hazardous project. Besides this there was the
following added danger—there was no certainty of the plates being used. It was 1th. Barlow's
suggestion that the plate should be used. Had it not burn, it would have been left with him and
rmy Extras photographed previously on to the plate would have been dlscovereri later when the
pum- wns used.
I have dealt with the Barlow-Rose paper at such length because matter reported in the
Proceedings of the S.P.R. will endure. I must not, therefore, omit to speak of the reference
in that article to a letter of Hope's in a weekly spiritualistic journal as containing a series of
nus-statements. In future years this will be brought forward as conclusive against Hope's
honesty and used to annul the twenty-seven years of his work in the ﬁeld of psychic
photography.
The letter appeared in Psychic News of Dec. 3rd, i932, and readers should refer thereto
and judge for themselves. In a preface to the letter the editor stated that in the previous
week's Psychic News appeared an announcement that Mr. Hope was to be
"
exposed
" at a
meeting of the S.P.R. This naturally incensed Mr. Hope and in his communication to that
journal he was perhaps not as careful as he might otherwise have been. It is the stupid
letter (with, it is contended, some errors of fact) of an aged, angry, ill-educated man, in a
state of ill-health. He passed away within a few months.
(328) Mr. W. T. LINGWOOI) SMITH, professional photographer, wrote (see Faces of the Living
Dead, p. II, from which I am quoting):—
"In the year 1874 I was apprenticed to a photographer and carried out studio
work for 14 years before joining the South Australian Criminal Identiﬁcation Department
as photographer and ﬁnger-mark expert, where I served 24 years. When ﬁrst shown
spirit photographs scepticism naturally overcame me. My wife and I then had our
photographs taken by Mrs. Deane. We were present in the dark room and saw all
the work from A to Z, and saw the Extra develop on the plate. The Extra photograph
proved to be that of my father, who died many years ago. There is no photograph of
him in existence; he was never known to have had one taken."
(329) Dr. ALLl-IRTON (0USHMAR Director of the National Laboratories of Washington, I).C.,
having lost his daughter, took an interest in psychic phenomena and without the aid of any
Medium obtained in his family circle, by automatic writing, letters from his lost child.
A perusal of Coates' work Photographing the Invisible led the family to discuss the
question of obtaining a psychic photograph ; the deceased daughter expressed her willingness
to co-operate; and so, with a view to obtaining such a photograph, Dr. Cushman, his wife
and son, came from America to London, where the best mediums for psychic photography
are to be found, without however making any appointment or imparting their intention to
anyone.
On arriving in London they immediately paid a surprise visit to the British College of
Psychic Science, to have a sitting with Mr. Hope.
' For corroboration of this sec Light of Aug. 10th, 1921, and Oct. .28th, 1922.
Page 312 Par. (330) CONCERNING RECOGNITIONS
It was rather late in the day ; Mr. Hope (whom they expected to ﬁnd there) had gone
and Mrs. Deane was packing up. She was, however, willing to give a sitting. She had four
plates left. An Extra appeared on each plate—three of them indeﬁnite. On the fourth was
the portrait of their deceased daughter, referred to by Mr. Gow.
Mr. DAVID GOW, that very cautious and experienced authority on psychic matters,
for many years editor of Light, wrote on the Cushman photograph (Nov. 11th, 1932) :~
"
I give the story in brief outline. Dr. Cushman's account is full and circum
stantial. The photograph was a clear and unmistakable likeness; it was recognised
by the family and friends. I do not think I ever came across a stronger case. Even
if it stood alone it would bring conviction to any reasonable mind ; combined with the
multitude of other cases of the same kind it amply proves the reality of supernormal
pictures."
The particulars of this extraordinary case are well known to all who take an interest in
psychic photography. I have summarised it in a few words. The full report is to be found
in Light of May l3th, 1922, and in the journal of the A.S.P.R., Vol. XVI., 1922; also in
Faces of they Living Dead, see also p. 313 (330a).
Mention must not be omitted of a report (with details of the traps employed and results
obtained) published by the Occult Committee of three members of the Magic Circle, presented
May nth, 1922, in which Mrs. Deane is accused of deliberate trickery. The author's view
is that no person in a normal state would venture to do the things she was accused of.
Who would venture to steam open a packet of plates without fear of detection, even without
the added likelihood of traps?
Besides, one or two experiments are useless for the investigation of mediums for
physicaleffects; a long series is necessary, such as were carried out with Eusapia Paladino and
Eva C. Many mediums for physical effects (which include psychic photography), it appears,
do sometimes cheat (see Trickery, p. 357) just as kleptomaniacs unwittingly sometimes steal
and persons subject to hysteria oft<times deceive, all unknown to themselves. It must
always be remembered that deﬁnitely non-fraudulent results have been proved with both
Mrs. Deane and Mr. Hope, as with Mr. Wyllieand others.
Before concluding, I would like to pass some more remarks on the popular view that
cut-outs, copies of prints, etc., prove psychic photography to be simply a matter of fraud.
Supposing, for the sake of the argument, that the Deane Cenotaph photographs consist
of faces of living athletes and others published in the press, is it likely that Mrs. Deane
would in her normal state make use of such well-known, surely-to-be-recognised faces?
It seems most unlikely.
Would Mrs. Deane in her normal state make a picture out of cotton wool and cut-out
faces and use it on the occasions of the religious services on November 11th ? It seems most
unlikely.
Would she use a portion of one Remembrance Day Deane Extra for another photograph
a few days afterwards ? It seems most unlikely.
Would Mrs. Deane deliberately in her conscious state copy the picture on the front
cover of a well-known magazine on view for weeks on the bookstalls and expect to pass it
oﬂ as a. psychic photograph and not to be found out? It is unreasonable to think so.
Would Mrs. Deane year after year continue to deceive Miss Stead, her best friend ?
It is impossible to believe it.
Would Mrs. Deane allow me access to all her plates, knowing me to be an investigator
free from emotional bias and using every means to get to the bottom of the mystery?
It seems most unlikely.
Would Mrs. Deane be so wicked as to fake Cenotaph photographs? It is impossible
to believe it.
Would Mrs. Deane dare to carry on such atrocious, unfeeling deceit with the chances
a thousand to one that she would be found out and run the risk of much unpleasantncss
from the people in her district where she has dwelt for many years. It seems most unlikely.
Would Mrs. Deane give sitters prints which contain obviously cut-out paper Extras
if she was using them fraudulently? It is impossible to think so.
(33 0) Concerning Recognilions.
Some students of psychic photography place no great value upon the likeness of l'lxtras
to persons known to the sitters; to many others such recognitions appear to be of great
moment. Consider the number and great variety of human faces one meets in a busy
London street. How often does a Londoner see a face in the street remotely recalling a
relative ? Very, very rarely; yet we have numberless cases of psychic Extras where the
face is recognised by all the relatives and all the persons consulted who knew the deceased
in life. Surely, the chances are too great against such a thing occurring frequently, as it
has done.
Is it maintained that it is impossible to admit the recognition of a prominent public
man, for instance, Mr. Winston Churchill or Mr. Lloyd George, whose features are well
known to the public, if a distinctive likeness of one of them appeared as an Extra? It is
true that there might be pictures somewhat resembling these but I imagine that the odds
RECOGNITIONS. Pars. (3300) (330b) Page 313
of their coming by pure chance, at at Hope sitting in the presence of a relation, is so remote
as to be negligible, and the chances against such coincidences increase with the number of
them; yet reliable recognitions of Extras are very numerous.
Dr. \V. F. Prince doubts whether reliability can be placed on recognitions. [Surely this
reliability depends upon the number of recognitions recorded and the characters of the
witnesses. Alfred Russel Wallace and Sir “Vm.(0rookes should bcconsidered good witnessesrlmth
recognised near relations in psychic Extras; and one of hundreds, is not Mr. Lingwood Smith,
a Criminal Identiﬁcation Ofﬁcer (see above) a good witness ?] He points out differences which
others have remarked between the life portrait and the Extra of Dr. (0ushman's daughter,
the Extra representing a much older face than that of a girl of ﬁfteen
[it
must be remembered
that this Extra
is
said by the family to represent Dr. Cushman's daughter as she looked
when very ill; many i0lxtras have represented the deceased when very ill; an important
point bearing on the possible source of the pictures]. See journal of the American S.P.R.,
Vol. XVI,
P.
339. etc., for Dr. Walter Franklin Prince0s criticism.
()n p. 342 he writes:
“
If, however, under conditions as absolutely preserving the
Imonymily of the sitters as in the case of Dr. and Mrs. Cushman, Mrs. Deane were able to
produce twenty, ten or even live Extras out of a hundred trials as clear andas satisfying
in their likeness to deceased relatives as in the above case, conviction of their supernormal
origin could not well be avoided." [An impossible demand in view of the well-known
capriciousness and uncontrollability of all psychic phenomena.)
In the same volume, page 39r,
is
printed a reply from Dr. Cushmau to this criticism;
among much other matter Dr. Cushman says
:
" l
go to London unheralded and unknown,
I
happen in and ﬁnd Mrs. Deane; in
a
few minutes
I
am looking at a freshly developed
negative that bears on
it
a
beautiful picture of my dead child. It did not purport to be
a
picture of her,
it
was one."
(330a) Concerning this l-Ixtra Sir Uliver Lodge wrote (ibid.
p.
287) to Dr. Prince
:
"
How
to account for the result in any normal manner under the actual conditions
is
beyond me, and
it
seems to satisfy the test laid down by Mr. Whatcly Smith as crucial. No one instance
can really be held to settle a question of this importance, but every stick contributes to the
strength of
a
faggot. and this seems to me a particularly thick one."
Here
is
what the cautious editor of The Case for Spirit Photography said in that
work, (pp. 70-71)
:
“
Apart altogether from any question of test conditions, however,
there are certain results which, in themselves, afford deﬁnite proof of their genuine
nature.

refer0 to those recognised psychic likenesses obtained by sitters who are quite
unknown to the sensitiyes and who have secured results which could not possibly have been
prepared in advance. One such case would be sufﬁcient to establish the reality of psychic
photography. It is no exaggeration to say that this has actually occurred on scores of
occasions, and, in consequence. the evidence for the truth
of
psychic photography is awr
whelming [Italics in the original]. These claiming
a
likeness between the supernormal
ctiect and some near relative or friend, who has crossed the border, are in
a
better position,
from their knowledge of that person, to speak with authority on the question of recognition
than those who never saw the original. This question of recognised likenesses
is
a point
the critic tries to evade. The reader can judge of the value of this evidence from the few
illustrations in this booklet which are tvpical of hundreds of similar results."
In The Case for Spirit Photography ﬁfty recognitions are given.
In Psychic Scicnce several recognitions are reported and blocks of the Fxtras and
the corresponding life portraits are presented.
Mr. DAVID (10w. highly esteemed for his acumen and caution, for many years editor
of Light, wrote (“arch 3rd, 1933)
:

which strikes me as a piece of slap-dash criticism; for while
it
is
true that
many foolish people wrongly identify cloud forms as portraits of relatives, some Extras are
so clear and deﬁnite as to be unmistakable portraits
;
and this has happened in cases where
the sitter was a complete stranger to the medium."

A
portrait painter should be
a
good judge of likeness. .\lr. BERNARD .\llfNN had
been invited to paint a portrait of the late Hon. F.. \V. Tenuaut, who lost his life in the
war. lie said (Light, Feb. 3rd. 1033)
:
" In
a
Féance which Lord and Lady Glenconner had
with William Hope,
a
head of their son appeared as an Extra which was a good likeness,
yet it did not resemble any of the existing pictures or photographs which had been placed
in my hands to assist me in painting the portrait. The impression
it
gave me was of a face
without light and shade—being unlike either a drawing or a photograph."
Mr. COATES, on page 240 of his book frequently mentioned, writes with reference to a
psychic Extra of his wife: "The psychic production
is
painfully like the original before
she was compelled to take to her bedroom for the last time."
Page 314 Pars. (331) to (334) RECOGNITIONS.
(331) Another excellent example of a recognition is reported in Psychic Science, Vol. \'I,
july, 1027.
LADY GLENCONNER obtained through Hope an Extra of a young man unknown to her.
At a sitting with Mrs. Leonard, .\lr. & Mrs. HEWAT MCKENZIE were told by their son
(deceased) through Feda, the Control, of the existence of above Extra and that it was of
himself. On receiving a print from Lady Glenconner. they at once recognised the portrait.
Lady Glenconner had never heard of Lieut. McKenzie and knew his parents but slightly.
Miss STEAD wrote in Light, Dec. 16th. 1032. concerning an Extra of her mother,
who died in August, 1932 :
"
Only this last week she has been able to give me a picture of
her face, accompanied by that of my father also. The plates were marked ; they were never
in the hands of the medium, .Mrs. Deane. I loaded the slide. It was absolutely a test
séance. and the evidence is unquestionable."
.\lr. ].-\.\ll-IS COMES, a most reliable witness, wrote in Light, March 31st, 1933 :
"
I have had at four different sittings with Hope identiﬁable pictures of the late Mrs. Coates,
not one of them being a copy of a photograph or painting."
(332) In the case of two sitters. sisters, (plates marked by the Imperial Dry Plate Co.,
one of the ladies acquainted with the process of photography) the Extra obtained was
recognised as an aunt who passed over quite thirty years ago. They write:
"
An old
photograph of her showing the position and expression of the face seems to us almost
identical with the face on the Extra." (Psvchic Science, Vol. II, p. 143.)
The pictures are reproduced side by side. In the life photograph the right eye is much
more open and looks larger than the left eye. This characteristic is also shown in the Extra.
It is stated:
" At the séance previous to the exposure Mr. Hope gave us clairvoyantly a
very good description of our father, and the Extra is his sister."
oFLORIZEL VON REUTER, the well known violinist, wrote to Light, May 23rd. 1931,
concerning a psychic photograph which he obtained through Mrs. Deane as follows :—
" The Extra upon one of the plates (the other one was a blank) has been recognised
as the face of a dear friend of mine, Count Alexander von F , who passed on a
year ago. The face has been recognised by the Count's sister, Princess R , his
ne )hew, Count P , his chauffeur, his personal attendant, several clerks in the
o ces of his castle, as well as several personal friends.
The Count was never photographed in England, and Mrs. Deane was unaware of
the identity of the sitter, so the evidence is scientiﬁcally perfect."
(332a) Professor \NASABURQ ASANO, of Japan, gives an account in Light, 1131, p. 518, of a
visit he paid, quite on the spur of the moment, to Mr. Hope at Crewe. He obtained an Extra of
a girl's face which he states is clearly recognisable as that of his cousin who died about eight
years previously. This japanese girl had never once left her own country. Mr. Hope took
another photograph of a japanese friend of the Professor, and his two sons who accompanied
him; over their heads appeared the face of his (the friend's) own daughter. At the time
she was in Tokyo 1.2,000 miles away. [Thought-forms ?]
(333) On page 12 allusion was made to an excellent piece of evidence which was obtained
by Mr. J. I. H., a gentleman in a large way of business at the time in the City of London.
He kindly gave me at a personal interview a full account of the proceedings when the
Extras came on his plates, and from his answers to my various questions I am convinced
there was no opportunity for substitution or other trickery, and yet the Extra. of the son
was (for this I can vouch) an exact copy (reversed) of the son's face seen in the cabinet
photograph which Mr. H. always carried with him and had so frequently gazed at.
.\lr. ]. I. H. brought his own plates, quarter-size Sovereign brand, which he had bought
in Liverpool the day before. He accompanied Hope into the dark-room, took from his own
pocket the packet of plates, extracted the two on top, placed them in the slide, signing each
as he did so. He closed the packet with the remaining plates and put it in his pocket where
it remained until it was used next day.
Of the ﬁrst day's two plates one bore an Extra, the other none. Of the following day's
plates-the same routine was followed—one showed the head of a young man, the other was
blank. The Extra proved to he a vivid likeness of his eldest son who died of wounds in the
war. The other picture is a recognisable likeness of the boy's mother (deceased) as depicted
in a life portrait shown me. An unmistakeable likeness. Editor, Light, r919, p. 40.
Mr. Vi’. T. LINGWOOD SMITH, an expert photographer and ofﬁcial identiﬁcation olhcer,
obtained with Mrs. Deane the likeness of his father, for particulars see p. 311 (328).
See also (272) (273) (274) (285) (292) (296) (301) (321) (324) (326).
(334) In January and April, 192 5, Psychic Science published psychic photographs obtained
through a Mr. X. In the October issue of the same year an admission of trickery on the
part of the medium was reported. A certain number of the Extras produced by him
were claimed as recognitions by sitters and this fact has been put forward as showing that
little value can be placed on recognitions. Certainly one would not accept everybody's
evidence in such a matter. Some Extras are much out of focus and lead emotional people
to claim them wrongly as portraits of deceased friends. The recognitions quoted in Cuatcs’
APPENDIX. Pars. (335) (336) Page 315
book, in The Case for Spirit Photography and herein are however sufﬁciently reliable to
outweigh all such errors of judgment. When Mumler obtained an Extra of a living person,
which Extra was (wrongly) so damaging to his reputation, no one brought forward the
argument that the likeness was unrecognisable. Sometimes, illustrations of recognised
Extras have been published side by side with the corresponding life photographs; in the
quarterlies and books above referred to such illustrations occur, enabling the reader to form
his own opinion.
If the above Mr. X cheated all the time, he was soon caught out. The same would
happen to all other photographic cheats. It is safe to say that no photographic cheat
would have a long innings under the strict conditions imposed so many times on Mr. Hope
and Mrs. Deane; Mr. Hope during twenty-seven years, Mrs. Deane during about twelve.
(335) 0n Clairvoyance as evidence of Psychic Power in Mediums
for photographic Extras.
Mr. Hope possessed and Mrs. Deane undoubtedly possesses metagnomic power or a
sixth sense, whatever term one prefers to use to include a faculty of acquiring knowledge
from or about a visitor through other than the ordinary channels of sense. I have given
many examples of my own experience in that connection with Mrs. Deane and one comes
across here and there, observations of the same in accounts of meetings with Mr. Hope;
for instance, in the account given by Mr. Bernard Munn, an artist, of a sitting at which a good
likeness of the head of Lord and Lady Glenconner's son was obtained through Mr. Hope.
Mr. Munn wrote (Light, February 3rd, 1933) :
“
Half an hour after Mr. Hope and I had met
for the ﬁrst time, he astonished me by describing several intimate personal matters to me
(although I was doing my best to keep in the background)."
In Psychic Science of July, i923, p. 143, Hope is reported to have given his sitters
clairvoyantly a very correct description of their father. The Extra they obtained was
his sister. The Extra appeared on a plate marked by the Imperial Dry Plate Co. (see
(332) P. 314).
The literature dealing with Mr. Boursnell abounds with descriptions of his remarkable
clairvoyant power. He saw the ﬁgures which he stated would be tound on the plate about
to be exposed. According to an account in Borderland (Vol. IV, p. 33) a sitter asked for an
alteration of the position of a bouquet which Mr. Boursnell described as held by the ﬁgure
he saw clairvoyantly ; this was duly carried out with two separate exposures—a remarkable
test experiment. In the same volume of Borderland a sitter is reported as stating that a
spirit form was described by Mr. Boursnell in spirit robes. The sitter then requested that
she should appear in a dress which she usually wore, which was done. See p. 298.
Evidence of the clairvoyance of another psychic-photographer, Edward \Vyllie, is given
by Coates on pp. 167 and 203 of his book (second edition).
STAINTON MOSES quoted in Psychogmphy, i878, p. 61, Epes Sargent of Boston: "Watkins
showed remarkable powers of clairvoyance and I think it likely that this subsensuous
condition is the frequent concomitant of the state in which psychography becomes possible."
The proofs of such supernormal faculties support the claim for other psychic powers and
help one to reach the verdict that these mediums also had the power, as claimed, of inducing
psychic pictures—a verdict which is strengthened by hundreds of facts.
(336) Thoughtforms and Psychic Photography.
There is much evidence that mental or memory pictures, subconscious thoughts 01
images often play a part in Automatic writing and in Crystal gazing (see The Subconscious
by Morton Prince (Macmillan & Co.) and Essays in Psychical Research by "Miss X"
(A. Goodrich Freer) chap. III), see also Proc. of the S.P.R., May, 1831); and p. 319 of this
book.
Similarly, experiments recorded in this book prove that the sitters' conscious and
unconscious thoughts or memory have at times been a factor in the pictures obtained by
"direct writing" and the Extras on photographic plates. The results of these particular
experiments are listed together in the Synopsis under I), Iv, (,2, T, pp. XXI to XXIII.
In France, Commandant Tagred' in 1876 and Major Darget in 1807 claimed to have
succeeded in impressing simple thought-forms on to photographic plates; the latter a
bottle, also a cane (see Coates’ pp. 338 to 340). Major Darget's experiments are described
and some of his results are illustrated in Dr. Paul Joire's Psychical and Supernormal
Phenomena, chap. XXVI. Dr. Julien Ochorowicz also succeeded in this direction. see
p. 294 (297). In Japan Professor Fukurai made similar experiments and obtained perhaps
the best results of all, p. 103 (29!). These are fully reported in his work Clairvoyance and
Thoughtography (Rider & Co., London). Collections of the chief data connected with this
matter are to be found in Dr. Fodor's Encyclopaedia of Psychic Science under

(337) General’ Remarks on Extras.
The facts of psychic photography appear to lend themselves favourably to contra
dictory conclusions. Some of its students concentrate on the results which point to trickery
and fraud and will not consider the others, forgetting that, as Richet said, ten thousand
negative facts prove nothing against a single positive fact. Others from prolonged personal
experience and from a careful study of the published accounts of irrefutable happenings,
conclude that their acceptance of psychic Extras is justiﬁed by the evidence, notwithstanding
the results which have the appearance of trickery and fraud.
In the issue of Psychic Science of july, 1927, appear two instructive articles on Super
normal Photography, one being by Signor BOZZANO and the other by the Editor (Mr.
STANLEY DE BRATH). These should be read by anyone interested in this subject.
.\lr. De Brath's article contains an excellent review of the whole subject. I quote a
couple of paragraphs from it. Mr. De Brath says :—" No single hypothesis will cover all the
various types of photographs, always excepting the hypothesis of fraud. There is scarcely
one of these photographs that could not be produced by trickery, given the time and
opportunity for manipulation of the plates. This goes dead against Mr. S. W. Woolley's positive
statements as to the conditions of their production, and also assumes that among the scores
of competent and professional photographers who have conducted the most rigid tests in a
thoroughly sceptical spirit, there is not one who had sufﬁcient acumen to perceive whether
the medium touched, or changed the plates, or manipulated the background. This kind of
scepticism sterilises enquiry." (For Woolley's many experiments with Boursnell see p. 30r.)
That there are a great many genuine photographic Extras the perusal of these pages
and of the books and articles mentioned on other pages will, I think, convince anyone
desirous of knowing the truth of the matter ; and surely it is an important matter.
Which are the particularly suspicion-raising Extras ? Certainly those obviously
produced with mundane materials and by mundane methods—these I call class
" a."
(3370) Clan " a
" includes :
1) Those with indications of Double exposure, see p. 300 (31 I). The Boursnell double
clips (31 I) seem to show that Boursnell's own slides were sometimes, if not always,
used to make the transparencies of the Extras. I suggest that in future experiments
such identiﬁable clips be used, in order to discover whether the slide bearing the
expcrimenter's plate was the one used (supernormally?) to make the transparencies
for the Extras.
2) Cut-out pictures: see pp. 296, 300 and 324 to 325: also p. 18 Figs. 19 to 21 ; p. 23
Figs. 50 to 52 : p. 24 Fig. 58; p. 27 Fig. 66A. Some of Mrs. Deane's Extras are
obviously pictures cut out and surrounded with some material or other; see pp.
I5, 20, 16 and 27 for the material nature of the surrounds. Some of her Remem
brance Day pictures look as if similarly produced, as she has herself pointed out.
(See Fig. 60 p. 25.) (Also p. 19 Figs, 26-28.)
3) Copies of existing pictures: see p. 302 (313).
4) Freak marks produced on plates by chemicals. Of these I have many examples
obtained with Mrs. Deane; see pp. 16, 17, 32 to 36, 38, 43, 47, 48, 52 to 54.
5) Extras accompanied by surface marks on the sensitive ﬁlm indicating the appli
cation of ﬁngers and of some piece of apparatus. These I have found on some of
Hope's plates ; see pp. 95 to ()7.
.\s regards class
"
a
"
we have the above data to go upon. The material proofs of them
are available. Those who have not made a prolonged study of such phenomena would, of
course, conclude that these things are absolute proof of trickery on the part of the mediums.
It is the opinion of the writer that there is abundant proof that all these ﬁve types have
conie upon plates under conditions when fraud was ruled out absolutely.
I) Take the ﬁrst, double rebates. These have appeared upon some of Boursnell0s
plates which Mr. S. W. Woolley presented to the British College of Psychic Science.
Mr. \Voolley was a man of exceptional ability well up in chemistry and photography. He
held for ten years the position of editor of the highly technical journal The Chemist and
Druggist He took his own plates (half-plate size) and0brought them home with him for
development ; he examined the slides and loaded them himself; it is out of the question that
Mr. Boursnell could have substituted or super-imposed half-plates without Mr. Woolley
seeing him. See the concluding remarks in (311) p. 301.
2) As regards the supernormal origin of some cut-outs, we have the evidence of
.\lr. j. Traill Taylor which is irrefutable and quantum suf.
3) Regarding copies of pictures, we have, in Borderland Vol. II and in Coates' book
pp. 77 to 82, the evidence of the strict test conditions under which the Cyprian Priestess
Extras appeared on three separate occasions, and as regards the head of the Red Indian
Chief which is a Deane production is it likely, if Mrs. Deane was cheating, that she would
copy the front page of a magazine which had been facing the public on the book-stalls for
many weeks at least ?
4) Concerning marks of chemicals on plates, the conditions under which these plates
(a large number) were dealt with in my presence and that of my friend Mr. V. (p. 42), a
REMARKS ON EXTRAS Page 317
skilled photographer, convince me that the marks were not accidental nor were they put on
in any normal way by the medium and some of the freak m irks appear to show design;
again, why should the medium sometimes by means of a chemical put an arch over the
portrait of the sitter as has happened on many occasions ? (/v/). lo and 17). See Synopsis
"
L."
I am of the opinion that it was impossible for her to do it undetected. I have tried and
not succeeded. Were these marks all the
"
operator" could do to signalise his presence .7
5) As to surface marks on some of the quarter-plates used at sittings with Mr. Hope
(pp. 95 t0 ()7). marks of similar character were found by me on my own plates initialled and
loaded by me at home into my own slides and exposed in my own camera, everything being
returned to me by the sitter, my co-worker, .\1r. Stephenson, and the plates developed in
London in my presence by a professional photographer. The plates did not enter the dark
room at Crewe. .\Ir. Charles Lyle obtained similar "moon" Extras to mine with his own
camera etc., when Hope neither touched nor saw the plates, see Psychic Sm-nce, Vol. lll p. 48.
To account for the class
“
a
" Extras Mr. j. Traill Taylor's evidence alone should be
sufﬁcient justiﬁcation for our calling to our aid some out-of-the-ordinary theory such as that
of the fourth dimension or whatever the realm of invisibility or dimension beyond our con
ception of time and space may be called ; some such working hypothesis is necessary as a ﬁrst
step towards the discovery of the processes involved in the putting of these mundane pictures
and marks upon the plates.
If we can show that some mediums who produce psychic photographs produce other
phenomena which also require Z6llner's fourth dimension for an explanation of them this
theory would thereby receive additional support. If any phenomena justify the hypothesis
of the fourth dimension apports surely are such phenomena par excellence.
Mr. WHAI0l-ILY SMITH (now CARINGTON) who has made a study of the subject, stated in
his work .4 Theory of the .ilechanism of Survival, p. 70, that in his view the proof of a genuine
apport would
"
compel one to admit that fourth dimensional space does actually exist."
Now it has been proved that several mediums for psychic photography have at times
produced apports or phenomena the equivalents of apports. I proceed to enumerate the
instances with which 1 am acquainted.
Duguid was a medium for the apportage of articles from closed rooms, see Dr, Fodor's
Encyclopacdia of Psychic Sciencr; for Direct writing on paper in a closed envelope, and many
other similar phenomena as well as for psychic photographs. (Iincli'clopm0dia of Psychic
Science, p. 110.)
The great medium Madame d'lispérance produced both apports and psychic photo
graphs, see her book Shadow Land.
Mrs. Deane was a medium some years ago for Direct writing on the inner contiguous
pages of packets of paper and elsewhere with apported material as proved by me on many
occasions ; see chapter Vll and Synopsis" L." It is curious that three or four times, although
the larger mark had evidently been produced by means of a liquid, the surface of the page
touching it was only slightly marked, notwithstanding that at the time the sheets of paper
were being pressed together. See Synopsis
" V."
Mr. Hope would not let me try experiments for Direct writing on paper with him, asserting
that his
'
guides
'
wished him to conﬁne his work to photography. But I think the many
skotographs he produced, among them the well-known Scatcherd-Lindsay Johnson White
Rose (see also the Breaker skotograph p. c)9 (29)) can be regarded as evidence of fourth
dimensional power on his part, or on the part of his
0
guide.'
Dr. T. GLEN HAMILTON'S mediums produced the apport of a sheet, see Psychic Science,
January, 1934, also many portraits, see Psychic Science, October, ro29; january and july,
1930; january, 1931; january and October, 1932; january, i933.
As regards Mr. Boursnell I possess a copy of a photograph taken by himself on which his
clothed
0
double
'
appeared, as if he had left a ghost form near the sitter which the photo
graphic plate was able to register. It seems to indicate spatial abnormality on his part of some
kind. Mr. Boursnell told the late Mr. Blackwell that he saw this double of himself. ﬁee
p. 346 Fig. 455. This evidence for a 0double
'
of Mr. B. is not strong; he was, however,
undoubtedly a powerful clairvoyant.
That eminent authority Dr. VON SCH Rl-INCK-NOTZING said in his work Der li0nmpfum die
Materialisations-Phaenomena, p. 89, in trying to account for the words
"
Le .\Iiroir
"
which
appeared upon some material on the head of the medium Eva (0., that fraud was out of the
question under the conditions of the experiment and added that
"
besides. in occult literature
there are so many attested cases of apportage that one can take even this hypothesis into
consideration."
Monsieur FONTENAY, a prominent French psychical researcher, could come to no other
conclusion than that a photograph obtained by Dr. Ochorowicz in his experiments with the
medium Mlle. Tomszyk was the result of apportage (i.e., the fourth dimension). See the
journal of the Amer. S.P.R. May, i9n, for M. Fontenay0s criticisms of the photograph as
reported in the Annales Psychiques, August, 1910.
It would seem that the same theory applies also to the Linda Gazzera photographs
recorded in Fotogmﬁe di Fantasmi by Dr. Enrico lmoda, for the genuineness of some of which
Fontenay also vouched. In some experiments with that medium M. Fontenay was assisted
Page 318 Par. (337b) REMARKS ON EXTRAS
by Prof. Richet. See p. 299 (308).
To speak of my personal conviction I would remark that apart from the conclusion I
reached with my H and F results (chapter VII) the phenomena I witnessed at the Frau Silbert
sittings I attended at the B.C.P.S. convinced me of the existence of the fourth dimension,
or a region where material objects can be rendered invisible and be moved a invisibly.
For reports of Frau Silbert sittings see Psychic Science, October, 1932, April, 1923, July, 1926
and January, 1931. Mr. F. Bligh Bond put forward the fourth dimension as a tentative
explanation of the Silbert happenings.
In support of the fourth dimension hypothesis are the two following experiences
with the photographic medium F. A. Hudson. In the ﬁrst (present Mr. and Mrs. Guppy)
the sitter was Mr. (luppy. He felt a wreath of ﬂowers placed gently on his head and it so
appeared on the developed plate ((0oates’ up (it p. 37). The wreath was one of artiﬁcial
ﬂowers which belonged to the requisites of Mr. Hudson's studio. In the second there were
present Mr. and Mrs. Guppy and Miss Houghton, the sitter. The last reports in her work
(0hnmiclles of Spirit Photography, p.3, as Mr. Hudson was focussing her she felt her tortoise
shell ornament withdrawn from her hair and as he again covered the lens the ornament
(a dagger) was dropped into her lap. The resulting print showed it suspended in the air.
If by repeated experiments under strict test conditions one has become absolutely certain
that a medium is a TETRAMET (a designation I suggest for a fourth dimension-using person)
then one can never conclude by the examination of a result of his or hers whether it has been
produced by fraud or not—one has to judge solely by the conditions of the experiment.
It is the omission to take the fourth dimensional power of many mediums into account which
has led those who form a judgment on psychic photography from examination only of the
results to conclude (wrongly) that it is all trickery.
There are features in the Extras themselves which may be of assistance in elucidating
the mystery of the class
'
a
'
Extras :—
1. The fact that the operator exercises selection, in that streets, houses and omnibuses,
etc., do not come as Extras ; nearly always faces.
2. The fact that the Extra sometimes shows a shadow cast by the sitter, pp. 323 and
324 and, especially, p. 109 in Coates' book. This precludes previous exposure and
the use of a transparency.
3. The screen marks extending beyond the outline of the face.

The working hypothesis that mediums for psychic photographs are able to act in some
manner outside of the laws of time and space as known to us (fourth dimensional power) may
help us towards picturing the origin and evolvement of the class

"
Extras.
(3376) Class “b." Extras not evincing any immediate mundane material origin, but
indicating a mental origin.
Some of these pictures although not existing in any material counterpart existed in the
memory of the sitter or some other person. It may be useful to make some observations
on this aspect, bearing in mind that our mnemonic libraries are much fuller than we are
aware of, as shown by Miss A. Goodrich-Freer, Dr. Morton Prince and other psychologists.

was surprised to see, coursing backward
and forward between me and the wall, what
I
now recognised as the swarm of bees, the
drones quite easily distinguishable from the workers, and all in rapid whirling motion, as in
the morning. This scene continued to be present to me as long as
I
remained awake, and
occasionally when
l
awoke in the night
;
nor had
it
entirely faded away by the next night,
although much less vivid."
These mental pictures can sometimes be seen by others than the viewer, that
is
to say
by clairvoyants.
FRANZ H.-\RT\t.-\NN MD. wrote an article on Psychic Forces in the Occult Review, April,
1907, in which he gave many examples of mental pictures being so seen. The following
is
one of them
:
"
l
was once present at an examination of a school, and one young lady recited
Longfellow's poem of Hiawatha and Minnehaha. The story of Minnehaha made
a
great
REMARKS ON EXTRAS Par. 337c Page 319
impression upon my mind, but after a. while l thought no more of it. Perhaps a year after
wards I went to see the well-known medium Charles Foster at Houston. Texas, for the ﬁrst
time, and as I entered the room, he immediately exclaimed :
'
Oh, what a beautiful Indian
spirit colncs here ! Her name is Hinnehaha. She sends you a message of love'.
"
(337c) The experimental reproduction by means of crystal gazing of pictures stored in the
memory was carried out systematically and successfully by Miss A. GOODRICH-FREER as
described in her work Essays in Psychical Research and recorded in the Proc. of the S.P.R.
May 1889. In her book she says: "I think that a great deal of crystal gazing can be explained
as the effect of a high degree of visualising power producing imaginary or memory pictures."
.\liss Freer records how at times things unconsciously seen, or words unconsciously heard by
her have shown their persistence in her memory by appearing in her crystal ; which proves
that one may be in error in thinking he has never seen nor heard this or that. That what
we have seen is often registered very exactly and in great detail in our memory is known to
those who can visualise. Miss I’reer was able to read in her crystal an advertisement V\hich she
had passed but not taken cognizance of. She was able to recall in the crystal the heading
of the day's paper and thereby ascertain the day's date which she had forgotten (consciously),
(ibid p. 110).
It is not difﬁcult therefore to conceive that Extras, however full of detail, have been so
recorded and stored in one's memory, and the transference of them on to photographic- plates
comes within the range of the feasible and of the domain of law.
Can these pictures in the crystal be seen by others? Mr. THEODORE Iii-ISI0ERMAN says
in his work Crystal-gazing:
"
In collective scrying two or more persons simultaneously see
approximately the same vision in the speculum. The qualiﬁcation is necessary, for in none
of the best attested and detailed instances of such visions did the scryers see precisely the
same vision. This forms the most puzzling of the various aspects of this puzzling matter."
If a memory picture put upon a crystal can be seen by others (perhaps by clairvoyants
only) we should have in this fact possibly a ﬁrst step towards a comprehension of the
evolvement of psychic photographs of this class "b."
If Miss Freer had gazed on a suitable sensitive plate (in non-actinic light) instead of on
a crystal would she have produced a picture upon the plate ?
The crux of the matter is whether there is any objectivity in these crystal pictures.
This might be decided by photography. It is unfortunate that no series of experiments of
this kind has, as far as I can learn, been entered upon. The only experiments of the
kind which I can ﬁnd recorded are: one by Lt.-Col. E. R. JOHNSON and one by the late
Mr. HENRY BLACKWELL, both with Mr. Boursnell as medium. The ﬁrst is described, with an
illustration of the result, in Coates’ book, pages 112 and 113. Col. Johnson wrote there:
" It was taken under test conditions on one of my own plates." Col. Johnson regarded
the Extra (a child's face) as a reproduction from a painting [a memory picture of it ?] and
not a real person. This was in I908. Mr. Blackwell's result was obtained previously,
viz., in 1905. In his case also, the result was a child's face. Concerning this experiment
Mr. Blackwell wrote:
"
At a sitting with Mr. Boursnell I held a large glass crystal in my
hands; he (Mr. Boursnell) soon saw in it the face of a young girl. I requested him to
photograph it at once." The picture obtained (with a note in Mr. Blackwell's handwriting
at the foot of
it)
is
illustrated on
p.
277.
Readers interested may like to compare these two results (that printed here and that in
Coates’ book). They appear to be identical, even as to the reﬂections of light from the
crystal. As noted, there was three years interval between the taking of them.
The fact of the identity of these two results raises problems which only future experi
ments can decide. In the meantime, these two pictures cannot be accepted as settling the
question as to the objectivity of visions seen in crystals.
At the present day students of this subject regard the faces appearing as Extras not as
representing a spirit or ghost, but rather as pictures. Those who hold the spiritualistic
view suggest that the disembodied spirit has the power to project a picture of himself as he
was on earth on to the photographic plate. Others regard all such pictures as being thought
forms from the memory store-house of the incarnate spirit or from etheric (Akashic) records.
Good and striking examples amounting to proof of the use of thought-forms in psychic
photographs are the many instances of the appearance of Extras representing a deceased
person of whom no picture existed or as seen in illness during the last days of life,

Concerning a Hope case where a mother obtained an Extra which was similar to
a
photograph in
a
locket on her person, Mr. JAMES COATES wrote in the second edition of the
above-mentioned book :-—" My conjecture
is
that the mother had a burnt-in memory of her
boy and strengthened her vision by frequently looking at the locket." (Cf. (332)
p.
314.)
Mr.
J.
TRAILL TAYLOR (already quoted) says concerning psychic pictures of recognisable
likenesses of deceased persons
1
"
I
suggest that they are mental emanations from the
medium projected, not necessarily consciously, on to the sensitive surface of the plate. When
Mrs. Lincoln got her husband's portrait through Mumler, she probably had conjured up his
likeness in her mind and this had been projected either by her own or by Mumler's mediumshlp
on the plate. This
is
mere surmise on my part."—(Borduland, Vol. II, p. 241.)
.\lr. FRED BARLUW wrote in The Case for Spirit Photography
:

Man has observed the similarity of the lens of the eye to lenses he manufactures, but up
to the present we have not discovered the counterpart in our bodies of the photographic
prints and the system for storing them for ready reference as evolved in our big cities by
specialists for the service of the daily press.
Analogy forces upon us the view that such exist, as also other means of providing the
sense-consciousness with the materials for exercising the function of memory.
What is the present day view of the physiological substructure or instrument of memory
if such exists ?
A small book The Basis of Memory by W. R. BOUSFIELI), K.C., F.R.S., deals with this
subject of Memory. It is more fully handled in his larger work The Mind and its Mechanism
(Kegan Paul & 00.). The author supports the view that memory depends on records in
'psychical structure' and says : "Apart from the theory of Memory, there are various physico.
psychological phenomena, which appear to demand the postulation of a 0psychical structure'
for their satisfactory explanation." This psychical material he calls
0
psychoplasm
'
(p. 40).
As the basis of psychoplasm he suggests some modiﬁcation of the ether which is other than
protons and electrons, and therefore does not come under the deﬁnition of matter. He says
this substance is as hypothetical as the ether and no more so.
As the word
"
psychoplasm
"
has been used for ectoplasm perhaps the word
"
mnemo
plasm
"
might be used for the memory substance. Does ectoplasm bear any relation to
this mnemoplasm ? On account of ectoplasm shaping itself into various limbs or even the
whole ﬁgure of the human body it has sometimes been called ideoplasm.
In this connection the photographs obtained by Madame Bisson and Dr. von Schrenck
Notzing with Eva C. in Paris and by Dr. Glen Hamilton in Winnipeg (p. 288 (281)) are of
great interest; in the latter Extras are imbedded in what from the published accounts is
genuine ectoplasm (not cotton-wool).
Prof. WILLIA'M MCDOl0GALL, F,R.S. also favours the view of a non-material substance or
psychical structure as the repository of true memory. in his work Body and Mimi he out
lines in a chapter on memory a theory which he says on p. 345 :
"
relieves us of the impossible
task of conceiving a physical basis for all memory, and allows us to believe that true memory
is conditioned by the persistence of modiﬁcations of psychical structure or capacities." He
argues that in addition to the neural system of mechanical associations (producing habits)
there must be a psychic-suhstenee-memory for "meanings" among which he includes pictures.
Prof. HENRI HERGSON says in Matter and Memory :
"
Pure memory is a spiritual mani
festation. With memory we are in very truth in the domain of spirit."
The possession of clairvoyant power by many mediums for psychic’ photography
(Hudson, Boursnell, Madame d'Esperance, \Vyllie. Hope, Mrs. Deane) is a strong support
for the thoughtform origin of these
"
b
"
Extras.
No picture can appear on a photographic plate in a normal manner without the necessary
apparatus (transparency of some kind or camera or such-like) with a directing intelligence
using it. So also with psychic photographs. One cannot conceive their coming on to
plates without the necessary manipulation and directing intelligence, whether the original
of them be a material picture or a thoughtform.
We have found that some sensitives for psychic photographs are tetramets and possess
clairvoyant power (and we do not know that the others did not possess the fourth dimensional
power). ls it a combination of these two faculties which enables such sensitives to produce
these Extras? Does mnemoplasm or the psychic-substance of memory exist in the fourth
dimension or in some ultra-material substance, and have tetramets the power to make con
tact with it, that is to say, to see the pictures therein and use them ?
If we assume that the mnemoplasmic pictures are accessible to the operators through
the medium's clairvoyant and fourth dimensional powers and that by means of the latter
the actual photographic slide used in the experiment is re<employed in the production of the
Extra, one can envisage the source of the class
"
b
"
Extras and of the double-exposure
marks which have appeared with some of them under the most rigid conditions. Only
the results of my H and F experiments embolden me to hazard such a guess. There must
be some explanation of them other than trickery.
When the faculty of clairvoyance has come under scientiﬁc control and psychologists
have greatly extended its range and are enabled (maybe by some instrument evolved through
the study of psychic photography) to produce in court copies of the mnemoplastic records
of an accused or other person, the time of judge and jury will be much spared and justice
will be more unfailing. Whcn that situation arises it is to be feared that psychologists will
be treated as were the inventors of machines by the Erewhonians of Samuel Butler.
(338) Clau "c." There remain many Extras which cannot be placed either in class "a" or
class
" b," such as the likeness of Lieut. McKenzie, son of Mr. and Mrs. Hewat McKenzie,
mentioned p. 314 (331) ; the identiﬁed psychometric Extras obtained through \Vyllie,
particulars of which are given in Coates' book pp. 143 et srq ; and many other similar Extras,
psychographs, etc., to be found in the same work and in psychic literature. For these no
conjectural psychological explanation can be put forward at present. As Dr. Glen Hamilton
said of his results :
"
Back of such phenomena supernormal intelligences appeared to be at
work independent of the medium's will or desire." (Light, io3i, p. ‘347.)
Mr. H. BLACKWELL LOQ. Pars. (339) (339a) Page 321
CONCERNING SOME EXTRAS FROM Mr. BLACKWELL'S
COLLECTION.
It is well known to students of the subject that Mr. Henry Blackwell
had great experience in psychic photography. He had many sittings with
Mr. Boursnell, Mr. Hope and Mrs. Deane, also with mediums for photography
in Canada and the United States, and had a collection of some two thousand
Extras obtained at his own sittings, including deceased relatives, the faces of a
great number of well-known statesmen, writers, politicians ; also fairies, ﬂowers,
etc. (See Coates' book, pp. 84-87, 219-222.)
Mr. Blackwell was a convinced spiritualist and his long-continued practical
experiments conﬁrmed him in his conviction. He regarded the photographic
Extras as the work of the departed in the spirit world; and his experience
with mediums, photographic and other, was so vast that his interpretation of
the phenomena he witnessed must carry much weight.
He kindly gave me permission to use illustrations of some of the Extras
in his collection and described them for me. I have no right to sit in judg
ment upon his opinions in this subject ; I therefore print his descriptions in
his own words.
While leaving Mr. Blackwell to express himself in his own way I feel I am
at liberty to state that my view is that we are not yet equipped with sufﬁcient
knowledge of the conditions surrounding us or the possibilities of the spiritual
side of our organism to come to any deﬁnite conclusion as to whether the
spiritualistic theory will ultimately prevail over the animistic in this branch
of psychics.
0
(339) Mr. Blackwell's own descriptions of some Extras.
.\lr. Blackwell wrote :—
"
It has long been known that the spirit people can and do occasionally reproduce the
appearance of normal photographs and engravings, more or less exactly, and possibly for
two reasons (1) because it is easier for the spirit sitter to remember by the aid of a former
portrait; (2) because the unseen workers wish to provoke discussion of the subject and so
make it more widely known.
"
It appears to me that two most valuable points are often overlooked :—
(i)
"
That the spirit friends are frequently
'
taken
'
after having previously promised
to manifest.
(2)
"
That clairvoyants have on many occasions seen them posing for their portraits
and in some cases changing their positions. One lady was taken with me three
times in different poses and as quickly as Mr. Boursnell could change the slides.
" Promises voluntarily made to me in Canada were kept in Mr. Boursnell's studio in
Shepherd's Bush, while some were taken by W. M. Keeler in Washington, where also relatives
and others appeared who had been photographed in London.
"In accordance with a promise given by him John Knox was photographed by
Mr. Boursnell who both saw and described the old Reformer. Unfortunately, he came as in
an engraved portrait of him with the exception of apparently wearing a ﬂat hat instead of
a skull cap. The negative did not show any process or engraver's markings, but, of course,
he may possibly have refreshed his memory by studying the original oil painting. Later.
he came through a trance medium in Glasgow, to whom I was a complete stranger, and
referring in his remarks to this portrait said it was a good picture of him (thus endorsing
Carlyle's opinion) but he liked his ﬂat cap better than the one there shown. Some months
afterwards when in Nova Scotia he gave me a further interesting message through a remark
able clairvoyant, Mrs. K. de Wolfe, and I understand that he manifested through a non
professional sensitive a few years since in London.
(3390) Mr. Blackwell's niece Extras.
"
The same medium in Glasgow also described my little niece dressed in what looked
like a holland frock with a blue sash, socks and shoes, and said on my return to London
she would be taken with me like that. Accompanied by a clairvoyant friend we made our
way to Mr. Boursnell's studio but my spirit visitor was there before me, as on our arrival
mv friend at once saw her standing by the background.

A capital full-length portrait resulted, with her hands clasped and in a thoughtful
attitude. Fig. 440.

"
About
a
year afterwards she was again taken holding out her hand to me and wearing
the same dress which has been recognised by her mother. This time she was seen both by
Mr. Boursnell and another clairvoyant who was with me. She was also taken with her mother
and we now have ﬁve spirit portraits of her and all different."
(3395) [Commmt—Above (Figs. 440 and 441) are illustrations, from Mr. Blackwell's
collection, of two of the Extras obtained of his niece as described in Coates’ book, 2nd
edition, pp. 85/86. It is curious that the ﬁrst Extra was described by a medium in Glasgow
(a
stranger to Mr. Blackwell) and its appearance on
a
photograph of himself in London
foretold by her, and was seen by another clairvoyant who was with Mr. Blackwell when he had
the photograph taken by Mr. Boursnell in 1901. At the sitting in 1902 the ﬁgure was seen
and described as holding out her hand, by another lady clairvoyant who, desiring to meet
Mr. Boursnell, accompanied Mr. Blackwell on that occasion.
" A few moments later the
medium came into the room and immediately said
:
0
Why, there's your little niece,
Mr. Blackwell, and she's holding out her hand to you. Be very still and I'll take her'."
Mr. Blackwell stated (Coates’ book) in connection with each of these two sittings that
he took his own plates and, being an amateur photographer, assisted in the development,
and in connection with the second Extra he mentioned the fact that he had marked the
plates (it was his habit to initial and date his plates).
In The London Maga2ine, January, 1910, Mr. Blackwell wrote
:
" In my many sittings
with Mr. Boursnell, extending over a period of ten years,
a
fresh packet of plates has been
taken each time, initialled and dated usually, placed in the slides, the camera examined, and,
with but few exceptions, the plates have been developed immediately."
Mr. Blackwell himself pointed out in The London Maga2ine that although over a year
elapsed between the two exposures, the frock and pose generally are remarkably similar and
in Coates’ book he mentions that the folds of the dress are only slightly altered, but the
position of the arms and hands
is
quite different. One must,
it
would seem, go a little further
and say that, except as regards the hands and arms, the portraits are identical, one being
the reverse of the other, and admit that no such absolute identity
is
conceivable
if
the child
had been free to move about during the intervening fourteen months. We are, therefore,
driven to the conclusion that the two pictures were taken within a few minutes of each
other. If we dismiss the fraud theory as untenable in face of the conditions and the clair
voyances we must fall back upon pure guess work. It has been suggested by some students
of this subject (Mr. Stead for instance in Borderland) to explain the repetition of Extras
which had been observed now and again, that the operator having made the necessary
negative holds
it
in reserve. (See (303)
p.
295. Major Spencer thinks he obtained evidence
in an Extra of the use of
a
transparency (see (275)
p.
285.) In the case of Fig, 44r the
transparency must have been the full size of the plate as the pattern of the carpet
is
seen in
the original to extend over the lower part of the sitter's ﬁgure. F.W.W.]

"
Now as to the arisen ones sometimes appearing the same as in their normal portraits.
Several years ago during a course of sittings which I had in my own home with a friend—
a business man but then a wonderful materialising medium and non-professional—a number
of spirit friends, including my father, mother and niece materialised for the purpose of being
photographed. Fig. 442.
“
“Vith the help of friends I made use of four cameras simultaneously with excellent
results.
“
In each sitting the medium was photographed with the spirit visitor who was quite
visible to all present by the aid of my red lamp. Flashlight was used in each case.
“
I considered that this was a most valuable experience proving as it did that those
from
0
the Other Side
'
occasionally can and do appear exactly as represented during their
earth life. This, therefore, of itself is no evidence whatever of fraud.
(340)
"
Both my father and mother, as to their features, manifested very much like the
last portraits we had of them, but in accordance with my mental request they made alterations
in one or two details of dress." (Observe the differences in the ties in the one case and in the
caps in the other.)
(34]) [Commmt—The similarity between the above Extras and the life portraits is obvious.
Another interesting feature about them is that the surround or drapery shows straight
folds (seen in the original photographs but not in the above reproductions) such as one sees
in sheets. Now, it is a fact that close by where the photographs were taken was a linen
drying cupboard in which were folded sheets. Mr. Blackwell suggested that sheets from that
cupboard were etherialised and used as surrounds. The fourth-dimension hypothesis to
account for the facts seems more easy of acceptance. In a room below the ﬂoor where the
Page 324 Figs. 443 to 445 (Par. (341a) Mr. H.
BLoACliWEITL.
photographing took place were enlargements of the life portraits, hanging framed upon the
wall. These portraits and the sheets would have made .excellent models for the Extras.
Mr. Blackwell assured me there was no opportunity for trickery. These points in the Extras
seem worth recording, and when extraordinary facts having similar curious features are
observed in different parts of the world one begins to give them some notice. In Dr. Glen
Hamilton's experiments in Winnipeg the guide Walter announced that he had a sheet ready
folded which would appear at a subsequent sitting and it did (with its folds) covering the
whole length of the recumbent medium; see illustration in Psychic Science, january, 1934.

Fis- 443 Fig- 444 Fig. 445
(341a) [Famment—To enable each reader to form his own opinion of these remarkable
photographs I reproduce here three larger illustrations of two separate Extras obtained at
the sitting on the fourth of November, 1909. Figs. 443 and 444 are of the same object
photographed by two cameras. Fig. 445 is a representation of a second appearance of the
same ﬁgure. The sitter in the foreground is the medium.
Of the female ﬁgure obtained at the same sitting there were also two separate Extras,
to which the particulars appertaining to the above illustrations apply also in every respect.
There are several features in these photographs which are easily discernible and of
importance in helping the formation of an opinion concerning them :—
I. The faces are all exactly alike—no difference is perceptible in them in the
two pictures obtained by the two cameras—the inevitable conclusion is that they are
ﬂat pictures. (Note Mr. Blackwell's mental request that some alteration in the dress of
each should be made in the representations.)
2. The surround is not ﬂat, it casts shadows which are different in the two pictures.
Figs. 443 and 444, obtained of one and the same object by the two cameras; note
especially the dark shadow on the beard and shirt in Fig. 443 which picture was taken
with a camera more to the left (of the viewer) than the camera used for Fig. 444.
3. That the Extras were objective is shown by the fact of the surround casting shadows
as mentioned above and showing the shadow of the medium's head as in Fig. 443, and being
obscured by the sitter's body.o
4. If the Extras were of a substance capable of affecting light rays so as to cast
shadows they must each have been 2 feet to 2* feet in height—there were at least two
separate Extras seen and photographed at this sitting—there may have been others
among those in the collection which bear no date—it seems incredible that the medium
could have concealed on his person objects of such a size and put them in position one
after the other. Mr. Blackwell states that he had a red lamp. He does not state that
it was alight all the time.
5. Note the horizontal creases in the surround, Fig. 445, seen better in Fig. 446,
p. 325, which is a portion of an Extra of the female ﬁgure obtained at the same sitting
as Fig. 443. F.W.W.]
oSee the shadow thrown by a sitter's hand on to a very large Extra illustrated in Fig. 21,

[The above pictures are made from two photographs given me by Mr. Henry Blackwell,
who likewise kindly furnished the following particulars concerning them.
The photographs were taken by himself by ﬂashlight, at the house of his friend,
Mr. Glendinning, author of The Veil Lifted, well known in his day as a reliable investigator
of psychic phenomena; see Coates' book and Borderland. He was, I believe, the ﬁrst to obtain
skotographs.
Mr. Blackwell was in the habit of attending private sittings held at Mr. Glendinning0s,
a private lady medium being present. There were frequent materialisations, chieﬂy of a
boy, and of Mr. Glendinning's wife (deceased). Before these photographs were obtained
the materialised form of Mrs. Glendinning had been visible for some time and had made touches
on her husband for healing purposes. The form was recognised without a doubt by those
present, including Mr. Blackwell, who assured me he had seen and recognised her form at
many such sittings. Mr. Blackwell considered that the ﬁgure became covered with drapery
because it could not withstand the strong ﬂashlight. The medium appears to have been
much startled by the ﬂash and made much movement especially as seen in the illustration
on the right where she has apparently bent forward (.9). Mr. Blackwell held that the
excellence of the results obtained at the Glendinning sittings was due to the great sympathy
existing between the members of the Circle. Concerning Mr. Glendinning's character and
experience see Coates' book, pp. 69 et seq. F. W. W. l
(342) CONCERNING Mr. BOURSNELL'S PHOTOGRAPHIC MEDIUMSHIP.
Mr. COATES wrote in Light, Feb. 19th, 1921: "Mr. GAMBIER BOLTON, late Hon.
Secretary of the Psychological Society, London, informed me of his investigations into
Mr. Boursnell's photographic mediumship. This shrewd and cautious experimenter testiﬁed
to the genuineness of Mr. Boursnell and his work at the very time that that medium was
under a cloud.
Elsewhere Mr. Bolton, author of Psychic Force, wrote of himself that having had
experience in all branches of photographic work (including various phases of 'trick '
photography) extending over a period of more than a quarter of a century, and having been
constantly called upon to give expert evidence on photographic matters in the law courts :
"
I feel competent to advise with regard to where it is possible to introduce fraud in con
nection with the production of so-called psychic photographs.
Mr. A. GLENDINNING, the well-known expert in psychic photography, author of
The Veil Lifted, gave an account in The Spiritualist, ]an., 1904, of skotographs he obtained
under excellent test conditions with Mr. Boursnell on Nov. 23rd. 1903. Mr. Boursnell held
a packet of plates (supplied by Mr. G. who had previously taken down the number, etc.,
printed on the packet) for three minutes under Mr. Glendinning's close and continuous
observation (Mr. G's italics). The latter took the packet to the dark-room, opened it and
developed the plates, which were not touched by Mr. Boursnell until they were ﬁnished.
On all the plates (four) there were abnormal results. On one the form of a female with
a nun's headdress. The four pictures were all different, although the plates were all wrapped
together in one paper in the box.

(343) CONCERNING Mrs. DONOHOE'S SKOTOGRAPHS.
Mrs. Donohoe used 1‘plates. Many of the illustrations herein of her results
are X # linear.
A lady seemingly endowed with extraordinary power to produce skotographs has
recently become known in London. This is Mrs. Madge Donohoe. Mrs. Donohoe is
possessed of means and bears all the expenses connected with the production of these
skotographs herself ; she is an ardent spiritualist and does not put her peculiar endowment
to any commercial use.
It is clear to all who come in contact with Mrs. Donohoe that she is a lady of reﬁnement
and high culture. I give here a letter from a gentleman who has known her many years;
namely, the Editor of the high-class weekly, the British Australian 6 New Zealander,
published in London :—
"
Dear Sir, August 12th, 1931.
I have great pleasure in replying to your letter regarding Mrs. Donohoe, whom I have
known for about twenty-three years, ever since I came to England. Before that I knew
her by reputation as one of the founders of the Austral Club, a journalist and a writer of
some note in Australia, and belonging to a family which has contributed members to the
preaching and teaching professions. Among them, now, are Professors in some of the
leading Universities of the world. Mrs. Donohoe is the widow of a distinguished war
correspondent. In r909 Mrs. Donohoe represented Australia at an International Women's
Franchise Congress in London, when, if I remember rightly, we published an article about
her in this paper.
Of Mrs. Donohoe's standing among her fellow countrymen there can be no question,
and, personally, I know her to be quite incapable of anything in the way of
"
faking
"
with
regard to phenomena in the spiritualistic origin of which she so ardently believes.
It is certainly curious that the non-test plates show so much better results than the
test ones. I am quite unable to explain it, but am equally sure that it cannot be accounted
for by any manipulation of the non-test plates by Mrs. Donohoe.
Yours faithfully, (signed) C. H. CHOMLEY."
The last paragraph of Mr. Chomley's letter refers to the fact that, willing and even
desirous as Mrs. Donohoe is to have her powers submitted to tests at the hands of those
who make a study of psychic phenomena, the results of such tests are very poor compared
with the bulk of the 4,300 results obtained when her plates were developed by her local
photographer, Mr. L—.
Mrs. Donohoe has continued week after week now for some years to obtain these skoto
graphs and is convinced of their supernormal origin, chieﬂy on account of the nature of a
great number of the pictures and messages she has obtained which she considers are without
a doubt intimately connected with her personal memories and affairs. Besides (she says)
she obtained curious markings on her plates when they were developed by others before
she knew Mr. L——-. among them Messrs. Whiteley; Messrs. Parkes the chemists; at
Mrs. Deane's class at the British College of Psychic Science; by Mr. Hope, also on two
occasions at the British College; some forty or ﬁfty by Mr. Porter, Mr. L-—'s pre
decessor; by Mr. Blood, a professional photographer of Southampton, recommended by
Sir A. C. Doyle; by Mr. Gillingwater (professionally conversant with photography); by
herself at her home assisted by Leslie Curnow ; by Mr. Chomley many times, and by others.
The results were nothing like as striking and deﬁnite as those obtained by Mr. L
and, not realising the importance of the matter, Mrs. Donohoe did not preserve them
carefully and most of them are mislaid or permanently lost; the few which I am able to
illustrate are to be found on page 328.
Mrs. Donohoe submitted to tests by Major Mowbray of the British College of Psychic
Science. He obtained no results. Mrs. Donohoe is particularly anxious to have results
through me (the author) and with that end in view I have developed many scores of her
plates (supplied sometimes by Mr. L— and inserted by him in her slides) at her own
home ; at my warehouse in her presence ; at my own home ; at my photographer's ; always
there has been nothing on the developed plate except on the two occasions mentioned below.
It must be remembered that when Mrs. Donohoe uses plates for test purposes she takes slides
from her ordinary stock, which have been loaded by Mr. L-— in the ordinary way without
any special instructions. One would expect on developing them, if anything came up, that
the results would be similar to the results usually obtained when Mr. L——— develops the
plates, but such is not the case.
On one occasion several slides taken promiscuously from her stock (slides loaded by
Mr. L——) by Mrs. Donohoe were sent me and were developed by my professional photo
grapher; on one of the plates a strange unusual mark appeared.
On another occasion when four of Mrs. Donohoe0s usual L plates were developed

by Mr. Harry Price in her presence two of the plates bore quite deﬁnite markings.
If the pictures are due to Mrs. Donohoe's inﬂuence, why do they not appear on the
Donohoe plates I develop ? Has Mr. L some special method of developing ? He says
he uses the well-known pyro developer. Hardly one among the dozen or so plates she
sends weekly to Mr. L is a failure. I have used pyro and I often developed as a test
an exposed plate of my own in the liquid used for Mrs. Donohoe's plates; these control
plates of mine always developed out quite normally. When Mrs. Donohoe and l were
present at Mr. L— 's studio while Mr. L developed some of her plates nothing
better came on them than splotches such as could be produced on sensitive plates by drops
of an accelerator falling from a height. Mr. I.——— was averse to being troubled by my
attending further developments by him.
The Daily Sketch of the 23rd Oct, 1935, published the following answer given by Mr. L—
to a question put by their investigator concerning his development of the Donohoe plates:-—
“l was rather frightened of what came on at ﬁrst" he said. "Unaccountable pictures from
just nothing! Now I am used to it, but I am still as much mystiﬁed as ever."
Naturally I have suggested to Mrs. Donohoe that she should send her plates for a period
to another photographer. She replies that there is no other photographer within a con
venient distance ; that, being a very busy person occupied with the administration of some
property she owns and her own domestic affairs, she has no time to use other than the
means close at hand. She is satisﬁed that Mr. L -— could not, even if he would, produce
the many pictures so intimately connected with herself which have appeared.
Mrs. Donohoe suggests that it is quite conceivable that there are favourable conditions
under which these psychic photographs can be obtained and others under which they cannot;
and that the nearness of Mr. L——'s establishment to her and the regularity of the bi
weekly proceedings (treatment and development) may be among the propitious conditions.
An experienced authority in psychics thinks that possibly we are in the presence here
of a case of " dual mediumship," in which, as in the many instances of automatic writing,
one is used as
"
transmitter
"
and the other as
" recorder
" ; l offer no opinion on this.
Such in a few words is the position as regards Mrs. Donohoe and her skotographs.
In view of the fact that it is out of the question that Mrs. Donohoe should be a party
to trickery (had she the time or photographic knowledge requisite, which she has not) there
do seem to be so many such curious things in a number of her productions as to make it
worth while putting on record particulars of some of the most interesting of them, notwith
standing the adverse features. Mrs. Donohoe draws attention in her account, which
follows this introduction, to the fact that many of her results contain subject matter which
has obvious reference to events closely associated with herself. These probably have their
origin in Mrs. Donohoe's store of knowledge, her past history and her past and present
thoughts. Examples of these are the Australian national ﬂowers the Waratah and Christmas
bell, pp. 332 and 333, of especial interest to Mrs. Donohoe who comes from Australia.
Another out-of-the-way design is D/29 p. 338 paragraph (363). Then we have the six
skotographs illustrated on p. 334 connected without a doubt with Mrs. Donohoe's thoughts.
The reader will ﬁnd many more such mentioned by Mrs. Donohoe.
At a time when the author was visiting Mrs. Donohoe with reference to her skotographs
it would seem that the intelligent entity operating through Mrs. Donohoe made use of some
of the author's memory pictures. These results are dealt with in paragraph (364) p. 338.
o Another skotograph which appeared at that period is illustrated on p. 370 (the only space
available). No description came with it, and there seems no explanation of the appearance
of it other than the following. Visitors to Folkestone will remember an outstanding feature
in the neighbourhood of that town, a little round building on the top of a hill, known as
Brockman's summer house. Like others, the author a frequent visitor to that town,
was much struck with its isolated position, and made enquiries about it. As soon as he
saw the skotograph Brockman's summer house arose in his mind.
(344) In March, 1934. a good test was made with Mrs. Donohoe. I loaded two single metal
slides with plates marked by myself. I sealed the slides with printed wafer paper in such
a manner that they could not be opened without detection. I ﬁlled two other similar slides
with plates also marked by me ; the sealing of these two latter slides was not done so securely.
This, however, should not affect the results except as regards Mrs. Donohoe herself, for
Mr. L-—— did not have them previous to the developing. Mrs. Donohoe treated these
four plates together with two others in unsealed slides in her usual manner. She and
Miss Hagon, of
" Casa Nostra," 28, South Hill Park, i’.W.3, took the slides with them to
Mr. L-———-'s studio for development. Mr. L-—,— mixed the chemicals and poured the
chemicals on to the plates but he did not handle the plates until they were developed. As
stated, Mrs. Donohoe and Miss Hagon were present and saw everything, and Miss Hagon
reported as follows as regards herself :
Dear Mrs. Donohoe, 5th March, 1934.
I called at your house at 7-45 p.m. and received from you a packet of six photographic
slides, four of which were bound with strips of paper and sealed. The four, I understood from
you, had been prepared for the test by Mr. F. W. Warrick, and on the plates should be found
when developed his signature and the date on which he loaded the slides.

4 central marks.
We then proceeded to Mr. L 's studio. I carried the slides which neither you
nor Mr. L touched until each one was emptied and the plate it contained developed.
I broke the seal of each of the sealed slides, removed the plate and placed it in the developing
dish which Mr. L had placed ready for the purpose. Mr. L-——— then poured the
developing mixture over it and did not himself touch the plate until the impression had
appeared. You and I watched the whole time and know that any other manipulation of the
plates except that which I state here could not possibly have taken place. On each of the
six plates a clear and deﬁnite impression came, the two plates from non-sealed slides showing
a vase of ﬂowers and the head of a nun respectively. On one of the sealed plates there
was a swastika and on number D/1474 came what looked like a ﬂight of birds or arrow heads
in two groups of i3 and 4o which you explained stood for your husband's initials, M.D. In
addition to the impression each of the sealed plates showed Mr. Warrick's initials and a
date.
Each plate was developed separately.
Yours sincerely,
M. HAGON.
The result was :
The two non-sealed plates showed a vase of ﬂowers and the head of a nun.
The less securely sealed bore the swastika and the arrow heads. D/l474 and D/r471.
The most securely sealed plates bore much less deﬁnite markings.
(345) Comment—It is the same tale one has to tell with nearly all tests of psycho-physical
phenomena. The more stringent the test, the less the result.
On a previous occasion (see Fig. D/T21, p 328). when the test was a very severe one
and testiﬁed to by Mr. Gillingwater to me personally, arrow heads or ticks appeared forming
the initials C.D. It looks as though when the conditions are very difﬁcult (the obstructions
many) the operator has not time or opportunity to produce a deﬁnite picture but does the
best he can and so produces a simple form of ticks. D/T24, p. 328 was also obtained on
this occasion, on a test plate supplied by the author.
(346) Mrs. Donohoe's own account of her Skotographs.
It was in 1921, when I was attending a class for Spirit Photography held by Mrs. Deane
at the British College of Psychic Science, that I ﬁrst heard of Skotography from a fellow
student. She told me that impressions could be obtained on photographic plates simply
held between the hands or strapped to the forehead. The usual procedure, she said, was to
get a packet of plates and, without opening it, carry it about on one's person, sleep with it
(all this so as to
"
magnetise
" it), and ﬁnally holding it—preferably to one's forehead—to
ask the Spirit Photographers to impress it. I experimented with this method and had some
success, but afterwards modiﬁed it for the one I now use.
* The 13th letter of the alphabet is M, the 4th D.
Mrs. M. DONOHOE LOQ. Para. (347) to (351) Page 331
I sit twice weekly at night, in a darkness and quiet as absolute as I can achieve, holding
pressed against my face a photographic slide containing a sensitised plate. I then, through
movements (spelling out) of the slide, talk with the unseen operators and implicitly obey
their instructions. Only one plate is impressed at a time. A deﬁnite signal announces the
beginning of the experiment; another, the end.
(34 7) In addition to obtaining skotographs in the manner described, I have had the curious
experience of unexpectedly getting them through a camera. Several times when I have
tried to photograph one or more of my friends, on development the plate has shown the
sitters blotted out, a design (Extra) taking their place. Some of these results would
appear to show that the unseen operators enjoy perpetrating little jokes. Thus, on one
occasion when I photographed a young French girl who was staying with me, and whose
pleasure in the discovery that
“
two pence“ was pronounced
"
tuppence
"
had led her to
repeat the delightful expression some dozen times in the course of the day, the developed
negative showed no sign of HenriettHnly two large round discs. (Fig. D/r, p.338.)
(348) One of the most amusing skotographs I have had was in connection with a well-known
author for whom I was seeking evidence. With him in my thoughts, I held two plates at the
same sitting and sent them to be developed. When I called at the photographer's to see
whether there were any results (for I often had blanks), he told me there was something very
curious on one—a button, and showed me the negative. There was a splendidly clear button
on it. I asked the photographer to make some prints and post them to me. I asked my
friend
"
Does a button mean anything to you ? ". He said that the only connection with a.
button in his thoughts was that about a fortnight before he had done something over which
he had felt immensely proud—he had sewn a button on a pair of trousers—for himself.
I opened the envelope containing the prints, and lo ! there on one was a button and a
pair of trousers.
For illustration see p. 328, Fig. D/06. [The two holes in the button have been
accentuated] Mr. L had nothing to do with this or D/r.
During the years 192r to r92 5 I sat at irregular intervals and obtained many skoto
graphs of varying degrees of interest, several of which showed co-operation with my
mind. In 1929, after an interval of nearly four years, I began sitting again, this time
regularly, and I now have a collection of over 4,300 skotographs. They form an amazing
picture gallery, and I myself never fail to be thrilled by the wonder of them, not only
because. of the miraculous manner in which they come to me, but by their own intrinsic
quality and beauty, which testify to the versatility and skill of their unseen authors. Their
variety is bewildering. Landscapes (often peopled), ﬂowers, star constellations, jewels, birds,
hands, eyes, faces as clear as in any ordinary photograph—all are there.
It is true that since February of 1929, Mr. L———, of Hampstead, the photographer
nearest to my home, has developed over ninety per cent. of my plates, with comparatively
few blanks in the ﬁrst years and practically none nowadays. Apart from the fact tha
during the twenty years he has been following his profession in Hampstead Mr. L 's
integrity has never been questioned and that, at my request, he has signed a statement that
he has in no way tampered with the plates 1 have entrusted to him, I have good reason
for knowing how absurd is the suggestion that he fakes these skotographs. The matters
with which a large number of them deal are within the knowledge of only one person
in the world—myself. If faking is done, it must be done by me, as] feel sure any
~intelligent reader of the notes appended to the illustrations in this book will agree. I may
add that, except for our business dealings, Mr. L
other.
and I are totally unknown to each
(349) The script which comes on my plates forms one of the most interesting features of
my work. During the ﬁrst three years it was written in a simple code in which the letters
consist of short chains or ropes composed of dots. The number of dots employed corre
sponds to the position of the letter in the alphabet ; thus one dot represents A, two B. and
so on. Up to October, 1932, I had received over a hundred messages given in this manner.
But in that month Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and my husband, Martin Donohoe, in collabora
tion, began sending me the life-story of one of the Pharaohs which they had heard from his
own lips, and Sir Arthur, for the purposes of this tale, invented a new code to which he
has added from time to time, so that it has really come in seven parts. [A pity the use of
codes prevents handwriting recognition. F.W.W.]
(350) Many of the messages which came from my husband in the early code spoke of the
ﬂowers he was sending at the same time—on another plate. The ﬁrst:
“
I can send you
ﬂowers
"
reached me in August, 1930, and was accompanied by a vase of ﬂowers. Another
time came :
" I hope you like the ﬂowers," with a bouquet. A third said :
" A posy for you,
dear !
"
and was accompanied by D/2oo in the illustrations on page 342.
(351) These ﬂower gifts have lately furnished another proof that, save for skilful developing,
my photographer has nothing to do with the production of the skotographs. From the
time he ﬁrst mentioned them five years ago, up to the 27th March of this year, 1935
Page 332 Fig. D/2144 Mrs. M. DONOHOE LOQ.
(skotograph D / 21 Io) my husband never failed to send me
at least once a week ﬂowers of some sort, either in a
bouquet, vase, bowl, basket or spray. Then for four
weeks (eight sittings) none came, and I felt puzzled
and disappointed. So at last, before the sitting of the
27th April, 1935, I spoke to him saying what pleasure
the ﬂowers had always given me, and how much I
missed them (all this, of course, was unknown to Mr.
L He promised to resume sending them and
that same night two of the plates bore exceptional
ﬂoral greetings. In one (Fig. 2144) a messenger dove
carries a waratah' in its beak, instead of the traditional
olive leaf. On the other (No. 2145) for the ﬁrst time
there is writing on the vase holding the ﬂowering plant
viz., the words "All Love" together with the signature
M.D., the latter in response to my special request, as
for some time he had discontinued his practice of
signing the ﬂower pictures.
"
[An Australian national ﬂower. Mrs. Donohoe comes

Mr. Warrick, to whom I send a print of each skotograph as I receive it, and who has
therefore a collection as complete as my own, can testify to these facts which I am glad to
put on record through him, as they serve to disprove, once and for all, the ridiculous assertion
that Mr. L——— has consistently deceived me for six years, having faked the very large
number of skotographs which I have given him to develop in that time. He could not
possibly know about my appeal to my husband to resume sending the ﬂowers, nor of his
promise to do so.
Mr. Warrick has reproduced here less than a tithe of the more than 4,300 results my
albums now contain. But even this relatively limited number will, I think, demonstrate
to any impartial investigator how far removed they are from what I, or any photographer I
might employ, could be supposed to invent. The meaning of at least a few is quite outside
my knowledge. The interpretation of some I can only guess at. The great majority have
for me a deﬁnite purpose and message, and what they are I shall try to explain in these notes
which Mr. “"arrick has kindly invited me to contribute to his book.
" Be happy l
" writes my husband in one of his code messages to me.
" We do not
forget you." Indeed it would seem that no anniversary, either public or private, is forgotten
by the loving hearts on the Other Side. During the past few years I have been given appro
priate pictures and messages for each Easter, Armistice Day, Christmas, the New Year and
other public anniversaries, as well as for my own birthday and wedding day, and the
anniversary of my husband's passing.
My group of workers in the Spirit World consists of my husband and four nephews.
They have the occasional and inspiring help of two high spirits—Fletcher, the guide of the
famous American medium, Arthur Ford, and of another whom I know only as
"
X."
With the passing of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ﬁve years ago their work received a fresh
impetus, for he has continued the same kind, helpful interest in my skotographs which he
0
manifested while here. They elected him their leader, and under his guidance many pictures
with explanatory script have come to me in orderly, purposeful sequence, forming now a series
of less than a dozen skotographs, and anon one of some hundreds.
Several of the shorter series reveal how life is lived in that Other World—so curiously
and surprisingly like this one—the people they meet; the glorious scenery; their homes,
gardens and general environment; the recreations in which they indulge. (For examples
of their games and music see p. 343.)
11
Of the longer series the two most remarkable are those I call the Pharaoh Story
"
and the
"
Euripides-Pericles-Phidias Story
"
respectively.
The former was told to Conan Doyle and my husband byGolden Cloud, 2. Red Indian chief
who in his younger days had been a Pharaoh. It took them seven months and one hundred
and forty skotographs of script and illustrations to ’transmit to me this vivid narrative of
a kingship enjoyed and lost some four thousand years ago (see p. 341).
I may mention that several students of Egyptology to whom I have submitted it—
amongst them the well-known Mr. Howard Hulme-—recognise its credibility as a present
ment of a fragment of Egyptian history.
The Euripides story, which began in June of last year and has already occupied over
nine hundred plates in the telling, is still going on. It is full of fascinating sidelights on the
Golden Age of Greece, and records of that great time many behind-the-scene incidents which
are either unknown to history, or are in apparent contradiction to it. (See pp. 345 )
Mrs. M. DONOHOE LOQ. Pars.(352) to(35 ) Figs. 0/407, D/410Page333
Figs. D r39, 140 and 385 on page 335 are all Armistice Day pictures, in each case
impressed on a plate held by me while listening to a service either wirelessed or otherwise,
and given in response to my special request.
In 1929, while listening-in to the Armistice Day Service, I held a plate which, on develop
ment, showed in the centre a soldier's head and round it, in ever-widening circles,
innumerable dots possibly intended to represent the heads of other soldiers. D113() came
on a plate held in similar fashion on the morning of Armistice Day, 1930, and D0 140 on one
held during the evening Commemoration Service of that date (see page 335).
(352) D0385 has an especially interesting story connected with it. It came on a plate which
I held during the Albert Hall Commemoration Service on the Sunday preceding Armistice
Day, 1931, Nov. 8th. The day before, Nov. 7th, I had a sitting with the Reﬂectograph
mediums, Mrs. Singleton and .\Ir. Kirkby. Miss Felicia Scatcherd, whom I had known in
earth life, communicated, and enjoined upon me to take a plate to the service on the following
day, saying that the Spirit Photographers were preparing something good both for
Mrs. Deane and myself. This injunction I obeyed. During the service Mr. Craze, the
President. told the audience that .\Irs. Estelle Roberts, the clairvoyante, had just described
to him a vision she was seeing of a cross of spiritual light suspended in the air in the centre
of the auditorium, above which rose a beautiful seven-rayed star. As will be seen, my
plate when developed showed both of these, with a gigantic black cenotaph on the right
hand side. At its foot is a crowd of Lilliputian people, one of whom is pointing upward to
the cross and star (see page 335).
(353) Each Easter has had its special pictures. In 1929 the Sun with rays reaching to
the
farthest limits of the plate was given. Fig. D/53, page 335, which I call
"
The Arisen Soul
came on Easter Sunday, 1930, and D/52 which I have named
" In the Valley of the Shadow
of Death
" a day or two previously. They form the seventh and eighth pictures of a pilgrim
series in which that same graceful woman's form is seen travelling from darkness to light.
Note in D/52 the cyprus trees on either side and the River of Death beneath. Both
"1
0/52 and D53 the pilgrim is holding aloft the swastika, emblem of eternal life. For Easfcr
of 1931 I was given an egg surrounded by ﬂowers, and the following year also an egg. “ 1th
it came a message from my husband wishing me a happy Easter.
Fig. D1407 Fig. 0/410
(354) livery Christmas has had its special pictures of which D1407 and l)/4ro above
will serve as examples. The hanging mistletoe and holly show that our Earth customs are
not forgotten in the Etheric World: the string of bell-shaped ﬂowers is an Australian
touch,they being much used for Christmas decoration in our Southern Land. "For Christmas"
was spelt out to me by my husband when D/406 and an accompanying message were being
impressed. When the plates were developed, 1 found that the message read:
" You will
be pleased to know we have Dr.
_l.
with us." Dr.
J.
was a friend with whose family my
husband and l—and, after his passing,
I
alone—-had always spent Christmas, and he had
died in the preceding August. I)/4o() (page 337) shows my husband welcoming Dr.

on the
Other Side. Above their heads shines an eight-raved star (Note—The stars in my pictures
are almost invariably eiglit-rayed, that of D1385 being an exception, namely seven-rayed,
thus tallying with Mrs. Roberts' clairvoyant vision).
[In a pocketcalendar sent me from Australia
I
ﬁnd an illustration of this ﬂower-Christmas
bell with the following remarks: "It ﬂowers practically at Christmas time, hence its name

(355) D/4 and D/5. I had asked
my Spirit friends whether it was
necessary for me to hold the plate
between my hands, suggesting that
they perhaps could make an impress
ion on it when simply placed on the
couch beside me. They told me no,
that I must hold it, and that week,
possibly by way of emphasising their
instructions, they impressed (on two
different plates) hands, one showing
the thumb but no little ﬁnger, and
the other showing no thumb. That
is how my hands look when I am
holding a. plate, as the little ﬁnger oi
one is hidden by the plate round
which it is curved, and similarly the 0

given me to emphasise something that has been said by my spirit
visitors, One night during the little preliminary conversation
we nearly always have before the actual work of impressing the
plates begins, I bemoaned my diminished income and said how
agreeable it would be if they could suggest some way of augment
ing it. " Wealth can be a. disaster
" was spelt out in response,
and when the plate I was holding at the time was developed, I
was amused to ﬁnd the head of King Midas on it, the asses' ears
serving to identify him.

[Note that the ﬂowers in this picture are all alike but of different sizes as if made by the
same projector from different distances. This identity of details is found in many such
skotos, see Figs. D/323, D1135 (p. 339); Fig. D1260 below, Figs. D/615, D/Gio (p. 337). The
same thing applies to butterﬂies or moths when several appear on one plate. See D/525,
D/262. An Egyptian scene received by me in the following circumstances :—The late
Mr. Alain Ratﬁn, the healing medium, after seeing some of my skotographs, wrote to me
saying that his Egyptian guide had instructed him to send me a letter. This letter I was to
hold folded round a. photographic plate and an Egyptian scene would then be put upon the
plate. The interpretation of the picture as given by a gentleman versed in Egyptology is,
" Isis, the Divine Mother, wife of Osiris, the God of Resurrectiomis standing on the steps
of her temple, the Bull of Amon behind
her. Thoth, the Divine Intelligence, is
in the form of an Ibis, his emblem;
Seb, the God of Earth. is in his
emblematic form of a goose." (In this
connection see D/25, page 334.)
[D/2oo. The ﬂowers (?) in this

observation already made concerning

appear to be identical. suggesting in each case the use of one and the same projector. In
D/615 they all have eight dots in the lower row and four dots in the upper row, and it is to be
noticed that in the left.hand side at the bottom there are streaks of light ; in the lower row
these streaks are eight in number and more or less in the same curve as the lower dots in
the blossoms, showing that in one case the projector, whatever it was, moved, and instead of
leaving an impression of the ﬂower left the streaks.

is 73, typiﬁed possibly by the seven ridges of the three shells. Not the same but a similar
skotograph came a few weeks later.
D/3r6. [Showing curious movements of two eight spots of light? F.W.W.]
(364) D/255 and D/253 belong to a series of seven skotographs which, as I believe, were
designed and sent by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in response to my request for special evidence
for Mr. F. W. Warrick, who at this time paid me several visitso to view my albums of
skotographs and to develop some of my plates. First came a CD. message :
“ Our touch
with the world is very limited. Carry on !
" Then D/255:
" Am in centre of three vast
circles. If openings in line, we transmit," and D/253, showing the "three vast circles" with
their openings. Note the C. D. in dots (3 for C : 4 for D) in the centre.
I'[The author’s store of mental images came thereby possibly within range of Mrs. Donohoe's
telepathic power to be used subconsciously. F.W.W.]
This picture had no meaning for me, but when Mr. Warrick saw it, he recognised it as
being designed on a principle similar to the combination lock of his safe which is operated by
numbers. The four pictures which came subsequently are on page 340, Figs. D/360, 505,
503 and 520. Side by side with D/360 Mr. Warrick has put a photograph of the exterior of
his American safe lock. Next came D/5o3 showing the
"
openings in line
"
with the
bolt passed through the openings, and then, the most remarkable of all, D/5o5—the lock in
working order placed inside a triangle with rounded corners. Now Mr. VVarrick, as a young
man, had adopted for the ﬁrm of manufacturing chemists of which he is the head, a design
which consists of a triangle with rounded corners, and registered it at H..\0I. Patent
Ofﬁce. (See inset, D/505.) In D/52o the lock appears to be once more given, this time
having in its centre the spirit ﬂower which constantly comes into my skotographs. Moreover,
I later came across a note I had made of a communication from my husband given about
the time that I had begun receiving the series. It read: "C.D. message A. Lock." This
had been spelt out to me by jerks of the photographic slide I was holding (my husband's
method of communicating) and I took it to mean that I was to meet a Mr. A. Lock and
give him a greeting from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In the light of later developments the
message has taken on a very ditferent meaning.
[The inset D/505 is not quite correct—there should be no W.B. inside the triangle—the
plain triangle was the design registered. F.W.W.]
D/399. This was accompanied by a Cl). message : "We meet many old friends and we
tell them of you."
C.D. messages always came in black dots on a white background when printed. M.D.
messages always in white dots on a black background.

In Shadow Land (p. 345)
Mme. D'Espérance, one of the

when not in trance, she felt
all the kisses and embraces
bestowed by a sitter on a ghost
form and only bygrasping the
hand of a sitter could she
assure herself she was really
sitting on her chair.
Prof. Th. Flournoy writes in
his classic book Des Indes a la
Planéte 1Wars :
Meeting or seeing one's
double when awake is not a
very rare occurrence with
mediums. It happened to
Hélene Smith in a séance
when she was not entranced
and was conversing freely
with the sitters, to see two
copies of herself some yards
in front of her so that, as she
expressed it and described it
very well at the time, there
were in all three Misses Hélene
Smith in the room.

(366) Lacey-Rita Skotographs.
L.R./1 L.R./2
During the years 1896 to 1904 (as far as I can learn) Mr. Charles Lacey, a
retired business man, sat very frequently for psychic photography with Mr. Rita,
who is mentioned by Campbell Holms in his Facts of Psychic Science as
“
a powerful and well-tried medium."
Mr. Henry Blackwell, who was so well known for his great interest in, and
knowledge of, psychic photography, wrote me:—
"
Following some original experiments carried out by Mr. A. Glendinning
with Mr. David Duguid in 1893, Messrs. Lacey and Rita tried sitting without
the use of a camera. They held an unopened packet of plates between their
hands for several minutes or longer if so desired by the
“
guides
"
and then
they were usually told which plate or plates had been affected. Upon
development this would be found to be correct and the remainder of the
packet would be blank. In this way Mr. Lacey obtained some hundreds of
exceedingly interesting negatives which he made use of by lecturing on the
subject with suitable lantern slides.
The supernormal origin of these skotographs is supported by the character
of Mr. Lacey, who expended a deal of time and money on his experiments,
which were carried out with the utmost care."
Concerning Mr. Lacey, Mr. Coates wrote in Photographing the Invisible, p.289, that "
his
reputation was of the best. He has a special gift or mediumship for these psychic pro
ductions."
After the passing on of Mr. Lacey, Mr. Blackwell purchased all of his photographic
negatives. Subsequently he presented a number of them to the author, who is glad to be able
to reproduce some examples of them, for they have a character of their own—I have not
seen any similar photographs—the background is generally most bizarre, and reminds
one forcibly of polished black marble. I have noticed the following interesting
points, viz., that the groundwork is partly the same in a group of three of the photographs
(two only illustrated) (Figs. L.R./9 and 10), the
0
Extra '
faces being different; the back
grounds of Figs. L.R./XI and 12 are also alike. In two others the
'
Extra '
faces are alike,
the backgrounds different.
In Coates' book (pp. 289-295) a detailed and carefully particnlarised account is given
of a. recognised Extra which appeared on a Lacey-Rita skotograph; a most curious and
interesting case.
(367) In an account of the Lacey-Rita photographic experiments in Borderland, 1896,
Vol. III, pp. 444 et seq., Mr. W. T. Stead says:
“
An investigator [Mr. Lacey] has from time
to time reported to me the results of his experiments." This gentleman wrote that he
purchased and brought unopened to a darkened séance room a box of a dozen Ilford ordinary
quarter-plates. There he opened the box. Ilford plates are done up in packets of four.
He took one packet, placed it unopened in another quarter-plate box. This box he closed,
and put it on the hand of his friend [Rita], covering it with his own. There he allowed it to
Page 348 LACEY-RITA
L.R./3. L.R./4.
remain for about one minute. He then took the box into his own hands, and held it there
for a few minutes. Then, without ever allowing the box to pass from his possession, he
opened the box, unfolded the paper, and developed the plates in the ordinary way. Until
the plates were placed in the developing tray they never left his hand. On the top and
bottom plate were indistinct and shadowy forms. The two middle plates are represented
by the above ﬁgures (Figs. L.R.3, L.R.4). Every plate was diﬂ'erently impressed, and
that without being exposed.
The second set of plates which he sent was obtained at a later sitting and treated in the
same way. All the plates had pictures, but some were positives and others negatives.
Mr. Stead's correspondent is emphatic that no one touched the plates but himself, from v
the time he bought them till he developed them. He said he had obtained quite as good
results in a room brilliantly lighted by gas.
In La Photographic Transcendanlale a few pages are devoted to Mr. Lacey. From
this article it appears that he obtained [by himself before he employed Rita] skotographs
containing faces by holding a single plate between his hands. He was clairaudient and used
to hear a voice murmur
"
It's done "; he then developed the plates. With his assistant
[Rita] he worked for seven years for skotographs. I quote from the work cited.
The writer of the account in that book stated that he was indebted for all particulars
to Prof. Caccia, who was constantly in contact with Mr. Lacey and saw him at work. Prof.
Caccia stated that :
" One day his (Lacey's) invisible guide counselled him to treat a whole
packet of plates. Mr. Lacey bought a packet of a dozen. Without opening it he placed it
between his own hands and those of his secretary [Rita] as usual. The top plate and that at
the bottom, as Mr. Lacey was informed clairaudiently, remained blank ; on the other hand,
all the other plates had each a separate picture."
I continue to quote from the above book wherein the Extra mentioned below is repro
duced.
Mr. Lacey, as sitter, was at times transparent or partly transparent, and sometimes
neither Mr. Lacey nor his seat appeared, but they were replaced by an apparition of some kind.
"In this strange way they obtained the photograph of a young Chilian girl. A Chilian
gentleman came to London and was introduced by a friend to Mr. Lacey who consented to
try the experiment of obtaining a special Extra. The Chilian brought a box of plates ; one
of these, duly marked, was placed in the camera and exposed upon Mr. Lacey. The plate
was immediately developed. The plate, on which one sees the identiﬁcation mark, bore no
trace of Mr. Lacey or the settee, but the phantasmal picture of a young girl with a shawl,
whom the Chilian recognised without a doubt as a young servant of his home who had died a
LAC EY-RITA Page 3 49
L.R./7 L.R./8
year before. He declared that no doubt was possible; that the resemblance was extra
ordinary and added that this domestic had never been photographed during life. He left
a declaration to the truth of above narrative."
Note.—In September, 1878, Rita, as a materialising medium. was exposed with Charles
Williams on the Continent (I quote from Dr. Fodor's Encyclopaedia). A bottle of phosphor
ised oil. several yards of very dirty and creased white muslin, a false black beard and other
paraphernalia were found hidden on their persons. The British National Association of
Spiritualists investigated the exposure and found the charges proved. Rita had never put
in a denial and Lacey, whose experiments with Rita took place eighteen years later, must
have known of this scandal and presumably would have been very cautious in his dealings
with Rita: that he was in the habit of exercising great caution is shown by his letter to
Borderland from which I have quoted.

(368) The Goligher Circle.
On page 27 of this book I mention photographs obtained at a Goligher sitting showing
material which has been called ectoplasm.
The phenomena of the Goligher Circle are well known through the published works
of Dr. W. ]. Crawford, of Belfast.o
The author of this book was appointed by Dr. Crawford his literary executor and takes
this opportunity of calling attention to the above photographs and others obtained at the same
Circle since Dr. Crawford's death.
Those who are interested in the subject may like to know that there is an album (R205)
in the library of the S.P.R. containing 198 photographs (inclusive of reproductions and
enlargements) taken at Belfast with the Goligher Circle in 1920-1921 by Dr. Crawford and
others. Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing had a duplicate set; they are discussed in a collection
of his essays entitled Gcsammelte Aufsaet2e 2ur Purapsychologic. These photographs are very
curious, some of them very suggestive of (apported?) woven material; in one one the ends
of the white matter are apparently tied round the legs of the table. See Fig. L in Psychic
Structures at the Goligher Circle by Dr. Crawford (John M. Watkins, London).
To the favourable testimony contained in the Appendix to Dr. Fournier d'Albe's book
mentioned below, I would add the assurance given me by Mrs. Crawford, who naturally
saw a great deal of Miss Kate Goligher (as she then was), a girl still in her teens, that she
would not and did not practise any conscious deception. In the said Appendix Mr. David (low
late editor of Light wrote:
" If I had had any doubts of the bona ﬁdes of the medium and
those most closely associated with her, these would have been speedily set at rest by the
independent testimony I received, some of it by persons eminently qualiﬁed as observers.
I may mention, for instance, Sir \Nilliam Barrett, who was thoroughly satiﬁed. There was
also Mr. Whately Smith, a member of the Council of the S.P.R., of which Sir William Barrett
is Vice-President. That there were many other witnesses of good standing is equally known
to those who have made any study of the matter."
In September, 1920, the author arranged for Mr. Stephenson (whose experiments with
.\lr. Hope, of Crewe, are described in chapter V) to conduct a. test-sitting with the Goligher
Circle; a full account of it is to be found in the Psychic Research Quarterly, Vol. I, No. 2,
October, 1920. Actual photographic prints of some of the negatives obtained are included
in The Goligher Circle, by E. E. Fournier d'Albe, D.Sc., Lond. and Birm., published by John
Watkins, London.
One of these photographs is reproduced
here, Fig. G/ 1 chosen because it was taken by
ﬂash-light while the room was illuminated by
red light Mr. Stephenson was standing close
to the medium's chair, looking down upon
her; any movement by her could not have
escaped his notice, nor that of the other com
petent sitters, two of them doctors of medicine
and one a professional photographer. Miss
Goligher had been thoroughly searched by
the two lady doctors before the sitting.
Since the above sitting was held no tests
have been made with Miss Goligher until
1933. In the meantime she had married and is
averse to sitting for psychic experiments.
She has two children. In May, 1933, at the
request of her husband, Mr. Donaldson, she
gave a few sittings for infra-red photographs.
An account of these sittings and repro
ductions of the photographs obtained are
printed in Psychic Science, july, i933.
Mr. Stephenson and the author were present _
at one of these sittings. Flll- G/I-

In April, 1935, another sitting was held and a photograph obtained by infra-red light
It shows a mass of something round about the medium's right foot, but the photograph is
not contrasty enough for reproduction here.
In October, 1935, a further sitting was held at Belfast with .\lrs . Donaldson
(Kate Goligher) at which Mr. Donaldson (Kate Goligher's husband) obtained photographs
also by means of infra-red rays. At this sitting a special contrivancc was made use of to
render the conditions even more strict than before. A framework of large mesh wire netting
was constructed with an aperture large enough to take Mrs. Donaldson's feet. This cage
measures 2 feet wide by 2 feet high by 5 feet long, and the hole for the feet is about 15 ins.
wide by 12 ins. high ; part of the covering near the medium is of three-ply wood instead of

wire-netting. Mr. Stephenson attended this sitting and testiﬁes that any movement by
K.G. or of the wire cage would not have escaped his ears. He sat quite close to her. See
Psychic Science, January, 1936.
Two exposures were made which yielded the result shown here (Fig. (0r/2 cf. Fig. X in
Dr. Crawford's Psychic Structures) and another of an emanation of a very different character,
more like ﬁne woven material. This latter does not show out from the background
sufficiently for reproduction herein. About four minutes elapsed between the taking of the
two photographs. Instructions for the taking of the photographs were given by three
knocks by the 'control' after permission had been asked whether the photographs could be
taken. The medium was not in trance.

At this sitting were present Ur. S. G. Donaldson, his wife (known as Kate Goligher),
her father and myself (F. McC. 8.). Mr. Donaldson was operating the infra-red ray lamp
which was

feet from the medium. Mr. Goligher was sitting close to him.
I
had asked Mr. Donaldson whether he could suggest any means of rendering the sitting
the most evidential we had ever had. He had suggested
I
should hold the medium's elbows
while two photographs were taken. Mrs. Donaldson knew nothing about this until we
were in the room. We then asked the

guides
'
to show some emanation in the ﬁrst photo
graph and withdraw
it
before a second one was taken. The
'
guides
'
signiﬁed their consent
by three raps.
As on the previous occasions the room was dark before the photograph was taken.
While the light was on
I
took hold of Mrs. Donaldson's elbows and satisﬁed myself that there
was nothing then on the ﬂoor round her feet. From that time
I
did not relax hold of her
elbows until the light was turned on after the second photograph was taken. The second
exposure was taken as quickly after the ﬁrst as one slide could be replaced by a fresh one.
Mr. Donaldson
is
instructed by the
0
control' when to take the photograph, which
information
is
given by raps. Then Mr. Donaldson says: "I will count ten and then
expose." The exposure given was about ten seconds.

“hen the ectoplasmic (?) material was withdrawn into the body the medium's body
was subjected to a kind of spasm (this is usual) which I, holding the medium's elbows, felt
most distinctly. It will be noticed in Fig. G/4 a wisp of hair has been shaken down from off
the forehead and the hands are tightly clenched, whereas in Fig. G/3 the hair is uurufﬂed and
the hands are quietly folded.
Another interesting feature is a very
thin ectoplasmic cord evidently joining
the ectoplasmic mass on the ﬂoor with
the medium's body. It does not come
out very well in the natural size block
(Fig. G/3) ; I have, therefore, had it
enlarged (>< 5 linear) see Fig. (0i/5. This
cord does not appear in the photograph
represented by Fig. G/4: at this (the
second) exposure the ectoplasm had
disappeared.
If in psychic investigation the
standing of the medium and her social
environment, such as her husband's
comfortable home and ample means and
lack of desire for publicity. count for
anything, then I, being on intimate terms
with the family, having known Mrs. D.
for over sixteen years and Mr. D. since
their marriage ten years ago, should not
ask for test conditions.
For others test conditions are
required and those detailed above should
satisfy the most exacting critic for, surely.
no one can suggest that I could have
failed under the conditions to become
cognisant of the movements required of
the medium to place material on the ﬂoor
and withdraw it as shown by the photo

Mr. F. McC. Stephenson 's account ofa Goligher sitting of the
13th October, I936.
Present: Mr. and Mrs. Donaldson (Kate Goligher) and myself (F. McC. Stephenson).
The sitting commenced about 9 p.m. 1
.\‘Ir. Donaldson had placed his infra-red apparatus and the camera in position loaded with
fresh infra-red plates which he had obtained a few days previously from the Ilford Company.
The medium kindly consented to use a cardboard device which I had brought with me.
This appears to me to afford water-tight evidence that the medium could not make use of
her hands during the sitting. Before the lights were put out I secured the medium's hands
in the cardboard, a bicellular handshoe, by means of a piece of string encircling each wrist
one and a half times, called by sailors a
0
round-turn.' (The drawing, Fig. G/B shows the
relative positions of the wrists, cardboard and string.) I tied the string by knots underneath
the cardboard, drawing it quite tight; when I released Mrs. Donaldson's hands there
were red marks on her wrists. I placed my seat close to Mrs. Donaldson,
and looking carefully assured myself that there
was nothing at all on or near the cloth under and
in front of Mrs. Donaldson's shoes. The cloth
was black velvet with the wrong (dull) side of it
uppermost; it was pinned down to the ﬂoor in
my presence. Mr. Donaldson then took his place
behind the infra-red apparatus and extinguished
the lights. Although I could not see anything
I could not fail to hear any movement as my
sense of hearing is acute. We sat talking for
about ﬁfteen minutes when raps were heard
denoting the presence of the 0operators'.
\Ve asked the 0control' for permission to take
a photograph ; after it was taken we asked
5t c1- ,ON permission to take a second one ; permission was
Fis- G/8 given after a pause of about ﬁve minutes.
The ﬁrst exposure produced the result seen in Fig. (0r/6.
The result of the second exposure (Fig. G17) shows nothing abnormal. (In this
illustration half of my face has been covered, as the infra-red rays gave me such an unshaven
appearance.) The material on the ﬂoor, the cloud on my forehead of the ﬁrst picture and
the phantom cigarette (I say phantom for I had nothing normal in my mouth when the
ﬁrst photograph was taken) between my lips had all disappeared and the picture above me
on the wall was now unobscured.
It will be noticed that the cloud on and about my forehead has obscured somewhat a
Page 356 Pars. (369) (370) THE GOLIGI-IER CIRCLE

portion of the picture on the wall above me. It has been observed that my presence at
these sittings is a good inﬂuence ; maybe this cloud is due to some psychic element in myself.
During the few seconds the electric light was on for the exposures I looked down at
the medium's feet and noticed when the ﬁrst photograph was taken that her feet were
enveloped in a mist. I could see both feet and legs, but as through a fog. During the
second exposure I could see no such mist.
It was absolutely impossible for Mrs. Donaldson to withdraw her hands from the
I
covering. I brought the cardboard apparatus with me to the sitting and Mrs. Donaldson had
not seen it before. After the séance I found that the string was round her wrists and securely
knotted as I had ﬁxed it.
We closed the sitting soon after the second exposure.
(369) A test silling with Mrs. Helen Duncan in l 932.
For the account of this sitting and the photograph used for the illustration I am
indebted to Mr. S. (I. Donaldson of Belfast.
— r¢ When Mrs. Duncan was on a visit to Belfast in
1932 Mr. Donaldson engaged her to sit one evening
for himself and a few of his friends ; although he had
sat some dozen times at circles where she was the
medium he was desirous of being in a position to
control all the conditions and to obtain an infra-red ray
photograph of any phenomena which were to be seen.
There were present Mr. Donaldson, Mr. Smyth
(a personal friend of Mr. D.), a Belfast lady well
known to Mr. D., a hospital nurse engaged for the
evening by Mr. D., a professional photographer and
his assistant.
0:
The medium was stripped by the nurse and
reclothed by her in a black overall and pair of black
knickers. The medium was examined by the nurse
before and after the sitting.
Mr. Donaldson placed his camera and infra-red
apparatus in position and obtained the photograph
represented by Fig. 456. He is convinced that it
was imposisble for Mrs. Duncan to produce fraudu
lently what he saw. In addition to the bulky nature
of the ectoplasm (?) there is the fact that it disappeared
in ten seconds.
At most of the other sittings attended by
Mr. Donaldson, the medium was also examined and
reclothed and yet voluminous material has been
seen; on one occasion Mr. Donaldson handled it quite
extensively ; to him it felt just like linen, sometimes
. 0. . it was yards in length and the medium trailed it along
Fig. 456 the passage ﬂoor at the side of the sitters. It was in
his opinion quite impossible for Mrs. Duncan to have brought into the cabinet such a mass
of material. (370) Comment Is this a case of apportage ?
TRICKERY. Pars. (371) (372) Page 357
(371) Comment—As happens with most mediums for physical effects Mrs. Duncan has
been accused of cheating. Mr. Harry Price in his book Leaves from a Psychist's Case Book
gave many photographs of cheesecloth and other material objects which appeared, no one
knows how, at sittings with her. On one occasion at least Mr. Price assures us that the
conditions (examination of and special apparel for the medium, etc., etc.) were such that
normal cheating was out of the question ; he assumed the medium had extraordinary power
of swallowing and regurgitating-an assumption only. No medium has yet been found
accomplishing such swallowing and regurgitating, and against such a theory being the correct
one in the case of Mrs. Duncan we have the report of Dr. Margaret Vivian of Bournemouth
published in Light of January 1st, 1932, that, after pastilles of methylene blue sufficient to
dye the contents of the stomach were swallowed by Mrs. Duncan at sittings conducted under
strict test conditions, the material which appeared was invariably snow-white. Dr. Vivian
says that at some of these Bournemouth sittings material equivalent to at least a dozen yards
of cheesecloth appeared. The theory of apportage might cover the appearance of the
material objects but hardly that of forms which spoke.
To Dr. Vivian's report the signatures of other sitters are appended. Indeed, in Light
and elsewhere a number of favourable reports on Duncan sittings is to be found. See
especially the article by Mr. Frank T. Blake (published in Light of the 22nd of january, 1932)
whom the Editor of that journal described as one of the most experienced investigators in
the country. Mr. Blake wrote
"
one thing I know: that she is the most valuable medium
for physical phenomena in the British Isles, and that her phenomena, as witnessed at
Bournemouth, are not only above suspicion but incapable of production by fraudulent means."
(372) Concerning Trickery on the part of mediums.
I have not shirked recording any apparent trickery which I have come across during
my investigations, mixed with phenomena which I know to be genuine. I ﬁnd that other
investigators in the same domain report that with most mediums for physical effects
such admixture is found. I quote below the views of some of the best authorities on this
subject. No doubt one day a psychological (distinct from a moral) cause of this admixture
will be discovered.
I would refer the reader to sections Nos. 39 to 41 in Holm's The Fads of Psychic Science
and Philosophy and to Dr. Nandor Fodor's Encyclopedia of Psychic S11.e1!“ for articles on the
question of fraud in mediumship.
No one is more competent to express an opinion on the question of trickery on the part
of mediums than Dr. HEREWARD CARRINGTON in view of his sceptical bias, his knowledge
and practice of conjuring, his many years of devotion to practical psychical research.
Dr. Carrington with two other members of the S.P.R. had several sittings with Eusapia
Paladino, an account of which is to be found in his work Eusapia Paladino and Her
Phenomena. He writes (p. 244) :-—" Eusapia has been known to defraud her sitters whenever
she could, and all investigators have found that, were she permitted, she would occasionally
release one hand or one foot, and endeavour to produce phenomena with it. To the man
in-the-street it would appear ....... ..to be useless to look for genuine phenomena in the
presence of a. fraudulent medium. In spite of the apparent rationality of this argument,
however, all those investigators who have had much experience with Eusapia, contend
that this argument is not valid in her case and that genuine phenomena do occur in her
presence, if fraud be prevented."
On p. 25r he writes: "My own sittings [with E.P.] convinced me ﬁnally and con
clusively that genuine phenomena do occur."
And on p. 260:
"
Before I had my personal sittings, I had been an extremely severe
critic of the reports of others—I now think, too severe. It is a very different matter—being
convinced of the phenomena oneself and convincing others."
There is an excellent paper in the Annalrs des Sciences Psychiques, Vol. VI, pp. 06 et seq.,
by DR. 1. OCHOROWICZ on the question of fraud. In this he deals with the accusations
of trickery made against Eusapia Paladino. He says
" A medium will always cheat auto
matically even in an awake state, which being a mixed state and not simple can be
interrupted momentarily and intermittently by trance."
FRANK PODMORE in his Modem Spiritualism, Vol. II, pp. 76-77, writes :—" It seems not
unreasonable to conclude, therefore, that mediums have certain common characteristics
and may be to some extent unconscious of their actions and therefore not fully responsible
for them. In modern terminology, the medium, whether 'physical' or 'impressional
'
is
probably a person of unstable nervous equilibrium in whom the control normally exercised
by the higher-brain centres is liable, on slight provocation, to be abrogated, leaving the
organism, as in dream or somnambulism, to the guidance of impulses which in a state of
unimpaired consciousness would have been suppressed before they could have resulted in
action."
A long article by MR. C. C. MASSEY, one of the ablest psychical researchers of his day,
will be found in the Proc. of the S.P.R., Vol. IV, pp. 01-95, from which I take the following
paragraph :—
Page 358 TRICKERY
"The whole theory of mediumship points to inffuences and conditions which must
result sometimes in actual deception, and sometimes in the mere appearance of it. It is a
mistake to suppose that we can make this branch of psychical research quite independent
of psychology. There are features in this trickery which should make us look a little
deeper than the comuring and fraud theory for its explanation."
In the journal of the American S.P.R., Vol. \0., May, roll. Dr. JAMFS H. HYSLOP
writes concerning
" “isc [5." who was discovered playing tricks with the phonograph by
means of a string. He says: >
" She seemed nothing daunted by the discovery, as was always the case in such
situations, and went on with various efforts to perform the result. She tried with perfect
honesty to do the thing without any accessories, but failed.
" The struggle to get the cord off the phonograph and to evade discovery shows some
sort of consciousness or subconsciousness, or, as Dr. Prince would say, co-consciousness
of the situation and of an attempt to deceive. It is hard to resist or question such an
interpretation of the act. It is not necessary to dispute the existence of an attempt to
deceive. But we may raise the question as to who it is that is trying the
'
trickery.' Is it one
of the secondary personalities of 0Miss B' or is it some outside intelligence? I do not
endeavour to decide this ﬁnally. It is the problem."
I-IDIIARD VON HAR0DIANN in his work entitled Spiritism wrote :—" We are reminded of
the provinces of mental and nervous disease, hysteria and somnambulism. where the
physician and the theorist have likewise to deal with the many subtle attempts at deception,
without their scientiﬁc zeal being arrested on that account.
"It is a logical fallacy to infer from the fact that a medium has cheated in one case,
under certain conditions, that he has been always merely cheating under most different
conditions ; the conditions of every case have to be examined and one indubitable instance
cannot be ueutralised by a hundred negative cases."
DR. HANS DRIESCH, Professor of Philosophy at Leipsic, writes in his work Psychical
li’ucarch :
"
It is a fallacy to say that because a medium has cheated once he always cheats."
THEODORE FLOURNOY, Professor of Psychology at the University of Geneva, author
of From India to the Planet Mars, one of the most cautious and conservative scientists
who have interested themselves in psychic phenomena, in his work Esprils et Mediums,
after speaking very frankly, and one might say boldly, in support of Mlle. Tomczyk's
tclekinetic phenomena as observed by Dr. Ochorowicz (which he himself had the opportunity
of witnessing). alludes to Mlle. Tomczyk's desire that he (Flournoy) should witness the
phenomenon of an apport; this she duly produced, but in so naive and trivial a way that
although not a conjurer he detected it at once. Then he writes : "But have we the right to
charge with fraud these farcical performances with which somnambulic personalities of
mediums expect to please us? Is it not as if we accused infants of lying and trying to
deceive us when they tell us of the exploits of a big Indian chief or of the silly doings of
their dolls? I am inclined to believe that these trance personalities see no essential
difference between these telekinetic forces (supernormal to us), which they use as naturally
as we do our muscular forces, and those means of action which they share with us and
which we call normal. Seeing that we interest ourselves in their deeds and are enraptured
with some of them, they amuse themselves at inventing them for us without- distinguishing
between the processes of their fabrication and other phenomena, and they do not compre
hend the distinction between genuine and fraudulent which we introduce between actions
that robably do not differ more among themselves, so far as consciousness is concerned,
than n our own case the act of lifting a grain of powder when giving it a toss or blowing
on it."- (journal of the American S.P.R. Vol. V.)
MR. RENE SUDRE, who is a very critical researcher, author of Introduction ii In
)l'l/lapsychiquc Humaine and other works, wrote in the journal of the American S.P.R., I918,
concerning
iIan
Gnzyk :—" Having attended numbers of his séances, alike in Paris and
in Poland, ﬁnd
it
interesting to go back over his career,
a
career of quite the same
character as those of other great metapsychical subjects, with a light and a dark side, an
element of trickery side by side with one of true supernormal faculty. It
is
too much the
custom, in certain scientiﬁc circles, and most profane ones, to judge these singular beings
as ordinary men are judged, and to demand
a
rigour of conscience that
is
inconsistent with
the |)sycho-pathological conditions of their psychic gift."
If
the operating intelligence producing the Extras
is
a
dissociated stream of consciousness
or secondary personality of the mediums
it
is
understandable, in view of the fact that
secondary personalities are known to be mischievous and unmoral, that use should be made
by photographic mediums of material things such as luminous paint and cut-outs to
accomplish their projects, regardless of the injury to the medium's reputation. The experi
ments of Ochorowicz with Mlle. Tomczyk and her control
" Stasia," the experiments of Enrico
lmoda with Linda (lnzzera, Traill Taylor's experiments with Mr. Duguid, some of Madame
liisson's results with Eva
C
.. and many others reported in this book incline one to that view.
Indeed,
if
it
is
some unknown subconscious faculty of the medium which produces
these phenomena
it
is
likely for such
a
faculty to adopt (unconsciously) the easier normal
means rather than the more diflicult and exhausting supernormaI where the opportunity so
to do
is
given, as did liusapia Paladino, see
p.
357 (372). On the other hand,
if
one subjects
n
medium to stringent conditions one may be including in them obstacles interfering naturally
with the invisible methods his subconsciousness has to employ.

(373) Some rambling readings and thoughts on the origin of some
physical psychic phenomena.
It is a fascinating game to indulge in inventing hypotheses to account for the facts
contained in this book and in literature dealing generally with psychics.
Monsieur CHARLES RICHET, Professor at the Sorbonne and Membrc de l'Institut
de France, in his Parapsychological lecture given before the Medical Faculty of Paris on
the 24th June, 1925, said :—" Right at the beginning let me say with my illustrious Master,
Claude Bernard, when you wish to experiment you must not theorise; you must leave all
your theories with your overcoat in the cloakroom." He added, smiling," When you go
out pick up your theories with your overcoat. I give you this precept: 0Be as courageous
in hypothesis as you are rigorous in experimentation'.
"
In an article on Physics and Philosophy in 1927, Prof. J. B. S. HALDANE is quoted
as hinting that it may be that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer
than we can suppose. (The Observer, Jan. 1st, 1928.)
What is the general conclusion to which my experiments and those of others in this
ﬁeld lead? The presence at these experiments of some invisible intelligent being, able to deal
with matter in some manner nn-understandable by us as regards space and time. The intelligent
entity being either something altogether apart from the medium but using him ; or some
absolutely new apparatus invented by the medium's organism, or maybe a portion itself of
that same organism capable of acting outside his body.
"
It is the duty of every student of psychic (and other) phenomena to stretch to the
furthest limit the so-called natural explanation of them. A natural or scientiﬁc explanation
of the phenomena dealt with herein is however not possible as they are mostly in contra
diction to the laws of natural science as taught today. When we recognise the psychic
side as disparate from the material side of being, as belonging to a special order of things
in which the space-time relations known to us in the material world have no value, then we
have a very broad basis for
0
natural
'
phenomena and research, but the methods of research
and the foundations of knowledge of classical science leave us in the lurch, being too narrow."
I quote the above from a German professor's writing but it requires no a.uthoritative support—
it is self-evident.
The presence of outside intelligent beings is considered by many of those best equipped
by ability, learning and experimentation to deal with the subject, to be the only possible
origin of some psychic phenomena. In the Preface I have quoted a few of these opinions.
There are other authorities who try to account for them by suggesting that all the
phenemona are the work of the medium without any help from outside.
EDUARD von HARTMANN (in his Spirilism; answered by AKSAKOF in his great work
Animisme et Spiritisme by bringing forward a number of psychic phenomena not covered
by Hartmann) tried to explain all the psychic happenings by endowing theoretically the
subconscious with many extraordinary qualities. Dr. G ELEV, before he was associated
with I'Institut Métapsychique wrote a book L'Etre Suhconscimt under the pseudonym
E. Gyel, also putting forward the subconscious mind as being the source of psychic phe
nomena. Dr. SCHRENCK-NOTZING, Professor RICHET and Dr. OSTY, also postulate that the
medium possesses some unknown faculty—some sixth sense or psycho-dynamism—which
enables him to produce all psychic effects.
Mr. Leslie Curnow, author of The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism, considered there
was much good evidence which pointed unmistakenly to the action of the
'
Double' as a
possible explanation of some at least of the mysterious phenomena of the Davenport brothers,
and that the same might be said of other physical mediums.
Dr. George Wyld, one of the pioneers of the early days, held the view that the phenomena
were largely due to the action of spirits incarnate.
Stainton Moses, recognising indeed the potency of the human spirit, considered
Dr. Wyld predicated of it while yet incarnated something very like omniscience, omnipotence
and omnipresence. See
'
Spirits in the Flesh
'
Psychic Science, Vol. V. p. 283.
If we adopt the theory that many psychic phenomena are produced by the action of
outside intelligent beings upon mediums we must remember, in order to account for the
rarity of the phenomena, that human beings have lived alongside ants and bees for very
many years yet have not communicated with them. \Vhen a human being does succeed in
obtaining control of the organism of an ant here and there he will probably play the fool
with them and give them and their fellows the same surprises as it is conceivable an outside
intelligence is causing us through our mediums.
If we adopt the other view it is dilticult to conceive that a medium can have within
himself powers to produce all the mysterious phenomena recorded herein and elsewhere.
How can we gain an idea by means of analogical reasoning enabling us to see, however
dimly, the possibility of it ? Where can we see anything in nature at all analogous ? In this
task we are helped particularly by the present day view of the nature of life-forms, including
man, being comparable in organisation to that of modern commonwcalths, wherein we see
the effect of discovery and invention rendering members of an advanced state or common
wealth capable of things inconceivable by members of primitive peoples.

of which is in a sense a vital unit, which seems to have a life of its own, relatively independent
of that of the rest of the body. Embryology has shown that this aggregation of cells is
formed by the repeated division of a single parent-cell, the germ-cell, and the cohesion of
the many cells thus formed. Now, the principle of continuity and the analogy presented by
the unicellular animals, each of which divides repeatedly into two or more cells that lead
independent lives, seem to compel us to suppose that the germ.cell has not only life but
also mind, that it enjoys psychical life in however lowly a manner or degree, and that, on
the division of the germ-cell, each of the cells derived from it has also its psychical capacities.
This line of thought leads us inevitably to the view that the developed human being is, as it
were, a vast colony of cells of more or less highly-specialised functions."
HAECKEL again (Riddle of the Universe) in speaking of the dynamic force governing
the cell, calls it the "tissue soul
"
and says :
“
This tissue soul is the higher psychological
function which gives physiological individuality to the compound multicellular organism, as
a true cell commonwealth-it controls all the separate
0
cell souls
'
of the social cells—the
mutually dependent
'
Citizens which constitute the community'."
“
The distinction between the conscious and the sub-conscious mind is a little suggestive
of the distinction between the managing director of a railway and a trained railway operative,
where the director gives the orders but cannot himself do the work. The conscious mind is
the director, but it is the subconscious mind which performs the task." Light, May 27th,
1932. Rays and Reﬂections (David Gow).
One might liken the conscious or objective mind to parliament and the subconscious
or subjective mind to the permanent ofﬁcials where the state is so organised and specialised
that all the organising intelligence is monopolised by the permanent officials, the tissue souls
of Haeckel.
One sees everything going on in the living organism exactly as would happen if it were
an organised human community, a community which has, in its ancestors, followed up to
a point the same routine times without number as if it were furnished with volumes of
instructions (in the chromosomes) for its development at the various stages of its growth
(one might compare conception to the foundation of a human colony effected by placing a
married couple .upon an island isolated from all other land, each supplied with various
volumes of instructions appropriate to various stages of increases of the population, which
mixture of volumes would account for the otfspring partaking of qualities of both parents).
Such instructions would free the progeny from the necessity of probing about for the best
way to evolve and enable it to avoid getting blocked in many a blind alley, as are the macro
organisms, the unfortunate nations of larger growth, of which we are the units. One
remembers that there is no such thing as a standard of size. He remembers the pithy
saying that if the whole universe were reduced to the size of a cricket ball and the various
forms of energy in the same proportion, no one would perceive the difference. He knows
how limited is the power of the microscope compared with that of the telescope, and hopes
that, just as the spectroscope came to the aid of the telescope so some new instrument
may come to the aid of the microscope to reveal something behind the material objects of
the lens. He asks himself whether the physiologist when dealing with his sections, is not
to be likened to some scientist of a distant star viewing our London with an instrument
of limited power, who should conclude that the trains and trams run of themselves and
the umbrellas (if he could see them) open of themselves when it rains ; or describing one of
the Inns of Court should mention only the buildings, quite oblivious of the existence of the
human beings inhabiting them and even more so of the parchments in the safes and cellars
with their all-important writings, embodying contracts, agreements and conditions, carrying
more weight and value probably than all the bricks and mortar and material substances
of which the town is made. Does not every particle of food assimilated by living things
take up its position in the body subject to the existing contracts or pre-existing conditions,
replacing a discharged fragment on the same terms as its predecessor submitted to?
There may be contracts not put into writing; such as the conventions of society,
the unwritten laws—our scientists of the distant star could maybe never discover these and
only by analogy presume their existence.
Among the things invisible to any miscroscope is the wonderful faculty of invention.
Is not one reminded all the time of the inventor's great role in the progress of human
society? Invention is probably as important in the communities constituting life-forms.
Page 362 THEORISINGS
Someone wrote the following doggerel lines embodying the view of the possible importance
of invention in evolution :—
Charles Darwin offered us a key to help unlock the mystery
Of evolution's wondrous span from protoplasm up to man.
If to prophesy he's free, someone may ﬁnd another key
In Invention's magic aid. All progress by invention's made
In mankind's complexity. If each life-form a nation be,
Its ectoscopic populace by similar means may change its race.
Invention is the chief originator of the various advances made by mankind in his social
evolution; so has invention been the originator of evolution of all life-forms—the ecto
scopolitans (Edison's 0little people') of plants have used invention greatly in the ﬁeld of
chemistry, those of animals greatly in the ﬁeld of physics and those of man additionally in
the ﬁeld of psychics, enabling him by the inventions of his ectoscopolitans to obtain contact
with various unsuspected psychic forces and spiritual values, placing him so far in advance
of other animals.
The ectoscopolitans (the out-of-sight citizens of the body) have invented the eye, the
car, a delivery system in the arteries and a telegraph system in the nerves, to mention one or
two of the bodily instruments and functions, all of which the communities of larger growth
are unconsciously imitating or rather re-inventing on their large scale. Man invented
lenses and a camera obscum only to ﬁnd that the ectoscopolitans of his body had done the same
long ago. The development of communities and that of life-forms appear to run on parallel
lines and the study of either may assist the study of the other. Maybe the ectoscopolitans
of some of our fellow men (sensitives) have invented apparatus the equivalents in their
organisms of the mundane apparatus used to produce
“
Movies," "
Talkies
" and even
anticipated man's future invention of
"
Ghosties
" or three-dimensional
“
Movies."
As regards
"
Ghosties
" I would give an instance. At a sitting with the materialising
medium Craddock at which I was present with, among others, my friend Dr. L. B., a medical
lady; this lady felt her dachshund, recently deceased, trying to climb on to her lap as was
his constant habit in life. According to the
"
Ghosties
"
hypothesis this was the repro
duction by the medium through his Ghosties producing apparatus of a three-dimensional
thought-form which he obtained from Dr. L. B.’s mnemoplastic library.
Dr. CARL DU PREL wrote in Die Magic als Naturwissenschajt .0
"
Kapp has shown very
clearly in his book Philosophie der Technik that many human inventions are identical with
organs of the body or parts of the same, for instance, the camera obscum is similar to the
dark chamber of the eye. The Atlantic cable with its insulating covering resembles the
human nerve most astonishingly; both have a similar section."
"In time, every human function, mechanical, physiological and psychic will, he thinks,
be reproduced in our laboratories.
"
It is to the men of science who at present doubt all psychic phenomena we must
look for future discoveries and inventions which will remove all doubt, for they will in
time reproduce the psychic (occult) phenomena in their laboratories, having become
acquainted with forces at present unknown, which are already utilised by the Psyche."
(Die illagic nls Naturwissenschaft by Dr. Carl du Prel.)
We read of secret trade processes, discoveries or inventions being handed down from
father to son for many generations. Imagine for a moment that the ﬁrst of a line of gifted
inventors had four or ﬁve generations previous to Galvani stumbled upon Galvani's discovery
and that his descendants had made one advance after another in electric technicality and
handed them down secretly from father to son until the latest descendant had perfected the
apparatus known as wireless ; (a matter of four or ﬁve generations). Imagine such a latest
descendant emitting his wireless voices secretly into the air in the days when even the phono
graph was unborn and the telephone undreamed of, indeed electricity practically unknown and
its relation to magnetism unsuspected. What explanation could all the fellows of the Royal
Society or members of the Académie des Sciences give in such circumstances of the origin of
the mysterious sounds ? None whatever !
We are probably in the same position when we try to account for psychic phenomena.
In their search for some further instrument to enable their co-operatively constructed
being to obtain a happier existence or with no particular object in view, it is conceivable
that the ectoscopolitans of some individuals among us have invented apparatus which the
majority of us do not possess, apparatus which enables them to produce the phenomena
which are called psychic and to have the faculties which are called metagnomic. That these
powers are dependent on bodily structure (including in this term the qualities appertaining
to the soul) one may conclude for they appear to be heritable.
The above view of the part played by invention in man's organism enables one to
perceive dimly how William Hope and Mrs. Deane and other mediums for psychic photography
have been enabled of themselves, or with the help of agencies outside themselves, to produce
the various supernormal phenomena which numberless experiments have proved beyond
a shadow of doubt inexplicable by the theory of fraud.

PNEUMATOLOGY
Spontaneous and Experimental.
THE REALITY OF SPIRITS
AND THE
MARVELLOUS PHENOMENON OF THEIR DIRECT WRITING,
demonstrated by
BARON L. DE GULDENSTUBBIE, 1857.
ON
showing some of the direct writing results obtained by me with Mrs. Deane
in my H and F experiments described in chapter VII to a friend with a great
knowledge of psychic research, he called my attention to the above-mentioned
book. As this work is now out of print and not easily accessible it seemed to
me useful to include in this volume a short extract of the portions thereof
which deal with the experiments carried out by the Baron and his friends.
The results of genuine, careful experimentation should not be lost sight of.
It is hardly likely that the Baron would publish a book of lies, and there seems
to have been no opening for fraud.
The author was a spiritualist and ascribed all the results obtained to the
action of spirits and the writings to the actual presence of the great men
associated with the various scripts. I have let his wording stand as I found it.
In years to come a different interpretation may render the Baron's facts more
acceptable.
Robert Dale Owen (son of Robert Owen, father of the (Io-operative movement)
formerly Member of Congress (U.S.A.) and American Minister to Naples, met
Baron Guldenstubbé, a Russian nobleman of Livonia, in Paris, and writes of
him in his book The Debalable Land :—
"
Baron Guldenstubbé impressed me very favourably as a man of great
earnestness and perfect good faith. The multitude of his experiments
obtained under every variety of circumstance, and the number of respectable
witnesses who permit their names to appear in attestation of the results,
leave little room to doubt their genuine character."
Further on he writes in the same work :—
“
Count d'Ourches personally conﬁrmed to me the authenticity of these
two examples of spirit writing (as reproduced in the book) when I called on
him, October lst, 1858."
and again :—
“
I have since been fortunate enough to procure in the United States
personal evidence in corroboration of Direct Writing, and in some cases
this evidence was obtained under conditions so strict that I think any candid
and intelligent person, witnessing as I have, must cease to doubt."
age as GULDENSTUBBE
In a work entitled Three-score Years and Ten. Reminiscences of the late
Sophia Elizabeth de Morgan, edited by her daughter, the author says that during
the later visits of her husband (the eminent mathematician) to Lord Brougham
they had a good deal of conversation on the phenomena called spiritual. While
the late Lord Brougham was not much impressed by spiritualistic phenomena
he was greatly impressed by a book La Rﬁalité des Esjm0ts published by a certain
Baron Guldenstubbé, whom he knew personally and with many of whose witnesses
he was acquainted, including Mr. Dale Owen.
Mrs. de Morgan wrote :—“ He assured my husband that these were most
of them persons whose evidence would be held sufﬁcient to establish any fact
in everyday life."
Exlracls from Baron Guldenslubbé's Introduction.
A marvellous discovery has been made by the author in Paris on August 13th, 1850, the
day when the ﬁrst experiments were crowned with success, Le. direct and supemormal
writing by spirits without any intermediary whatsoever, that is to say, neither mediums
nor any inanimate objects.
The discovery of direct writing is all the more precious because it could be conﬁrmed
by repeated experiments by the author in the presence of unbelievers, who could them‘
selves try the paper in order to meet the absurd objection that chemically prepared papers
have been used
More than 500 experiments have been made since the ever memorable day of August
13th, 1856, by the author and his two friends, the Comte d'Ourches and General Baron de
Bréwern. More than ﬁfty persons, bringing their own paper, have been able to conﬁrm
the astounding phenomenon of direct writing by invisible entities. Here are the names of
some of the witnesses :—
. Ravené, senior, proprietor of a picture gallery in Berlin.
. 1e prince Léonide Galitzin, of Moscow.
. le prince S. Metschersky.
. le docteur Georgii.
. le colonel Toutcheﬂ.
. le docteur Bowron, Paris.
. Kiorboe, distinguished artist in Paris.
. le colonel de Kollrnann, Paris.
M. le baron de Voigts-Rhetz.
M. le baron Borys d'Uexkull.
The majority of these have attended several experiments.
Most of our experiments have taken place in the Salle des Antiques at the Louvre, in
the Cathedral of Saint-Denis, as well as at the Author's ﬂat, rue du Chemin de Versailles, 74,
where the ﬁrst phenomenon was observed on the 13th August, 1856.
The educated public knows that natural science made no real progress until one began
to question Nature by the experimental method. To-day, in psychic science as well as in the
exact sciences, our century demands facts and observations.
The Author gives sixty-seven facsimiles of direct writing by diﬂerent spirits from the
time of the hieroglyphics of Egypt, Ancient Greece and Rome, up to our days. The Author
is the possessor of more than 500 of these writings in twenty different languages, but he has
not published them all, in order not to render the book too voluminous.
It is also for this reason that the Author publishes only a few extracts from the writings
of Sympathetic Spirits, that is to say, Spirits of deceased relations and friends of the Author.
It is true that the majority of these letters from beyond the tomb, covering often several
pages, contain counsels, advice, and details too intimate to be given to the public. Never
theless, the Author, who possesses more than 200 writings from such Spirits, gives a few
extracts because these letters are of a certain importance, it being possible to conﬁrm the
identity of the hand-writing and of the signature, by those who have known these individuals
during their terrestrial life.
The most remarkable writings were signed (always in the presence of eye-witnesses) by
the greatest Spirits of antiquity, such as Plato, Isocrates, Cicero, Virgil, Julius Caesar,
Octavius Augustus, Juvenal, etc., and by the great apostles of Christianity, such as St. John
and St. Paul, and by Fathers of the Middle Ages, such as Abélard.
These Greek and Latin writings contain axioms, philosophy and ethics, concerning
chieﬂy the future life of man, or verses from the New Testament.
Kings and Queens of France, from Dagobert to Louis XVIII, from La Reine Blanche
to Marie-Antoinette. have drawn magic ﬁgures and the initials of their names on their
monuments at Saint-Denis, or Versailles, or at Fontainebleau ; we publish a few of them,
such as St. Louis, Francis lst, Marie-Antoinette and Mary Stuart.

GULDENSTUBBE' Page 36
These magic ﬁgures traced directly by Spirits have sometimes worked marvellous and
instantaneous cures when applied to invalids in accordance with the directions of the medium
or of the somnambule of the author, when sent to sleep by the said magic ﬁgures.
Already in the year 1850, about three years before the epidemic of table-rapping, the
Author interested himself in the subject of Spiritualism. It took him six months to form
a circle of friends for the purpose.
The Author made many experiments with his honorable friend, the Comte d'Ourches,
a man greatly versed in occult science. Little by little we were able to obtain movements
of the table without contact. M. is Comte d'Ourches was able to raise the table himself
without touching. The Author also was able to cause the table to move with great rapidity
without contact and without the assistance of any magnetic circle. It was the same with
regard to the vibrations of piano wires, a phenomenon obtained as early as jan. 1856, in
the presence of the Comtes de Szapary and d'Ourches.
All these phenomena revealed the reality of certain occult forces, but these facts did
not demonstrate sufﬁciently the real and substantial existence of invisible intelligences,
independent of our will and our imagination. In truth, there is only one phenomenon direct,
intelligent and material, independent of our will and our imagination, namely, direct writing
by Spirits, whom one has not evoked or invoked, which can serve as irrefragable proof of
the reality of the supernormal world.
The Author, being always in search of proof both intellectual and material (intelligente
cl palpable) of the substantial reality of the spiritual world, in order to demonstrate by
irrefragable facts the immortality of the soul, never ceased to pray for the knowledge of some
infallible means for the purpose.
One memorable day, 11e., 1st August, r856, the idea came into the Author's head to try
whether the Spirits would write directly without the intermediary of any medium. Mindful
of the direct and marvellous writing of the Decalogue according to Moses, and the equally
direct and marvellous writing which appeared at the Feast of Bel-shazzar, according to
Daniel; having also heard of the modern mysteries at Stratford in America, the Author
wished to conﬁrm the reality of a phenomenon of such far-reaching signiﬁcance—whether
it did really exist.
He therefore put a piece of plain writing paper and a pointed pencil in a box which he
locked, carrying the key always with him and telling nobody of his experiment. He waited
in vain for twelve days without noticing the least trace of the pencil on the paper, but what
was his astonishment when on the 13th August, 1856, he found certain mysterious letters
traced on the paper. Hardly had he noticed these letters when he repeated the same
experiment ten times on this ever-memorable day by putting, every half-hour, a fresh piece
of paper in the same box. The experiment was crowned with success every time.
The next day, August 14th, the Author made twenty experiments, leaving the box
open, and not letting it out of his sight ; it was then that the Author saw that some letters
and words in the Esthonian language were formed or were engraved upon the paper without
the pencil moving.
Since that moment, seeing the uselessness of the pencil, he ceased to put it with the
paper. He placed simply a. sheet of white paper on the table at his own house, or on the
pedestals of ancient statues, on tombs, urns, etc., at the Louvre, at St. Denis, at the Church
of St. Etienne-du-Mont, etc. The same thing happened with experiments made in different
cemeteries.
After having conﬁrmed the reality of the phenomenon of direct writing by more than
thirty repeated experiments, the principal preoccupation of the Author was to demonstrate
the real existence of this miracle to other people. First of all he addressed himself to his
honorable friend, M. le Comte d'Ourches, who has also consecrated his entire life to magic
and Spiritualism.
It was only after six such sittings, on the r6th August, 1856, at eleven o'clock in the
evening, that M. le Comte d'Ourches saw, for the ﬁrst time, this marvellous phenomenon.
He was at ﬁrst upset by the non-success of our experiments. He put on one side of the
piece of white paper intended for the writing of any Spirit whatsoever, a copy of the famous
criterion of St. John on the subject of the discerning of good Spirits. After ten minutes
a sympathetic Spirit, whose writing and signature the Author recognised later, wrote directly
in the presence of the Comte d'Ourches, the following words :
"
]e confesse ]ésus en chair."
The Spirit therefore accepted frankly the sign by which, according to St. John, a good
Spirit is recognised.
Since that time, M. le Comte d'Ourches has seen more than forty times this marvellous
phenomenon of direct writing, sometimes at his own house, sometimes at the Author's, also
at the Louvre, at the Cathedral of St. Denis, at the Church of St. Etiennedu-Mont, on the
sarcophagus of St. Genevieve, and on the seats which are below the monuments of Pascal
and Racine at the Montmartre Cemetery.
Later, in the month of October, M. le Comte d'Ourches obtained, even without the
assistance of the Author, several direct writings from Spirits. One of these letters from
bﬂyond the tomb is from his mother, who had died twenty years previously.
Page 366 GULDENSTUBBE
The Author could record a mass of very interesting experiences but, in order to avoid
prolixity, he prefers to publish exact fac-similes of the most remarkable writings.
As to the question of knowing what means the Spirits employ to trace characters or
magic ﬁgures on a sheet of paper, it must be agreed that this phenomenon demonstrates to
us that the Spirits act directly on matter, just as our souls are embedded in gross matter.
During the ﬁrst fortnight succeeding the day of the discovery of direct writing, the tables
upon which the Spirits wrote moved themselves about without contact, and came to join the
Author in another room, after having traversed several apartments. Sometimes the tables
moved slowly, sometimes with an astonishing quickness. The Author often barred their
road with chairs, but they made digressions, always towards the same direction. The
Author has even seen, on two occasions, a small occasional table upon which the Spirits were
in the habit of writing (in his presence) transported in the air from one end of the room to
the other.
Nevertheless, although the effects of the inﬂuence of discarnate Spirits are the same
as those of incarnate Spirits, it must be acknowledged that their means must differ from
ours, their condition being free from the yoke of matter, which paralyses the sublime will of
our intelligence and of our imagination,
Before publishing a selection of fac-similes of these writings from beyond the tomb,
it is necessary to say a few words in order to refute the absurd objection that would reduce
this marvellous phenomenon to a strange reﬂection of the thought of the Author. Our
experiments prove amply that the reﬂection of thoughts has nothing to do with this
phenomenon. First of all, generally the Spirit we are desirous of having in our experiment
does not present itself for writing; another one comes, of whom we had not thought at
all, and of whom the name is quite unknown to us at times. As regards the sympathetic
Spirits, they hardly ever come during Spiritualistic experiments. The Spirits often write
several entire pages, sometimes in pencil, sometimes in ink, when the Author is attending to
other matters. The hypothesis that the power of the imagination and of the will has to do
with this business, is in ﬂagrant disaccord with our 500 experiments, the Author not having
recourse, as a rule, to the mental evocation of any particular Spirit. Even the desire to
communicate with one Spirit rather than another is banished from our sittings, because in
this way one can prevent direct communication through lack of sympathy.
The absurd fear of demons, born especially in the Middle Ages, is precisely the principal
cause of the rarity of supernormal phenomena, Spirits not being able to manifest to people
who regard them as something not of this world. In fact, there is nothing which repels
Spirits, and indeed corporeal and living beings such as men and animals, more than invincible
repugnance, frightful horror, and the absolute lack of sympathy.
CHAPTER VlII.
This chapter contains sixty-seven fac-similes of Spirit writings. The chronological order
of these phenomena is followed, indicating exactly the date, the place, and the witnesses
in whose presence the writings were made. Some of these writings are illustrated on p. 367.
From the 13th August, 1856 up to the 15th of the same month, we obtained only lines
and magic ﬁgures which were sometimes very complicated. The ﬁrst legible writing,
which was in the Esthonian language by a Spirit whom the Author recognised by his hand
writing, although at ﬁrst the signature was missing, took place on the 15th August. I am
not publishing it because it was not written in the presence of witnesses. The ﬁrst writing
in French was obtained on the 16th August in the presence of witnesses. For this reason
we are publishing it (see No. 3 in illustration below).
In the preface we have already cited the names of the most celebrated Spirits who
have conﬁrmed their writings by their signatures from beyond the tomb; we are adding
here a few illustrious names such as Héloise, la. swur Louise de la IiIiséricorde, at one time
Duchess de La Valliere, the famous diacre of Paris, etc. We obtained these particular
writings by the direct solicitation, written in French, of a sympathetic Spirit of a young
woman, anonymous.

also invited to attend, but were absent. Their coming was awaited until nearly
midnight, but as that hour drew near, the furniture began to creak, the medium
seated himself at the piano, and commanded us to put a case of letter-paper, which
was covered with a yellow paper and sealed just as it had left the shop, on a little
table. After a quarter of an hour, the medium ceased playing, and asked the
Baron de Bréwern to open the packet ; ﬁrst of all was found a Greek writing signed
by Plato, then a Latin writing signed by Cicero; a third piece of paper contained
this ﬁgure of which we have just been speaking (No. 48). A fourth sheet of paper

[In Transcendental Physics, written by Johann C. F. Z6llner, Professor of Physical
Astronomy at the University of Leipzig, the following note is to be found concerning
Dr. Hare :—
"
Robert Hare, Doctor of Medicine, Professor of Chemistry at the University of
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia; born 1771, died 15th May, 1858. In Poggendorff's
Literary Biographical Dictionary, from which I have taken the above particulars, will
be found a catalogue, ﬁlling a whole column, of Hare's numerous chemical and physical
treatises. In text-books of Physics his name survives in the so-called
"
Hare's Spiral,"
a galvanic element. With this, previously to the construction of constant batteries,
very strong effects of light and heat could be produced."
Alfred Russel Wallace devoted several pages of his well-known Miracles and Il0lodern
Spiritualism to Dr. Hare's work in Psychics, and mentioned that Dr. Hare invented the
oxyhydrogen blowpipe. As Alfred Russel Wallace's description is not illustrated I am
inserting the illustrations herein to enable readers to repeat Dr. Hare's experiments,
and add to his valuable experimental evidence of facts at present inexplicable.
Before Dr. Hare commenced his investigations into the phenomena of table turning
and all associated with it, he was (par. 133 of his book) incredulous of any cause of the
phenomena excepting unconscious muscular action on the part of the persons with whom
the phenomena were associated. The inferences of Faraday tending to the same conclusion
he thoroughly sanctioned. He wrote a letter to this effect which was published in the
Philadelphia Inquirer in July 1853, in answer to an enquiry made of him.
In par. 134 Dr. Hare states that as no allusion to spirits as the cause of the phenomena
had been made in the letter which drew forth his writing, spirits were not contemplated in
his review of the subject. He adds, had he ever heard spiritual agency assigned as a cause,
so great was his disbelief in any such agency it would have made no impression on his
memory.
In par. 135 of his book Dr. Hare states that in common with almost all educated persons
of the 19th century, he had been brought up deaf to any testimony which claimed assistance
from supernatural causes such as ghosts, magic or witchcraft.
Notwithstanding the scepticism with which he started his investigations, after pro
longed experiments the results obtained convinced him there was a power at work not
that of any human being present, and, in addition to the power, there was an intelligence.
"
After a year of experiment, even though it meant eating his own words and scientiﬁc
martyrdom, he announced that he had been entirely converted .... ..l<lis report was the whole
hearted utterance of a brave man who has done an injustice and spares himself nothing,
either in personal vanity or in worldly disadvantage, in his attempt to remedy it." (Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle on Dr. Hare, quoted in Light, I921, p. 43.)]

FULLER DETAILS OF DR. HARE0S EXPERIMENTS WITH HIS APPARATUS
WILL BE FOUND IN HIS BOOK, PAGES 40 TO 52.
THE FOLLOWING NOTES ARE DR. HARE0S OWN, ABBREYIATED.
PLATE I.
Fig. I is an engraving from a photograph of the apparatus above alluded to. The
lettered disc "A" is seen supported upon a stationary rod of iron forming the axis on which
the disc turns. To the outer end of this rod, the pointer “B " is alhxcd, so as to be
stationary in a vertical position. The cord
“
C" encircles the grooved pulley, which is
ﬁxed on the centre of the disc, like a hub to a carriage wheel. The ends of the cord are
severally tied to weights, which, when the table is tilted, react against each other through
the pulley ; one being so heavy as to be immovable, the other so light as to be lifted. Of
course, a hook in the ﬂoor may be substituted for the larger weight.
The relative position of the medium and of the screen intercepting her view of the disc,
are too obvious to require particularisation.
0n tilting the table, the cord would be unwound from the pulley on the side of the
larger weight, being wound up simultaneously to an equivalent extent on the side of the
small weight, causing the pulley and disc to rotate about the axle. Restoring the table
to its normal position, the smaller weight being allowed to act unresistcd upon the cord
and pulley, the rotation would be reversed. Of course, any person actuating the table and
seeing the letters, could cause the disc so to rotate as to bring any letter under the index ;
but should the letters be concealed from the operator, no letter could be brought under the
index at will.
Hence it was so contrived that neither the medium seated at the table behind the
screen, nor any other person so seated, could, by tilting the table, bring any letter of the
alphabet under the index, nor spell out any word requested.
Fig. 2 represents a similar piece of apparatus known as Pease's disc. It consists of a
box
" F "
which is a miniature representation of a low, square, four-sided house, with a single
sloping roof, but without any ﬂoor closing it at the bottom. On the outside of the part
serving as the roof, the0alphabet dial is depicted. On the inner surface of the roof board,
a pulley, strings and a spring are attached, by which the index is made to revolve to and fro,
so as to point to any letter. A detailed description of the orientation of these is hardly
necessary.
" G
"
represents a lever oscillating on a rod. The medium's hands are placed on this lever.
When test conditions are not required, the hands should be situated so that one-half may be
on either side of the fulcrum rod. When test conditions are required, the hands should be
altogether on the portion of the board which is between the exterior end of the board and
the fulcrum. When this end of the lever is depressed the cord is not pulled and the pointer
is not moved. When thus placed it is utterly impossible for the medium's hands to move
the lever so as to cause it to select letters or to alter the selection made by the unknown
power which may be in some unknown way operating the apparatus.
Letters were selected and messages given under these conditions.
It is surprising with what readiness the invisible operator, even when unused to the
apparatus, by moving the lever, actuated the index, causing it to point to the letters, words,
or ﬁgures distributed on the face of the disc. I
The apparatus above described may be arranged to operate by means of a string
extending from a brass ring, in which the pulley string terminates externally, to a heavy
weight or hook situated upon the ﬂoor, so as to be taut when at rest. When this arrange
ment is made, tilting of the table, by raising the end at which the box is situated, causes the
weight to pull the string, and, of course, to induce the revolution of the pulley, its pivot and
corresponding pointer. The restoration of the table to its usual position reverses the motion.
Hence by these means the index may be moved either way, as requisite for the selection of
the letters required for communication.
DR. HARE Page 373
PLATE l
The other ﬁgure in the same plate represents Pease's disc apparatus, so arranged as to
be afﬁxed to any table of moderate dimensions. The fulcrum on which the lever turns is so
made as to be affixed to one of the table's edges by clamps, while the disc situated in a
vertical plane is supported by a bar which has a clamp to secure it to the table, while to
the disc it is fastened by being introduced into square staples, made to receive it securely
in a clip resembling that by which a square bolt is secured. On the under surface of the
lever a hollow wire is fastened by staples, so as to receive a solid wire, which can be made
to slide further in or out and thus adjust itself to the distance. The disc can be placed
edgeways so that a medium cannot read it.
[Dr. Hare gives particulars of various successful test experiments which he made with
the pieces of apparatus above depicted. It is not necessary to give the details here. It is
obvious how well these instruments lend themselves to fraud-proof trials. To render the
results more unquestionable the doctor interposed a screen between the disc and the eyes of
the medium, without causing any arrestation of the process.
On occasions the doctor altered the position of the medium to the other end of the
table from her position shown in the sketch, Fig. I. In this position it was necessary for the
table to rise under the medium's hands for the index to0be actuated. With this modiﬁcation
the doctor had success.]

PLATE ll.
Descriplion 0/ lhe inslrumenl by which lhe opcralors were enabled f0 move a table
under the inﬂuence of mediumship, gel in no wise under fhe control of lhe medium
employed, even clairvoyance being eliminaled.
The table is about six feet in length (to preclude all possibility of the medium's contact
with the table legs) and sixteen inches in width, so contrived as to separate into three parts
for convenience of carriage.
The pair of legs under the right side are upon castors; those upon the left side are
upon two wheels each of about six inches diameter, of which one is grooved. A lettered
disc similar to that already described on a preceding page, is secured upon a pivot affixed
to a strip of wood, which is made to slide between two other strips attached to the frame of
the table just under the top board. By this means the cord running in the groove of the
hub of the disc and the groove of the leg-wheel can be rendered taut ; when the leg-wheel
revolves in consequence of the moving of the table horizontally along the ﬂoor, the disc
revolves also. A nine-inch movement causes the disc to make a complete revolution.
Or, by attaching the two ends of a cord to two stationary weights the cord actuating
the pulley is made to pull it round by a horizontal motion of the table, as in the drill-bow
process.
To neutralise the power of the medium to move the table voluntarily, the hands of the
medium were placed upon a metallic plate made quite true and this plate rested upon some
brass balls, like billiard balls, as shown in the sketch.
The index is in this apparatus situated precisely as in that described in Plate I ; and
any mortal may, by moving the table one way or the other, bring any letter under the index,
so as to spell out any desired word. But no person sitting as the medium is, in the engraving
represented to sit, with hands on the plate resting on two balls, can actuate the disc so as to
spell out words as above mentioned. Utterly incapacitated from moving the table (for much
less force would make the tray move on the balls than would move the table) it is manifestly
impossible for the medium to actuate the disc, or to interfere with the movements of it.
It has been suggested that in the employment of the apparatus (Plate 1) the medium
might see the letters by clairvoyance, in despite of the screen, or might learn them from the
mind of the observer; but in this apparatus (Plate II) the medium cannot control the
movements of the disc in the least, whatever she may have learnt clairvoyantly or otherwise.
On the surface of the table, on the left, may be seen a board upon castors. This was
contrived as a substitute for the plate on balls. The castors, of course, perform the same
ofﬁce as the balls.
As soon almost as the medium placed her hands on the plate resting on the balls and
without any other communication with the table, the disc began to revolve in such a way
as to bring the letters under the index in due alphabetic order. Afterwards various names
were spelled, and communications were made.
On various subsequent occasions I have had this experiment of putting the hands of the
medium on a plate and balls repeated, and with the same result. The interposition of the
plate and balls makes it much more dilhcult for spirits to move a table than when the hands
are directly applied. In the latter case, the spirits actuate the hands primarily, and the table
or apparatus secondarily; but when the hands are incapacitated from inﬂuencing the motion
the spirit has to assail the inanimate matter directly, assisted only by an emanation from
the medium. In this attack upon ponderable matter, the spirits of the second sphere are the
most capable; but even with their assistance, the condition of the medium must be very
favourable to render success possible.

By means of this apparalus the medium is prevcnlecf from having any communicalion
will: lhe apparafus olhcr than lhroug/l wafer. Yef under ffiese circumsfances the spring
balance indicated lhe excrlion of a force equal lo [8 pounds.
A board is supported on a rod so as to make it serve as a fulcrum, as in a see-saw,
excepting that the fulcrum is at a distance of a foot from one end and three feet from the
other. The latter end is supported by a spring-balance which indicates pounds and ounces
by a rotary index.
In the board at about six inches from the fulcrum, there is a hole into which the knob
of an inverted glass bell jar, nine inches in diameter, is inserted
Upon two iron rods proceeding vertically from a board resting on the ﬂoor, in such
a position that one is on either side of the vase, a cage of wire webbing, such as is used to
protect food from ﬂies, of about ﬁve inches in diameter, is held (inverted) by the rods so
that it is within the vase concentrically, with a free space between it and the sides of the
vase of about an inch and a space of an inch and a half between it and the bottom of the
vase.
The vase being ﬁlled with water to within an inch of the brim, the medium's hands
were introduced into the cage and thus prevented from touching the vase.
These arrangements being made, the operators were invoked to show their power,
when repeatedly the spring balance indicated an augmentation of weight equal to three pounds.
The relative distances of the vase and balance from the fulcrum being as 6 to 36, the force
exerted must have been 3 x 6 m 18 pounds ; yet the medium did not appear to be subjected
to any re-action, and declared that he experienced none.
It was on stating this result to the Association for the Advancement of Science that I
met with much the same reception as the King of Ava gave to the Dutch Ambassador, who
alleged water to be at times solidiﬁed in his country by cold, so as to be walked upon.
The belief in spiritual agency was treated as a mental disease, with which I, of course,
had been infected; those who made this charge being perfectly unconscious that their
education has associated morbid incredulity with bigoted and fanatical credence.
[These experiments with a bowl of water on a lever seem to have forcstalled Sir Wm.
Crooke's similar experiments.]
When a medium, eleven years old, placed his hands on the short end, that end rose
while the other, of course, went down ; in some instances, showing an increase of downward
pressure on the balance, equivalent to seven pounds.
This experiment was subsequently repeated at my laboratory, in the presence of
John M. Kennedy. Esq.
Having a basin of water on the board, the boy's hands being merely immersed in the
water, and not touching the parietes of the containing vessel; the balance was affected as
in the experiments above described, although not to so great an extent. In one case,
Mr. Kennedy satisﬁed himself that the medium did not touch the vessel by placing his own
hands below those of the medium.
My much-esteemed friend, Prof. Henry, having treated this result as incredible, I was
induced to repeat it with the greatest precision and precaution.
Water was poured into the vase so as to rise into the cage to within about an inch
and a half of the brim.
A well-known medium (Gordon) was induced to plunge his hands, clasped together, to
the bottom of the cage, holding them perfectly still. As soon as these conditions were
attained, the apparatus being untouched by any one excepting the medium as described,
I invoked the aid of my spirit friends. A downward force was repeatedly exerted upon the
end of the board appended to the balance equal to three pounds weight, nearly.
It will be perceived that in this manifestation, the medium had no means of communi
cation with the board, besides the water. It was not until he became quite still, that the
invocation was made. Nevertheless, he did not appear to be subjected to any reacting
force. Yet, the distance of the book of the balance from the fulcrum on which the board
turned, was six times as great as the cage in which the hands were situated. Consequently,
a force of 3 x 6 =18 pounds must have been exerted. The board would probably have been
depressed much more, but that the water would have been spilled by any further inclination
of the vase. This experiment has since been repeated again and again, but on a smaller
scale, when, not only the downward force was exercised, but the spelling of words was
accomplished. On one occasion, when no result ensued, it appeared to arise from the water
being so cold as to chill the medium, because, on warming it up to a comfortable temperature,
the desired manifestations were obtained.

Pl .ATE IV
The apparafus Jepicled on Plale IV are similar In those illuslraled by Fig. 2 on Plale
I and the ﬁgure on Plale II buf are so construcled Iliaf fhey can be placed on any table.
In these apparatus the discs are made to revolve under a stationary index; while in
l'ease's apparatus the index revolves, the disc remaining at rest. The advantage of having
the disc to revolve is, that the letter is always to he looked for at the same spot; whereas
in operating with the moving index the eye has to follow the index through all its rapid
movements.
The lettered disc is so ﬁxed that it may be turned half round so as to place the lettered
surface out of the sight of the medium, whose power to inﬂuence the communication is thus
nulliﬁed._ This is one mode of attaining test conditions; in other words, those conditions
which make it impossible that the communications received should be due to any mortal
unless, as gratuitously and erroneously, as I believe, alleged, the medium sees the letters by
clairvoyance.
Clairvoyance can be totally eliminated by the hands of the medium being placed on the
end portion of the lever where pressure has no effect on the disc whatsoever, that is, not
beyond the line
"
FL." The medium cannot then move the rod
" R
"
upwards because it
is already pressing against the lower edge of the disc, and the medium's hands are on the
wrong side of the fulcrum to give a downward movement to it. Successful experiments with
this apparatus under above detailed conditions prove that the correct spelling out of messages
was not helped by clairvoyance on the part of the medium.
The apparatus Fig. 2 is analogous in its mode of operating to that represented in Plate II.
it is in the substitution of a small board for a table that the principal difference consists.
There is also this difference, that in Fig. 2 the board is supported by only three wheels, so
as to have one in front under the hands of the medium, by which sufﬁcient pressure is secured
to make the rotation certain. But as the position thus given does not fall into the plane of
the pulley at the back of the disc. the wheel in question is supported upon an axle which is
secured in staples or holes, and carries a pulley just at the position where it is coincident
with the plane aforesaid. The wheel is visible in front. The board requires only to be
large enough to allow the hands to rest upon it in front of the disc. The index is actuated
by a horizontal motion to and fro, which, as in the apparatus, Plate II, causes the rotation
of a supporting wheel, which, by means of a band communicates rotation to a pulley
supported behind the disc on the pivot to which the index is secured in front. The sliding
pulley
"
P "
being fastened at a due distance from the disc
"
o
" is used to keep the band
tight.
This instrument is preferred by the
“
operators
" and is easier for a feeble medium to
employ effectually. I [Dr. Hare] cannot as yet avail myself of the apparatus Fig. l ; through
apparatus Fig. 2 l have had some interesting tests. This form, then, is best for incipient
mediumship.
Fig. 2 may be employed under test conditions, by so arranging it that the dial be on
the side opposite to that where the medium sits; under these circumstances the medium
cannot see the index or the letters, and consequently cannot control the spelling. This mode
of testing does not preclude the hypothesis so often resorted to, of clairvoyant power,
enabling the medium so see through the disc or read the letters in the minds of the bystanders.
To eliminate the possibility of clairvoyance and subconscious action on the part of the
medium the medium's bands can be placed upon a board supported by two balls as detailed
in connection with Plate ll.
Fig. 3, Plate IV, is a representation of an association of serrated strips of iron in a
wooden frame which slides in the lever board of Fig. i. so as to have the teeth just above the
backs of the hands of the medium. It is found to increase the efﬁcacy of the mediumship.
It is only of importance to use it when test conditions are requisite.
It will be perceived that the size of the frame in the sketch is not in due proportion to
the lever board, being upon a larger scale. This enlargement is to render its construction
more clear ; the reader can easily conceive its size to be such as to allow the groove in the
wooden sides of the frame to receive the edges of the lever board
" L," and thus to be
secured ﬁrmly thereupon.

Page 380 Par. (374) BIBLIOGRAPHY
(37 4) A supplementary list of Books and Periodicals dealing
with Psychic Photography and Allied Subjects.
In the Proc. of the S.I’.R., Vol. VII, pp. 260 and 270 (189r-92) is an article by Mrs. Ilenry
Sidgwick on Spirit Photography being a reply to Alfred Russel Wallace. Mrs. Sidgwick
gives a list of the periodicals and books where evidence on the subject may be found, and
with her permission I reproduce that list here.
"
A collection of the evidence on the subject was made by
0
M.A. (Oxon.),' in a series of
papers contributed to Human Nature in 1874 and 1875, and this is the best summary of it
which I have seen. It needs supplementing, however. In particular Mr. Beattic's accounts
of his own experiments (see The British journal of Photography for 1872 and 1873; The
Spiritualist for july, 1872; The Spiritual .Maga2ine for Sept, 1872, abbreviated slightly
from The Spiritualist; and The Spiritual Magazine for November, 1873, from The British
journal of Photography) should be read. Some of the evidence scattered through The
Spiritual Maga2ine from 1872 to 1875 is important, though the best is given by
'
M.A.
(Oxon.).' Also much light is thrown on the subject by the controversy about the genuine
ness of Hudson's photographs in The Spiritual lllaga2inc and The Spiritualist for 1872, and by
the trial of Buguet, for accounts of which see various numbers of The Spiritualist for 1875
and 1876, and especially Madame Leymarie's Procés des Spirites (Paris, 1875). Mr. Wallace
devotes several pages to the subject of spirit photography in his .Miracles and Modern
Spiritualism. The Spiritual illaga2ine for 1869 gives the trial of Mumler, and The Spiritual
Maga2ine for 1862 and 1863 contains some account of Mumler's early performances at Boston.
To these references I must now (1891) add M. Aksakof's Animismus unrl Spiritismus (Leipzig,
1800), in which a long chapter devoted to the subject contains some additional evidence."

Account(ex. Mrs. Mcl\'enzie's notes) of a test sitting given by Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton
for Mr. James Douglas, editor of the Sunday Express, and Sir G. —— (Feb. 23rd, 1922).
These two gentlemen were alone with Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton and the only weak
point in the experiment was the fact that the camera was left in Mr. Hope's presence while
the plates were being inserted into the slide in the darkroom.
One of the Extras obtained on this occasion, which took the form of a ring two inches
in diameter, reminds one of the Extra Fig. 164, p.91.
October, 1922, p. 243. Mrs. Stobart gives an account of a test experiment she had with
.\lr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton at the B.C.P.S. on March 11th, 1921. Her plates had been
secretly marked by the Kodak Company. From start to ﬁnish neither Hope nor Mrs. Buxton
handled the plates at all and when developed two of the four had Extras, one of them
being a full length ﬁgure of a woman clothed in the usual ﬁlmy drapery. Both the plates
bore the secret marks made by the Kodak Co.

had his lower jaw removed. No photograph was taken of him in life in that condition."
P. 83. Charles Lyle's own stereoscopic camera. Hope never touched the slides or
the camera. Of a pair of plates one was normal and the other had a 3-in. x 1-in. cloud
across it. He wrote: "
To me it is absolute proof (although I have had it before) that
these markings are abnormal.“

SUPPLEMENT.
Before finally closing this work, I find on looking through my notes and illultrations
come which I had omitted, and which I now think may possibly be of ale to future
investigator: of the eubjectl dealt with.
Goliglier Phenomena
at the home of Mr. (5' Mrs. Donaldson ut Belfast.
Pholograph taken with infra-ml rays.
On pages 352 to 356 I give an account of various results obtained by Mr. Donaldson
with his wife as medium (better known as Kate Goligher) by means of infra-red photography.
Mr. Donaldson has more recently kindly given me one of the ﬁrst of such photographs with
permission to reproduce it. In this experiment a box about 12 inches high was placed on
the ﬂoor about 15 inches from the toes of the sitting medium ; in the same line, about 25
inches further away, a camera was on the ﬂoor and, still further away, the source of the infra
red rays. The box is covered partly with brown paper; two drawing-pins can be seen
through the material.
Fig. G/Io Fig. G/rr
The photograph is illustrated by two half-tone blocks, the one(Fig. (Mio)quite untouched,
the other(Fig. G/I r)as touched up by the block-maker's artist who was instructed to accentuate
the thin extension cord (only) just as he saw it in the photograph.
Mr. Donaldson requested of the control that the emanation should be put on the box.
The photograph shows it on the side of the box facing the camera. The thread-like
extension at the end would have a diameter at least four times greater than that seen in the
picture. In the photograph the thread-like body is one hundreth of an inch in diameter, as
near as its lack of sharp deﬁnition allows one to measure it under the microscope. The
actual diameter would therefore be about one twenty-ﬁfth of an inch.
Some of the Kate Goligher phenomena depicted in Dr. Crawford's work Psychic Structures
(see page 352, (368) herein) suggest apported mundane material and not ectoplasm. The
above photograph perhaps lends support to this view.

Goligher sitting of 27th March, I933
Fig. (,i/12 Fig. G/l3
Present Mr. Donaldson. his wife (née Kate Goligher) who was the medium—Mr. Goligher
(Mrs. D's father), Mr. Smyth an intimate friend of the family and Mr. F. McC. Stephenson.
Five persons in all. The sitting was in darkness. Mr. Donaldson controlled the infra-red
light.
The medium's arms and ankles were controlled electrically, each separately, so that
any active movement of any one of the four limbs would have removed a plug and thereby
extinguished one of four electric bulbs which were in a box the lid of it being a screen shutting
out all but infra-red rays. Through this screen Mr. Stephenson was watching the tour lamps.
He sat on one side of the medium (Fig. G/12) Mr. Smyth on the other. At 'the termination
of the sitting all four plugs were as at the commencement.
Two of the photographs obtained of the only emanation which appeared on this occasion
are reproduced above. Figs. G/12 and G/i3. The latter has been very slightly retouchcd.
Further remarkson and illustrations of skolographic productions of
Mrs. Donohoe.
On pages 327 to 346 will be found some particulars of Mrs. Donohoe's work. The
reader has been given in those pages all the facts of the cases as far as known to the author.
Each reader will form his own opinion—there are some very curious features about these
skotographs which number now over 4, 500 messages in code, portraits, vases of ﬂowers (i),
pictures illustrating a story of Egypt and one of Greece.
The opinion of some, perhaps of most, concerning these skotographs, will be, not
withstanding the {acts mentioned on pp. 327 to 336, that there has been trickery somehow
throughout.
Many spiritualists may adopt Mrs. Donohoe's view, namely that all her output is the
work of M.D. (her late husband), C.D. (Conan Doyle) and others who have passed on.
There may be a third class, who, having studied the bulk of the skotographs and the
circumstances connected with them, and having had practical experience of the extra
ordinary psychic results obtained in the presence of an earnest, trustful, undoubting possessor

of a special psychic endowment, will regard Mrs. Donohoe's skotographic messages, pictures,
etc., not as the results of trickery, but as, possibly, the work of some unknown and
unimaginable faculty possessed by Mrs. Donohoe (allied to the faculty possessed by those
in whose presence psychic photographs appear) or some outside intelligence which uses
from Mrs. Donohoe's subconsciousness phrases and pictures Mrs. Donohoe's scholarship
and literary ability could well give birth to, a la Hélene Smith of Professor Flournoy's
Des Indes
(o1
la Planéte Mars.
As a gatherer of facts likely to interest students of psychics the author puts in this
supplement additional illustrations of Mrs. Donohoe's skotographs.
Among Mrs. Donohoe's skotographs are many portraits. Some of these have been
recognised.
I
give an account here of the circumstances attending two of the recognitions.
One is that of the son of the well-known medium Mr. Arthur Ford.
Mrs. Donohoe's account of this
is
as follows :—
At a sitting Mrs. Donohoe had in October, 1933, with the well-known medium,
Mrs. Eileen Garrett, Mr. Arthur Ford's control, Fletcher, spoke through the medium in
trance mentioning Mr. Ford's little son who had been drowned some months previousl_y.‘
Mrs. Donohoe thereupon requested Fletcher to give her
a
skotographic picture of the child.
When, a few days later, she found on one of her plates a portrait of a little boy who seemed
to her to bear a resemblance to Mr. Ford, she sent
it
to him and he at once wrote conﬁrming
that
it
was indeed his son.
Mr. Ford gave a full account of this in Light of the 24th August, 1934. In this he
wrote
:
"
One of the teachers in the school which he [his son] was attending at the time of
the tragedy asked me
if
I
would like some snapshots of the boy taken
a
week before he
was drowned. Among them was one identical in every essential detail to the skotograph
from Mrs. Donohoe".
Another was that connected with a Miss Eva Barrett.
In the spring of 1936 Miss Eva Barrett, professional photographer at Rome, member
of the Professional Photographers' Association of London. reading about Mrs. Donohoe's
skotographic results and desirous of making experiments in that way herself, wrote
Mrs. Donohoe, whom she did not remember having ever seen, for directions. Mrs Donohoe
gave her instructions how to proceed and mentioned that she had been photographed at
Miss Barrett's studio in Rome and met Miss Barrett on that occasion.
Among the skotographic portraits Mrs. Donohoe obtains weekly was one of a boy with
the name Alfred Barrett in code letters under it. Mrs. D. sent this to Miss Barrett asking
whether
it
had anything to do with her.
Miss Barrett wrote that the picture is an excellent likeness of her father's oldest and
favourite grandson. Dick Hicks, who
is
living and at school. Her father's name
is
Alfred
Barrett. Miss Barrett added
"
that
it
is
a
good portrait of this boy
is
not disputed by any
of our family. He has not been photographed for seven years and there
is
no photograph
of him like this in existence."
At her home circle in her studio in Rome Miss Barrett had asked her father (who passed
over four years previously) at four different sittings to try to send her his picture.
Miss Barrett writes that she always kept careful notes of every sitting and that the notes
of these sittings are available. She adds that Mrs. Donohoe knows nothing of her family.
A
Donohoe skotographic picture and code message.
D/IOOo the message, D/iool the
picture appertaining thereto.
The message ran :ﬁ
"Our many thanks are due to all who
have lent their help with the messages.
(LC. [Golden Cloud] speaks a some
what broken language. He has a wonderful
crystal ball which slowly revolves, and
on this were depicted the many scenes of
long past and forgotten history.
As he unfolded the story, we wrote
it
down. Then we found an artist to
sketch the scenes as they passed before us.
Afterwards they were arranged and
given to the control for transmission.

Page 392
On some actual criticisms made upon my work
by students of psychics.
Sceptic No. I : Mrs. Deane learnt the Greek Alphabet as soon as you started using it.
Answer: I introduced Greek letters without warning and commenced with Omega,
which she did not know was a Greek letter (page 170, Fig. 290).
Mrs. Deane would not write the Greek "pi" nor the Greek
"
phi" in cursive form
even if she had learnt the Greek Alphabet (nor were these cursive forms known to the
author), (page 187, Fig. 310).
-
Sceptic No. 2: Mrs. Deane went to the small town of Wymondham and sought out the
Burnside group photograph and copied it (without arousing suspicionl). (Page 40, Fig. 95).
Answer: The portrait in the group photograph is not a replica of the Extra.
Sceptic No. 3 : When I obtained the rings (page 183, Fig. 315) this sceptic suggested
that I had absent-mindedly put them on the large sheet of footpaper at my office when
dealing with my brass pieces.
Answer: This was suggested a few hours after the experiment when my memory of
the details was quite fresh and I answered then and answer now that this was not the case.
I should indeed be an incompetent person if I did such a thing—besides, the ring came on
the head paper as well and the colour was not and is not that (violet) of the only ink pad
for rubber stamps I possessed and I never had any occasion to make impressions of my
brass pieces. In addition, I obtained the large sheet of paper from stock immediately
before leaving my ofﬁce. To me the suggestion is absurd.
Sceptic No. 4 : Mrs. Deane liberated her hands from the stocks without my knowledge
(see the many experiments with hand-stocks recorded in chapter \''II, especially page 160).
Answer: Could not be done without my seeing or hearing her action as must be per
fectly obvious to every one. I had a red torch lamp to supplement the red light of the
darkroom and used it whenever there was any sound. To perform the many actions
necessary to produce the results obtained when Mrs. Deane's hands had been imprisoned,
had she freed them, would have been impossible without my detecting her, as I think any
reasonable person will agree (see pages 159-160, Figs. 263-266, page 164, Figs. 273A and
2738).
Sceptic No. 5 : When mental and not open suggestions were made the thought-of word
slipped accidentally through my lips on each occasion.
Answer: When this happened I have reported it. I know it did not happen on other
occasions, and Mrs. Deane has proved to me her telepathic ability several times (see Index
—Clairvoyance).
Sceptic No. 6: Among the results obtained during my experiments proving the
presence of some very intelligent power with means at his disposal which it is difficult to
conceive, were those of the fourth experiment of 15th Dec., 1924, page 13r. Figs. 224 and
225, when I suggested an arabic 2.
On my pointing out the impossibility of Mrs. Deane producing a line of such uniform
thinness it was suggested that it could have been done with a steel pen.
Answer : In this suggestion the conditions of the experiment are totally ignored, also
the blue colour of the line, characteristic of the action of light on blue print paper.
Sceptic No. 7 : The crystals found on the back cloth placed over the medium's knees
as mentioned on page 59 (21) prove trickery on her part.
Answer: Mrs. Deane would not consciously have put such a heap in so prominent a
place. A great number of my H and F results are produced with apported material;
in fact, all the brown marks of chapter VII, in the production of which it is obvious that
a liquid was used. The crystals are no exception otherwise than in the fact that they were
exposed by the operator, whoever or whatever he before being used. Of course, in the
absence of my other experiments stupidity on my part and duplicity on the part of the
medium are the simple explanation.
It looks as if the
0
operator.' for some reason or other wished me to see the crystals,
thinking nothing less obvious would bring the fact of his presence home to so dull-wittcd
a person as the experimenter, for immediately thereafter a little heap was put on the photo
graphic plate where it could not be overlooked.
Sceptic No. 8 : Suggested I dozed oIf during the H and F (chapter VII) experiments.
Answer: Certainly not. These were carried out in the morning. I had to be wide
awake and active to carry out four or ﬁve experiments at each sitting. My time, taken
from my business hours, was too valuable to me to waste it by falling asleep. Besides,
there are too many experiments recorded by me for such a suggestion to carry any weight.
