 This began in 1697 as a weather prognostication almanac for farmers put out by Francis Moore.  In 1700 for the year 1701, Moore shifted the emphasis to astrology under the titles Vox Stellarum: A Loyal Almanack, Old Moore: An Almanack, and Old Moore: An Ancient Almanac, Offering Astrological Forces and Determinants.  Various name changes over the years but the journal was always popularly referred to by some variant of Old Moore’s.  A monthly companion, Old Moore’s Monthly Messenger, was started in 1907.
