Observations.
We yst feem not
very well fatisfied,
and to fpeak truths
never (I fear) fhail>
fd long as party pre
vails. This is a
1, which we can-
not call upon the cae
leftial merTengers to
vindicate ! Reafori
and fage experience
have already con-
firrried it,in thebreaft
of every fenfibleman,
that whilft what de-
lights the one, dif-
tra6ts the other. Con-
fufion and difturb-
ance muft inevitably
follow 5 and peace
and harmony, love
and unity flee awdy.
Td fay that this is
the cafe with other
nations, is 'preading
the wound in (lead of
ing it ; and it is
but a furly fttisfac-
tion to (ay, I thank
God my caie is not
fo bad, but I fee as
much calamity in
that of my neigh
bour.

we may predict that
much bufinnefs is
upon the carpet ; fo
~ar any one, who has

vulgarly called

many vari-

not only private per-

their birth, age, and

alfo cities, kingdoms

deft and chriftian af-

the effrontery to at*

Of the Eclipses that will happen in the Year 1786,
TWICE will the filver Moon, the mother of months,
and foft emprefs of the night, loie her boriovved
luflre. Thrice will the blazing charioteer of day with-
draw his flaring beams for a while from the gazing fpec-
tator.
Within the rolling year mail five Eclipfes be,
Yet who inhabit here, not one of them mail fee.
The firit will be an invifible eclipfe of the Moon on
January 14, as follows
:
Beginning about 1 1 \ Mane.
Middle about 12 f Noon.
End almoft - 2 P. M.
But the Moon ooes not rife with us till after the eclipfe is
over.
The fecond is an eclipfe of the Sun, on the 30th of Ja-
nuary, at about 40 minutes paft 2 in the morn, and con-
fequently to us invifib.'t; but to thofe who are in 134
deg. Eaft longitude, and 32 deg. North latitude, he will
be centrally eclipfed.
The third will be a total eclrpfe of the Moon, as follows!
Beginning 8 h. 56 m. Mane, July nth.
Beginning of total darknefs, loh. 21m.
Middle of the eclipfe, - loh. 40m.
End of total darknefs - - nh, om.
End of the eclipfe - - - I2h. 24m.
To the inhabitants of the Britilh ifle it will however be
invifible.
The fourth is an invifible eclipfe of the Sun, on July 25,
near a quarter before 9 in the morning ; he will however
be centrally eclipfed in 42 deg. Eaft longitude, and 43
deg. South latitude.
The fifth and laft will be an eclipfe of the Sun, on Wed-
nesday, the 20th day of December, at above 3 quarters
pall 4 in the evening, and therefore to us not vifibie.
There will be alfo a tranfit of the planet Mercury over
the face of the Sun, on the morning of the 4th of May, as
follows
:
Beginning 15 min. paft 2 morning.
Middle - 57 min. pad 4
End - 38 min. palt 7.
Astrological Observations.
Qbfervations upon the probable Events during thefour Quar-
ters of the prefent Tear, and frf,
The Winter Quarter.
WHICH commenced on the 21ft of December, 1785,
at 3
quarters paft 8 in the morning,
When Sol to Capricorn purfued his way,
And dark'ning clouds almoft obfcure the day
;
When fnowy fleeces clothe the naked wood,
And freezing winds benumb the rapid flood;
The mighty torrent rages now no more,
But lays his fliff'ned arms befide the fhore.
To the curiousand more intelligent [ will give the fcheme
of the heavens, at the Sun's firft ingrefs into Capricorn ;
we have Luna in the earthy and temperate Virgo, and here
fhe hath her fall. The nimble Mercury is pofited in 19
deg. of the melancholy Capricorn, and herein he hath nei-
ther exaltation, detriment, nor fall. Venus in Sagittary
is under the fame predicament. The fiery Mars is retro-
gade in the 30th deg, of Taurus, wherein he has his de-
triment. Jupiter in the 6th deg. of the fiery Aries, where
he has neither dignity nor detriment. And Saturn in the
fame condition in Aquarius. And, now learned Reader,
judge for yourfelf.
What I have to add in this quarter is, that my obferva-
tions on the clofe of the preceding year may ftill continue
applicable; viz. much bufinefs itirring in the cabinet;
preparations againft hoftile defigns much talked of; among
the lower lort much wonder and ftrange things whifpered;
and, as is the natural confequence, Granger events ex-
pected. In relation to what effects this feafon will have
upon the human body ; true it is, the cold, moid, and de-
crepid age and ftate of man is mod confonant to this quar-
ter. Hence age fuffers moll:, and youth is moll healthful,
guc age, matured by experience, may fpin out life, while
youth, unguarded, lays a foundation for fudden death.
Of
Partridge, 1786.
Of the Spring Quarter,
^T7HICH this year commences on the 20th day of
VV March, at 29 minutes pad 10 in the morning, when
that glorious luminary the Sun once more deigns to dif-
penfe equal day and night, now once more touching upon
the cceleitial Aries. The pofition of the heavens at this
juncture will appear from the following fcheme
:
In this pofition of the heavens, wherein 9 deg. of Scor-
pio afcend, and 5 deg. of Pifces culminate, together with
the various afpedts of the prefent quarter, I think we may
venture to predict a very active time. We live in a day
when old ftates are difmembering, and new ones arifing.
Much faction is in many parts, and they who have read
the hiftory of ancient times will find, that what has been
will be, and there is no new thing under the fun. Em-
pires of old are now become void, and the hiftory of their
heroes and tranfactions appear to us as entirely fabulous.
But many will fay this cannot be the cafe with us in this
day, becaufe that their religion was a falfe one, and there-
fore, as ail national politics are founded upon the religion
of their country, their religion being a falfe foundation,
Astrological Observations. 43
their ftru&ure could no r
endure for ages. But we Chrif-
tians, whofe foundations are laid in the fure promifes of
the gofpel of truth, have greater hope? and higher expec-
tations frorn him who has faid, 1 o ! I will be with you al-
ways. But abfolutely this is either bad logic, or no logic
at all. For in the firft place, although religion is pretend-
ed to be the bafis of ail laws, yet it never appeared to me
that it was fo ; certain it is, that fome pretention of that
kind has at times gilded n any a bitter pill. —Thou lhak
not fuffer a witch to live, was a fcripture fentence, which
a century or two ago gave fanclion to a law by which a
harmlefs but helplefs old woman, when me could do no
more good, might re the more cruelly, becaufe legally,
deprived of life, to the great joy and fatisfa&ion of all the
good Chriftians, who kindly flood muttering their male-
dictions during her painful exit. Again, let us examine
the game laws, and being no fportfman myfelf, I claim a
greater right to fpeak to them. Thofe beafts of chace
which are confined to the pa ks of gentlemen, are certainly
as much their property as the lands they feed upon ; but
thofe who are free-booters upon every one, are certainly
the property of every one who can fecure them. I only
fay this, to prove that not every law is founded upon gof-
pel ; nor will I fay that in this cafe our lawgivers ever
went to the gofpel-mongers for a text. But one fwallow
makes no fu«nrner ; and it may probably be faid, that re-
ligion certainly is the firft eltablimer of laws, and at all
times the grand fupport of them. I acknowledge it, and
moil own that 1 fincerely believe it; and was I to make
a fiefh article of faith it would be a very fhort one, and
worded ! think in this manner:—No God, no faith —no
faith, no government-—no government, no laws-— and
no laws, no living. Yet in any country I muft needs fay,
that although the laws of the country lliould be built en-
tirely upon the divine code, yet if that be erroneous, the
other muft be fo like wife. Moreover, ancient cultom is fo
predominant over the populace, that prudence itfelf will
wink at it ; and I think I have excellent authority to back
my afferiion, when I call to mind the faying of St. Paul :
I am made ail things to all men, that I might by all means
win fome. But 1 muT rem nd you, that when I fpeak of
the divine code, I only mean (hat code of religious laws
and
44 Partridge, iyS6.
and tenets which are fuppofed to be the rules of particular
feds of Chriftians, through the reformed world. Let us
look into the Greek church, and fee what laws produced
from their religion would bring for the good of mankind.
All is not gold that glitters ; nor is, in my opinion, their
dilTention from the Rornifti church, a jot better than po-
pery. For a proof of this, I will give you an extract from
the Hiftory of the Travels of the AmbalTadors from the
Duke of Holftein, into Mufcovy, &c.
In fpeaking upon their modes and religious cuftoms, he
obferves thus: " Their burials, like their other public
actions, are performed with great ceremony ; for the foul
of the fick perfon is no fooner departed, than the widow
fends for their kindred and friends, who Handing round
the deceafed, alk him a number of iilly and impertinent
queftions, as, Why did he die? What had affronted him ?
Sec. Sec. Many more fuch fooleries pafs between his cieath
and interment. But I pafs over thefe, and only tell you
that at the laft, when he is taken to his grave in order to
ileep with his forefathers, the prieft then takes a paper,
which is a kind of ticket for his admiilion into Paradife,
and which being figned by the patriarch, or metropolitan
of the place, and the conierTor, is fold for more or lefs,
according to the abilities of the purchafer."—This ticket
is of fo extraordinary a nature, that the reader will not be
difoleafed at our inferring it at length from fo good au-
thority :
" We whofe names are hereunto fubferibed, the Patri-
arch, or Metropolitan, and Prieft of the city of N , do
make known and .certify by thefe prefents, that the bearer
of thefe our letters has always lived among us like a good
Chriftian, profeffing the Greek religion; and though he
hath committed fome few fins, yet he hath confefled the
fame, and thereupon hath received the communion for the
remiflion of his fin6; that he hath honoured God and his
faints; that he hath faid his prayers, and that he hath
failed on thehouis and days appointed by the church, and
that he hath carried himfelf (o well towards me, who am
his confe/Tor, that I have no reafon to complain of him,
or to deny him abfolution.

The coffin is then (hut and put into the grave, the face
being turned to the Eaft, while thofe who return to the
late houfe of mourning now drown their forrpws in liquor.
Now what good laws or pious documents can be expect-
ed from fo impure a fountain as this ? Again, let us look
into the part of the Chriftian world which is under the di-
rection of the church of Rome ; and hereto do impartial
jultice, I will give them fairly the words of one of their
beft and moft learned champions :
" Fides Catholica docet omnem virtutem efTe bonam,
omne vitium eiTe malum. Si autem erraret Papa, praeci-
piando vitia vel prohibendo virtutes, teneretur ecclefia
credere vitia elTe bona, et virtutes malas, nili vellet con-
tra conicientia peccare."
Bellarmine de Pontijice Romano, lib. 4, 5.
That my plain Proteftant reader may not be at a lofs,
through ignorance of the Latin language, I will give the
above a fair Englim. tranflation.
Bellarmine, in the 5th chapter cf the 4th book of the
forementioned book, fays thus: — "The Catholic faith
teaches us, that although every virtue is good, and every
vice evil, yet if the Pope mould fo far err as to command
vices, and prohibit virtues, the church is bound to believe
the vices to be good, and the virtues evil, unlefs he would
lin againft confcience."
The great, fenfible, and learned Dr. South, in his ob-
fervations upon thefe words, has this pertinent remark :
" Good God ! (faid he) that any thing that wears the
name of a Chriflian, or but of a man, fhouid venture to
own fuch a villainous, impudent, and blafphemous afTer-
tion in the face of the world as this. What ! mult mur-
der^ adultery, theft, fraud, extortion^ perjury, drunkennefs,
and all the horrible train of diabolical exercifes, pafs for
good and commendable actions, and fit to be pra&ifed ?
And mercy, chafiity ,
truth, jufice, temperance, and fincere
dealing, be accounted things utterly evil and immoral, and
not to be followed by men, in cafe the Pope, who is ge-
nerally a weak, and almoft always a wicked man, (hould
by his miftake and infallible ignorance, command the
former and forbid the latter ?
" Did
46 Partridce, 1786.
" Did Clin ft himfelf ever aflume fuch a power, as to
alter the morality of actions, aiU to transform vice into
virtue, or viftue into vice, by hi bare word ? Certainly
never did a grofler paradox, or a more wicked fentence,
drop from the mouth or pen of any moral man, fince rea-
fon or religion had any being in rhe world.
" And 1 muft confefs, I have ohen with great amaze-
ment wondered how it could pofiibly come from a perfon
of fo great reputation, both for learning and virtue too,
as the world allows Bellarmine to have been. But when
men give themfelves over to the defence of wicked inter-
efts, and falle proportions, it is but jull with God to fmite
the greater! abilities with the greateft infatuation."*-—
Thus far the learned and ingenious Dr. South.
We may methinks now planly difcover, that true reli-
gion is much mifufed, t ven to the fcandal of Chritlianity.
Upon fuch principles as I have been mentioning, what
code of human laws could be produced, which might be
faid to be eftablifhed upon the everlafting foundations of
gofpel truths. May we, who fit out of the (hadow of
darknefs, and enjoy the true light of the gofpel, with
hands and hearts lifted up to heaven, blefs the giver of
every good and peifedl gift, that the lines are fallen to us
in plealant places; yea, we have a goodiy heritage.
Again, we may hence learn that many modes of faith were
not founded upon fcripture, but were the offspring of the
human brain ; and then the fcriptures were ranfacked, and
often mifinterpreted for texts to maintain them. This is
another blefling that we Proteftants enjoy, that every man
may read and judge his own way. And fuppofi; g the
worft, viz. that (as the Papifts affirm) every heretic is cer-
tainly damned; yet the devil has poffelTed that Papift cer-
tainly, who will not give a poor Proteftant leave to go to
heli his own way; which the horrible Inquifition, and
the fire and faggots, together with the dire maflacres of
former ages, plainly prove they will not admit of. Laftlv,
Hence every Proteftant may learn, that not every nation
who profefles the Chriftian religion follows the true Chrif-
tian practice; from whence come ftrifes and dilTentions ?
have we not all one faith, one hope, one baptifm, one God
and Father of us all ? —J; comes from this \ we lull, and

have not ; nor are we ever eafy but when we are, for the
fake of intereft, deftroying one another.
But I proceed to the other two quarters, in which I fhall
be extremely brief.
The Summer Quarter.
/
THIS quarter begins at what time the Sun enters the
tropica] fign Cancer, which this year commences
on June the 21ft, at'8h. ~ in the morning. By all ap-
pearance, if we may be allowed to peep behind the cur-
tain, and give a modeft conjecture, this will be a bufy
quarter.—French counfels, Dutch honefly, and Hibernian
policy, are matters not much to be depended upon; dif-
fractions in councils of a free people are nothing new
;
witnefs the hiflory of ancient Rome, or indeed the annals
of our own nation. But I yet hope that the peaceable
well-wiftiers to the Britifh conftitution, may look forward
with fatisfadtion ; and thofe who have nothing elfe to hope
for, let them hope for a good harveft.
The Autumnal Quarter.
'HT^HIS quarter commences on the zzd day of Septem-
ker, at 10 in the evening, when the Sun entering
upon Libra, reduces days and nights again to an equality.
By the pofition of the heavens at this time, it Hill appears
to me that the year will continue in hurry and perplexity,
and poflibly, when it expires, leave the new one foie heir
to a wide fcene of confufion. If a revolt mould be ripe-
ning in Spanifli America, I fhould not much wonder; but
when it will take place, time, and not I, mull determine.
I heartily wifh our harveft plenteous, and well got in.
Complaints in fome parts I am well aware of, but i hope
not in general. May the labours of the feafaring be
crowned with fuecefs. Gladly would I promife happinefs
to every Hate of human exigence, but prudence fays, pro-
mife with caution.
And now, my good friends, the next page puts a pe-
riod to my this year's performance ; in which, if you was
to find any wit, I lhould be forry for it, I profefs it not

my talent; and if it was, I would make it an exile here,
as this is defigned, from the bottom of my heart, as a
fober, folemn, and, to the beft of my fmall abilities, fen-
fible account of what I really believed, in my contempla-
tions on the viciffitudes of the prefent year. Thofe who
are difatisfied that the piognoflics are not more full and
pointed, let them know, that under feven planets, and
twelve figns, are all the cities, countries, and dates in the
univerfe; and when the Aftrologer, although backed by
all the rules of his art, may predict an accident which
certainly fhall and does happen ; yet I have often found
it, to the truth as well as difcredit of Aftrology, that while
the Aftrologer's prefumption has marked out one place,
the finger of God has pointed out another, and time has
proved the event.
For this reafon I would rather be cautious than loqua-
cious. It was well faid of one of the antients, Sapius
revolve, quod femel evolverts, et verba cadenf in fententias t
Think twice before you fpeak once, and you will fpeak
twice the better for it. Let us therefore conclude with a
fervent prayer to him by whom kings reign, and princes
decree wifdom, to pour forth his bleflings upon our dread
Sovereign and all the royal family ; befeeching him, that
there may never be wanting one of that royal and truly
Proteftant line to fway the Britifh fcepter. And may he,
who rules the liars, make us holy here, in order that we
may be happy hereafter ; and to him be afcribed, as is
moft due, all honour, glory, dominion, and praife, hence-
forth and for evermore* Amen.
FINIS.
