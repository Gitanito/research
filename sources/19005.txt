well I enlisted in the night in the
United States Navy in August of 1978 and
I ended up on board the USS America
where unfortunately I sustained some
injuries on the flight deck while
performing my duties and and around
about way since that ended up at
cinclant fleet Atlantic command Support
Facility in Norfolk Virginia on Hampton
Boulevard and I was directly assigned to
LSF division 22 which were a group of
about eleven people then we were
directly responsible for briefing
Admiral train we briefed him on current
military operations around the world
what the Soviets were doing that day
what they had done the night before l
osf is just an acronym for Atlantic
Operational Support Facility and
cinclant fleet is another acronym for
commander-in-chief atlantic fleet which
admiral train was at the time everyone
on the eastern seaboard answered to this
man
I was branded after a six-month wait a
top-secret special compartment at
intelligence clearance with the zebra
stripe identification badge which
permitted access to all facilities on
the base at all times
I had unrestricted access to any
facility at any time as well as the
command center of which it was
specifically granted for so that I could
be up on the mezzanine or the third deck
as we called it opposed the command
center to make sure that any ingoing
incoming and outgoing audio/video
information that came into the command
center was recorded and duly logged for
reference or if they needed it for later
we&#39;re recording every other video and
audio of everything that&#39;s going on even
when they set what was called a
condition zebra alert which was
generally a training exercise they would
announce it beforehand this is a drill
this is a drill set conditions equal and
unauthorized personnel would be escorted
out of the command center it&#39;s the
highest level of alert that the Navy has
or had at that time for dealing with a
generally for generally dealing with
global nuclear threats in particular the
Soviets Soviet Bearcats would routinely
patrol up and down the eastern seaboard
watching what we were doing and we would
set a condition zebra if we had the need
to put planes in the air to escort the
Bearcats if they were a little close too
close to our airspace or if they had
ships in the area that were being a
little suspicious acting for instance or
they would have a a drill for instance
where they would get at the mad books
they called them the watch officer and
the junior watch officer the Jo they had
keys to a safe and they would get these
books out of the mat book
mutual assured destruction and they
would have the codes that were necessary
transmitted to the submarines out in the
watching stations to if necessary to
launch a nuclear strike and not many
people were allowed in the command
center because they actually did use the
codes and so forth that I&#39;m sure the
Soviets and any other persons who were
enemies the United States would have
looked who got their hands on the zebra
classification without that you were not
allowed
access to these facilities during this
distri land as the zebra drill was
specifically for the highest level of
top-secret information that was being
exchanged between the command center and
ships and/or submarines at see whether
they started out pretty routine had
gotten a cup of coffee it was early in
the summer and I&#39;d say around the first
week or two in May to the best of my
knowledge so everything was going along
pretty just ho-hum routine and they
dimmed the lights first in the command
center when they said a condition zebra
alert always dim the lights first it
turned the lights down and most of the
times when they set these drills they
would say this is a drill this is a
drill set conditions April and but they
turned the lights down this time and
they didn&#39;t say this is a drill and the
watch officer in the Junior watch
officer looked at each other and says
you know world told them some of their
assistants to verify whether or not this
was a drill as the event was taking
place and our early warning system off
the I would think I believe it came in
from Air Force Base in Greenland at that
time to the best of my knowledge or
perhaps an early warning station up as
far as Nova Scotia that we had
contact with an unidentified flying
object that it entered our airspace and
they said that this was not a drill and
so it was treated with the utmost
promptness and everyone started just you
know running around like mad you know
once they realized it wasn&#39;t a drill and
it took on a whole different air and
within moments of that the watch officer
someone to Admiral train over to the
command center because this was a little
out of his area of authorization for
lack of a better way to put it it
required Admiral trains oversight and
within minutes Admiral train was rushed
into the command center into his viewing
booth that he had right under the
mezzanine there and the first thing that
Admiral train wanted to know was how
many contacts we had where they were
which direction were they going and were
the Soviets responding because we knew
it wasn&#39;t the Soviets that had entered
our airspace that was verified from the
get-go and very start and at that point
when Admiral train found out that the it
wasn&#39;t the Soviets and that he wanted to
know what the Soviets responding to this
threat also that was the end moment that
he gave authorization to put two planes
up to go see what this thing was and
that&#39;s when it all the chasing up and
down you know began we launched planes
from his foreign north his Greenland to
Odin NES Oceana and this object we had
it on radar for oh this event probably
lasted uh oh gosh almost an hour perhaps
and pilots you could hear the pilots
live voice transmissions being piped
into the command center visual
confirmation and object description of
the objects pilots were able to close a
couple of times and be able to see that
the the object was not a an aircraft
that we were familiar with was nothing
that we had was nothing the Soviets had
and that was determined very quickly and
this this vehicle that more playing or
whatever it was they were chasing uh so
very erratic flight up and down the
coast very quick flight it would
actually be off the coast of Maine for
instance and would leave airspace in
that area so quickly that we were having
to have planes coming out of Dover Air
Force Base to pick it up just in what
seemed like moments and we take well I
know for a fact it would take you know
now fourteen probably thirty minutes to
traverse that much distance participant
was was just popping up just you know
one minute it was here the next minute
BAM it was down you know several hundred
miles you know down the coast just
playing tag it did go all the way down
to a point off the coast of Florida
around Mayport the Naval Air Station we
have down there at Cecil field or had at
that time I think it&#39;s closed now and
that was before it turned and took well
it would have been in easterly direction
from our vantage point back out towards
the Azores before we actually lost track
of it and during all this we have
satellites called the kh-11 satellites
that we use for information gathering
and this satellite does have a did have
a very high capability of taking really
good photographs of things literally
within just a few feet of the ground
from a vantage point out in outer space
and they were trying to get the cage 11
satellite to track this thing to get
some photographs of it and they didn&#39;t
the the satellite the photographs that
we did get back into the command center
later on came from mom the first
encounters that the planes had with it
about the North American coast they did
get close enough to get some some
photographs taken that were later
brought over to the
to the command center welcomed the
photograph I could remember the shape
but I would have said would have been
more like a well it was it was quite
flat it was long I would say I would say
a cylinder I would say a cylinder
because it was abrupt
it had abrupt ends they didn&#39;t take the
ends didn&#39;t take her down like most
aircraft it just came to an abrupt end
and it did appear to be reflecting
sunlight because you can clearly tell it
was metallic or appeared to be clearly
metallic and the pilots they were giving
information such as it was not even it
was not leaving behind a vapor trail no
discernible lights markings on it the
windows cockpit windows doors nothing
like that it seemed to be just one solid
thing whatever it was what was really
bugging doctor
Admiral training out I&#39;m sorry that was
what was really driving him nuts was
this thing absolutely had complete
control of the situation and could just
be wherever it wanted to be just in a
matter of seconds one minute we are you
know closing on it you know off the
coast of Maine the next minute it&#39;s in
Norfolk headed south towards Florida and
it&#39;s all we can do to alert the get the
early warning radar up down the coast to
you know watch this thing as it just had
it stay with us just toying with us son
you know lack of a better way to put it
and and add more training his staff or
they were quite concerned about it to
say the least
they were quite concerned especially
once they found out that it wasn&#39;t the
Russians and it wasn&#39;t us and he wasn&#39;t
aware of anyone else who had the
technology to build such a craft that
could whatever it was could move about
so easily
and so quickly and I remember distinctly
looking over the the rail over the
mezzanine there over the third deck and
just watching complete chaos you know
break out the cause of their inability
to keep a truck you know to keep an eye
on this thing whatever it was then yeah
the thing was moving around so
erratically and so quickly up and down
the coast they were trying to notify as
many commands as they could up and down
the coast to track this thing or get a
plane up as Admiral train was doing he
was scrambling authorizing planes up
just left and right up and down the
whole eastern seaboard and to try and
cut this thing off you know to to get
some planes coming in on from the north
and the south for instance to kind of
welter literally traffic you know to to
force it down it was clear that they
wanted it they wanted to recover it to
force it down on by whatever means
possible
the order was given by Admiral trained
to try and get this object forced down
out of the sky if at all possible by
whatever means possible and that was as
I had said before after they found out
anew for certainty that it wasn&#39;t the
Russians and after that we found that it
wasn&#39;t the Russians they didn&#39;t care who
it was as long as it wasn&#39;t the Russians
they didn&#39;t care who it was or where it
was from they wanted it and wanted it
bad the information coming in command
center was being relayed to us from
different radar sites that we have up
and down the sea you know Eastern coasts
that watch our airspace the only
descriptions that I recall that the
pilots actually made were that they
could not find any markings on the
aircraft they could not find any visible
signs that the thing have wings a tail
windows a cockpit or anything like that
or any markings from any country I would
describe him as being scared yeah you
know yeah scared to put it in a nutshell
yeah he was usually a very calm man of
you know very mild demeanor just really
nice fella and you did never really seem
lose control raise his voice get excited
about anything but this really got
really got him really had him upset to
say the least and that was I&#39;d say that
was the impression that I had for most
of the officers that was and they were
just they were just as much in the dark
and scared as everybody they would not
actually track it down the coast he
would just appear hundreds of miles from
its last sighting and the pilots were
that it was just one moment it was there
and the next moment it wasn&#39;t and I
think that was one of the things that
really had add more trains hackles up
because
cause he didn&#39;t have any control over it
or the situation this thing just had a
mind of its own and was causing such an
uproar up and down the eastern coast and
him being ultimately responsible at that
time I&#39;m sure it was I&#39;m sure it was
stressing him out quite a great great
deal which you could tell by his tone of
voice you could just tell you know by
listening to him that he was he was very
very very worried but on radar it was
very unusual that the radar information
that was coming in to us that we were
keeping track of was they would
absolutely lose lose it
one moment and then we would pick it up
they would just appear in as an
unauthorized vehicle in in military
airspace for example and trust me the
military knows where every commercial
flight is at all times they knew we knew
where every plane we had was at all
times we knew where every commercial
flight coming through our airspace was
at all times but there just wasn&#39;t
anything going on that we didn&#39;t know
about it literally it wasn&#39;t anything
going on that we didn&#39;t know about all
the planes that were scrambled they will
put up off of shore facilities because
the Navy has short facilities you know
the Naval Air Station for example Oceana
when you set a condition zebra whether
to drill or not people who are not
authorized to be there who don&#39;t who do
not have a zebra access badge it&#39;s a
zebra stripe badge on your clearance
patch they have to leave the command
facility and we have Marines stationed
outside the building there we in the
building and as well as outside that
were under orders to shoot any author
unauthorized personnel that remained in
the command center during one of these
episodes and that was in supposedly for
interest of national security there&#39;s a
door right here and this guy the marine
comes in and wants to know what&#39;s going
on is this a drill or so forth heating
and they&#39;ve got orders to start shooting
people and I know because I actually got
the junior roadies attention and said
hey you guys need to tell this guy
something he&#39;s ready to start shooting
people
you know because they haven&#39;t told him
to stand down yet and and which he did
and I remember you know wanting to just
get the hell out of there you know
because they were well he came in and
you know and if he said if you&#39;ve got a
minute or two if I don&#39;t find out
something oh they were ready to come in
start shooting people yeah you know
destroying evidence and no yeah on this
event as as I refer to it ended the
object that we were had been chasing up
and down the seaboard and not really
getting a whole hell of a lot of
information from and just playing you
know tag with this thing
it headed out towards over the Atlantic
towards the Azores and I don&#39;t know who
was responsible for getting this
information who actually had it or how
they have you actually gotten it but I
do remember them saying that it had
pulled up at a 66 degree angle when it
opposed as it approached Azores like
this and it just pulled up in a 66
degree angle without slowing down or
anything and left the active atmosphere
just was gone he just took off into
space and was gone and just like that
and I mean it just absolutely left I
mean you&#39;re talking about something that
covered thousands of miles in the blink
of an eye and it was just gone and it
just left everyone sitting around
scratching their heads you know she was
woman with that was it was comical in a
way to see how the vast military might
of the United States being put on its
knees by something they had no idea what
it was where it came from
where it was going or anything I mean
and the only thing that they knew for
sure was it wasn&#39;t the Soviets and they
were very adamant about finding that out
whether or not was something new the
Soviets came up with we secured from
condition zebra they turned the lights
up you know everyone is sitting around
talking about it you know downs of
command floor I&#39;m up here by myself on
the third deck
I had more trainings down here in his
briefing area
they stayed for a few minutes before
they left and everyone&#39;s just you know
making idle chitchat about it and so
forth and so on
I made a law governing a note of it in
my logbook like you had to do and really
didn&#39;t give it much more thought these
two guys came in in suits they weren&#39;t
in military uniform they just came in in
suits and you know had two little badges
on they didn&#39;t have zebra-striped
clearances it was like a visitor&#39;s badge
they didn&#39;t they weren&#39;t per you could
tell they weren&#39;t personnel there and I
didn&#39;t know him Tom dick from Harry I&#39;d
never seen these guys before so we go
out of duties in 2010 we go downstairs
to the first floor and there&#39;s there are
several little conference rooms and so
forth and they took me into one they
already had set up and set me down and
they had my logbook neither they got
that and took it down with me and and
these two gentleman became began to
aquestion me about this event and I
remember you know saying to them they
were they were being pretty rough you
know about it to be honest with you and
I remember telling them literally
putting my hands up and going wait a
minute fellas I&#39;m on your side
you know whoa just a minute because they
were they were not being they were not
really nice they were very intimidating
and made it quite clear to the point
that nothing that was seen heard or
witnessed that transpired during that
was to leave this building you not to
say a word to it but to it about your
co-workers and off base you just forget
everything you may have seen her or
whatever concerned with this it didn&#39;t
happen but they were nice nasty I guess
it&#39;s a good way to put it and I
distinctly remember sitting back to my
chair and I put my hands up and had to
tell these guys wait a minute hey we&#39;re
on the same side fellas you know we
don&#39;t have a problem here
because you got the you got the
impression that they would do bodily
harm to you otherwise I mean without
really coming out and threatening their
tone of voice well you can just tell you
know someone&#39;s you know letting you know
hey buddy do you know
do what I say where else if this object
had been hostile and wanted to drop
weapons or shoot missiles at us or
whatever oh they they would have been
read it would have been a very easy for
them to do that there was no question
about that
and I&#39;m not a pilot we don&#39;t have
anything or didn&#39;t have anything at that
time that could hold a candle to
whatever this was and it was just had
its own free run of the of our airspace
and could do anything it wanted as far
as traveling at wheel we did not pose
any threat to it whatsoever that was
painfully painfully obvious very very
much so I do believe that Admiral
training knew that too and was quite
afraid that that just might this might
happen yeah because you&#39;re just in a
word I&#39;d say that that old war was
scared just playing old scared put
having all the 35 millimeter slides that
we had we never got around to putting
them up on the telus on for Admiral
train to actually view they were just
prepared at her I can remember her
telling me that they came in got up all
the film and you know developed and
undeveloped and all the materials they
had with it in the slides my logbook I
never did see that again I know we had a
new logbook the next day a brand
spanking new and start with and that
disappeared and I don&#39;t know what
happened to it nobody really knew what
happened to it she said the guys same
guys came in that took me downstairs
that same day they had already been over
there to her lab she was asking me what
happened she said you know what was
going on what happened you know she said
these two guys came in here read us the
riot act and wanted you know on this
that any other and rounded up all this
stuff and it went down as just an
unidentified flying object
we never they never didn&#39;t know what it
was they never did that was what they
just logged it off literally as an
unidentified flying object
literally I remember the watch officer
and the jod
in the OD officer of the day and the
June officer day I do remember them
looking at each other talking I&#39;m just
hanging my head over listening you know
they&#39;re talking to each other about how
to put it in their log books you know
what you know how we&#39;re going to do this
he just said put it down
unidentified flying object contact
that&#39;s you know whether they were
whether they got the same third degrees
I did from these other two guys I would
think so
I would think everybody was in the
command center got it I would say that
the facilities that actually had this
thing on radar five that I&#39;m sure and
that&#39;s from Greenland all the way to
Florida five that I&#39;m sure of now there
may be of some others but I don&#39;t know
but Yahoo worth that&#39;s because I knew
that because Admiral train was giving
orders to see if you know any a s Oceana
you know let&#39;s get some planes up from
there come with some fighters he did
make a call for them to alert Dover Air
Force Base Patuxent River Maryland
Cecil field and in Florida when I got
out I received a an official United
States Navy document on the Navy
letterhead they gave me this document
where for five years I was absolutely
out of the question
I could not leave the country under any
circumstances whatsoever and to leave
the state of Virginia I had to contact
the Roanoke office of the FBI and let
them know if I just wanted to cross the
state line down here to go into North
Carolina or or just leave the state of
Virginia I had to let the FBI know but
that was four five years after I was
discharged I was going to tell you about
this guy Jack booth is his name he&#39;s
dead now but he was in the army and he
was stationed at Roswell when the
Roswell incident happened and it&#39;s my
wife&#39;s uncle
my wife&#39;s mother&#39;s brother there were a
bunch of these kids he was from
Bluefield West Virginia his name was
Jack booth and that he said that when he
was in the Army just a kid
in the army he was at Roswell when this
thing whatever it was crashed and he
said that it was he was there putting
guard duty when they went out to the
crash site on a truckload of them to get
debris up and whatnot and
that he was there when they actually did
recover the bodies and he was standing
there he said I&#39;m telling you he said
they&#39;d put a little bit of guys in body
bags and he said they weren&#39;t humans he
said they were just little odd-looking
fellows you know he said they weren&#39;t
nothing like a human and they put him in
body bags and one or two of them were
still conscious or alive or something
like that from the crash there were
survivors there were actual survivors
from this crash according to him now I
just remember him just saying they were
just a little bitty you know non-human
beings I don&#39;t remember if he said how
tall they were they were picking up all
the little pieces and he said they
actually put them guys down shoulder to
shoulder on their hands and knees and
went across the debris area picking up
any little speck and scrap of anything
that they had and they&#39;ve done it for
days you know for days and that they
were all threatened he said they just
came right out and said you know look
you see anything about this and you
might just turn up missing tomorrow but
he did say that that they were you know
they didn&#39;t you know make any bones
about it came right to the point about
letting them know that how long you know
much they wanted to keep this you know
under wraps but he said I&#39;m telling you
he said I was there this would have been
uh 1979 maybe 1980 yeah
John Michael Murphy is a Marine Corps
corporal when I was in the Navy he was
stationed down at the Security barracks
at Sinclair fleet was part of the
security detail there for the base and
Murphy had support them down that
earlier when he was over in students
rank or that he had guarded actually
guarded a space ship an extraterrestrial
craft or whatever you want to call it at
a facility not far from Dover Air Force
Base over in Delaware and
no one Murphy&#39;s idea yeah I believe it
was kind of grass for like maybe eight
to ten inches long I can&#39;t remember
it seemed giant like when I saw it
because it was the first time I&#39;d ever
seen anything like this before
and all eyes were just peeled on that
particular thing and when he told us
what it was it was Frank
