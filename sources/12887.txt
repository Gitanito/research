I fell down an empty stairwell backwards.  I landed over the lower corner of floor, did a flip, and hit my head on a brick. I was unconscious, but don't know how long.

When I knew nothing was under foot, I jumped out of my body, stayed on top, and watched the body at the bottom of stairwell.  Then I went down and watched laborers and carpenters run up to me and stand around talking about me.  A bricklayer pushed me on the shoulder, and I jumped back in my body.   I was lying face down facing away, and could have not seen this with my eyes.

I am still half out of body, and people sense this, although they do not know what it is, and they fear it!
