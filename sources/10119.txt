Then there was an extraordinary bright (white) light. Very, very, bright. Then it started to change to a beautiful blue. An indescribable blue. Then suddenly I was back. The doctors had to shock me back to life. The first thing the nurse to my left said to me was did I see the light. When I came back, I was very emotional and crying. I didn't even know what had happened. They had to remind me where I was and why I was there. The word children was in my head right away and I couldn't stop thinking about the word children for weeks. I was also depressed. When I was at home recovering, my dreams at night were about angels. I was really seeing them a lot in my dreams when I slept. The experience put questions toward my beliefs.
