 The note on this journal in Notes and Queries says that it was "replete with dream lore and personal experiences," but it was more ambitious than that in its efforts and displayed an impressive learning in the classical and Renaissance works on dreams and a familiarity with the then current mesmeric thought on the subject of the mind and the "Night Side of Nature," culminating in Monroe's "Rules of Interpretation."  Monroe (1822-1901) was a coal miner and dealer in Peoria but displays learning that many small towns in the United States could boast of before such things were concentrated in the cities.  He was apparently not dogmatic in his interpretations of the meanings of dreams and regularly corrected in later issues what he had written earlier.  The journal contained poems by Lizzie Doten, regular articles by W.H. Chaney (on Astrology and on "Spirit Materialization" -- an illusion produced in the minds of observers by spirit power) and La Roy Sunderland, excerpts from J.C. Spurzheim, parts of Alexander Wilder's translation of Iamblichus's On the Mysteries, etc., an examination of the condition of Mollie Fancher and of her visions, and numerous accounts of dream experience and interpretation.  Monroe also wrote Monroe's Interpreter and Translator, Addressed to the Riddles of Scriptural Prophecy, and The Dreamer's Teacher and Oneirocritica, Consisting of Definitions of Dreams, and Vision Symbols, Demonstrations, Applications, Experience in All Ages; Interpretations, Ancient and Modern (J.W. Franks & Sons, Peoria, IL, 1887).
