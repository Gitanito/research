I saw a bright light through a tunnel, I went to the light; as I was going to the light I saw tiny lights all around me. I remember feeling at peace and the feeling of floating. I think someone said something to me and I said (I told Fess I would be fine) Fess is my son at the time he was seven years old. I could not lie to him. The feeling of being pulled back into my shell with the feeling of heaviness (like I was weighted down) Then I woke up in the intensive care unit fighting for air.
