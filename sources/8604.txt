                  The Texas Book Of The Dead offers insight into several questions that   	most of us have asked ourselves throughout the course of our life. Questions   	like: Does the soul live on after bodily death?&nbsp; If so, what is the nature   	of the afterlife? If heaven is so nice, why do we fight so hard to stay in   	our earthly body?&nbsp; And, what evidence supports the answers to these   	questions?&nbsp; Man   	has always pondered what the afterlife is like.&nbsp; The ancient Egyptians wrote   	what has come down to us as the EGYPTIAN BOOK OF THE DEAD.&nbsp; The Tibetans   	wrote THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD.&nbsp; Now author Dick Browning has compiled a   	consensus of&nbsp;modern reports from the other side and titled it, THE TEXAS   	BOOK OF THE DEAD.

  	&nbsp;

Have   	you ever been paralyzed with fear of &quot;something&quot; in the darkness of your   	room but you just couldn't get the courage to turn on the light and look at   	it? Sounds silly and irrational, doesn't it? We have, however, all had this   	experience at some time in our life. By writing The Texas Book of the Dead,   	Dick Browning may have just gotten up and turned on that light for those of   	us who have a dreadful dark fear of death and dying and are afraid to look   	at it. He gives us a collection of the personal stories of many ordinary   	people just like ourselves who have had experiences that many of us would   	see as extraordinary because they demonstrate an accessible relationship   	between those of us still living a physical existence in a human body and   	those we know to have passed out of their human body...what we call death.   	We face this &quot;death&quot; all around us every day whether it is the passing of a   	beloved family member, friend, or just watching a TV program depicting human   	death. Much of the fear, pain, and guilt that we live with regarding death   	could be alleviated if we could just look at this &quot;event&quot; with a new and   	healthier perspective. The Texas Book of the Dead is a quick read which   	addresses many of our questions about life, death, and dying. Perhaps it can   	turn on a little light for you and take away the paralyzing fear that keeps   	you from fully living your life now because of your fears surrounding death   	and dying. Presented with respect, humor, and insight, this little book   	gives one confirmation that life goes on, and death is just a change that we   	can live with.
