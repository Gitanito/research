although everyone hope everyone can hear
and see me I&#39;m here out at my house in
the Blue Ridge Mountain on dr. Steven
Greer and I&#39;m here with Jim Martin who&#39;s
vice president of 1091 previously the
orchard that&#39;s distributing Close
Encounters of the fifteen and we&#39;re
gonna have a conversation about a number
of things for an hour or two depending
on just how long we want to go so thank
all of you for joining and I want to
thank the Moriarty&#39;s for helping you set
this up so hopefully everyone can hear
me they&#39;re training this old dog to do
some new tricks with all this fancy
schmancy stuff I&#39;ve got here but
hopefully it&#39;s working huh okay you so
do you
so I&#39;m here in near Charlottesville
Virginia on in the country I&#39;m on a 65
acre farm so I always joked people
asking about coronavirus I said well
we&#39;re always socially distanced out here
this is the nearest place is half a mile
away but we&#39;re here with our - my wife
and I are here with our two rescue dogs
Rosie and chase one is F pitbull and
half lab that we rescued and the other
was is half we don&#39;t know what border
collie and lab and I&#39;m gonna do a little
PSA always rescue a dog never purchased
one thank you so so I love dogs so we&#39;re
really gonna cover some interesting
things today I have some show-and-tell
so one thing just as a programming note
for folks later on as we get into this
I&#39;m gonna show people send this out for
your your social media right now I&#39;m
going to show something very very cool
that I got from a man who has since
deceased who was the senior scientists
at the Naval Research Lab and he had a
meeting with an an actual
extraterrestrial who drew for him some
kind of geometric form that&#39;s part of
energy and propulsion system I have the
3d version of it that took them years
the computer generate their only I don&#39;t
know if there any left in the world but
I&#39;m going to show you guys that because
it&#39;s so beautiful and so cool and then a
couple another couple of fun things but
first I think we&#39;re gonna start with an
update about the pandemic and kind of go
into some sort of practical things since
I&#39;m an emergency doctor so that you
folks have a sense of really what you
ought to be doing obviously they&#39;re
asking all of us for self isolate and
socially distance means six feet or more
apart it doesn&#39;t mean that you have to
be under house arrest it means that you
if you&#39;re out biking hiking running
whatever that you&#39;re just a reasonable
distance away from people and pick
routes where there aren&#39;t a lot of folks
if you can if you&#39;re been a Manhattan
that&#39;s probably harder to do but
certainly in a lot of cities are they&#39;re
more remote places the hand washing is
still important and the sanitization of
the pandemic is probably going to go on
for perhaps a year if we don&#39;t get a
vaccine because they&#39;re estimating 60%
of all of us will get it at some point
but let me tell you what that means it
means that there is a 60% chance for the
population as a whole to get it so let&#39;s
say in America we have three hundred and
forty million people you can do the math
0.6 times 340 is around 190 some or 200
million of what they&#39;re trying to do
with this social separation is to be
sure not because it&#39;s so contagious it&#39;s
about two or three times as contagious
as the flu which they just don&#39;t want
everyone to get it all at once because
if they do our systems for the
healthcare system which has not been set
up for something like this will be so
over on that people who are critically
ill won&#39;t be able to get help in time to
save them with a ventilator so that&#39;s
what the socially distancing is about
it&#39;s that they used a term blunting to
curve it&#39;s not it&#39;s actually stretching
out the period it&#39;s very unlikely that a
vaccine will be around in time for it
not to eventually go through this you
know to society everyone can hope they
don&#39;t get it but if you live a normal
life you may now getting back to this
statistic as Mark Twain said and I love
the quote there are liars adamm liars
and statistics and and the reason he
sort of the wag that he was said that is
where you can do anything with a
statistic but let me tell you as a
doctor what that means it means in an
entire population there&#39;s a 60% chance
you people will get it in general it
doesn&#39;t address you so let&#39;s say you&#39;re
not someone who is you&#39;re retired you&#39;re
not going to rock concerts
you&#39;re not going to big events or you&#39;re
some people live as virtual shut-ins
they&#39;re risk it&#39;s much lower than some
would say myself who&#39;s one planes all
the time in massive crowds all the time
hanging out with people and crowded
venues and conferences and lectures all
the time where the likelihood of someone
like me I think isn&#39;t sixty percent it&#39;s
probably 90 plus percent so part of what
you have to do is assess a couple things
and this is where you get into you&#39;re
gonna see the whole science doctor thing
going here you&#39;ve got to think what are
my what is my lifestyle but also on top
of that what is my state of health so if
you have a general poor state of health
for whatever reason maybe you&#39;ve had
cancer and chemotherapy maybe you know
you have some underlying diseases maybe
you&#39;re a cigarette smoker which is an
enormous risk factor for this but
they&#39;re not talking about that all has
to get factored into your own assessment
of your risk because none of us are
statistic all of us are individual human
beings so that&#39;s where I&#39;m trying to
make this meaningful where you tend to
take the
formation and do your own assessment
risk risk assessment
depending on how you live where you live
if you&#39;re in a hot zone like New York or
you know what your state of general
health is and then what can you do about
your general state of health we
mentioned I&#39;m a little bit read someone
mentioned list I&#39;ve been trying to go
out in the Sun when we have the person
in the mountains of the Blue Ridge here
you if you have two sunny days in a row
you&#39;re dancing the Kasatka
you know you&#39;re excited and then but you
know I try to get out because you have a
much better conversion of and creation
in your body from natural sunlight for
20 minutes or something hitting your
body then taking a pill the pills you
take for vitamin D which are found to be
helpful for not only your immune system
but also preventing heart disease
adequate vitamin D levels are important
and stadion off colon cancer very
specifically they found that people who
live in far northern climes that are
never out in the Sun have a much higher
rate of colon cancer and some of these
other diseases then people in sunnier
areas so but the conversion of different
sunlight hitting your skin to vitamin D
is the most effective much more so than
a pill most of which is excreted quite
frankly and not absorbed and utilized so
you know you don&#39;t want to get sun
cancer you know you don&#39;t get cancer
from the skin and Sun but there&#39;s
nothing wrong with being out getting a
reasonable meson and I remember reading
about how Yogananda Paramahansa talked
about how full body spectrum of the
light of the Sun what he would call it
Sun bath for like 15-20 minutes was very
very good for the mine and the body
together whereas being shut in into an
apartment or shut in someplace never
seen the light of day is bad for you
physically and mentally so I&#39;m a big
advocate of nature and the outdoors and
a reasonable use of being out in the Sun
obviously if you&#39;re gonna be out for
prom here is use sunscreen and all that
but for a little while you don&#39;t need
much you don&#39;t need much full-body
exposure to get good vitamin D and
vitamin C it&#39;s not gonna hurt you to
take large amounts of vitamin C but
here&#39;s a caveat mine routine not that
it&#39;s anyone&#39;s business but why not we&#39;re
here in my living room is that I get up
and I have only thing I have in the
morning is water orange juice and a
whole fresh orange why because and I&#39;ll
take a vitamin C and also zinc zinc is
very important in fighting viruses and
infection because it helps the immune
system fight off you need zinc for your
immune system and and even more though
for males for reasons that I won&#39;t go
into on a public streaming setting but
you can guess so it&#39;s very important so
I will take that but I&#39;ll take it with
the G orange juice and the orange
because there are cofactors they&#39;re
called in the natural substances that
are not in your vitamins that you need
so popping pills absent of a healthy
diet is not gonna be as effective as
combining exercise with sunlight with
some vitamin supplements but also a diet
were you&#39;re good fresh diet where you&#39;re
getting the cofactors that enable those
vitamins to work because they don&#39;t work
by themselves they work with a whole lot
of other things needing to be there with
them so a lot of people who think oh I&#39;m
gonna be healthy I&#39;m just gonna pop
every kind of pill they&#39;re actually not
they&#39;re not getting much benefit from
that they&#39;re spending a lot of money but
they&#39;re not getting the benefit so you
know I was the founder of in when I was
in Asheville North Carolina of the
Shambala Institute which was a holistic
health and healing center I did this in
my laughs now spare time as an emergency
doctor racing for children but it was
before I did all the things with C sette
and what-have-you but I would teach
people about this was most people don&#39;t
know that they&#39;re happy to go to a
natural food store
wherever and get a bunch of pills but
they don&#39;t know that those pills aren&#39;t
gonna be very effective if you don&#39;t
also do these other things that involve
your diet your exercise and what we&#39;re
going to get into in a little bit here
is that the power of the mind for
healing and the power of the mind for
the immune system being augmented and
and improved so that&#39;s really important
now on the pandemic itself of course
you&#39;ve heard that the United States is
now number one in the world for a number
of cases even though China has four
times the population of ours and a great
deal of that has to do with we are three
months late unfortunately standing up
our testing capability and therefore
being able to smartly contain it because
without testing you don&#39;t know where the
next hot zone is because there&#39;s a lag
time from the time that it&#39;s sort of in
the community with people having minimal
symptoms to the point where it&#39;s surges
on that big arc up like that so the
because of the time lag from the time of
exposure to symptoms and severe symptoms
and we didn&#39;t do any testing beginning
in in January February what-have-you
we&#39;re so far behind the curve or
probably two three months behind the
wave and that&#39;s just a complete failure
of our public health and governmental
systems at the United States there&#39;s no
other way to put up you can&#39;t put you
know lipstick on a pig that&#39;s just the
truth
so we are we are we do not have is my
editorial comment for the day may be my
only one we don&#39;t really have a health
care system we have a health profit
centered industry and I say this as an
emergency doctor because we&#39;re I was in
a big public hospital frontline you know
all the all the fun stuff shootings and
stabbings and car wrecks and burns and
massive heart attacks and could lose
four people in cardiac arrest and all
that stuff but what I told
people is that we have to understand
that over the last 20 years or so it&#39;s
become more and more oriented toward
squeezing every drop of efficiency
maximizing efficiency and squeezing out
any excess capability now what does that
mean let&#39;s take New York State for
example in the last couple decades
they&#39;ve lost 20,000 hospital beds just
because they&#39;ve closed down to make
hospitals more profitable the system
were profitable for this for the
stakeholders whether it be whoever it is
so this is a peculiar and unfortunate
situation in America that we all have to
acknowledge we&#39;re not going to change
that tomorrow we may need to change that
going forward down the road simply
because we also don&#39;t have we have
what&#39;s just-in-time
supply chains now let me explain what
that means so if you&#39;re like a
manufacturer of widgets little devices
you it used to be you would have
warehouses full of the parts you would
need and say and stock them up they
found they could make more profit if
they didn&#39;t have to store a lot of
things but they had an ordering system
that was digitized and computerized or
things arise right every single day just
as you need it it cut down a warehouse
space a Tyne up of money and inventory
on and on and on and from a
manufacturing point of view you can&#39;t
argue with the economics of that however
when you&#39;re talking about healthcare and
a medical catastrophe of hand emic or
some other thing a massive earthquake
that would hit California or some other
place or what have you that&#39;s a very bad
policy it&#39;s it makes more money for the
healthcare corporate you know money
that&#39;s really who runs our system our
system is not run in the interest of the
people and the public it&#39;s or the
doctors or the nurses who are now dying
because of this trying to take care of
people it&#39;s run for the benefit of the
corporate Four
profit stakeholders that&#39;s not a
political statement it&#39;s a statement of
fact and that&#39;s why for example
Switzerland which is hardly a developing
country it&#39;s not you know the Congo
spends fifty percent on the dollar half
as much as America does per person in
health care and have better outcomes and
a better system so we&#39;re paying twice as
much as Switzerland and have worse
outcomes and have no capabilities but
that&#39;s because it&#39;s all it would be it
is an oriented towards you and Meany or
me as a doctor and you as a patient
having the best situation is oriented
toward squeezing the maximum amount of
money from people who care about one
thing the almighty dollar so that you
have to understand that that is if
you&#39;re in America and it&#39;s not that it&#39;s
a pretty picture in Italy either or
Spain but if you&#39;re in America that is
our system that&#39;s the model for our
system and you have to understand that
to understand what we&#39;re gonna go
through it&#39;s it&#39;s a direct result of the
fact that it&#39;s really not geared towards
public health and the patient it&#39;s
geared towards profits yeah alright so
and I&#39;m not saying this as a political
thing I&#39;m just telling you these are the
facts as a doctor who&#39;s worked in that
system I think everyone on the
frontlines in medicine are now realizing
this you know even in other countries
that have more publicly supported
systems people don&#39;t realize 40 14% of
coronavirus cases in Spain are
healthcare workers one in seven one out
of every seven so people I mean I&#39;ve
been retired from medicine right now I
may get recruited back in but if there&#39;s
a bad enough emergency here but because
I&#39;m still licensed and keep my DEA
number and all that stuff but I&#39;m not in
a hospital right now you know but that&#39;s
amazing then when you think that one in
seven cases in a place like Spain are
the health care workers in America it
could get that bad also
because we don&#39;t have enough personal
protective equipment for them there are
doctors who are using for an entire week
one of those masks which should be used
once and thrown away because they have
to and of course those things are just
laden with the virus so the problem with
that you know it is really bad I have a
son-in-law who&#39;s actually a resonant
medical resident and there&#39;s not
protective gear and a lot of these
hospitals for for these doctors and the
risk of that of course is that it means
that they could get infected but if they
get sick I don&#39;t know which is a worse
scenario they get sick and they&#39;re taken
out of rotation so they can&#39;t help
people or they&#39;re not sick
but they&#39;re carrying the virus and
spreading it to everybody
because there isn&#39;t enough testing to
even test the doctors and the nurses so
this is a situation in which I&#39;m not
trying to depress people at all I mean
we&#39;ll get some more inspiring ideas in a
moment I&#39;m just trying to you know I&#39;m
an emergency doctor if you come into my
er with a brain tumor I&#39;m not gonna tell
you you have a migraine you know and get
playing talk for me no matter what Jim
will tell you I&#39;m like that but what it
means is that we do have to be careful
we have to understand the system&#39;s can
get over brawn but that eventually if we
can get the supply chain stood up but
it&#39;s lagging about three months late
right now and then we can move on where
we&#39;d have enough testing now on the good
news it just announced last night
there&#39;s a company it has a 15 minute
test now that they&#39;re gonna start
distributing next week they&#39;re gonna try
to create 50,000 I think of those tests
pretty quickly and then stand it up to
perhaps maybe Millions the other thing
that&#39;s working on although I don&#39;t think
it&#39;s been cleared yet there&#39;s an
antibody test now what is that what&#39;s
the difference between the coronavirus
testing they&#39;re doing now even the fast
one and an antibody test so just to give
you a little bit of insight on this the
coronavirus test that everyone&#39;s getting
now is actually testing for the live
virus they&#39;re actually testing
for the virus an antibody test would
test for your body&#39;s antibodies that are
created to fight the virus so what that
would mean is is that if we had
widespread antibody testing we may find
that there are millions of people who
have been exposed who had minimal or no
symptoms who are pretty immune and could
get out back in the workforce help other
people etc so the emergence of an
antibody test particularly if it&#39;s
widely available and better yet I would
recommend a home test you know during
the the HIV epidemic they developed a
home test where you could test at home
not even go out at your house and test
and know the results so that&#39;s something
that if that could get created would be
a big I think game-changer because if we
find that there&#39;s large numbers of
people who are already been exposed but
they don&#39;t have to live virus so if you
had an antibody test they said yeah
you&#39;ve been exposed
but then secondarily got a test to see
if the virus is still in you and it
isn&#39;t if it&#39;s not in you as a live virus
but you have the antibodies you should
go ahead and do everything and not have
to be worried that you&#39;re going to be
exposed because you already have been
but didn&#39;t have very bad symptoms so you
would be a very safe person also to
interact with other people because
you&#39;re not going to be carrying the
virus and spreading it around to say
high-risk populations who might need to
have things done at home for them etc
and so on so I&#39;m just giving you this as
a medical update of things that are
emerging and we hope that the medical
science and more importantly a
coordinated global response to the
supply chain and manufacturing of these
things gets that up one of the ironies
of this is that this 15-minute test
that&#39;s coming out you have to have those
you know nasal swabs that you see people
getting swab and there&#39;s a shortage of
those now you can&#39;t believe that
basically a fancy q-tip
lack of a q-tip fancy q-tip has to be a
specific thing in a you know material
you put it in you know that preserves
the virus for the test has to be in some
kind of a solution but there aren&#39;t
enough of those
so we&#39;ve running out of those which is
not high-tech at all which is going to
also slow down the testing because there
aren&#39;t enough of these components you
need to gather the tests all of this
needs to be coordinated unfortunately I
don&#39;t know in other countries in United
States coordination logistics all of
that have completely imploded into chaos
and so this is why we don&#39;t have the
personal protective equipment PPE is why
we don&#39;t have enough swabs
there aren&#39;t enough test kits there
aren&#39;t enough ventilators and these are
all things that should have been stood
up in January in February and now we&#39;re
here we are almost April so looking down
the road all those things could really
be game changers as they come online
until then we need to just kind of like
use this as an opportunity to appreciate
life and make lemonade out of the lemons
we&#39;ve been given yeah absolutely well
said doctor beer and I also just wanted
to add to your message that we will be
doing a live meditation at the end of
this event doctor beer will be leading
us in the meditation for everyone who&#39;s
tuning in spread that around we&#39;re
talking for a while sharing current
events but then we will be coming into
group coherence and a group meditation
so doctor here before we go on too much
I do want to pepper certain questions in
from the trip
sure and you know there&#39;s so many
conspiracy theories going on right now I
think some of the best things you can do
is kind of address them deep moment or
to say you know give us some insight
into what&#39;s true what&#39;s not right okay
our first question is from chadman
taylor for and he says based on your
sources could cope in nineteen B the
preliminary step toward a major false
flag event now I know you and I have
discussed this on the et side what do
you think in regards to the Cova virus
well I think that it it could be my
biggest concern in the last week or so
is that there have been a number of
people using the language in editorials
pundits news anchors
talking about how we&#39;re at book war with
an alien thing literally I mean that
neil degrasse tyson waivers name is
who&#39;s an acolyte of the secret
government denying UFOs are real he&#39;s a
famous astronomer alleged astronomer and
what he said literally was that this is
like invading space aliens then there
was an editorial I read recently where
the manager and chief editor-in-chief of
this magazine stated that we can now all
unite against the common enemy using
exactly Verner von Browns
words when he said we can they&#39;re gonna
use the et issue so that people can
unite against a common alien enemy
I mean it&#39;s virtually word-for-word just
take virus out and put in alien now is
this being done deliberately it could be
or it could be they think the corona
virus went out and got loose and the
people who are wanting to script this
future false flag operation are making
their own lemonade out of these limits
and even their own narrative and
creating their own message to be honest
with you I&#39;m very concerned about that
because there are enough things about
this that do not add up from a public
health and rational point of view that
you if you want to Google to nom as
treatment at the New York Times wrote an
article about in conjunction with this
you know a professor of Epidemiology
that there talks about the fact that a
lot of what we&#39;re doing in terms of
shutting down our whole civilization
doesn&#39;t really make a lot of sense it
makes you wonder how much of this is
being abused by powers-that-be
who quite frankly want to experiment
with how much can we control the masses
how much can we control the media
through fear how much can we unite
people around a common
enemy that&#39;s a global threat they would
be far to go from that to the next thing
that there&#39;s a an alien threat which of
course we&#39;ve already seen agents of the
CIA and dia and aerospace industry
working with the T TSA have already put
that out there you know they put a
little snippet of evidence out and the
disclosure project has things a thousand
times more impressive than the tic-tac
they chased off goes to California
but they&#39;ll feature that because the
narrative attached to it is it&#39;s a
threat to our national security I
remember a couple years ago about the
time that not acknowledged was hitting
hundreds of millions of views on
platforms legal and illegal all over the
world that became the that became the
whole lockstep messaging of the
mainstream media around the UFO issue
and it was all anchored in it being a
threat and I remember people who took
our top-secret military witnesses who
had been an intercontinental ballistic
missile facilities ICBM nuclear launch
facilities where there had been et craft
that had disabled the launch
capabilities and the men that were in
those silos told me they felt the ETS
retain please don&#39;t destroy this
beautiful planet but if you go to a
mutual assured destruction full-out
launch we can shut those systems down
because the earth is too beautiful and
sacred to let you people in one
generation destroy it when it should be
here for hundreds of thousands of years
for the evolution of intelligent
conscious life in the cosmos so what I
but those people who are in the UFO
subculture hijacked these military
witnesses we had identified bundled them
back together put them on the stage did
a documentary had them on Larry King had
them on all these news programs saying
look
the aliens have invaded our nuclear
facilities and are in fact a threat to
our national security and the readiness
of our nuclear arsenal when in reality
the ETS were saying to the and this is
what they told me these men who were
there but the spin the spin wasters who
did this spun it in this direction of
it&#39;s a threat it&#39;s a threat it&#39;s an
existential threat so you can take and I
talked about this briefly in the film
Close Encounters of the fifth kind
that&#39;s coming out about 10 days on April
7th oh by the way you guys all of you
can pre-order it on now Amazon iTunes
and Vimeo and it&#39;s great if a lot on
iTunes because then it can get they
tracked the numbers and maybe we can
open is number one in the world that
will really push this out so those of
you who want to get this do a pre-order
like that it&#39;d be great now I have it
I&#39;ve heard today from my wife that
people can&#39;t get it on Amazon
internationally I don&#39;t know what&#39;s
wrong I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s only
available in the US on Amazon but I know
iTunes should be well right Wow is that
right Jim that&#39;s right dr. Greer iTunes
this worldwide as as Vimeo Amazon is
only in the US on pre-order however
on-street cave will be live in the
international territories okay so
Amazon&#39;s on the date we call street date
is all lingo in Hollywood nobody knows
what street date is but the day these
dong 11 it will Amazon will be
everywhere but for pre-order only in
u.s. linens and and Vimeo you can do
anywhere in the world but the more that
that&#39;s happening on say of iTunes where
the numbers get very high if we can open
as number one in the world what that
means is then it will really help push
it out there so that we begin to get
this out to hundreds of millions of
people eventually so that&#39;s what you
guys can help by doing that for us and
you know I&#39;m going and putting in a
pre-order um what was I talking about
before I got distracted Oh about this
whole question this guy had I think
that&#39;s really a good question because I
think a lot of people that I just bump
into as I go and get groceries
they kind of say to me they sense
there&#39;s some other agenda and I&#39;m not
trying to create a conspiracy thing here
that&#39;s wackadoo I just know I&#39;ve lived
long enough with look the National Press
Club event in 2001 resulted in mmm
almost a billion people saw that
hundreds of thousands of people were
writing to members of Congress in the
United States and Parliament in the UK
and elsewhere demanding that there be a
hearing that this be opened up four
months later 9/11 happened and then I
have a man who was in the vice
president&#39;s office Cheney at the time
who after he was there confided and
shared with us that the plans for that
he saw prior to 9/11 in the vice
president&#39;s office now you know I don&#39;t
see that with any joy I&#39;ve known that
since it happened I haven&#39;t talked about
it much
but I know what these you saps he&#39;s done
acknowledged special access projects are
capable of now does that change anything
we&#39;re gonna do no it just means that we
have to have our eyes wide open and then
do exactly what we&#39;re planning to do one
of the things that that is it&#39;s the
hardest part of doing the work we&#39;re
doing is to not get distracted into
these conspiracies or pulled into that
darkness that&#39;s the bait they want you
to take they want people to be sitting
in their houses by themselves quivering
and fear instead of coming together and
expand its data consciousness and
working together in a peaceful way don&#39;t
give them that victory do not give them
that victory that&#39;s what they want they
want us to be afraid they want us to be
united only through fear or hatred or a
common enemy or what have you they don&#39;t
want humans to be united in a sense of
our spiritual deep oneness in
consciousness or in peace or in
something that could heal the planet and
get rid of poverty and get rid of fossil
fuels through disclosure
project helping me to bring out these
technologies that have been sequestered
for a hundred years they want everyone
to behave out of this sort of coward
beaten down state of fear or shutdown
now what we need to do I have to
understand even our immune systems our
mind our body our consciousness is all
healed by opening up like a lotus not
shutting down with darkness so I think
that regardless of what these
psychopaths are doing what I&#39;ve learned
to do in my lifetime is to stay with the
vision what is our vision or vision is a
new world our vision is universal peace
which is actually what this says one
universe one people the foundation of
that is universal peace
and that is born out of universal cosmic
consciousness and the experience of that
deep spiritual conscious connection that
all life and all humans have is
beautiful so I think we should be really
the more there are these challenges in
the external world the more it ought to
be an impetus and a call to action for
us to discover our inner world and to
connect through inner states of
consciousness and higher states of
consciousness because that&#39;s the
solution not having folks running around
terrified so I think there&#39;s a certain
kind of beauty I always recall you know
the story L know if everyone remembers
love Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s life if you&#39;ve
never seen the movie Gandhi go see it
it&#39;s amazing one of the best and when he
you know was doing his work or her sewer
it was very dangerous and of course
eventually he was assassinated I mean
but that when he was killed it was a
religious fanatic a Hindu nationalist
who killed him because he was trying to
make peace amongst the Muslims the
Hindus the Zoroastrians all the
different people who were in India
and this person was so furiously that he
was out getting raided he was outside of
his house at some event and there was
this man that lift forward and shot him
and but the last thing he did was to
bless him as he went down and kind of
blessed and forgave the person who
assassinated him because he was staying
in that state of higher consciousness
and so that&#39;s kind of an exemplar that&#39;s
sort of I mean it&#39;s a true story it&#39;s
not that it&#39;s not from 2000 years ago it
happened in the 1940s I think India was
founded in 48 or around their late 40s
and so this is in relatively recent
human history as an example of what all
of us should at least aspire to be so
that we or we&#39;ve stay in that state
within ourselves no matter what the
vicissitudes are and the challenges and
the scary stuff that people do so
instead of reacting with fear react with
love and react with not react to go to a
place of love and inner peace and then
help other people to the extent you can
when you&#39;re socially isolated help get
the truth outs of people do something
that is beyond just yourself because
what you find is that people the more
they shut down the more they&#39;re just
focusing on themselves themselves and
the more they do that the more depressed
they are however if they open up their
heart and open up their mind and connect
with other people and connect it then
figure out how they can help that that&#39;s
actually a source of great joy and peace
and also you you&#39;re not just absorbed or
thinking about your own situation which
is very important to do an asset in a
time like this is we should be thinking
about what can we do for others what can
we do for our loved ones but also
neighbors if there&#39;s a person who&#39;s a
shut-in there&#39;s a man not far from us
that his little house is on the about
six inches from the edge of my property
line head south and I was out hiking and
I saw
and I said you need anything I could
state a certain distance he&#39;s probably
close to 90 and he lives in this place
by himself well there are a lot of
people like that so those are little
things everyone can do why not and you
know absorbing certain protocols not to
possibly infect someone of that age and
what-have-you but you know who&#39;s very
very sweet man was very grateful and
turned out his back fence neighbor they
had been looking in on him and helping
him get things so you know if they&#39;re
beautiful things that we can turn into a
situation like this and I think that&#39;s
much more healing for us personally but
as a civilization then running off into
fear-based conspiracy stuff it&#39;s not
that I&#39;m not gonna I&#39;m not gonna ignore
these possibilities that this man asked
about but I think unfortunately most
people stop there that no it&#39;s just to
say yes these humans have always done
the o man&#39;s inhumanity to man and
they&#39;ve always been associate has and
Psychopaths that are demagogues that try
to get power over lots of people
virtually every leader in history with a
few exceptions so I think we have to go
what then what it what do we do and I
think it isn&#39;t about what is someone
else doing that&#39;s not the question what
am I gonna do what is our community
gonna do what does a cd5 community going
to do and so I think that to the extent
we put our focus on something edifying
and beautiful and healing not only will
it be beneficial to everyone it will be
beneficial to us personally I agree dr.
Greer and well said and it is true you
know c5 empowers the individual it lets
you take you know the power back into
your own hands and to go out and make
contact on your own and as we all come
together I think we all realize this
positive shift but there&#39;s so many
questions coming and I want to keep it
moving because so many people are eager
to hear you to make my answer shorter
I&#39;m not good at though we please carry
on as long as you can we appreciate so
we have a really great question here
from Phillip James one of the producers
on see Phillip right can you share
doctor beers some info some of your
inside info you perceived from your
sources on the
virus I know you&#39;ve received a lot of
Intel that you can&#39;t disclose but can
you give the public a briefing on what
might be going on behind the scenes well
what&#39;s going on behind the scenes are
things that I really can&#39;t talk about on
a channel like this without getting
banned I know what it is I know the who
the wat the where it doesn&#39;t change in
anything that I&#39;m going to do or that
you should do I will say that if it&#39;s
handled improperly it could lead to
World War three so I think that we need
to be careful I understand the
responsibility that I have but I&#39;ll just
say that this is probably going to be
something that we&#39;re gonna have to be
dealing with for a year or more to lose
a vaccine there are a lot of twists and
turns that can happen in society our
country as well as others in that period
that we have to be mindful of you know
where there could be you know civil
unrest or martial law impose something
worse than the lockdown we&#39;re all under
now and so I think that we we have to be
mindful of our freedoms and liberties
and not the Haven in a way that leads to
us acting that in a way that justifies
these power-hungry people to clamp down
more you see what I&#39;m saying we have to
be mindful that that every whatever
people start doing if it&#39;s incoherent
violent whatever could lead to we replay
right into their playbook right into
their strategy so I think that we have
to be very smart and not do things that
that go into their strategy you know a
good example of this to make it real is
that after 9/11 everybody was in such a
panic that we passed something called
the Patriot Act in the US Congress and
Senate house that no member of the
Congress read that aloud for
unbelievable.you warrantless searches
and Trudel intrusiveness from
the National Security Agency into our
lives and what-have-you and no one did
anything about it because people are so
afraid and we&#39;re so concerned with
security that they were willing to give
up all their liberty and freedom so I
think that we we have to be mindful of
that
and we have to be mindful that we behave
in a way that&#39;s peaceful and orderly and
but also meaningful where we sort of
respond in a way they may want us to
they may there may be some of these use
apps that want us to respond in a way
that would play right into their hands
does that make sense
100% okay that&#39;s that&#39;s really I think
what we have to have to be careful of
and the other thing is that there could
be some very good therapies coming along
for this there could be a vaccine sooner
than we think there&#39;s a German company
that apparently it may be close we have
to have be very hopeful of that but in
the meanwhile no matter what the twists
and turns and how all this plays out
behave in a way that&#39;s going to be
positive
orderly coherent spiritually-minded
helping others and not devolve as a
civilization into behaviors that might
justify further for lack of a better
term fascistic responses clamping down
responses on people&#39;s personal liberties
and freedoms I think it&#39;s very very
important actually yeah well said dr.
Greer so that actually kind of leads
into our next question and I do want to
remind everyone that we will be doing a
live meditation here at the end of this
livestream so please tune in for that
dr. Greer will be holding a live
meditation we want everyone to tune in
we have a question here from Bella and
she says is the coronavirus
extraterrestrial in origin to raise our
consciousness and bring humanity
together or is this an attempt from the
shadow government to try and curtail the
world&#39;s population another Illuminati
style question dr. Greer but there&#39;s a
lot of them out there for you but it&#39;s
certainly not a vegetable origin
it&#39;s if it were something that was of a
human origin then you know if anyone who
gets there&#39;s a mainstream magazine
called the week which is a summary of
news from around the world that comes
out weekly and the one that I just
received has there they they just sort
of summarize news articles from
mainstream media all around the world
and I like it cuz it&#39;s well-written and
it&#39;s it&#39;s representative across the
spectrum for mainstream information not
this sort of information but they had a
article that I just read last night
before I went to bed
we&#39;re spending go to bed so about 5:00
a.m. but my typical night owl of thing
but it was a article about how the
spokesman for the foreign ministry of
China has stated that this coronavirus
was actually a US bio warfare weapon
that was at in places in the US and then
was brought to Wu Hannah I&#39;ve heard
other people who were US government
scientists claimed it was a Chinese one
so here you have this starting but this
was in the mainstream press I&#39;m not
saying anything for the YouTube censors
I&#39;m not saying anything that&#39;s not been
in the mid MIT mainstream press that was
stated by the foreign ministry of China
spokesperson official spokesperson now
if you know China someone like that
doesn&#39;t say something to the public
without it being cleared from Wei hai
okay in China because it&#39;s a very tough
down government therefore that&#39;s already
being bandied about and you know the
more that does get out the more that
could actually create a lot of
international problems I mean you can
imagine I mean countries have
unfortunately gone to war over less than
something that kills thousands or
millions of people and shuts down an
entire economy so we have to be careful
whether there&#39;s any evidence for that or
not we have to be careful in how we&#39;re
onto it both as a nation but also
individually and I think that whatever
it is we have to say we are not going to
respond the way these unacknowledged
special access projects want us to
because usually the human response is
reflected in that question this us
versus them T versus humans China versus
us this versus that tribalism tribalism
tribalism forever right all right that&#39;s
what they want that&#39;s debate that was
talking about but that&#39;s on the hook
they want us to take the bait and get
hooked into that and I would caution
everyone listening and everyone you know
not to take that bait because that is
the predictable response of humans
because we&#39;ve evolved over you know
hundreds of thousands of years where the
foundation unfortunately a much of our
work society&#39;s organizing is one tribe
against another tribe whether it be you
know a race an economic system a country
a city-state back in the old days or an
old-fashioned tribe all right one tribe
against another that is hardwired
unfortunately into the human psyche
which has been traced to the fact that
we&#39;re 98% genetically identical to
chimpanzees that do the same thing the
spiritual consciousness we have is the
only thing that&#39;s gonna save us from
devolving into these tribal conflicts no
matter how petty or how huge and that&#39;s
why I tell people at the core of the
human crisis whether it&#39;s this moment in
time or looking over the last few
millennia the only way we&#39;re gonna go
forward
since we&#39;re a high-tech civilization
with weapons that could destroy the
entire planet is that we spiritually go
beyond these sort of predictable
tribalistic us-versus-them
ways of thinking and go into a state
where we&#39;re in a
Cosmic Consciousness that transcends all
that noise because then we&#39;re going to
be wise enough to see the bait when it
is put in front of us and not take it
we&#39;re going to be wise enough to avoid
taking the bait
well that that&#39;s the dawn of wisdom so
you know information is nothing whatever
is out there knowledge is rarer wisdom
is the rarest wisdom comes from a
combination of deep spirituality and
experience and knowledge all coming
together so we have to begin to attain
wisdom as a civilization well I really
appreciate that answer and I think that
even segues into us talking a little bit
about the movie Close Encounters of the
fifth kind which of course is all about
the individual learning to make contact
on their own and getting rid of this
fear threat because as you do five and
you experience this phenomena on
yourself you realize that you know it is
there to make contact it&#39;s there to
interact it is not an issue of fear or
an aggressive force now I want to segue
into this because you get into this in
the movie this issue up to the stars
Academy I know you mentored Tom DeLonge
when he was coming up and then the UFO
game it seemed changed his stance that
push this fear-based agenda all the
Sandia folk can be a little bit
surprised about that do you care to
comment on TGS a and just the spirit you
know agenda that they&#39;re pushing in the
media yeah well we you know it is
certainly you can go in google and find
online you know who the people are as
part of t TSA they&#39;re all CIA and other
intelligence operatives there&#39;s a huge
number of them and kind of spooky that
are virologists interestingly enough but
I think that whether you&#39;re talking
about you know semi van or put off or
the people who have done work with you
know kit green and others many many many
of those people I know personally since
the 90s have been at the core of the
majority intelligence community magic
which is the sort of operating umbrella
for the unacknowledged special access
projects I think tom is a well-meaning
person and sincere
who was targeted by some people who were
senior enough that he was impressed by
them and they were able to unfortunately
seed him with ideas and brainwash him
into this direction I don&#39;t think that
he understands that it&#39;s there&#39;s so much
disinformation that has been
manufactured that you can be shown
privately that would convince you of
what his convictions are but those have
been manufactured by counterintelligence
people right so I look at that in a way
it&#39;s sort of frustrating because I&#39;d say
and this is the sad part of what I&#39;ve
done for the last thirty years probably
90 plus percent of all celebrities VIPs
politicians world leaders that I&#39;ve
introduced to this subject have been
secondarily first through unfortunately
googling on the Internet and then if
they&#39;re powerful enough or can influence
an influence or let&#39;s say they are then
targeted by people who put them under
their umbrella under their cape and give
them disinformation that&#39;s extremely
convincing to turn them over to this
perspective of it being an alien threat
I&#39;ve seen this happen if I seen it
happen once with Tom DeLonge I&#39;ve seen
it happen probably a thousand times and
that includes you know government
officials and others and actually the
thing that&#39;s kept me awake the most over
the last thirty years is that what the
hell am i doing because it&#39;s so easy to
trigger you know it&#39;s like a PTSD thing
we sort of have an unspoken PTSD as a
tribalistic warring society it&#39;s so easy
to trigger that us-versus-them response
in human and that&#39;s at the root what
we&#39;re trying to go beyond and the only
way to go beyond that is that somebody
would experience this state this unit of
state the state of
consciousness that is the singularity
that is within every single person and
the only way to do that is you know that
expression but know thyself until I
known self be true and so to know
yourself you have to meditate and go
into this deep quiet place but there&#39;s
this other beautiful quote from the the
Old Persian think is thy self a puny
form when within the the universe is
folded it&#39;s a rhetorical question so in
other words it&#39;s owed English but do you
think yourself just to be a small thing
when in reality the entirety of the
universe is folded within every single
individual human and every single
individual et so what that means is is
that if we go into if we understand that
we&#39;re we are a conscious quantum
hologram where the entirety of all that
exists and has ever existed and will
ever exist is actually folded within the
fabric of consciousness within us that
it was the more we go into deeper and
deeper levels of consciousness the more
we can attain not only the vision to be
seers but pop culture calls remote
viewing but also know the reality of the
past have glimpses into the future know
the reality of what&#39;s going on right now
and be guided with knowledge and wisdom
so this is really important it isn&#39;t
that we shut off our mind or our
intellect or the scientific or objective
ways of getting knowledge we add that
which is a very Western construct to
this ancient construct that all native
peoples and the foundations of all
religions understood before they got
ruined is that the within each person is
this great spirit that is folded and as
we connect to that great spirit we can
not only know things within ourselves
there&#39;s that there&#39;s in the Sanskrit but
I used to be a teacher of Sanskrit in
the Vedas and meditation before I was a
medical doctor I say in my misspent
youth instead of dropping acid and
chasing skirts and this
season 70s I was meditating 6 8 hours a
day and meditation centers and doing
this stuff but it was great and glad I
did it before I went to medical school
but what&#39;s fun about that is that when
you realize that you really don&#39;t need
much to do that you have to have a
certain discipline you have a certain
knowledge and you need some kind of
starting off technique to start with
which is what I teach on the CD 5
initiatives now I teach a number of
things breathing techniques pranayama
a mantra and there are other ways to do
it we had a member of our ce-5 team in
Los Angeles where you are back in the
early I&#39;d say early mid 90s it was a
medical doctor large number of medical
doctors doing cg5 because I&#39;m a doctor
so I&#39;ve made it okay you know because
it&#39;s not okay to do this stuff so I can
kind of like model that for other
physicians I got a joke about how humans
and he kind of needs someone to make it
okay for them by doing it first no
that&#39;s another human trait that I find
very curious cuz I&#39;ve never been like
that I do what I think is right I don&#39;t
care what anyone thinks and I&#39;ve just
been like that since I was in fourth
grade I guess but what happened is that
she was a harpist shiipa had a harp
beautiful and she would play the tones
of that harp and would get into a
brainwave and a movement with it where
she transcended and had these amazing
experiences in higher consciousness
through the harp
so I tell people that&#39;s where you have
to kind of know yourself not everyone
wants to sit for hours in a meditative
state but there are other things you
need to you need to explore your own
reality and know that I like saying it
this way this state of cosmic
consciousness this Samadhi state it&#39;s
like the calm center of the hub of the
wheel of life of existence but if you
look at Earth and there are eight
billion people on earth in reality there
are eight billion unique spokes or
pathways into that hub
now there are certain basic things I can
teach as a teacher and I&#39;ve been doing
this since I was 18 19 years old and
I&#39;ll be 65 in June Lord of Mercy but I
think that Logue have mercy
just a little on arutz Sean so I think
that if we understand that we are all
unique that no two souls are identical
even identical twins and so there is a
unique path for each of us to get to
that hub of inner peace unbounded mind
the beginning of ignorance in the
beginning of n of the end of all
religions and all spiritual traditions
it&#39;s when they become chauvinistic and
bombastic and it&#39;s this way or the
highway when every act because that
leaves out the nuance of the individual
who has to take whatever I can share
with everyone I&#39;ve said this my entire
life and a lot of people who are in
organizations that have been part of
hate for me to say this you take it you
learn it you make it your own and that&#39;s
the best thing that&#39;s teacher can do is
give you that knowledge and give you
some starting off points but ultimately
you and your girlfriend and your
everyone has to find a way to make
whatever are some of the standard
teachings let&#39;s call it and make it your
own and make it effective now with that
said there are clearly some techniques
that are like this called the
superhighway to getting there to the hub
and that&#39;s what I try to teach people
who come on these week-long expeditions
that we do many who have been on in
meditation training programs for twenty
thirty years gain more in one week than
they do in 20 years
I&#39;m not Brad I&#39;m just telling you
because it&#39;s a very powerful maybe at
some point we can do a whole bunch of
these on YouTube so that you know we do
this for millions of people but but I
think that&#39;s really powerful there are
powerful techniques but ultimately
you&#39;re gonna make it your own
so you need to read the book of your own
soul
well said dr. Gary well said so yeah I
just want to follow up on that point and
a couple other stories he told me before
you know one how see I was really the
emphasis that came out the disclosure
project and that&#39;s five you had in
Florida back in the 90s was what
catalysts for the intelligence agencies
approaching it do you mind commenting
about that - depends today yeah I know
because I mean my reality is a different
reality than the public perception of
all this so one of the things I find
sort of sometimes aggravating but
understandable is that people don&#39;t
people think the disclosure project and
the work done in that area was the
primary focus of what we&#39;ve been doing
it was actually a spent an accident of
history so in 1990 when I started this
the the cg5 initiative it was initially
under the Center for the Study of
extraterrestrial intelligence that&#39;s now
become serious disclosure calm and all
that I was only doing this to teach
people to be human ambassadors using
consciousness and higher states of
consciousness to other civilizations and
teaching people the science of
consciousness the meditative approach
remote viewing and then not just viewing
- turning into an active system called
coherent thought sequencing where you
can once you see the craft or an et you
then welcome them and guide them exactly
to where you&#39;re located you vector them
in like you would be guiding a plane to
land at an airport you know or something
through your visualization and vision
and that if you do that in a constant
coherent stream of consciousness with
clear intent to do it for peaceful
purposes to be an ambassador from humans
to their people to do it for positive
reasons and not selfish reasons not a
self aggrandizing reasons not to be
entertained by
lights in the sky not to get their
technology so we can have more military
weapons but doing it really from a pure
hearted place if you can combine the
pure hearted miss and intent with the
technique this is going to be an
outrageous statement to people who don&#39;t
know me and haven&#39;t been on this show we
have never ever done this as a group and
not had UFOs ET craft ET beans appear
never if not wants dozens of times on an
expedition sometimes hundreds of times
so it absolutely works and it works
because these extraterrestrial
civilizations that are also
interdimensional or transdimensional all
their communication technologies are
working through consciousness and
coherent thought folk that&#39;s very
organized and clear not just scattered
whatever but a clear intent so being
coherent and deep consciousness and
making that connection because though
you&#39;re just calling come on down you
don&#39;t know that&#39;s not what we&#39;re doing
no let me that&#39;s the hillbilly version
of it I guess but what we&#39;re really
doing is very respectful we&#39;re asking
the ETS to join with us as a
civilization and we&#39;re doing it not only
for selfish purposes or for the
betterment of the world and the
betterment of their civilizations as
well as sort of a cultural exchange and
so that&#39;s what they&#39;re waiting for
they&#39;re waiting for spiritually minded
people who aren&#39;t doing this for
primitive selfish reasons we reach out
to them so we did that and you know I
started the project in 1990 and then by
1992 I decided I would do a few things
with a larger group so I did this event
for I think it was a weekend in
Pensacola in March of 92 and we did the
the the meditate we did it the afternoon
I was teaching meditation and remote
viewing and every night we would go out
under the stars
on this Beach and sure enough for ET
craft popped in
they got photographed put in the front
page of the New York I mean the
Pensacola paper I forget the name of the
paper and immediately the intelligence
community reached out to me and they
reached out because they were very there
were the calm the white hats were very
excited that we were doing this and had
discovered it the black hats were pissed
off and they were very upset that in
fact we were doing this and went off out
of their control
because they knew that this was the
ATandT amount to the Rosetta Stone of
communicating with interstellar
civilizations they knew this because
remember like Russell Targ who&#39;s in this
movie Close Encounters of the fifth kind
we hope to have him on one of these live
YouTube events soon was you know for
20-some years doing consciousness remote
viewing with the CIA and Stanford
research and he&#39;s a he&#39;s a physicist PhD
physicist brilliant man and a very pure
hearted man and in he you know he states
that this was being done but it had been
done for long before he got involved and
so there&#39;s good evidence that even in
world war ii there were people that were
engaged to do let&#39;s call it spy craft on
both sides who had been east
consciousness some was a psychic
abilities it&#39;s really just innate
abilities that everyone has and because
of that there was this enormous sort of
opening up of abilities to gather
information not using even electronic
systems just using consciousness now
they also knew from the 40s and 50s that
et spacecraft beams had this ability and
Nate Lee but they also added it one more
step they had technologies you know
little devices had looked like your cell
phone there were actually turned on and
all
done by looking at it with clear
conscious intention going there and
turning it on Wow okay so that&#39;s what
ETS have now classified projects have
similar things I don&#39;t have those I&#39;ve
had offered one I didn&#39;t want to take it
because I think it would cost me in my
life and it would have but all I&#39;m
saying is that we can do this innately
because humans we can do this innately
but you need to understand on the other
side of that signal unless they work
making a connection with our
consciousness and mind and thought but
on the other end you have a very
advanced civilizations that have not
only the innate abilities we do and even
more because they&#39;ve been developed for
hundreds of thousands millions of years
longer than we have but they also have
technologies that precisely interface
with thought quanta of thought meaning
everything very and these are
technologies these are physical
technologies so when you understand that
then you understand why the ce-5
protocols work so well right all right
and that&#39;s what this movie this movie is
sort of a primer for hundreds of
millions of people I hope to understand
the science of consciousness and only
what are we doing with ce-5 but how does
it work why would it work and this is
where we get into whole science of
consciousness experiments that are in
this close encounters of the fifth time
documentary I think it&#39;s gonna be a it&#39;s
gonna collect a lot of dots for people
and what Michael Missoula and I tried to
do with this is take it as far as we
could and not lose people within a
two-hour
feature film yeah because you know it&#39;s
fine to reach a few hundred thousand
people this way but we really need to
reach a few hundred million people yeah
okay to do that and thanks to what
you&#39;re doing at your producer on this
and helping get the word out we reach
that number of people then we can hit
that one percent Maharishi effect for
our whole civilization advances
quantum moment a very quick phased
transition it&#39;s called
that I spoke up last week so that&#39;s very
very much as exciting about this
documentary and that in reality
unacknowledged and the disclosure
project were outgrowth of the fact that
I realized back in I guess about 1992-93
and I think the mic sort of oh southern
expression come into Jesus moment was
briefing the director of the CIA I mean
those of you who are in your 30s imagine
being in your 30s being called up to
Washington and yeah I&#39;m working full
time and as an emergency doctor to brief
the sitting director of the CIA because
he had been denied access the perk to
these projects as had his president
which at that time was Bill Clinton I
was in a state of utter shock is one
thing to see this stuff on a conspiracy
YouTube whatever you know or some
History Channel thing it&#39;s another thing
when you&#39;re sitting with the director of
the CIA as a person and realizing that
this ain&#39;t no conspiracy theory this is
really [ __ ] up excuse my language but
it is a mess and so that&#39;s when I
realized we have to do something about
this now between 93 and 98 I had hoped
we continue to do close encounters of
the fifth kind all over the world as you
know this logo occurred in England in
July of 1992 because a group of us about
12 of us went up up to Woodbury Hill and
there Alton barns and we were meditating
and I knew that their actual
intelligences making the the real crop
circles that weren&#39;t hosts unfortunately
now there&#39;s my the 80% host but the real
ones were very highly intelligence
interstellar transdimensional so we went
up there
and I we didn&#39;t as a group we didn&#39;t
know what we were gonna do till we got
there when we got up there we said I
said why don&#39;t we meditate do the CFI
protocols but visualize a very specific
crop circle and ask the ETS to make it
like right now so we did that&#39;s what
they did the next this is one of my
props for today this is from a Japanese
temple that&#39;s very ancient very very old
temple and exactly the shape in three
dimensions this has been around for I
don&#39;t know of thousands of years
probably that a member or team Greg
Sullivan ins in japan sent me and is
from a temple in japan and this is their
symbol and so he got this for me has
bells in them beautiful but that&#39;s what
we did I had never seen this so recently
that&#39;s what we visualized and sent up to
the crop circle makers the ones
responsible for that operation and a
farmer B when it was like barely dawn a
few hours later found exactly what we
had visualized in a field near where we
were Wow and so that&#39;s when all the so
we continued to do that and that at that
same time is when that hundred foot
diameter disc landed or hovered about
ten feet in the field where we were and
we signaled to and it started floating
over towards us unfortunately there was
someone on our team who freaked out
became afraid and it stopped and then
backed off and then went up into the
clouds and just hung around up in the
sky as an amber object for about an hour
hour and a half but the whole time it
was there it was really interesting as
it was moving very slowly
counterclockwise the compass I had was
moving with it counterclockwise Wow and
it was had this magnetic torsion effect
it was so cool but there was this woman
who was so it turned out she was a UFO
person which was a mess
who had done a lot of stuff with the
abduction groups and she just beneath
her conscious awareness had taken into
her belief system all this frightening
negative alien stuff and that craft
appearing triggered that soon as the ETS
sensed her fear they stopped and I hope
you know I&#39;ve been doing this for 30
years and actually since I was a teen
for 45 years 46 years and one way that
you can tell it&#39;s an ET and not a covert
operation masquerading as ETS is that
the actual ETS if they since you are
uncomfortable and afraid they back off
we&#39;ve seen this of zillion times where
as a covert military human project that
looks like it&#39;s alien that&#39;s a false
flag a deceptive operation they&#39;re gonna
keep coming and coming and coming and
coming
they&#39;re not gonna back off right that&#39;s
how you know people say you know that
that sounds pretty you know crazy I said
yeah but that&#39;s exactly you know what is
a little part of this film we&#39;re talking
you know someone from the Air Force says
yeah we&#39;ve done these abductions and
here&#39;s why so I think that we have to
understand that so the the whole
disclosure movement was a result of
first having the intelligence community
realized that this group of people just
sort of on their own have begun to push
out into the world the ability to bypass
the entire government and all these
covert programs News I say the ce-5
initiative is the ultimate cosmic civil
disobedience program for earth because
it&#39;s everyone coming together saying CIA
Pentagon covert programs corporations
see you wouldn&#39;t want to be you
we&#39;re not gonna dance to your tune
anymore we&#39;re gonna do this on our own
and that&#39;s I&#39;m telling you is the most
powerful thing people can do it&#39;s it&#39;s
it&#39;s a virtual cosmic storming of area
51
but nonviolent not with your physical
bodies trying to batter down a fence
this is the real cosmic disclosure it&#39;s
humans making contact but to get to that
what I had what I realized from 93 until
98 was number one the president no
president was going to make this happen
number two the Congress was going to be
stood down from it number three the
united nations because i briefed the
senior United Nations people the wife of
the UN secretary-general etc none of
them were going to take this on and then
that&#39;s why I went public with the
disclosure project to Knollys show what
a problem we were in governance but to
also put forward military and government
documents and evidence if people
wouldn&#39;t begin to realize this is real
and not just something for the national
enquirer because without enough people
understanding through the disclosure
project and then unacknowledged that
this is real if you don&#39;t think it&#39;s
real you&#39;re not going to go out and make
contact this is obvious so I&#39;ve had to
work this system I&#39;ve had to go step one
was me starting off with the with the
Close Encounters of the fifth kind in
ishutin I quickly realized we had a huge
problem of governance but also a vacuum
out there in public understanding that
had to be corrected and here we are now
20-some years later after i briefed the
CI directors then 26 and a half years
where I&#39;ve come to realize we have got
to figure this out in a systematic way
and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been working on for
these quarter of a century and now it&#39;s
time for millions and millions of people
to understand consciousness understand
they can become very centered in
consciousness they can become points of
coherence all of us doing that together
will create what we call this Maharishi
effect where 1% of us aligning
incoherence moves all of society into a
beautiful state of enlightenment and
orderliness very quickly
and that the movement has to be from
within but a lot of people doing it all
over the world
beautiful response dr. Gary I appreciate
that so we&#39;ve got so many questions
coming in let&#39;s keep them rolling
because there&#39;s no fix this one is
actually from one of your fellow team
members Russell Freeman
what&#39;s the know about he says can you
please ask dr. Greer about suppressed
medical applications of UFO level
transdimensional science and technology
to help the corona crisis do these
technologies exist and could they use
them to help us if they wanted to baby
and who the ETS the ETS or you know
other humans that have these types of
technologies Europe I mean look what I&#39;m
saying this as a doctor and I have a
healthy respect for things we can do I
also know that our bag of therapies as a
doctor is one-tenth full because the
sciences and technologies that have been
around for decades and classified
projects are not allowed to be used and
you what you have to understand we just
are getting into energy medicine and
very subtle transdimensional physics and
electronic systems is that you can
absolutely make any virus or bacteria
what have you just basically dissolve
through the correct frequencies in
electronics the problem with those being
disclosed to the public in this crisis
is that the same technologies applied in
a slightly different way would give you
free energy which means the end of the
petrodollar system the end of oil gas
coal nuclear power public utilities now
that&#39;s more than a thousand trillion
dollars in financial and commodity
assets that will vanish so you think the
few trillion we lost in the stock
markets a lot this is one of the
problems is that we have gone so far
suppressing these things
that our civilization is addicted to the
very technologies that are not only
killing us and the planet but are also
keeping away from the public the
technologies that would heal us and the
planet so it&#39;s a double whammy
which is why contact and disclosure is
so important everyone thinks this is a
fringe issue it isn&#39;t because if think
about it if the most important
scientific discoveries in a hundred
years have been ruthlessly suppressed
which they have been it really means we
don&#39;t really have a free-market economy
we don&#39;t have a free press we don&#39;t have
the technologies that would help us not
only combat but make a epidemic like
this vanish very quickly and I know for
a fact that those technologies exist I
don&#39;t have them and anyone I can tell
you if anyone at MIT or Caltech or
Harvard or wherever it stumbles across
this it&#39;s known the instant they do and
they have those technologies confiscated
under a national security order NSO I
know people that has had that happen to
them now if anyone has such a technology
I&#39;ve been saying pass it on to me I&#39;m
willing to go to prison I&#39;m willing to
be killed and I will put an open-source
on the internet for millions of people
to see that hadn&#39;t happened yet
but I&#39;m willing to do it but it&#39;s got to
be something that isn&#39;t snake oil that&#39;s
got to be something that&#39;s rigorously
provably true but I&#39;m just saying in
terms of answering this person&#39;s
question absolutely those technologies
already exist and we don&#39;t need them
from the ETS moreover as I said last
time I was on this YouTube live seminar
if the ETS were to do this in a way that
it was them doing it it would
immediately be seized on by the spin
Meister&#39;s not just at ETS a but by
governments all over the world as alien
invasion week on the History Channel
name writ large so the ETS know
that we have to lead this we have the
knowledge we have the technologies we&#39;ve
suppressed it but for the most part
people don&#39;t want to do it I would say
that the billionaires that I&#39;ve met are
terrified of being assassinated and
unfortunately the everyday average
person doesn&#39;t want to help they just
want to be entertained by this and I
don&#39;t say that in a bitter way I&#39;m just
saying as a matter-of-fact way I&#39;m very
grateful by the way to all the people
listening who contributed to our
crowdfunding campaign at ce-5 film comm
but that&#39;s less than four thousand
people you know this webinar this
webcast will probably have a couple
hundred thousand people see it if only
10% of those people went and made
contributed $10 at ce-5 film comm we
would have enough to just push this
information out and bury the mainstream
media that keeps suppressing it yeah but
people have to actually go there and do
that so I see that say this in a
slightly chiding way only to say that we
collectively have the world that we have
created and the future world that we
want a world of free energy peace
interstellar contacting travel all of
that we can do within our lifespan by
the way but we have to come together and
do it it isn&#39;t gonna be done by the
President and isn&#39;t gonna be done by
Elon Musk it isn&#39;t going to be done by
some billionaire it&#39;s going to have to
be done by a People&#39;s Movement from the
ground up because that&#39;s the only way it
can happen and unfortunately I&#39;ve tried
every other way I&#39;ve met with a whole
lot of billionaires who know all this is
real they&#39;re too afraid to do it they
feel they be too big of a talk mark
target same thing with politicians but
the average person can do this so you
see if a million people realize this and
each of them put in $10 a month
do the math there&#39;d be a hundred and
some million dollars that we could open
the state-of-the-art lab and develop
both medical
free energy technologies that we would
never patent I mean my Val I&#39;ve said
this for a very long time but the open
source as soon as there was a discovery
the whole Lab would be live-streamed
like this it would go on the Internet to
millions of people that&#39;s what we would
do but we have to have the public
support to do it so in the meanwhile
what I&#39;m trying to do is to create the
the ground for that to happen by
augmenting and and bringing up human
consciousness making consciousness of
all of humanity rise upward to where
enough people awaken where that can
happen so that&#39;s why I think this
documentary is by far the most important
work that we&#39;ve done because on the
success of the disclosure project and
unacknowledged now there are enough
people that we can reach to this where
the activation of human consciousness
and within human consciousness cosmic
consciousness can happen and that&#39;s
where everything will begin to really
take off vertically incredibly response
dr. veer so do a couple more questions
here and I just wanna remind everyone we
are gonna be doing a live meditation at
the end of this event probably maybe 30
minutes most will hit that so please
tune in get all your friends here we
want to get group coherence we want to
reach that 1% one more question here on
regarding the New World Order dr. Greer
from Chadwick 55 risen there&#39;s a
question we get a lot why would a group
a shadow government release I think
deadly in society in you know don&#39;t they
face the same repercussions as us that
they destroy the economy and the planet
how are they immune from the
repercussions of these negative actions
they&#39;ve already gained all these things
out and they are they have facilities
and solutions that I just spoke about
where they wouldn&#39;t be affected and you
know I sat with enough powerful people
who are a part of this majority
Intelligence Committee or cabal whatever
you want to call it who are you know the
worldview is there are the chosen ones
and the rest of us are expendable
and they&#39;re just weird I don&#39;t know how
to put it any other way there a number
of them are weird into the world freaks
like Prince hans-adam von Lichtenstein
who told me you know gee if we can if a
reason I&#39;m funding all the abduction
groups and giving them all this money is
because if we can get enough people to
hate the aliens we can have an
interplanetary war so most of humanity
is destroyed so Jesus will return now
he&#39;s not the only prominent person who
has said this to me in a private meeting
I mean it&#39;s frankly excuse my language
batshit crazy but that&#39;s you know a lot
of thinking the other part of thinking
is how do we control a maximum number of
people sort of a statism or fascism view
under the condition that they&#39;re afraid
of something that we can control them
completely so this is I think a more of
a fascistic view of it and remember you
know Paul Mellon and Allen Dulles and
these people who founded the CIA at the
war into World War two those were avowed
support ler supporters of fascism and
Hitler before World War Two was
officially declared I&#39;m friends with one
of Paul melon&#39;s grandsons and who has
told me this personally so I think that
people have to understand you have some
very strange ideologies they can run the
gamut from fascism and control to sort
of an end of the world
weirdness what I call hyper religiosity
you know in psychiatry a lot of people
who are a little bit crazy have this
hyper religiosity as opposed to
spirituality and that you get into these
fanatical and crazy cults of belief
systems which frankly it&#39;s what most
organized religions devolve into at some
point or have extreme branches of them
kind of the lunatic fringe so that&#39;s
that&#39;s they they actually believe
they&#39;re doing the work of God by doing
that kind of stuff so that&#39;s how I know
it sounds strange an idea my wife and I
often won&#39;t wander around our house and
go a phone call happen or me and they
would say you you can&#39;t make this stuff
up and if if it had been a reality TV
show where someone could have had the
meet he&#39;d been on the meeting been a fly
on the wall or had it live stream it
would have been it would have crashed
everyone&#39;s view of the world in reality
and we&#39;re dealing with people the real
folks who are have these sort of
connections in the world so I&#39;ve learned
to just kind of roll with that
it is personally very stressful but I
deal with it by doing my own way of
dealing with it meditation having fun
being with dogs being a teacher by the
way the wonderful expression the best
way to love God is to love is creation
as I think it from the Persian so that
the idea is that if you look at the
beauty of nature and of the stars that
have the natural creation it&#39;s the outer
garment of the creative force the
conscious creative force as opposed to
man-made stuff so I love I think people
forget how beautiful but also how deeply
spiritual just the natural world is
hadith not only the stars in other
worlds with this planet and life and the
oceans and the forests and the animals
because they&#39;re pure they&#39;re not
contrived there&#39;s no guile so that&#39;s a
beautiful thing and I think the more
people can connect to that in whatever
way you do is wonderful because that&#39;s
how I first found a deep spirituality
because I was raised in a family of
agnostic atheists didn&#39;t believe in
anything but I found it through my
communion and oneness with nature and
the beauty of nature in the Blue Ridge
Mountains how beautiful and that is of
course what the movie is all about it&#39;s
about learning to make
check the origins of c-5 and how you can
empower yourself to go out there every
night or in the daytime and have that
connection through these protocols and
anytime anywhere this is what&#39;s
beautiful you don&#39;t have to be on a team
with me and I won&#39;t wear on one of the
things I always say to people is I love
the when I was interviewing a meeting
with I think was Laurie Williams who
does a lot of the remote view training
as a shout out to her she&#39;s great she&#39;s
not in the film because I just ran out
of space for everyone we met with but
she&#39;s one of the points that she made I
think she makes this point in third eye
spies Russell talks yeah it&#39;s a
documentary that was done came out last
year I believe and she makes the point
that when they&#39;ve done studies they&#39;re
the people who are the identified
experts in remote viewing but then they
did a study where they just pull people
off the street give them a few simple
instructions and the every bade a person
on the street was as good at doing it as
the ones who were the preferred experts
right and I remember having this
conversation with many of you may know
the name of a guy named Ingo Swann who
was a big supporter of what we were
doing have a beautiful letter from him
Wow where he writes about how what we&#39;re
doing with ce-5 this is back in the 90s
before he passed away is really what he
wish he had done instead of getting
involved with the intelligence community
that sort of just played on him but that
he you know had these amazing abilities
but he and I used to talk about I said
everyone has this ability they just
don&#39;t embrace it you know there&#39;s
nothing special about me or Inga or what
have you
what&#39;s special is that every single
human and et are conscious and sentient
and can be aware of awareness and
through that whatever you&#39;ve heard the
greatest remote viewer or psychic or see
here that exists ever exists on the
planet has done you can do every single
one of you and we are programmed because
we tend to like kind of cults a person
which is often why I&#39;m sort of not
vulgar but sort of brusque and I don&#39;t
like that I think it&#39;s a it&#39;s very
inappropriate to i dollop you have
idolatry of a person you can respect
someone as a teacher but it devolves
into these weird cults right and and I
think that that&#39;s extremely deleterious
to human evolution because what people
are doing they&#39;re giving up the
responsibility to be them what they can
be by idolizing someone else as if they
can&#39;t do it when in reality whatever
you&#39;ve heard that any of these people
have ever done everyone listening right
now can do absolutely hundred-percent
and you need to embrace that so long as
you believe that you can&#39;t you won&#39;t
right and I have found that the
difference between people who can really
do ce-5 and meditate and have these
experiences is the people who actually
have a positive attitude that say well I
can do that and because they tell
themselves they can they do but if
you&#39;re of a mind set oh I can&#39;t do that
only Ingo Swann can or dr. Greer or
whoever right what is rubbish
that&#39;s rubbish so the studies have
demonstrated and this is why I love when
Laurie spoke of this and and thirai
spies it&#39;s that it turns out that
everyone has this ability if they give
themselves to it there is a little bit
of discipline in process and there are
different techniques but it isn&#39;t as if
someone can do it and someone can&#39;t
right and the people who say that&#39;s the
case are just trying to create some kind
of cult of personality or something I
think it&#39;s actually very very
destructive I think it&#39;s more important
that everyone says we&#39;re all unique
individuals and where we are but in our
potential we are all the same now what
we&#39;ve expressed I mean me I did have the
opportunity to be a renegade enough when
I was 18 19 20 my early 20s to spend
eight hours a day meditating and
studying the Vedas and going all over
the world
before I went into Medical School
because I was a renegade and I wanted to
do something different than what I was
supposed to do you know as soon as
someone says this is what you should do
I&#39;m doing the opposite I&#39;m a cop
preparing but I&#39;ve always been a
renegade but I think that most people
buy into this and limitations but if you
put a limitation on yourself you&#39;ve put
yourself in that cage and so who has the
key not me you you have e to unlock your
own potential the most I can do is take
you through some knowledge and wisdom
maybe give you some techniques and then
you experiment with it and as soon as
you experiment with it in a way of I can
do this absolutely you&#39;re gonna find
that there is a positive feedback loop
where your your skill at remote viewing
and ce-5 in context gonna go straight up
like this right you got to believe in
yourself believe in yourself to do it
well set and that is of course what the
movie is all about the history CD by on
how to teach it and the incredible
examples of the phenomenon that has been
documented right exactly
well when you see folks when you see
what&#39;s in this movie you&#39;re gonna go oh
my god it&#39;s just like the things the
images the cg5 not only just the
spacecraft and the end of what happens
but the stories behind some of the
intimate contact that&#39;s happened and you
realize that those all those things are
things that other people have done many
of them without me even being there
which is I&#39;m one of these people who I
love the idea that people do can do
these things if I was in a cave and no
one even knew who I was I don&#39;t
III like leading meditation we&#39;re gonna
do that but I actually get really happy
when I hear somebody in some remote part
of the world in Africa where is
practicing the ce-5 protocols and had
this amazing contact experience happened
that I that really makes me happy for
sure for sure at once in
ce-5 which is also narrated by Jeremy
Piven you know opening the movie he
Jeremy Piven quotes and he says this is
the seed by protocols of the most
dangerous information dr. career has
released to the public yet why would he
say that dr. berry about the CFI
protocols because this is how we&#39;re
going to completely stand down fascist
unacknowledged special access projects
secrecy but also those interests that
have thwarted human enlightenment and
human civilization development for
probably a century at least that by
doing this and coming together in mass
consciousness we can absolutely break
away and it&#39;s sort of like without
leaving our world we&#39;re in a sense are
creating this 1% break out civilization
transformation civilization that as we
gather together and do that it&#39;s going
to then suddenly bring the entire planet
along so that&#39;s why this 1% effect were
1% of people in coherence if you hit
that number the entire population
becomes more peaceful and orderly and
enlightened and conscious and and
actually with the studies that have been
done in neuro science they found that
people&#39;s IQs go up as they meditate more
and more you actually go higher than
your birth IQ that&#39;s been measured when
you&#39;re younger your intelligence your
they&#39;ve actually found that you know
neurons which are the cells in the brain
the dendrites and axon Oh connections
that sort of ways that neurons connect
those increase so in when you&#39;re in a
meditative state those are actually
being enlivened so like when we meditate
in a few minutes just know that as you
go into meditation you are actually
enlightening awakening and making
connections even in your physical brain
and this has been measured of
neuroscience MRI studies so it&#39;s really
exciting and when you think about
millions of people doing that where we
now have the science to show
the power of the conscious field and
that the science of consciousness is a
real science that&#39;s been known the
course for millennia in other cultures
but that in in our civilization today
we&#39;ve actually been able to document
improve the power of consciousness on
the communities we live in and that
alone I&#39;m not gonna make any claims here
but that alone could greatly change the
course of this pandemic yeah by people
doing thank you doctor that leads me to
our next question from Scott Howard here
and it says what are steps to shifting
reality right now what people what can
people do to shift reality right now
given this epidemic well the most
important thing the shift reality is to
go into the meditative state but do it
together and with increasingly large
numbers of people that that&#39;s what we&#39;re
talking about because mass consciousness
a single person they&#39;ve done studies has
a certain effect to people that are
united love each other is not to times
effect is ten times the effect so
imagine if at some point we can build
this what do we call this thing YouTube
wife thing we&#39;re all at once we have a
million people doing this and then we
begin to focus on certain the only state
of consciousness but then from that
state view certain outcomes view in a
positive way healing things that I think
he&#39;d be astounded at the effect it would
have and that&#39;s been proven uh dr. Larry
Dossey who&#39;s I think an internist in
Dallas wrote a book recovering the soul
many many years ago in the 90s 80s maybe
but he studied people in meditative but
also prayerful states
I was called intersession Airy prayer
where they would be very far away and
may not even know the person that we
just told about the person and they
would ask to do a meditation in a prayer
that they could measure the effect on
that person but what if all of us did
that for the human body but all of us
all eight billion people
and Gaia the living organism known as
Earth
this living organic connected conscious
organism so here&#39;s another thing that
most people don&#39;t think about we&#39;re
conscious but so is the earth now the
earth is not a human but she is a female
she is absolutely a conscious living
awake being and we can connect with her
through our own consciousness because
consciousness is a singularity as the
famous physicist Soren Schroeder said
the total number of minds in the
universe is one and this has been proven
it&#39;s a singularity all of us are
disconnected from each other through the
illusion Maya it&#39;s called of separation
but in reality I&#39;m awake right now
you&#39;re awake right now you&#39;re a unique
individual I&#39;m a unique individual but
the awareness whereby we are awake that
which enables us to be conscious that is
one and that&#39;s mine think about that
everyone listening thousands and
thousands of people there&#39;s actually one
conscious field that is enabling you to
be awake so to go into quiet state and
connect to that and then you&#39;re
connecting to everything it&#39;s very very
powerful but it&#39;s also very healing
because it&#39;s this expansion it opens the
heart and mind together in a way that
the body is really healed your body and
once we radiate that out other bodies
other people and the body of the earth
the conscious living being of the earth
so I&#39;m giving you a preview of the
meditation I&#39;m going to do wonderful
sounds wonderful doctor very so this
strange thing yeah here it is what do we
look at doctor yeah well this was an ET
an extraterrestrial appeared with the
ant about right next to the head of the
naval research this
scientists of the neighbor research labs
and his son and had and drew this
amazing shape it&#39;s kind of toroidal but
it&#39;s got it&#39;s got a really thin spot but
it it&#39;s like a mobius strip but it&#39;s not
it&#39;s much more complex see there it
won&#39;t you here&#39;s a side view here&#39;s the
other looks just like that but it&#39;s a
continuous now it took them through
cad/cam years accurately create this
believe it or not at the naval research
labs and before this man died he gave
this to me it probably should if anyone
has an extrusion stainless steel
extrusion system where we could laser
now we have technology we could laser do
this and 3d print it out but in metal
stainless steel or something we need you
should make a great big one and I&#39;ll put
it out in front of my farm in the house
and it&#39;s for whirl around see what
happens maybe we&#39;ll go into another
dimension I don&#39;t know with it but the
et very specifically said it had
something to do with the energy and
propulsion components well and by the
way this scientist was very much in sync
with us very much supportive and I think
that&#39;s why that contact event happened
because they knew this guy I would have
never been able to either reproduce or
draw this but isn&#39;t it cool so this is
the only one remaining that I know of in
the world so I wanted people to show it
in case my house burns down or something
but it&#39;d be cool it&#39;s so cool yeah
anyway yeah behind that it was a little
show until all right this house is
chock-full of strange things sure I&#39;m
sure
so I thought you would share maybe one
last contact story from the you know we
could go to the meditation I thought it
might be interesting for the viewers to
hear the story of Ed Moen and and what
he went through and see what a beautiful
soul yeah yeah you know I think people
you know
I can say that what I&#39;m going to share
with this story has happened many many
many times the unique thing about this
is that we actually have a photograph of
the et that&#39;s not been photoshopped
nothing it&#39;s just there it is so we were
up in a place in Arizona a little
community called Oracle ironically like
the Oracle of Delphi and we were doing
one of these week on retreats with me I
was teaching people in the afternoon
what we do for those of you want to come
in the future
we could train everyone in meditation
remote viewing the Vedas science of
consciousness very advanced concepts
during the day and then at night we
apply those and do our group meditations
with cameras and sitting out under the
stars till 2:00 3:00 4:00 in the morning
well I tell the babies like only the
babies the new people they go to bed at
1:00 but the hard core folks stay up
till 3:00 or 4:00 and I&#39;m an emergency
doctor who was accustomed to working 36
hours straight without break so you know
fine we&#39;ll do it crazy but hey that&#39;s my
life but it was so beautiful because
this man he had had no hearing without
assistant hearing aid since he was in
middle school or high school and Edie is
an entrepreneur lives up in the Midwest
and he came on these trainings and we it
was part way through the week and we
were doing you know the meditations for
remote viewing and then the coherent
thought sequencing protocols all these
are going to be in the new app it&#39;s not
on the stores yet but it&#39;s gonna be
called see each app and it should be
available April 7th fingers crossed
globally on iTunes and Google it can be
really cool at this tab
but what we&#39;re gonna do what we were
doing with all these protocols and then
you know after a while people can&#39;t be
in a meditative state for four or five
hours so we take a little break and we
were all sitting around but we were in
this meditation and we had heard
in a meditation this being walking
behind me right behind me here in a
circle and that I several people heard
it and have a friend Robbie who&#39;s a
medical student beside me and next to
him was this man Edie and I went wow
they&#39;re here and so there was a very
well-known screenwriter named David mark
Cooney who wrote enemy of the state with
Will Smith does he seen the movie and
look it up and he has a great camera and
I don&#39;t do cameras because I would just
break them I break everything I&#39;m not
good with machines except respirators
and Revelator&#39;s but so he I said David
there&#39;s something over here so he had
his camera facing right over towards me
that then extended a couple people over
to her Edie was and suddenly what we saw
with the naked eye was like a ruby red
teardrop shape object that came right
between Robbie and this man it moment
and a whole bunch of people saw that
it&#39;s very quick bang but with the naked
eye and like a beautiful ruby crimson
red object the film it was a digital
camera lens was open at that instant and
because of the light cells and
sensitivity of these new digital cameras
it showed this entire five six foot tall
ET that had this triangular face right
next to Edie that was wearing like a
tunic and you&#39;ll see this in the movie
and Ed Moen started to continue to have
but connection with this et that even
after the group left that night he
continued on throughout the wee hours of
the morning and at some point he was
doing this he was called to go back
outside he&#39;d gone back into his room
after we broke circle and he was just
towed into Italy to go out so he did and
he saw this red object again began to
connect
and he said and he was doing this to be
an ambassador but then he just sort of
innocently said and by the way I have
such a hard time hearing I&#39;ve not had
proper hearing since I was a teenager if
you could do something about this they&#39;d
be great and the next morning he woke up
with normal hearing now this guy had had
40 50 50 years of really severe hearing
loss and he literally took his hearing
aids out never has worn him since and so
I tell people that the key thing here is
that people are gonna immediately hear
this story and jump to oh I&#39;m gonna go
do see if I because I want to be healed
know the e if you do it for that they&#39;re
gonna say you know you&#39;re in this the
wrong headspace he was doing it out of a
pure hearted intention to be an
ambassador to these civilizations and
put himself at service to the greater
good but in that context he then
parenthetically said will you help me
with this and they did you see that this
for difference hundred percent he had
gone out there and said god damn and
I&#39;ve come all this way I want you to fix
my hearing never gonna happen
yeah all right never gonna happen so
people need to hear what I&#39;m telling you
there&#39;s a importance is the pure
heartedness the purposefulness the
motive where are you and your head and
heart and if that&#39;s clear I&#39;ll tell you
absolutely anything is possible but
you&#39;ve got to be in that space first
that&#39;s the prerequisite it&#39;s just like
the prerequisite to being an
interstellar civilization is that our
civilization is peaceful we&#39;re not going
to be welcome out there if we go out
there with weapons and with this mindset
it&#39;s tribalistic mindset of us versus
them no that is a deal breaker that&#39;s
why there&#39;s a basically you talk about
quarantine for decades there&#39;s been a
quarantine around the earth by these ETS
not to let humans too far out there
because we haven&#39;t become peaceful we&#39;re
not civilized we&#39;re not
a level one civilization that&#39;s living
peacefully and in a non harmful way to
our planet or to each other or to
potentially other worlds out there and
remember there are entire planets out
there that are very advanced that don&#39;t
even have a word in their vocabulary for
war they just don&#39;t so we are considered
a high risk place and if you doubt it
look around don&#39;t people come to my
emergency department on a Saturday night
so I just think that you you have to
look at this in a way that is realistic
but you&#39;re in the right place
spiritually and in your heart and mind
anything can happen
healing for your healing for the planet
yeah it&#39;s beautiful so I would recommend
that that&#39;s how we go into this
meditation we go into this meditation
with something that while there may be
some enlightened self-interest for
ourselves that we began to in an
expanded way be more concerned about the
greater good
the world the cosmos altruism healing I
think that we you know need to get into
that pure-hearted place and understand
the technique of consciousness and
meditation and then anything is possible
it&#39;s just beautiful what can happen well
so after here so let&#39;s segue into the
meditation I think it&#39;s the perfect time
everyone will do that yep and on oh my
goodness that&#39;s longer than they thought
Namaskar is yep alrighty well look okay
so in the next 15 seconds everyone tweet
or send a message out to all your
friends to jump on this livestream so we
have a big mass meditation right now and
just let everyone know now we&#39;re gonna
do it wherever you are whatever time
zone so I&#39;m gonna close my eyes so if we
can close our eyes all together and I&#39;ll
leave this meditation after you
contacted your friends to jump on this
livestream
okay so now with our eyes closed let us
become aware of the mind that is hearing
the voice and since that you are
conscious and awake but that the mind
whereby you&#39;re awake is one and that
everyone meditating right now can sense
that they are awake and feel in their
heart that we are connected all together
in this great spirit and now let us take
some deep cleansing breaths and in with
our nose and out with our mouth and with
each n-word breath see your mind
expanding and of great light in the
center of your forehead expanding and as
we exhale feel yourself becoming relaxed
and exhale fully and release into the
purifying breath of Mother Earth all of
your limitations all of your worries
all of your concerns and fears all that
withholds you from oneness and see them
dissolve in vanish
with each inward breath we become more
expanded and aware of this infinite mind
within us with is each exhalation we
become more calm and centered and at
peace now let us become aware that the
conscious mind whereby we are observing
our own breath our thoughts the voice
your body at that conscious mind is like
an infinite ocean and all these
perceptions and all that exists in the
creation whether you Steve it or not are
like waves and ripples moving on this
infinite ocean of mind cosmic
consciousness and as
all that exists is made of the same
consciousness stuff of the vast ocean of
awareness and we become aware that our
bodies the earth ourselves the Stars the
photons all life all that exists all of
this is emanating and manifesting from
this unbounded conscious mind which is
the consciousness within us it is never
far away it is always the essence of our
being
knowing this let us very gently go deep
in this quiet mind and let go of the
surface of perceptions and thoughts
neither pushing them out nor embracing
them but relax and become aware of this
infinite ocean of consciousness within
us
and now go more deeply still and it is
pure light and consciousness it is
unbounded by space or time it is
unlimited and infinite and because it is
unbounded and infinite it is it its
fullness in every point in space and at
every point in time because it is
indivisible
it is the singularity it is the oneness
it is the core and root of our being
being thus aware of the true nature of
our own consciousness let us now see
that our bodies are filled with this
conscious energy and light and see that
the earth itself that she is an awake
conscious being and wherever you are
sitting see the energy and consciousness
of the Earth coming up through your
bodies through your chakras into your
mind and then up through yourself into
the world and space around us
with a steady vision see that we are
inseparable from the earth and one
another and we can see this conscious
light and healing energy come up through
us and heal each of us and then open
your heart and mind and see that field
of pure conscious energy and healing
spread to all those in the communities
around you washing away all that harms
denaturing and removing all that makes
ill and see in the heart of your
compassion all those who are in illness
healed enlightened cleansed by this
infinite pure ocean of conscious light
and as we stay with this meditation let
us very gently become aware that
consciousness the mind whereby you are
awake right now isn&#39;t limited to your
body but is in fact omnipresent and
because it is omnipresent let us quietly
intend without straining to rise upward
above ourselves into the community above
us and let us see the countryside or the
city around us and as we rise upward
into the sky we send blessing and
healing and light and love to all those
around and then as we rise further we go
higher effortlessly into the sky above
us and now we can see for hundreds of
miles above the earth and then thousands
of miles as we rise upward through the
atmosphere and as we gain great altitude
in our vision we see in the center of
our vision the entire earth our mother
earth is an awake conscious being and
she loves us and we love her and her
love is the most pure and unconditional
love and we return that to her infinite
love back to the earth and to her
children all who dwell on earth
and we feel that and we see it and then
we rise further into father sky and we
see father sky all around us and it is
infinite and in truth the cosmos has no
beginning nor end nor does consciousness
and so as within ourselves this infinite
ocean we are also one with the infinite
cosmos and as we gently float out into
space we behold the earth and the moon
and the Sun and Mercury and Venus and
Mars and all the planets and we behold
that each and every planet is an awake
conscious being
and some are male and some are female
but they are all awake and they are
spinning in an ocean of light that is
infinite and that space itself is one
and integrated with this cosmic mind
within us and we are one with that
cosmic consciousness and then in this
state we become aware without straining
that there are extraterrestrial
civilizations some of whom have
representation in our solar system and
some from galaxies very far away and we
connect to them as ambassadors from the
earth to their people and in universal
consciousness we established Universal
peace
invite them to gaze upon the earth with
us in this meditation and ask them to
send healing light and energy to the
earth and all beings both
extraterrestrial and celestial in the
worlds of light join us and we gaze upon
the earth with the eye of oneness and
behold the earth is his beautiful planet
and there are a billion souls who live
upon her and connecting to this infinite
cosmic mind and all the beautiful and
healing powers of the cosmos and those
are folded within each of us we gently
focus on the earth n-b-c array from the
infinite Sun of cosmic beam coming into
the earth and spreading across the earth
healing the planet and humanity and
bringing us together as one people in
one universe and as we stay with this
vision of constant streaming
consciousness we see the earth filled
with joy and the burden we have placed
upon the earth of being lifted and
humanity brought together for this is
the time of the great transformation and
this is how it will happen all of us
together we are all one in spirit in
pure consciousness namaste
mm-hmm well thank everyone for joining
us I&#39;m just coming back I hope you will
all subscribe to the channel so we can
kind of be in touch with you and let
your friends know we&#39;re gonna do these
sort of things as often as we can thanks
to the Moriarty&#39;s and Jem I figured out
how to use a computer properly so we can
I&#39;m such an idiot about some things
actually so I&#39;ll admit my weaknesses but
now that I&#39;ve sort of figured this out
I&#39;m still getting my legs on we can do
this more often and create community and
also when the ce-5 contact app comes out
we&#39;ll all be able to form teams that
will do this all together so we can once
we&#39;re able to get out under the stars
together so there can be thousands of
teams all over the world and I can do
this for thousands of teams with
millions of people all at once and the
effect will have will be astonishing I
think all around you you will see the
emergence from the crossing point of
light and from infinity these
civilizations and peoples joining us as
we create a new civilization a new world
thank you very much god bless you all
and I hope to see you guys again soon
bye bye thank you
