well I&#39;d like to welcome all of you here
to the Institute of noetic sciences and
thank you to the staff and people here
for letting us use this facility
beautiful grounds wonderful being up
here again and it&#39;s really a very
special place the Earthrise retreat here
at ions I also want to thank all the
staff who are volunteering these are all
volunteer people thank all of you Lera
Rikki justice and everyone who&#39;s there
out there helping us with the program
today and I&#39;d like to also recognize and
thank lance and Christina who film crew
here who are doing our next feature film
which will be close encounters of the
fifth kind consciousness contact and the
human future so that should be done in
about a year and released globally so
that&#39;s very exciting they&#39;ve just gotten
engaged and we just got back off the
mountain from Mount Shasta last night
and amazing experiences there which
we&#39;ll go into a little bit well I was
here quite some many I can&#39;t remember
when it was in the 1990s and a man that
founded the Institute of noetic Sciences
Edgar Mitchell oh I got to know over the
years and I was sort of the person who
brought him into this subject of the
interstellar question and he actually I
invited him to come with me to the
Pentagon in 1997 in the spring of that
year when we briefed the head of
intelligence Joint Chiefs of Staff
Admiral Tom Wilson so dr. Mitchell was
there with me as were some of my
military advisors and witnesses all the
way back from the Eisenhower era to the
current period as of that date and it
was really exciting to introduce dr.
Mitchell to this subject since he was
the sixth man to walk on the moon
which in sort of full-circle
synchronicity my oldest uncle worked on
the lunar module that landed on the moon
that was the vehicle that took the
astronauts there in the 60s and early
70s so it was really a wonderful time
interesting era and we think of Edgar
and his in the worlds of light which is
now he&#39;s exploring all of it without the
encumbrance of the physical cage which
is quite beautiful as well to think
contemplate so what we&#39;re going to be
doing today is to go through the
structure of the cosmos how that relates
to higher states of consciousness and
the development of consciousness and
then the correlation of those states of
consciousness with levels of
civilization that we have contact with
at this point and increasing levels of
contact through the Close Encounters of
the fifth kind initiative which is the
initiative to make peaceful contact with
these civilizations utilizing the
science of consciousness and a set of
protocols that sort of got developed
when I was 18 years old and had a
contact experience up in the mountains
of North Carolina back in those days so
what we want to do is go through this
very methodically I&#39;ve created some
graphs for you guys which I hope will be
useful learning tools to understand this
because it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;ll seem
overwhelming initially but we&#39;ll go back
over it as much as we can we have four
hours today here and I also want to
welcome by the way all the folks who are
coming in by webinar they&#39;re a few
thousand people be watching by webinar
today who can&#39;t be here personally so
welcome so it if we can go to the first
slide and this is
I came up with this it&#39;s very hard to
put into a two-dimensional format the
holographic conscious universe but this
is an attempt and what you&#39;ll see is in
the very center is this pure
consciousness inner unbounded state that
is at the base line filled consciousness
that is non-local omnipresent and which
has been scientifically shown to be
omnipresent non-local and this work
that&#39;s been done by dr. John at
Princeton with the Princeton engineering
anomalies Research Lab a Dean Radin has
done a lot of pioneering work in
consciousness who&#39;s now here at no
excises there has been a growing body of
science that shows that the conscious
field itself is not bound by space-time
brainwave activity the body etc and so
on and in fact in effect mechanical
systems you can put your thought on a
random number generator to generate more
zeros and ones or vice-versa and it&#39;ll
do that right before 9/11 there was a
big spike collectively on a precognitive
level of collective unconscious that
occurred just before that event hook
took place you may know about that
research so people often connect through
consciousness as it relates to their
individuality this is the transpersonal
transcendent level of consciousness that
is the base line consciousness that is
not bound by space-time individuality
etc and so on and yet what&#39;s interesting
about the nature of this into inner
unbounded state is that that state of
consciousness is present equally at
every point in space and time
it can&#39;t be divided up it&#39;s an
indivisible State and so all of you
right now who are hearing my voice
you&#39;re sitting awake in your bodies
presumably here present that conscious
mind that is allowing you to be aware
and awake consenting
is let&#39;s look at it this way and ray of
that infinite unbounded field that we&#39;re
identifying with ourselves but the
reality of it is that it is always
unbounded so the experience of that
state of unboundedness has been called
Samadhi or Nirvana or in Christian early
times be the beatific state etc and so
on however it&#39;s actually always
operative and it&#39;s operative whether we
acknowledge it or not and that&#39;s the
wellspring of intuition and people who
have precognitive dreams that&#39;s because
in the dream state you&#39;re a little more
released from linear space-time and you
can go into a state which we&#39;ll call the
astral visual state and see an event
that&#39;ll happen the next day or the next
year so the only reason any of that&#39;s
possible is the nature of the spirit of
consciousness in its non-local aspect
but just remember it&#39;s an aspect that&#39;s
there in its fullness at every point in
space and time within all space and time
and matter and is not bound so it&#39;s a in
a sense of paradox
it&#39;s omnipresent and unbounded and yet
its present and its fullness at every
point in space and time and therefore
it&#39;s accessible at every point in space
and time this makes sense but lost
people yet I hope not most of you or
meditators and understand consciousness
pretty well so so that that part of it
is is really important to realize and
this is why when they&#39;ve done studies it
was done back and published in
mainstream physics journals that they
could put a photon down a beam photon
beam and the person around the
experiment would think the change the
opening the photon was going to go
through and it would pre cognitively
change photons so the idea here is that
everything has a connection to
consciousness and from consciousness
thought and intent
now when we&#39;re talking about just a
natural order of things
this has been known by shamans and
mystics and people throughout human
history what we&#39;re now finding in
scientific research is these are
reproducible engineering studies that
can be done like dr. John started at the
Princeton engineering anomalies Research
Lab and others have done with biological
systems bruce lipton and others but the
key thing is understand it so make it
complicated because you&#39;re awake right
now if you&#39;re aware if you can become
aware of that awareness it&#39;s sort of a
Zen process to subtract all the
phenomenon of your thoughts your
perceptions your body it&#39;s like all not
this take remove all the ephemera all
the passing perceptions fault even your
individuality and just reflect on the
state of being consciousness that&#39;s all
it is it&#39;s really all it is now having
that experience is beautiful and
enlightening and liberating and blissful
and all of that and that&#39;s why
meditation techniques exist but just
remember those are techniques that&#39;s not
the end it&#39;s a means to the end this is
but this is always there so once we
understand that we are not limited any
individual in space or time but there&#39;s
a perfect field of unbounded a
consciousness that can be accessed and
that&#39;s what no matter what we&#39;re doing
then it&#39;s incredibly liberating
empowering and that&#39;s the whole process
of self actualization and then we could
go on all day about that but you know
and what the techniques are and the
kinds of experiences and we&#39;ll touch on
that in a moment
now as this as the unbounded let&#39;s call
it the unbounded field of absolute pure
consciousness as undifferentiated begins
to differentiate there are phases our
aspects of it as it does that the first
of which is the thought
this the sound component of thought
which by the way a mantra is simply the
sound component of a thought or chanting
or what have you and the sound component
of a thought at the level of unbounded
coming from that first emanation from
the field or the plane of the absolute
if you wish to look at it that way is
has been called at various things the
primal thought and it has within it the
tonality and thought essence of
everything that exists in the cosmos
whether it is physical whether it is in
the spirit world
astral we&#39;ll get into this in a moment
all of that emanates and this is why you
know of course it gets turned into sort
of metaphors and allegories in the
beginning there was the word and the
Word was with God etcetera and so on the
word is it mean a word like water bottle
apologize for using these plastic
bottles we should have something else
anyway but nevertheless there that is
the key thing to understand is that it
the undifferentiated unbounded mind has
to have stepped down transformers let&#39;s
call it phases of manifestation all the
way to the entire cosmos galaxies star
systems your body yourselves so that
first emanation which is experience is
this primal thought causal tonality that
it then differentiates further you see
that the arrows are going both ways for
a reason because you can it can come
from in or out or from the external in
in terms of an experience is that
there&#39;s the causal thought resonant
tonality realm that unique to each
created thing and that&#39;s where every
blade of grass and every grain of sand
and every body and every individual has
its own tonality music essence that is
more fundamental although this sounds
very abstract as a thought essence that
it has tonality associated with it that
even precedes so called the body of
light the astral body that you might
experience in a lucid dream or an astral
projection or a near-death experience
we&#39;ll get to this in a moment none of
this is foreign because everyone&#39;s
experienced this at some point in their
life and or when you pass away you will
so I&#39;m giving you a glimpse to your
future because none of us make it out of
this world alive trust me as an
emergency doctor so you may think you do
we&#39;re born we live and we pass on but so
you will experience that now many people
do not exponentially experience this
this and this or the next one this next
phase let&#39;s call it is the emanation of
the pure light form so it&#39;s been called
mystically the most great light and some
would say it would be the expressed
aspect that one could see of the Creator
being if you will and the great light
you see when you pass away and have a
near-death experience
so that first emanation is beautiful
those of us who&#39;ve how many people had a
near-death experience I had a very
detailed one which we&#39;ll get into if you
wish so that emanation of the pure light
form is if you will
corollary to the primal thought the
essence of the primal thought that has
within it the complexity in tonality of
an infinite number of expressions in a
similar like way all forms that are
visual are contained within the
emanation of that most pure light being
or poor that expression of the unbounded
then you get into more specific
elaborations and expressions of that
state which would be
for example the divine avatars that have
been variously identified through
history whether it&#39;s Christ or Buddha or
Krishna etc this celestial realm angelic
astral worlds of light the afterlife and
other dimensions in other other
dimensions we&#39;ll get into in a moment
because that has a great deal to do with
what we&#39;re talking about today of
transdimensional interstellar
civilizations now when you have this
many people have experienced something
at this level where they&#39;ve had a lucid
dream where you&#39;re flying in the dream
how many people had a flying lucid dream
in your life where almost everybody in
reality that&#39;s your light body that&#39;s
actually going on a little trip it&#39;s
taking a little journey now most people
think oh I just had a dream and most
dreams are just that but the really
clear lucid dreams you&#39;re awake in the
dream and often you&#39;ll be flying it&#39;s
beautiful and you&#39;re actually utilizing
this body of light that has within it
your essence of your individuality the
thought expression that&#39;s the sound
component of the thought it&#39;s been
called Alisha Vidya in the sanskrit
talked about this more later
what Leisha Vidya really is and then
from there the expression you can
explore anywhere because you&#39;re not
bound by your physical body you can go
out in space you can go over the ocean
you can go under the ocean and meet
dolphins or you can go and see an
ancestor in the worlds of light the
astral and all almost all humans have
experienced some aspect of this during
the dream state or a deep meditative
state or in the hypnagogic going in and
out of sleep between sleep and waking
States that is interesting because I
like telling this story is it&#39;s
apocryphal but it&#39;s interesting because
one time I took my wife and I for our
anniversary or in have our 39th
anniversary next month hard to believe
but thirty nine freakish years being
with me anyway they&#39;re quite a journey
we yeah we met forty years ago this past
April in Israel but I was introduced to
her in a lucid dream before I met her
physically you know may know this story
from hidden truth forbidden knowledge a
book I wrote about all that but one time
we went to Costa Rica and we were at
right by the ocean beautiful Pacific
coast
really beautiful area pure nature which
is why I wanted to do this up here in
nature you have more of the positive
energy that&#39;s life-supporting for
consciousness and thought and so we&#39;re
we were sleeping and what she saw she
woke up and she&#39;s not at all let&#39;s just
say mystically inclined all that much
but she she woke up and looked over and
she saw sort of this silvery grayish
form sit up out of my body and fly out
the window and she&#39;s laying there then
we have four little kids four daughters
and she&#39;s there in bed thinking oh great
now I&#39;m in Costa Rica steve is dead of a
heart attack and I&#39;m gonna be a widow
and the kids are thousands of miles away
well what I was experiencing is that I
went into this lucid dream state and was
flying over the coastline and seeing
everything as if it was daytime but even
clearer like a celestial aspect of the
earth the beauty of the ocean and the
forest and of the life of Gaia it was
beautiful and I was doing this I was
just having fun and then I come back and
the quote Dream Inns and I feel
someone&#39;s looking at me and I look over
and she&#39;s looking at me she says you&#39;re
back I said where have I gone I didn&#39;t
go anywhere
she says you did and she described him
what she saw I said oh no I was just
having a lucid precognitive the flying
dream no precognition in that one but
that was this great example because
there was a
witness to the launch let&#39;s call it of
the spirit body J and it was just a
normal lucid flying dream for me but she
got to actually see it although it was
disturbing because she thought I had
passed away so you need to understand
that this is nothing this is not beyond
the experience and the reach and the
knowledge of every sentient being on
earth and in the cosmos not just on
earth but universally so in that sense
let&#39;s demystify it own it and say this
is normal this isn&#39;t all of this is
folded within us and is normal now the
extraordinary levels of experience might
be an after life near-death experience
and okay and an afterlife experience
when you&#39;ve had a near-death I know when
I had mine in 1973 you know you may know
this story I&#39;ll just share it just go
that&#39;s kind of funny
we&#39;re not funny it shows you the kind of
character I&#39;ve always been I&#39;m 17 I was
raised in a very poor family had my own
apartment in high school put myself
through high school college medical
school and you know since we have no
healthcare system in this country I&#39;m a
medical doctor saying this I was poor
had no health insurance and whatever I
got very sick I injured my left leg and
being the jock that I was bicycle 200
miles to the North Carolina coast with
this injury it got terribly infected and
200 miles back by the time I get back
I&#39;m really sick and I had sepsis which
is bacterial infection of the blood I
had a pad array no syndrome and where
the kidneys and liver start shutting
down and your urine looks like coca-cola
now I know all this now as an emergency
doctor at the time on this 17 year old
kid going oh well whatever you know how
guys are so I&#39;m there were like a
hundred and five degree temperature and
then poof my code I have a near-death
experience by myself in my little room
studio apartment I had in high school
and I launched okay so my great love was
always space
and the cosmos and I was raised a very
devout atheist we were the catechisms of
atheism there is no afterlife there is
no Great Spirit there is no soul you
have your physical life it&#39;s all
intellect if it&#39;s not in a test-tube it
doesn&#39;t exist full stop which is the
reductionist materialist model that&#39;s
the dominant paradigm in our society at
least in academic respectable circles
okay so I had this experience without
any sort of predilection or religious
training where I was supposed to meet
this angry ocher known as God with a
beard judging you you know at the pearly
gates with all that so none of that was
in my consciousness thank God and so I
just go straight into this state of
cosmic consciousness I did not have I
stripped away even my astral body of
light and I was in this resonant
tonality body the causality just pure
thought essence without the form of my
body and during that time I had a
meeting with to what had been called
divine avatars you know sort of the
highest expressions of the Godhead and
Great Spirit in space I was out amongst
two cosmos and ended up having this
beautiful experience and experienced all
this from the pure infinite
consciousness all the way to the whole
cosmos and the experience that I was
that that all of us are that that at
that deep level of experience there is
one beam were it were all one being and
it was crystal clear was not it was no
intellectualization that I was a direct
experience now Here I am this kid had no
foundation for this really in my
education or experience where certainly
was I wasn&#39;t raised in a family with
voodoo and crystals and meditation and
saris and head turbans and ashrams and
Yogi&#39;s or anything like that
I&#39;m not making fun of those things I&#39;m
just saying I was in the south in a poor
family didn&#39;t know anything about this
stuff and this happens was the way was
good because I was able to experience it
untrammeled by the preconceived ideas
some of which are good and some of which
are not so good so it was this beautiful
beautiful experience and I literally
experienced every level of this from
unbounded mine
to the entirety of the infinity of
cosmos so that afterlife experience
which many people have had a near-death
experience depends on how far it goes I
was out quite some time and for some
reason had the adventuresome nest to go
as far as you could go in it until
there&#39;s a beautiful experience also with
these two points of pure consciousness
that were these divine avatar beans and
we sort of had a oneness experience and
a lot of interesting nonverbal non
visual packets of knowledge just sort of
came to me it was very spontaneous like
a pump a stream and I don&#39;t know how
long that lasted at the end of which it
was said to me you need to either come
with us now or go back and I said well I
mean let&#39;s see poverty torture illness
the earth this celestial level of
experience but I had enough presence of
mind to say what is your will like thy
will be done and it was said very
clearly we&#39;d like for you to go back
today which point I was very depressed
and I was unhappy but I did come back
otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be standing here
right so I came back I know back in my
body and during that experience was a
bit as the part of it the only part that
was scary is that I sort of awakened in
consciousness in my body I had sensory
input
I could hear I can I could see I could
see the maple tree Oh
outside my window in front of the
streetlight moving shadows and I get but
I couldn&#39;t move I was paralyzed
so this was this post near-death brief
paralysis but I didn&#39;t understand it I
thought oh great now I&#39;m a quadriplegic
and I&#39;m bad it turns out it took after a
little while my neural connections were
made and I was able to stand up and do
whatever interestingly this terrible
injury I had part of my left thigh
missing it&#39;s a big indented area where
the muscle was eaten away I never did
get antibiotics or treatment I
spontaneously broke the fever and was
healed the next day so after this
experience it was a spontaneous healing
also part of this I should have gone to
see a doctor but I didn&#39;t anyway
the universal care of it and here we are
so that&#39;s that experience many many
thousands millions of people have had
near-death experiences a huge body of
research on it which I&#39;m sure many of
you are familiar with and their
different experiences people have but
that&#39;s something that is all within us
and we experience in different ways at
the time that we leave our physical
bodies here now this is where it gets
interesting because it&#39;s this is where
the most of this is pretty well
understood historically from ancient
teachings that they does a Sanskrit the
various sutra this is this is pretty
well understood has been since the dawn
of the human exists exists on this
planet what sounds new and which is
going to be a little more complex is how
these other dimensions and these finest
aspects of the astral and thought and
consciousness phase into the courser
aspects of astral white consciousness
through the interface what I call the
gap into linear 3d space time matter
what is normally called the cosmos now
the cosmos
as we see it and have been had it told
us by astronomers is only this this
outer gray ring space-time galaxies this
planet the material world etc in reality
all of this every one of these dime
aspects is folded within and present in
its fullness at every point of this and
vice versa they&#39;re accessible there&#39;s no
barrier to entry except our thought it&#39;s
the constructs of belief it&#39;s the
constructs of thought it&#39;s the education
mis-education lack of education that
makes us think it&#39;s all separate you
know Native American people thought was
very strange when they first met people
from the West because they had this view
of being separate from the sky father
sky and mother earth and all of this and
what we called primitive civilizations
most of these civilizations had an
understanding
it was articulated differently perhaps
from this but you will find this is a
universal understanding where there is
the shamans or the aboriginals with
Dreamtime or the ancient vedic teachers
and in the himalayas etc and so on so
all of that is folded within every one
of us and at every point of space-time
but also every intelligent being in the
cosmos this is going to get important
right here but we tend to be very
narcissistic as a people and the sort of
self referencing this sort of
anthropocentric projection where we
think we&#39;re the only thing in the
universe but also were the only beings
that would have these kinds of
experiences in reality any sentient
intelligent life form anywhere in
existence has all of this open to them
and within them and can be experienced
and eventually can be discovered
scientifically which is what we&#39;re on
the verge of doing on our civilization
with the science of consciousness
studies but then that gets extrapolated
and developed and define more and more
and more into scientific systems so you
know instead of having this with a radio
frequency this is on a fault frequency
you think to it it turns on it does
something we&#39;ll get into this in the
mode that&#39;s the interstellar level all
civilizations capable of going beyond
what are normally described as the
limits of space-time and the like
barrier speed of light by definition
have mastered technologically both in
transportation systems as well as
communication systems transdimensional
physics which is what we&#39;re we&#39;re gonna
go in a moment there&#39;s a purpose to all
this I&#39;m trying to lay a foundation so
you can understand the rest of this and
I hope I haven&#39;t lost you yet there&#39;ll
be time for questions the what I call
the gap interface is very important to
understand and that is how does what is
the relationship between these other
dimensions spirit world the astral
energy fields the thought realms
consciousness and 3d material objects
the cosmos the planet your body yourself
how those remote healing work where
people put their awareness on someone
and say a prayer and intercession your
prayer and it has an effect why does
that work it&#39;s because every point in
space and time and every person has all
of this cosmos holographically folded
within it&#39;s not a linear this is written
out linearly but just forget the
linearity okay
it&#39;s not even nonlinear it&#39;s nonlocality
so in physics no Einstein described the
spooky effect where the same particle
would be in two places at wants that
sort of thing entanglement as it&#39;s been
called some of you heard about this and
physics is beginning to push into this
nonlocality
and it&#39;s where you begin to get the
understanding that used to be relegated
to the Mystics into post quantum let&#39;s
call it physics and the science of
consciousness is the intersection of
those two okay now we have explored all
this in various times in human history
but in ways that perhaps weren&#39;t
intellectually or academically
understood they were more experiential
now we&#39;re getting to the point where we
can set up experimental models like dr.
Raiden&#39;s been doing and dr. John did
until his passing of studying that and
the effects of it otherwise how is it
that you could be sitting in a room put
your awareness on a random number
generator and affect the outcome more
zeros and ones or more ones and zeros
interestingly if you have two people who
love each other or United the effect is
exponential and not just linear so
there&#39;s this aspect of the being bonded
in oneness because the highest
expression of love is oneness this state
you can call it pure love you can also
can see it as oneness because if you
want to if you love someone you want to
be with someone is that make magnetic
force very powerful what we call love
now there&#39;s sentimental love there&#39;s
inter human love but there&#39;s this let&#39;s
call it divine aspect of love or this
transcendent aspect of love and that&#39;s
very operative in the cosmos beautiful
this gap between that this interplay
between the three-dimensional cosmos and
all of the consciousness tonality astral
and what I call mere astral things that
are how is it that your body of light
interfaces with your physical body for
example what&#39;s what&#39;s let&#39;s get on a
granular almost reductionist level of
scientific inquiry here you all have
this experience of lucid dreaming you
have a body of light and this inner
thoughts essence and consciousness
unbounded win this window into the
unbounded field through your own portal
let&#39;s call it each of you is a Stargate
from that point of view into infinity
each and every individual is a Stargate
into this infinite realm and to any
point in space and time which you can
experience so people say oh do I have to
create a portal or story I said you are
a portal and a Stargate you need to know
who you are
and once you realize who you are you can
access all of this here within it&#39;s all
there it&#39;s all folded within so this
enfold materially important to
understand and yet there is a very
specific scientific articulation let&#39;s
call it connection between these realms
that can be scientifically developed and
dare I use the word routinized made
routine those are the interstellar
civilizations that&#39;s what they&#39;ve
already accomplished if they hadn&#39;t been
able to accomplish that they couldn&#39;t go
from one star system to another one
galaxy to another so this is getting
into the transdimensional interstellar
TD is level of the physics I want to get
into today have I lost folks yet you can
with me so far okay good
so winged y&#39;all ready for this we just
getting started honey okay well I am a
child of the south now the North
Carolina interesting place to developed
on this planet
oh boy now when we can entertain how
does all of this let&#39;s call it as well
as other dimensions the spirit world
higher and lower dimensions of the
astral some would call you go all the
way from angelic celestial enlightened
to things that people might experience
that are kind of bugging me and spooky
to things that are just prosaic but
still considered creepy like the guy who
died in my trauma one level we had a big
trauma place and this do doctors see a
lot of stuff they don&#39;t talk about
because we&#39;re not supposed to talk about
it because then you&#39;re not a scientist
what nonsense get over yourselves all
you academics time to grow up
childhoods in you can quote me on that
but I was there we had a man come in and
it was a multi-system trauma from he was
murdered and he had been intoxicated and
we couldn&#39;t save him he passed away and
a few hours later like at 3:00 or 4:00
in the morning I was there in the in the
central area and had all these trauma
rooms and stuff and it was for one
second quiet no one was in there and I&#39;m
there with the nurses in the unit clerk
her secretary and all of a sudden the
room in which he had passed away there
was all this racket the cabinet&#39;s flew
open IV bags were thrown on the floor
the IV pump was turned on the EKG
machine was turned up this this spirit
of this guy that it passed through it
was in a rage absolutely and that&#39;s been
called poltergeist he&#39;s sort of weird
phenomena that&#39;s real now don&#39;t be
afraid of it all I did I went into this
state I just checked in here in all
these realms connected to that soul
connected him to that most great light
and it ended he went on his way that you
can do that very easily
not hard see what I&#39;m saying just do it
like that
of course the nurse is new I
done then they said dr. Greer&#39;s a
warlock I said well thank you we had fun
love those hillbilly nurses in North
Carolina we didn&#39;t have fun so that
experience you know that sort of one
extreme experience of this interface
where an astral body pushes in to this
dimension you see what I&#39;m saying but
now imagine if you&#39;re let&#39;s say you&#39;re
from a planet on a galaxy far far away
where&#39;s George Lucas this place not too
far and and you&#39;re from a galaxy far far
our way contrary to how the movies
portray it you don&#39;t get your phasers
out and you&#39;re don&#39;t speed up - no no no
no you create a resonant field around
whatever material object it is at a
certain frequency in resonance very high
voltage that thing looks like it&#39;s D
materialized and vanished it&#39;s actually
this called vibrationally or resonantly
and as all electronics high-end
electronics boom goes into the gap and
the near astral and therefore it&#39;s no
longer has mass it no longer has the
limits of the physical universe as has
been described because it is operating
in the near astral gap interface that
allows this whether it&#39;s poltergeists or
near-death experience or you to be in a
lucid dream there&#39;s this interwoven
Ness of that realm in other dimensions
into the physical and if you have
scientifically elaborated and understood
this to the point of very fine
transdimensional physics and
electromagnetic and electronic systems
you can go from point A to B in the
cosmos almost that fast it&#39;s not quite
instantaneous because there&#39;s a
co-efficiency of drag I call it like you
do with a car in a wind tunnel
as it skirts along the underbelly of the
3d cosmos does that make sense so let me
take a month to go a million light-years
a month corrected for Earth time this is
make sense a little bit we&#39;ll get into
this more in a moment so then you have
also communication systems so always
tell this funny story of you know I&#39;m
briefing the director of the CIA and the
cover story for that is a dinner party
so the wives are invited this is this is
ninety three very chauvinistic very
politically incorrect even in a red
state and but the wives were there to
make it look like a legitimate dinner
party because there was a head of a
think tank who has a board that the CI
Director had been on in me and then the
wives were invited at a dinner party at
the private home of the think-tank
director and of course I was the person
presenting so this was Bill Clinton CIA
director our james Woolsey who tried to
deny the meeting luckily I have the
letter approves him the lawyer always
say in Washington oh they&#39;re lying their
lips are moving if their lips are moving
they&#39;re lying in a discussion now you
can move on so at any rate how cynical
true but so we have this meeting well
interestingly we get into some really
deep stuff very quickly and it wasn&#39;t
coming from the director of the CIA he
was where a policy person he just didn&#39;t
understand why the president and he were
being denied access to these
unacknowledged special access projects
in fact he didn&#39;t know that you PSAPs
existed which is the whole documentary
on acknowledge which I&#39;m sure most of
you have seen its number-one documentary
in the last year on Netflix and iTunes
and elsewhere but in a world yeah even
though the mainstream media tried the
blacklist it it just took off people are
ready to hear this
so the CI directors wife turns to me and
says how are they communicating
across these vast distances of space
because you know we think we&#39;re all
get-out with these little gadgets it&#39;s
really rubbish
this is 1844 radio frequency it&#39;s no
let&#39;s not get carried away all those you
work in Silicon Valley you got a lot of
growing up to do
so we&#39;ll have a talk if there any tech
people here here pull me aside you can
pick my brain you can move to the next
level quickly if you&#39;ve got the cojones
to do it now that&#39;s really what it is
I&#39;ll tell you right now it&#39;s courage and
vision and integrity courage vision
integrity that&#39;s all you need we have a
new civilization here tomorrow it&#39;s all
here
so what&#39;s beautiful though is that she
had the perspective to say and she was
the chief operating officer of the
National Academy of Sciences which is a
very prestigious mainstream scientific
entity probably the most prestigious in
the country if not the world and so she
said how are they communicating across
these vast distances because at the
speed of light but one of these things
let&#39;s say you&#39;re only a thousand
light-years from here and that&#39;s the
that&#39;s the distance of one percent of
the way through our own galaxy the Milky
Way
the next closest galaxy is two and a
half million light-years so it would
take two and a half million years at the
speed of light to get a signal to
Andromeda and two-and-a-half million
years more for them to say yeah I got
your signal how you doing today that&#39;s
five million years so any interstellar
civilization per force by definition are
required to be transdimensional if their
interstellar now people have said I
remember I was here at the noetic
Sciences with Jacques Vallee said well
these things aren&#39;t extraterrestrial
they&#39;re interdimensional I&#39;m going to
whoo yeah boy it&#39;s like saying an orange
is round but it&#39;s not orange and another
guy arguing it&#39;s orange but it&#39;s not
round it&#39;s orange and round all right
all interstellar civilizations are
transdimensional
all they have to be you cannot so I
explained this to the director of the
CIA wife he was at this point I think I
lost him
I moved off of policy and black budgets
and unacknowledged special access
projects in the agency that were lying
to him and the president and all that
stuff into this which seemed like the
realm of the mystic but it isn&#39;t it&#39;s
the realm of the cutting edge of science
the science of consciousness as well and
I say it look they have two things
operating they have technology assisted
consciousness so they have technology
that assists our consciousness that
remote viewing precognition and
communication but they also have
consciousness that assists their
technologies for the guidance and the
direction of their spacecraft and things
like this so it&#39;s see AT&amp;T AC I wrote a
paper about this in 1991 they went all
through the CIA an aerospace upper-end
of Lockheed skunk works and and
McDonnell Douglas at the time and
Northrop Grumman my uncle&#39;s old company
was north of Grumman and they went
people went how do you know this I said
cuz I had that experience I went there
and when I had my first contact
experience it was on that basis so
that&#39;s how I learned it I learned it
directly and experientially the
experiences the great teacher so let&#39;s
have that experience together so the CIA
directors wife is going is listening and
I said because you really the speed of
light is just too damn slow it&#39;s too
slow for either communication or for
transportation and she looked at me she
says you know I knew it had to be
something like that she got it bang
right off and that was in December on
December 13th 1973 and I went that&#39;s
when I said I turn to my wife later I
said that means the world is ready to
hear this even if it&#39;s not supposed to
be spoken about in polite company
because this is the ex chief operating
officer of the National Academy Sciences
totally this is what she was expecting
the answer to be you see how important
that is it&#39;s sort of like that they&#39;re
sort of like milestones or litmus tests
I look for in civilization say are we
really ready for this or not or we
believe in the PR of the Cabal and the
people want to keep us stupid well I
don&#39;t want us
stupid it neither do you so we can just
forget about this control freaks so
bye-bye see wouldn&#39;t want to be you Mike
there you go that&#39;s it all right so now
what you have is an understanding you&#39;re
beginning to see how if you are an
interstellar civilizations way out in
space which by the way is also infinite
and eternal this is infinite and eternal
but so is the cosmos the astrophysicists
say that it&#39;s a limited size and we can
only see so far but that&#39;s just what I
call the near universe there&#39;s a pause
the vastness of empty space beyond what
we can detect and the continuation of
universe and universe uni means one you
can&#39;t say there&#39;s another universe
because that subverts the meaning of
universe one all this is in reality the
universe now our modern scientists and
astrophysicists and who is that Tyson
somebody to Grapher I don&#39;t know huh
yeah Neil deGrasse Tyson and all those
folks there they&#39;re limiting themselves
to a very narrow bandwidth not even all
of this all of this is omitted which
means that they&#39;re their operational
paradigm is fatally flawed and very much
just sort of more of a myth and the
truth
scientifically even because they will
not acknowledge the primacy of the
conscious quantum hologram that is the
cosmos and that is also each individual
each individual has all of this folded
within I&#39;ll give you one more little fun
story about the interface gap which
seems very foreign it isn&#39;t it&#39;s part of
look if you have a astral projection
experience or a lucid flying dream
somehow you integrate it separates and
then you integrate with your physical
body this body of light that has within
it the causality the thought essence of
yourself which is actually a tonality
and I see everyone has our own
song note or like it&#39;s infinitely
diverse and then that has unfolded
within it the entirety of this infinite
consciousness field all that every
there&#39;s that wonderful say and I think
it&#39;s from the Persian tradition thinkest
by self a puny form when within the the
universe is folded it Sackett Oracle
question you are not a puny thing all of
this is folded within each and every one
of us and each and every
extraterrestrial sentient being so I had
a man who is Lockheed skunkworks Kai he
he approached me to ask what he really
wanted to be a disclosure witness Don
Phillips he&#39;s in the materials and it
was about a radar in an encounter case
when he was in the military and then he
gone into work in the Lockheed
skunkworks the super-secret engineering
division of Lockheed Martin and he he
said to me you know the real reason I&#39;m
calling it&#39;s a little bit of a
transactional thing that happens with
these nearly 1,000 military and
intelligence witnesses that have come to
me because they want to be sure me
information from them being in a
classified project but they want to pick
my brain about this so he said back in
those days I was learning to I was part
of a group called the Royce of crucians
and I don&#39;t know what technique they use
but he was saying that he was being
taught to actually project and his
teacher he was going oh I can&#39;t he was
intellectualizing and overthinking it
too much man his teacher said look you
you have the ability to do this you know
everything you need to know just do it
just go ahead and do it so he goes home
lays on his bed does the technique and
just sort of with an impulse says I can
do this and he does so he he goes up
from his physical body and his body of
light goes through the roof the ceiling
of his house up into the atmosphere and
sees a UFO what he would used to be
called a UF
now let&#39;s go to UAP it&#39;s all fake words
is it was an extraterrestrial vehicle
ETV NSA column ETV no such thing as a
UAP or UFO they&#39;re not unidentified they
don&#39;t fly it&#39;s a nonsense and they&#39;re
certainly not unexplained aerial
phenomenon that&#39;s ball lightning okay so
at any rate these are all fake terms
made to colonize people&#39;s thoughts to
make you think we don&#39;t know what it is
when we do know what it is just remember
everything in the mainstream media&#39;s
rubbish so total rubbish you know fake
scientists fake news fake fake fake not
what necessarily the president says but
it&#39;s fake
so that&#39;s could be redacted redact but
let me just say this guy didn&#39;t
understand what happened because he he
understood consciousness and the astral
and all of that but when he went up to
this craft and he slammed against it and
it moved the craft it actually moved it
joggled it and then of course he kind of
popped inside there there was he ETS
that could occur standing at consoles
because there&#39;s a bio electric field and
that&#39;s how they&#39;re connecting
consciousness into the system and and
they look at him like my god why don&#39;t
you watch where you&#39;re going you know it
was like this interstellar faux pas and
diplomatic or a rude just pop right in
knock first but he said it was
embarrassing but what he couldn&#39;t
understand he knew it was a totally real
experience he didn&#39;t understand why his
astral body would have moved the craft I
said ah because it had quote-unquote
pop-culture term D materialized and it
was in the atmosphere wouldn&#39;t have been
seen with the naked eye or a radar
system and it was in this near astral 3d
gap hovering it could be one out here
right now you wouldn&#39;t see it you
wouldn&#39;t detect it no radar system and
no electronic system would detect it
except ones that are quite advanced that
are neutrino light astral systems that
are highly classified we&#39;ll get into
this later and so
those that experience taught him
something but he didn&#39;t know what it was
I said it&#39;s because when an interstellar
ship has shifted out of 3d and has gone
in to say vote for D 5 D 68 D 10 D or a
lot of dimensions it will be there but
it&#39;ll be there in a form and if your
physical astral body I&#39;ll come and
consider it physical it&#39;s not
metaphysical it&#39;s still physical
anything this side of unbounded pure
consciousness is relative and has
relativity of some type may not be
normal space-time attached to it the
density of your astral body and the
density of that craft shifted into that
frequency we&#39;re the same and that&#39;s why
they touched conversely you could take
something that you&#39;ve heard of masters
and in doing this take it a little bit
out of spin angular momentum this object
and make it go straight through my hand
it&#39;s not magic it&#39;s physics it&#39;s a
physics that we need to begin to
understand because that&#39;s what these ET
crafts are doing it&#39;s been relegated to
the mystic see here&#39;s the problem
we&#39;ve overly mystified things that were
at a stage for the last half century we
should have all known that&#39;s part of the
problem with secrecy or you know 50 to
100 years held back
educationally from what we should know
scientifically I&#39;m not talking about
just in consciousness had there been
disclosure of these facts back in the
40s 30s 40s 50s 60s but here we are 28
teen living like Neanderthals burning
oil in our cars to get up here all right
when we haven&#39;t needed that for since I
was alive and I ain&#39;t no spring chicken
I just turned 63 and I have eight
grandkids so what what what would you
realize with this this whole model is
that all of this is folded within us all
of it is folded within us but it also
means it can be scientifically accessed
if you have enough refined
science and refined technological
ability where you&#39;d assigns of
consciousness and the studies of that
where the interface between
consciousness thought so-called
causality and all astral energies begin
to come together with physical systems
now
interstellar civilizations as well as
highly classified projects in the United
States and elsewhere have have that and
we&#39;ll get into that in a moment but this
paradigm you need to first own and
comprehend before you know you can we
can go to this next understanding so
it&#39;s all this understood okay we can
move on
