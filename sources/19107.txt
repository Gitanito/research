we are
live here at the red carpet for close
encounters of the fifth kind and i&#39;ve
pulled him off his work
ron james was kind enough to stop by and
talk to us for a minute jake ron you&#39;ve
done the last two documentaries for dr
dave right
this will be the third so i i hosted the
red carpet for sirius and then i hosted
the red carpet for
unacknowledged and now i&#39;m doing it for
your third time which is kind of an
honor you know steven grier&#39;s work is
very very
important yeah we&#39;re going to do this in
april and then the copic thing
we had to cancel it because of kobe and
now we&#39;ll get here let&#39;s give folks an
idea of what you&#39;re doing here you got
the red carpet set up here
what&#39;s all these cameras and you want to
give guys an idea of what&#39;s happening
behind you here
sure so i&#39;ve set up the step and repeat
and we&#39;re setting up a hands-free
microphone for
audience members and people to come up
and talk to myself and dr greer
as soon as the live stream starts we&#39;re
shooting with three cameras so we have
the wide shot
and then a tighter shot for each
individual person that&#39;s
in front of the red carpet we set it up
so that we could socially distance and
play
it safe so uh you&#39;ll see people here
without masks but they&#39;re being careful
and we&#39;ve quartered off the whole area
because i know people are going to be
concerned about that yeah the second
they hit the doors you&#39;ve got to put a
mask on if they if you don&#39;t have a wall
that&#39;s in or to put one
so i watched the movie again last night
just to make sure that it was fresh in
my mind and i&#39;m looking forward to
asking dr greer a couple of really
interesting questions
i&#39;m thinking that this is really about
we&#39;ve already proven
that there is a non-human intelligence
engaging the human race we know this
any any legitimate court of law would
weigh the evidence and find in favor of
that concept
so now the question is what&#39;s next where
do we go from here
and dr grier&#39;s made a fantastic film it
kind of points us in the right direction
and the answer really is that we just
have to do what we already know we have
to do
as a species so yeah and and we have to
uh we have to evolve to the point
where we&#39;re not destructive we&#39;re not
destroying the planet we&#39;re not
destroying each other
and that will earn us our place in this
galactic family
yeah i mean it&#39;s all the common sense
things that the sages and the spiritual
teachers have told us for
centuries and now the et&#39;s are telling
us the same thing
and it&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s going to
get us past this precipice that we&#39;re
currently on
absolutely so we&#39;re going to have the
red carpet right here dr greer himself
will be here as you said yes and we&#39;ve
got people from the movie people that
worked on the movie the director will be
here we&#39;ll all be coming through the
line here yes and you&#39;ll be hearing from
all of them right before
the opening speech by dr greer in the
theater which will also be streaming
perfect we&#39;ll check back in with you
guys in a little bit
