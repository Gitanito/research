Actual clinical death occurred twice. The first time was during the two hour ride to the hospital, in the ambulance. This event is not as clear in my memory, and it's very hard to relay. 

The second event is still very clear, and happened on the operating table. I have a hard time putting it in words but here goes. 

All sound and vision slowly closed in and eventually stopped altogether, both at once. A feeling of great relief and a knowledge that everything would be all right came to me. I am not a person who ever feels much joy or happiness, but that is what it must be like - total bliss with absolute peace. The event ended similarly to the way it started, only opposite. Slowly a white noise static type sound began and got louder and louder until a feeling of a thud. Then I came back. 

This is certainly not as glamorous as some death experience but is 100% true. I hope it helps any research.
