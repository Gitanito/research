  		              		Experience Description   

    I had a motorbike accident almost 4 years ago.  I don't rememeber anything, but would like to tell you what I said after the medically-induced coma.  I was conscious when they took me to the hospital in the ambulance. At the hospital, I clinically died, was  revived, and placed into a medically-induced  coma.

   On waking up, I told my parents that I had seen people who I didn't know. They  were calling me to go with them and then  they were  in the room calling me.

   My friend had died in that accident. Although I didn't remember anything, I had told my parents that my friend had come to visit me. Years later, I had visions. For example, I saw a white light going across the dining room and people running through the door of the room. I could  hear footsteps and breathing. I heard my name called loudly in my ear and  felt a presence at my side. It was as if they were staring at me and I was on my own.
