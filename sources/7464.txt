  		              		Experience Description   

    In the last three to four years, I had an exstreme life-changing experience. I'm not sure if it was a near death experience or astral contact with ET's. A series of events led me to believe I might have died. 

  I was recently divorced from my husband. We had a violent relationship.  Like most domestic violence relationships, it only gets worse. I upset him so much that he ended up strangling me. The first time it happened, I had never been so scared.  I could not understand where I was and what had happened. Instead of leaving like I should have done, I loved him and thought things would get better.

 The second and last time it happened, I had an unexplainable experience. My husband at the time, said I had been unconscious for fifteen minutes. When I did come around, he said that I immediately starting talking about what I saw. Unlike the first time when I was afraid, this time was different.  I had never felt so loved and protected.  It was like ecstasy.  That is the closest word to how I felt. I also remember being in an enclosed space like a room.  The glow of the light was perfect. The light was on the wall about five inches from the ceiling. I also remember seeing four entities around me. They were tall with blond hair and seemed to be in robe-like outfits. 

This experience led me to find answers about life after death.

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What importance did you place on your religious/spiritual life prior to your experience?         Not important to me  

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Other Christian   I always knew there was something much more powerful then myself, but I was always questioning about God being real. This was primarily due to all the hate and hurt in the world.

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I love the knowledge and truth about what the humans don't really know. I just thought they took it a little far with the wake-up call. Like dying by car crash, or whatever led me to the truth. Instead of going through such a heart-breaking experience when your spouse makes the decision to take the life of someone you love.  
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     That the truth has been kept secret, for selfish reasons and control.

I feel this is due to World War III, a nuclear war that the planet or mankind can't come back from.  
  
The experience included:       Presence of Unearthly Beings

Many people died and dies wanting to live. Even children that deserved to be here, more then me. Because I didn't want to feel the pain anymore. Pain is knowledge I have learned from that experience.
