  		              		Experience Description   

    I was 16 years old. I  had been admitted for general surgery to remove four teeth that had grown through the roof of my mouth. 
  
  I was taken down to the operating room. There were two nurses in attendance and an anesthesiologist.  All were fully gowned so I could not see their faces.  I was sedated. 
  
  At some point during the surgery, my heart stopped and I stopped breathing. Then I became conscious. 
  
  I was floating.  There  was no ceiling or walls. But, there was an  arched structure that was possibly a tunnel. I was aware of the light energy being bent around me,  although this was not a conscious thought at the time. 
  
  The light was excessively bright. If I had seen this on earth,  it would have burnt my retinas. But it was the most beautiful light and it did not hurt at all. In fact, I would say it was as soft as it was bright.
  
  I did not exist as a body, but was energy. I was an energy that was joined to all other energies; those that had been before and those that will be after. I became aware that we are all just energy and we are all intrinsically linked. 
  
  I recall no sound. Communication was or would have been via telepathy or just knowing; just knowing feels more appropriate. 
  
  There is no human word for how amazing and peaceful this state of being feels. I felt like this earth does not exist, nor does anyone in it. If they did exist, I'd be linked to them via energy because we are all one.
  
    This place was familiar, like  I had been here before. I may  have even come from here. 
  
  I did not want to come back, but was made to come back.  I felt myself being pulled back to the operating room. I did not want to come back. I did not want to leave that perfect feeling.
  
  I was then on the ceiling of the operating theatre, looking down on the proceedings. There were more people in the room. I could see a girl fighting with them as they tried to bring her back to life.  The machines would bring her back with a shock and then she'd kick and punch at them. Then the machines would show her still and lifeless form again. I recall thinking she was a rude and bad girl. I saw her punch a nurse in the face and sprain another nurse's wrist. 
  
   I realized the girl was me when I was no longer separate from her. I recalled nothing until I woke up the next day.   I asked if I had died and was told someone would come to talk to me. Nobody came to talk with me. 
   
  Then there was a nurse who came onto the ward and I asked, 'How is your wrist?' She said, 'Still sore. How did you know about that?' I said, 'Well, I did it. I saw myself.' She replied, 'You're right, you did.' We talked some more and she confirmed that I had to be resuscitated midway through the surgery.
  
  Since that time, no watches would work on me. My heart rate has been erratic.

  This experience  caused me to became exceedingly empathic, picking up on others' feelings and fears. I have had three of four clear premonitions, but on the whole, I know stuff about people,  their motivations and intent. I know what is missing from files and information. So much so,  that others question how I can know this stuff on a regular basis. 
  
  Either shortly before or shortly after this experience I attempted to kill myself.  I can't quite remember the timing. I was told not to talk about  it, so  I tried to bury the experience for many years.
    
    My mother asked me, while heavily sedated and on her deathbed, if heaven existed because I told her  I had been there. I found this odd,  as it was not something we talked about and she frowned upon it as she was a devout Christian. I told her it would be whatever she believed it to be and it would also be better than anything she could imagine. 

    My father asked me on his deathbed, if it was his choice when to die. I told him it was his choice and he died within 10 minutes after that. At the time of his death, he was clearly having 'silent' conversations with entities I could not see in the room. I had gone to check on him.  I thought I heard him and my partner having a conversation. My father was the only one in the room. My partner was asleep in another room. The second person was nowhere to be seen. Yet my father was awake. We had been told he probably had a few months to live. However, I knew I had to stay awake that night. 

    I was aware of my grandmother's death prior to it being called. My grandmother subsequently visited me after her death in 1979 when I was 10 years old.

    After my NDE incident, I had a vision of my grandfather who died when I was 2 years old.   I was able to fully describe the house that he lived in and other family members who were by then deceased.     I was aware of my grandfather's death prior to us being contacted about it.

    Date NDE Occurred:   	 1985    

    NDE Elements:         

    At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Uncertain    Surgery-related. While under general anesthesia.       Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function)    I had surgery to remove teeth from the roof of my mouth.

    I do not believe this was the first  time I died.   I believe the first time was when I was 3-1/2 years old.  

    Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes.  When I was being brought back, I became aware of the operating room and all who were there.    I clearly left my body and existed outside it    

    How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   More is probably incorrect because you move to a state of pure energy.

    At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         in the light    

    Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast    

    Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning    there was no time    

    Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid    

    Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       We are the thoughts. We have different senses. There is no sound or sight, but there is  so much more than everything we experience    on earth

    Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      Hearing was not a thing.    It was replaced by knowing    

    Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No    

    Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain     I was in an arced light. It may have been a tunnel, although I felt that there was nothing boundaried in this place.    

    Did you see any beings in your experience?         No    

    Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No         

    Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin    

    Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   brighter than anything, yet soft    

    Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     I was energy, the world  was energy    

    What emotions did you feel during the experience?         peace, better than peace, amazing, calm, joy, and everything good all at once. We do not have a word good enough or great enough for this.    

    Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness    

    Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy    

    Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world    

    Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe     we were one    

    Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No         

    Did scenes from the future come to you?         No         

    Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No       

    God, Spiritual and Religion:         

    What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Catholic   I had been brought up a Catholic and was attendant at Catholic school but had no real affinity with the teaching    

    Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         They changed but I am not sure if that is linked to the experience or natural progression     No    

    What is your religion now?         Other or several faiths   Pagan - energy focused    

    Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     Before, there was a before and after; a heaven and hell, and an 'us and them.' This life was real rather than a phase.    

    Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I was less fearful    

    Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No       

    Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No    

    Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No       

    During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     it is. We are all energy    

    During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     we are all energy    

    During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No         

    Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:         

    During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   we are. It is all connected and energy.    

    During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No         

    During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.     Time is elastic and not real.  There is no before or after. These  concepts are only from this manifestation of us    

    Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No         

    During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No         

    During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No         

    What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Unknown. Color is important and beauty and feelings are all so much more important.    

    Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Uncertain     

    After the NDE:         

    Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   there are no words    you are energy. It is better than anything you can imagine    

    How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I do not remember most of my life this stands out as a resounding memory or knowing that never leaves    

    Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain.     I feel things    when family die I know    I think I always did but then I think I had a NDE at 3-1/2, so maybe not before that.    I think I will have a third before I truly die and it will clarify my path for me    

    Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          what is to come is so much better than this    

    Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    immediately and I was told I was wrong    recently and people are now interested    

    Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No       

    What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     Once you have had it you know it to be true and I had physical proof    

    What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     

    Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         No    

    Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I was 16. Everyone's relationships change at that age.
