so by 1994 and it was later confirmed us
later in 94 95
then when Rockefeller hosted the
Clintons and there&#39;s that famous picture
of Hillary Clinton holding the book
about extraterrestrial intelligence at
the Rockefeller ranch when they were
visiting out there you know yeah okay
she actually is one who stood up and
stopped the briefing and said it&#39;s too
dangerous
we don&#39;t want it we&#39;re not going to
pursue this and ultimately politicians
are going to put their finger in the air
and they&#39;re gonna see which way the
winds are blowing and see what they can
benefit from they saw this as a
lose-lose situation in other words it
was a situation where if they were to
push on this they would be stepping on
some very big toes a very very big toes
how big several hundred trillion dollars
of world economic activity now let me
let me back this up now
so the how is hard for some people to
wrap their mind around when it comes to
this kind of secrecy but the why Israel
is the P as the resistance because if
you look at what these projects that are
unacknowledged special access projects
are doing what they really have been
doing has been trying to acquire as this
top-secret canadian document the Warburg
Smith document in 1951 states the modus
operandi the mechanism of action of
these extraterrestrial vehicles meaning
the technology the science and
technology because if your interstellar
you&#39;re not using Exxon jet a fuel you&#39;re
not using a rocket like SpaceX and
Virgin Galactic is using you&#39;re not
using something like the Space Shuttle
you&#39;re using some technologies that are
the transdimensional end of physics very
high energy electromagnetic field
propulsion systems that allow you to
drop out of 3d space and appear at
another point in space by going through
other dimensions okay
now you can do that without be going
transdimensional by just creating energy
from the so called zero-point field and
creating an anti-gravity effects you
have lifters so that you can go a
hundred thousand miles per hour make a
right-hand turn with no deceleration
effect because you&#39;ve created a bubble
in space-time that corrects for one
gravity that&#39;s what a lot of the quote
UFOs are that people see being test
flown out near Nellis and the Dugway
proving grounds in Utah and etc and so
on we mastered gravity control October
1954 I was not a twinkle in my father&#39;s
eye most of you weren&#39;t born at that
point I wasn&#39;t and that is when we
mastered gravity control how do I know
this the third highest ranking official
at the naval research labs the largest
defense lab for the Department of
Defense here in Washington is been a
friend for years and he was in the vault
and saw the documentation for this
unredacted because it&#39;s all the original
documents and that was the date so we
have not needed
jet engines rockets oil gas public
utilities surface roads think about this
steamships internal combustion engines
of any sort for at least 60 years and if
you really go back to the earlier
earlier part of the century we&#39;re just
plain free energy from Tesla type things
a hundred years but you&#39;re stepping on a
stock pile of money and commodities and
mineral wealth
being traded oil coal other uranium
that&#39;s worth in the aggregate several
hundred trillion dollars the US federal
budget is three or four trillion if you
take out entitlements and things that
are mandatory it&#39;s it&#39;s a fraction of
that so you&#39;re you know it&#39;s the tail is
wagging the dog here so the financial
interest the petrodollar interest the
big commodity trading firms like Goldman
Sachs and the big money folks that&#39;s
where the action is and those are the
Masters not the president not the
Congress not the UN Secretary General
certainly not the Prime Minister of
England etc so let&#39;s just like pull the
mask off and just admit that we&#39;re
living in a period of petrol oligarchs
kleptocrats klepto meaning theft like a
kleptomaniac kleptocrats and that this
sort of myth of free markets in a free
society and an open and free democracy
is just a myth because our democracy was
hijacked decades ago now on trivial
issues like the marginal tax rate or
whether you&#39;re gonna raise or lower
payments for Social Security the
President and Congress can fight about
that and it&#39;s sort of this this show
going on a whirling dervish show of
nonsense that goes on these issues they
don&#39;t want those clowns is how they view
it dealing with it so this permanent
unacknowledged covert program has put a
lead ceiling in and only rarely does
anything bubble up from there or down I
should say to the body politic
throughout of these unacknowledged
special access projects so it became my
task to find out how to do that and live
to see the next day all right
because they didn&#39;t do me good if I&#39;m do
it recklessly and I&#39;m dead you can&#39;t do
anything if you did
well you can&#39;t but it&#39;s you know
different so you&#39;re doing other things
so this McCain McCain the really the
central issue and Laurance Rockefeller I
suggested look we need then if the
president will not do this we need to
get together a group of people put
together this best available evidence
and also assemble top secret folks who
will have the courage to provide
credible documentation testimony about
what they&#39;ve known so I suggested and
organized a meeting at Asilomar facility
in near Monterey California in the June
of 1995 edgar mitchell was there with me
marina Popovich who is a very renowned
cosmonaut in the Soviet Union some KGB
officers were there and some of the
early disclosure project witnesses were
there now this is 95 this is 20 years
ago and Lawrence paid for it and and and
Laurance Rockefeller said look you know
I will totally support doing this and
when I was with him at the ranch I said
well why don&#39;t you take a lead a public
leadership in this your and I was
talking to him out on his his deck at
the with the beautiful Remington Native
American sculpture let&#39;s you know with
the the Native American on horseback and
is a very famous of course they have the
original of everything and I said I
really I need your help he says oh no
it&#39;s too dangerous for me he says there
are members of my family already jumping
up and down on my feet that I&#39;m doing
this much and I knew he was talking
about who&#39;s that he was talking about
the money people in his family he was
the philanthropy philanthropic guy who
just want to give away his wealth before
he died that was his whole purpose
really sweet man and so I said well ok
you know I told him you&#39;re old you&#39;re
rich and you&#39;re a Rockefeller I&#39;m noble
I&#39;m a nobody
I&#39;m a nor
Carolina doctor who&#39;s trying to do this
with no resources he says just I&#39;ll be
behind the scenes and he took his old
hands and did this and he said it&#39;s like
a flock of geese you know we&#39;re all
flying together I&#39;ll be back here and
you need to be here I said well yeah but
that head goose gets all the head they
take turns he says no no you should be
up here
it was very comical I said oh boy hey
this is like I said okay that&#39;s what
we&#39;ll do then and he wanted to stay
behind the scenes but he was to provide
that support hosted the Clintons so we
had something called project starlight
that formed before the briefing of the
CIA director that was the codename for
what became the disclosure project that
all of you know about and project
starlight if you were the AP The
Associated Press sued the Clinton
librarian got those documents those
documents are in my first book and at a
sillim are we had all these dignitaries
including Kevin Foley and astronauta
Carmel and Marine PO phobic and all
these folks sign a letter to the
President of the United States
recommending ending the secrecy it&#39;s in
my first book buy it get it see it read
it and that however was the The
Associated Press a couple years ago sued
the Clinton Library and got those
documents and they put them out on the
Internet
now at this point we knew by 95 the
president with all the cajoling we could
do with all the work Lawrence was doing
behind the scene hosting Bill and
Hillary at the j.y ranch for their
vacations a very good friend of the
presidents I don&#39;t want to name her but
used to live at the White House and very
good friends with with Hillary you know
said that Hillary did not want to deal
with this at all but Bill was so
interested in that you know he would he
would pull out the best available
evidence briefing packet that we put
together and we&#39;d be sitting in the
private quarters of the White House
going through it and she was Jesus
hilarious woman who
did a perfect imitation of Bill Clinton
and he said one time they put it out on
the floor and she was sitting there with
him and he was going through it going
well I know all this is true but they
won&#39;t tell me a thing not a goddamn
thing just like that about all these
secret programs so when she told me that
I said it sounds like mr. Clinton so
vote it from 95 until 98 I proceeded
then to approach various members of
Congress and we had already started that
process thinking well okay if the
president won&#39;t do an executive action
and force this way to control these
unacknowledged special access projects
maybe a member of Congress will have the
courage to hold a hearing and since we
now have identified first it was about a
dozen and then it became several dozen
top secret guys that could be subpoenaed
and swear under oath with penalties of
perjury federal penalties of perjury
you&#39;re testifying before Congress and go
ask some folks who are in prison for
lying to Congress about what they knew
and so I started assembling these folks
the first meeting of which was in June
of 1995 I had met with a number of them
one on one
but there&#39;s strength in numbers so I
realized that if we came together as a
group and they got to know each other
and they felt that it was they felt
safer they felt protected if they were
all doing it together you see what I
mean okay so that was what I did this
pull people together because these men
and some of the women involved were
terrified about speaking about this on
their own as lone wolves but I said
let&#39;s get a mass of us together and do
it so that first gathering was very
historic because it was it was sort of
precised
what we did in 2001 now at that point
you know I decided look we are going to
be very careful with this so I wanted to
be sure that
not only did the president have no
access which is in itself proof of the
illegalities of these unacknowledged
special access projects but that the
appropriate oversight Committees of the
Congress of the United States didn&#39;t as
well as key people in the Pentagon so I
proceeded then to do a series of
briefings and in 1997 here in Georgetown
at the Westin Hotel we gathered together
I think about 20-25 of these top-secret
guys and a closed meeting not open to
the public to invite members of Congress
members of the administration and people
from the Pentagon to hear their what
they knew and it was a very
well-organized private event no media
was there and the public didn&#39;t know
about it if there&#39;s a very limited way
and the idea was that we wanted to get a
member of Congress and like congressman
Dan Burton who was chairman of the house
Government Oversight Committee Reform
and oversight committee that issued a
thousand subpoenas to impeach Clinton
about the stain on the blue dress was
there and he was interested because one
of his closest friends who kept his
appointment scheduled had had a UFO come
outside her window in Indiana some years
ago and told him about it so he knew the
UFOs were real and he turned us and he
says I want everything you have
everything you have and then someone got
to him and he didn&#39;t hold the hearings
but there were many members of Congress
and other people who were people from
the vice president and Al Gore&#39;s office
there there were people from the White
House there were people from the
Pentagon the day after that event I went
straight to the Pentagon and did a
briefing what&#39;s called a stand-up
briefing for Jay to the head of
intelligence for Joint Chiefs a
different one from the one who forced
the meeting at wright-patterson Air
Force Base and
this Admiral Tom Wilson hosted us at the
Pentagon in the evening you know where
all the Admirals and generals are the
outer ring because they get the views
said the inner ring can&#39;t see anything
and I went there with astronaut Edgar
Mitchell myself a couple of the
disclosure project witnesses and my
assistant
Shari adamak and what was fascinating is
that before I went I had my military
adviser send to the Admiral a document I
had received and it&#39;s the first
top-secret document in the briefing for
the president that I did for Obama which
we&#39;ll get to in a little bit and in this
is dated from the 90s and it&#39;s from
Nellis Air Force Base what people call
mistakenly area 51 it&#39;s not the proper
name and this document actually was a
security alert because there were some
UFO spotters who had penetrated the
perimeter of Nellis and they were going
to have to shut down operations with
their EMGs their electromagnetic wave
etic anti-gravity test flights in that
range that they have built and it lists
the list is fascinating for the names of
the compartments and I just want to
share a few of them just because and
this is a dated 28 July 1991 Oh 900
hours and it&#39;s from the National
Reconnaissance Office NRO which is the
super-secret spy satellite operations
part of the Air Force originally so it
went to commanders net royal ops cosmic
ops that is a clearance these are all
compartmented operations Maj Maj ops
Magi ops comment COMSEC Ile int human
human intelligence ops AF OSI Nellis Air
Force Office of Special Investigations
and then a whole bunch of different
numbered compartments red flag dark east
dark south the pop Mesa military
operating center Sally Carter t1 groom
lake MOC dreamland MOC blackjack team
blackjack control is that Edwards by the
way the control is it Edwards but there
was a team at at Nellis Aquatech
seaspray
etc so one of these compartments was
known by Admiral Tom Wilson I don&#39;t know
which one but it was being operated
through a contractor and all the
important stuff is done by corporate by
the way if its key its corporate
Lockheed Martin EG&amp;G East Systems
Raytheon Northrop Grumman Booz Allen
Hamilton on and on Edward Snowden by the
way worked for Booz Allen Hamilton who
contracts for the National Security
Agency so the corporate world is
actually where most of the use apps gets
entered and then they interface with
these use apps within military and
intelligence like this and if you
approach it from the government they say
well it&#39;s you know it doesn&#39;t exist and
you approach it from a corporate it&#39;s
privatized it&#39;s a corporate secret like
Microsoft&#39;s code got it it&#39;s
hermetically sealed away from everyone
between those two techniques very clever
very illegal very clever but the Mafia
is always very clever and this is the
biggest mafia in the world so when Tom
Wilson that when Admiral Wilson
recognized when these compartments he
contacted them now this is prior to me
and Edgar Mitchell know the people
arriving at the Pentagon in the spring
of 1997 and he picked up the phone and
he said this is Admiral Wilson I&#39;m a
head of intelligence joint staff j2 I&#39;d
like to be read into which means briefed
I want to be read into this project blah
and they say yes sir we know who you are
but you don&#39;t have a need to know
and he said goddamn it I&#39;m the head of
intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of
Staff how can I not have a need-to-know
and they said sir we cannot discuss this
with you and we will not click hung up
on him block this line would not receive
any further calls from this is an
admiral in charge of intelligence
assessments and putting intelligence
together for the Joint Chiefs of Staff
of the Pentagon of the United States now
this I know for a personal fact so so
now you have a coup d&#39;etat the extends
to the even the highest levels of the
Pentagon so by time I walk through the
door to do what was supposed to be a
45-minute stand-up briefing for the
Admiral and his staff he was so scared
and so mad he was scared and the meeting
went for two hours and if Edgar Mitchell
hadn&#39;t had the lead to go to an
interview in New York City on some TV
show it would have gone on for three or
four hours he kept cancelling his other
appointments at the end of that briefing
I said we really need your help and he
said well what can I do they&#39;re not
going to tell me anything the best thing
I have in my arsenal is the b-2 stealth
bomber that I know about and you&#39;re
telling me that there are unacknowledged
projects that have things that can go
transdimensional Lightspeed and beyond
that can do circles around my b-2
stealth he says it&#39;s point set match I
said well you still need to help us get
control he says how can I do that
without having the Secretary of Defense
or the president ordered me to without
myself doing something rogue see see
here&#39;s the good guys are trapped by
being good I said the only thing here&#39;s
the thing the only thing bad about nice
people is that they&#39;re nice and the
people who are rapacious criminals are
not nice and they don&#39;t give a damn
about the law or people&#39;s lives and they
don&#39;t mind killing you so he said I
can&#39;t do this and then he said well who
have you met with I said well the CIA
director and the heist her name you know
all these people&#39;s look he says well you
know if those folks are being a
can&#39;t pushed aside what am I supposed to
do so he basically threw up his hands he
says I don&#39;t see that I can do anything
