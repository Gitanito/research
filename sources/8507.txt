Abstract

&nbsp;

  My   wife's NDE and other paranormal events in her life set the stage for my   conversion to Spiritism. Her NDE caused her to foretell events that had a   profound effect on my previous belief that we had complete free will and control   of our lives. This is the story of how I thought I lived a life of freewill and   discovered I was deposited on earth with plan to navigate.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Introduction

&nbsp;

I was not a spiritual person. I had a vague   notion of a higher power, but one that really didn't care about us individually.   After all, how could any power keep track of each and every one of us and   determine what we had done in our lives. I had hopes of a life after death in   heaven, but in reality, I expected that when we die, that is it. To me, the   Bible was rather boring and ill written. I read and emulated the ancient Greeks   and Romans more than our Western Civilization Christian traditions. From reading   Plato, Livy, Cicero, and other ancient philosophers and writers, I believed that   one should be honorable and truthful, even though I frequently failed at being   so.

&nbsp;

My Wife's NDE

&nbsp;

When my wife was seventeen years old, she   had a bad accident, which caused her to lose a great deal of blood.&nbsp;   She was taken to a hospital in Rio de Janeiro. She was delivered straight   to the Emergency room, the doctor saw her and said, 'Quickly we have to   operate.'

The nurse said, 'But doctor, we don't have   any anesthesia today.'

The doctor replied, 'Then we have to do   without.'

Ana said to herself, 'God, I am ready to be   taken.'

Next, Ana noticed a lady, maybe a nurse,   she was all in white, but the white seemed to radiate, who held her hand and   told her that everything would be alright.

Ana's recollection was that surgery took   just a moment, she heard the doctor say she would be discharged the next day.   Ana did not feel any pain. She didn't see the lady who held her hand. The next   day, her sisters told her the doctor thought she was on drugs, he was amazed she   didn't cry out in pain.

When Ana arrived in her room, she saw   another lady sitting down in the corner of the room, watching her, then the   hospital room wall became transparent and she saw her life going by, like a   movie. Ana didn't know at this time she had fallen into a coma.

As the movie played on, the lady in the   corner communicated with her by speaking directly to Ana's mind. Eventually, Ana   figured out that the movie was a movie of her life. Not only from the past, but   it extended to her entire future, until her death. She saw her future marriage,   building her house, scenes from a different hospital room in the future, the   success of her children, everything. At the end the lady told her, 'Bye, I am   going back to my home.' Ana asked, 'Can't I go with you?' She replied, 'Not   now.'

Overtime, the full memories of her trauma   receded, but certain events would trigger flashbacks and bring to life   particular scenes from her life's movie.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

My Spiritual Upbringing

&nbsp;

Let me be clear upfront, my mother tried   her best. My mother took me, my sister, and my father to church every Sunday. Of   course, my sister seemed to like to dress up and wear her white gloves to   church. My father went, mainly because he liked playing on the Church's baseball   team. Although, he would complain that our Reverend didn't have the commitment   to win, since he always tried to find playing time for everyone, not just the   best, of whom was my dad.

After the service, the young ones were   taken to a Bible nursery school. I remember a group of us, this is when I was   around five or six years old, we sat in a semi-circle, with the teacher and   several of the mothers in front. Mine included. We read from a book, which had   pictures of animals and a transparent picture of Jesus transposed over the   illustrated bodies. The point of each page was to reinforce the idea that Jesus   was inside all of us. At the end of each page, we would all say, 'This is Jesus   inside of the animal'. Which was quite simple for me to do, since they had a   picture of Jesus right over and partially inside each animal. Then, we got to   the last page, on the page was one of those cheap mirrors that badly reflected   our image. As I was the last person in the semi-circle, I had plenty of time to   figure this one out.

Suddenly, the first child yelled out, 'This   is Jesus inside of me!' All of the mothers looked pleased at the successful   teaching of this principle. One after another, the children would say the same   thing, each time re-enforcing the correctness of thought and the spirituality   that existed in each of the little darlings. By this time, I was thoroughly   confused. What the heck were they seeing? Evidently, my book was special. The   mirror did not lie.

When it came my turn, I yelled out, 'It's   me!' Was this the mark of a special destiny for me? That when others saw Jesus,   I saw myself. I looked up and saw my mother put her hands on her face and bow   her head down in shame, while the other mothers looked on with pity. My euphoria   evaporated when I saw that all of the other books also had a mirror. My next   thought was how could they have all been so wrong?

As I got older, my performance at church   did not improve. I was a typical (well maybe atypical) active boy and if I got   bored during the sermons, I would crawl under the pews. For some reason this did   not go down well. But, the good news is that I really liked our Reverend. He was   the nicest man in the world. Our two families would go to vacations at the beach   together. Everyone at the church knew our families were friends.

When I was about ten or eleven, I was   sitting in the pew with my mother waiting for our Reverend to walk down the   aisle to start the service, I told my mom, 'Look mom, God is coming!' Everyone   laughed. I didn't know why, after all, he was a great guy and a wonderful   person, wasn't he God? For reasons I have still not figured out, my mother gave   up and let me stay home, with my dad, on Sundays. I will always cherish those   wonderful Sundays, playing for hours with my army men.

As one can detect, my spiritual IQ was low   to non-existent. I believed in facts and in what I could see. As I progressed in   life, I did not change my outlook. I considered people who believed in spirits   and ghosts to be mistaken and those who were very religious, to be people who   needed a crutch to survive daily life.

&nbsp;

My Wife's Earlier   Experience

&nbsp;

Before my wife had her Near Death   Experience, she had had a different type of revelation. When she was a young   girl of 14, she went to her godmother's house to bring her some food, as she did   on many occasions. This day was different, she told Ana to come close to her.   Ana's godmother held her hands and began to tell of certain events that will   happen in the future. She told her that she would marry a foreigner, meaning in   this case a man who was not a Brazilian. After hearing about so many wondrous   things that would happen to her, my future wife was very excited. After all, to   a 14-year-old girl everything must happen rather quickly.

All through her twenties my wife waited for   these foretold events to occur. She had worked for other people, even while she   finished high school. She led a modest life in her small apartment. Gradually,   the rhythm of daily life and the numerous encounters that gave rise to great   hopes, which always led to failed expectations, allowed her to forget, or at   least to suppress her memories of her godmother's talk and her time in a coma.

I met Ana in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, when   she was 31. I had already been married once and had no wish to marry again.   Little did I know that I was not in control of events, somehow, after meeting,   we were married within eight months.

&nbsp;

Remembrances of the   Future Foretold

&nbsp;

When we got married, Ana spoke to me about   her past experiences with her godmother and in the hospital. When I heard that   Ana was told that she was destined to marry a foreigner, I just smiled and said   to myself, 'yes, right.' I was condescending, I didn't believe a word, thinking   these were just the product of superstition and wishful thinking.

But then, little hints would occur that   there was more to this than pure fantasy. We went looking for a house, trudging   through home after home as if trying to walk in a swamp. I was getting very   bored with all of this, when we came to one house.

My wife said, 'This is it!' I answered,   'This is what?'

She told me this is the house where we were   going to live. We called the real estate agent and made an offer, we were told   that there were two offers on the table.&nbsp;   I explained to my wife that we had a small to zero chance of getting that   house.

'But', she said, 'That house had three   trees in the front! Just like my godmother told me.'

'Ah', I replied very smugly, 'The house   actually has four trees in front.'

'Nevertheless, we are going to buy that   house.' She retorted, with an air of superiority.

Somehow, the other two offers fell through   and we purchased the house. As we moved in, I again pointed out the four trees   in front. She merely looked at me, with that loving but slightly exasperated   expression.

A month later, a wind storm blew through   and knocked over one of the trees. I thought about it for a minute, but put it   down to coincidence.

Other events would occur and afterward she   would say, 'Now I remember, my godmother told me that would happen.' Again, I   would always smile and say, 'Of course, dear.'

&nbsp;

The Improbable

&nbsp;

Years past, and life went on. I was working   for a bank, when the great recession started to form in 2006. The stock price of   the bank started to drop. But I knew, the bank was financially healthy, after   all, the entire senior management told us so. I had a conversation with Ana   about the sub-prime business and how if many people couldn't pay their   mortgages, other banks could be in trouble, but that we would be ok.

'Oh, now I remember,' she said, 'my   godmother said you were going to work for a bank that would go bankrupt, but   don't worry because you will still work for that bank, it will just change   names.'

What the heck was that! Impossible I said   to myself. I dismissed what she said completely.

A month later, a well-connected firm took a   part ownership in our financial institution. I thought that if they invested in   us, with their association with the power brokers in DC and in Wall Street, we   must be in a good position. I was so smart, I invested in more stock, hoping to   make a large profit when we pulled through these troubles.

Four months later, the FDIC closed us, and   I had lost everything. Or so I thought.

I came home and explained to my wife what   happened. She said, 'Don't worry, they will hire you back.'

But, they didn't. I was given some months   extra work to help transfer knowledge. At the end of that period I would be   looking for a job in the worst financial crisis to hit the United States since   the Great Depression.

At the end of my extension, I stated to   look for a job. Again, my wife said, 'Don't waste time looking for other jobs,   they will hire you back.'

What did she know? She didn't realize the   extent of the catastrophe, I and millions others were all looking for those few   positions.

I feverishly sought out work, after   numerous fruitless interviews, in the end, after only being out of work for four   months, I was hired back by the same bank, but with a different name.

&nbsp;

Quest for an Answer

&nbsp;

I, who had always believed in free will,   that I was a person who made my own destiny via my hard work, good choices and   bad choices. For whatever happened to me, was caused by my actions or   coincidence. Coincidence being the random events that may affect your life,   while your life intersects with other people's lives. Plus, the randomness of   natural occurrences, which may shape your life at times.

The improbably of an old women, who lived   in practically a hut, with a thatched roof and earthen floors with chicks   running around the floor inside the house (for I visited her once, when I first   married Ana), could tell my wife thirty years ago, that the bank I worked for   would go broke, change its' name and rehire me, was for all accounts an   impossibility.

All I was left with, was the facts. If   someone could perfectly forecast the future, then the future must be known by   some power. My well-packaged belief system had been utterly destroyed. Stepped   on by events.

I searched 'destiny', 'pre-destination',   'fate', and everything related on the internet. I read many theories. One, which   was interesting, is that all events our foretold, the Universe is like a grand   DVD, in that you are able to select any moment and replay the scenes. This may   be true, but the theory couldn't explain why or who caused this. From there, I   researched the idea of the Universe being a giant hologram. Again, yes, it could   be true, but why?

Then one day, I was watching the Brazilian   channel Globo on cable TV, there was a program called 'Fantastico', similar to   our '60 Minutes'. It was about Chico Xavier and his aptitude to communicate with   the spirits. His ability to write down what the spirits told him, the smallest   details of deceased people's lives, all for the benefit of surviving family   members. The facts he wrote down were investigated and found to be completely   accurate. This was startling. I decided to read about him.

At an early age he communicated with his   departed mother. In later life, a spirit, Emmanuel, told him that he would be   used by the Spirit world to communicate with humanity. Chico was told to use the   doctrine of Allan Kardec as his guide, and never stray off that path. Many   people had tried to expose Chico as a fraud, but he said, 'I will never fall   down, because I never stood up.', meaning that of all the people he helped, plus   the over 400 books he psychographed (written with his hand, but the spirits   dictating), he gave all to charity, and he lived a very simple life.[1]

I decided to read about Spiritism and Allan   Kardec. I found out that Spiritism was presented to us by the Spirit world so we   here on earth may perfect ourselves and prepare the earth to reach a higher   plane of existence.&nbsp;  Using Spiritism,   we are expected to improve our collective behavior. Spiritism was brought to us   via the work of Allan Kardec.

In 1857, in response to the growing   interest in spirits and mediums, Allan Kardec (pen name   of the French teacher and educator   Hippolyte L'on Denizard Rivail  ) organized a series of questions   designed to discern the exact nature and wishes of the spirits. He did not   accept information from just one medium, but verified the response to a question   from multiple mediums throughout Europe.[2]      Allan Kardec wrote a total of five books documenting the answers to his   questions. The basic tenants of Spiritism are:

&nbsp;

    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Love God.

    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Do unto others as you would have others do unto   you.

    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Practice justice.

    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Forgive all who offend you.

    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Make amends for our own wrong doing.

&nbsp;

The spirits revealed to us the basic facts of our   existence:

&nbsp;

    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Your soul is immortal.

    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     You travel through multiple lives as a process to   learn to love, be fraternal, and be selfless.

    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     The goal of God is for every spirit to one day be   pure.

    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     There is no eternal hell, it is a station for   souls who are materialistic and have an excessive love of self. Eventually, each   spirit will learn selflessness and ascend.

    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     There are many levels of heaven. Heaven is not a   place where we have eternal leisure, but one of on-going work to help others.

    6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Life on earth is like a school. You are assigned   events in your life and how you react and behave will determine your spiritual   progress.

&nbsp;

The last point struck me like a lightning   bolt. The series of trials in our lives are proscribed, we must march on through   our assigned tribulations. In that our life is pre-destined, but we do have free   will in the choices and our attitudes during those trials. Oh, I wish I had   learned these truths earlier, I wouldn't have been so full of self-pity. I   wished I could have met my adversities like a true gentleman, but of course I   failed.

While many other precepts of Spiritism   coincide with other religions, the principle of karma and multiple lives, but   nothing else explained the entire process of the injustice and seemingly   incomprehensible tragedies that befall innocent people. The maimed, those born   with disabilities, gentle and wonderful lives cut short, all apparently without   true cause. But, there is a true cause, and in many cases the people so   afflicted asked for their right to pay their redemption, seeking a path to learn   to be better spirits.

&nbsp;

My Life as a Spiritist

&nbsp;

I am reading and re-reading Allan Kardec's   books and I am slowly absorbing the books that have been translated into   English, which were psychographed by Chico Xavier. The novels dictated to Chico   by the Spirit Emmanuel are full of fresh insights into our behavior and the   subtle manipulations on our lives by the Spirit world. While the books inspired   by Andre Luiz directly open a portal into the process and the amount of   assistance given to us by the Spirit world.

I wish I could say my life now is one full   of bliss and understanding. It is not, but I am learning, slowly to control my   temper and my baser instincts. I am still trying to not judge people at a   glance, not to dismiss those I deem unimportant. I desire to see all of humanity   as my fraternity, I am trying, and alas the old habits are hard to break. I   shall not give up. I shall continue to pray for guidance and the power to   correct myself.
