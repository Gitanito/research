Fred Threlfall I was in the Royal
Canadian Air Force back in the early 50s
I was a communications instructor on
through communication schools while in
Toronto stationed as at an Air Station
and as an instructor
I just finished an experiment and I was
on my way back to my classroom and there
are other engineers and what have you at
the Institute that I&#39;ve known of because
a frequent visitor there and it was just
one experiment that was going on and it
was approximately a four by four
enclosed glass enclosure inside this
room and on a on a cabinet there was a
large glass ashtray and I said well
what&#39;s what&#39;s going on and so we&#39;ve got
an experiment underway we&#39;ve got the
similar in the other room with no last
ring that&#39;s what I forgot to mention so
they&#39;re talking away and one of the
scientists said go ahead and next thing
that ashtray wasn&#39;t sitting there
everyone went into the next room an
excited as can be because the ashtray
was sitting there so it D materialized
and materialized and which was quite the
thing and I have to see an ad then and
with my knowledge through electronics in
those days which is still a lot
primitive compared to what it is today
it was quite exciting and I could
visualize that these things could happen
and my joy this is this is back in 1990
or 1953 on a transpired
it was so station Toronto which was he
old hunt club and she the RCAF station
Toronto and when the when the scientists
said okay
did someone flip the switch or do
something to make sure there will be
I didn&#39;t see who it was there was a
panel of instruments and everything off
on the side and who was there I had to
throw a switch when they had they had to
energize whatever equipment that they
had in order for to take place it just
disappeared completely it was there one
minute and boom or one second and it was
gone
and as we went into the other room it
was sitting there it was the identical
thing of it exactly the same object went
through everyone rushed through to the
other side to see if anything happened
and it did it&#39;s there and the excitement
and I saw it there and well and I was
asked I said what are you doing here and
I said well I just finished an
experiment sir and his on the way back
and I was just talking to a couple of
our friends here well you&#39;re not
supposed to see this
I say yes sir and I went back to my
classroom so you&#39;re specifically told
that you were not that I wasn&#39;t supposed
to see that because I wasn&#39;t part of the
investigation team or the scientists but
with having being an electronic
instructor I had taught parents to be in
facilities for the experiments some of
the experiments that that we would
volunteer for would would take a period
of time sometimes be two or three days
and with the clearance that I had I was
able to draw out a projector and also
films from the library on the base and
they used to get the films that were
taken from the cameras that were mounted
on Spitfires and hurricanes Mustangs
whatever during World War two and
you see the plane flying along there and
they&#39;re going after the German aircraft
and you see the tracer bullets going
over and the craft going down in flames
and that and up in the corner one of the
corners up down or down below there&#39;d be
a strange little object sitting there
which to my attention and I&#39;d seen it on
many films different shapes different
positions and this piqued my curiosity
with regards to UFOs I had heard of the
crash down in Mexico New Mexico I have
seen the maneuvers in the sky at
complete right angles and rapid speed in
many cases in many cases I have seen it
from different films
drawn from the library so they&#39;re not
just one there are several times I saw
the objects that I believed were UFOs
and I could see definitely and they
there are different shapes
some of them around some of them are
oblong but they were at different
distances as well so there&#39;s the odd one
you&#39;d be able to see a little more
detail than the other well the the
detail it&#39;s not a real close-up shot
shot but it would look like there how I
explained it like markings but not like
markings we&#39;d put on an aircraft you
know it it could be a series of windows
or lights or whatever it could be it you
just see a note line
no doubt that these were structured
objects and not that&#39;s correct yes 20 30
films over a period of time yes I&#39;d see
UFOs in them whereby it was something
there that was watching what was going
on
my first exposure to the discovery that
this anti-gravity research was quite a
big area not talked about very much but
was a major endeavor by major aerospace
corporations this came from this report
electrolytic systems which I found very
revealing this is a photocopy
