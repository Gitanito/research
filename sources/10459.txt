I was standing on the step on the right side of the train, holding on to the bar attached to the side of the train.  My right arm was extended out as I enjoyed the rush of air and I traveled along so fast.  In the distance, I could see on the right: surrounded by a beautiful forest, a shining white building, with a gleaming white dome.  I thought, 'If I want to visit that building, all I have to do is let go.'  But then, I woke up as the doctor was telling me, 'We are just going to draw some blood gases, Nona.'
