I was at peace and so calm and perfect. It was so clear and it was very bright. I was looking down. I knew all my friends and family were there that day, but I couldn't see them, they were there in spirit. I will never forget this experience for the rest of my life and I really believe that I walked through the valley of the shadow of death and it was the most peaceful and perfect moment of my life. I don't think of this everyday but  it is always with me, it was so amazing, My mum and dad got a phone call from the neurologist and were told we have did all we can and don't know if your son will live or die. It was a miracle for me to recover as well!
