we are here in scottsdale arizona with a
wonderful group of supporters
and i would like to thank all of you who
came and who have been part of this
and uh have supported it because we
couldn&#39;t have done this without your
donations and financial support
and
we&#39;re hearing the speaker by the way
we&#39;ve got an echo here
um
so
one of one of the things that
has struck me in the last few years
doing this project is that every time we
move forward
classified projects try to get ahead
uh this happened after unacknowledged
came out
and 650 million people around the world
saw that
they then formed an organization called
ttsa which was a cut out for the
intelligence community
with luis elizondo and chris mellon and
help it off and others who have been
involved in these classified operations
for years
that began to have a controlled leak
of information
on the subject that went through the
mainstream media and the media covered
it because it was authorized by the
intelligence community to do so
they do not cover this story unless
authorized by the intelligence community
in the mainstream media in this country
and most others
the result has been that the war
narrative the alien threat narrative got
embedded in every single story
in a very subtle and nuanced way
and this is of course uh
why we&#39;re here we&#39;re here because we
knew this was coming
harold rosin was told this was coming in
1974
i was read into these plans in the early
90s
that they would at some point pivot
towards
a
wild card
uh situation
of a threat from outer space to try to
unite the world
around a very militaristic level of
unity or rather than an enlightened
level of unity and we&#39;re at that point
we&#39;re at the inflection point
and and this is why this is such a very
critical time
the good news is that
where our plans here
are to create a documentary that will be
released
free to the world without a distributor
meaning that you don&#39;t have any
intellectual property hold back on it
and if people want to put it out for in
its entirety anywhere on any site in the
world they will do so be allowed to do
so
and that means every influencer
celebrity friends you have who are
influencers or celebrities yourself and
this is where we really need your help
we have crowdfunded
the project now we need to crowdfund or
crowdsource the disclosure
okay and that is that&#39;s really why i&#39;m
very grateful all of you here because
this isn&#39;t going to happen
without us we the people doing it and
this is what i learned the very hard way
and i just want to give people a little
bit of a a tour to force over the last
since 1992
or so
most people don&#39;t know the history of
disclosure
the history of the disclosure project
was
an accident or planned by some higher
forces perhaps
as a result of a close encounter of the
fifth kind ce5 contact
on the beach in florida in 1992.
so we had about 60 people there for a
weekend expedition i was just starting
to do this working as an emergency
doctor
as my normal life and in my spare time
leading an interplanetary contact
ambassador program and so we were down
there and there were a couple colonels
there and people were air force folks
who had come
and
first night were out
it was only a couple nights it was a
weekend
we had four
extraterrestrial vehicles just pop pop
pop materialize in the sky and you&#39;ve
all seen the funny video where the
southern dude goes holy damn hot
and it&#39;s attention calm down we got that
one
um but the photographs were taken and
ended up on the front page of pensacola
paper
so within 30 days i get some calls
from people in the intelligence
community
so
the general who&#39;s was head of army
intelligence albert general albert
stubblebine iii
contacts me he invites me to a meeting
in atlanta
a few days after this contact to meet
with him
allegedly for some conference which was
actually a dog and pony show
uh from some intelligence people
and they put me at the i got there i
thought i was in the back of the room
and they put me at the head table with
the general
and some cin national security agency
folks
and that night took me up in
to a room in this hotel and they
basically said well who the hell do you
think you are
and what do you think you&#39;re doing
making contact with these civilizations
without our permission
and i informed him i don&#39;t need your
permission
i&#39;m a free denizen of the earth and the
cosmos
um i&#39;ve had contact with these
civilizations i know who they are why
they&#39;re here and you can&#39;t deceive me
moreover i&#39;m not wealthy but as a
medical doctor i don&#39;t need your damn
money
and thirdly
when i was 17 i died
and i&#39;m not afraid of death therefore
you have no traction with me
and of course he was not happy hearing
this he goes like this we know exactly
who this son of a is i said yes
so what are you going to do about it
so that was my entree as a doctor who is
doing this as a civilian for universal
peace and enlightenment and contact
getting dragged into this
morass that we call the national
security state
so that little and it was apocryphal but
i just wanted to give you that sort of
setting so then within about a year then
i&#39;m sorry a month a month later
uh the co-founder of the peace corps
dr maury alberson
and
an apollo astronaut and some other folks
organized a conference
and before the conference was a week in
retreat and saint malos uh in near esses
park
and so some of these same people show up
at this and
of course they&#39;re trying to intercept
what we&#39;re doing
and at that meeting
again
the general the head of army
intelligence
general albert stubblebine iii
offers me 2 billion with a b u.s dollars
if i would stop what i was doing and
join their group and be on the sort of a
board operating board
it was a serious offer and i said no
thank you i cannot be bought he then
went behind my back to my wife big
mistake
um
and i said no we&#39;re not going to do this
uh and she thought oh he was so nice he
was flattering you and i said yeah
double speak with pork tongue
um
so
i&#39;m a court of cherokee so we kind of
like the native american view of all of
these sort of corrupt people
so
what i decided was
they&#39;re not going to stop but i&#39;m going
to just keep ignoring them
so then i get approached um shortly
thereafter
by some people who um
were committed tied into the clinton
administration
and of course he took office in january
of 1993
and
what they basically communicated to me
was that the president and the cia
director
as well as other members administration
had made inquiries since the subject and
had been denied access
which
did not altogether surprise me but i was
a little bit unsure that could be true i
think most americans or people around
the world would think
top of the pyramid would be the
president united states and certainly
his senior national security team
not true
so eventually
i was asked
to
brief
the director of the cia
and i just want to share a couple
sentences from
the letter
from myself this is one document i think
you have
um
and it&#39;s from the head of the arlington
institute who was friends with the
director of the cia r james woolsey
and he says
i talked to woolsey this morning and he
suggested
getting together over dinner and then he
wrote there is an active attempt being
made at lower levels of government to
sabotage project starlight which was the
code name for the disclosure project
before anyone knew about it
this group almost certainly has tapped
your phones
and is aware
of most of the details of your plans
they are feeding information gathered
from their collection
like the fact that you might be meeting
with woolsey
back in a negative way
and then he says
operation starlight will become a
serious underlying threat to the status
quo
and then he continues
you must understand
the great principalities
and powers will oppose your plans if
they know about them
and then later says remember the most
powerful people in the world
will have a deep compelling interest in
our activities and we&#39;ll use everything
in italics
at their disposal to affect
their objectives
so
with that i went okay i mean i&#39;m
an emergency doctor and sort of seen
everything i said all right we&#39;ll go now
at the time i really thought that this
was a ruse
but it wasn&#39;t and in fact the cia
director had been denied access as had
the president subsequently lawrence
rockefeller
with whom i had met hosted the president
and first lady
bill and hillary clinton at the ranch at
wyoming
where they were subsequently briefed
with materials we had assembled
but ultimately they signed off and
didn&#39;t want to proceed
these meetings continued so once i
realized that
the national security state was not
going to
allow the president
or the cia director
or a lot of his senior team
have
control over this
we ended up having a really serious
problem
with figuring out well then what are
they going to do so i started putting
together a team early on
of whistleblowers people in the
government who knew about this
and this continued you know for a number
of years behind the scenes
the public knew very little about it
because i was trying to keep it
confidential because otherwise they
wouldn&#39;t have taken a meeting
in 1997
most people don&#39;t realize that we
conducted a briefing for members of
congress where edgar mitchell the
astronaut
and about a dozen of the first top
secret military and intelligence cia
people were gathered
to do a private briefing
for
members of congress including chairman
of committees and what have you but it
was private it was not up on the hill in
a skiff a secure communication
intelligence facility it was at a
private setting in georgetown um so
when we did that event
uh there was a man
uh
and he had been on an interagency
committee in 1974 interesting year same
year that burner von braun shared with
carol rosin
and
he
said look i have been on this committee
and back at that time i remember this is
97
almost 25 years later we could push a
button
and an algorithm would kick in
where there would be a staged alien
attack
on the earth that we are doing and that
everyone from the president to the
national military command center
personnel and most of the joint staff
would not know
it&#39;s
not the alien they would think it&#39;s e.t
and it isn&#39;t
now i had heard similar stories from
people who had been in these operations
before
and that&#39;s when i realized that this was
actually the heart of what they were one
of the reasons for the secrecy the
technologies that they&#39;re hiding is one
reason because that&#39;s an eight or nine
hundred trillion dollar
issue with oil and gas and coal and
everything else is destroying the planet
but this was actually bigger because
this is how eventually they could unite
the world not in peace
but in war
and not in enlightenment but in
fear
and so this is when i realized we have a
very big problem i never knew that i
would step into this arena
ultimately then right after that i
briefed admiral tom wilson
and that&#39;s another i don&#39;t know if
you&#39;re keeping up the documents but i&#39;ve
been going through some of them and
admiral wilson
was the head of intelligence joint
chiefs of staff
he was somebody who
really did not know about this issue
he&#39;d asked about it we provided briefing
to him written before i met with him
i remember this is you know j2 head of
intelligence joint staff sort of second
in line after the the head of it
uh the director of the defense
intelligence agency who i later briefed
and he said no
in his inquiries on this
he was denied access completely and was
actually threatened with the motion
so that is a huge problem
and i said well you&#39;re not the only
person who&#39;s run into this
wall
he said who else i said well cia
director members of the senate
intelligence committee i&#39;ve met with the
secretary of defense
gordon cooper
who is an astronaut
whose team filmed an object landing out
on a dry lake bed back in the 50s was
asked by
secretary of defense cohen
for bill clinton to get him all that
information so he could get the original
footage
out of the vault or the classified
projects
gordon cooper did so because he and i
were given a talk to a organization in
washington
and he shared me this story and the
secretary of defense
was completely unable to extract
anything on this subject including
having all the actual intelligence on
that case from an astronaut whose team
filmed it
he could not get it and this is the
secretary of defense of the united
states
so by between 1992
and 1997 i knew we had a massive
unparalleled constitutional crisis
forget watergate
and little scandals like that
or the monica lewinsky scandal this is
the biggest one in the history of the
united states period
nothing comes remotely close
and so
it began
and at a certain point i realized
that
the politicians simply were not
going to do anything about it
and for that reason
we decided to do it ourselves
so in 1997 under the guidance of
discussions with constitutional attorney
who i wish to introduce for a moment
daniel
and my military advisors i did an unless
otherwise directed letter
what does this mean it means you this is
a military strategy where you can write
to your commander or to the head of an
agency and say this is my assessment of
this assist situation this is what we
are going to do about it unless
otherwise directed unod so we did that
went to the heads of the fbi nsa cia the
whole alphabet zoo
everyone return receipt requested i can
prove it happened
and i said you have until the end of
january
1998 to inform us that we are not
correct
and unless you do
we are going to
proceed as follows
the projects that are dealing with this
issue are unacknowledged special access
projects and are being run illegally and
unconstitutionally
therefore
we are going to authorize and
enlist the help of people who have top
secret clearances
to hand off to us documents information
schematics
testimony what have you and they cannot
be prosecuted under the national
security act
because
that would require that that project be
within the bounds of the law and we can
prove that they are not
we can prove in a court that key people
in the united states government who
should know and have a need to know
have been denied access
and
no one as of this day april 25th 2021
has ever contacted me
or anyone who&#39;s given me a classified
document that is not declassified that i
have published
or
any of our now 980
or so military and intelligence and
corporate witnesses
no one&#39;s been contacting said be quiet
or you&#39;re in trouble not one
and if they were to do so
daniel sheehan and myself and a couple
other constitutional attorneys would go
after them
seriously in a major
federal lawsuit in case to protect
whistleblowers which is what they are
because they are not exposing
like snowden did projects however
ill-founded
and ill-advised that were snooping on us
like prism but we&#39;re being overseen by
the president and the oversight
committees they&#39;re exposing projects
that we can prove have lied to
presidents
have been
uh completely done
off the books in black projects
unacknowledged
special access projects meaning those
who are in them don&#39;t tell anyone about
them
unless that person has been read into it
and agrees to keep it secret from even
their commanding officer
so that that is how that happened
then it took us from 1998 to about 2000
to assemble who we wanted to have and
then in 2001
had the national press conference
for the disclosure project which
launched the whole modern disclosure
movement
now that eventually was seen by 8 900
million
people but the day of the event for the
first hour
we had had my
security people watching that building
overnight
there were people in the building
putting devices so everything out of the
national press club building for the
first hour was jammed
by the national security agency that&#39;s a
true story
hopefully we&#39;re not being jammed is this
still working we&#39;re good
okay so
that is that is just a quick overview of
this
and i think that
the reason this cosmic hoax documentary
is so important
is that it&#39;s a singular focus on this
very important
warning
that many many many people in the
intelligence
services in pentagon have told me about
this plan to stage a threat
and now you and i all of us are living
through an era where that is literally
happening before our very eyes
it&#39;s literally happening if you look at
the spin
of the stories coming out of the
mainstream media
first of all
there are two massive lies in every
single story
in the mainstream media number one
that these objects are a threat to the
national security they are not
everybody knows it even the people who
are saying it like louise elizondo has
admitted they know that
number two
that we don&#39;t know how they operate
that we have no idea
how these could be going faster than the
speed of sound and not making a sonic
boom never mind i have met with multiple
aerospace engineers at various aerospace
companies and also who&#39;ve worked for the
intelligence services who helped design
and have
worked on these systems
since the 50s 60s 80s
so
you have that&#39;s not only alive but a
damn lie now i&#39;m i&#39;m not saying that
senator marco rubio or former trump
national security and director of
national intelligence
head
radcliff are are knowingly lying but
they&#39;re reading from a script
okay i i don&#39;t know what they know and
don&#39;t know i do know that what they&#39;re
saying to you the american people in the
world
is false it&#39;s completely and provably
false and that&#39;s what we shall prove
today and in the course of this
documentary and over the next two months
because the public needs to know the
reason for the hold back
on acknowledging
that we would have anything that could
behave the way the tic tac
that video you know that was all in the
news
a couple years ago and the new ones that
are coming out from the naval destroyers
which are these
triangular objects over over our navy
the pentagon week or two ago so yeah
those are real
they didn&#39;t say those are ours
those are made by our aerospace and
clandestine operations and and
engineering operations
so they want people to think that our
navy destroyers are being harassed
by these things no it&#39;s because the
captain of that navy ship and the and
the pilots who were chasing
uh these tic tacs and other craft off
the coast of california they weren&#39;t
read into the existence
of these technologies that are in
unacknowledged special access projects
that&#39;s how secret it is
the captain of a naval destroyer would
not have clearance for that certainly if
the ci director was not read into it why
would a captain on a navy ship
so this is where secrecy
is dangerous because in the darkness of
that secrecy
these people can unroll
a program that would trick everyone a
false flag
and it&#39;s happened before we&#39;ll get into
that later but i just want to give you
this big picture before we welcome
our
first guest from russia
oh and we&#39;re not
okay well we seem to have a technical
problem we have a cosmonaut who is
supposed to be
there but we will then
uh proceed
with with
another part of the program
i think we can have
is carol rossen ready
when you guys get timothy carol
can you um start now because she&#39;s next
on i&#39;ll introduce her we have an ask a
cosmonaut who is supposed to click in it
115 to 120 and i&#39;ve been waiting for the
signal but apparently he&#39;s not online
uh hopefully we&#39;ll get him online
soon
but first then i would like to introduce
a dear friend
beautiful soul
oh carol i see you left
oh she&#39;s trying to get him
let me just give you a little background
come carol a neighbor of hours
had
told me about pearl rosin
and she knew of her because she had read
an article about her in a magazine
and said you really need to talk to
cheryl rozza so who&#39;s that
and so we reached out
and she of course had been
the spokeswoman for vernavon brown who
invented the rocket for the germans in
world war ii um the father of rocketry
later was
foundational in our aerospace programs
here in the united states
uh and
he told her
well he was very sick last years of his
life or so
in 1974 and onward
about
what would happen
and that it was
carol rosin&#39;s sacred task
to prevent
and keep weapons from space
because space
we must share with our cosmic cultures
and neighbors
and this was his heartfelt request and
his dying request to carol and she&#39;s
been faithful to that
for now what 47 years so i&#39;d like to
introduce kell ross my dear friend
this is
possibly the last presentation i&#39;m ever
going to give
because i think there&#39;s nothing more
that needs to be said after this event
in terms of pivoting the course of
history
there are so many issues of concern that
we all have
for me as an educator i was concerned
about the orphans on the planet at that
time i heard there were thirty thousand
i have no problem we&#39;ll get them homes
now i hear there are four hundred
million
orphans
and i hear one to two hundred species a
day are disappearing and you know all
the problems of the earth changes and
the climate and the disease
and the issues that all of us have
personally as we&#39;re trying to survive
and enjoy our lives it&#39;s pretty hard
my husband john cypher i proposed to
three days after i met him because i was
looking for an actor to give my speeches
for me
now he&#39;s written a book called if you&#39;re
not depressed you ought to be in therapy
so it&#39;s a kind of a comedy because it&#39;s
99 limericks
but it&#39;s prose
and it addresses all of these issues
and
that&#39;s where my heart is
in the issues but i came here today
after quitting about five years ago
because of stephen greer
i think he is a world champion
what he has put together over the years
gets to this point where we have a
choice that can be made
is astonishing
he&#39;s courageous he&#39;s discredited he&#39;s
challenged
he&#39;s got all kinds of things that go
against what he&#39;s doing
um including i hope we get our link to
the russian connection
um they were shut down from youtube
just a few days ago and they got back up
we&#39;ve all had our challenges to get this
issue out
so i really honor the people who are
listening today
and who are potent really paying
attention to what stephen greer has put
together because this is going to be a
fact-based presentation
not only today but in the film that he&#39;s
producing
in the
courses that he&#39;s getting ready to teach
in the writings that all of us are going
to be doing as we&#39;re all aging and this
travel thing has been very difficult
during covet and all the excuses that we
have to be
playing in the masquerade
we have a chance now to remove that mask
that&#39;s what the lies are
when i met werner von braun
in 1974
this is who&#39;s known as the father of
rocketry in this country
he escaped from germany germany from
pinnamunda he was also discredited he
worked with prisoners never worked with
prisoners
there are all kinds of things that
happened to the german scientists who
really were good people they were rocket
scientists
space cadets they just wanted to go into
space
and in germany they could only work with
technical people but it was all being
geared to the war machine so they get
out of germany some go to russia some
come here
i was very lucky
i didn&#39;t know it
i was teaching sixth grade
i thought i was going on a planning a
field trip for my students
when i met von braun
and a few hours later
after he explained to me that he was
dying of cancer
and that he thought it would be funny if
a woman in a miniskirt would come in and
start talking about space-based weapons
and why they shouldn&#39;t happen and why we
needed to put a lid on the war machine
before it escalated into space because
if it does
we can&#39;t pick it we can&#39;t protest
this would be a disaster
imagine
as president putin says having nukes
hanging over your head and weapons of
all kinds
of course we&#39;re not supposed to know
that we&#39;re we could be friends with
russia
and von braun said
you need to go to russia you need to go
to china i did
because we need to be friends
we can&#39;t keep identifying one enemy
after another that leapfrog game that we
do
they may have weapons so we have to have
weapons well ours have to be better but
they&#39;re going to have to think that ours
are better so we better be better than
the ones they think we have
this goes on and on
this is ridiculous
it&#39;s a child&#39;s game
and all of our lives are at stake
from any one of a number of what dr guy
mcpherson a space i mean abrupt climate
scientist expert who has 61 feedback
loops guy mcpherson
that he says could wipe us out in a
minute in an instant
61.
i had a little radio show until i quit
five years ago
from american freedom radio donated to
me and i interviewed him once and then
again and then again
oh my god
this is for real
these are he said to me just two nights
ago
tell everybody look at the methane map
on the planet
when&#39;s the last time you heard people
talking about methane we see it from
space we need these satellites
but guess what they&#39;re putting thousands
and thousands of satellites up and are
they doing it with consciousness
maybe for the pr campaigns
no
i called elon musk&#39;s
office
i talked to the president of the company
that i talked to his lawyer he was a lot
of fun he actually had a great sense of
humor
and he said oh he&#39;s not going to talk
about peace and space peaceful uses of
space technology no no no
he has
confused children to deal with and
divorce and now he&#39;s going to have
companies many companies and where his
contract&#39;s going to come from
so a lot of people who are good people
but they count on the contracts
and werner von braun taught me all of
this
and he was dying of cancer
and he said if you don&#39;t get a ban on
space-based weapons
the pivot can&#39;t take place to peace you
cannot have peace on the planet if you
have weapons hanging over your heads
aiming down at us and up
what are they going to aim it up for are
they really going to shut off our
communication
that i know some of the people listening
today you have had experiences perhaps
with real contact they call it with et&#39;s
coming in and having a conversation with
you
i&#39;ve never gone public with this before
especially in an audience like this
other than a little handful of people
maybe that i have been
in contact i have had extraterrestrial
beings walk through my wall
and as my husband the actor retired says
make sure they know it&#39;s not spielberg
so
it&#39;s real
now are we taken seriously when we say
that
no
and because i work from the
military-industrial complex view
that&#39;s what i came out of so i became a
corporate manager thanks to von braun
of an aerospace defense company
when he died
four years later three and a half years
later
i became a consultant a military
consultant excuse me i&#39;m allergic to the
planet
and i think
right now
i have to get a grip on the fact that
when i came out of the aerospace defense
industry
i realized that there&#39;s an accelerated
movement going on to weaponize space
space is already militarized
so if you&#39;re talking about stopping the
militarization space it&#39;s too late guess
what
but in space the military is different
so we have a way to communicate with the
military
and i know it works if you say we&#39;re
opposed to the weaponization
because most of the people i&#39;ve met in
the military are two most there&#39;s always
the handful as my husband says that
likes blood and guts they watch those
movies
but no
we don&#39;t want to protest the military
because it&#39;s not going to work they&#39;re
well funded they&#39;re huge they&#39;re really
really nice i&#39;ve gone to some military
balls i like those people i love a lot
of the military friends of mine i&#39;m an
honorary marine
from commandant al gray
for work i did with general joe
who took schwarzkopf&#39;s place
i was a consultant and got to go into a
meeting where i was the civilian who
said
how many of you have been to the
countries that you&#39;re studying 500
people three people raise their hands
where do you learn about the country
that you&#39;re going to be in as military
reps
books movies lectures oh that&#39;s nice
so i want to encourage people listening
to go to the countries go
i&#39;ve been to russia over 35 times
china i&#39;ve traveled you meet people from
all over the world in these meetings
they&#39;re not the enemy
at all
i&#39;d like to also encourage you to go to
website peaceinspace.com
peaceinspace.com
on it you will see a lot of russians you
know the enemy
well
they&#39;re not
and so i&#39;ve gotten to go to very high
levels
in russia
i&#39;m very close friends now with vladimir
mekov you&#39;ll see him on the website he&#39;s
the head of disarmament and arms control
you&#39;re going to see a little video clip
this is an amazing clip that you&#39;re
going to see today
from general leonard i&#39;ve ibishov
general ivashoff sits down in a chair
you&#39;re going to see him not in uniform
retired
saying
there are extraterrestrial beings here
and there is no threat
is this not our major
issue here
so dr greer is bringing out the threat
that doesn&#39;t exist
he&#39;s bringing out the treaty that i&#39;m
going to tell you a little bit about
the treaty to prevent the placement of
weapons in outer space and guess who
initiated it the russians and chinese
yeah
the enemy so we&#39;re not supposed to know
about the goodness over there you&#39;re
going to see a whole lot of
these just scan the news section and
there are a lot of pictures
with people from russia high level
saying the same thing we&#39;ve got to get a
binding world treaty it&#39;s verifiable
because we&#39;re only cooperating in space
right now
it&#39;s enforceable based on the
cooperation
get the treaty support it do what you
can
educate people about this treaty it&#39;s
posted on that peaceandspace.com website
and let&#39;s get that treaty signed but i
mean fast because the accelerated
process
is not just a basing weapons in space
it&#39;s the extinction process
and i know a lot of people want to deny
or not know about the extinction process
and the 61 feedback loops but guess what
it&#39;s serious
and i followed guy mcpherson for 30 some
years
this research is mind-boggling
and i don&#39;t want to put come from fear
on it what i want to come from is
solutions
because imagine
when we do this breakthrough that
stephen greer is talking about so he&#39;s
talking about the threat that doesn&#39;t
exist the treaty that can be signed
right now it&#39;s written it there&#39;s no
compromise on it it&#39;s been approved we
have over a hundred countries close to
125 countries who have agreed to not be
the first to place weapons in space on
celestial bodies or crafts this is very
important because you&#39;re going to hear
oh they&#39;re already weapons in space and
yeah right
yeah electronics you can use beams you
can use a grain of sand anything could
be a weapon
but we can
bet we can actually outlaw ban space
based weapons
on celestial bodies and crafts and when
you read the treaty you must read the
treaty
some of its legalese you&#39;ll hear it but
the story is there and guess what it&#39;s
the first document that acknowledges
indigenous cultures and cosmos cultures
i mean wow
you&#39;ll see now they can&#39;t obviously sign
a treaty indigenous cultures and cosmos
cultures but they&#39;re acknowledged in
this
and this has been approved by
international experts this treaty
so it doesn&#39;t need to be compromised or
rewritten we don&#39;t have time for it
because the other part of the
acceleration
is not just about this process to put
weapons in space but the extinction
process
now i don&#39;t think anybody listening to
this or listening to the film that&#39;s
going to be coming out or watching it is
going to be uneducated about the
problems on the planet
but we need to reach the people who
don&#39;t know
and if you can&#39;t get to them move on and
find the ones who can
so you don&#39;t have to write your book on
why it&#39;s um you have to be in therapy if
you uh to be if you&#39;re not depressed
the fact of the matter is you have a
chance right now to educate people so
what i did was encourage by von braun i
went to russia
during the time event drop-off president
and drop-off in the 83s
and drop-off gave me a statement first
of all i got off the plane
and i
in tourists stopped me because women
alone from america had never gotten off
a plane in russia what are you doing
here i said well i came to meet with
president on drop-off and i have this
list that i got of a newspaper of names
of russians
and they said well that&#39;s not possible
but they took me to a hotel
i got in the taxi cabs which were just
the people driving them at that time
this is a time when you still have brown
water in the hotels i mean they&#39;re still
getting out of all the horrible war
machines that they had gone through
so i got someone brought me a statement
by and drop off by the time i finished
talking with people like
road sig dave came to see me because i
sound like i&#39;m interested in outer space
and he was the head of the space
research institute imani velikov came he
was the head of the nuclear program
i met with teams of experts
and i said why do you want to be a
communist then i found out only one
percent of russians were communists so i
was completely wrong with my education
about russia completely wrong so many
ways
and they took me out to eat and i said
is this organic because there&#39;s no gmos
and they said we have no gmos in russia
we&#39;re not supposed to know that
well do you want world peace do you want
no weapons in space
now you&#39;re going to look at the peace
and space.com website and you&#39;re going
to see many people but that&#39;s only a
tiny portion
because after i started coming back and
commuting back and forth to figure out
what to do
how can we now educate people about
russia china the same thing
and i addressed a lot of audiences
and i never had anybody say to me we
want weapons in space they did say but
america does
and the allies who need to communicate
and stay friends because they want
extended business and trade as seen in
nato financial assistance or technology
transfer
so they have to be allies they can&#39;t be
friends around the world
with that viewpoint or they have a
belief system or perspective or
interpretation of what they&#39;re hearing
and so they think that america is a big
enemy
well
i live here i&#39;m a flag waving american
i&#39;m an honorary marine i&#39;m the head of
now the president of the peace and
emergency action coalition for earth
who was just given to me to be president
of by commander retired scott jones who
used to work for senator pell who was
the one who invited me to testify before
the senate armed services committee
a woman at that time and also
um i&#39;m also the founder of the institute
for security and cooperation and outer
space i had a three-story building in
washington i was testifying before the
house and senate and the president&#39;s
commission on space
on this issue
but i didn&#39;t communicate with the ufo
community at that time basically because
i thought most of them were whacked out
of their skulls i mean the stories that
were coming out and i couldn&#39;t present
those stories to the congress
or to my corporate friends
or as a military strategist that i
became i was the first woman this woman
that got me into a lot of doors actually
to address the space command when they
were forming the army
army navy air force and marines were
coming together to form the space
command and there i was in cheyenne
mountain going into the tunnels
whoa
and there&#39;s a war room i mean it&#39;s like
in the movies
but they were really cool i took my
husband the actor because i knew he
could get into more places than i could
and for a visit we have a picture when
john
my i thought was very sophisticated
husband
got on his knees in the middle of this
room and said so tell me are there
weapons are there et&#39;s in space
and they took a picture of them i have
that picture
in the space command
as we&#39;re going on the tour of cheyenne
mountain colorado springs there&#39;s my
husband on his knee oh my god well
anyway
this is a chance now we have
to use our dramatic forces our
communication skills
use the satellites use television use
the media
and get what you&#39;re going to learn from
this event here
out to the world with the emphasis that
dr greer is bringing to us
that there is a treaty
that can ban all space-based weapons
and i say all because if you start
talking about the different weapons that
we all know about that we want to ban it
gets confusing and they won&#39;t it&#39;s
distraction we want something simple to
get done
now
that&#39;s what this treaty that you&#39;re
going to read
will tell you about
and we still we know a lot of
alternative technologies steven&#39;s a
master of this alternative energy how
does this come out of this program of
reverse engineered you&#39;ll hear about
that today too
these are technologies they&#39;re available
you&#39;re going to see drawings of it
you&#39;re going to hear different
perspectives of it but this perspectives
that are going out right now
are perspectives interpretations
systems they&#39;re biblical
i mean
do i need to go into that one for you
i hope not because
we have to create our own narrative now
we have a narrative that&#39;s going to come
out of these this event
and what you&#39;re going to hear from dr
greer in the future
and his witnesses
we have a story to tell it&#39;s a new story
we need a new story a new narrative but
that&#39;s based on facts
as steven said to me we want facts we
don&#39;t want fiction we don&#39;t read
rhetoric anymore we all know
i&#39;m giving you a lot of rhetoric too but
it&#39;s an introduction to this issue from
my experience it&#39;s direct i don&#39;t know
anyone the russians were saying to me
before i came here but you&#39;re the only
one that ever mentions the treaty
i don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen
here
i hope not i hope you all go back with
that one thing we can get done
get that treaty signed read it
read just the headlines by the way you
don&#39;t want to go through all the
articles that are on that website there
aren&#39;t that many but i wrote the
headlines so that they used as talking
points and you know what that did
just this
we got over a hundred countries
committed
to not being the first to place weapons
in space this is huge i mean i&#39;m a sixth
grade school teacher
you know get over it if you think you
can&#39;t do something you can
so
find out what that is follow your
guidance get into what greer teaches you
about meditations about reaching into a
higher consciousness
i&#39;m meeting hundreds of people in russia
one of the people you&#39;re going to see on
a little video clip is professor
alexander siemenov i love this guy
he has had two meetings a year
for 50 years in russia where he brings
in hundreds of experts from every field
and i met so many of them
and they all have this space bent
so you&#39;re going to see another lady
valentina on this little video
and she is
a lady that&#39;s a
she&#39;s also the head of the direct she&#39;s
the director of the transformation
consciousness center
really before we go to this could you
just hear two couple things oh please
what did bernard brown
tell you where von braun tell
and what did you see when you went to
russia to see and drop off in the
underground
and what did you see in the defense
long-term strategy
stay right here so you can guide me
because i have all these stories okay so
those are three key things i&#39;d like you
to share before we break to the videos
okay first stay here verna von braun
told me that there was going to be a
faked alien invasion that this is really
so important this is why we&#39;re here and
he knew he was in on the meetings there
was no question about it and that was my
first assignment would let people know
that there will be a faked alien
invasion and it&#39;s going to be huge the
technology exists to produce it it&#39;s
going to be even more now that was back
in 74 to 77
now we can actually see it
oh i wanted to tell you this about on
drop off too because he then sent me to
russia president andropov in his time
had a whole slew of
videos
videos and i was taken
downstairs into a building i called it
the dungeon because it was so dark and
into a little theater
where i saw so many videos i mean over
an hour&#39;s worth of videos of ufo craft
and i was so young and naive at that
time that i didn&#39;t know what to do with
that information when i got back to the
states and tried to tell them in the
states i went to the new york times
office in new york and i said could you
go to russia they would love to get
media over here to see all this stuff
and nobody would go to russia
so it didn&#39;t get out and what was the
third thing
well i think it&#39;s really important to
share what you saw um while you were a
corporate consultant on this plan that
this is a part about
four-star general yes wesley clark
general wesley clark i thank you i saw
on tv he was on democracy now where i
saw him
general wesley clark
was talking about something that he saw
when he went into a defense office
that were seven countries
seven countries against whom we were
gonna have a war
seven now you know them we&#39;ve already
had them iraq iran
libya lebanon
um syria sudan
there were seven of them but
i called him from moscow the last time i
was there which was in 2019
i had his phone number one of his
friends had given me his home phone
number and wesley clark answered the
phone
and i said i&#39;m carol rosen and i&#39;m very
verna von braun&#39;s former spokesperson
and now i&#39;m here in russia giving
speeches at the
association ecology of the unknown which
is alex simenov founded that and also
working with general ivashoff who
founded the academy of geopolitical
problems
and he said oh what do you want and i
said well i want to comment from you i
want to have a conversation because
you presented this list of seven
countries but i have a whole long list
that made me quit my job at fairchild
industries because they were on the wall
of the countries against whom we&#39;re
going to build space-based weapons
a whole list of them longer twice as
long as his
one of the countries was yemen
if you&#39;re looking at yemen right now and
the starving suffering sick children
how long has that been going on
well that was on the list that&#39;s the one
that made me quit my cushy corporate job
and give up my thunderbird car
and all the things that go in the perks
of an aerospace defense job
i quit in that very room
and i stood up in the room and said
what is this list and they said well
this we&#39;re preparing and this is the
theme
the theme of the defense industry we
have to prepare for war prepare to fight
and win
if you haven&#39;t seen the vision 2020 i
have it on my website it&#39;s been taken
down but it&#39;s from years ago
it&#39;s the air force viewpoint for lay
people and every almost every page says
domination control
the united states has to dominate
control we have access to space we have
we give permission if you want to go
into space one of the reasons the allies
need to be in cahoots here
well now
we have this list that has
actually occurred if you go back and
i&#39;ve had many people say oh carol rosin
she was right well i don&#39;t want to be
right
what i want is for somebody to wake up
and i one last thing about this to say
after
that list
that i realize now has all happened all
these words have happened
now we know what&#39;s going to happen in
space with the fake alien invasion we
know that we have technologies that can
solve enormous problems which stephen
and the speakers know about that they&#39;ll
tell you
but are we just going to know it i think
back to a show that john did on broadway
my husband in 1776
where he played thomas jefferson and i
remember one of the themes of it was
does anybody care does anybody see what
i see does anybody hear does anybody see
does anybody care
does anybody see what i see
that&#39;s why you&#39;re here
that&#39;s why you&#39;re listening
you&#39;ve got to pay attention to this
you&#39;ve got to look at that website on
the introduction
one more thing about that the
introduction of that website if you read
it down to the bottom
there&#39;s a link to the organization
association ecology of the unknown which
i&#39;m honored to be representing here from
moscow imagine me on a board in moscow
this organization
has this website up that has launched
700 videos that&#39;s why youtube shut them
down recently but they got back on
not all ufo et there are a lot of
speakers like us
speakers from the ziegler&#39;s readings
that dr
professor alexander siemenov puts
together
and some of the video clips that we&#39;ve
collected here we won&#39;t have time to
show them all the ones we can&#39;t show i
will post on peace and space but they&#39;re
also on the website link that&#39;s at the
bottom of the introduction of that
website
um
a
is
foreign
yes
the reason this is so significant
is that
to have a man of that stature to go on
the record this is very recent that he&#39;s
he came out and sent me this statement
because he knows
that we&#39;re pivoting very quickly from
this unacknowledged special access group
that&#39;s a transnational clandestine
operation and organization to move us
into this
last card
