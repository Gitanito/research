  		              		Experience Description   

    For years, I had a memory of looking down on a little girl  sitting on a very high bed. It was covered by one of our  patch work quilt.  I could tell the little girl was me.  I thought that I had seen this in a dream and was just remembering a dream. But I kept have the same dream.  One day as a teenager, or young adult, I talked to my mom about my reoccurring dream. She affirmed that something like this had really happened when I was about 4 years old. 

  I have had life-long asthma. My mother said that one night when I was about 4, I had a particularly bad asthma attack. It was so bad that she wrapped me in that quilt and took me to a local Emergency room.   She told me the ‘high bed’ was a stretcher. And 'yes' I was sitting on that quilt.

  As an RN nurse, I believe the asthma attack was probably so bad that I was deprived of oxygen enough or stressed enough to have an Out of Body Experience.
