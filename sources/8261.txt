I could clearly feel/see that the wind still blew, the water still lapped around me, the sun continued to shine bright and strong. I could feel these elements but they did not affect the void time/space that was created around me.

Then I heard a voice directly in my mind. I clearly perceived that it came to me from above-left side. This being I did not perceive as being 'more' than myself. It was more like a 'similar' to myself. A telepathic dialogue took place in which certain questions were asked and I was compelled to answer truthfully. At the end, I made a decision and at that point, the 'void' stopped and, with difficulty, I made it back to the shore.
