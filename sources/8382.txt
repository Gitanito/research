  		              		Experience Description   

    The story is about my mother who had died some days ago.   

  My mother was at the beginning process of becoming a nun. At the time, she was embroidering and sewing. 

  One day she suffered an awful cut, and mother superior told her to take an antibiotic to get rid of any problem more rapidly. My mother was given an injection of penicillin. At that time, she didn't know she was fatally allergic to penicillin.  The reaction was immediate, she became dizzy, and fell to the floor. My mother  was floating abover her body when her companion screamed and told the others about what had happened. Mother was sad for the shock she had given the other girl. She was looking down from the top of the room like a bird, and could see everything. Then she was in a  tunnel, like clouds and a vortex, through which she travelled towards a light. According to her, she wasn't frightened. My mother said that she felt a peace that she had never felt before. Nevertheless, a powerful and serious voice said to her, 'Get up, it isn't your time!' 

 She wanted to stay there because  she was very happy. But something threw her back to her body where she woke up. Some days had passed, during which she had been in a coma.
