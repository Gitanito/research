  		              		Experience Description   

    January 5, 1985, is a date I will never forget.

  I was part of a motorcycle club called the 'Wheels of Man.' It was some of the best times in my life riding with that wild bunch but this is not a story about being a biker, it is a story about my wreck on a vintage 1965 Harley Davidson Pan head ex-police bike.

  I was at the club house about to leave when one of the brothers asked me if I would take his son home. Well, since I did not drink that day I told him, 'Sure, no problem.' I met Frank and we went out to the bike. I started the bike, he got on and we headed a few blocks away so he could get his bike and go back to the clubhouse because he did part time work there. I was only 1 block from his house when it happened.

  A drunk guy made an improper left turn in front of me while I was doing 45mph. He hit us with the front of the truck on the passenger side by the front bumper. When the bike went down, Frank was pulled under the truck and through the back passenger wheel breaking his back in about 15 places.

  When the motorcycle wreck happened I was knocked out of my body and that’s when the NDE happened, right away on impact.  I was outside my body watching everything happen in slow motion to me, the bike and Frank. All I could think was 'Poor Frank.' I saw the guy hop out of his truck and run over to me kneeling down over me when I saw myself grab his hair and start punching him in the face. I wasn’t even in my body and I was still kicking some ass! I remember seeing people and the ambulance pull up and a couple of paramedics running over to where my body laid in the road motionless. I was again back in my body in tremendous pain everywhere in my body. I remember seeing a paramedic over me flashing a light in my eyes, and then heard another siren (most likely a cop car or fire truck). I was in the ambulance now.

  I was going in and out of consciousness when I remember hearing one of the Medics say, 'We're losing him!' I actually heard the flat-line on the heart monitor they had placed on my chest. I went from horrific pain and suffering right to Bliss and Happiness, and that’s when the pain stopped. It was unlike anything I could actually explain. I felt it from the right side of my body first, kind of like each cell was going numb and at the same time my Spirit was being pulled from this mortal body from right to left. It was not painful just scary feeling. Then it happened, complete peace. I never floated above my body or saw a tunnel of light after I entered the ambulance.

  Everything started turning white, a brilliant white until there was no form, only bright light. At first I wanted to shut my eyes but I had none. Then the brilliant white light, that felt like I was being hugged, of love started fading out revealing the most beautiful scenery I have ever witnessed. I started seeing flowers, vibrant flowers. Some had colors I have never seen before, going off into the distance along the rolling hills. I was moving towards them, gliding along the ground. Then my vision started to clear more and I was by a river looking at a gazebo.

  The gazebo had 2 high back wicker chairs with a glass table between them. On the table was what looked like a full pitcher of lemonade. Two empty glasses sat there waiting to be filled. Soon after I started having a feeling, the overwhelming feeling that I am not supposed to be here right now, and later when I cross over again this is going to be my home. I started to look to my right and I saw the most beautiful cabin I have ever seen. I only got a glimpse of it when the brilliant white light started to fill my vision. I heard a whoosh! I was back, back in my body experiencing horrific pain. So after I came back I passed out. I woke up a few times before they induced a coma.

  I do remember awakening out of the coma and wondering how a spirit that was so infinite is now crammed back into this body of cells. Like 20 pounds of mud crammed into a 5 lb burlap bag. I was so amazed I could do things I started playing with the strings on my hospital gown, amazed that I could make the hands move, let alone play with the string.

  I still appreciate the little things in life. I feel that when you’re born into this world you cry because you have gone from a place that is complete bliss and Happiness, to a world of pain and suffering. Feelings, emotions and the pain of being born to this world is like a huge wave that you come out of. I would cry, too.

  That was the second time I died. As you can imagine I often reflect on that day back in 1985.

  Going through this really makes me appreciate life more, but there is something else. It makes me hate this place. Let me try and explain:

  When I had full awareness, I started seeing things differently, for instance I realized how rare and precious life is, and that we as a race (more like cultures) take almost everything for granted, when it is all a gift. The Gift of Experiences!

  This planet is so full of diversity and adventure, but yet most of us never get to understand the adventure without governments or religions getting in the way of living true life to its fullest. I think if we all started taking personal responsibility for everything we do and stop asking for forgiveness for everything we do we can start living life to the fullest, or with more appreciation.

  Life is full of ups and downs; these experiences make us who we are. Not how many people we can convert to our faith, or to get others to think and see things their way. That only makes the converter feel more comfortable and stronger in their faith. In the end, it does not serve anyone or anything.

  I could ramble on and on about the ethics of humanity but it was a personal experience and I have said enough for now. Peace to all who have and have not experienced life through the eyes of Death.
