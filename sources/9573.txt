  		              		Experience Description   

        My older sister decided she didn't want me in the tree house. She had one her friends slam a tree house trap door on my head as I topped the ladder. I fell off the ladder and onto the ground.  I didn't feel the impact. 

  Immediately, I was back at the top of the ladder. Somewhat bewildered, I looked down at my crumpled body on the ground below, wondering how could I be on both, the ladder and down there in a heap. It all felt completely different.  Nothing had the weight of physicality. Things and people were surrounded by a glow emanating several inches around them. Then, I watched the adults start to panic.  My father became  and my mother went into hysterics. The others there were frozen still.  I would now call them in shock at the unfolding event. All I heard was silence. I could see their mouths moving, but I didn't hear them. I watched from the ladder as they scooped up my body and carried it toward the house. They laid the body on my parents' bed. Then someone decided to feel along my spine and everythings went black. I awoke in a lot of  pain. 

I have had problems with my lower back and neck  ever since. 
  
  During the experience, I neither saw or communicated with higher beings. I didn't see  tunnels, light, or brilliant colors. I did see faint auras around everything and everyone. I have come to the conclusion that I must have been on the etheric plane, the one closest to the physical. Being only six years old, I had no fear and death was not a  concern for me. I was at peace, but puzzled by being in what appeared to be two places at once. I didn't understand why everyone was so upset. While obviously separate from my body, I felt perfectly fine. I was light as a feather and it was great.  

  Years later, in my early twenties, after studying some Theosophy and Occultism, I set out to try an astral projection via a seven day candle ritual. On the seventh day after the meditation, I lay down on my bed, and was out of my body. I was on the etheric plane again much as I experienced back in my childhood. The aura glow was around everything, but I didn't see any  wild colors and inhabitants I had read about that populating the astral planes. Complete peacefulness pervaded my being. I walked/floated as I felt weightless, toward the bedroom door and then stopped.  I thought that if I go out there like this, my friend in the next room might see me as a ghost and freak out. That could be bad for the both of us. Turning around, I saw my body prone on the bed. I felt yanked as I  slammed back into my body. Bodies kind of have a mind of their own, and mine was not happy at all about me stepping out. I awoke with a migraine.  Much to my frustration, I have not been able to replicate a projection ever since. 
  
  My experience launched me on a spiritualist path as I grew older. I am interested in Theosophy, a dash of Occultism, and a sprinkling of Buddhism. I lost my Episcopal Church upbringing once I was confirmed and witnessed a congregation of hypocrites after sitting in on the lesson phase of the service.  I do consider Jesus to be one of the truly great spiritual teachers to grace this little planet. I prefer to walk my own path, whether rocky or smooth. I suppose that makes me one of those New Age types. Though I'm far too materialistic to be a hippy, but am more like  Bohemian.
