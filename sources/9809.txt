  		              		Experience Description   

    It's in the fire-brigade truck  that I made this journey.

   It started with my passing through a tunnel. The colors were dark, like grays and browns. At the end of the tunnel  was something like the edge of a ravine.  I saw this white light that I can't explain because I  had never seen a  color like that before. I felt extraordinarily well. I remember that at a certain moment, I said, 'Good. It's okay, I will go.' Then a voice said, 'You have to return home. Your wife and your little dog are waiting for you.'  
  
   I knew a similar state while using LSD in 1968-1970 during  the hippie years. During one of those journeys, my spirit  had gotten a kind of absolute knowledge. Yet, when it was over, I was unable to understand what I had been understanding. Another time, I had an out of body experience in the 1980s while using hallucinogenic mushrooms. After passing a whole evening laughing, I went to my hut in Bali. I lay down on my bed. After a few minutes, I notice that I couldn't speak,  move, or hear anything. Then in a timeless state,  I saw myself. I was at about 80cm or 1m away from myself.  I didn't feel any emotion. I not only saw myself on the bed, but I also saw myself in the air. There might have been some astonishment, but I'm not sure? And I woke up on the next morning. 

  In 2013, I had surgery for hernia. During the operation, I heard everything that was said in the room. Especially vivid was when the surgeon was telling that a colleague and his wife died in an car accident. In that experience  I also didn't feel any emotion. I talked about this with this surgeon who was very astonished about this. 

Well, I think that I have been as precise as possible.

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?           What is difficult in my case, is the fact of being confronted with an unusual situation,  so I don't  having the matching vocabulary. In short, words are difficult to find.

But I experienced several events that surprised me a bit, but  I had not been paying attention to them. Now in retrospect, it's different. It would be too long to describe because  there are several of those experiences. But the last one and not the least was the following: A week after leaving the hospital, I felt that a disaster would occur. I shared it with my wife.  The following day, several cities had been flooded, including ours, due to the breaking of a dam. It's since this event that I really reconsidered my previous experiences.

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     I can't explain it, except thinking about Benjamin Libet and his 0,5 second (that you for sure know about).  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     I can't explain it, my scientific knowledge is very limited.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?            No

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I would like to have another one to go further.
