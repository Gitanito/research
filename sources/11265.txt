  		              		Experience Description   

    My life situation at the time of the event was that I had a strong uneasiness with studies, but the end of a relationship made me fall into a hole. I didn't see a future for me, as my  emotional pain was unbearable. 
  
  I got to the point where I got some drugs  to  numb the worries, find some sleep, and calm down. One evening, I was in the kitchen and took one pill. The effect started  surprisingly fast and within a few minutes, I felt like I was  enveloped in cotton wool and my mind was foggy. Then, I still can't explain why  I took the pills one by one. It was as if I was  under remote control, automatically taking the rest of the pills until the package was empty. My senses disappeared and I felt like I was  heavily drunk. Suddenly, my ex-girlfriend was standing in the kitchen next to me.  We were still living together and I had been thinking that she was still sleeping. She asked me what I was doing. I said something like 'nothing', and then  lost consciousness for the first time. Blackout.
  
  Then I was in an ambulance. I thought it strange that I saw the paramedics asking for my health insurance. Then my senses blacked out again.
  
  All at once, I found myself in a very dark, cosmic space. I was standing in an endless expanse in outer space. I was surrounded in  absolute darkness. I could look infinitely far into the darkness, yet, I can't described this in words. It wasn't cold or warm. I had no feelings of temperature. I was without a body and  wide awake. I had  an absolute awareness of myself, which has nothing in common with my earthly perception. I never had been so aware of my existence. Questions arose, of where I was, and how I happened to come here.  I understood  that I could answer all the questions in the world. I had a universal knowledge and awareness. My mind had never been as crystal clear. There are no words on earth to explain having this  absolute knowledge.
  
  I noticed that I was utterly alone in this endless dark expanse. I felt lonely, but it wasn't comparable with a feeling of loneliness on earth. It was a thousand times worse because it felt like total abandonment. Panic set in as I felt all  alone in the dark 'outer space', without  stars, and no presence of anyone or anything.  I also couldn't go anywhere. On one hand, I felt bound at this place. On the other hand, where in a space of nothingness could I go to? I felt truly alone and powerless.  I felt as if I been forced to remain even a minute longer, I would have gone mad.
  
  Then, I woke up in a hospital bed.  I had to get my bearings, but I was happy that I escaped the dark space.
  
  I couldn't bring anything along of the omniscience. In comparison to this lucidity of the mind, the earthly conscience comes like a comatose state. How long I was over there? My perceived time was five minutes, but I was actually sleeping for two days.

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No 

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   The words to describe the space adequately don't exist.  The absolute awareness and the knowledge  are indescribable.  
  
  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  An absolutely dramatic experience, that is unforgettable.

  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Uncertain   Had already been hearing about it sometimes before, but it  never really understood what it was. Even though as a child, I sometimes saw my deceased grand-mother at night.  
  
  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     A person who has experienced this knows that it was reality. Now I wonder the other way round: is everything on earth real?

  At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No     
  
  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?       How long did the NDE last for you? How do people react to the narrative? Some of them suddenly report their NDE themselves, often they don't dare to do it - do you know other people with NDE?
