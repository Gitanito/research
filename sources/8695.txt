  Vision Compared Between NDE and Earthly Everday Vision:    Narrative responses to the NDERF survey question above

      This page contains 825 narrative accounts from near-death experiencers (NDErs) responding to the NDERF survey question in the title above. This is from the most recent version of the NDERF survey of 834 NDEs. Near-death experiencers that did not give permission to post their near-death experiences on the NDERF website are excluded. NDErs that did not share a narrative response to this question are also excluded.

      Methodology: 

      Experiences were scored as near-death experiences (NDEs) if they met all of the following:

  1.  A lucid, organized experience occurring at the time of a life-threatening event so severe that there is unconsciousness or clinically apparent death with an absent heartbeat.

  2.  An NDE Scale score of 7 or higher.

  3.  Shared by the individual who personally had the NDE.

  4.  Shared in English via the completed survey form on nderf.org.

  These are NDEs from the most recent version of the NDERF survey (nderf.org). They are sequentially shared NDEs from November 11, 2011 to April 8, 2021. All accounts were scored as NDEs if they met the above criteria and regardless of experience content to avoid bias in studying the content of the NDEs.

  We strive to make a collection of NDEs describing vision during NDEs available to the world with as comprehensive a compilation of such NDEs as possible. We would be delighted to collaborate in this endeavor with anyone with other credible internet sources of NDEs that discuss vision during NDEs.

      This list is public domain and may be used by anyone.

  Substantial efforts are made to minimize the risk of posting fraudulent NDE accounts on nderf.org: See a more detailed explanation. 

  We recognize that some responses do not seem to address the NDERF survey question in the title above. Some NDEs do not have vision and are more sensory than visual. This is the original data as shared on the NDERF survey. Consequently, there are spelling and grammatical errors which have not been corrected in the quotes below. Spelling and grammatical errors may be corrected in the NDEs posted on NDERF.

    Even a cursory review of this page demonstrates the common supernormal vision in NDEs.       



        	Comparison of Vision During Near-Death Experiences with Everyday Vision	   	  	  			Registry Number  			Post Name  			URL  			Vision Compared Between NDE and Earthly Everday Vision  		   		  			6102  			John R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1john_r_nde_6102.html  			My experience was not visual...more like an embrace.  		  		  			6106  			DW NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1dw_nde.html  			You are seeing things unable to be seen here. I had 20/20 eyesight here. I had complete contact there. What I &quot;saw&quot;, I felt and heard as well...  		  		  			6110  			Lysa NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lysa_nde.html  			I was really calm and unafraid  		  		  			6113  			Stephen M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1stephen_m_nde.html  			Everything during my experience seemed really bright, white, and warm.  		  		  			6117  			Brent M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1brent_m_nde.html  			Being pass out drunk prior to the experience makes one's recall very sketchy.  		  		  			6118  			Ana R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ana_r_nde_6118.html  			I think I was living without consciousness of myself and the world around me. From the time of the experience, I seem to be extremely more sensitive to others' hurts...at times without them even expressing them verbally.  		  		  			6119  			Shannon T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1shannon_t_nde.html  			I'm not sure it's a vision - because you don't have eyes over there - but your soul sees and knows everything.  		  		  			6120  			Karen NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1karen_nde_6120.html  			Everything was clear, precise and effortless to see. I felt more like the images were part of me.  		  		  			6124  			Paige M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1paige_m_nde.html  			One thing that was interesting is that I wear contact lenses to see as I have horrible vision. After the accident I had lost a contact lens [probably with the visor] but when I was looking down on myself I could see perfectly where as afterwards my one eye made everything blurry and out of focus.  		  		  			6125  			Sandy D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sandy_d_nde.html  			I could see every single hair on the deer and the color of each as it changed from root to tip.  		  		  			6126  			Lieselotte S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lieselotte_s_nde.html  			no difference  		  		  			6130  			Ellie P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ellie_p_nde.html  			everything appeared to be in sharper focus &amp; colours were brighter  		  		  			6131  			Kaleen NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kaleen_nde.html  			Everything was very crisp and clear  		  		  			6136  			Camryn L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1camryn_l_nde.html  			Everything was sharper, brighter and surreal in that I saw many things very much like we do in time lapse photography. The clouds, the sun, the landscape - all changed color continously depending on the cloud formation and the light. It was extraordinarly vivd and bright.  		  		  			6137  			Paul S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1paul_s_nde_6137.html  			As mentioned in question 4 above, it seemed like I had 360 degree vision.  		  		  			6138  			Rhonda C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1rhonda_c_nde.html  			not really a vision other than the tunnel and soft light.  		  		  			6139  			Kirat A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kirat_a_nde.html  			Vision was absolutely normal.  		  		  			6140  			Michael P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1michael_p_nde.html  			20/20  		  		  			6141  			Harold R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1harold_r_nde.html  			My vision seemed more hazy than in real life. I couldn't make out any details.  		  		  			6144  			Glenn F NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1glenn_f_nde.html  			actually i'm far sighted. everything in this experience was pristine clear.  		  		  			6147  			Kelly L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kelly_l_nde.html  			If you mean ability to see, I would say about the same.  		  		  			6148  			Bella K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1bella_k_nde.html  			vision was fine, other than communicating without words and looking into his eyes and finding answers,it was almost like watching a movie.  		  		  			6149  			Debbie B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1debbie_b_nde_6149.html  			I seemed to see more clearly during the experience  		  		  			6150  			Karen J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1karen_j_nde.html  			Before the incident my vision was normal, I still have 20/20 vision. I vaguely remember seeing the rapids, and my brother sticking his leg over the side to straddle the boat (which is what I tried to copy until I lost my footing). These visuals are as clear as everyday visuals that have faded by almost 20 years.  		  		  			  			  			  			  		  		  			  			  			  			Being pulled under the water I don't know if my eyes were open or not. But I saw nothing. Not blackness or whiteness, just a lack of anything.  		  		  			6151  			Jill D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jill_d_nde.html  			Same  		  		  			6155  			Erinn H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1erinn_h_nde.html  			My vision was blurry when i looked down at my body  		  		  			6158  			Marilyn R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1marilyn_r_nde.html  			It was like it was real and that an actual man was indeed carrying me up the stairs.  		  		  			6159  			Sue C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sue_c_nde.html  			Multi-dimensional  		  		  			6160  			Tony D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1tony_d_nde_6160.html  			None.  		  		  			6166  			Jean R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jean_r_nde_6166.html  			It was more a sense of complete security and safety...and difficult to describe visually. The buildings in the city looked like milkglass to some degree with veins of gold going through it. But there seemed to be a great deal of flexibility to its construction as well. Seats seemed to be able to mold to your shape.  		  		  			6167  			Michael L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1michael_l_nde.html  			THERE WAS NO FEAR, I FELT COMFORTED.  		  		  			6168  			Jack M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jack_m_nde_6168.html  			Very similar as far as thought process and field of view.  		  		  			6171  			Jeanette F NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jeanette_f_nde.html  			I am short sighted and whore thick lensed glasses. My vision with glasses prior to the experience was fine, as long as I have glasses on, very short sighted without. During the experience I could see perfectly well. I am still very myopic.  		  		  			6176  			Carmen J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1carmen_j_nde.html  			there was no technicolor..just sepia tones of oranges browns and reds and dark browns.  		  		  			6178  			Ellen K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ellen_k_nde.html  			no vision  		  		  			6179  			Ronald A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ronald_a_nde.html  			everything was so much brighter and vivid  		  		  			6181  			Steve N NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1steve_n_nde.html  			Well, it was different! You don't ordinarily see bright lights  		  		  			6182  			William E NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1william_e_nde_6182.html  			It was a vision not seen by your eyes. It was a complete soul experience.  		  		  			6184  			Trisha S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1trisha_s_nde.html  			I'm not sure that more vivid is accurate. There were less distractions, but during the event I definitely didn't need my glasses to see what, where, and who. Everything was clear--clearer even than when I where my glasses. (I need glasses for distance and reading and did at that time, too.)  		  		  			6186  			Ryan G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ryan_g_nde.html  			360 degree vision.  		  		  			6192  			George E NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1george_e_nde.html  			My vision during the experience was like being on top of the tallest building in the world in a clear day able to see the entire surroundings up to the horizon.  		  		  			  			  			  			My everyday vision prior to the experience was like being at the bottom of a swimming pool trying to visualize through the water the people walking on the edge of the pool.  		  		  			6195  			Laura B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1laura_b_nde.html  			The light was different. Time seemed to be slowed down during the experience. Immediately before I floated out of my body I seemed to be highly aware of everything.  		  		  			6196  			Lacy NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lacy_nde.html  			Well during the NDE every thing seemed more clear and brighter then here. I was able to see every thing in grate detail.  		  		  			6197  			Earl M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1earl_m_nde.html  			There was no sight, only a pervasive light....everything was a flat, even light, not exceptionally bright, but totally devoid of shadows and contrast  		  		  			6200  			James N NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1james_n_nde.html  			The same...just more relaxed..  		  		  			6205  			Isabel R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1isabel_r_nde.html  			That's a funny question. I was and am very near sighted. Of course I could &quot;see&quot; perfectly without a body or eyes. In fact, when I was on the precipice to the world of lights, I &quot;squinted&quot; so that I could see the lights sort of run together and I thought about a passage in the Bible comparing heaven to a jeweled place. I could see how someone might describe it that way.  		  		  			6206  			Maia S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1maia_s_nde.html  			Everything was in intense focus with surprising luminosity and colour.  		  		  			6207  			Cindy B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1cindy_b_nde.html  			The same  		  		  			6213  			Shea B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1shea_b_nde.html  			I can't say that it seemed much different.  		  		  			6214  			Jane E NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jane_e_nde.html  			the same  		  		  			6215  			Sharon G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sharon_g_nde_6215.html  			vision and hearing acute and focused but no sense of smell  		  		  			6221  			Veronica M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1veronica_m_nde.html  			The only vision that I had was that of the ascending conical structure leading toward the brightest, whitest light that I have ever observed. But more than that it drew me in. It beckonned me to keep coming in it's direction. But I was torn by what was happening around me, especially the siren and my Dad's torment.  		  		  			6222  			Chuck H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1chuck_h_nde.html  			I can't remember  		  		  			6227  			Herman V NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1herman_v_nde.html  			Not sure what you mean by this. It was more of a sense of awareness than vision and that sense was very powerful.  		  		  			6231  			Winnie J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1winnie_j_nde.html  			Probably about the same  		  		  			6233  			Jenneane E NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jenneane_e_nde.html  			My vision at first was like an observer. It is kind of like watching a movie on a screen. It felt like I was sitting like a person would be sitting in a theater watching events but being removed from them. But then at some point when the light got brighter, my feelings seemed to become amplified. Then I felt like I was directly a participant in the movie I was watching. I guess it is kind of difficult to explain that part of it.  		  		  			6238  			Mindy T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1mindy_t_nde.html  			All I saw whas bright white but it was unlike any white I have ever seen.  		  		  			6240  			Nancy T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1nancy_t_nde_6240.html  			Lofty, spiritual, ephemeral,remarkable, vivid, loving , colorful, peaceful, etc.etc!  		  		  			6241  			Laura L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1laura_l_nde.html  			Everything looks as though it has light or is made up of the light  		  		  			6242  			Frances Z NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1frances_z_nde.html  			I became aware of just how bad my Hell really was.  		  		  			6243  			Dan BC NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1dan_bc_nde.html  			I could see everything as clearly as normal  		  		  			6244  			Steve L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1steve_l_nde.html  			I saw nothing  		  		  			6246  			Natalie S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1natalie_s_nde.html  			Why don't you have a comment box for questions 6 and 7? I'm going to comment on those, then answer this question.  		  		  			  			  			  			6. Speed really has nothing to do with it. My thoughts are conceptual, translated down into language (normally). During my experience, my conceptual thoughts were more - deeper, broader, more expansive, more complete.  		  		  			  			  			  			7. Again, this is inaccurate language for me. Not necessarily more vivid, but more closely connected to each other (taste IS touch IS visual IS sound etc). Also richer, which is a form of 'vivid' but not how I would describe it.  		  		  			  			  			  			8. So this question has been answered in my comments about question 7, to some extent. I would say that I was able to ‘see’ anywhere I put my attention, my focus. I didn't ‘look at this’ or ‘look at that’ - all senses were involved in (or the same as) seeing  		  		  			6248  			Lois T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lois_t_nde.html  			They were clearer, like the fog was lifted.  		  		  			6249  			Gary F NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gary_f_nde.html  			i dont remember before it happend to me the accident or running across the road playing but i could see through my soul and the sprits that were standing above me  		  		  			6251  			Paula H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1paula_h_nde.html  			I started wearing glasses all the time at that same age (12), and I remember everything being very sharp, very vivid.  		  		  			6253  			Sara M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sara_m_nde.html  			my vision during the experience was normal compared to everyday vision prior to the experience.  		  		  			6258  			Chris V NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1chris_v_nde.html  			Everything was crystal clear  		  		  			6259  			Maggy C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1maggy_c_nde.html  			I felt more awake.  		  		  			6267  			Sheila EP NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sheila_ep_nde.html  			As described, less constriction.  		  		  			6269  			Rose F NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1rose_f_nde.html  			There was nothing different. It all happened in a matter of seconds. the initial accident that is  		  		  			6274  			Jill J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jill_j_nde.html  			My vision prior to the experience was in and out of consciousness as my cells were not getting enough oxygen. During my experience, my vision was heightened, all my senses were.  		  		  			6275  			Ned D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ned_d_nde.html  			I could see everything very clearly but there seemed to be a 'soft focus' to everything - not a huge softness but a little.  		  		  			6279  			Tara S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1tara_s_nde.html  			During the experience, my vision was heightened. I also feel though that after having my experience, my everyday vision is above what it used to be. I feel that I see everything in life more clearly.  		  		  			6280  			Cory G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1cory_g_nde.html  			I could see 360 degrees and could &quot;be&quot; where ever my thoughts focused.  		  		  			6282  			Gary M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gary_m_nde.html  			I can only say that during the experience everything was heightened, it was on a high level. It felt like everything was brand new instead of having 30 years of wear on it.  		  		  			6283  			Lisa K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lisa_k_nde.html  			I felt that I could see more clearly but in reality I saw nothing but white where I was and saw nothing in the room where my body actually was but I could hear things.  		  		  			6284  			Samuel C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1samuel_c_nde.html  			I can see of no radical difference in vision  		  		  			6286  			Brian G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1brian_g_nde_6286.html  			I could &quot;see&quot; everything (everything that made a difference) from various distances and perspectives.  		  		  			6288  			Anne N NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1anne_n_nde_6288.html  			I was just surprised to be in the room. It was different than anywhere I had been before and somehow I knew it was not the Hospital but that the door was the door to death, but I don't know how I knew that.  		  		  			6289  			Evan B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1evan_b_nde.html  			It was morphed into another sense, one that knew the other dimensions  		  		  			6290  			Joe J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1joe_j_nde.html  			I could see more clear  		  		  			6291  			Enocia J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1enocia_j_nde.html  			No difference.  		  		  			6292  			William W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1william_w_nde_6292.html  			Everything got brighter. The sun light coming though the murky water and the kelp seen to be alive with bubbles coming out of it.  		  		  			6293  			Evie D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1evie_d_nde.html  			I could see things from above or from a more broad perspective instead of just what is in front of me or next to me.  		  		  			6297  			Paula S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1paula_s_nde.html  			everything brighter  		  		  			6303  			Lawrence H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lawrence_h_nde.html  			More positive and reassuring. I used to avoid talking about death, but now I am at peace with it.  		  		  			  			  			  			  		  		  			  			  			  			As far as physical vision I noticed no changes  		  		  			6307  			Darla NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1darla_nde.html  			I don't remember and he drove 8 miles before the accident.

I will answer it as I understand it and hopefully by word context you may understand why this is a confusing question. I consider my what I saw during my NDE a vision for lack of a better word. I do not have visions during the day. I may be influenced by that ACISTE site where visions have a particular meaning. However, I will never forget the experience to the extent I remember it. It was vivid and clear and unforgettable. The only time I ever remember anything that clearly was if it were exceptional such as watching a car crash or having a baby but overtime those stories become what I call the &quot;&quot;Big Fish&quot;&quot; stories. Humans tend to embellish or memories fade or bad memories seem better. My experience/vision has not deviated in fact or memory. My husband of nearly 25 years tells me that it is the only &quot;&quot;story&quot;&quot; I have ever told him that never changes. I do not think he believes me although he says he does. He won't let me speak of it in public and he is tired of hearing about it. OH...I am as blind as a bat without my glasses and I did not have my glasses on and I could see the Operation when I slightly turned my head but did not connect the dots to that was me...and I could see my grandfather very clearly. I never thought about that before this question.  		  		  			6394  			Enrique NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1enrique_nde.html  			The sphere was very vibrant in color..  		  		  			6395  			Marlene S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1marlene_s_nde.html  			Clear and unhindered  		  		  			6396  			Cristael B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1cristael_b_nde.html  			Immediately prior to the experience, I was lying in bed with my eyes closed, trying to find a way to escape from the awful pain I was experiencing.

Everything.  		  		  			6432  			Bonnie W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1bonnie_w_nde.html  			There was nothing to see - just a complete void which, although I describe as 'black' was actually nothing so I don't know how to compare it with human vision.  		  		  			  			  			  			I could 'see' that I was somewhere but not with my eyes because I had no form.  		  		  			6433  			Zachary G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1zachary_g_nde.html  			I never saw... there was no seeing, There were minds, pure consciousness melding with each other directly comunicating by intuition I supose.  		  		  			6436  			HD NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1hd_nde.html  			My vision during the experience at first was blurry, then right when i saw everything it became clear and almost to bright to look at.

Unfortunately, I didn't get to see the Lights or beautiful colors the way other people describe, perhaps because my experience was very brief. I didn't see any 'hellish' visions either.  		  		  			  			  			  			This darkness and the calm about it is hard to describe.  		  		  			6552  			George J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1george_j_nde.html  			Brighter colors  		  		  			6557  			Barry C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1barry_c_nde_6557.html  			If you ever have felt that perfect love surround you, you will never be the same. Immediately prior to that, I was in a rage like I have never been. I felt that I had been betrayed and lied to and cheated on.But when I gave in, and His love just held me and never let go, I felt like I cried all night. In the morning i felt like I was loved like I never knew before. i can remember thinking &quot;OK, so what am I going to do about it&quot;. It as been an ongoing journey ever since.  		  		  			6558  			Mona NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1mona_nde.html  			not as wide, not so pereferial in experience than when normal.  		  		  			6562  			David NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1david_nde_6562.html  			I could see everything with alert Sharpe clarity where as in my daily life I need glasses .  		  		  			6563  			Michael G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1michael_g_nde_6563.html  			Vision was different in that I &quot;knew&quot; where I was and what the landscape was componsed of, but I can't describe any of the details.  		  		  			6564  			Claire B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1claire_b_nde.html  			I could see light in a better quality and everything was so much more clear and distinct than ever.  		  		  			6567  			Carol V NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1carol_v_nde.html  			My vision was beyond words, beyond anything out human minds can comprehend. Example: Here - grainy black &amp; white tiny tv screen of the 50's  		  		  			  			  			  			There - 3 D Technicolor huge IMAX screen where you can almost taste and smell plus feel that you are totally part of the vision experience.  		  		  			6572  			Tommy P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1tommy_p_nde.html  			I can say vision was almost the same.I remember I could feel the wind through my arms and body hair and ears.  		  		  			6573  			Trevor O NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1trevor_o_nde.html  			My vision felt the same. I was seeing all that transpired but at the same time I was experiencing it.

It was the depth of what I felt.  		  		  			6664  			Helen E NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1helen_e_nde.html  			complete vision  		  		  			6665  			Hannah NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1hannah_nde_6665.html  			I could see clearer than ever, individual atoms interacting with each other and the laws of physics working together  		  		  			6667  			Gary NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gary_nde.html  			I had 20/20 vision at the time, and the experience was much more vibrant and real.  		  		  			6672  			Annette Q NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1annette_q_nde.html  			Clear, with clarity of all knowledge  		  		  			6674  			Liam O NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1liam_o_nde.html  			It was hazy at firts as I drifting off with this lovely, peaceful feeeling. Then the images were as clear and rapid as my thoughts in the life review. Then the darkness came, very, very scary.  		  		  			6677  			Caren M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1caren_m_nde_6677.html  			I could see the same, but I was in a different place, a darker place.  		  		  			6678  			Miles NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1miles_nde.html  			I had sight but not through the limitations of my eyes. I felt through the entirety of 'I' and not limited through my body. I had gone from the extreme closed in places, numbness in the vast majority of me and overwhelming exhaustion to this very positive experience. When I came back, the only difference was the exhaustion had started a process of receeding which it continued to do, although the intense thirst I'd felt for many hours prior was still also present; my throat sore and my lips completely cracked and skin dehydrated.  		  		  			6679  			Chad C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1chad_c_nde.html  			I didn't notice any difference.  		  		  			6683  			Renee M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1renee_m_nde.html  			My visions are non Earthly. I see way past the human eye. I am a hypersensitive empath and have heightened Psychic abilities. I have always had this but now study ways to draw it out. I am a born healer.  		  		  			6685  			Fatemeh D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1fatemeh_d_nde.html  			I was quite aware and alert. I was thinking the everyday engagements, even about the e-mails that I should reply, my grandson, etc (at that point, I didn't feel pain because of the pain killers the nurse gave me or added to the serum. And I gadn't been told that the second surgery had also failed. I was I was so alert that, before the nurse bent over me for inesrting the needle in the tube by my neck vein, I felt a little suprised, thinking why she wasn't inserting it in the tube connected to the serum bottle, as she did with the other medicines like antibiotics, pain relieverss, etc. But before I had a chance to ask the question, she inserted the neeedle.  		  		  			6689  			Matt T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1matt_t_nde.html  			Normal in speed, increased emotion, vivid visual, increased mental awareness.  		  		  			6691  			Teri B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1teri_b_nde.html  			the same  		  		  			6692  			Samantha H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1samantha_h_nde.html  			When I came to, I was on the floor and a car was there to take me to the ER.  		  		  			6694  			Kathy K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kathy_k_nde_6694.html  			I was concerned about going swimming there because my Mother had forbid us to  		  		  			  			  			  			EVER go swimming because she was terrified that one of us would drown. Her Dad  		  		  			  			  			  			has worked as a water rescuer and he was called when someone died from drowning  		  		  			  			  			  			and my Mother grew up knowing that when Daddy got his diving gear he was going  		  		  			  			  			  			recover a drowning victim! This created a deep emotional issue for her an we  		  		  			  			  			  			were never allowed to go swimming and we had slipped off and gone swimming.  		  		  			  			  			  			But, even in light of this issue I was not concerned about what would happen  		  		  			  			  			  			if I were to die there in the water that day. There was no fear at all.  		  		  			6696  			Sandi M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sandi_m_nde.html  			no difference  		  		  			6697  			Catherine NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1catherine_nde.html  			Hard to put into words, but vision was more acute in the void, although there was only my mind to look at, otherwise everything else was formless.  		  		  			6698  			Laura P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1laura_p_nde.html  			It was the same  		  		  			6711  			Mark S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1mark_s_nde.html  			Thought processing was much faster as well as my ability to 'checkmark' my bodily damage and know what limbs were left to break in an effort to determine if I'm going to absorb enough energy before dying, to prevent death.  		  		  			6713  			Bonnie C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1bonnie_c_nde_6713.html  			There is a great weight on earth , including learning, working and the physical body. During my experience everything is known and somehow re-instated, I was light, moved fast, all knowing.  		  		  			6715  			Joan K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1joan_k_nde.html  			NOTHING DIFFERENT  		  		  			6716  			Clyde S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1clyde_s_nde.html  			it seemed more accute  		  		  			6730  			Alan G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1alan_g_nde.html  			As I have said , I find it difficult to explain in detail this experience particularly where I was , it just seemed so warm and comfortable , so restful  		  		  			6733  			Jeffrey S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jeffrey_s_nde.html  			The change in vision was how I saw the sky as more blue than ever before.  		  		  			6736  			Judith W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1judith_w_nde.html  			I don't know that I can explain it. I was watching and feeling myself slide downward.  		  		  			6739  			JB Rene A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jb_rene_a_nde.html  			until now,I still asked myself...what was the real purpose why I was already there but I came back to my old material self.  		  		  			6740  			Susan T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1susan_t_nde.html  			My vision before the NDE was normal. I had been awake when I arrived in the OR and was in awe of all the equipment included a huge 6-Screen moitor at the foot of the table. During the NDE everything was pitch black. I saw myself surrounded by a black perimeter that reminded me of bales of hay covered in black plastic. I saw myself calmly laying there alone. Then I saw a white dome at the end where my feet were. It was egg shaped and looked like leaded glass in various shades of white. Everything was black around me. I do remeber the doctors sitting me up on the side of the table (this is when they put a drain in sac aroung my heart to drain the blood): and someone profusely rubbing on my chest and someone doing the same on my back. My veins had already modeled and they were trying to drain the blood from my sac and massage my body. I saw them put 3 tubes down my throat. They looked black to me at the time but, upon waking in my room they were the typical opaque white tubes.  		  		  			6743  			Laura NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1laura_nde.html  			I had never experienced that type of warmth or that color of light, not before nor after the experience. I did lose some mental capacity for a few days. I was frightened afterwards. My brain did not feel up to its usual function.  		  		  			6749  			Anthony N NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1anthony_n_nde_6749.html  			It's as if I was going through life with a sheer curtain over my eyes that was lifted off and has stayed off since then.  		  		  			6758  			Deborah W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1deborah_w_nde.html  			I saw an older woman in a hospital johnnie sitting outside the triage room on a stone bench - as you may see in a park or cemetery. She was just staring at me with no reaction as I was screaming at her to help me. That seemed to last for a long time. My daughter told me months later that she and my granddaughter were with me the whole time - until the diagnosis - and there was never a woman sitting there. I can only say she was an earth angel getting me through.  		  		  			6764  			Greg A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1greg_a_nde.html  			brilliant in every way,sight and sound,emotions.  		  		  			6768  			Rita NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1rita_nde.html  			I could see everything and everyone very fast like a super hero.  		  		  			6769  			Marilyn B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1marilyn_b_nde.html  			I could see but my eyes didnt sting from chlorine  		  		  			6770  			Rachel NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1rachel_nde.html  			The same.  		  		  			6774  			Lauren NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lauren_nde.html  			I don't remember.  		  		  			6776  			Karen R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1karen_r_nde_6776.html  			Much sharper  		  		  			6788  			Kate B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kate_b_nde_6788.html  			It's like seeing clearly to the ends of the world. I wear glasses, and vision here is muddy.  		  		  			6790  			Shana S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1shana_s_nde.html  			Not very detail oriented at eight or even now, but I can recall details of outer body experience.  		  		  			6802  			Garry R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1garry_r_nde.html  			There's really no comparison. Vision during the experience was multidimensional, panoramic. It was a different sense than sight. I could see the walls while at the same time seeking the interior framing, and the outside walls at the se time. It wasn't that the walls were transparent, they appeared normal. Its just that I could see the exterior and interior at the same time.  		  		  			  			  			  			  		  		  			  			  			  			The same sense that produced vision also detected thoughts in others, making it seem that I could &quot;see&quot; what others were thinking.  		  		  			6805  			Bethany R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1bethany_r_nde.html  			Colors, it was the colors that are incomparable and indescribable. And it just was vivid and sharp.  		  		  			6806  			Tonja BB NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1tonja_bb_nde.html  			Well all that I saw was the energy ball with the bright light. I didn't see people or grass and flowers. Just an energy ball of light but it was the most beautiful light I had ever seen.  		  		  			6811  			Peter P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1peter_p_nde.html  			braoder, more detailed. it was like watching on a big screen tv, then being able to zoom in to whatever specific area to see and hear clearly right down to the beads of sweat dripping from someones forhead and hitting the collar of their shirt.  		  		  			6813  			Martin J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1martin_j_nde.html  			I could see clearly without glasses. I could see distant and near without restrictions. In this world I am legally blind even with glasses.  		  		  			6816  			Ekterina R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ekaterina_r_nde.html  			i feel like i'm &quot;seeing&quot; more than the usual like there's another dimension other than the 3 dimensional world we've always known.  		  		  			6820  			Mukurarinda D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1mukurarinda_d_nde.html  			My vision during the experience was a clear one, powerful doable. Today, I may not even know what to do.  		  		  			6823  			Ashutosh S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ashutosh_s_nde.html  			i was normal prior to the incident.i saw devesh holding my neck tight but within few moments i got a black out  		  		  			6824  			Jim T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jim_t_nde.html  			My vision did not seem any different than my normal vision. I saw no vivid colors or lights that so many describe b  		  		  			6828  			Frank R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1frank_r_nde.html  			Vision was same although for some reason the light was not blinding in a physical sense  		  		  			6829  			Marilyn C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1marilyn_c_nde.html  			I can't say there was any vision, just awareness. I KNEW what it looked like and what I was. I saw it in my thoughts. I didn't see it with my eyes, I just knew.  		  		  			6832  			Sara G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sara_g_nde.html  			Colors were more colorful and brilliant.  		  		  			6836  			Karin S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1karin_s_nde.html  			Limited vs limitless  		  		  			  			  			  			It was normal. The idea of comparison did not exist.  		  		  			6839  			Carl S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1carl_s_nde.html  			It was like I was thinking and processing information in my mind with just me and no other stimulation.  		  		  			6841  			Patricia C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1patricia_c_nde_6841.html  			Things are sharper, clearer and more clear cut. There was no coulours. Just darkness and light. No noise. But the light is so bright, and the darkness so dark.  		  		  			6843  			Irene O NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1irene_o_nde.html  			Normally, I cannot see and hear other people around me all at the same time. I have to filter out background to be able to pay attention to what is going on right in front of me.  		  		  			6846  			Rhea T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1rhea_t_nde.html  			I could only see the light figures. I couldn't see any &quot;real&quot; people around me.  		  		  			6847  			Charles P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1charles_p_nde_6847.html  			Intense acuity to the sights and sounds around me. Deep thoughts of morality and responsibility almost religious in nature. Increased powers of observation and connecting thoughts having to do with the nature of my life, the environment and my senses. The inevitable conflict between reality and vision. The belief that not everything is explainable given my lack of knowledge and understanding of how the universe works. The feeling that light and color had meaning, white being soft and comforting green being life.  		  		  			6848  			Joseph C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1joseph_c_nde_6848.html  			Everything seemed brighter.  		  		  			6853  			Mattie K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1mattie_k_nde.html  			My whole life playd clear and vivid in a flash.  		  		  			6861  			Loni C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1loni_c_nde.html  			Vision appeared to be 20/20, but it seems that you can look at things, focus on them, and you can see &quot;into&quot; them, to any depth, even microscopic.  		  		  			6863  			Sarah NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sarah_nde_6863.html  			I don't recall seeing much more than the glowing light. It was a full sensory experience.  		  		  			6865  			Hope C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1hope_c_nde.html  			The colors of the boxes were very bright. So bright they illuminated before me that everything around them was dark and shadows.  		  		  			6866  			Meg C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1meg_c_nde.html  			Everything was crisp, sharp and glowing during my experience. I could not only see it with my eyes (altho I was unaware of my eyes and my body) but I also felt it with my senses. The visuals had emotions contained within them.  		  		  			6867  			Blanca A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1blanca_a_nde.html  			My vision was extra clean, clear of any obstruction. In terms of sight I have always had hazy vision, I wear glasses for reading and long distance. I also have glare which usually makes me squint my eyes when there is a bright light. But during the experience, I didn't experience any trouble with my vision. I was able to see clearly, even the brightness was not a problem.  		  		  			6871  			Olivia S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1olivia_s_nde.html  			I would say it was significantly more aware and vivid at that time.  		  		  			6880  			Ginnie E NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ginnie_e_nde.html  			I was acutely aware of being without form.  		  		  			6881  			Maria SV NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1maria_sv_nde.html  			my speed up thoughts came in two ocassions,when i was denying to come back that light made me see in high speed a pic of my two sons on earth and then when I woke up, I saw all events in my near death experience coming to my head in a very high speed again.  		  		  			  			  			  			My thoughts in real life are and were like matching with events...and very much slower,according to what I live,like same time graduation,I dont know how to explain it more clearly.  		  		  			6882  			Avery D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1avery_d_nde.html  			once again very clear  		  		  			6885  			Sarah P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sarah_p_nde.html  			Well, the thought or angel or whatever it was that indicated: &quot;I am dead&quot; maybe was a more mature or ? &quot;voice&quot;, and I was fully engaged and aware and clearly seeing, from a distance but above, it seemed, to be viewing my teenage body..I still have a vague recollection of what I saw..I mean the position of my body, and that it appeared to be at the bottom of water, resting like a heavy weight would, NOT floating through ugly dark foaming waters..and also a bit of empathy for the poor child lying there dead! I didn't ever see the movie &quot;the body snatchers&quot; but there's something that went on that day...  		  		  			6896  			Joan LH NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1joan_lh_nde.html  			I did not have any vision during my experience.

The vision was clear, very clear, calm, silent, then back to my body. It was liken I was watching myself die and it was clear and not scary. Sharp colorful.   		  		  			7004  			Connie C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1connie_c_nde.html  			I accepted what was occurring completely--even more than I might accept &quot;reality&quot; during daily life.  		  		  			7014  			Duane H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1duane_h_nde.html  			No vision. A sense of well being.  		  		  			7036  			Gabriel NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gabriel_nde.html  			normal  		  		  			7048  			Danee C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1danee_c_nde.html  			I had no vision everything was dark.  		  		  			7053  			Eruera M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1eruera_m_nde.html  			Everything prior to the NDE was compartmentalised, I was myself and people were themselves, the only relationship between us was we were human. No connection between anything other than the categories I was taught at school.  		  		  			7054  			Gillian M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gillian_m_nde.html  			Sphere of perception rather than binocular vision. Colors more brilliant. Complete surround awareness.  		  		  			7057  			Lani K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lani_k_nde.html  			That's interesting. I have constant Auras now because of extreme migraines, and it's hard to think of my vision before the accident. Perception is more alert and vivid, but my actually vision has lessened since the accident.  		  		  			7060  			Donald C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1donald_c_nde.html  			Vision seemed to be like trough a wide angel lens. At one point while watching eveyone rushing to my aid, I was also aware of a gentleman looking into the engine of a car across the lawn next door, whom also ran over to me. A good 100 yards away.  		  		  			7064  			Donna J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1donna_j_nde.html  			Unaware of all the activity on the beach. I don't even have a memory of who the children were that I was in the water with. During the experience, I remember everything.  		  		  			7066  			Terry B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1terry_b_nde_7066.html  			no comparision-as if I had 360 degree during  		  		  			7068  			Walter N NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1walter_n_nde.html  			I had bits and pieces of a vision before the experience, but now everything has become more acutely aware.  		  		  			7069  			Julie K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1julie_k_nde.html  			All I could see was darkness with a void of light, so it was like black and white, except the white was strangely illuminated.  		  		  			7074  			Harris B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1harris_b_nde.html  			no different, just from a higher vantage point, maybe 5 feet above my prone body and a few feet above the emergency squad EMTs  		  		  			7086  			Jill W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jill_w_nde.html  			Sharp vision.  		  		  			7089  			Sara J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sara_j_nde.html  			I could see what was going on wherever I wanted to without my physical body being there. I could travel to see my parents even though my body was lying in a clinic. I could also see things such as a light and a tunnel which are not visible in the everyday world.  		  		  			7092  			Neerie NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1neerie_nde.html  			The vision was the same.  		  		  			7095  			Brandon C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1brandon_c_nde.html  			I could see in this &quot;darkness&quot;, though, there was nothing to see. I didn't bother looking at myself because I knew somehow that I was not made of a physical body.  		  		  			7098  			Nigel O NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1nigel_o_nde.html  			I had and still have excellent vision the experiance changed nothing  		  		  			7105  			Tammy H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1tammy_h_nde.html  			The same  		  		  			7108  			Rosemary L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1rosemary_l_nde.html  			My vision was misty, I could not make out the faces of the forms surrounding me. Unlike some people who have gone through this, I did not recognize any loved ones...only that there were &quot;spirits&quot; or beings arund me in this sepia color.  		  		  			7109  			Catherine A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1catherine_a_nde_7109.html  			this happened in my childhood. but has effected my everyday experiences my whole life. I am very intuitive and sensitive to people. I have a sixth sense about people. I was this way since I left the hospital 40 years ago. I am able to see beyond peoples fears and into the core of most issues.  		  		  			7111  			Marshall L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1marshall_l_nde.html  			Sometimes I would see things like in a fast forward mode and other time during the flashes in slow motion.  		  		  			7116  			Lauren K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lauren_k_nde.html  			Prior to the accident I was a &quot;wild child&quot; taking chances, saying things like &quot;This joke will kill you.&quot;  		  		  			  			  			  			Afterwards I realized these bodies are a gift and to take life more seriously. I also found meditation which helps me to reconnect to my higher self.  		  		  			7118  			Brenda S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1brenda_s_nde.html  			Heavenly beautiful  		  		  			7131  			Justin M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1justin_m_nde_7131.html  			it was real, more real than a dream or day dream, more real than life its self  		  		  			7145  			Haze NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1haze_nde.html  			not sure but was scary right befor  		  		  			7147  			Witney NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1witney_nde.html  			Well I couldn't really see anything. It was dark.  		  		  			7148  			David M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1david_m_nde_7148.html  			More faded than usual. My mental image was sharper then my vision.  		  		  			7149  			Gene B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gene_b_nde.html  			My vision was more acute during the experience.  		  		  			7151  			Sally D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sally_d_nde.html  			Well, that is a tough one...  		  		  			  			  			  			Since I had no eye opening x many hours even after this event, I'm not sure why I have such awareness of visual images and beauty.  		  		  			  			  			  			So, although my actual vision would not be applicable, the visions I was having were incredibly vivid.  		  		  			  			  			  			Very hard to explain...  		  		  			7153  			Romy NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1romy_nde.html  			My vision expanded- as if I zoomed out and could see a lot more things, also happening at once. I could control the zooming in and out and it seemed wherever I would look, wherever my awareness took me- that's where I would go.  		  		  			  			  			  			After I woke up, for the first hour I could see &quot;things&quot; in the air, my mind couldn't understand what they were.  		  		  			7155  			Cali NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1cali_nde.html  			My vision during the experience did not seem to have much depth of field. It was focused on me and my mother. My vision immediately prior was kind of like being drunk. That is the closes thing I can compare insulin shock too. Sometimes things spin, can't remember if it did that but the view during insulin shock tends to be disoriented.  		  		  			7157  			Kathy VB NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kathy_vb_nde.html  			I was able to see the shore line from where I was (very far out), and also from right above the beach as if I were flying overhead.  		  		  			7159  			Timothy A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1timothy_a_nde.html  			I have always had 20 20 vision. During the event I felt like I could see everything in front of me, its hard to explain. Colors popped. It looked clear the clearest I have ever seen. Almost magnified.  		  		  			7166  			Serge D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1serge_d_nde.html  			my vision is sharp, I see in the dark, I can focus on small objects what other do not see.... I see more what normals are able to see...  		  		  			7170  			Mary W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1mary_w_nde_7170.html  			I had been &quot; kooky&quot; prior to this experience from high fever, concussion &amp; narcotics they had me on, after this experience I started to heal &amp; remember things.Prior to this experience my husband was called &amp; told to come immediately I was &quot;dying&quot;  		  		  			7172  			Steve T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1steve_t_nde_7172.html  			I was more aware of all than I ever have been but I only remember ny own fathers face ,, Others were there but further back ..  		  		  			7175  			Ivan NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ivan_nde.html  			Heightened, naturally so.  		  		  			7177  			Rebecca P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1rebecca_p_nde.html  			My vision was only of darkness.  		  		  			7179  			Maime S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1maime_s_nde.html  			There is no comparison. Vision in our earth bodies is so limited to the vision you experience outside of the confinement of the body.  		  		  			7180  			Bonnie C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1bonnie_c_nde.html  			Vision was the only sense I had. It was central, forward, no peripheral and clear, sharp, with a very pleasant white light. The only colors I saw was the white light and the black &quot;pathway.&quot; It felt like pure, unadulterated vision.  		  		  			7181  			Kristine J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kristine_j_nde.html  			It was not &quot;unusual&quot;, nothing seemed strange even though it had many elements that aren't &quot;normal&quot;. I was seeing the future (apparently) seeing things without physically being there, and seeing a morphing iridescent rectangle that I completely accepted, it made perfect sense even though I am not sure anyone else would have or could have seen it too. I could zoom in or out without moving, jut thinking could give me different angles. But again this seemed more normal than what we have while alive.  		  		  			7182  			Marny NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1marny_nde.html  			More vivid.  		  		  			7188  			Ronnie D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ronnie_d_nde.html  			Vision was the same but my awareness was not.  		  		  			7196  			Rebekah J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1rebekah_j_nde.html  			It was so sharp. I had very poor eyesight as a child and could not see without my glasses but I didn't need them in the tunnel  		  		  			7198  			Kate NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kate_nde.html  			felt what I saw  		  		  			7199  			James A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1james_a_nde.html  			Blacked out. Non existent.  		  		  			7200  			Michael DP NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1michael_dp_nde.html  			It was normal  		  		  			7201  			Micella NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1micella_nde.html  			Everything seemed vibrant, but it was relatively the same as a usual pastoral scene.  		  		  			7202  			Hannah F NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1hannah_f_nde.html  			I'm not sure there was much difference.  		  		  			7203  			Amanda NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1amanda_nde.html  			Colors were brighter.  		  		  			7208  			Francis G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1francis_g_nde.html  			wow day verse night- the issue was no one wanted to allow me to speak of it  		  		  			7209  			Robyn F NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1robyn_f_nde.html  			I &quot;saw&quot; with something other than my physical eyes. I was in another realm of existence altogether.  		  		  			7210  			Michael Joseph NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1michael_joseph_nde.html  			Uhhh I saw colors I've never seen before and saw into realms of existence that people don't even know exist.  		  		  			7216  			Ray NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ray_nde.html  			During the experience, all components around me were very clear and vivid. For example; inspite of everything happening so quickly I managed to see small details about the car that hit me, including the people inside the car itself.  		  		  			7219  			Gail A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gail_a_nde.html  			I didn't have vision in the traditional sense, I seen things and beings with my whole being.  		  		  			7220  			Rachel R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1rachel_r_nde.html  			I saw everything from the center of my body.  		  		  			7234  			Penny C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1penny_c_nde.html  			I don't remember the colors, or background whether it was dark or light, or the environment while meeting with my deceased family members, but I saw everyone clearly. Back in my body it was normal it's just that I was on earth back in my body.  		  		  			7237  			Malavika H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1malavika_h_nde.html  			I didn't see the earth or people around me like most people have. But when I met my grandmom I could see everything clearly, even clearer than the vision I have on earth. It was as if everything was hd, that's the best I could describe it.  		  		  			7238  			Francesca NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1francesca_nde.html  			It didn't feeling anything emotionally while I watched myself and I didn't feeling anything when I saw the emergency vehicles.  		  		  			7245  			Brenda R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1brenda_r_nde.html  			My vision was very clear until coming back through the 'tunnel.' Then it seemed like things were speeding up and I was going backward in time seeing some things of my future, until we were over the top of the hospital. I could clearly see the roof, and the stuff on the top of the rooms like air ventilators and I could see the high school across the street. Even when I was in Heaven, the people did not have bodies like you and me now but I cannot explain how I knew them.  		  		  			7251  			Mary C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1mary_c_nde.html  			It was dark when I went through the ice and darker under the ice. My eyes were likely closed in the water but I was bathed in light. I don't remember seeing anything but the light.  		  		  			7252  			Andrea J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1andrea_j_nde.html  			It was normal  		  		  			7260  			Glen D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1glen_d_nde.html  			I wear glasses, and didn't have them on during the event. Yet I was able to see with pinpoint accuracy things I cannot typically see, even with my glasses.  		  		  			7263  			Sonya M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sonya_m_nde.html  			I never saw beauty in the color spectrum before then it is almost like a fog lifted  		  		  			7264  			Daniel H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1daniel_h_nde.html  			I was a typical 12 year old kid with no knowledge of what was going to happen in the future.  		  		  			7265  			Sally A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sally_a_nde_7265.html  			I doubt I will experience that awesome feeling on all levels ever in normal life.  		  		  			7271  			Salem NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1salem_nde.html  			&quot;  		  		  			7274  			Tommye R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1tommye_r_nde.html  			I saw normally during the experience.  		  		  			7275  			Jo B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jo_b_nde.html  			My vision was mildly diminished only because other sensations were so intense as to make vision less emphasized.  		  		  			7277  			Haley T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1haley_t_nde.html  			There was foggy confusion and chaos before but enlightened fulfillment and joy during.  		  		  			7278  			Samson J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1samson_j_nde.html  			Seemed to be the same - but I DID NOT look down and see my self or anything like that - attention was focused on the &quot;light.&quot;  		  		  			7284  			Carmen V Shared NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1carmen_v_nde.html  			It was dream-like, except it hasn't faded from my memory.  		  		  			7291  			Karin F NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1karin_f_nde.html  			Colors were more brilliant  		  		  			7297  			Jeremiah J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jeremiah_j_nde.html  			Vision seemed to be about the same. What I was seeing was much different. I could not actual see any type of body I was in.  		  		  			7303  			Bella J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1bella_j_nde.html  			Unblinded to 'everything'. It was like seeing and being aware of everything around me concurrently.  		  		  			7307  			Tina G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1tina_g_nde.html  			Same  		  		  			7313  			Jacqueline HW NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jacqueline_hw_nde.html  			The only way that I can answer that question, it that it is like you are wearing rose colored glasses. The brightness and beauty of everything is extreme. When you come back to your body, those glasses are taken off, and the world looks duller.  		  		  			7314  			Wendy A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1wendy_a_nde.html  			I was able to see things that were happening in the room when I was unconscious...such as my roommate being comforted and escorted from the room.  		  		  			7316  			Ken D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ken_d_nde_7316.html  			Everything was crystal clear and very detailed  		  		  			7317  			Martha BG NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1martha_bg_nde.html  			My vision was extremely sensitive to the bright light or aura surrounding the group.  		  		  			7318  			Alta NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1alta_nde.html  			My vision of the seen and unseen world was not the same. I did not use my eyes to see the light. I felt with my whole being, my soul.  		  		  			7319  			Beth S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1beth_s_nde.html  			I didn't need to see with my eyes. I saw with my mind.  		  		  			7325  			Marie W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1marie_w_nde.html  			When one of the Archangels waved their arm and opened the matrix of creation before me and I was standing there beside them as they explained it to me and I was looking right into the matrix it did alter my vision. prior to the experience I wore glasses, afterward I could see clearly without them for the first year. Afterward light hurt my eyes and I wore dark sunglasses not just sunlight but indoor lighting as well.  		  		  			7329  			Wendy T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1wendy_t_nde.html  			my eyesight seemed the same.  		  		  			7331  			Cassandra P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1cassandra_p_nde.html  			I was not aware of thoughts speeding up, just of the speed at which I was travelling up the light shaft, so I assume my thoughts werefaster.  		  		  			  			  			  			My vision was all of the blue light - trying to make out my bedroom so far away was because of the distance and speed. I was so ill before the light struck me that my thoughts, vision and senses must have been sluggish and blurred.  		  		  			7335  			Wanda K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1wanda_k_nde.html  			It really wasn't a vision but more a sense of being.  		  		  			7336  			Cyanrose J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1cyanrose_j_nde.html  			I had not given thought to such things. Although, after telling my mother of my experience afterward, my mother described having a similar experience when My eldest sister died at birth. She assured me &quot;my baby was in heaven.&quot;  		  		  			  			  			  			My mother was in a coma for three weeks when, &quot;Her baby girl(my sister) was full term but stillborn. She described her own deceased mother to be smiling, dressed in pure white robes as she took the infant into her arms and walked away into what my mother felt was heaven. She had always referred to her mother as &quot;an Angel on earth-when living.&quot;  		  		  			7340  			William H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1william_h_nde_7340.html  			Without eyes &amp; body, vision is difficult word. Best compared to dream images.  		  		  			7342  			Olivia E NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1olivia_e_nde.html  			I have no memory prior to this event. This is not, I imagine, something you would think could happen to an infant??

My thoughts were not defined by speed. My thoughts were everywhere at once. Speed was not an option. My senses were not limited to the human body. Sound was not of the ear. It was of the soul. Vision was not of the eyeball. It was all knowing, all encompassing. Vision of the eyeballs is blurry or sharply focused. My vision was not limited like that. My emotions were a sense, where-as we do not recognize them this way in the human body on earth. At least not in America. Touch was a vibration versus our usual outer tactile feeling. Before my experience, vision was about the separation of color, space, contour, shade, distance, textures. During the experience my vision was about me being the make up of all existence.  		  		  			7555  			Rachel G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1rachel_g_nde.html  			Colours appears brighter than usual.  		  		  			7558  			Kevin S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kevin_s_nde.html  			DO not remember anything before the accident so I can not tell you my experience with my vision  		  		  			7574  			Chanse R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1chanse_r_nde.html  			Same vision but not on the earth but in space.  		  		  			7575  			Hailey M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1hailey_m_nde.html  			The best way I can explain it is it was like being in a dream state, where you are conscious and have the ability to see and think but do not have a physical form connected to that consciousness and there is so much more than we can possibly conceive. Everything was ultra clear and it was like seeing everything at once. Before the incident I was a very questioning person, I wanted to believe but I felt I needed proof and as soon as I had it, it changed everything.  		  		  			7578  			Scott W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1scott_w_nde.html  			I can't compare it to anything..

WHEREAS... during the death experience... there was no physical world, just 'The Pure Love Presence' and what I could 'see' of that Presence was just an All-pervasive white Brilliance, like a zillion sparkling diamonds sparkling... and which was infinite... no beginning nor end... that It was completely Still and yet, so totally alive and Full of everything and everyone... all of creation was in every particle of its Light.  		  		  			7603  			Mindy B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1mindy_b_nde.html  			After the experience there was something about lights.

Everything seemed so miniscule in comparison to what awaited us in the other dimension. Everything began seeming like such white noise and nonsense. I didn't see the meaning in much of what our society seems to distract people with.  		  		  			7701  			Saurabh C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1saurabh_c_nde.html  			like being in normal world and being in a fluid but still breathing.  		  		  			7711  			Udaya N NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1udaya_n_nde.html  			same  		  		  			7714  			Katie E NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1katie_e_nde.html  			I can't remember any difference in vision.  		  		  			7716  			Elizabeth T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1elizabeth_t_nde.html  			It was good, my vision.  		  		  			7717  			Alex H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1alex_h_nde.html  			Ihad perfect eyesight normally, but during the experience dverything looked very, very bright.  		  		  			7719  			Shawn C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1shawn_c_nde.html  			It was surreal,  		  		  			7724  			Stephanie R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1stephanie_r_nde_7724.html  			When I came back into my body, for a moment everything looked as usual except people.

During my experience, the light was pure yet soft. Things were sharp yet out of focus somewhat when looking at the group of people. I could make out bodies or figures yet really not in well defined focus, standing upright yet not standing on anything. I was sort of just floating towards them slowly and I could hear them yelling or talking that I was not to be here yet I still remember that I heard that, but yet I did not hear it.  		  		  			7743  			Duane S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1duane_s_nde.html  			It seemed like I had a total focus on whatever was happening at that moment. It was an all or nothing thing, my mind dealt with one item at a time. However I didn't have the feeling of seeing or vision I was just part of a whole.  		  		  			7747  			Jeanne MK NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jeanne_mk_nde.html  			incredible  		  		  			7750  			Erica P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1erica_p_nde.html  			My vision is some what blurry but not when I had my near death experience  		  		  			7752  			Vikki H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1vikki_h_nde.html  			I had no vision.

I can't even open my eyes really in a pool but in a beach it was always impossible, not that day.  		  		  			7764  			John D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1john_d_nde_7764.html  			Only saw a too bright light.  		  		  			7771  			GaeLawree C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gaelawree_c_nde.html  			it was on a totally different level of conscienceness.  		  		  			7772  			Deborah H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1deborah_h_nde.html  			My vision was heightened and able to see colors and shapes better.  		  		  			7775  			Laura C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1laura_c_nde.html  			It seemed the same  		  		  			7779  			William L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1william_l_nde_7779.html  			It's not vision.

There was no light in my world. I existed. I made it through the day and didn't even bother to wonder when I would next be hit, slapped, grounded, yelled at, put down, denied any freedom. I didn't feel like a person. During and after the experience I felt validated as a worthy human being. It didn't change anything at home but it changed how I viewed myself internally.  		  		  			7923  			Kasia B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kasia_b_nde.html  			Just clearer  		  		  			7924  			Dale B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1dale_b_nde.html  			no comparison.... no mortality...  		  		  			7927  			Michelle B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1michelle_b_nde.html  			The light during the experience was so bright it was very hard to see where it began and ended, in my everyday life my vision would have been able to conceive if the light was the sun or a lamp.  		  		  			7930  			Paul D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1paul_d_nde.html  			during experience : radiance. after : normal  		  		  			7936  			Sharon D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sharon_d_nde_7936.html  			There was a huge difference.

I could see what was happening down the hall, in a Heaven like place while I saw 100's of deceased spirits and what was going on with my daughter in another room, along with everything happening in the OR after I flatlined. Vivid-- I could taste, smell, hear at a level that was thousands of feet of vibration above where I used to feel.  		  		  			7977  			Becky M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1becky_m_nde.html  			My grandma helped me understand  		  		  			7981  			Steven D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1steven_d_nde.html  			I could see but could feel what I saw as well  		  		  			7985  			Banu U NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1banu_u_nde.html  			Any of the word in this world is not enough to explain the vision and the feeling.

I've gone over it thousands of times because of all the things that were fortold that have come true, and all the lessons I have learned over the years that I did not grasp at the time.  		  		  			8029  			Robert N NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1robert_n_nde_8029.html  			Vision seemed very acute and colors were more intense.  		  		  			8030  			Norman R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1norman_r_nde.html  			I can't completely speak to that. I know that later after I awoke from the coma, I could feel/sense/see the bubble of protection around the ICU medical ward. After I awoke, I saw my (then) wife, and saw a white aura around her head. Could it have been the sun in the window outside? I didn't know.  		  		  			8031  			Tracy R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1tracy_r_nde.html  			I have perfect vision. had perfect vision up until taking the pills.

I knew intellectually about God's love but this experience gave me a spiritual sense of it that is as strong today as it was during this experience. I KNOW God and His love for myself and others, rather than have read about it. It is very very REAL.

I think of the Earth as a dark place that is being illuminated - had I never seen light I could only guess at what the experience of colour means or feels like.  		  		  			  			  			  			In contrast, the otherworldly (non?-)space I experienced seemed to be undifferentiated infinity, like a swirling cloud, illuminated by an altogether different kind of light. Nothing was 'visible', but the illuminating force certainly implied benevolence, and may have been love.  		  		  			8141  			Karen M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1karen_m_nde_8141.html  			I could 'see' everything.

During the accident, it would not be my eye site vision. I was under the horse, and I could not see anything. Internal image though could be described in stages. Firstly all went completely white and clear. Same happened to my brains- all went white, clear and very quiet. Then I saw dark tunnel and the brightest light. My vision was very vivid.  		  		  			8151  			Jeremy NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jeremy_nde.html  			Vision was enhanced.

My vision... I was aware of things around me, in great detail, however, I cannot say for sure that I was seeing these with my eyes. If vision is limited to only what is perceived through my eyes and interpreted by my brain, i honestly cannot comment on, however, if vision includes what I understood, then this is a much wider and deeper phenomenon.  		  		  			8157  			Pat S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1pat_s_nde.html  			It was if it were magnified a hundred fold.  		  		  			8159  			Paul G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1paul_g_nde_8159.html  			Same as section #3 above, except that you did not have to physically turn your head to see with your eyes because you had full knowledge of your surroundings.  		  		  			8163  			Kari W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kari_w_nde.html  			My vision was full of peace and comfort, it was actually exciting to swim and breathe under water. The light gave me something to swim towards; the boys were no longer a concern. Just prior to the experience I was desparately searching for air, panicked, gasping, wanting to tell them I couldn't breathe, this is not fun! Why are you laughing, can't you see I'm in trouble?  		  		  			8166  			Bobbie K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1bobbie_k_nde_8166.html  			I was aware of being in water and thinking that I could breathe underwater.

That said, vision before and after my experience is all about the details of time and space. Things have gravity and mass in the human realm. In my experience gravity, mass and space did not exist, but that didn't make things less real. For example, the three entities I saw. They had form, but they were devoid of any details. I can't tell you what color they were, what their clothes were made of, or even if they had faces, but they had a strong energetic presence.  		  		  			8195  			William C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1william_c_nde.html  			everything seemed very clear as if a veil had been lifted and i could know or express anything instantly with clarity and purity. no miscommunication or misunderstandings.  		  		  			8211  			Mark B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1mark_b_nde.html  			Very clear.

The only thing I can't explain is the person I saw next to my hospital bed entering the OR. My vision was fuzzy because I wasn't not wearing any corrective lenses, as well as severe tunnel vision, but this figure, I saw as clearly as the other doctors and nurses.  		  		  			8232  			Angela G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1angela_g_nde.html  			My awareness ..  		  		  			8240  			Stuart C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1stuart_c_nde.html  			It was perfect vision, everything was really clear  		  		  			8243  			Marty D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1marty_d_nde.html  			ordinary/perfect  		  		  			8249  			Dana M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1dana_m_nde.html  			As I said before, immediately prior to the occurrence I felt very tired, disconnected from my body and from what was happening around me. I knew I was very sick. I had been sick many times during the previous year, so being sick was not unusual. But feeling the way I felt was VERY unusual. I can't remember ever feeling that disconnected before.  		  		  			8250  			Karen T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1karen_t_nde.html  			I am normally very near sighted and my glasses had been removed before surgery, but I was able to see things within the hospital as clearly as if I had my glasses on. When on the 'other side', I was able to see with an intensity of color and range of vision that I had never before been able to do.  		  		  			8251  			Susanne S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1susanne_s_nde.html  			We focus on outer beauty here, inner beauty shines brighter there in the form of light and love.

This vision didn't feel like it was using my eyes. And it was non-directional. I could see every direction all at once. It wasn't even as if i saw from once central place - it felt like i could see from multiple places at once. Everything was also much much sharper. When i saw some shapes unfolding before me they had incredible detail and sharpness, greater than anything my eyes could ever see. It was like i could zoom in onto them forever, and the closer i looked at these shapes the more and more detail unfolded. Endlessly.  		  		  			8354  			Heidi C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1heidi_c_nde.html  			I saw colors that don't exist here and there are no words to describe them.  		  		  			8356  			David L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1david_l_nde_8356.html  			AT PEACE  		  		  			8362  			Dyan K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1dyan_k_nde.html  			Green things that were alive glowed for weeks after.

I don't recall focusing my vision on anything except that silver cord. Everything else was there, and clear, but somehow not as 'real' as that tightly-stretched glowing silver cord. That was more real to me, and more important to me, than anything else. I was almost completely focused on not breaking it.  		  		  			8545  			James R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1james_r_nde_8545.html  			The clarity....

It was an experience that went through my whole being.  		  		  			8557  			Paige V NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1paige_v_nde.html  			I could see very clearly I was floating up into the sky, I could not see my body or the man choking me. When I was told 'not yet' everything was very grey until I regained my bodily senses.  		  		  			8558  			Samia NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1samia_nde.html  			normal  		  		  			8559  			Jeff H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jeff_h_nde.html  			I experience things much more slowly here, and over there it was as though vast amounts of time and experiences were translated in a thought, or an instant- just simply an understanding of so much more than I can express here.  		  		  			8562  			Richard G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1richard_g_nde_8562.html  			This vision is imprinted in me to the end.  		  		  			8564  			Gary F NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gary_f_nde_8564.html  			My vision did change.

I wear glasses in this reality but there the most minute details were distinct. I could see clearly in my mothers dark bedroom without any problem.  		  		  			8587  			Jeet P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jeet_p_nde.html  			no different  		  		  			8588  			Anne L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1anne_l_nde_8588.html  			Everything was dark but the emotions were much more intense.  		  		  			8594  			Charles T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1charles_t_nde_8594.html  			High definition doesnt even begin to describe the clarity in which I was able to see. I had PRK surgery done on both eyes. PRK is the predecessor to LASIK. Due to damage from small pieces of steel being drilled out of my eyes, they were not able to be corrected back to 20/20. Yet I saw as if I had ultra 4k definition vision. The highest tech 4k ultra HD tv cant hold a candle to the way I was able to see there.  		  		  			8596  			Anthony M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1anthony_m_nde_8596.html  			As noted above it felt like the ground and sky were radiating warmth and the colors were more vivid like pastels in a painting.  		  		  			8597  			Sharon T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sharon_t_nde.html  			My vision seemed very sensitive to small details.  		  		  			8600  			Van S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1van_s_nde.html  			it was night time and after the accident it was well lit with rays of light in the vaulted room.  		  		  			8603  			Douglas B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1douglas_b_nde.html  			was more clear, all things were in focus regardless of distance, and there seemed to be infinite depth  		  		  			8604  			Alma B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1alma_b_nde.html  			My vision right before the NDE was that of bleak light, sadness dimmed everything.

I was witnessing another reality, without shadows or doubts.  		  		  			8648  			Jo H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jo_h_nde_8648.html  			I felt everyone around me  		  		  			8651  			Jenny L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jenny_l_nde.html  			I feel like it was the same.  		  		  			8655  			Matthew S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1matthew_s_nde.html  			No comparison you could see God in all things.  		  		  			8657  			Ryan J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ryan_j_nde.html  			same as normal.  		  		  			8659  			Sandra M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sandra_m_nde.html  			I had a better than birds eye view.  		  		  			8661  			Dan M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1dan_m_nde.html  			Nothing to compare, I felt physical ill before and was unconscious  		  		  			8680  			Lauren J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lauren_j_nde.html  			In my vision, I saw everything. Noticed every detail. Everything was sharp and clear except around the edges, where it was slightly hazy. I'm normally pretty observant in life, but this was magnified somehow. Like I'd imagine people feel when they're on drugs or something...  		  		  			8681  			Lyle H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lyle_h_nde.html  			It was if I could see sound with my eyes.  		  		  			8688  			Jim B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jim_b_nde_8688.html  			I could see the life and purpose within things.  		  		  			8694  			Jon M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jon_m_nde.html  			Didn't really see it was all feels.  		  		  			8697  			Catherine NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1catherine_nde_8697.html  			Clear with another level of depth  		  		  			8698  			Edward C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1edward_c_nde.html  			During my experience colors were more vivid very beautiful colors. And I could see everything with clarity everything was clear vision.  		  		  			8699  			Charles K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1charles_k_nde.html  			expanded and then focusing on my wife.  		  		  			8702  			Jack J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jack_j_nde.html  			Just felt free  		  		  			8704  			Meghan NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1meghan_nde.html  			The best way I can describe it is being in a haze. People were moving slower than usual but with urgency still.  		  		  			8711  			Kathy O NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kathy_o_nde.html  			Everything was in more vibrant colors once I stepped out of my body. Everything had more detail. Hard to describe.  		  		  			8718  			Laurence B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1laurence_b_nde.html  			I must have blacked out from drinking and drove into a tree. Spiritually every thing looked clear. My experience was feeling and knowing.I am and was a very kinesthetic person.  		  		  			8724  			Telesa H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1telesa_h_nde.html  			Colors were brighter I didn't just experience my NDE I sensed the experience. Every vision I was shown was so brilliant and the light was so blindingly bright it took my mind a few moments to embrace it..  		  		  			8726  			William R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1william_r_nde_8726.html  			Vision was always the same before, during and after.

Maybe the body and language hinder us or make dull things down  		  		  			8748  			Kathleen B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kathleen_b_nde_8748.html  			My vision seemed more acute as I remember it. Now when I look at something I see an object or a person, etc. Then it was like was part of the experience, like it was one connected universe and I was a part of it.  		  		  			8751  			Gary G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gary_g_nde.html  			very good  		  		  			8753  			Stanley S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1stanley_s_nde.html  			Vision is not with eyes.

I do not know whether it was due to the fact that the light was just not an earthly light. Plus, as I said, my visual field was more restricted than in real life. I could not look around. My body did not exist, thus it is not like I could turn my head. Everything that existed was right in front of my eyes, and I had no choice but looking at it. I am not sure I really perceived my body at all. Probably not. But I felt I existed.  		  		  			8774  			Natalie C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1natalie_c_nde.html  			Before my experience I was an ignorant child.

Its as though I could slow down and take everything in at the same time while the outside world was hurriedly panicking to assess everything. I was calm and outside world was in chaos.  		  		  			8871  			Alice U NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1alice_u_nde.html  			Well the light was so luminous so bright that here it would have blinded me yet there even though i had no eyes to speak of, the intense brightness was soothing and beautiful and i could feel communication was telepathic  		  		  			8876  			Bryan C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1bryan_c_nde.html  			Everything was more colorful and clearer.  		  		  			8887  			Ashley M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ashley_m_nde.html  			My vision was made clear from an all knowing love.

Like the colors were flowing liquid.  		  		  			9065  			Liam W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1liam_w_nde.html  			Normal  		  		  			9067  			Carolyn A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1carolyn_a_nde.html  			My vision was so much more brighter, clearer and more intenese.  		  		  			9068  			Lija A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lija_a_nde.html  			I could see by sensing. I could clearly see my human body, my mother and my house as well as the spirit beings  		  		  			9070  			Leonard M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1leonard_m_nde.html  			There is no comparison  		  		  			9074  			Steve H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1steve_h_nde_9074.html  			Normal  		  		  			9075  			William C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1william_c_nde_9075.html  			same  		  		  			9077  			Beth T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1beth_t_nde.html  			I didn’t have eyes because I didn’t Have a body form but I saw a very bright white area maybe some blues that was pretty much you know the colours I seen  		  		  			9089  			Kevin G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kevin_g_nde.html  			Same  		  		  			9090  			Thomas C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1thomas_c_nde_9090.html  			I could see even though I wasn't wearing glasses  		  		  			9091  			Nathan R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1nathan_r_nde.html  			Everything was almost completely black for most of the time. I wasn't blind, but I couldn't see much. I normally have no vision problems.  		  		  			9100  			Daniel R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1daniel_r_nde.html  			I couldn't see anything  		  		  			9104  			Grant F NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1grant_f_nde.html  			My vision was in the third person in a sense. I felt like a camera zooming away from my body towards the sky as everything moved so slow that it seemed frozen in time.  		  		  			9105  			Chris C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1chris_c_nde_9105.html  			The realm was formless. But i could say it was full of light and colour. If i imagine now being in a realm like that, it sounds scary: like losing one’s sight or going into a vortex. I’d want to reach out and touch familiar things, talk to familiar people, see the world i know. But in that realm I was aware of none of those things, and felt only peace and love.  		  		  			9108  			Anelia G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1anelia_g_nde.html  			I don't have memories before the experience as I was just a toddler.  		  		  			9111  			John W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1john_w_nde_9111.html  			I don't recall really seeing anything in particular other than the sense of being outdoors and in bright light.  		  		  			9115  			Annalise E NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1annalise_e_nde.html  			Q 6 and 7 the options are wrong for me. you are the thoughts. you have different senses. no sound. no sight. but so much more, more than everything we experience  		  		  			9116  			Ernest H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ernest_h_nde.html  			It was like watching myself on tv. An there was no pain or sound  		  		  			9117  			Lee S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lee_s_nde_9117.html  			my vision was crystal clear  		  		  			9119  			Anne W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1anne_w_nde.html  			In my near death there were dancing shadows, I didn't see any real people...Not sure why this is, but I heard from an IANDS leader that everyone experiences it differently...  		  		  			9121  			Viki NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1viki_nde.html  			Vivid, comforting,  		  		  			9125  			Rachael C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1rachael_c_nde.html  			My vision I work or need to wear glasses during this experience everything was so crystal clear  		  		  			9126  			Dr. Sahar S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1dr_sahar_s_nde.html  			i just saw a baeutiful green view...with rest and peace  		  		  			9132  			Janine S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1janine_s_nde.html  			Even though I could see my family, I actually felt them. Felt there confusion and panic. I didn’t feel sorry for them for their cause at that moment they were trying to save me but I felt pity for them because my existence was in know way what their existence was. And, they didn’t even know it.  		  		  			9137  			Makaila M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1makaila_m_nde.html  			I wear glasses with near sighted and astigmatism and for a full 5 minutes I could see clearly far away  		  		  			9139  			Star E NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1star_e_nde.html  			I can't. I wasn't in Heaven, so I did not see it. I was in the midst of the glory of God Himself.  		  		  			9151  			Sharon V NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sharon_v_nde.html  			This is an interesting question. My vision prior to the experience was what I'd call normal in that I'd open my eyes and my brain would process what I saw. During my experience I closed my eyes after the first shot, but I still could see very well. I had no trouble seeing myself leaning on the retaining wall, or the light that encircled me. My vision went from the outside to the inside.  		  		  			9152  			Ronald B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ronald_b_nde.html  			Your conscious thinking speeds up while in an NDE.  		  		  			9155  			Val C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1val_c_nde.html  			It wasn't that I had super hearing or vision, it was more like the telepathic communication was not a physical sound but also clearly not my own thoughts. The things I saw were not seen with physical eyes, so I was somehow able to perceive of all things at once and time didn't exist.  		  		  			9162  			Jennifer M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jennifer_m_nde.html  			Unable to compare  		  		  			9163  			Robert B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1robert_b_nde_9163.html  			hmmm....kinda the same  		  		  			9164  			Whitney H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1whitney_h_nde.html  			Clearer. But then not much to see. Seeing with eyes closed as opposed to watching my world  		  		  			9165  			Bill J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1bill_j_nde_9165.html  			could see more  		  		  			9174  			Natalia Th  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1_natalia_th_nde.html  			Immediately prior to entering the void i couldn't keep my eyes open, in the void it was like i could see clearly even though everything was just black and lacked light, but i knew where i was.  		  		  			9176  			Alex L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1_alex_l_nde.html  			I was like in a fog. As it seemed to clear I started to make out things but the light was all I seemed to care about. I couldn’t tell the the people apart they were shadows.  		  		  			9177  			John G NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1_john_g_nde.html  			It was CRYSTAL clear. I could vividly see my body laying there  		  		  			9179  			Kimberly T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1_kimberly_t_nde.html  			Everything was just really sharp and clear.  		  	                 </body>  </html>
