MEETING OF THE COUNCIL.
The 94th Meeting of the Council was held at 20 Hanover
Square, London, W., on Monday, December 14th, 1908 ; the
President, Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, in the chair. There were
also present Professor W. F. Barrett, Eev. A. T. Fryer, Sir
Lawrence J. Jones, Sir Oliver Lodge, Mr. J. G. Piddington,
Mr. St. G. L. Fox Pitt, Mr. S. C. Scott, Mr. H. Arthur Smith,
Lieut.-Colonel G. Le M. Taylor, Dr. C. Lloyd Tuckey, Mrs.
Verrall, Mr. V. J. Woolley, Miss Alice Johnson, Eesearch
Officer, and Mr. K. A. H. Bickford-Smith, Secretary.
The minutes of the last Meeting of the Council were read
and signed as correct.
Six new Members and seventeen new Associates were
elected. Their names and addresses are given above.
The monthly accounts for October and November, 1908,
were presented and read.
PEIVATE MEETING FOE MEMBEES AND ASSOCIATES.
The 25th Private Meeting for Members and Associates only was
held in the large Hall, at 20 Hanover Square, London, W., on
Monday, December 14th, 1908, at 4 p.m. ; the President, Mrs.
Henry Sidgwick, in the Chair.
The meeting was devoted to the discussion of " Cross-Corre-
spondences." The President, having explained that the papers
on the subject about to be read by Mr. Podmore, Mr. Dickinson,
and Mr. Constable were written independently of one another,
and that therefore for any completion of the discussion it would
be necessary to look to other speakers, called on Mr. Podmore to
read the first paper, which was as follows
By Frank Podmore.
For the benefit of those who are not thoroughly familiar with
the previous reports upon the subject, it will probably be
convenient if I briefly recapitulate the steps already taken in the
investigation of cross-correspondences.
The attempts so far made to decipher the contents of sealed
envelopes have failed. It is doubtful whether, even if successful,
they would have afforded convincing proof of the survival of
4 Joum-d of Society for Psychical Resectrch. Jan., 1909.
human personality. Nor can proof of the kind required be
found in references to past events in the lives of the supposed
communicators. We can never exclude the possibility that
knowledge of such past events may have been derived from
living minds. A similar objection applies to the simpler form
of cross-correspondences, the attempt to get a test word or phrase
reproduced by two or more different mediums. Broadly speaking,
the proof of human survival can be found only in intelligent
action on the part of discarnate spii'its in the present.
A study of the earlier scripts of Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Holland
and Mrs. Forbes suo"ested to Miss Johnson that traces of
such intelligent action, the action of an intelligence not that
of any of the automatists, could be found in certain cross-
correspondences occurring in these scripts. In Miss Johnson's
words :
" The characteristic of these cases is that we do not
get in the writing of one automatist anything like a verbal
reproduction of phrases in the others : we do not even get
the same idea expressed in different ways, as might well
result from direct telepathy between them. What we get is
a fragmentary utterance in one script, which seems to have
no particular point or meaning, and another fragmentary
utterance in the other, of an equally pointless character
but when we put the two together, we see that they supple-
ment one another and that there is apparently one coherent
idea underlying both, but only partially expressed in each."
Two examples of this kind of cross-correspondence may be
briefly recalled to memory. On August 28th, 1901, Mrs.
Forbes wrote a message purporting to come from her son
Talbot, to the effect that he was going to control a
sensitive who wrote automatically, in order that he might
obtain corroboration of Mrs. Forbes's writing. On the same
day Mrs. Verrall wrote in Latin :
" Sign with a seal. The
fir tree already planted in the garden gives its own portent."
The script was signed with a rough drawing of a sword, a
suspended bugle and two other figures. This script remained
without meaning for Mrs. Verrall until months later she
learnt that there were fir trees in Mrs. Forbes's garden specially
connected with her son, and that the badge of his regiment
was a suspended bixgle surmounted by a crown (Proc.
Vol. XX. p. 223). In another case, Mrs. Verrall, on
I
Jan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 5
March 2ncl, 4th, and 5th, 1906, wrote several messages,
chiefly in Latin, which showed no inteUigible connection to
her mind, but which suggested to Dr. Verrall liuphael's picture
of Attila before the gates of Eome. On March 7 th, two days
later, Mrs. Holland wrote, " Ave Eoma immortalis. How could
I m.ake it any clearer without giving her the clue ? " (Proc.
Part LV. p. 297).
That these enigmatic cross-correspondences were not elaborated
by the conscious intelligence of either automatist seems clear.
But Miss Johnson points out another significant circumstance.
Scattered through the script of the automatists, and generally
in close connection with cases of cross-correspondence, are many
phrases which, like that quoted from Mrs. Holland, " How could
1 make it any clearer without giving her the clue ?
" seem to
imply a deliberate design of composing enigmas, the answers
to which should be found only by " piecing together," or " weav-
ing together " tlie corresponding parts of scripts produced by
different hands. These frequent references, coupled with the
illustrations of the process actually found in the script, seemed
to justify Miss Johnson in suggesting " that one and the same
intelligence, or group of co-operating intelligences, was responsible
both for the cross-correspondences and for the contemporary
comments on them" {Proc. Part LV. p. 391).
Miss Johnson's theory, it will be remembered, was based on
the study of scripts by Mrs. Verrall and others, written before
the important series of experiments with Mrs. Piper which began
in November 1906. If we now endeavour to test the theory
by means of the scripts written during Mrs. Piper's stay in this
country, we find, in the first place, that with few exceptions the
successful cross-correspondences recounted in Mr. Piddington's
paper are clearly not of the complex type described by Miss
Johnson ; and in the second place that the intelligences of Mrs.
Piper's trance show nowhere any explicit knowledge of the
theory of cross-correspondences.
At the first sitting with Mrs. Piper, Sir Oliver Lodge
suggested to the Piper-Hodgson that a cross-correspondence
experiment should be made. The control agreed, and chose
the words St. Paul. The experim.ent was successful. The next
successful cross-correspondence consisted of the words Frwncis
and Ignatius : the third, of a geometrical figure —a triangle
6 Jdx.rnal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., i909.
inscribed in a circle—which was suggested by Mr. Piddiugton,
and successfully transferred to Mrs. Verrall. The fourth, the
word Stayplc, was apparently inspired by a recent dream of Mr.
Piddington's. These all are correspondences of the simplest
possible kind. From this point onwards, however, it will no
doubt have been observed that the correspondences are for the
most part of one uniform type. An idea occurs first in Mrs.
Verrall's script, and is repeated with several variations, as if for the
purpose of emphasis. A few hours, days, or weeks later, the same
idea, generally in the form of a single word, is given in Mrs. Piper's
script, or is spoken by her on coming out of the trance.
Thus, to quote an instance, at 11 a.m. on the 11th March,
1907, Mrs. Verrall wrote a passage harping on the word
violet, in which the following phrases occur :
" with violet
buds," " violacese," " violet and olive leaf, purple and hoary,"
" the city of the violet and olive crown." On the same day,
two hours later, Mrs. Piper in the waking stage ejaculated
Violets. Mrs. Piper's part of the cross-correspondence is
nearly always later than Mrs. Verrall's, and is always quite
simple and straightforward, consisting usually of a single word.
In Mrs. Verrall's script not only, as readers will have seen, is
the idea emphasised by repetition and variation, but in some cases
the actual word suggested by the script, which emerges subse-
quently in Mrs. Piper's trance, is not given—is indeed, it would
almost seem, deliberately suppressed. Thus, on 3rd April, 1907,
Mrs. Verrall wrote several phrases about wings, " and with
twain he covered his face," " the hosts of heaven," " his flame-
clad messengers," and finally draws a winged human figure.
Five days later, one of Mrs. Piper's controls announced :
" I
gave angel," meaning apparently "I gave anycl to Mrs. Verrall,
as the subject of a cross-correspondence." In another case Mrs.
Verrall's script is full of imagery and allusions conveying the
idea of death ; but the word death seems to be deliberately
avoided. Thus, the quotation :
" Come away, come away," breaks
off short before the significant word is reached.
Now these, and one or two other cases of the kind, unques-
tionably suggest design. It looks like an attempt at the kind
of cross-correspondence described by Miss Johnson. But if
there is design, it must be recognised that the design has
failed ; the allusions are not sufficiently enigmatic. In the
Jan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 7
last case, it will be remembered, Mrs. Verrall at once inter-
preted her script as alluding to Death.
Furthermore, it would appear from the last quoted instance
that some, at any rate, of the allusive references are not
due to an external intelligence : for two of the allusions to
Death are personal to Mrs. Verrall, and would be meaningless
to an outsider. There is one case, moreover, which is still
more significant in this connection. On Feb. 19th, 1907,
Mr. Piddington suggested Giant and Dwarf as the subject
of a cross-correspondence expei'iment with Mrs. Verrall. Mrs.
Piper's control accepted the suggestion, and said he would
go off at once to execute it. Later, the controls repeatedly
claimed to have been successful in transferring Dwarf. Mrs.
Verrall, who was not told of the date of the experiment,
twice searched the whole of her script written during that period.
On the first occasion, she failed to find any allusion to
Dwarf. On the second occasion, still in ignorance of the date,
she found in the script of the 19th Feb., written a few hours
only after the suggestion had been given to Mrs. Piper, an
allusion to Dwarf which had escaped her original scrutiny.
The allusion is contained in the words :
" A long featiier.
Ask about the feather,
Up the mountain—no, that is
Owl's feather ; not what I want."
" Up the mountain " and " owl's feather " suggested to Mrs.
Verrall, it will be remembered, a very familiar poem, dealing
with little men, wee folk, or, in other words, fairies. The
coincidence in time is here so close that it seems probable
that Mrs. Verrall's script is actually connected with the Dwarf
of the experiment ; and it would seem at first sight that we
have found here a cross-correspondence of the kind desired : an
allusion artfully concealed even from the automatist herself.
But if there were indeed design in this instance, it was not
the design of external intelligence. For what the Piper controls
repeatedly claimed to have impressed on Mrs. Verrall was not
the idea of Dwarf, but the actual letters of the word—D.W.Pi.F.
So that the imagery in the case was unquestionably supplied
by the mind of the automatist.
Few, then, of these later experiments have even a friria
8 Journal of Society for Psychical Researcli. Jan., 1 909.
facie claim tu be cross-correspondences of the complex kind
described by Miss Johnson. But the theory, it will be remem-
bered, was based not merely on a study of individual cases,
but on numerous allusions made by the controls.
If the theory is correct, we should expect to find that
the Piper controls—some of whom purport to be identical with
the intelligences controlling the other automatists referred to
would be well acquainted with the scheme of complex cross-
correspondences. It is, of course, on the theory, a scheme of
their own invention.
In connection with this subject let me call your attention
to the test message and its reception by the Piper controls : —
" We are aware of the scheme of cross-correspondences which
you are transmitting through various mediums, and we hope
that you will go on with them. Try also to give to A and
B two different messages, between which no connexion is dis-
cernible. Then as soon as possible give to C a third message
which will reveal the hidden connexion."
This message was translated into classical Latin, and repeatedly
dictated word by word at several successive seances to the
controls. The dictation began on the 17th December, 1906,
and was not completed until the 2nd January, 1907. The
Latin is so worded that a person ignorant of the language,,
or even a lower-form schoolboy armed with a dictionary,
would be unlikely to arrive at the meaning of the whole passage.
On Jan. 16th, a fortnight after the completion of the Latin
message, and before a translation was attempted, Mr. Piddington
tells us that he impressed on the Piper-Myers the import-
ance of cross-correspondent messages, and expressed the opinion
that it was " more important to get them than for you
spirits to give facts about your past lives." To that the
Piper-Myers replied by asking why so much importance was
attached to cross-correspondences : for, said he, " if you estab-
lish telepathic messages, you will doubtless attribute all such
to thoughts from those living in the mortal body" (p. 318).
This answer, as Mr. Piddington points out, shows intelligence.
But it is not, I submit, the intelligence that we should
expect on the hypothesis that this Piper-Myers is identical
with the Verrall-Myers. For the answer shows conclusively,
first, that the Piper-Myers had not grasped the plan of complex
/
Jan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 9
cross-correspondences, which the Verrall-Myers, according to the
hypothesis, had been actively elaborating for some years previ-
ously; and secondly, that the Piper-Myers, at that date, 16th Jan.,
1907, had not yet succeeded in translating the Latin message.
The Piper-Myers makes his first attempt to translate the Latin
message on the 20th Feb., more than a mouth later. " It is
with reference," he says, " to my being a messenger and my
handing through to you coherent . . . messages" (p. 330).
A few days later, on Feb. 27th, the Piper-Myers writes:
" I feel a little perturbed over your message to me when you
said I [failed] in replying sufficiently to convince you, etc.,
although I, as intermediary, had long since united my ideas."
Later in the same sitting he makes it clear that this passage
was intended for a translation of the Latin message: for he
now gives the translation as follows :
" Although you as intermediary have long since united mutually
ideas. You have or do not reply or respond sufficieutly to our
questions as to convince us of your existence" (pp. 332-3)
These replies show unmistakable knowledge of the meanin"
of some of the individual Latin words, and equally unmistak-
able ignorance of the meaning of the passage as a whole.
There is, it will be seen, no reference to cross-correspondences.
Later the trance intelligence seems to have connected the Latin
message with cross-correspondences, as indeed under the cir-
cumstances it or they could hardly fail to do. But it would
not appear that the true meaning, or an approximation to
the true meaning, was ever grasped. Thus, so late as the
27th May, 1907, the Piper-Myers gives as the translation
of the Latin message the following :
" You have long since
been trying to assimilate ideas, but I wish you to give through
Mrs. Verrall proof of the survival of bodily death in such a
way as to make it conclusive"; and then adds, "He mentioned
my own words in it, viz. the Survival of P>odily death," i.e.
words forming part of the title of Myers' last work (p. 394).
To sum up. It would appear from the reception of the
Latin message that the Piper controls, though they had somehow
acquired a knowledge of the meaning of individual words, are
unable to construe a Latin sentence, and are reduced to
guesswork. It appears, further, that they have not grasped
the scheme of complex cross-correspondences. Finally, the
a2
10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.
great majority of the individual cross-correspondences fail to
conform to the complex type. On the other hand, there
are clear traces of attempts to bring about such conformity
by involving the idea in enigmatic allusions ; and the source
of these enigmatic allusions can in some cases be clearly
traced to the mind of the automatist.
I do not claim that this summary criticism covers the
whole ground. There are some four or five cross-correspondences
which do not obviously fall into the category described. But
the details in these cases are extremely complicated, and the
interpretation is not merely difficult but ambiguous. Because
they are ambiguous the clue to the interpretation of these more
elaborate cases must, it seems clear, be sought in the first instance
in the analysis of the simpler instances of cross-correspondence.
We must proceed from the simple to the complex.

In discussing this subject the whole of the evidence contained
in Parts LIU., LV., LVII. of the Proceedings ought to be
brought under review. In the present paper limitations of
time have compelled me to confine myself to the evidence
presented in Mr. Piddington's paper (Part LVII.) and to
deal with that in a very summary manner. Four hypotheses
naturally present themselves as accounting severally or jointly
for the phenomena to be discussed: (1) Fraud, (2) Coincidence,
(3) Telepathy, ('4) a controlling intelligence or intelligences.
(1) Fraud I do not consider : partly because it is ruled
out by all who know Mrs. Piper and the other automatists
concerned ; but mainly because it could not explain the
cross-correspondences, unless it were joint-fraud, or conspiracy
a hypothesis which I believe in the present case, no one
would seriously put forward.
(2) Coincidence. The difficulty here is to determine the
probability of coincidence. Perhaps no more can be said than
that the probability increases (1) with the length of time
intervening between the dates of the corresponding scripts,
(2) with the commonness of the word or idea reproduced,
(3) with the lack of precision in the correspondence. For
example, taken by itself, such a correspondence as the word
Jan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 11
mountain given by Mrs. Piper on various occasions in March,
April, and May, with the phrase " the storied mount " in Mrs.
Verrall's script of April 6th (see pp. 230-7), would naturally
be explained by coincidence.
On the other hand, in the evidence before us, the corre-
spondences are sometimes precise, almost coincident in time,
and dealing with topics not very obvious. Thus on April
8 th at 7 a.m. Mrs. Holland in India writes
—"do you
remember that exquisite sky when the afterglow made the
east as beautiful and as richly coloured as the west" (p. 265).
On the same day between 11.30 a.m. and 1.10 p.m. Mrs.
Piper emerging from her trance gave the phrase " light in west
(p. 269). On the same day at 3.10 p.m. Mrs. Verrall wrote
" the words were from Maud but you did not understand.
Rosy is the east and so on" (p. 271);—a reference (with
substitution of the word east i'ov luest) to the well-known
lyric in MaAid. Here, even if these data be taken in
isolation, the explanation by coincidence seems improbable.
But to isolate the data is to distort the evidence. Eor Mr.
Piddington has been able to work out a connection between
a number of inter-related topics, of which the above is only
one, distributed among four different automatists. The chain
of connection is too complicated to be reproduced here. But
I presume it has been studied by most of those present ; and
I hardly think that any one who has studied it will hold
that coincidence is a plausible explanation of the phenomena.
(3) Telepathy, on the other hand, can put in a very serious
claim ; and if that hypothesis be indefinitely extended it might
be held to be a sufficient explanation of all the facts. Some
of the facts are explicable by direct telepathy from an agent
to a percipient present in the same room. In these cases
(1) the agent may consciously have in his mind a word or
idea, and desire to elicit it from the percipient. When, for
example, Mrs. Piper gave Plotinus, the author of the Greek
quotation auro? o'upavo<s aKVfxwv (p. 170) Mrs. Sidgwick, the
sitter, it must be presumed, had the name in her mind and
desired to get it. The same remark applies to the appearance
of the name Aht Vogler at another sitting where also Mrs.
Sidgwick was the sitter (p. 373). (2) The agent may not
consciously have in his mind the words or ideas elicited ; but
12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.
the telepathy may proceed from his sub-conscious self. Thus
telepathy is a possible explanation in the cases where Mrs.
Piper gives correspondences with passages in Mrs. Verrall's
script which the sitter has read, even though he may have
forgotten them. I may quote as an example the correspondence
of the words uttered by Mrs. Piper on emerging from her
trance on March 6th "moaning at the bar when I put out to
sea" (p. 150) with the words written by Mrs. Verrall on
Feb. 26th "and may there be no moaning at the bar" (p. 114).
—Mr. Piddington having read that script before his sitting
with Mrs. Piper on March 6 th.
(2) The agent and percipient may be separated by a
considerable distance ; and there may be no conscious attempt
to transmit nor any presence in the normal consciousness of
the ideas actually transmitted. This is clearly a great extension
of the hypothesis of telepathy ; but it is necessary if some of
the facts are to be explained by that hypothesis.
E.g. On Jan. 23rd Mrs. Verrall wrote " Eats star tars and
so on," and also '"'
KTATS rearrange these five letters or
ao-ain tears
stare "
(p. 61).
On Jan. 28th she wrote "Aster" (p. 62).
And on Feb. I7th Miss Verrall wrote
" a star above it all
rats everywhere in Hamelin town." And also the word arts
(p. 68).
If this is to be explained by telepathy, it is unintentional
telepathy from a distance and it is delayed. There is however
another correspondence in connection with this anagram which
is still more remarkable on the hypothesis of telepathy.
Among the late Mr. Hodgson's papers, at that time in
America, was one containing the same anagrams, viz., EATES,
STAEE, TEAES, TAEES, ASTEE and STAE, TAES, EATS,
AETS (p. 65). Mr. Piddington had seen, but forgotten a paper
of Mr. Hodgson's containing the latter of these anagrams ; he
does not believe that he had seen the former. If he had
not, the telepathy must be supposed to proceed from some
other person unknown who had seen Mr. Hodgson's papers.
If he had, the telepathy may be supposed to proceed from
him, but without any knowledge or intention on his part.
Jan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 13
In this case, on the hypothesis of telepathy, certain words
are transmitted unchanged, but in others, and the majority of
cases contained in this volume, and in the preceding ones
edited by Mrs. Verrall and Miss Johnson, instead of a direct
reproduction of simple words or ideas we have an interchange
of often remote and recondite allusions. Thus, to refer to
Mr. Piddington's most complicated case, there appear, in Mrs.
Holland's script of April 8th, the words " east and west,
Martha and Mary, Leah and Eachel," and " Paradiso " (p.
265). Leah and Eachel as types of the contemplative and
the active life, also commonly typified by east and west, are
the subject of a vision dreamt by Dante previous to his
passing through the fire and entering the Earthly Paradise.
In the cantos of the Purgatorio dealing with this episode occur
the words " GEEYON, CYTHEEEA, HELLESPONT" which
have occurred in the scripts of the other automatists and are
related by a complex series of associations which Mr. Piddington
has traced. If telepathy be the explanation here, we must
suppose a number of ideas to be unconsciously and uninten-
tionally transmitted by an automatist in England to an
automatist in India and to emerge there in the form of a
remote and recondite literary allusion. This, I should say,
is about the furthest possible extension of the hypothesis of
Telepathy. In my own opinion it is an extension beyond
what is probable, and the cases to which I have referred,
taken in connection with others, compel me to have recourse to
the fourth hypothesis of a directing intelligence or intelligences.
(4) This hypothesis does not exclude telepathy; but it supposes
that the telepathy is deliberately controlled by some intelligence
which is not the normal intelligence of any of the automatists.
The question remains what intelligence ? Broadly there are
two possibilities. The intelligence may be—what it purports
to be—that of a person or group of persons deceased ; or it
may be the sub-conscious intelligence of some living person or
persons—for example, of one of the automatists—dramatically
impersonating persons deceased. This latter hypothesis it would
be, so far as I can judge, impossible definitely to set aside. Not
only does demonstration in matters so new and strange appear to
be impossible, but common sense can hardly apply the ordinary
criteria of probability. Still there are certain considerations
14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.
that naturally suggest themselves. In favour of the hypothesis
that the controlling intelligence is what it purports to be, we
have: (1) The fact that this is suggested throughout by the
form of the script. This, of course, is not conclusive evidence.
The possibilities of dramatisation by the sub-conscious self
appear to be very extensive, and I don't know that we can
set a limit to them. At the same time I am myself, as I
read the evidence, very much impressed by the vraiscmblance
of the spiritistic hypotliesis ; and especially by the utterances
of Mrs. Piper when she emerges from trance. And I think
that this is a kind of evidence which must be taken into account.
(2) We know that the group of persons who purport to com-
municate were intensely interested in the question of the
survival of bodily death and were in a sense pledged, if they
survived, to endeavour to give us evidence of the fact (see
Proceedings, Part LV. p. 375). The kind of phenomena we
are now getting are, I think it may be claimed, such as
would be produced by intelligent people anxious to demonstrate
their existence and their agency but working in a very diffi-
cult element. Miss Johnson has worked out this point in her
paper on Mrs. Holland's script, and I need not elaborate it here.
On the other hand, the hypothesis that the persons professing
to communicate really do communicate is one which most
people find it difficult even provisionally to accept. This is
due partly to the confusion of the script. That, however,
is not x'eally a strong objection, for it is easy to suggest
reasons for the confusion, such for example as those put
forward by Dr. Hodgson in his paper on the Piper phenomena
{Proceedings, Vol. XIII. pp. 357-406). Partly the difficulty
is due to the failure of the supposed Controls to give inform-
ation for which they are asked. Why, for example, should
Myers, if Myers it were, be unable to give a simple reference
to Horace, Odes, i. 28, when elsewhere he has given quite
clearly references to the New Testament ? Why cannot he
translate accurately the simple phrase uvto? oupuvo? ukuixwv
instead of paraphrasing its meaning in the words Cloudless
Sky Horizon ? Why cannot he translate the Latin Message
instead of giving a very loose suggestion of some part of its
meaning ? I do not, however, myself lay much stress on
these points, because we know so little about the conditions
Jan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 15
of communicatioa with spirits, supposing such communication
to be possible. What really makes people hesitate to adopt,
even provisionally, the spiritistic hypothesis is a great
weight of prejudice against it. The grounds and justification
of this prejudice cannot be here discussed. I will only say
in conclusion that I regard it as unscientific and unphilosophical
and that I think the question ought to be approached with a
quite open mind, without any bias against the spiritistic view.

By F. C. Constable.
A CYNIC has said that human beings cannot reason : that
all they can do is to produce arguments in support of their
personal prejudices or, perhaps, what we may more courteously
term, their preconceived ideas. Out of respect, then, for the
preconceived ideas of those who may listen, I must state,
at the outset, two personal prejudices which govern the argu-
ments I shall adduce to-ni"ht.
The first is that I am foolish enough to think I do not
believe but know we have continued personal existence after
the dissolution of the body in a higher form than that of
human personality.
The second is involved in the first : the survival of human
personality after death is, to me, impossible. There are very
many, of whom I am one, who believe that human personality
is no more than a passing manifestation in our time and
space of some real personality, and that it is this person-
ality which survives the dissolution of the body, the brain
and human ideas. Myers himself said, " If an immortal
soul there be within us, she must be able to dispense with
part of the brain's help while the brain is living, as with the
whole of its help when it is dead." {Proceedings S.P.E., Vol.
IV. p. 260.)
What do we mean by human personality ?
If we consider any number of children at the moment
of birth, we do not speak of their human personalities : their
human personalities are potential only. What they may be
at manhood depends largely on environments of wealth or
poverty, social status and personal opportunity. Xo one, for
instance, would deny that the human personality of a Myers
16 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.
or Gurney was in great part the result of personal environ-
ments of comparative wealth, social status and opportunity.
No one, on the other hand, would deny that many a child
who has grown up into a man, absorbed through life in the
mindless labour of the plough, might, if born under a luckier
star, have evolved into a human personality marked by full
intellectual development.
Human personalities, then, appear to many of us to be
in great measure subjects of the environments of our universe
in time and space : each human personality appears to be
distinct from all others only because of the particular evolved
formation of the material brain of the particular individual.
So we cannot believe in the survival of human personality
after the dissolution of the material brain.
Many of us, also, find in the fact that only the very few
have opportunity of evolving into the higher forms of human
personality, that which, on its face, marks an inherent injustice
in the scheme of nature. If, however, we make the intellectual
in humanity subjective to what—for want of better words in
definition—we may term " will and idea," then, possibly, we
destroy the reality of this inherent injustice. I submit that
Schopenhauer's expansion of Kant's reasoning in the Critiqtte
does not involve us in pessimism. It points rather to Death
as the Supreme arbitrator between good and evil, those principles
of contradiction which are always at strife in our phenomenal
universe.
Death is the one touch of nature which makes the whole
world kin. Death, by dissolving our bodies and our brains,
frees us from bondage to earth and earthly ideas and sets
us on a wider, spiritual path, where brotherly love and universal
sympathy are free and unfettered. Eansomed by Death, we
at last find our own full self-consciousness. And we find it
not in ourselves but in others.
" To see the world in a grain of sand
And a heaven in a wild flower;
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand
And eternity in an hour."
Weighted by these prejudices I turn to the question of cross-
correspondence.
We have reports before us, all admirable, from Mrs. Verrall,
Jan., 1909. Private Meeting for 31emhers mid Associates. 17
Miss Johnson, and Mr. Piddington. But as that of Mr.
Piddington makes most strongly for the theory that human
personality survives, and as I am limited in time, I confine
myself to a consideration of Mr. Piddington's paper. It must
be remembered, however, that we have not Mrs. Piper's full
script before us : it is given to us only in isolated passages.
And these passages are isolated solely for the purpose of
illustration and support to Mr. Piddington's strenuous and
valuable labour in arriving at explicit cross-correspondences.
The full script would be required before it could be used
as evidence in support of the fact of our communion with the
disembodied as personalities higher in form than human per-
sonalities. But, even as offered to us, I doubt that it supports
any theory of the survival of human personality, tlrough it
may possibly favour some theory of the survival of higher forms
of personality.
If human personalities survive, then they are
things of cognition lilvc to ourselves. They think in succession
just as we think, they have ideas in succession as we have ideas.
And they have memory i7i succession like to ourselves.
If, then, these human personalities survive we are justified
in assuming there can be, w"hat is ordinarily termed, direct
transference of ideas between them and us.
But, if this be so, why is it we never find from them
a direct answer ear-marked to a direct question ? iS^ever
a simple and direct correspondence ear-marked between the
script of two automatic writers ? Between the living we
do get this (apparent) direct transference of ideas—note, for
example. Miss Eamsden's experiment of the white pig with a
long snout—but I cannot find it between the living and the
disembodied.
Let us assume that Myers, for instance, survives as a human
personality and judge the recorded facts by the light of that
assumption.
Now Myers in these experiments is treated at the outset
(with Mrs. Piper) as a human personality who can deal with
words as distinct from feeling or emotion. And he assumes
to deal with icorcls. For instance (p. 236) he gives to Mrs.
Piper twelve words,—lakes, rivers, etc.,—which he says he has
made or will make Mrs. Verrall write. That is, he can think
18 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.
these 12 words, he can tell Mrs. Piper the 12 words he has
thought of, he can tell her he intends to give or has given
them in writing to Mrs. Verrall.
Then, when he gives some of these words to Mrs. Verrall
why can he not ear-mark the words he has given as those
he wanted to give ? He does not do so in any case : at
times, he even leaves Mrs. Verrall in sheer ignorance of what
he has done and depends on the extraordinary ingenuity of
Mr. Piddington to pick out, from a number of others, the
words intended to be transferred, or to arrive at the fact that
cross-correspondence exists by recondite analogy.
Why can he not do with Mrs. Verrall what he has done
with Mrs. Piper ? And, surely, if he gave the same word
explicitly to Mrs. Verrall that he gave to Mrs. Piper, the
evidence of his personal interference would be in form far
stronger than it, in fact, is (p. 319).
It is no reply to say " the difficulty lies in the transfer."
If Myers can give a word so definitely to one, there is no
reason why he should not if a human personality—give it
as definitely to another. There is not, I think, one case of a
clear answer ear-marked to a clear question : not one case, for
instance, where Myers makes Mrs. Piper write, " I shall transfer
the word crystal to Mrs. Verrall
;
" and makes Mrs. Verrall
write, " Crystal. Tliis word I have transferred to you from
Mrs. Piper."
Again, in the avro^ ovpavo^ aKvfxcov case, Myers ab first
very definitely and persistingly gives Homer's Illiard {sic)
(p. 166) as the reply to the request for the author's name.
Who made the mistake ? Myers ? Ultimately Myers gives the
correct reply " Plotinus." And he expresses great pleasure at
his success. But how did he know of the success ? Because
he was told he had succeeded. If he had been told Homer's
Illiard was the correct answer, 1 think we must assume he
would have expressed the same pleasure in assumed success.
I cannot find evidence that he knew Plotinus was the right
and Homer's " Illiard " the wrong reply : as a human personality
he appears not to be objective but fully subjective—his very
personal belief appears to depend on what human beings tell him.
But this question of Myers's human personality being sub-
jective to Mrs. Piper or others, as the case may be, has been
Jax., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 19
considered by other speakers. So I shall now only refer to
Mrs. Verrall's script.
What is it that has obliged Mr. Piddington to enter on
heavy labour which has involved long time , and strenuous
intellectual expenditure in the unearthing of these correspond-
ences ? It is not that he finds any difficulty with Mrs. Piper
for, with her, the words, the subjects of experiment, are given
explicitly. His difficulty is with Mrs. Verrall. And that
arises from the fact that the words are given to her, not
explicitly, but implicitly.
Now consider Mrs. Verrall's script. It consists of (1) passages
from authors known to her, more or less correctly recorded,
(2) apparently original imaginative productions for which she
must have used memory, (3) broken, scrappy sentences which,
however, generally relate to what is in her memory or result
from the play of her imagination with what is in her memory.
In this script Mr. Piddington sometimes finds the word
wanted. But, I think, whether or not he finds the word wanted,
the script itself in most of the cases turns on some general
underlying idea in which the word wanted is involved.
For instance, consider the script on the bottom of page 196.
The word Mr. Piddington wants is " Diana." The word Diana
is itself given, but the script turns on a general idea relating
to Diana.
(In the " thanatos " case (p. 302) Mr. Piddington says that if
the subject of Death was inspired in Mrs. Verrall from the outside,
we must conclude that the form was, in part at least, deter-
mined by the automatist's own mind. I agree, but say the form
was altogether determined by Mrs. Verrall's understanding.)
Now all that appears in Mrs. Verrall's script was in her
potential memory before she wrote it, except where the script
shows also the play of her imagination with her memory. There-
fore Myers did not originate the script. All he can have done
is to have so affected Mrs. Verrall that she recalled in present
memory the particular passages, or that she exercised her own
imagination in a particular way. Mrs. Verrall exercised
throughout her oum understanding (Cousin's reminiscence)
Myers's influence (if any) was in affect 07i her understanding.
Bear in mind there is no magic in the writing itself : that
resulted merely from Mrs. A-^errall's exercise of an acquired
20 Journal of Society for Psycldcal Research. Jan., 1909.
art ; even Mrs. Piper could not have written or spoken as she
has if she had not acquired the art of writing or speaking.
I have argued against the view that the evidence before
us suggests communication from the disembodied as human
personalities. But the evidence of implicit, not explicit corre-
spondence, remains to be accounted for.
If the disembodied exist in a state and universe free from oxtr
limitations of time and space we can still well imagine that
they may have power to project themselves—for communication
with us—on to our limited universe, and speak and appear to
us as human personalities. And, too, I think, we can well
imagine their finer and fuller minds can use our minds for
communication with us. The disembodied cannot use their
own great organs of mind, with infinite continuum of sound, to
give us music. They must play on the lilliputian human
organs, with their finite limits of discrete tones, to make music
comprehensible to us : they can communicate with us implicitly,
not explicitly.
I find, though but dimly, evidence in the cases we consider
of directive influence from the disembodied.
A discussion followed these papers.
Mi;. J. G. Piddington said : I shall try to make my
observations on the three papers to which we have just
listened as concise as possible. I shall deal with the papers
in the order in which they were read.
Mr. Podmore says that with the exception of " St. Paul,"
" Francis and Ignatius," " Triangle within a circle " and
" Steeple, '
the cross-correspondences " are of one uniform
type. An idea occurs first in Mrs. Verrall's script. . . .
Later the same idea is given in Mrs. Piper's script." It is
true that Mr. Podmore subsequently qualifies this statement
and admits that the order of emergence does occasionally
vary. He does not, however, emphasise the exceptions
whereas I wish to, as I consider them to be too important
to be slurred over. Thus the cross-correspondences entitled
in my paper " Cup " and " Thanatos " occurred first in Mrs.
Piper's trance- script or speech, next in Mrs. Holland's script,
and last in Mrs. Verrall's. The " Wordsworth Country
topic emerged first in Mrs. Piper's script, and afterwards in
Mrs. Verrall's, What I take to be the allusions to the
Jan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 21
identification of East and West emerged first in Mrs. Holland's
script, next in Mrs. Piper's waking-stage, and last in Mrs.
Verrall's script. Moreover, none of the three names—Leopold,
Harold, Silvia—which served to reveal a hidden connexion
between a variety of apparently disconnected topics contained
in all three scripts—appeared in Mrs. Verrall's script at all.
If, then, Mrs. Verrall's subconsciousness was the originator
and telepathic transmitter of the concordant ideas distributed
amoncf the various autoniatists, and of the clues to their
interconnexion, one must infer that in some cases it did not
allow some of the ideas to emerge in lier own script until
they had first emerged elsewhere, and that in other cases
it did not allow ideas which it had communicated to the
other autoniatists to be expressed in her own script at all.
In Mr. Podmore's opinion the form of the allusions to
the same subject in the different scripts is not sufBciently
enigmatic to indicate the intervention of a mind external
to the automatists. As regards a good many of the cases
I am disposed to agree with this view ; but I find the
requisite '
enigmaticalness ' (if I may coin the word) in the
connexion of thought which links together many of the
subjects of the cross-correspondences. Of this connexion of
thought not one of the automatists had the vaguest inkling.
I agree with Mr. Podmore that there was nothing written
or spoken by the Piper, controls (unless it were, perhaps,
the words " United we stand, divided we fall ") to show that
they understood the second sentence of the Latin message.
But the fact that cross-correspondences of a complex type
began to make their appearance only after the second sentence of
the message had been dictated to the controls, suggests—though
it certainly cannot be said to do more than suggest—that they
may have comprehended the second sentence, although they made
no attempt to translate it. The trance-personalities, be it noted,
were never requested to translate the Latin Message. What they
were asked to do was to send an intelligent reply to it.
The only other remark that I have to offer on Mr.
Podmore's paper is that I regret that his analysis of the
cross-correspondences stopped short just at the point where
their complexity becomes difficult to account for by mere
telepathic interchange between the automatists.
Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.
To turn now to the second paper. " Some of the facts,"
says Mr. Lowes Dickinson, " are explicable by direct telepathy
from an agent to a percipient present in the same room."
This is so ; but I would have you observe that in no .single
case of cross-correspondence need the sitter have been the
agent ; in several cases he could not have been ; and in
every case one of the automatists may have been. And
that last statement holds good even in the " Steeple " cross-
correspondence, where I seem to have a facie claim to
be regarded as the source of Mrs. Piper's knowledge ; for it
was not until Mrs. Verrall had learnt from me about the
cross-correspondence which I wrongly imagined had occurred
between her and Mrs. Holland that the word " Steeple
appeared in Mrs. Piper's script. And in this connexion
part of the context in which " Steeple " was there given is
of interest :
" I thought," wrote MyerSp, " you \i.c. J.G.P.]
gave it at Mrs. Verrall's."
Mr. Dickinson cites the quotations from Crossing the Bar
given by Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Piper as a possible example
of thought-transference from the subconsciousness of the sitter.
But I do not think it a well-chosen instance for these reasons
When the quotation from Crossinr/ the Bar was given in
Mrs. Piper's trance it was closely followed by the utterance
of the name " Arthur Hallam." Now I, the sitter, had read
the script of Mrs. Verrall's which contained the concordant
quotation from Grossing the Ba.r ; but I had not read a
script of hers of later date which contained a quotation
from In Mcmoriam. This script had in fact been written
only two hours before Mrs. Piper uttered " Arthur Hallam,"
and had then not been read by any one except Mrs. Verrall.
Hence arises a strong presumption that, if any living person
was the agent, it was, not I, the sitter, who had seen only
Mrs. Verrall's Crossing the Bar script, but Mrs. Verrall who
knew the contents both of the Crossing the Bar and of the
III Memoriam scripts. The cross-correspondences " Laurel
Wreath " and " Library, my own name and Mrs. Sidgwick's
would be better examples of possible thought-transference
from the sitter's subconsciousness than the quotation from
Crossing the Bar.
Incidentally in the course of his paper, Mr. Dickinson
Jan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 23
asks :
" Why . . . should Myers, if Myers it were, be unable
to give a simple reference to Horace, Odes, I. 28, when
elsewhere he has given quite clearly references to the New
Testament ? Even if we make the very big assumption
that because Myers can cast a message delivered to one
automatist in a certain form he can therefore cast a message
delivered to another automatist in the same form, and that
accordingly Myers, had he chosen, could have communicated
the reference "Horace, Odes, I. 28" through Mrs. Piper,
there may have been a very good reason why Myers did
not answer Mrs. Verrall's question about an Ode of Horace
in so simple a manner. Mrs. A^errall knew that the answer
to her question ought to be "Horace, Odes, I. 28;" and if
the answer had been given in that form, Mrs. Verrall would
at once have been pounced upon as being the guilty telepathic
agent : and no one would have realized this better than Myers,
" if Myers it were." The roundabout and involved manner
in which, as I think, MyerSp did answer the question, cannot
certainly be ascribed to any obvious and easy form of telepathic
interchange between Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Verrall.
I will now discuss some points in the third and last
paper. Mr. Constable asks :
" Why is it we never find . . .
a simple and direct correspondence ear-marked between the
script of two automatic writers?" I should answer that question
by denying the assumption on which it is based. We do
find simple and direct correspondence between two automatists,
and, as I shall show presently, " ear-marked " too. " Triangle
within a circle," " Laurel Wreath," " Shadow," and the quotations
from Crossing the Bar are instances of simple and direct
correspondence.
Then Mr. Constable goes on to say :
" When he [i.e. Myers]
gives some of these words [i.e. words chosen as the subjects
of cross-correspondence experiments] to Mrs. Verrall, why can
he not ear-mark the words he has given as those he wanted
to give ? He does not do so in any case : at times he even
leaves Mrs. Vei-rall in sheer ignorance of what he has done,
and depends on the ingenuity of Mr. Piddington to pick out
from a number of others the words intended to be transferred."
Although in some cases a phrase, word or idea in Mrs.
Verrall's script, which is reproduced by Mrs. Piper, was not
24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909
accompanied by any indication of its being the subject of
a cross-correspondence experiment, in eleven cases at least a
sufficiently clear indication was given, as will be seen from
the following list, in which I give, first, the title of the
cross-correspondence, and, second, the phrase in Mrs. Verrall's
script which indicates that a counterpart is to be looked for
in another script.
(1) "Library, my own name and Mrs. Sidgwick's."
" I will give the message elsewhere too today . . .
wait for their answer."
(2) "Laurel Wreath."
" iSIo more today—await the better news that brings
assurance with a laurel crown."
(3) "Arrow."
Drawing of three arrows followed by the words " tria
convergentia in unum."
(4) Crossing the Bar.
" I think I have got some words from the poem written
down—if not stars and satellites, another phrase will
do as well. And may there be no moaning at the
bar—my Pilot face to face."
(5) Hercules Ftirens of Euripides.
"Ask elsewhere for the BOUND HERCULES."
(G) "Angel."
Drawing of an angel followed by the words " F.W.H.M.
has sent the message through—at last I
(7) "Azure" and "Horizon."
" We will try to give the message to them. It has
come first to you."
(S) "Shadow."
" Let Piddington know when you get a message about
shadow."
(9) "Laus Deo."
" Laus in aeternum Aeterno Deo " followed by allusions
in Greek to the combination of like parts.
(10) "Fairy."
" Faery lands forlorn " followed by the words " I will
try to get the idea elsewhere conveyed—but it is hard
and I know I have failed before."
Jan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 25
(11) "Light in West."
" You will find that you have written a message for
Mr. Picklington which you did not understand but he
did. Tell him that."
Moreover, emphasis was in several instances thrown on the
important word by means of repetition or by the use of capital
or laro-e letters.
Mr. Constable, then, is not justified in saying that the
words to be transferred were not ear-marked in any case.
And although he is justified in saying that " at tirnes Myers
leaves Mrs. Verrall in ignorance of what he has done," still
the equally important fact must not be lost sight of, that in
many instances Mrs. Verrall's script contained quite sufficiently
explicit indications of what the words to be transferred" were.
Mr. Constable is of opinion that " if he [Myers] gave the
same word explicitly to Mrs. Verrall that he gave to Mrs.
Piper, the evidence of his personal interference would be in
form far stronger than it, in fact, is." I disagree in toto ;
and I would on the contrary maintain that if the cross-corre-
spondences had throughout consisted of exact verbal coincidences,
the evidence for direct telepathy between the two automatists
would be far stronger. It is the obliquity of the coincidences
that suggests the intervention of some third mind.
Sir Oliver Lodge said that he welcomed the frank discussion
of the subject of cross-correspondences from various points of
view, since he regarded the subject as one eminently worthy
of discussion and likely to be treated as of considerable
importance in the future. The discussion could only be fully
followed by those who had made some study of the recent
Procecdhigs ; and he could assure the members of the Society
that they were well worth study.
He thought that Mr. Constable's paper rather led away
from the immediate subject by introducing a C[uestion as to
location of personality, whether it lodged in the human beings
or automatists concerned, or whether it belonged in any degree
to the ostensible communicators. This question at the present
stage did not seem to him important ; the real point for
discussion was whether the phenomenon as observed could
be explained by telepathy from living people or by an elabora-
tion and dramatic simulation by the unconscious or subliminal
26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.
self of the automatist. It was to fulfil tlie function of deciding
between these three hypotheses that cross-correspondences were
designed, and for this purpose the more complex and ingenious
they were the better.
He therefore opposed Mr. Constable's plea for greater
simplicity and directness, and favoured Mr. Podmore's plea
for greater subtlety and obscurity. A direct and simple
cross-correspondence, say for instance such a sentence as
" A pig with a white-nosed snout," appearing in two places
at once, would support the argument for ordinary telepathy,
such as operated in the case of Miss Miles and Miss Kamsden
for instance. In order to make an effective cross-correspondence
such as would justify as a working hypothesis the postulation
of the activity of the intelligence, say of F. W. H. Myers, what
was required was something so ingeniously wrapped up that it
would convey no impression to either automatist alone ; but
when put together by a third person,—or, still better, by the help
of another communication through a third automatist, and then
criticised by a fourth person,—would result in full and lucid
meaning, and if possible a meaning which should involve wide
literary knowledge and recondite classical allusions.
Such cross-correspondences he thought we had now got ; and
the ingenuity and subtlety and literary allusiveness made the
record difficult to read, even when disentangled and presented
by the skill of Mr. Piddington.
He was quite sure that the correspondences were not invented
by Mr. Piddington, but were detected by him as already existing
in the script.
The only fault he found with Mr. Podmore's paper was that
he concentrated attention on the simpler and less important
correspondences, and seemed to ignore those which more clearly
satisfied the conditions desired, saying that these must be
interpreted in terms of the simpler. From that conclusion
Sir Oliver Lodge dissented, holding that the phenomenon
presented to our observation must be studied in its complexity
and entirety ;
since, as was now clear, complexity was of the
essence of the matter.
Mr. St. G. Lane Fox Pitt held that the result of these
experiments had been so far the clear demonstration of the
fact that there were vehicles through which conscious intellectual
Jan,, 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 27
life could function other than the physical brain. That in
itself was an achievement of undoubted scientific importance.
The next step was to discover the laws by which the
observed phenomena were governed. He deprecated the use
of such expressions as " external intelligences," " Spirit identity,"
and " Spirit hypothesis " as being devoid of any real meaning.
He suggested that much light could be thrown on the subject
of the manifested intelligences by the consideration of psychical
phenomena within the experience of all, namely dream per-
sonalities. These often seemed quite real to our sleeping
consciousness. They seemed to be endowed with reasoning-
powers, with knowledge, which was sometimes beyond that of
our waking capacity, and very often with an appearance of
independence and egoistic self assertion which was quite
surprising. Mr. Fox Pitt said he believed that our subliminal
minds, not being limited and conditioned in the same way as
the normal supraliminal mind, were capable of assimilating
ideas and thoughts from other subliminals, and possibly also
from what might be called the surviving psychic reliquite of
deceased personalities. Subliminals seemed at times to be
able to coalesce with one another so as to generate in a psychic
vehicle what had all the appearance of distinct and separate
personalities, capable of manifesting themselves through and
even of " controlling " a living organism. Such " entities " might
possibly account for the alleged materialisation phenomena.
The Hox. Johx Harfjs suggested that the hieroglyphic signs
in the script printed on p. 68 of Proceedings, Vol. XXII.,
could be interpreted as a combination of illiterate Arabic and
Hindostani, and that the meaning would then be :
" Shut up
it is not in our agreement ; that is the end of it."
Mrs. Veerall replied : With regard to Mr. Harris's point,
I have heard it suggested that the script in question is
Persian, and that it is shorthand, and I have received two
interpretations—neither complete—of its meaning in shorthand.
But, for the present, it seems safer to suppose that it is
mere scribble.
Mr. Podmore drew attention to the number of cases of
cross-correspondences between Mrs. Piper and myself, in which
the first emergence was in my script, and both he and Mr.
Constable commented on the comparative simplicity of the
28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.
expressions used in Mrs. Piper's trance compared with the
elaborate allusiveness found in my automatic writing.
The statistics as to priority of emergence are as follows
The 24 ^ cases in which Mrs. Piper was concerned consist of
16 double eases {i.e. involving one other automatist) and 8 triple
cases (that is, involving two other automatists). In the 16
double cases, Mrs. Piper was first 4 times, Mrs. Holland
once, viz. in the only case in which she took part, and 111
times out of the 14 in which I took part. In the 8 triple
cases Mrs. Piper was first in 2 (thus keeping the same ratio
to her total), Mrs. Holland was first in 2 out of 5, and I
in 4 out of 8. It is thus noticeably true —not so much that
I was first, for Mrs. Holland's priority in the triple cases is
almost as marked—but that Mrs. Piper was second.
The reason for this is prol)ably due to the same cause that
accounts for the brevity and directness of her sayings. There is
a great difference in the circumstances of Mrs. Piper's script on
the one hand and Mrs. Holland's and mine on the other. Mrs.
Piper is in trance, and therefore (1) unconscious of what she
produces, (2) kept to the point by questions from the sitter
in charge. The complete consciousness on my part of each
word as it emerges—though never of the general sense
probably checks distinctive phrases and tends to produce
vagueness, and in the absence of questions from a bystander,
repetition is an obvious means of bringing out the points by
emphasis. Under these circumstances it is clearly easier to
produce a plain statement through Mrs. Piper ; and since it is
safer not to prophesy until you know, the plain statement
tends to take the form " Such a one has written," rather than
" will write," so and so.
It is true, as Mr. Podmore has said, that the majority of
the cross-correspondences are not of the complex type desired,
and demanded in the " Latin Message." But several of them
are more than mere repetitions, in varying form, of the same
idea. Of two in particular T should like to speak, "Thanatos"
(No. XXI.) and " Abt Vogler " (Nos. III. and VL).
On April 16th Mrs. Holland's script contained,—after two
words of similar sound, " Maurice," " Morris,"—the Latin word
1 Omitting Nos. IV., XV., and counting two cross-correspondences each in
Nos. XI., XII., and XVII. of Mr. Piddington's Report.
Jan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 29
for Death, " Mors," followed by a phrase referring to the idea
of Death. On April l7th, in the waking-stage, Mrs. Piper
uttered the sounds, " Sanatos, Tanatos," and on April 23rd,
" Thanatos," the Greek word for Death. On April 29th my
script consisted of four literary quotations, all involving the
notion of Death, the last of them being the famous passage
in Horace {Od. L, 4), whose rhythm and alliteration imitate
the sudden interruption of the dance of the Graces, " imminente
luna," by the sound of the approaching footsteps in the Dance
of Death :
" Pallida mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas
Eegumque turres."
It cannot be accident which combines in each case a sug-
gestion of sound with the idea of Death, and makes use of
the three different languages through the three automatists.
In the case of " Abt Vogler " we have a cross-correspondence
of the complex type desired. The dates here are important.
On January 2nd the delivery of the " Latin Message " was
complete. On January 16th Mr. Piddington spoke to the
Piper controls of the importance of cross-correspondences, and
suggested the drawing of a triangle within a circle to show
that a script formed part of a cross-correspondence. On
January 23rd and 28th my script contained allusions to Hope,
Star and Browning's Abt Vogler, and on February 3rd and l7th
Miss Verrall's script alluded to star and Browning. On Feb-
ruary 11th, before the completion of Miss Verrall's allusion,
but after its beginning, the Piper controls announced as a
cross- correspondence " Browning, Hope, and Star," and on
March 6th and thenceforward persistently they claimed that
this particular cross-correspondence was " an answer to the
Latin Message
;
" in other words, a cross-correspondence of the
complex type.
Is this claim justified ? Is something discoverable b}' putting
the statements together that is not discoverable from any single
one of them ? I think this is so. Mrs. Piper describes the
cross-correspondence as " Browning Hope and Star." ffajM
appears in my script as a mis-quotation in a line of Abt Vogler,
but does not appear in the poem at all. Brovming and Star
appear in both my script and my daughter's. The emphasis
in my script among Browning's poems is plainly on Abt Voglrr,
but there is no indication in my script as to which, if either.
30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.
of the lines in that poem which refer to a star nnderlies the
general thought.^ The lines are
Stanza IV. "
•
"Not a point nor peak bnt found and fixed its wandering star."
Stanza VII.
"That out of three sounds he frame not a fourth sound but a star,"
But given that one of these two lines is to be indicated, Miss
Verrall's script settles the point beyond dispute. The star is
"the sign;" there is "heavenly harmony," "the diapason," "the
mystic three," "above it all is the star." Thus while my script
determines the poem, my daughter's script determines the line.
But her script alone does not determine the poem. It is only
by combining her script with mine, and by interpreting them
on the lines suggested by the three words of the Piper controls,
that we see the point of this complex cross-correspondence, and
find that the whole is something more than the sum of the
parts.
Moreover, to this, the first cross-correspondence since January
16th, is appended the distinguishing sign suggested by Mr.
Piddington, a triangle within a circle, ingeniously connected
with Browning's poem of Aht Vogler. Thus, though the first
emergence of the allusion is in my script, the whole experiment
must be dated from the suggestion of the geometrical figure to
the Piper controls on January 16th, and therefore the cross-
correspondence does not originate with me.
It is true that the Piper controls did not succeed in trans-
lating the " Latin Message," but they did better ;
they acted
upon it. In immediate response, and by the method desired,
came an unmistakable allusion to the line in Alt Vogler
" That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star."
It is manifest that the verse thus indicated is singularly
appropriate as the subject of a cross-correspondence of the
particular type desired, so that the choice of topic no less than
the method of conveyance points to an intelligent response to
the request of the experimenters, and justifies the claim of the
Piper controls that tliis particular cross-correspondence was
intended as an " answer to your Latin message."

OBITUAEY.
Professor Jules Liegeois.
Members of the S.P.R. will have heard with profound regret
of the tragic death of Professor Liegeois of Nancy. While
spending his holiday last autumn in the Vosges he was run
over and killed by a motor car before the eyes of his wife,
with whom he was walking on a quiet country road.
Dr. Liegeois was Professor of Jurisprudence in the University
of Nancy, and a distinguished lawyer. He was one of the trio
of eminent men occupying chairs in that university—Liegeois,
Bernheim, and Beaunis—who followed the teaching of Liebeault
and did so much to place the study and practice of hypnotism
on a sound and scientific basis. In his first monograph on the
subject, Za Suggestion ct le Somnambulismc dans leurs rajyports avcc
la Jurisjmcdcnee et la MMecinc Ugale, a work which had a great
sale and aroused much interest when it appeared in 1889,—he
tells how, in 1878, his attention was first drawn to the question
of hypnotism, and he was shortly afterwards introduced to Lie-
beault, at that time ignored by the Faculties. He soon realised
the importance of suggestion from a legal as well as a medical
point of view, and his experiments on Liebeault's somnambules are
among the best reported. Professor Beaunis said of him that of
all the authors who have investigated hypnotic phenomena none
has drawn a picture of such extraordinary clearness and exactitude.
Liegeois took a prominent part in the famous trial of Gabrielle
Bompard in 1889. This young woman was charged with
murder under sensational circumstances, and Liegeois contended
that she had acted under hypnotic suggestion. He urged that
she should be hypnotised and made in the hypnotic state to
react the crime and divulge the name of the hypnotiser.
He argued the case with much eloquence, and at great length,
before the Paris tribunal, but he was not allowed to put his
theories to the test, and the prisoner was found guilty and
sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. This case illustrates
the views Liegeois took up and strenuously held to the end,^
that under hypnosis a certain proportion of somnambules are
so dominated by suggestion that they become mere automata
1 These views are set forth at length in his book UHypnotismt et hs Suggestions
Criminellen, 1898.
32 Journal of Society for Psyclvical ResearcJi. Jan., 1909.
to execute the commands of the hypnotiser ; and that the
existence of this power for evil should be recognised and
guarded against. As a safeguard he advised that very hypno-
tisable subjects should be protected from abuse of suggestion
by being told that they must never be hypnotised except with
their written consent and in the presence of a member of
their family,—advice which is found to be efficacious and
which is largely acted upon. Dr. Liegeois was a corresponding
member of the S.P.E., and was personally known to many of

kindly hospitality. He was always ready to help inquirers by
his experience and advice ; and he will be missed by a large
circle of friends in all parts of the world.
In addition to the books already referred to, Liegeois con-
tributed papers on the same subject to various scientific
societies and international congresses, and at the time of his
death was preparing for publication a large and important
work elaborating his theories of the condition lyrimc ct scconde.

PSYCHICAL EESEAPtCH IN CURRENT PERIODICALS.
We should like to draw the special attention of our readers
to an article by our late President, the Right Hon. G. W.
Balfour, in the IIibI)ert Journcd for January 1909, entitled
" Sonie recent investigations by the Society for Psychical
Research." This deals with the question of cross-correspondences,
giving a summary, which will be very useful to students of the
subject, of some of the most complicated cases in Mr. Piddington's
report, with a lucid presentment of the problems involved. The
same number of the Hibbert Journal contains an interesting
article by Mr. John W. Graham, Principal of Dalton Hall,
University of Manchester, discussing especially the characteristics
of the " Myers control " as represented in tlie scripts. The
subject of cross-correspondences is also dealt with by Mrs.
VeiTall in the JVew Quarterly for January.
In the Contemporary Review for the same month appears an
article on " The Pedigree of Christian Science," by Mr. Podmore.

GENEPtAL MEETING.
The 133rd General Meeting of the Society was held in the
large Hall at 20 Hanover Square, London, W., on Thursday,
January 28th, 1909, at 5 p.m.; the President, Mrs. Henry
Sidgwick, in the chair.
Professor William James's " Preliminary Eeport on Mrs.
Piper's Hodgson Control " was read by Mr. J. G. Piddington ;
in it Professor James described the earliest communications
purporting to come from Dr. Hodgson, and gave in detail a
few of the most salient incidents of that period, with a dis-
cussion of the evidence for and against their supernormal
character. It is hoped that the whole Eeport will appear
later in the Proceedings.
EEPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1908.
The membership of the Society has again increased consider-
ably during the year. 37 new Members were elected and
one Associate became a Member ; 117 new Associates were
Feb., 1909. Report of the Council. 37
elected and 9 Members became Associates. On the other
hand, the total loss in numbers from various causes was 30
Members and 82 Associates, leaving a net increase of 52.
The total membership has now reached 1190, the numbers being
distributed as follows: Members 290 (including 25 Honorary
and Corresponding Members); Associates 900 (including 15
Honorary Associates).
During this year two long reports have been issued on the
automatic scripts of Mrs. Holland, Mrs. Piper, Mrs. Verrall,
and Miss Verrall. These scripts, as is well known, have in
late years greatly developed in interest and complexity, and
the second report in particular shows what laborious and pene-
trating study and comparison of the different scripts with one
another are required to bring out their significance. A con-
siderable amount of public interest has been aroused by the
reports, as shown by articles in the Spectator, Nation, Hibhert
Journal, Nevj Quarterly, etc., as well as by unusually large
sales to outsiders of the Proceedings containing them. Experi-
ments are being actively continued with all the automatists
concerned and much fresh material has accumulated which it
is hoped may be presented to the Society before long.
Among other woi'k undertaken by members of the Society
during the year, we may mention a fresh series of experiments
in thought-transference at a distance carried out by Miss Miles
and Miss Kamsden, an account of which was given at one of
the Private Meetings and printed in the Journal for June
and an enquiry into the alleged miraculous nature of certain
hailstones that fell at Eemiremont (Vosges) in May, 1907, and
were said to have an image of the Virgin imprinted on them.
The expenses of this enquiry were generously defrayed by a
Member of the Society who took a special interest in the case;
and the investigation was carried out by Monsieur M. Sage,
whose report will appear in Part LVI. of the Proceedings.
In November the Council commissioned Mr. Feilding to
undertake a series of sittings with Eusapia Paladino at Naples.
He was accompanied by Mr. Hereward Carrington, and Mr.
Baggally afterwards joined them. Eleven sittings were held
during November and December, and it is hoped that a full
report of the investigation will appear in the Proceedings.
In May the Council adopted a scheme for the establishment

and recognition of Local Sections of the Society under condi-
tions specified in the Journal for June, and a Local Section was
then founded at Dublin, with the Eev. Dr. Barlow, late Vice-
Provost of Trinity College, as Chairman, Professor Barrett, F.li.S.,
as Vice-Chairman, and Mr. E. E. Fournier d'Albe, B.Sc, as Hon.
Secretary. This Section has now a membership of 75, and
the Council look forward to valuable results from the vigour
and activity already shown by it.
In June the ofiices of the Society at 20 Hanover Square
were enlarged by the addition of a convenient room for the
Research Officer, for whom up to that time accommodation had
had to be found elsewhere.
Mr. E. A. H. Bickford-Smith resigned the post of Secretary
and Editor at the end of the year. The Council have appointed
Miss Isabel ISTewton, formerly Assistant Secretary, as Secretary
and Sub-Editor, and Miss Johnson, Editor as well as Eesearch
Officer.
The Council record with regret the death of their original
Secretary, Mr. E. T. Bennett, who had served the Society faith-
fully for twenty years.
Two General and four Private Meetings of the Society (for
Members and Associates only) were held during the year. The
dates and the subjects of the papers read were as follows

CASE.
G. 284. Apparition.
The following account of an apparition seen by several different
persons was received from Dr. J. H. Gower, who interviewed
the witnesses and collected their evidence. His first report of
it was as follows
19 Steele Block, Denver, Colo.,
August 5th, 1908.
Last Christmas the body of a man employed in one of our
business buildings was found dead at the bottom of the elevator
shaft.
Eecently an apparition answering the description of the dead man
has been seen by three or four people at different times in the
midnight hours in the engine room of the same building. Neither
of the parties seeing the ghost knew the deceased at all, and it was
therefore only by the description given that my friend, who runs
the building, could place him.
I carefully examined the engine room, and believe it would be
almost impossible for a "joker" to make his escape. I have closely
questioned the percipients and am quite impressed by their declara-
tions. They, at least, are quite convinced that they have seen the
" real thing." On the first occasion it shook up a sleeping fireman,
and when he was about to expostulate with it for rough treatment
it vanished. On each occasion it appears to have been "sensible to
touch as to sight." The case has been given to me to investigate,
and I shall try to visit the scene at night ;
maybe I shall see it
myself. . . .
John H. Gower.
Dr. Gower's next letter on the subject was as follows
19 Steele Block, Denver, Colo.,
A^ov. 9th, 1908.
Enclosed please find particulars so far obtained of the Ghost Case
about which I wrote you some time ago.
Upon the receipt of Mr. Roberton's letter of Aug. 3rd, I went
down to the building for the purpose of making inquiries. I spent
over an hour in questioning the men and examining the place where
the apparition was seen. The sworn statements give you a fair
42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1909.
idea of what was said on that occasion and all subsec^uent statements
Avere entirely of a corroborative nature. I have not yet seen Ellis,
but I understand that his experiences were very similar to the
others, with the exception that he scm nothing, but the ghost
handled him in the same uncanny manner that it had handled the
others.
The room in which the phenomenon occurred is a very small one
and is very difficult of access. It is situated in the basement of
one of the office buildings in this city, and to reach it one has to
climb down a short ladder way from an entrance somewhat of the
trapdoor kind.
The room is well filled with machinery—a compressor-tank—and
it is only with difficulty that one can move about in it, although it
is well lighted by electricity. It has no door, but an entrance,
through which a man of more than ordinary size would have to
squeeze himself. I mention this because it was quite clear to me
that an attempt to play "spooks" here would have resulted in
being caught in the act immediately.
The men stood a pretty severe cross-examination on all occasions,
both hy Dr. Rogers and myself, without weakening in any particular,
and I was much struck by the open way in which they gave their
evidence, and am quite impressed by the fact, that they all fully
believe that they have seen the real thing. . . .
I should add that I understand that none of the men knew the
engineer who was killed personall}' ; but that it was entirely from
the description given of the apparition that Mr. Roberton was
able to recognize the likeness, which seems to have been quite
remarkable as to detail.
I will send Ellis' statement as soon as I obtain it, together with
any further information that you may wish to have.
John H. Gower.
The statements enclosed by Dr. Govver were as follows
Denver, Colo., Aug. 3, 1908.
Dear Dr. Gower, —About a week before last Christmas the
Engineer of the Block was found dead in bottom of front
Elevator Shaft. His successor, 2 night engineers and the wife of
one of them, I understand, declare that an apparition answering
the description of the dead Engineer has been appearing to them
recently in the dead of night in the Engine Room. If there is
anything in this to interest you I will be glad to introduce j'ou

to the parties interested (burring the principal) any time you care
to call here.
Frank Roberton.
Denver, Colo., Nov. 7, 1908.
Dear Dr. Gower,—-I enclose herewith sworn statements of
Wm. Kelley and Wm. Norder, engineers of the Block, and
of Mrs. Norder, in reference to the Psychical Phenomena experi-
enced by them in the Block.
You ask me to include a statement from mj'self, but tiie only
statement I can make is that about a week before Christmas, 1907,
an engineer of the block was killed in the elevator shaft, and the
engineers whose statements are included were, of course, aware of
this accident, and naturally connect the apparition with the
deceased engineer. Anything further that I might add would only
be a repetition of the statements made by the parties already
named.
Trusting this will be all that is necessary, I remain,
Yours very truly,
Frank Roberton {CasJder).
Bill Kellej', Night Engineer of the Block, states that
about the 10th of June, 1908, about a week before he started to
work in this building, he was visiting the night engineer of the
building, and while the latter was making his round of the building
at 12 o'clock midnight, he lay down in the corner of the com-
pressor room, underneath the tank, which was located a few feet
above him. He was sleeping in this position when he felt a hard
rap on his shoulder. He jumped up suddenly, and in doing so
struck his head against the tank, and at the same time his atten-
tion was arrested by seeing a figure standing just inside of the
open doorway (there being no door leading from the compressor
room into the boiler room).
He states that the figure was that of a man about 25 years to
30 years of age, of medium height, dressed in the regulation
overalls and dark cap of an engineer; that he was of slight build
and pale complexion and smooth-shaven face, and what hair was
visible on his head was of a light colour.
A month or so later than this he was standing in the boiler
room at the rear of the boilers oiling one of the valves leading to
the water tank, and resting his arm on one of the pipes, when his
arm slipped and he commenced swearing, when he heard a low
44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1909.
mumbling voice a short distance away and looked in that direction,
but saw nothing. He then went on with his swearing, and dis-
tinctly heard a voice immediately behind him say, " Don't do that.
I wouldn't do that. You don't gain anything by swearing. I
wouldn't do that." Glancing over his shoulder and seeing nothing
around he became alarmed, and dropping his oil-can made a bolt
for the front end of the boiler room. This happened about 2
o'clock in the afternoon.
Wm. Kelley.
Kelley also states that Bill Norder, chief engineer, and his wife,
and a fireman named Ellis, have all seen this same figure ; that
Bill Norder told him that he was sitting in his chair in the com-
pressor room when something took hold of his foot and shook it,
and when he looked up suddenly he saw a figure standing in the
doorway and answering the same general description as the figure
which had appeared to him. At the time this figure appeared to
them there were three electric lights burning in the room, and as
soon as they saw the figure it vanished.
Kelley also states that Mrs. Norder (his sister) told him that
she was sitting in the chair in the compressor room one night
while her husband was making his round of the building about 10
o'clock in the evening. She was sitting in the compressor room
with her knees crossed when she distinctly felt some one take hold
of her foot and push it down on the floor alongside the other foot,
and that this happened repeatedly, and that on one occasion she
felt something shake her by the shoulder when she was sitting in
the same place dozing and until she roused up and saw standing
immediately in front of her a figure which she described practi-
cally the same as the figure described by Kelley.
Kelley also states that the man named Ellis, who worked there
a short time as night engineer on the building, saw this figure on
more than one occasion, and became so disturbed at it that he quit
work after a short time.

Frank Roberton, Notary Public.
Bill Norder, day engineer of the Block, says he has been
working here as night engineer about 2 months, when one night
about 11 o'clock, he was sitting in the chair in the corner of the
compressor room reading an engineer book, when he felt something

grab him by the foot and shake it, and thinking it might be a fireman
just amusing himself, did not pay any attention to it until the same
thing occurred again very emphatically, when he looked up and saw
a figure standing in front of him, within an arm's length, staring
straight at him. Bill Norder said " What the you want 1
and jumped up, when the figure vanished completely.
This figure he described as of medium height and slight build,
about 26 years of age, and dressed in ordinary working clothes of
an engineer, also of a pale complexion and light auburn hair. He
then started out into the boiler room to investigate thoroughly, but
could see nothing. He said to himself that it could not be any-
thing human and get out of sight that quick. That was the only
time he ever saw anything of the sort, either there or elsewhere,
although he had often been on night picket duty with the U.S.
Army around Manilla, sometimes on graveyard picket duty, where
the surroundings were such as might tend to cause a person of
imagination to think that they saw such apparitions.
Norder states that the feeling he experienced was exactly as if
some one had taken firmly hold of his foot and shaken it, and as
he looked up, the figure was standing quietly in front of him and
smiling.

Notary Public.
Mrs. Norder, wife of Wm. Norder, engineer of the Block,
states that soon after her husband went to work in this building,
about 2 o'clock one morning, when her husband was away on one
of his rounds of the building, she was sitting by the desk in the
compressor room and leaning back in the chair in a light sleep,
when she felt something take hold of her shoulder and shake her,
first one side and then the other, until she was completely awake.
Looking up she saw standing before her a figure, and having had
similar experiences many times before in her life, she looked at it
steadily and critically. She states that it was diessed in overalls
and in an under-shirt, and had the general appearance of an
engineer or fireman.
Mrs. Norder stated that she had heard that an engineer had been
killed in the building some time previous, but had never given the
matter more than a passing thought. She did not at the time tell
her husband anything about the appearance of this figure, thinking
Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1909.
that it would only make him nervous ; but some time afterwards,
when he was sitting in the same place, the figure appeared to him,
and when he described it to her, it agreed exactly with the
description of the figure which she had seen, and which she had
described to a neighbour, whom she got to corroborate her testimony
to her husband. She states that at the time this figure appeared
to her she felt perfectly at ease, and was in a condition to notice
carefully the details of its appearance, but that after her husband
returned she felt somewhat nervous at the idea of remaining alone,
so she accomiDanied him on his further rounds that night.
On another occasion, about 10 o'clock at night, she went to the
building to take her husband's supper, and while sitting alongside
of him in the compressor room, she felt distinctly what seemed to
be a hand grasping her foot and moving it off to one side on the
floor several inches, and thinking to see if it would continue, she
placed iier foot back again in its original position several times,
and each time had the same experience, but did not at that time
see anything.

Mrs. Norder states further that she had on several occasions
seen apparitions of persons known to her, both living and dead,
but " had never paid much attention to psychical matters."
Dr. Gower writes later :
December 3rd, 1908.
. . . Ellis's statement (which I expect in a few days) will, I
understand, be to the effect that he felt the ghost, but did not see
it. This seems to me important as dispelling the theory of trick
or joke, as by no possible means could a joker have shaken Ellis
in the engine room without showing himself and being spotted at
once. . . .
In another letter, dated January 26th, 1909, Dr. Gower
tells us that Ellis has been lost sight of, so that it has not
been possible to obtain his evidence.
The following further statement was received by Dr. Gower
from Mr. Eoberton :
Denver, Colo., Dec 2, 1908.
Replying to your inquiries suggested by a recent letter from the
Psychical Societj' in London, I have seen Norder, and he says that
Feb., 1909. Case. 47
before the appearance which he describes he had heard Kelley and
some of the other boys talking of what had been seen in the Boiler
Room, but had not heard any detailed description of the figure
alleged to have been seen. He treated the matter as a joke at
that time, and did not pay any particular attention to it, but he
adds that no one could now convince him that he did not see
clearly the figure which he describes, or did not experience the
shaking, etc., of which he speaks.
I have also inquired of each of the parties testifying, and find that
none of them had ever met the engineer who was killed. . . .

THE DOWSING EOD.
By Professor W. r. Barrett.
Since I published my monograph on the so-called divining or
dowsing rod a vast accumulation of additional evidence has
reached me. Some of it is of considerable value, but at
present I have neither time nor courage to sift the whole of
this mass of material. It is, however, I think, desirable to
publish the following letters as affording evidence on behalf
of the dowser from men of some distinction and accustomed
to weigh evidence.
The first letter is from Sir John Franks, K.C.B., the Secretary
to the Irish Land Commission, who writes
Dalriada, Blackrock, Co. Dublin, May 28, 1902.
Dear Professor Barrett, —I want to make searcli for water on
a farm I have in Co. Kilkenny and I am told no one can advise
better as to the modus operandi than you ; so perhaps, if not too
much trouble, you will give me the benefit of suggestions on the
subject.
The lands lie at an elevation of from 100 to 440 feet, and are
bounded by a stream at tlie lowest level, and there are good wells
or rather springs close together at an elevation of about 200 feet.
On the old Ordnance map (made in 1836) there are some wells
which had been afterwards marked (probably by my father) in quite
another part of the farm, but these have not been wanted for many
years past, and there is nothing on the surface to show where they
were. They would be of use now, if water is to be found. . . .
J. H. Franks.
I gave Sir John Franks the name of an amateur dowser
living on the borders of Co. Kilkenny, viz. Mr. J. H. Jones,
of Mullinabro, Co. Waterford. Mr. Jones met Sir John at
his place, with the following result
Dalriada, Blackrock, Co. Dublin, Sept. 14, 1902.
Dear Professor Barrett,— ... I was quite astonished at the
lesults of the tests to which I subjected [Mr. Jones's] work and
methods, before I incurred the expense and trouble of sinking for
water at the place indicated by him.
He had never been over the ground before, and there is nothing
Mae., 1909. The Dowsing Rod. 51
on the Ordnance sheets (which are very old) to indicate the
position of the old wells mentioned before. I made three tests by
bringing him from 100, 200, 800 yards away from these wells,
which are only apparent when qtdte dose, with no paths lead-
ing to them. He quartered the ground back and forwards
like a dog looking for game, and after some delay in each
case eventually found a flow, and the direction [of the flow].
Once the direction was found, he followed it steadily, working
back and forwards across flow, till without aid he hit off the
place where the concealed wells are. The last test was quite
wonderful, as I brought him quite half a mile away to the top
of the watershed, to a place from which he could not have had
an idea where the well opened, in a spot quite out of sight until
one got within two yards of it, but he hit it off with absolute
accuracy. In the place where he indicated a site to sink for a
new well there were no surface indications at all, and it was quite
half a mile away from any of the old wells. We had to cut and
blast principally through solid rock, 38 feet down, before we hit
the spring. There are now 20 feet of water in this Avell.
J. H. Franks.
Three other remarkable cases in which Mr. Jones was
successful when other attempts, some under expert geological
advice, had failed, I have investigated. The evidence in these
cases is, however, too long to quote here ; one was at the model
farm at Glasnevin, Co. Dublin, under the Department of Agri-
culture and Technical Instruction ; another was at Dunganstown
Eectory, Co. Wicklow, a very striking case, concerning which I
have detailed reports, and have myself visited the spot and
verified the statements ;
another was at the National Consump-
tive Hospital, Newcastle, Co. Wicklow, which, at a critical time,
saved the Hospital from a water famine.
Through the kindness of Sir Oliver Lodge I have received
the following letters. The dowser referred to in Mr. Andrew
Lang's letter is Mr. E. Howson, of Middlesboro', a gentleman
with whom I have had a good deal of correspondence, and who
has also been very successful in dowsing for minerals
MoNREiTH, Whauphill, N.B., July 15, 1907.
Dear Lodge,—An amazing dowser has been staying here, a gentle-
man, a land agent in Lancashire. My host. Sir Herbert Maxwell,
F.E,.S., is not a very credulous philosopher, but what he tells me
52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1909.
of the man's success in tracking people here, and finding hidden
things, beats anything I have heard of. I understand that the agent
has electrical theories on the subject. If you care to know more
about and try to see this gentleman I will give you his address, if
he consents, and some particulars.
A. Lang.
The next account was written by Mr. Jesse Ceilings, M.P.,
at Sir Oliver Lodge's request, and is as follows
Edgbaston, Feby. 1, 1909.
My Dear Sir Oliver,— . . . The dowsing incident took place
during the last annual excursion of the British Dairy Farmers' Asso-
ciation. About a dozen of us were going through a field —a short
cut—to rejoin the others who were on the road. The question of
water-divining came up, and Mr. Walker, a well-known journalist who
was with the excursionists, cut a twig from a tree in the middle
of the field. It was this shape [sketch omitted].
He grasped it in his hands [by the two ends]. The field was
a dry hilly one, and we all went down to a "bottom" which
was swampy. As we came close to the wet swamp the top of
the twig steadily rose-—indeed the whole of it —to about this angle
or more, and when we left the swamp it gradually fell back into
position. Several of the farmers present tried it without any effect
whatever. Mr. AValker said that very few could do it. I think
he said not one in a hundred or one in a thousand, I forget
which.
Being very sceptical, I took the twig and we went down to the
" bottom " again, when the twig rose as we approached the water,
higher and more deliberately than before. Though I had grasped
the ends very tightly I suggested that the parts in my hands had
turned and so turned the other part of the twig. Mr. Walker
then cut notches at the ends of the parts held in my hands. On
renewing the experiment the twig behaved exactly as before, while
the notches showed that the parts held in the hands had not revolved
or moved in any way.
What followed astonished us still more. Mr. AValker took a very
thick twig—speaking from memory about \ in. or fths thick. He
notched the ends and grasped them in the same manner, and on
getting near the water the part not held rose up with such force
that the arms of the twig being too thick to yield twisted them-
selves to such an extent [between his hands and the apex] that
Mak., 1909. The Dowsing Rod. 53
the rind was broken and the inside skin was laid bare and twisted,
and but for the fibrous character of the wood would have dropped
off altogether. It looked like a rope instead of the smooth stick
it was before. As it was it became listless with no further animation.
The parts grasped, as shown by the notches, had not moved or
turned in the least. Mr. Walker stated that this experiment hurt
his wrists, as he had to hold the ends with all his force to prevent
them following the motion of the other parts.
I certainly should not have believed in the experiments if I had
not seen them. As it is I have no theory to advance, but simply
describe—accurately, I think—what I saw, and what others present
did not pretend to doubt or dispute.
Jesse Collings.
Mr. Jesse Ceilings' experience is similar to others I have
already given in my published reports, and to the following,
which my friend Dean Ovenden has kindly written at my
request. The Dean, I may mention, has published some useful
little books on elementary science, hence he does not take
refuge in the usual electricity theory, albeit nothing will shake
his conviction that some force external to the dowser moves
the rod. The unanimity with which all dowsers hold this
view shows how distinct from our conscious personality are the
involuntary actions of our sub-conscious life.
Chanter Hill, Enniskillen,
Nov. 22, 1906.
Dear Professor Barrett, —I knew nothing about dowsing, I
never saw a dowsing rod nor a dowser. My mental attitude towards
the subject was the same as about apparitions, viz. I had heard of
apparitions and dowsers, but both were absolutely outside my personal
experience.
On Tuesday, the 13th inst., I went to Eossory Glebe as the Bishop's
representative on a commission of repairs and dilapidations, a new
rector having been appointed. We found in the corner of an old
kitchen a small well of clear water. The outside well was 39 feet
from the ground to the surface of the water. We asked the outgoing
rector where the clear water came from which supplied the indoor
well. He replied, "I don't know." Mr. Jervois, the district R.B.
architect, said, "Come out until we look for the source." He cut a
forked twig of a suowberry bush shaped like a Y. Then he held
his elbows to his sides and his palms upward, the little fingers
54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1909.
being next one another. He bent the forks of the twig outwards
and gripped them at [the two ends], with the point projecting hori-
zontally before him. I noticed that he held the bent forks very
tightly. In this attitude he walked across the bank sloping towards
the rectory. For some time the stick remained pointing straight
outwards ; then, suddenly, as he crossed a certain spot, the twig bent
upwards violently and hit him on the chest. He was holding it so
tightly that the parts held in his hands could not turn, and the
wrench broke the stick like an untwisted cord. I was amazed. He
passed by the spot and the twig remained inert ; but going back-
wards and forwards, always at the same spot, where the stream was
running underground, the twig leaped upwards. He said, " Now
touch my hand and you will neutralise the effect." I laid my hand
loosely on his closed fist and we passed over the spot without any
movement in the stick. Being more surprised, I said, " Let me try
it." He said, " You would be no good, for you stopped my power
by touching me." However, I held the twig as he did, having cut
off the broken part, and when I passed the spot I felt the light twig
suddenly become as heavy as if it were made of steel and was being
pulled downward by a strong magnet. I held it as tightly as I
could close my strong hands, but in spite of my efforts it twisted
round and pointed downwards.
Mr. Jervois said (and I heard this for the first time in my life)
that with most dowsers it did point downwards.
The next day I cut a forked snowberry twig here and went out
to make experiments in the garden. Passing down one of the walks
the stick insisted on pointing downwards until I reached a spot where
it became light again. I left the walk where the drag ceased and
crossed the earth bed where potatoes had been. Immediately the
stick began to drag downwards. The gardener said, "You are right,
sir, for that's where the drain goes off towards the pond. I found
it when I was digging." Knowing nothing of the drainage of the
old garden, and not being sure that the drains were where the stick
indicated them, I called out my daughter and put the stick in her
hands, but go where she would over the spots which I had passed,
she felt nothing. I therefore went to the avenue gate, where I knew
that the water supply of Enniskillen crossed the road. The moment
I came over the pipe the stick pulled downwards with a force which
I could not resist. Just then a small boy, aged about 12, passed by
with some baskets. I told him nothing, but asked him to hold the
stick as I placed it in his hands and to walk down the road [opposite
Mar., 1909. The Dowsing Rod. 55
to and away from the gate]. When he came to [a certain] point he
called out, "I can't hould it, sir, it's lepping." He reversed his walk
and I walked beside him. At [this same point] I saw that he
struggled to hold the stick out straight and could not prevent it
from pointing straight down towards the earth.
On Monday last an engineer, Mr. Allman, came here to pay a
visit. I took him outside the hall door and gave him the same twig,
which bj' then was not fresh. He detected the drain from the house
foundations at once. He did not know where the water pipe crossed
the road, but at the same point at the avenue gate the stick felt so
heavy that it twisted itself down. He and I crossed the lawn, and
easily detected every drain in it. Coming to the house, he said,
"My fingers are all cramped trying to hold that stick against its
extraordinary pressure."
Mr. Allman was as ignorant of the phenomenon as I was. He was
much interested, and has taken away the stick to find water for his
father-in-law, at whose house there is a great scarcity. I may mention
that when I held the stick over a water barrel and over the garden
pond it was absolutely inert and remained as a light twig pointing
out straight before me.
These are the plain facts, from which I inier that . . . [your]
suggestion that the motion of the twig is due to unconscious muscular
action is wholly incompatible with my experience. Obviously, having
seen Mr. Jervois' twig turn upwards, if there were any mental sug-
gestion, it was that mine should do the same, but, contrary to my
expectation, it did exactly the opposite. I felt a downward drag
which I was unable to resist, although employing all my muscular
force in the opposite direction. Mr. AUman's hands were blistered
in his efforts to prevent the twig from turning. There was, I am
convinced, a force external to myself pulling against me. [See p. 59.]
In the case of Mr. Jervois that force acted in an upward direction,
and in my case in a downward direction, and when I touched him
on the hand the upward and the downward forces neutralized one
another, so that the twig remained inert. . . .
I send you a snowberry twig, the same as I used.
Yours very sincerely,
Charles T. Ovenden,
Dean of Clogher.
P.S.—I have just tested these sticks. The snowberry twig is much
more sensitive than the hazel.
56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1909.
I have investigated a number of cases of remarkable success
which Miss Miles had in water-finding. The followin'? is a strik-
ing case, as it comes from the authorities at the Curragh Camp,
where good potable water is difficult to obtain and a supply was
needed for a memorial hospital. Captain Greer writes
Crotanstown, The Curragh,
Co. KiLDARE, September &th, 1903.
The facts relating to the finding of water to supply the Drogheda
Memorial Hospital are as follows :
The AVoods and Forests Department offered a site on The Cur-
ragh for the building of the hospital for a small rent. Before
accepting this offer the committee responsible for the building had
to assure themselves that a water supply to the hospital could be
secured.
Miss Miles, hearing of these circumstances, kindly consented to
endeavour to find by " divining " whether a spring existed, under-
ground, in the portion of land embraced in the proposed site for
the hospital. (This occurred in the winter of 1896-97 : I think
January, 1897.) She came here and visited the proposed site with
Mrs. Greer and me. She went backwards and forwards over the
site with the divining rod, and for some time could not find a
spring, though she informed us that there was a large deposit of
surface water (she thought about 15 ft. under the surface). After
considerable search she came on a genuine spring, which, after
measuring, she said was about 45 to 50 ft. underground, and quite
separate from the deposit of surface drainage. By my orders a well
was sunk on the spot over which Miss Miles declared the spring
existed. At 17 feet we came on an apparently plentiful supply of
water, which resisted an endeavour to pump it dry, lasting for eight
hours, and we were convinced, in spite of Miss Miles' caution about
the surface water, that this was the spring, and we actually built
in the well and connected the water supply to the hospital. This
supply, however, turned out to be surface water. On analysis it
• was declared to be of moderate quality, and was used only for
washing, drinking water being obtained from a house close to the
hospital, which was then a small institution.
In the following spring the well, which had contained 4 to 5 ft.
of water, went dry, and then for the first time we realised that
Miss Miles must have been correct in her diagnosis, and that we
had made a well to contain what was merely surface drainage.
Mak., 1909. The Dotvsing Rod. 57
I sunk through the bottom of the well with an Artesian borer,
and found at 43 ft. a strong spring of perfectly pure water, which
has provided the hospital with a perfect water supply ever since.
J. H. Greer.
I gave several cases of the successful use of dowsing in
America in niy monograph. The late Dr. Hodgson sent me
many more : here is one of some interest, as it is from the
engineer to the Mount Whitney Power Co. in California
ViSALiA, California, May 20th, 1905.
The method that some of the well-borers use in locating wells
is by means of a forked "switch" or stick cut from a live tree.
They say that the particular kind of a tree makes no difference,
the only requirement being that the tree be alive. In using the
switch the operator grasps the two branches of the fork in his
hands and holds the switch upright; with the switch in this posi-
tion he slowly walks over the ground which he is exploring for
water. If an underground stream is passed over, this is indicated
by the movement of the switch downward, like a pointer. Men
with whom I have talked say that, when the underground stream
is passed over, they can feel the switch twitch or jerk in their
hands, and that they can feel the tendency of the switch to point
downwards, the hands simply following this movement. They also
say that they can tell roughly or approximately the amount of
water in the stream and the depth below the surface at which it
will be found.
I do not recall now a single well that has been bored wliere
indicated by the switch that has been a failure ; on the other hand
many wells not so located have been failures.
Some of the evidence that appears rather convincing to me is
as follows :
The company of which I am superintendent had occasion to bore
a well at Lindsay for the town waterworks. This well I had bored
at a point most convenient with respect to the buildings ; the well-
borer at this time said that no water or little water would be
found, for the stream was twelve feet south of the point selected.
The well, however, was bored down to a depth of one hundred and
fifty feet, a small quantity of water was found, but the amount was
insuiEcient. The next year (1903) another well was bored, this
time at the point indicated by the switch twelve feet south of the
first one, and an abundant supply of water was found.
58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae., 1909.
Mr. Robert Berry, of Lindsay, located this well, as well as many
others throughout that section.
Another instance occurred at Lindsay Heights, where several wells
were located by Mr. Berry for Messrs. Hammond and Wishon,
president and manager of this company respectively.
Mr. Wishon was on the ground when Mr. Berry was exploring
for the wells; and as he was rather sceptical about the method, he
thought he would try it himself, and was surprised to find that
the switch would respond for him as well as it would for Mr.
Berry. To check the matter further he had Mr. Berrj' walk two
or three rods ahead of him over the ground with their switches in
position. As Mr. Berry would pass over a stream he wouhl
indicate it ; as Mr. Wishon came to the same point he would say
each time :
" Yes, I feel it."
Two or three times, to tr}' him, Mr. Berry would not say any-
thing when he passed over a stream. As Mr. Wishon came over
these places he would say: "Here, Bob, you missed one." This
occurred several times.
Another test that I knew of was made by Mr. James N.
Reynolds, of Lindsay. He engaged Mr. Berry to locate a well for
him on a certain piece of land ; the point selected Mr. Reynolds
privately marked. He then engaged another man, and had him
locate a well on the same piece of land. This second man, after
exploring about with his switch, selected the identical spot that
Mr. Reynolds had marked ; a well has since been bored at this
point, and a supply of water has been found. . . .
Cahl H. Holley.
As regards the explanation of the dowsing rod, I have seen
nothing to shake the conclusions which were given in my
last report {Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XV., pp. 313 and 314).
That there is no special property possessed by running water
which affects the dowser is shown by his discovery of under-
ground mineral ores, oil wells, etc. Concerning the latter, Miss
Margaret Benson informed me, on the authority of a personal
friend who knew the facts, that in locating the exact spot for
sinking for petroleum wells in Peru scientific experts are not
employed, but always " instinctive experts." A dowser is an
instinctive expert, and we may call his peculiar instinct " a
sub-conscious transcendental perceptive faculty," as I have done,
or anything else we like. The Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, who
has both read and seen much about dowsers, writes to me
Mae., 1909. The Dowsing Rod. 5!)
" All the evidence that I have seen or heard of entirely supports
your conclusions, strange though they may appear."
That the vigorous motion of the rod, one limb often being
broken, is really caused by the unconscious muscular action
of the dowser is, as I have said, hotly contested by every
dowser, who is persuaded the twig moves his hands, and not
vice versa. For example. Dr. Eshelby, of Stockton House, near
Worcester, writing to me about a young farmer in his
neighbourhood, named Skyrne, who is a very successful dowser,
says :
" He (Skyrne) tries to resist the motion of the rod, and
I assured myself of this by clasping his hands tightly in
mine and then walked over a buried pipe of running water
at nio'ht-time. The moment we came over where we subse-
(|uently found the pipe to be, the sensation was as though
some one had seized the apex of the forked branch and forcibly
pulled it dov/n. Our hands resisted this downward movement,
and the two sides of the forked twig gave way at the spot
where they left his hands, and showed a green-stick fracture.
I certainly should have detected any muscular movement
sufficient to break the forked stick, and I know he did not move
his hands or wrist, as I had hold of them all the time."
The extraordinary and often violent motion of the rod was
naturally enough during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
attributed to supernormal agency, good or mischievous demons
as the case might be. Later on, when the use of the rod for
finding underground water became more general than its use
for locating underground ore and buried treasure, some attrac-
tive force exerted by the water was urged by the Abbe de
Vallemont and other Cartesian philosophers. But that remark-
able man, who was really the founder of modern experimental
science, the learned Jesuit, Father A. Kircher, showed that if
the rod were delicately suspended on some fixed support, no
motion whatever was produced on the approach of water or
metals. Kircher, two centuries before Chevreul and Carpenter,
discovered the agency of involuntary muscular action.^ There
are no cases, so far as I know, where any one has shown the
rod will move over underground water unless held by the
dowser. It is not any known physical force that attracts the rod.
^ See my report Proceedinr/s S.P.R., Vol. XV., p. 276; also Kircher's
Mu7idu.i Subterraneus, 1646, Vol. II., p. 200.

One cannot deny the possibility that some unknown force
may be concerned, but what we know of unconscious and in-
voluntary muscular action is adequate to explain the ordinary
sudden movements of the forked twig. There are, it is true,
certain extraordinary cases which stretch this hypothesis almost
more than it can bear. Such cases are worth careful investi-
gation by a trained anatomist. It is possible we may have
to fall back on an involuntary, unconscious cxteriorisation of
the muscular force of the dowser. If so, it would bring the
motion of the rod into the same category as many of the
" physical phenomena " of spiritualism : for I am convinced
there is a much closer connection than is at present recog-
nised between these latter phenomena and the actual physical
personality of the medium.
POSSIBLE AUTOMATISM OF YOUNG CHILDEEN.
By Sir Oliveij Lodge.
It occurs to me that perhaps we have paid insufficient attention
to what is sometimes called genius, but which may be a
variety of automatism, as displayed by young children.
If, for instance, it were possible to obtain sensible automatic
writing from a very young child, it would be proof of some-
thing supernormal. But the obvious objection is that it is
probably impossible. The only thing that suggests anything
in the direction of its possibility is the existence of musical
prodigies, able to play the piano by instinct long before they
can have learnt. The most striking case of this, known to
me, is the Spanish boy Pepito Eodriguez Arriola, who is stated
to have begun at the age of two and a half and to have
played before musicians and crowned heads before, or about
the time that, he was three years old. This boy is authentic,
as he was seen and reported on by Professor Eichet, when
his age was between three and four ; and one of my sons saw
the child at Professor Eichet's house.
I have looked up Professor Eichet's report, which is con-
tained in the Annates cles Sciences Psychiques for 1900, p. 324.
It appears that Pepito, who was born in December, 1896,
sometimes pretended to write music, but his attempts were
obviously only imitative, and had no meaning. He did, how-
Ma»r., 1909. Possible Automatism of Young Children. 61
ever, frequently improvise on the piano, as well as play from
memory. Even if he had only lieard an air in the form of
a song, a few times, he could usually play it with adequate
harmonies. His execution was unequal. There were times
when he broke down and hesitated for half a minute or so,
and then suddenly, as if inspired, he began to play again
vv'ith skill and precision. But although his execution was
decidedly less than perfect, the amount of expression he got out
of his very inferior piano seems to have been amazing. " II a
une richesse d'expression etonnante," says Professor Eichet.
An abstract of Professor Eichet's paper is contained in the
Journal of the S.P.E., Vol. X., p. 20, where another not alto-
gether dissimilar case is also quoted, that of Mr. E. C. Eowe
of Cambridge, who at a later stage was known to me, as well
as to most Cambridge members of the Society. And in his
case even a printed musical score used to give him pleasure
at an extraordinarily early age.
It is probably worth noticing that musical notation has more
of a natural and less of an artificial character than ordinary
writing or printing has. Eelative pitch is clearly represented
by the spacing of the notes ; absolute pitch is indicated by
the simple, though crude, device of " signature
;
" and though
the duration of each sound is recorded in an entirely arbitrary
manner, yet the elementary convention involved is such as to
appeal readily to a very slightly instructed eye,—genius being,
of course, presupposed.
The only thing that is not at all represented by the notation
is the division into octaves, and the occurrence of musical
intervals generally. But apart from any knowledge of arith-
metical ratios among the frequencies,—the detection of which
involved a certain amount of scientific discovery,—the testhetic
appreciation of musical intervals must be regarded as a matter
of direct sensation, existent among people of quite ordinary
musical faculty, if not universal.
To return to Pepito. Since 1900 I have not heard of
him ; but a statement now appears in the papers that his
half-sister, now about four years old, has the same faculty,
being able to play classical music—by ear only, of course ;—
and a photograph has recently appeared in an illustrated paper
showing this child seated, with Pepito standing by her.
62. Journal of Society for Psycldcal Research. Mae., 1909.
ISIow, if it be true that a child of between two and four
years of age can play the piano, the question arises, Why
should they not write also ? To that question, however, I
suggest a definite answer.
The symbols of writing, and words themselves, are pure
conventions, having no relation whatever to actual things,
beyond convention and mutual agreement based upon historical
tradition. That is what makes the existing multiplicity of
human languages so profoundly unsatisfactory and hindering to
the progress of the race.
There is a certain amount of convention about the diatonic
scale in music, but the sequence of notes in the gamut does
correspond with something in nature ; while even the arrange-
ment of keys on a piano in regular order and succession may
be regarded as a natural, and not an artificial phenomenon. For
its artificiality is of the very simplest character, such as even a
child could understand, viz., a series of pieces of wood or bone
of equal widths, all associated with the notes of a regularly
ascending scale, and such that if any one is struck, the interval
necessary to reach any other note may be considered evident
to a musical genius. The harmonies producible by striking
notes simultaneously are also natural phenomena, such as can
excite direct and uninstructed appreciation. Hence the act of
instinctive playing, although surprising, must be considered
possible ; while the act of instinctive writing conventional words
in some human language may have to be considered impossible.
The question next arises : Is there anything else, then, that
can be done with the hands, of a more natural character
than writing ? And the answer is, I think, moulding and
drawing. About moulding there would seem to be a minimum
of convention. Drawing involves some perspective ;
but, after
all, that represents what the eye really sees, though an
untrained person is not aware of it. Hence it would seem
that an exceptional child might be expected to draw auto-
matically, although not to write.
It is possible that performances of this kind would not
attract as much attention from parents as a musical perform-
ance does, nor would they be so likely to be encouraged
but it may be well to be on the lookout for them. And it
is not wise to lay down any restriction as to what may turn
Mar., 1909. Possible Automatism of Young Children. 63
out to be possible, because few things can compete in prima
facie incredibility with elaborate musical execution from a
child of three.
A further possibility is worthy of attention. A child may
be old enough to be able to write normally, and yet be
unable to write anything beyond matter of infantile quality.
This would be the ordinary state of things ; but in excep-
tional cases it would seem as if it ought to be possible to
obtain, through such an automatist, ideas and language as
much beyond its normal capacity as classical music necessarily
is. The oft-quoted Greek and Hebrew recital of an ignorant
servant-girl was perhaps of this character, unless it is quite
apocryphal—as seems not unlikely ; at any rate, if any such cases
are known, they ought to be communicated to the Society.
But an obvious caution is necessary. If any such records
are ever obtained, parents and guardians ought to be very
careful not to allow the children to think that there is
anything uncanny in the proceeding, nor encourage an
unwholesome amount of attention to it. Wisely dealt with,
the script might be made available for scientific purposes
without confusing the normal mind of the child with specu-
lations concerning its origin and meaning. These may be
puzzling enougli to anybody, and should no more be emphasised
in the hearing of the automatist than any other effort of
genius should be. Emotion and excitement are utterly unneces-
sary and out of place in any scientific enquiry.
It is a commonplace to say that " prodigies " of any kind
require protection from themselves, or, rather, from the public
curiosity which they attract ;
but, as natural though rare
phenomena, they may be of the utmost interest for psychological
investigation of a careful and judicious character.

[This Report was held over from the February Journal for want

A Meeting of the Dublin Section was lield on Saturday,
December 19th, 1908, at 3.30 p.m., at the Leinster Lecture
Hall, Molesworth Street. Professor Barrett, F.Pi.S., Vice-
64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae., 1909.
Chairman, presided, and forty-seven members of the Section
were present.
The Chairman briefly reviewed the history of the Section
to date, and pointed out the various directions in which
researches could be undertaken by members.
Mr. Fournier d'Albe, Hon. Secretary, exhibited a modified
planchette, designed to test whether the writing produced was
ever done otherwise than by normal automatic muscular action.
It consisted of an ordinary planchette, from which the castors
had been removed. The planchette thereupon assumed an in-
clined position, the inclination to the paper depending solely
upon the length of the pencil. Such an inclined planchette could
be used for ordinary automatic writing without much ditticulty,
but as soon as a postcard was interposed between the hand
and the planchette, writing by normal muscular action became
impossible, as did also the drawing of a circle, or of any curve
having a component in the direction pointing from the tip of
the pencil towards the centre of the edge in contact with the
paper. The interposition of a postcard did not interfere with
the action of the ordinary planchette, for he had obtained such
writing (which appeared to be unconscious) with the postcard
interposed. As regards writing with the new " test plan-
chette," he thought he had obtained it on two occasions with
one writing medium, but until the experiment had been many
times repeated he could not be sure whether the test conditions
had been strictly observed.
At the request of the Chairman, Mr. T. H. Webb exhibited
and explained the action of the " Ouija," through which, he
said, he had obtained many communications purporting to come
from deceased relatives.
Professor Barrett gave a short summary of the theory of
cross-correspondences, with illustrations from his own experi-
ence and from the data accumulated by the Parent Society.
Canon Carmichael wished, he said, to rectify some errors
which had got abroad with respect to the objects of their Section.
Members were not necessarily identified with spiritualism or
with any other interpretation of the phenomena studied. All
that was expected of them was an open mind with regard to
the existence of supernormal phenomena, and a desire to take
some part in the laborious task of elucidating them.

"SPIEIT HANDS," SUGGESTION AND DOGS.
By Andrew Lang.
Moved by the discussion between Miss Johnson and Count
Solovovo as to the amount of hallucination caused by suggestion
at Home's and other seances, I wrote a paper in defence of
" Neolithic Metaphysics and Metapsychics." But for many good
reasons I spare the readers of the Journal, and merely draw
attention first to a very odd story of a visionary hand seen
" where nae hand should be," and without any traceable
suggestion, by an excellent witness, my niece, Miss Grieve.^
[G. 285.] The account was received by me on August 3rd,
1908, being as follows:
On Saturday, July 4th, [1908], I and my friend Miss Baughan
started on a cruise to Norwa)'. After seeing the fjords as far north
as Trondlijem we came south to Stavanger, which we reached Mondaj^,
July 13th.
We knew nothing whatever about the town beyond that there
was a cathedral and an old church now converted into a school.
After strolling round for some time we happened on what we thought
^ Some earlier experiences of Miss Grieve's have already been printed in the
Journal, namely a case of collective crj^stal vision (Vol. X., p. 13-t) ; a short
series of experiments in thought-transference (Vol. X., p. 260); and an appari-
tion of a friend, apparently visible also to Miss Grieve's ilog (Vol. XIII., p. 27,
February, 1907).
66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apkil, 1909.
was this old churcli (it was in reality the cathedral), and entered.
The moment I closed the door behind me I felt a strange and
decidedly unpleasant feeling—as if something or some one was present
I could not see. I looked at Miss Baughan to see if she noticed
anything, but she was already half-way up the aisle and deej) in the
dog-toothing and designs on the beautiful old Norman pillars and
arches. Quite suddenly, about 6 feet above my head and a little in
front of me, appeared a shadowy forearm and hand ; most conspicuous
was the hand, pointing. It hovered for a moment where I first saw
it and then slowly turned towards Miss Baughan, but passed her,
and pointed steadily towai'ds the chancel. Presently, from a side
chapel behind the chancel, came a man, apparently a tourist like
ourselves. The hand immediately pointed at him and followed him
wherever he went. After a few minutes he left the church, and the
visionary hand slowly faded from my sight. I regret to say I did
not say anything to Miss Baughan at the moment, but told her the
same evening when we got back to our hotel.
We looked into the cathedral on our way back in the evening
(before I told her of the vision) but there was no one there, and I
saw nothing and had no unpleasant feeling. The old verger outside
could not speak English at all, and neither of us had enough Norwegian
to inquire about legends, so we left Stavanger without any sort of
clue to the meaning of the vision. Immediately on my return to
Aberdeen, I went down to the Free Library and searched among
books on Norway for legends of Stavanger. At last in Norwegian
By-ways, by Charles W. Wood, I found an account which tallied in
almost every detail with my own experience.
B. H. Grieve.
Miss Baughan adds
Jnly Zlst [1908].
I was present with Miss Grieve in Stavanger Cathedral, on July
13th, and was given this account of the occurrence the same evening
by her.
M. R. Baughan.
In reply to various questions Miss Grieve wrote :
October llth, 1908.
... I certainly had never read or even heard of Norwegian By-ivays.
Had I done so the tale would certainly have lost interest from a
psychical point of view, but would have been far more interesting
to me, for I should have experimented (as the author did) and linked
arms with my friend to see if she could see the hand then.
April, 1909. " Spirit Hands," Suggestion and Bogs. 67
The arm ended at the elbow ; it was only a forearm, shadow-like
but white, and the hand much whiter and therefore more distinct.
The elbow end simply tailed off from white to grey to nearly black,
so that it faded into the surrounding shadows of the cathedral aisle,
about 10-12 feet above the ground.
It just appeared in mid-air, not from behind any obstacle. I had
been looking round uncomfortably for some minutes and could see
nothing, and quite suddenly the pointing hand was there where I
had looked many times before. No, the actual point where it left
off was not visible to me ; I saw as far as the elbow and then it
merged into the general atmosphere. The date was July 13th,
1908
B. H. Grieve.
Nonvcgian By-ways, by Charles W. Wood, was published in
1903. The following is the account there given (pp. 13-16):
Never can I forget an evening spent there [at Stavanger Cathedral]
years ago waiting for the steamer. . . .
We were a party of four friends, and the writer alone remains
to tell the tale. . . . We were the only Englishmen in the place
and waited the Bergen boat.
It was evening and a glorious sun was sinking westward. I
had obtained the key at the fire-station (it is still kept there) and
with some difficulty had persuaded the others to visit the cathedral.
Sport, they declared, was more in their line than architecture.
We strolled up the narrow, hilly street, and had it to ourselves.
Daylight was waning as the door slowly rolled back on its hinges,
and we all passed into the impressive silence and solitude of the
empty church. The Norman arches, softened by the gloaming,
stood out in all their beauty.
I don't know what it was, and shall never know, but as we walked
through the aisles criticising the work, noting the dog-tooth moulding
on the arches between the pillars, here and tliere varied by the
old Norwegian and interesting dragon-tracery—as we moved about
contemplating minute detail and general effect, a strange feeling
came over me, a sensation or conviction of some unseen presence
hovering about us. It thrilled me from head to foot with an
emotion never felt before and never since.
I glanced at the others. Two seemed absorbed in the building
and in that alone; the third, Sir John Dacre, youngest of all
he was only just twenty—was evidently under the same strange
68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1909.
influence. His face was pale, his eyes looked into vacancy. He
used to say that he had the gift of second sight ; and his mother,
old Lady Margaret, was descended from a long line of ancestors
who had all believed in or possessed the faculty to the point of
superstition. She still lives, though her boy, as she yet fondly
calls him, has been lying for twelve long years in the chapel of
the old castle. They were Scotch of the Scotch.
I looked at Dacre, his eyes met mine, and each felt conscious
of something withheld from the others. Then he linked his arm
in mine and we went up the long aisle towards the communion-table.
"What is it?" I asked.
"The place is haunted. Do you see nothing?"
I shook my head.
"Look," pointing down the aisle we had just traversed. Whether
that interlacing of arms in some way communicated his power for
the moment, certain it is that I plainly saw the outlines of a shadowy
form, whilst a hand appeared to hover over the heads of the two
who were standing in the aisle. The other hand pointed towards us.
"It is intended for me, not for you," said Sir John; "I noticed
it when we all stood together, and the hand carefully avoided
you."
" But what does it mean ?
" And even as I spoke the ghostly
apparition, or whatever you may choose to call it, seemed to slowly
fade from sight.
" It means death —a warning ; call it what you will. Not
necessarily immediate ; in fact I should say some years will first
pass : but we shall all three die young, and all within a short
time of each other. I shall be the first to go, for the hand first
came to me ; but the others will not tarry long."
He spoke calmly as though making the most common-place remark,
but it was assumed; in reality I saw that he was much moved. . . .
Some years went on, and then, as he had predicted and in the
order indicated, came the end.
You ask what the ghost was like ? I can hardly tell you, it
was so shadowy and insubstantial. The most visible part was the
hand that seemed to float over their heads and the finger that
pointed.
Mr. Wood informs the Editor of the Journal that this incident
took place between twenty and thirty years ago, and that he
had not heard of any apparition having been seen there since
(except the case above recorded). In regard to the question
Apkil, 1909. "Spirit Hands," Suggestion and Dogs. 69
whether his own experience had been published elsewhere, he
writes that his Nonuegian By-ivays first appeared in the Argosy
Magazine, but that he feels sure the story has not been mentioned
in any guide-book.
Miss Grieve writes :
" I am quite certain there was no
reference whatever [to the story] in Baedeker, which was the
only guide-book we had." It is, of course, possible that at
some previous time she had seen or heard of Mr. Wood's
account and completely forgotten it, in which case the apparition
would represent a revived subliminal memory. But her account
shows that, if this was so, it had been so completely forgotten
that she was not reminded of it again, either by seeing the
apparition or by reading the book.
Mr. Wood has informed me that, as is obvious, Dacre was
not the name of his friend : the Dacres held the Southern
Border against the Scots. Miss Grieve gave me the name and
address, recorded in the hotel book, of the Irish tourist whom
the hand followed. I may add that she is not in the way of
seeing uncanny things ; the only two instances are the hand
and the phantasm of a friend, viewed by herself and her dog,
a much respected Dandy Dinmont terrier, on August 6, 1906
(see Journal, February, 1907, pp. 27-30).
In that case Miss Grieve, on the top of Skelfhill, in Teviot-
dale, saw a friend, a lady, whose dress she minutely describes
but the friend was in Cornwall. " I was so surprised that I
did not say anything for a second or two, till the dog began
to growl." Miss Grieve pursued the appearance, and " Turk
barked and growled the whole time, but kept close to my
heels and would not run out as he usually does at strange
people or strange dogs. His hair was all on end, and his tail
hooked over his back as stiff as a poker. . . . Had it not
been for Turk I would have doubted my senses ; but he was
so unmistakably disturbed and angry." The lady seen was
actually wearing the costume described by Miss Grieve, plus
a wet bathing gown on her arm, and was walking down a
hill at Tintagel.
If there was suggestion here, did it come from Miss
Grieve's momentary surprise ? Turk began to growl before
Miss Grieve called to her friend by her name, " Dr. H."
Could Miss Grieve's moment of surprise suggest to Turk that
70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1909.
he had better bristle, growl, and keep in to heel, while Miss
Grieve walked downhill after the appearance ?
Can anybody seriously believe all that ? Turk, probably,
had often seen Miss Grieve silent " for a second or two," and
that was all the suggestion that she gave, and Turk growled,
as she informed me at the time, before she spoke. Nothing
that Turk could do was apt to suggest the presence of her
friend to Miss Grieve.
If suggestion did not affect either Turk or Miss Grieve,
something of unknown nature was there which affected Miss
Grieve, and, in his doggish way, affected Turk. In my neo-
lithic metaphysics, that sometliing was the stufl' that " spirit
hands " ai-e made of.
At Mr. Home's s4ances people expected to see them ; not so
at Eerrick about 1695, in the case so well observed and
recorded by the Kev. Alexander Telfer. There a small
unattached white hand was a phenomenon of the poltergeist
case, and I remember none previous, except in the Book of
Daniel
[G. 286.] Here is another case of a dog sharing an experi-
ence, given in the letters of the percipient to me
22 York M.ansions, Battersea Park, S.W.,
February IWi, 1909.
Dear Sir, —In your Morning Post article to-day you mention a
case of an apparition appearing to a lady and a dog simultaneously.
It may interest you to hear that I and my dog had a like experience
about six years ago. We were sitting in a loom by a fire, with the
door shut ; I reading, the dog sleeping on the floor. I was roused
from my book by the dog—Dan's—growling, and stooped to talk to
him and console him ; and while stroking him, as he continued to
growl, I followed the direction of his gaze with mine (I had to turn
in my chair to do so), and saw to my astonishment a figure in a
grey gown by the door, its face hidden from me by a plant which
stood between us on a table. In my surprise I took it to be my
sister, and addressed it, asking how she had returned so quickly
and quietly. Then, recollecting that I was alone in the house and
the outer doors locked, I got up hastily and Dan sprang towards
the figure, which disappeared, the door remaining shut. The dog
showed every symptom of fear and anger—lowered head, glaring
eyes, hair erect all down his spine. He was evidently convinced
April, 1909. " Spirit Hands," Suggestion and Dogs. 71
that some one was there, for on my opening the door of the room
he tore out barking and rushed up and down stairs in a vain chase
after the visitor, whom I need not say we failed to find. The house
was empty, and I was quite glad a little later to hear the bell ring
and to let my sister in. I have no theories on the subject, nor can
I in any way connect the appearance of my strange visitor with
anything that happened before or since. But I am absolutely certain
that Dan and I did see something, though I can bring no other
witnesses to speak for us.
(Mks.) Emma L. Darton.
Mrs. Darton writes further :
ii2 York Mansions, Battersea Park, S.W.,
Fehruary 23rd, 1909.
Dear Sir, —I am very glad to give the particulars for which you
ask. (a) There were no servants in the house at the time, nor
would it have been possible for any pei'son to have escaped our
notice, as Dan and I were in the passage outside the door (which
was shut until I opened it) within a moment of the figure's dis-
appearance. The room is on the first floor, (b) The house is in a
country village, and stands about 15 yards from the village street
in its own garden, (c) This is my only experience of an apparition,
though I have, as I suppose most people have, had sensations
implying the presence of the unseen.
I might add that the house is one in which the sound of a
person moving is very audible, and footsteps coming along this
particular passage are always heard in the room and on the floors
above and below.
I do not feel certain that any of my relations in the present
generation have had any experiences of the kind, but my grand
father, Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, the novelist, used to assert that
he saw this sort of thing constantly.
Emma L. Darton.
F.S. —I told my sister of the appearance on her return.
In this case I surmise that the figure in grey was what
the Eev. Robert Kirke (ob. 1692) calls the co-walker of the
percipient's sister. It was " an arrival case " ; the lady was on
her way home. Such cases are very common ; the Scandi-
navians have a special name for them. As to suggestion, why
should the growling of the dog, who would not growl at his
72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1909.
familiar friend, make Mrs. Dartoii see a lady in grey ? Some-
thing was there, something invaded the house, as something
invaded the bracken and grass of Skelfhill. Perhaps Mr.
Myers's term, psychorrhagy, is the right word to use in such
cases. I have a third case, a precise parallel to the second
(bar the absent sister). The percipient was an eminent
painter, an intimate friend of mine, and the dog began it.
But my friend knew that the figure in grey had once been
seen by his wife in the room where he sat. He has had no
other visual hallucination, but you may invoke suggestion, as
the appearance had once been seen before, and a lot of
poltergeist was about.

The following account of a dream that occurred on December
29th, 1908, about twenty-four hours after the Messina earth-

I enclose my sister's account of her dream. It is almost exactly
what she wrote to me the same morning.
Alice M. Aitken.
The letter enclosed was as follows
NiSBET, Duns, N.B.,
January 30ih, 1909.
I dreamt I was sitting at a breakfast table in a room all painted
white ;
facing the chimney piece at each end of the table were
Major and Mrs. ; at the end of the room were two deep'
high windows looking upon a harbour. Suddenly the room began
to rock ; the pictures swung out from the walls, and the ornaments
on the chimney-piece rattled. I said to Major : " Do you
think this is an earthquake ? " and he answered :
" It looks uncom-
monly like it." Then suddenly the whole room seemed to rise up
towards me ;
my two companions were turned over, chairs and all,
and the whole of the breakfast things shot into my lap. I got out
of the house and saw the sea in the harbour was very rough and
a lot of ships rolling and pitching, and then there was another
April, 1909. Cases. 73
violent shock and I woke up. I don't think I was frightened, but
my heart was shaking, and I felt very sick, as if I had just come
off a rough sea.
I woke my husband and told him what a vivid dream I had
had of [an] earthquake ; then I heard the clock in my room strike 5.
That morning I saw in the newspapers that there had been a.
bad earthquake in Calabria, but there were no details to hand.
Adeline Aitken.
Mr. Aitken writes
NisBET, Duns, N.B.,
January 30th, 1909.
My wife woke me in the early morning saying that she hadl
dreamt that she had been in an earthquake, gave me the outlines
of her story contained in her statement. At breakfast, when opening
morning papers, there was a report of an earthquake having taken,
place in Sicily.
J. C. Aitken.
In answer to our enquiries Mr. Lang wrote
Alleyne House,
St. Andrews, Scotland, Feb. &h [1909].
. . . The first news of the earthquake reached Mrs. Aitken (Miss.
Aitken's sister-in-law) with the morning paper, probably the Scotsman,
at breakfast, after a dream which was before 5 a.m.
It was, I think, about three weeks ago that Miss Aitken told
me of her sister-in-law's letter. She wanted to know if the tremor-
could have been the cause of the dream. . . . The letter to Miss
Aitken was written after the arrival of the newspaper on the sam&
day. . . .
A. Lang.
Feb. 8th, 1909.
I saw Miss Alice Aitken and her mother yesterday. The dream
was at the address on the letter of the sister-in-law, which you
have. They get the Scotsman about 10 a.m., and the Scotsman of
Dec. 29 would contain the first sketchy news of the earthquake,
unless it had reached the dreamer from an evening paper of Dec. 28.
She is not aware of having heard of any earthquake till she got the
Scotsman about 10 a.m. on Dec. 29. . . . The earthquake was at
5.20 a.m. on Dec. 28. The news, therefore, could not appear in a
morning paper of that day, but there may have been a second
edition out about 8 a.m. ... It seems certain that the dream was
74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apkil, 1909.
on the day after the earthquake, that is, was [at] 5 a.m., Dec. 29,
so it resembles dreams and crystal-gazings containing the contents
of letters just about to arrive. . . . Miss Aitken thinks that
in the torn-up letter to her of Dec. 29 the view of the harbour was not
mentioned. ...
Mrs. Aitken, senior, remembers reading the letter of Dec. 29.
It was torn up because the dreamer and Miss Aitken are in constant
correspondence, and [the latter], at least, does not keep the letters.
The dreamer is coming here this week and I expect to meet her.
A. Lang.
After this meeting, Mr. Lang wrote again
Feb. VMh [1909].
The dreamer saw no evening paper of December 29 [28], and knew
nobody in Sicily or Calabria. She says that she wrote very briefly
on Dec. 29 to Miss Aitken on the dream, the hour of it, and the
tea-cups falling over on her when her chair was upset. Miss Aitken
gives this account of the letter of Dec. 29. . . .
A. Lang.
The earthquake was reported in the evening papers of
December 28th, 1908 ; but we have ascertained that there
was no mention of it in any edition of the Scoisman of that
•date.
In regard to the question whether any tremors had been
felt in Scotland on the morning of December 29th, which
might possibly have had some influence in causing the dream,
we have received the following letter from the Eoyal Observatory,
Edinburgh :
.March 2ncl, 1909.
I am desired by the Astronomer Royal for Scotland to say in
repl}' to your letter of Feb. 2.3, that we have no information as to
any earthcjuake tremors having been felt in the south of Scotland
on the nights of Dec. 28, 29, 1908, nor is there any mention of
tremors happening on these nights in the columns of the Scotsman
newspaper. I may remind you, however, that the great Messina
-earthquake happened on the morning of Dec. 28, and tremors
resulting from it were recorded from 4 h. 16 m. to 6 h. 14 m. of
that morning on the seismograph of this Observatory, the maximum
being at 4.37.

Apeil, 1909. Cases. 75
L. 1175. Dream.
The following case was sent to us by Major-General Charles
H. Owen, of Hanley, Camberley, Surrey, whose daughter, Mrs.
Comyn, had a vivid dream of her mother a few hours before
the latter's death, which, as stated in the Times of October
14th, 1908, occurred on October 11th. Mrs. Comyn's account,
extracted from a letter dated November l7th, 1908, is as
follows :
I will write out exactly what appeared to me, but I cannot say
whether I was asleep or dozing, but all was quite clear to me at
the time. On Saturday night I went to bed, the 10th ; first about
4.30 I was awakened by three distinct scratchings on the door,
which were also heard by the servants in their room at the top of
the house. I then dozed off, and whether really asleep I cannot
say, but there appeared to me my mother, looking very young,
not more than 18 or 19. She was very pretty, lovely pink and white
face, round beautiful eyes, also a great deal of brown hair ; she
was dancing about, when suddenly I heard singing, which seemed
to come closer and closer, as if hundreds of voices (women's voices).
My mother was there, and these voices sang and sang, at last so
loudl}', and seemed so powerful, that I then awoke, feeling my head
in a whirl with the deafening voices ;
my ears sang from the effect,
and I felt very ill. I fancy this was between 5.30 and 6.30 a.m.
on the morning oi the 11th. It must have been her soul soaring
upwards, and she disappeared from sight.
Mrs. Comyn adds on November 23rd, 1908 :
When I saw my vision I heard the music distinctly coming nearer
and nearer to my mother, and when it came closer she disappeared
into the midst of these voices. She did not smile at me, but was
smiling all the time in my dream. The singing was like that of
angels, but I did not see the angels ; but she went up with the
voices, it seemed like amongst angels.
(Signed) SoPHXA A. CoMYN.
Mrs. Comyn's statement was corroborated by her husband
as follows
EoYAL Albert Yacht Club,
SouTHSEA, Janmrij I9th, 1909.
On awakening about 7 a.m. my wife informed me that she had
heard during the night distinct sounds like scratching at our door :
that she then dozed again, and whether asleep or awake she knows
76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1909.
not, but heard the sound of many sweet and high voices quickly
increasing in volume. She now perceived the presence of her
mother, looking young as a girl, fair and pleasant. Her mother did
not look at her, but disappeared as the voices became lost.
My wife became very apprehensive, knowing of her mother's
illness. Next morning at breakfast she ate nothing, and on a
telegraph boy's arrival told me to open the message. I did so, and
read the sad death of Mrs. Owen. The servants told me later that
they had heard the scratching, but had seen nothing, and heard
nothing more.
J. Sarsfield Comyn,
Dep. Surgeon-General A. M.S.
Dr. Comyn adds later :
Fehj. Qih, 1909.
My wife told me of her vision on Sunday morning, and the
telegram from her father arrived at breakfast time the same day.
I opened it at her request, she being then under the gravest appre-
hension regarding her mother.
J. Sarsfield Comyn. -
P.S. —The vision was about 5.30 on Sunday morning.
General Owen, in sending the account, states that the shock
so prostrated Mrs. Comyn that she could not attend the
funeral, and adds :
The description she here gives of her mother corresponds exactly
with what she was when young. Her mother had a beautiful
complexion, and large lovelj' eyes with deep soft expression, and
brown hair—plentiful then, although thin of late. The time of
the vision was that of the last fatal attack, which lasted from
about 6 to 8 a.m., and she was all this time quite insensible. Mrs.
Owen had a strong idea that human beings had guardian angels
watching over and assisting them in dangers and troubles, and
always had a cast of a guardian angel hung above her bed. Although
Mrs. Owen had been ill for a couple of weeks, neither I nor the
nurse attending her, nor, I think, the doctor, thought she was going
to die until an hour before the end ; the doctor had declared she
was better the day before. Mrs. Comyn had no reason to think so,
as the accounts she had received were favourable.
Charles H. Owen.
In regard to the question of how much anxiety existed as
to Mrs. Owen's illness, General Owen kindly procured for us
April, 1909. Cases. 77
a medical statement from the doctor who attended her, and
himself wrote on January 22nd, 1909 :
, . . No one thought she was going to die, and Mrs. Comyu
had received m}" report that she was better. The vision frightened
her, and caused her to fear the arrival of the wire received.
The illness commenced with an attack of headache and sickness,
and she had several other slighter ones, but was apparently getting
over them. . . .

COEKESPONDEXCE.
The following letter, referring to Mrs. Sidgwick's review (pub-
lished in Proceedings, Part LVI.) of Professor jMorselli's book
on Eusapia Paladino, has been addressed to her by Professor
Eichet.
Chere Madame Sidgwick, —J'ai lu avec un vif interet ce cjue vous
dites des experiences —deja bien anciennes —d'Eusapia P. a I'lle
Eoubaud et a Carc^ueiranne, et tout ce que vous dites est parfaite-
ment exact.
Me permettez-vous d'ajouter un fait de detail a ces experiences,
et sur ce point mon souvenir est tres precis. Quand les objets
etaient fortement deplaces autour, et cj[u'il y avait des attouchements
repetes, vous teniez la main gauche et le Dr. Segard tenait la main
droite. Toute la question etait done de savoir si Segard tenait bien
la main droite. Yous le lui demandiez .sans cesse, et il repondait,
"Je tiens la main droite."' Alors, persuade de I'importance fonda-
mentale de cette constatation, je lui ai dit (et meme je I'ai repete),
" Prends garde, si tu te trompes, en affirmant ainsi que tu tiens la
main droite, cest plus qu/une erreur ; cest de la complicife / " En effet
il me parait important d'etablir aujourd'hui, apres quinze ans passes,
que nous n'avons, ni les uns ni les autres, passe legerement sur ce
phenomene de la main bien tenue par Segard.
Voici, chere Madame Sidgwick, le seul point a ajouter a votre
excellente notice de E. Morselli.
Je profite de cette occasion, chere Madame, pour vous assurer de
mes sentiments de tres profonde et respectueuse gratitude.

New Light on Immortality. By E. E, Fournib;r D'Albe. Longmans,
Green and Co. London, 1908. 334 pp. 6/- net.
The title-page of this book, with its description of the author as Hon.
Secretary of the Dublin Section of the Society for Psychical Research,
is somewhat misleading. It led us to look first for a discussion of
the I'ecent investigations conducted by the S.P.R. into the problem
of survival. We found these just referred to, but not discussed, in
a passage at the close of the book. For the rest, the phenomena
of the type dealt with by the S.P.K. —referred to as evidence support-
ing the theories advanced in the book, date for the most part from
a period of over thirty years ago. These phenomena, curious and
puzzling as some of them are, can hardly be made to shed " New
Light on Immortality " unless they are carefully discussed from the
point of view of some new theory.
Such a discussion is not seriously attempted by our author. For
the most part he contents himself with quoting a miscellaneous
selection of extracts of very diverse values from the writings of
others on these subjects. He merely uses the alleged facts as
illustrations of his theories, and makes no attempt to criticise the
evidence on which his facts rest. He seems equally willing to ex-
plain a rap as produced by supernormal as by normal means, and
appears indeed to have a bias towards the supernormal explanation.
For he mentions raps obtained in the presence of Miss Kate Fox
in the text of his book, while he relegates her " confession " of
fraud, with a caution against its too ready acceptance, to a footnote.
No trace is shown of any feeling that a very careful scrutiny of
the evidence for so-called supernormal phenomena is not only
justifiable but necessary before these phenomena can be urged in
support of any theory. We are free to confess that the effect upon
us of reading the third part of the book, in which psychical matters
are chiefly referred to, was a distinct weakening of the effect of
the first two parts, in which the peculiar theories of the book are
developed. For a theory that can be made to explain " the alleged
'
exposures ' of honest mediums " by the recombination of two forms
and by the non-dematerialisation of drapery is apt to repel the
serious investigator of matters psychical. It would, however', be a
pity if the unsatisfactory nature of Part III. prevented readers from
taking up the book at all. For Mr. Fournier D'Albe's speculations
make very interesting reading. So long as they are regarded meiely
as speculations and nothing more, little can be urged against them
in the way of criticism. The idea that the soul may consist of
some lO^s psychomeres, which pass out of the body at the time of
death and float together to some higher stratum of the atmosphere,
is harmless as a hypothesis and leads to a good deal of interesting
theorising and to some clever pieces of writing on the part of the
April, 1909. Review. 79
author. But it does not, so far as we can see from the book, find
positive support in any known physical or physiological facts, while
it fails to give any adec[uate explanation of the very uncertain
phenomena urged in its support.
In fact the sole support of all the theories in the book—and
these theories are claimed to give "New Light on Immortality"
lies in ignorance rather than in knowledge. Now ignorance may
fairly be allowed to open the door to speculations outside the
pale of scientific orthodoxy, but it is not a safe key wherewith to
unlock the inner chambers of truth. Some such attempt has been
made with it by our author. Starting from the fact that we know
very little of the behaviour of individual atoms of matter, and still
less of the meaning of the reactions of inorganic and organic
chemistry, he deduces the conclusion that a materialistic hypothesis
based upon a mechanical view of life has but a weak foundation.
But he is not content with this, and proceeds to construct a rival
hypothesis.
His own scheme of nature is essentially this Life and freedom for
the individual hold right down the scale from man to atom, and
probably further. Our so-called natural laws apply only to aggregates
of individuals, and correspond to the social laws governing the be-
haviour of masses of men. Much is said by way of analogy in support
of this idea. From the nature of the case little can be said by way of
proof. But the conclusions derived from this hypothesis are freely
scattered throughout the book in such a form that the ordinary reader
might easily take them for statements of scientific fact. There is a
serious danger for the general public in such treatment as this.
A parade of scientific knowledge, in the absence of any careful
discrimination between the purely speculative parts of a theory and
those which are experimentally demonstrable, is apt to mislead the
non-scientitic reader, and we should wish to record a most emphatic
protest against some of the expressions in the book. The list of
conclusions given in the last chapter, unaccompanied as it is by
certain very necessary cpialifications, is a sample of the statements
to which we think strong objection should be taken.
The book has been put forward in the hope that it may provide the
basis of a working hypothesis of a future life which may be accepted
by scientists and theologians alike. Like so many eirenicons, we fear
that it is likely to be rejected by both sides. Few scientists
will have the patience to read it through, and those who do so will
pnjbably remain unconvinced. Few theologians will find it possible
either to fit its conclusions into their present theories or to build up
on its basis truer and deeper views of the universe. The book seems
to fail wherever it aims at the serious discussion or solution of difficult
problems. If it could be reissued as a series of delightful speculations
with no claim to a true scientific character, we would gladly welcome
it. As it is, since the writer has in all seriousness attacked a most
difficult problem, it seems necessary to point out the fundamental
defects in his attempted solution of it.

NOTES ON CURRENT PERIODICALS.
In the February-March, 1909, number of Tlie Journal of Abnormal
Psyclwloriy, Dr. Morton Prince continues his monograph on The
Unconscious. By the unconscious he means the neural dispositions
which persist as the pliysiological residua of conscious experiences.
Under certain conditions the ideas making up an experience tend
to become organised into a system or complex, and when the
experience is past, tlie mental complex is said to become dormant
and the correlated nervous complex unconscious. The subsequent
functioning of such dormant complexes is part of the ordinary
mechanism of memory. But if the complex becomes dissociated so
that it cannot be synthetised with the main stream of consciousness,
its functioning gives rise to the phenomenon of co-consciousness
(usually called sub-consciousness). In certain psychological states it
is a question whether we have to do with a physiological complex
without consciousness, or with a co-conscious complex.
W. D. Scott defends the thesis that the psycho-analj' tic method
of Breuer and Freud (see Human Personalitij, Vol. I., p. 50) is nothing
more than an unusually skilful application of the method of
suggestion, and that it offers no proof for the existence of sub-
conscious complexes of suppressed emotional ideas.
An abstract is given of a case of suicide prevented by a hallucina-
tion wliich was lecorded by Th. Flourno)' in the Archives de Psychologic,
Vol. VIL, No. 26, Oct., 1907.
In the Bevue de VHypnotisine, of February, 1909, there is a short
note on some experiments in thought-reading which took place at
a meeting of the Societe d'hypnologie. It seemed plain to the
members that there was in this case no true thought-reading, but
merely muscle-reading of the Cumberland type.
Dr. Paul Farez exposes the mystery of the Mexican "jumping
beans," whose movements have been believed by some people to be
produced by an effort of will on the part of the exhibitor. Each
of these beans {Sehastiania palmeri) contains one or more larvae
{Glaeocapsa saUitans) which, having eaten all the soft interior of the
bean, remain imprisoned bj' the thin hard shell. It is the move-
ments of the larvae which cause the bean to "jump."
Professor Benedikt of Vienna contests the conclusion of Peterson
and Kennelly {N.Y. Med. Jour., 1892) that the physiological and
therapeutical action of magnets, described by Charcot, Benedikt, and
Hammond, is due to suggestion. He gives some instances from his
own experience, in which he claims, on what appears to us insufficient
grounds, that the possibility of suggestion was excluded.

The President's Introductory Note to the forthcoming Eeport
on Sittings with Eusapia Palladino was read, and after discussion
and amendment, approved of.
On the President's proposal, seconded by Mr. Piddington, a
vote of thanks was passed to Mr. G. B. Dorr for the work he
has been doing for the Society with Mrs. Piper, and the great
trouble he has taken in the matter.
A letter was read from Mr. Frank Podmore resigning his
seat on the Council. The Council commissioned the Hon.
Secretary to convey to him their cordial recognition of his
great services to the Society and their deep regret at his
withdrawal.
Permission was given to Mr. Podmore to make use of some
cases in the Proceedings and Journal for a book on psychical
research on which he is now engaged.
The Council filled the vacant place among their elected
Members by appointing to it Dr. P. C. S. Schiller, hitherto a
co-opted member.
PPJVATE MEETING FOPt MEMBEES AND ASSOCIATES.
The 26th Private Meeting of the Society for Members and
Associates only was held in the large Hall at 20 Hanover Square,
London, W., on Tuesday, March 30th, 1909, at 4 p.m.; the
President, Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, in the chair.
Miss Alice Johnson read a paper on " Some Incidents in
the Script of Mrs. Holland," which it is hoped will appear later
in the Proceedings.
MENTAL TYPES: A SUGGESTION FOE EXPEEIMENTS.
By Edward Bullough.
The following method of experimenting, with a view to estab-
lishing the personal identity of " controls," occurred to me a
little while ago as offering perhaps a novel chain of problems
of relatively easy access.
Hitherto the proofs of such identity have been attempted
by showing that the contents of manifestations or communica-
tions, the jmrjm't of messages from the controls, correspond to
or are identical with the experience (memories, associations,
May, 1909. Mental Types : A Suggestion for Experiments. 85
etc.), which the deceased and " controlling " personality was
known to have possessed. Such a line of testing is indeed
the most natural, and the advantage of such a " proof by
content " is unquestionably its relatively objective validity. It
furthermore appears that to those who personally knew the
deceased, the communications seemed in many cases also
strikingly characteristic of the person, not in respect to their
content, but by reason of the particular form which the message
took. Thus an acquaintance of the late Mr. X, might feel
with regard to a certain communication: "This is just how X.
would have put it " ; the convincing point being not so much
I'jhat was said, but hoiv it was said. The " life-likeness " of
communications which is bound to carry much conviction with
those to whom they are addressed is obviously founded largely
upon this characteristic form of the messages. At the same
time it is evident that such a formal similarity between the
turn of phrase of the message and the turn of mind of the
deceased can only be of definite value to the person who
enjoyed his acquaintance, and would carry little weight beyond
being " subjectively convincing "—if I may say so—in that
sense.
Now the point of my suggestion lies in the fact that the
method proposed would from this side—the side of form—too
be capable of yielding objectively valid results, accessible to
closer and more precise study than so-called " characteristic
expressions " usually are : and that, combined with " proofs by
content," they might form a valuable reinforcement of the
latter. Even if found useless from this point of view, experi-
ments on these lines might help to cast a little light upon
the unknown conditions of communication, created by the co-
operation, and probable interference, of a second—the medium's
—mind.
The suggestion is based upon the assumption that it is not
merely in respect of the content or matter of experience and
its elaboration that one mind differs from another, but that
persons differ also, and more fundamentally, by reason of the
particular type of mind which they severally possess, and which
in its turn determines only secondarily the selection and
utilisation of experience at large. Thus two persons might,
even with complete identity of experience (of course, an impos-
86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1909.
sible case), yet differ in the forvi of their mentality. This in its
wider sense is self-evident ;
every one recognises at once that
the late F. W. H. Myers was of a cast of mind different from
the late Edmund Gurney or the late Dr. Hodgson ; but in this
general sense this fact could not be subjected to experimentation
or tests. It would be necessary to select less vague and more
hidden peculiarities of the mind, peculiarities less likely to
draw attention to themselves, and therefore less exposed to
imitation (by the medium's subliminal mind or secondary per-
sonalities), in order to obtain definite data for comparison.
The peculiarities I have in view are those differences which
are known to exist between certain types of mind, described
as " visual," " auditive," " motor," etc., types, with their sub-
divisions or modifications, each possessing its own kind of
" imagery," memory and associations, organised upon the basis
of its particular type. Although the majority of people are of
a mixed type, relatively pure examples are by no means
infrequent, and can easily be detected by means of a few test-
questions. Let us assume that a representative of the auditive
type tries to communicate to another, say the meeting with
a person, unknown to the latter : the question, what was he
like ? would meet with little response ; the answer would
probably be : he has a very agreeable voice and said . . .
of the external appearance nothing, except generalities, would
be remembered ;
nothing of those minor details which alone stamp
a person's appearance as characteristic of him and him alone. On
the other hand, it would be manifestly useless to ask a " visual
for a description of an auditive impression, as I know from per-
sonal experience. There is nothing more difficult for me than to
describe, for instance, a concert, as, in spite of the momentary
enjoyment of the music, I cannot remember the music itself,
though I may vaguely recall specially striking passages, by
means of motor-images. Even within the visual sphere, my
colour-memory is less reliable than my linear-memory, and I
usually notice the outlines of objects more easily than their
colouring. Thus for each individual type the differences can
be refined beyond the main distinctions.
Such peculiarities, if at all pronounced, generally lead to
the working of the whole mental apparatus on the lines of
the special tendencies. " Visuals " organise their present ex-
May, 1909. Mental Types: A Suggestion for Experiments. 87
periences as well as their memory of past ones on a visual,
" auditives " on an auditive basis, etc., and can communicate
experiences only in terms of their particular imagery.
These considerations may suggest the following possibilities
(1) Differences of type may constitute a special difficulty to
telepathic communication. As I have personally no experience
whatever, I must appeal to the experience of others, who may
prove this to be a merely imaginary obstacle. Is it possible
to communicate to a " non-visual " the visual image of an
object, say a cross ? can you convey to him the image " + " or
only the word-image " cross," or the motor-image " x " or the
general idea " cross " ? If " cross " is conveyed at all, how has
it been transferred to him ? This, it seems to me, would be a
case in which the interference of the second mind might be
experimentally tested.
There is undoubtedly the difficulty that telepathic " experi-
ments " of a complicated nature are at present not yet sufficiently
developed to allow of tests of this kind. It might, however,
be a step towards approaching them from the experimental side,
to apply the test to cases of elementary thought-transference, such
as were undertaken by the Society some years ago. Might
not, even in such elementary attempts to transfer an idea or
image, instances of failure be due to some extent to incompati-
bility of mental type ? Among the few successful telepathic
experiments of a complex kind, those of the Misses Miles and
Eamsden could perhaps prove of the greatest value. In what
form of imagery do they attempt to convey or receive their
transmitted thoughts ? To what degree is there any original
agreement of mental type between them ?
(2) A complication might arise from the fact that, as it
seems, the missing types of imagery of the waking-state are
regained in dream-states. At least in the " hypnagogic " con-
dition, non-visuals recover their visualising power and visual
imagery. Does the subliminal consciousness always retain its
imagery complete, while only the supraliminal consciousness
represents a special type ? Yet, as I believe Miss Goodrich-
Freer pointed out, visualising power is essential for crystal-
gazing. What conditions prevail in trance-states ? Ketention
of the ordinary type or recovery of missing imagery ?
(3) The application of these ideas to the messages purporting
88 Journal of Society for Psychical Researclt. May, 1909.
to come from the dead is obvious. The agreement or disagree-
ment of the terms of a communication with the known imagery
possessed by its " control " during his terrestrial existence might
be of considerable value, especially if by means of numerous
preliminary experiments with living subjects the positive im-
portance of such an agreement could be shown. If it were
objected that the conditions after death could hardly be brought
into comparison with life here, as regards mental imagery,^ it
could be urged in return that, since a certain mind on this
side was of a certain type, this mind's memory could, in the
beyond, scarcely be changed in respect to terrestrial experiences
which were all organised on the lines of this particular type,
which only existed for him, so to speak, in terms of this type
and could not well be communicated in any other terms. It
would, for the same reason, appear unreasonable to expect from
a " non-visual," for instance, information, intended for purposes
of identification, which could only be given in visual terms.
That there must have been in some measure obstacles of this
kind seems to me evident, in the failure, for instance, to
correctly convey test-passages from writings, or the difficulty
experienced by "Hodgson" in communicating the word "Arrow"
{Proceedings S.P,E., Vol. XXII. pp. 77-86).
The ideal problem would be, in the case of an individual of a
clearly-established, pure type, attempting to communicate through
a medium, whose ordinary, as well as trance-imagery (if
necessary ?) is known, to ascertain to what extent these messages
conform to the type previously exhibited by him, or to what
extent deviations from it might be referable to the interferences
of the medium. This latter question could easily be separately
studied by means of telepathic experiments and suggestions with
subjects in the waking state, in trance and uiider hypnosis.
These suggestions are not only intended for the study of the
" controls " now upon the scene, although it would probably be
possible to form a fairly accurate idea of Mr. Myers', Mr.
^ The theoretical objection based upon the presumable physiological connexion
between imagery and certain brain-centres, according to which imagery naturally
ceases with the destruction of the brain at death, is a fundamental difficulty
attaching to all "communications," and need not be specially considered here,
the more so as it can be met by the same explanations which have been advanced
as rendering the facts of communications from surviving personalities possible.
Mat, 1909. Mental Types : A Saggestion for Experiments. 89
Gurney's or Dr. Hodgson's imagery from their writings. In
order to render the proceedings truly experimental and of
" prospective " utility, the experiments ought to iuclude especially
the study of the mental types of living beings, of such, for
instance—if the mention of names may be excused—as Sir Oliver
Lodge, Prof. William James, Mr. Piddington, Mrs. Verrall, etc., as
of persons most likely to figure after their death as " controls."
Whether we regard " communications " from the spiritistic point
of view or explain them by the theory of dramatic impersonations
of the medium's secondary personality, there is in any case a
strong presumption of certain people eventually playing a part in
communications.
Altogether the scope of the experiments is considerably wider
than their application to the present state of the Society's work
only. They would involve experimentation on a large number of
side-issues (as the above-mentioned differences between supra-
and sub-liminal imagery, hypnotic imagery, trance-imagery, inter-
ference by a second person, as a medium or a mere receiver of
transmitted thoughts) and—if the value of imagery as a criterion
could be shown,—the organised registration of living beings,
according to their mental characteristics, for possible reference
after their death.
It seems to me that, even if leading to no positive results,
this line of experimenting might conceivably throw a little
light upon the so far quite unknown conditions of mediumship,
and might possibly—as experiments so often do—direct atten-
tion to other ideas infinitely more valuable than the initial
suggestion.

I-
Themes de Discussion.
Un certain nombre de questions — dont plusieurs nous ont ete
sugger^es du dehors — ont ete raises a Tordre du jour de nos dis-
cussions. Les Rapporteurs qui ont bien voulu se charger de les
introduire devant le Congres ont ^te pries de nous envoyer leurs
rapports le phis vite possible, afin que nous puissions les faire im-
primer et les expedier a toutes les personnes inscrites comme membres
du Congres. Elles pourront ainsi les lire a loisir et preparer leurs
remarques et objections en connaissance de cause. Cela permettra
aux rapporteurs de ne donner a la seance raeme qu'un court resum6
de leur travail, et laissera plus de temps aux discussions, qui seront
d'autant plus nourries et fecondes que les congressistes auront pu y
reflechir a I'avance.
Ces questions sont les suivantes :
A. Questions Generales.
1. Les Sentiments. Eapporteurs : MM. le prof, 0. Kiilpe (Wiirz-
burg) et le Dr. P. Sollier (Paris).
2. Le Suhconsdent. Eapporteurs : MM. les prof. M. Dessoir (Berlin),
P. Janet (Paris) et Morton Prince (Boston).
3. La Mesure de 1' Attention. Eapporteurs : MM. les prof. M. L.
Patrizi (Modene) et Th. Ziehen (Berlin).
4. Psychologie des PMnom^nes religieux. Eapporteurs : MM. les prof.
H. Hoffding (Copenhague) et J. Leuba (Bryn Mawr).
B. Questions Speciales.^
Psycho-Pedagogie :
5. Classification psycho-pddagogique des ArriMs scolaires.- Rappor-
teurs : MM. le Dr. 0. Decroly (Bruxelles), le prof. G. C. Ferrari
(Imola-Bologne), le Dr. Th. Heller (Vienne), le prof L. Witmer
(Philadelphie).
6. La Methodologie de la Psychologie pSdagogique. Eapporteur : Mile,
le Dr. I. loteyko (Bruxelles).
PSYCHO-ZOOLOGIE :
7. Les Tropismes. Eapporteurs : MM. le Dr. G. Bohn (Paris), les
prof. Fr. Darwin (Cambridge), H. S. Jennings (Baltimore) et J. Loeb
(Berkeley).
^D'un int6ret moins general pour I'ensemble des Congressistes qiie les sujets
precedents, ces dernieres questions pourront faire I'objet de seances particu-
lieres paralleles destinees aux personnes qui s'en occupent specialement.
May, 1909. VT"'^ Congres International de Psychologie. 91
8. Lorientation loiniaine. Eapporteur : M. le prof. A. Thauzies,
president de la Federation des Societes colombophiles de I'Ouest-Sud-
Ouest (Perigueux).
Psycho-Physiologie :
9. La perception des Positions et Mouvements de notre corps et de nos
raernhres. Eapporteur : M. le prof. B. Bourdon (Rennes).
II.
Questions d'Uxification.
Toutes les sciences, arrivees a un certain point de leur develop-
pement, necessitent Tetablissement de certaines conventions simpli-
ficatrices en fait de vocabulaire et d'equivalences terminologiques,
de precedes techniques, d'unites de mesure, etc. Les congres inter-
nationaux sont I'occasion la plus propice pour jeter les premieres
bases de ce travail d'entente et pour organiser des commissions
permanentes auxquelles incombera la tache de le mener a bonne fin.
II nous semble que pour la Psychologie aussi le moment est venu
d'entreprendre activement cette ceuvre d'unification, en faveur de
laquelle un vceu avail ete deja emis il y a neuf ans au Congres de
Paris. C'est pourquoi nous inscrivons les quelques articles suivants
au programme de notre reunion de cet ete :
1. Terminologie. — Comme introduction a ce sujet et pour engager
nos coUegues de tons pays a nous apporter leurs idees et leurs
suggestions utiles en ce domaine un pen aride a premiere vue, nous
publierons et leur enverrons au cours de ce printemps un premier
essai ou avant-projet de convention, portant sur un certain nombre
de notions indispensables et d'un emploi constant dans les recherches
de psychologie experimentale.
2. Etalonnage des Couleurs (Standard-Colours). — II serait fort de-
sirable que les divers experimentateurs qui ont a se servir de couleurs
dans leurs investigations puissent les designer d'une facon a la fois
precise, simple et commode, en se referant a une echelle numerotee
suivant les nuances et les degres de saturation, et universellement
admise comme etalon. Xous invitons ceux de nos collegues qui sont
competents dans cette branche, ainsi que les fabricants d'appareils
d'optique ou de papiers de couleur, a nous apporter leurs propositions,
et, eventuellement, des echantillons.
Nous esperons que cette question si importante sera introduite au
Congres par j\I. le prof. W. Nagel (Rostock).
3. Mode de numeration des fautes dans les exp6nences de tdmoignage. —
M. Otto Lipmann, Dr. phil. (Berlin) rapportera.
4. Notation de Vage des enfanis.—Certains auteurs ont I'habitude
92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 1909.
d'indiquer en jours ou en semaines I'age des enfants. Cette notation
est mal commode : on ne voit pas tout de suite quel est I'age qui
correspond au 164"' jour ou a la 89""' semaine. Nous proposerons au
Congres d'adopter le mode de notation recemment employe par Stern.
5. Ddterniination mathdmatique des rcsuUats numiriques des exph'iences.
— Lorsqu'il s'agit de prendre la moyenne d'un grand nombre de
resultats, ou de chercher la correlation de caracteres psychiques ou
autres, de difficiles problemes se posent a I'investigateur. Ces pro-
blemes, cependant, sont de nature trop delicate et speciale pour que
nous ayons demande a des rapporteurs de les introduire devant le
Congres avant de savoir si certains de nos coUegues desirent qu'ils
figurent a I'ordre du jour. Si c'est le eas, nous sommes prets a
organiser une seance speciale qui reunirait les personnes s'interessant
a ces questions de matbematique appliquee.
Les membres du Congres qui desireraient que d'autres objets
d'unification fussent portes a I'ordre du jour sont pries de bien
vouloir nous en aviser au plus tot.
III.
Exposition d'Instruments, Etc.
Toutes les personnes (psychologues, fabricants, etc.) qui auraient
I'intention d'exposer pendant le Congres des instruments, appareils,
livres ou brochures, collections et objets divers concernant les
recherches et I'enseignement de la psychologic, ou de faire des de-
monstrations experimentales, sont priees de nous en donner avis le
plus vite possible, avec toutes les indications necessaires pour que
nous puissions leur reserver I'emplacement qu'elles desirent.
IV.
Communications Individuelles.
Ainsi que nous I'avons indique dans notre premiere circulaire, un
de nos vifs desirs — en tachant de concentrer les efforts des congres
sistes sur les themes de discussion indiques plus haut — serait de
reagir centre cette plethore de communications individuelles dispa-
rates dont les derniers Congres ont tant eu a soulfrir. Cependant,
nous ne nous sentons pas le droit de fermer d'emblee et absolument
la porte aux travaux inedits et particulierement interessants que des
membres croiraient devoir presenter au Congres. C'est pourquoi
nous conservons cette rubrique des Communications individuelles, en
priant leurs auteurs eventuels de bien vouloir nous les annoncer le
plus vite possible (au plus tard avant le 15 juin). L'organisation de
Sections particulieres pour y r6partir ces communications indivi-
Mat, 1909. F/"" Gongres International de Psychologie. 93
duelles ne se fera qu'ulterieurement, selon le nombre et la nature
de celles-ci.
Toutefois, vu les demandes qui nous en ont ete adressees par
plusieurs biologistes, nous institiions des maintenant une Section de
psychologie animale, qui fonctionnera pendant toute ou partie de la
duree du Congres.
Les psycho-zoologistes sont done invites a presenter a cette Section
des communications individuelles, en les accompagnant si possible de
presentations d'animaux.
Communications deja annoncees :

dressage.
Les personnes qui s'interessent au Congres de Psychologie sont
priees de bien vouloir envoyer au plus tot a notre tresorier leur
adhesion accompagnee d'un mandat-postal de 20 fr., en retour duquel
elles recevront une carte de Membre du Congres et toutes les

REVIEW.
Thoughts of a Modern Mystic. A Selection from the Writings of the late
C. C. Blassey. Edited by Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S.
London : Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., Ltd. 1909. Pp.
iv-i-227. 3s. 6d. net.
Professor Barrett has raised a memorial tribute to his friend Mr.
Massey, who was, like himself, one of the founders of the Society
for Psychical Research, but who, in very early days, retired from
it because he was out of sympathy with its demand for scientific
tests for what could be seen, or weighed, or measured, or
recounted in safe human testimony. His method of acquiring
Mat, 1909. Review. 95
knowledge was an inward method, and he applied a life of large
leisure, unfettered by domestic or professional cares, to thinking
and writing on ultimate things.
He lived in chambers in Victoria Street, Westminster, was much
in the Athenaeum Club, and died in 1905 at the age of sixty-seven.
He was, by universal testimony, an attractive personality, an
earnest and fearless thinker, ever engaged in the pursuit of
abstract truth. Indeed, his friend Laurence Oliphant wrote to him
that it would do him good to drop his restless questioning for a
while, and live an outdoor life of physical exercise, inasmuch as
he was like a man whose head was in a hot box and his body
suffering from cold. At one time he thought of joining Laurence
Oliphant at Haifa in Syria. At another he approached the
Catholic Church, but could not join that either; so he remained
ever a hovering inquirer, not easily labelled, except as a spiritualist
who did not value material manifestations, and a theosophist who
did not value Mahatmas.
We must also admit that he is an author whom it is very
difficult to read. He had not the gift of style, and we have
valued the occasional elucidation added by the editor. He coined
a number of new words, which a reader has to learn, such as
"mediated," which means brought into effective action through
some such intervening medium as a Bible story, or a popular
religion :
" factural," which is applied to a truth not in its aspect
as a general truth, but as partially revealed and partially obscured
by some outward fact such as the Eesurrection.
The central idea in his mysticism—if I may dare to attempt a
description of what is so difficult to grasp—is that historical
statements are often crude, unreliable, and likely to be rejected
they are the clothing of a truth behind them. Our author does
not give us many illustrations of his meaning, but an instance of
this would be that whilst the story of the Fall of Man is not
historical, it represents the truth that the absorption of our spirits
in the garment of flesh brings them into sin. To reach some such
generalised truth is, then, the second stage of what is called
"cognition" or "integration." The final stage is to rehabilitate the
original fact in some way which is to be accepted, because it is
found to be the vehicle of general principles—even eternal truth.
It will be seen that this sometimes leaves it difficult for a
reader to know whether the author does, or does not, accept the
ordinary historical facts with which he begins. One feels that
96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 1909.
mysticism of this type ought to be expressed, in order to be clear,
not in the rather brief concentrated style of a conversational
letter, but in carefully worded and expanded paragraphs.
The following passages will give some idea of the author's manner
of treatment.
"Therefore, too, to speak of our nature—the nature of our
present consciousness—as entitled to respect from 'interference,'
is for me a radical nonconception of the religious problem.
Certainly I do not believe in the Gospel narrative [of the Virgin
Birth] as let alone in its crude immediacy as historic fact, but I
conceive in its '
truth,' as having a process of intelligence, which
must go through the negative '
moment ' of denial of fact, but with
the consummate result of a resurrection of the fact as dependent
and consequent on the ideal or eternal truth which is in the
history, and which eventually restores the very history which it
breaks in its own evolution. ". . . .
" It seems to me that if we deny the Virgin birth so explicitly
stated in two of the Gospels, we may as well '
be hanged for a
sheep as a lamb,' and deny the whole historic basis of Christi-
anity —all that realises its idea for us. Doubtless, the true
realisation, the true '
witness,' must be in our own experience—and
I still often doubt. But as often do I recur to my belief in the
'
resurrection '
of the '
fact,' transfigured, surely, eternalised, '
raised
'
to 'truth.'"
It would be impossible to judge a difficult book of this kind by
isolated paragraphs ; the reader has to get into its swing and
acquire such a new vocabulary as indeed is to some extent inevit-
able in mystical researches.

DONATIONS EECEIVED EOE RESEARCH.
We have much pleasure in stating that a donation of £30
has been received from Sir Oliver Lodge towards the expenses
of the sittings with Eusapia Palladino recently held by Mr.
Feilding, Mr. Baggally, and Mr. Carrington at Naples. Another
member of the Society, who wishes to remain anonymous, has
generously contributed £26 5s. for the same purpose.

Associates only was held in the large Hall at 20 Hanover Square,
London, W., on Tuesday, May 18th, 1909, at 4 p.m.; the
President, Mrs. Henry SiDGwacK, in the chair.
Mrs. Verrall read a paper on " A New Group of Automatic
Writers," which it is hoped will appear later in the Proceedings.
CASE.
L. 1176. Veridical Impression.
The following case has been sent to us by Lady Eayleigh
through Mrs. Sidgwick, the account being given in a letter
from the Countess of Leitrim to Lady Eayleigh
Government House, Natal, January 28th, 1909.
Either on Sunday, December SOth, Monday, 21st, or Tuesday, 22nd,
1908, I was conscious of a very definite knowledge that Lord
Eayleigh was seriously ill. I had no dream about him, but so certain
was I of the fact that, on coming on deck directly after breakfast,
I told my mother, Mrs. Henderson. We were then at sea, some-
where near the Equator, on our way to Cape Town.
I had never had a definite impression in that way before, and was
therefore particularly careful to tell my mother at once.

Mrs. Henderson writes to Lady Eayleigh
Government House, Natal, January 2Sth, 1909.
One morning, in the early part of the week beginning the 20th
of December, 1908, my daughter. Lady Leitrim, told me she had a
very strong impression that Lord Eayleigh was ill. She said she
could not understand why it was, as she had had no dream, but she
felt certain that he was very ill.

Lord Rayleigh and I Avent out to Cape Town in November, 1908.
We travelled about a good deal, and on December 15th Lord Ray-
leigh was taken suddenly and violently ill of dysentery, on his way
by Cape cart from Mafeking to Zeerust. He managed to make
the journey to Pretoria next day, and was laid up at Government
House, Pretoria. He was sufficiently recovered to leave his room
for a few hours on December 22nd, and to go downstairs on the
25th. He was able to travel to Johannesburg in a sleeping carriage
on December 28th.
It was quite impossible for Lady Leitrim to have heard of his
illness, as she was on the sea between Madeira and Cape Town at
the time.
She knew he was in S. Africa, and was looking forward to possibly
meeting him there.

REVIEW.
Religion and Medicine : The Moral Control of Nervous Disorders, by Elwood
Worcester, D.D., Ph.D., Samuel M'Comb, M.A. (Oxon.), D.D.
(Glasgow), and LsADOR H. CORIAT, M.D. (London : Kegan Paul,
Trench, Triibner & Co. 1908. Pp. x, 427. Price 6s. net.)
In the introduction to this book we are told that its object is to
describe in plain terms the principles underlying the new medico-
religious effort which goes hy the name of the "Emmanuel movement"
(from the name of the church in Boston where it originated), and the
methods by which these principles are applied. This movement is the
outcome of a conviction on the part of its founders that the Church has
an important mission to discharge to the sick, and that the physician
and the clergyman can work together to the benefit of the community.
Being conversant with the striking results that have been obtained in
the treatment of functional nervous disorders by modern psycho-thera-
peutic methods, and recognizing that many of these disorders are
associated with disturbances of the moral life, they formed the opinion
that therapeutic suggestions cond^ined with spiritual guidance and
prayer would effect for sufferers of this kind more than could be
effected in any other way. But although they thought that the clergy
are by character and training specially qualified to practise treatment
by suggestion, thej^ realized that they might do harm rather than good
if they undertook to treat unsuitable cases. They therefore made it a
June, 1909. Revieiv. 101
rule not to treat any case until a diagnosis of functional nervous
disease had been made hy a competent physician.
The method of treatment employed is that method of modern psycho-
therapy which is known as treatment by suggestion, with or without
hypnosis, and the principles which are said to underlie this form of
treatment are familiar to neurologists who have studied this branch of
therapeutics, although by no means accepted by all of them. There is,
indeed, even in this book, a fundamental difference of opinion between
two of the writers in regard to the psychological status of what they
both refer to as the " subconscious." Dr. Worcester believes that there
is in each of us a subconscious mind which is a normal part of our
spiritual nature, which has more direct control of the physical processes
and is, under certain conditions, more amenable to external control
than our ordinary consciousness. Dr. Coriat takes a totally different
view of the nature of the subconscious. He regards the subconscious
as being always due to a dissociation of consciousness ; and to a sub-
consciousness so originating no peculiar powers can be ascribed. This
opinion regarding the nature of the subconscious is held by the majority
of American neurologists, and although its supporters maintain that the
manifestation of subconscious phenomena is not necessaril}' an indica-
tion of abnormality, it differs very little from the opinion of Professor
Janet, who regards every manifestation of subconsciousness as proof of
pathological dissociation. Its weakness as a hypothesis lies in the
difficulty of applying it to the description or explanation of all the
observed phenomena.
Dr. Coriat's contribution to this book is restricted to a purely
scientific discussion of the main problems of abnormal psychology in
their relation to therapeutics, and he gives no indication that he is
particularly in sympathj- with the views of his clerical collaborators in
regard to the matters which form the distinctive character of the
work. In what follows, reference to the writers of the book applies to
Dr. Worcester and Dr. M'Comb.
The foundation of the belief that the clergy may successfully under-
take the treatment of certain diseases is to be sought in the records of
the results which have been obtained by the use of suggestion as a
therapeutic agent in medical practice; and there is just a suspicion of
arrogance in the attitude of the writers with regard to treatment by
suggestion as used by themselves. They seeiQ inclined to forget that
what they know about it they have learned mainly from the medical
profession. They say that sufferers from functional neuroses are the
despair of the ordinary practitioner and " will continue to be such until
102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1 909
the phj'sician enlarges the sphere of his culture and qualifies himself to
treat the whole man." Phj'sicians may apprehend that moral maladies
require moral treatment, but " on account of their ignorance of psycho-
logical methods few physicians feel themselves competent to undertake
such treatment." Now it may be doubted if the ordinary clergyman
has any greater knowledge of psychological methods than the ordinary
physician, and the sphere of a clergyman's culture makes him no more
qualified than the ordinary practitioner to treat "the whole man."
Although it may be true that the time is coming " when a knowledge
of physiological jjsychology will be considered as necessary to the art of
healing as a knowledge of anatomy," we have no assurance that in the
meantime the clergy as a whole have any such knowledge as would
entitle them to exploit this particular branch of the healing art, or such
qualifications as would justify them in attempting in this matter to
forestall the ordinary practitioner, who finds it increasingly difiicult to
keep abreast of scientific progress in every department of medicine.
If the claim of the Church to cure disease be based on the scientific
attainments of her ministers, there is little to be said in favour of the
contention. But the plea really put forward is something quite different
from this ; and instead of regarding this book as giving merely a
description of the principles and methods of the Emmanuel movement,
we must regard it as an appeal to the Christian Church throughout the
world to return to the faith and the practice of its early days, and in
the fulfilment of its mission to the sick to " outdo the wonders of the
apostolic and the post-apostolic age."
It is maintained that the healing of the sick was an essential part of
Christ's ministry, enjoined on his disciples and practised by the early
Church, and that in so far as the Church of to-day has lost faith in its
healing powers and takes no care for the temporal well-being of its
members, it is failing in its purpose. The thought that lies at the
centre of the Emmanuel movement is that only by a return to a literal
fulfilment of Christ's commands in respect to the curing of disease will
the Church be able to maintain her position in the modern world.
It is the alliance of religion with the practice of theraiseutic sugges
tion that mainly distinguishes this book from ordinary works on
psycho-therapeutics. Besides attaching a religious importance to the
mental states in which suggestion is most effective and believing that
in these states " the Spirit of God enters into us and a power not our
own takes possession of us," the writers also believe in the therapeutic
value of prayer. "The prayer of faith uttered or unexpressed has an
immense influence over the functions of organic life." And this influ-
JCNE, 1909. Review. 103
ence is not merely a result of suggestion, not merely "a beneficial reflex
effect upon the mind of him who prays " or of him who knows that he
is being prayed for. An element of suggestion is tacitly admitted by
the writers, but they believe that there is something more. They say,
" If we grasp the thought that we are organically related to God, that
we exist in Him spiritually somewhat as thoughts exist in the mind,
we can see that a strong desire in our soul communicates itself to Him
and engages His attention just as a thought in our soul engages ours."
Such a prayer " rises in the mind of God, and if it is good becomes one
of His determining motives."
Another reason for combining religion with the practice of thera-
peutic suggestion is to be found in the view which the writers hold as
to the importance of the kind of faith which has power in effecting
curative results. Faith in the physician or in his treatment may be
enough for the cure of an illness, but it is a poor substitute throughout
life for faith in a living God. A suggestion that a tuning fork is a
powerful magnet which relieves pain and cures many diseases may work
well in some cases, but Dr. Worcester says he would "expect no moral
regeneration, no newer and higher life, to proceed from such a source."
Here we see plainly that the aims of the writers are essentially
different from those of the physician. It has been supposed that the
Emmanuel movement was instituted for the purpose of treating certain
diseases, but the object of its founders was manifestly something quite
different. They claim that their work is essentially ethical and spiritual,
and admit that their chief interest in the men and women who seek
their care is a moral and religious interest. To the phj'sician the relief
of sickness is an end ; to the Emmanuelist it is a means of prosely-
tising.
The writers believe that we are living to-day in the midst of a great
religious movement in which the Church has no part. "Everywhere
men and women are feeling and apprehending, however dimly, that the
religion taught and practised by the churches is not the whole religion
of Christ ; hence we see on one side a wholesale defection to strange
cults and institutions which, with all their aberrations, hold up the
promise of immediate help to the whole man, and on the other hand we
observe a growing apathy and indiflference toward the Church." In
the realisation of the declining prestige of the Church and in the belief
that by attending more to man's temporal needs she may hold her own
against aberrant forms of faith, we find the mainsprings of the action
taken by the leaders of the Emmanuel movement. Not the cure of
disease or the relief of suffering is their object, but the saving of souls.
104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1909.
The Christian religion, they saj;^, "despises no undertaking, no matter
how humble, that is intended to benefit man, but its quarry is the soul,
it concerns itself only with great things." The Christian religion is
being defrauded of its legitimate quarr}' because strange cults have
arisen which, instead of " preaching that is vague and impractical and
which deals largely with a distant future " give "the promise of an
immense immediate good as the result of faith." If, then, the Church
would resume her old sway over the hearts of men, let her return to her
early traditions, let her regain the heroism of faith, let her once more
be able to say in the words of her Founder, "Behold I cast out devils
and I do cures."
This desire of devout men once more to make the Practical Motive
the most important motive of religious belief is profoundly interesting.
Men, they say, will believe only what is good and useful to believe.
Yes, but men must believe what is good and useful to believe on the
whole and in the long run. Two great types of religious belief have
arisen in the course of man's moral development, and the transition
from the lower to the higher type has always been characterised by the
projection of the goal of religious thought out of the present into a more
and more remote future. The more highly developed man's religious
consciousness becomes, the more does he realise his relation to the
universal and the infinite, and the more insignificant does every
material interest of the present appear. To make temporal welfare or
well-being a motive for religious belief is to revert to a type of faith
which all the higher religions of the world have already outgrovv^n.
Religious systems based on the promise of material benefits here and now
must die out because they are no longer adapted to the furtherance of
man's destiny, and the introduction of such promises as a motive for
belief into the highest form of religion the world has ever known can
only tend to lower the ideals of believers and pervert their outlook on
the universe.

NOTES ON CUERENT PERIODICALS.
Proceedings of the American S.F.B. Vol. II. Part 3. (December,
1908). The first article in this number is a further record by Mrs.
Lambert of experiments in automatic writing, etc., made by her and
her husband's clerk, Mr. Hannegan, and various other people. Mr.
Hannegan is said to have suddenly discovered in March, 1908,
that he had great mediumistic cajjacity, and a report of some
of his earlier sittings with Mr. and Mrs. Lambert and their
June, 1909. Notes on Current Periodicals. 105
friends during May and June, 1908, was published in the previous
number of the Proceedings.
The phenomena seem to be of the usual spiritualistic type ;
and
a very complete and minute dramatisation of the controls is shown
not only in the automatic writing, but also in the daily lives of
the mediums.
Shorthand notes were made of the sittings, but there are no
signed statements of witnesses published in corroboration of any of
the incidents in the report. Besides the automatic writing, a good
many "physical phenomena" are reported, occurring either in the dark
or when the medium and Mrs. Lambert alone were present. Thus, a
message was asked for from the dead wife of a friend and, after the
lights were lowered, two white roses were laid on the table for this
friend. Mr. Hannegan undertook the position of tutor to Mrs.
Lambert's boy of ten, and on one occasion when they were alone
on the beach together Mr. Hannegan cut his hand. The boy
apparently did not see the blood, but did see a visionary golden
hand clasping Mr. Hannegan's. There are instances of both Mr.
Hannegan and Mrs. Lambert going into trance and mentally
visiting foreign countries and places and seeing on several occasions
the same scenes and people. After one of these incidents, in Avhich
Mr. Hannegan supposed himself to go daily to nurse a wounded
boy, Mrs. Lambert found him in bed in trance with his hands
covered with blood. She saw an apparition in the room at the
time, which she at first thought was Mr. Hannegan himself,,
but judged from his groans that he was really in bed. In the
automatic writing on one occasion reference is made to a particular
desk in Mr. Lambert's office which was subsequently found broken
open. The other phenomena resemble these instances and several
" incidents too personal to quote " are mentioned.
In a lengthy introduction Professor Hyslop points out that the
explanation must lie either in fraud, collective hallucination, or in
an unusual type of physical phenomena. He puts aside the
possibility of fraud and suggests that the "physical phenomena"
may be due to sensory and motor automatisms combined with amnesia,
and that Mrs. Lambert in particular may often go into and recover
from a state of trance without knowing it (which from the account
certainly might be the case) and herself produce the phenomena
automatically.
The second article, "A Record of Dreams, etc.," by Marie Shipley,
gives in detail some fifty-five psychic experiences of Mrs. Shipley,.
106 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1909.
the wife of a bank manager of Columbus, Ohio, most of which
occurred between July, 1907, and September, 1908. Until July,
1907, when she wrote to Professor Hyslop about her experiences,
she had kept no record of them ; after this date she kept a diary,
but even then no records of her experiences were signed or
corroborated until some time after they occurred, and, in most cases,
not until after the fulfilment or coincidence had become known to
her and those about her.
Some of the earlier experiences occurring four or five years before
her record was kept or corroboration obtained seem, as reported,
to be very remarkable, and it is noticeable how much more com-
plete and perfect they appear than those which occurred later and
are more carefully observed and recorded. '
The phenomena consist mainly of " premonitory " dreams, but
there are coincidental dreams and impressions, apparitions of dead
and living persons, supposed communications from the dead, etc.
Of these, premonitory dreams, more or less accurately fulfilled,
constitute nearly half the total number. They take the form of
" dreams " in which Mrs. Shipley sees her friends in varying circum-
stances, sometimes very trivial, but usually serious, as when they
appear to her ill or dying. A curious incident, better corroborated
than most, is . one in which Airs. Shipley, writing to a friend at
a great distance, of whom she had not heard for some months,
mentions that she saw him in a dream, " very plainly yesterday
in a room with a lot of playthings on the floor—children's clothes
and toys." This friend, Mr. Lewis, is a professor of art and
drawing, but on the day on which he received this letter from
Mrs. Shipley (two days after it was written), he had been giving a
demonstration before a kindergarten to oblige the teacher, and had
been making a bird-cage surrounded by the children on the floor.
Another case is one in which she dreamt of a friend's child in
great danger of falling from an open window ; about three weeks
later the child's mother found her sitting on a roof outside the
second-floor window of a shop and was just in time to prevent an
accident. In another case she dreams of the death of a friend to
whom in reality an accident occurred.
One interesting case is the apparition of a dead friend, an old
nurse, who warns her against kidney disease, which she had no
reason to fear at the time. About nine months later she developed
diabetes. This incident is well authenticated, as the account of the
dream was sent to Professor Hyslop as soon as it occurred.
June, 1909. Notes on Current Periodicals. 107
The third article, "A Record of Experience," by G. A. T., consists
of transcriptions from a diary of psychical experiences, kept very
minutely for a period of over a year, together with the writer's
speculations on their nature and meaning. This mass of material
is not classified in any way and even the writer's analysis and
conclusions are interspersed at random in the record, together with
copious extracts from the writings of Myers, Maxwell, and others,
so that it is not easy to estimate the value of the material.
The writer is evidently possessed of some " mediumistic " faculty ;
his experiences are chiefly raps, metallic and other sounds, "touchings,"
•etc., in the room near liim, both when alone or with other people.
Mr. T. is accustomed to regard the raps as a signal to begin auto-
matic writing, which he can usually only obtain after such a signal.
His writings purport to come from dead friends and relations and
appear to be in general quite unevidential, while in nearly all the
instances where they purport to be evidential they are incorrect.
Mr. T. in fact is himself disposed to regard them as the productions
of his own subconscious mind. But he is convinced of the objective
nature of the sounds, raps, etc., which he heard both in his own
house and in his mother's, and which were apparently heard as
much by his mother and relations in his absence as by himself.
On several occasions he noticed that the raps seemed to coincide
with a heart beat, though at irregular intervals, and after careful
attention decided that they practically always did so : on this he
speculates at great length. He is convinced that the raps, etc., are
not hallucinatory, but that they are produced by his subliminal
consciousness "as a sort of motor automatism."
J. R.
The Psychological Review (Baltimore, U.S.A.) for January, 1909, con-
tains an account by Elmer E. Jones, Ph.D., of the gradual disintegration
of consciousness under chloroform, founded on three observations upon
himself. Amongst the noteworthy points are the illusions of the
kintesthetic sense. At an early stage of the experiment it was
noticed that muscular movements appeared to be of much greater
extent than they actually were, and to occupy a much longer
time. Mr. Dunbar's observations on his own experience under
hashish were to a similar effect. The phenomenon may have some
bearing upon the slowness of movement commonly reported in
Poltergeist cases. Of course, in those cases the motions observed
are not in the subject's own organism ; but it should be remembered
108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1909.
that our chief standard for estimating the rate of motion in external
objects is to be found in the movements of our own eye-muscles.
Dr. Jones found that the senses disappeared in the following order
hearing, the tactile sense (followed by the loss of muscular control),
vision : consciousness, memory, and the reasoning faculties remained
for some time, but slightly impaired, after the abolition of all sensation.
The following passage is of interest :
" With the disappearance of
the tactile sense and hearing, the body has completely lost its
orientation. It appears to be nowhere, simply floating in space. It
is a most ecstatic feeling. Consciousness is now almost pure ideas
it is free from any disturbing stimuli from the sense organs, and is
probably just what is meant traditionally by a free spirit."
In the Archives de Psychologie for October and December, 1908,
Mr. Ernest Naville gives an account of numerous visual hallu-
cinations of which he has been the subject. He is now in his ninety-
second year ; in good health ; his eyes are free from organic defect
and serve quite well for the ordinary affairs of life, though he finds
much difliculty in reading or writing.
His hallucinations, of which he first became aware some time in
the course of last summer, are exclusively visual ;
they represent
generally small crowds or processions of human beings, or flocks of
animals, mostly sheep. The figures are perfectly normal in character
and movement ;
indeed, at first he could only recognise them for
hallucinations because others could not see them. They are seen
sometimes as if through the window ; sometimes when the
percipient is himself out of doors. They disappear when the eyes
are closed (he does not say whether they reappear when the
eyes are reopened), but fixing the gaze upon them has no effect—
they usually disappear in a natural manner, by moving out of
sight. On two or three occasions Mr. Naville has attempted to
approach them, but on each occasion they vanished when he came
within a certain distance. In one case the hallucination had its
origin in an illusion—some white stones were transformed into a
flock of sheep, which afterwards multiplied and moved about. In
another case, when, after passing through a muddy place, he saw
some mud on his shoes, though none was really there, the hallu-
cination was apparently due to an immediate provocation from the
surroundings. In most cases, however, Mr. Naville thinks that the
visions are due to memory, with very little admixture of imagin-
ation. A tall building which he has seen on several occasions was
apparently a reminiscence of a similar building seen in Geneva.
June, 1909. Notes on Current Periodicals. 109
In one case he thinks he has traced the haUucination—a vision of
a crowd of women in large white coifs (cornettes) —to an incident
which occurred sixty-two years ago.
In one case oidy have the haUucinations been of a disagreeable
character : they generallj' interest and amuse him. Mr. Naville notes
two points which may throw some light on their origin. (1) That
white is the dominant colour : almost all the figures, whether men
or women, have white head coverings. (2) The phantom processions
are generally accompanied by a white smoke : sometimes the smoke
comes out in puffs from the procession, sometimes it lies above it
in a horizontal layer. Sometimes the appearance of a procession
is heralded by the appearance of a white smoke. This white smoke
may possibly be homologous with the cloud occasionally seen as a
preliminary to crystal vision. Mr. Naville's grandson saw in the
smoke a possible reminiscence of a torchlight procession at the
f^te of Zofingue, which would be a familiar sight to Mr. Naville in
Geneva.
F. P.
In the Revue de VHypnotiRme, March, 1909, Dr. Berillon writes on
the Psychology of Olfaction and emphasises the importance of the
part taken by the olfactory sense in the constitution of personality.
In another short paper he explains the diagnostic value of what he
has named the " signe de la detente muscidaire." He says that ability to
relax immediately all voluntary muscles is a valuable indication of a
healthy neuro-muscular state. Any slowness in passing from the
contracted to the relaxed state, or the need of any voluntary effort
in order to obtain muscular relaxation, points to some perturbation
of the cerebral functions.
Dr. Demonchy writes on the importance of the "awakening" in
Hypnotism. He thinks that sufficient attention has not been paid
to this in the past, and declares that just as the sleep of a hypnotised
person may be more or less profound, so the awakening may be
more or less complete. He says that he does not regard all the
patients that come to him for hypnotic treatment as persons who
are awake and have to be put to sleep in order to cure them,
"but often rather as persons more or less asleep Avhom it is necessary
to awake completely. Hypnotism is only a method which facilitates
the thorough awakening of the patient. There seems to be nothing
very new in this way of looking at the therapeutic side of hypnotism.
110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, im.
It is onlj' another wa}' of stating the modern view that in hypnosis
a synthesis of dissociated mental states can be effected.
There are several articles dealing with therapeutics of hypnotic
suggestion and a short notice of Dr. Pierre Janet's Les Nevroses appears.
In the Bevue de VHypnotisme, April, 1909, Dr. Paul Farez records
a case of hysteria in which a secondary personality developed.
In the Journal of Ahnornal Psychology, April-May, 1909, there is
an article by C. H. Johnston on The role of Sensations and Feelings
imder Ether. The author is of opinion that the intense mentality
of partial anaesthesis may be the active work of feelings, undisturbed
by sensory factors ; and he is inclined to justify the position of those
psychologists, at present in the minority, who claim that there is no
inseparable connection of sensation with feeling-tone.
Dr. Morton Prince concludes his monograph on The Unconscious.
He discusses the influence of dormant mental complexes on the
personal consciousness when these complexes have never formed a
part of the experience of the personal self, as is the case with
complexes originating in hypnosis or other dissociated states. Such
complexes may affect the personal consciousness through the for-
mation of co-conscious ideas, or through the persistence of the emotions
created in hypnosis. He thinks, however, that the chief mechanism
is through the stimulation of dormant complexes by associated ideas
from the environment which act as points de repere.
In The American Journal of Psychology, April, 1909, Charles W.
Waddle writes on Miracles of Healing. A useful bibliography, com-
prising ninety-one publications bearing on the subject, is given. The
author traces the history of miraculous cures in all ages and amongst
all peoples, and shows that miracle workers, being unable to explain
their own results, have invariably attached to them a religious
significance and have attributed them to such supernatural agencies
as they believed to exist. The advance of scientific psychology and
scientific psychotherapy in recent years has done much to rationalise
our views by demonstrating the possibility of explaining supposedly
supernatural happenings on the basis of laws of physical and mental
activity. While ascribing cures of a miraculous nature to the operation
of the law of suggestion, the writer is impressed with the necessity
of further careful and accurate study of the operation of this law.
" We need," he says, " far more data upon the conditions favouring
and hindering the operation of the law. We have had much
theorising but as yet too little scientific study and experimentation
in this promising field."

CORRESPONDENCE.
Identifying Characteristics of Living People.
{To the Editor of the S.P.R. Journal.)
May oth, 1909.
I am interested in the suggestion made in the Maj' Journal,.
p. 84, by Mr. Edward Bullough, that experiments should be tried
on the kinds of answers obtainable from living people, to questions
of a type similar to those which have recently been addressed to
certain "controls," especially to the trance controls of Mrs. Piper.
I think it would be quite instructive if a few carefully drawn-up
questions —asking, for instance, what a certain quotation or a certain
subject suggested—were sent round to a few people such as those
that he mentions on p. 89, to see what they would say.
I even think that in a few cases the test might be carried
further, and we might be asked whether we should send a ditferent
sort of reply if we had to dictate say to "Rector," or to the
" Nelly " control, or to a presumed stranger like Mrs. Holland.
But perhaps it is hardly likely that the same question would do
for every one. For instance, the " autos ouranos" test, so ingeniously
devised by Mrs. Verrall, and so successful in extracting information
from a Myers control, would have conveyed to me no literary
references whatever. I should not have known its source, and I
should have had no associations with it. All I could have said was
that it seemed to mean something about " heaven itself." And so
it might readily be, in my case, with other literary references out of
the beaten track.
It may be necessary, therefore, for some one to take special trouble
to select or concoct a sentence which he or she may think appropriate
for arousing definite associations in the mind of a specified living
person, and then to submit the question to that person. It does not
at all follow that the question selected would be really appropriate
but a test of the questioner, as well as of the questioned, is part of
the experiment.
While I am writing, I may add a general remark.
It has long struck me, as it has no doubt also struck others, how
very difficult a matter it is to prove identit}'', especially when general
telepathy has to be allowed for. For instance, I have often discussed
in a half jocular manner with Lad\' Lodge how I should convince
her of my identity, in a posthumous communication ; and I have
warned her that if I forget a number of incidents which she thinks
I ought to remember, such ignorance will not in the least prove a
negative, since I forget them in a wholesale manner now.
Small and intimate details—family jokes and the like—might be
recollected, but they would have to be discounted on the score of

ME. DICKINSON'S "IS IMMOETALITY DESIRABLE ?" ^
The most recent of the " Ingersoll Lectures on the Immortality
of Man," delivered annually at Harvard University, has just
been published, and it is interesting to note that this is the
first time that a member of our Council has been invited to
deliver it. The subject is treated with the clear thought, the
wide sympathy for different attitudes of mind, the concise
felicity and eloquent restraint of style that we are
accustomed to look for in Mr. Dickinson's writings, and we
cordially recommend the book to all our readers. We have
only space here to quote a few passages bearing special
reference to the work of the S.P.E.
" I must repeat . . . that it is mere dogmatism to assert
that we do not survive death, and mere prejudice or inertia
to assert that it is impossible to discover whether we do or
no. We in tlie West have hardly even begun to enquire
into the matter ; and scientific method and critical faculty were
never devoted to it, so far as I am aware, previous to the
foundation, some quarter of a century ago, of the Society for
Psychical Eesearch. . . . [The] alleged facts suggesting
prima facie the survival of death . . . are now at last being
systematically and deliberately explored by men and women
of intelligence and good faith bent on ascertaining the
truth" (pp. 46-7).
The writer concludes :
" I am not merely asking you . . .
to become clear with yourselves on a point of values ; I am
asking you further to take seriously a branch of scientific
enquiry which may have results more important than any
other that is being pursued in our time."

GENERAL MEETING.
The 134th General Meeting of the Society was held in the
Queen's Hall (Small), Langham Place, London, W., on Friday,
June 18th, 1909, at 3.30 p.m.; Sir Oliver Lodge in the chair.
Sir Olivek Lodge observed that during the last few years
the Society had been devoting its energies chiefly to the inves-
tigation of purely psychical phenomena,—automatic writing,
trance speaking and the like,—and the results had been to
his mind of the utmost importance, since they had brought
us nearer to a scientific proof of human survival after bodily
death than any evidence hitherto obtained. The phenomena
to be discussed that day were of what might be called a lower
kind,—having no bearing, as far as he could see, on the pro-
blem of human survival. They were physical phenomena,
consisting chiefly in the movements of objects apparently
without contact, or with such contact as could not normally
account for the movement ; and there seemed no reason to
attribute them to anything beyond an apparently supernormal
faculty in the medium.
He himself had had four exceptionally good sittings with
the same medium, Eusapia Palladino, in 1894, at one of the
houses of Professor Kichet, under very favourable conditions,
and subject to his own control. He had thus become con-
vinced of the genuineness of some of the phenomena produced
by her, as stated in his report of these sittings, printed in the
Journal for November, 1894. Subsequently, as most of those
present were probably aware, Eusapia had been detected in
trickery at a series of .sittings held at Cambridge in 1895.
While fully admitting the fraudulent nature of one of the
Cambridge sittings which he attended, Sir Oliver Lodge felt
quite sure that the main tricks experienced there,—namely, the
substitution of hands or feet held by two sitters, so that one
hand or foot was made to do duty for two, while the other
was freed and used to perform movements,—could not account
for the phenomena lie had previously witnessed ;
since in several
July, 1909. General Meeting. 115
cases he had himself held both hands of the medium and also
controlled her legs while some of the phenomena were occurring.
He had at that time recognised the importance of complete
holding by a single person, and had insisted on this condition
before being finally satisfied. He had therefore always retained
his conviction of the genuineness of some of her phenomena
though he felt doubtful if any evidence that could be adduced
in her case would now be regarded as of any weight by the
public. For himself the bare fact of the occurrence of unusual
physical phenomena in the presence of exceptionally constituted
people was not a matter of serious doubt ;
though of course it
was still suh judice for the Society and for the scientific world.
The Hon. Everaed Feilding then read a paper on " Some
Sittings with Eusapia Palladino," as follows :
The subject on which I am to address you this afternoon
concerns certain recent experiments conducted by Mr, Hereward
Carrington, Mr. Baggally, and myself, on behalf of this Society,
with the famous—perhaps some will expect me to use the word
notorious—medium, Eusapia Palladino, in Naples. The class of
manifestations associated with this medium belong exclusively
to what are called the physical phenomena of spiritualism.
(The word spiritualism, of course, in this connection implies a
theory to account for the phenomena in question, but in using
it I wish it to be understood that I do so only provisionally
and without intending myself either to endorse or to reject
the spiritualist hypothesis).
It is a very long time since the subject of these physical
phenomena has been considered at meetings of this Society.
Our President, Mrs. Sidgwick, did indeed touch upon them in
her Presidential Address, but only to point out that whereas
great progress had been made in almost all the other subjects
laid down for study in the original programme of the Society,
in her opinion practically no positive advance had been made
in our knowledge, not only of the nature but even of the
existence of these phenomena.
Mrs. Sidgwick would of course be the first to admit that
this opinion is merely personal to herself, and if we take into
account, as I think we should, investigations of other observers
not connected with this Society, it is an opinion which many
will not share. But so far as investigations of the Society itself
a2
116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1909.
are concerned—counting only investigations subject to the same
critical examination and careful presentment of evidence which it
has been our aim to offer regarding other branches of our work
it is strictly true. The one problem which, on the foundation
of the Society, figured so prominently in its scheme, and which,
on account of the wealth of evidence concerning it, and its
apparent susceptibility of exact examination, seemed likely to
be among the first to reach solution one way or the other,
has proved the very one upon which opinions have remained
the most divided and regarding which the hopes and expecta-
tions of the original investigators and their successors have faded
first into disappointment and ultimately almost into despair.
The reason for this failure to reach any generally accepted
conclusions as to the existence of these phenomena is not
very far to seek. In the first place, the number of persons
through whose agency they are reported to occur has always
been much restricted, and has, since the disappearance of the
famous D. D. Home, been almost entirely composed of people
of a more or less uneducated class who worked their gifts,
whatever they may have been, for gain, preferring rather to
please and astonish their own admirers, against an equivalent
in cash value, than to lend themselves to serious and exact
examination. Most of them, even if we assume their original
honesty or the occasional display by them of powers superior
to mere conjuring, succumbed to the temptations of their trade,
and finding that the bulk of their adherents were as well
satisfied with conditions which admitted opportunity for decep-
tion as with conditions which did not, chose the easier and
more profitable course of fraudulent mediumship ;
—a calling,
by the way, which has this singular advantage over any other,
that, while its value depends wholly upon a profession of
powers superior to those of ordinary mankind, a disclosure
that they are nothing of the sort appears rather to enlist the
sympathy and encouragement of your victims than to excite
their indignation and reproach. There have, it is true, been
a certain number of private persons possessing, or reputed to
possess, the powers in question, but they have for the most
part either regarded them as too sacred for investigation, or
too wicked for exercise, or else they have professed themselves
too indifferent to the whole matter or too anxious about the
July, 1909. General Meeting. 117
possible consequences to their health, to care to submit them-
selves for observation. I am of course generalizing, and there
are exceptions, but if one takes it broadly, between the decep-
tions of the one class and the difficulties raised by the other
it has been possible in this country to do but little. We are
told by our critics among convinced spiritualists that the fault
is largely ours, and that our unsympathetic attitude has been
the cause of our ill-success. I am inclined to think there
may be some justice in this complaint. But when failure has
followed upon failure, when fraud upon fraud has been dis-
covered—I need not, to those of you who have followed this
subject, recite the catalogue—a body of investigators, as well
as a single individual, would be more than human if they
resisted the current of their experiences and were able to
continue to approach the examination of fresh cases with the
same sympathy and balance as at first.
In the year 1894 a break came in the chain of negative
experiments. Attention on the continent had for some time
before been directed to Eusapia Palladino, daughter of an
Italian peasant, illiterate, unable to read, or to write more
than her own name, and to the remarkable phenomena said
to take place through her mediumship. She had already been
the subject of investigation by certain spiritualist groups of
observers, and had by them been brought to the notice, in
the first instance, of the Spanish Professor Acevedo, and later
of Professors Lombroso, Tamburini, and others. Shortly after-
wards a series of experiments were conducted by a further
group of scientific men in Milan, including Professor Schiaparelli,
the well-known astronomer. Professor Eichet of Paris, Professor
Gerosa, and Dr. Ermacora. Further experiments followed in
Warsaw by M. Ochorowicz, and eventually, in the year I have
named, 1894, Professor Eichet, whose interest had been speci-
ally stimulated, invited some of the leading members of this
Society, Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick, Mr. Myers, and Sir
Oliver Lodge, to attend a series of experiments in the South
of France. The report by Sir Oliver Lodge was printed in
the Journal S.P.B., for November, 1894, and amounted to an
expression of conviction, in which Mr. Myers concurred, of
the possession by Eusapia of some supernormal power affecting
matter, by which she was able to produce movements of material
118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, i909.
objects without any ascertainable material agency, and, still
more, produce matter itself or the appearance of matter, without
any ascertainable source of supply.
The report was subjected to much criticism, notably on the
part of Dr. Hodgson, who made a detailed analytical study of
the record of the experiments with a view to proving that it
did not of itself show that possibilities of fraud had been
excluded. This study appeared in the Journal for March-
April, 1895. I need not discuss it, except to say that it
always appeared to me more ingenious than convincing, and I felt,
balancing improbabilities, that the improbability of the truth of
the phenomena, preposterous as they were and preposterous as
the observers had themselves stated them to be, was less than the
improbability of such an eminent group of experimenters having
been deceived in the manner suggested by Dr. Hodgson.
In any case, it was felt that further experiment was
necessary, and Eusapia came to Cambridge in the summer of
1895 for an extended series of s<!^ances. You are, or at all
events most of you are, aware of what resulted. The only
issue of the experiments was to establish fraud. Eusapia
cheated, not once or twice, but apparently continuously and
deliberately, and although, from reading the unpublished records,
it would appear that there was a certain number of phenomena
for which the ascertained trickery was insufficient to account,
it was felt, I think unanimously, by the Committee, among
whom were several who had taken part in the earlier experi-
ments in Erance, that the results of these Cambridge sittings
were so unsatisfactory as to preclude any judgment in favour
of Eusapia's supernormal attributes. Not only this, but so
much doubt seemed to be thrown on the whole investigation
that it was decided to be inopportune to publish the report
of the former experiments. Eusapia was dropped, and so far
as any official investigation of her by this Society was con-
cerned, her case was considered at an end.
I am not going to discuss the justice of this conclusion or
the necessity of this policy. One thing to my mind is certain,
and that is, that the whole character and conduct of the
Cambridge sittings differed markedly from the better seances
among those which had preceded them, as well as among those
in which I have myself recently taken part. They differed in
July, 1909. General Meeting. 119
three ways. First, that for the most part they took place either
in complete darkness or in light so poor as to be useless for
purposes of observation, all attempts on the part of the experi-
menters to secure better light being resisted by Eusapia, or her
" control." Secondly, that the phenomena instead of being
varied and remarkable were monotonous and of small account
and thirdly, that Eusapia herself interposed so many difficulties
in the way of reasonable control that the observers ultimately
abandoned any attempt at eftective control whatever, and, in
order to study her methods, allowed her opportunities for cheat-
ing, of which opportunities she took the fullest advantages.
I wish, however, to correct any misapprehensions on one
point, and it is this : the Cambridge experimenters did not
discover any neio method of tricking, the possibilities of which
had not been perfectly well known before by experimenters on
the continent ; and further, that the sum total of her ascertained
fraud was the trick of substitution of hands, which Eusapia
is extremely clever at effecting when it is dark enough to
enable her to bring her two hands close together and make
the two persons holding them believe they are holding different
hands, when by mancBuvring she has contrived to get them
each to hold different parts of the same hand, thus having
her other hand free. This trick, which can only be success-
fjully done in the dark, had been actually noticed and published
by M. Torelli Viollier, a Milanese journalist, years before the
Cambridge sittings, and had already been the subject of a good
deal of discussion. There is, further, evidence, not only in the
Cambridge, but also in other records, that she also makes use of
substitution of her feet, and I have no doubt that in certain
moods she would, if permitted, make as free use of her feet
as she sometimes appears to do of her hands. So far as
I know, with the exception of a few little childish devices,
such as a hair or a nail, with which Eusapia has been pleased
to amuse herself, sometimes outside seances altogether, and
sometimes in order to bring off some special new effect at
which she is asked to try her hand, these are the only tricks
of which Eusapia has ever been definitely found guilty, in all
the countless experiments of which during the last sixteen or
seventeen years she has been the subject with scientific men
of almost every European nationality, though opinions have
120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, im
varied among those who have experimented with her as to
how often she practised them. Although, as I have said, the
net result of the Cambridge experiments was not to show
any hitherto unsuspected method of trickery, they did never-
theless show that these particular already discovered methods,
substitution of hands or feet in the dark, were far more
frequently resorted to than the continental observers had up
to then ascertained. The reply, in effect, of the continental
observers was that that was the fault of the Cambridge
group, who should not have allowed her ; and the reply of
the Cambridge group, that it was the fault of Eusapia, who
would not allow them to do anything else.
So much then for the Cambridge series, I believe the only
wholly negative series of any importance in the experience of
this medium. This Society had, as I have said, dropped her : not
so her continental investigators. From that time to this she
has undergone almost continuous experiments with Professor
Eichet, M. Camilla Flammarion, Professor and Madame Curie
and Professor d'Arsonval and their colleagues of the Institut
General Psychologique, and other distinguished men in France
Professors Bottazzi and Galeotti in Naples, and Professor
Morselli, with whose enormous work on the subject some of
you may be familiar, in Genoa. The list is by no means
exhaustive. The evidence of men of European reputation had
mounted up and could not further be ignored, and towards
the close of last year the Council of this Society decided that
the question should again be reopened, and Mr. Carrington and
I were asked to go to Naples and try to obtain a further
series of experiments with Eusapia.
I have, I fear, been a very long time in coming to my
point, but I have thought it necessary to make these pre-
liminary remarks in order to put you in possession of the
general situation, and I must still say a few words as to the
special objects in view in sending out this new Committee.
Group after group of eminent scientific men and others had
already experimented with Eusapia, and with practical unani-
mity (with the exception of the Cambridge group) tempered,
of course, in many cases with reserve, with reluctance and
with caution, and in the case of certain individual members, with
complete dissent, had reported their belief in the display by
July, 1009. General Meeting. 121
her of some force hitherto unascertained. The general public,
however, both scientific and lay, remained wholly unmoved
and unconvinced. In the eyes of the world at large a belief
in, even an interest in, the hypothesis of the existence of
such a disreputable force, was indicative,—and in this country
undoubtedly, from our omniscient big man of science to
our still more omniscient little man of the press, still is
indicative,—of a general mental unsoundness, and symptomatic
of a not distant intellectual decay. The scientific reports
produced practically no impression. The facts reported were
preposterous, and could not take place. Therefore, they did
not take place. What hope, then, is there that any report
from a Committee of far less eminence than its predecessors
can possess any interest ?
Well, the reason why the former reports have not had
more influence in forcing attention to their consideration, is
that in most of them the conclusions of the investigators
have been more prominent than the evidence by which they
were led to them. Even Sir Oliver Lodge's report of the
experiments at the ile Roubaud, which seemed detailed enough
to those who were present, was not found proof against the
hostile criticism of the absent Dr. Hodgson. Further, it was
said that men of science, accustomed to deal with the forces
of nature which do not cheat, are not the best investigators
of the forces of human nature, especially the forces of
mediumistic human nature, which generally try to. Better a
conjuror. And so upon a conjuror the choice of the Council
fell. In Mr. Hereward Carrington they found a man who,
besides having made conjuring a pursuit for many years, had
for some time conducted investigations for the American Society
for Psychical Eesearch, and after a pretty exhaustive exami-
nation of most of the physical mediums in America, had
written, to their very great annoyance and confusion, articles
in the Journal of that Society showing how they did their
tricks, as well as a large book on the Physiccd Phenomena of
Spiritualism, in which he gave his opinion that, so far as
anything that he had ever seen was concerned, there weren't
any, though he judiciously left himself a loophole as regards
things which he had not seen. We had not only one
conjuror, but two, for Mr. Baggally, a member of the Council
122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. jdlt, 1909.
of this Society, joined Mr. Carrington and myself in time for
our fifth stance. Mr. Baggally also, though not a professional,
had made a considerable practice of the art of conjuring with
special reference to the conjuring of spiritualism, and as a
result of the investigation of practically every medium that
had appeared on the spiritualist horizon for the last thirty
years, had come to the same conclusion as Mr. Carrington,
though I think without any reservation whatever. As for
myself, though not a conjuror, I had had a fairly complete
education at the hands of fraudulent mediums, my unbroken
experience of whom had led me into an attitude of entire
scepticism as regards the probability of ever finding anything
worth serious examination, and, I regret to say, into such a
habit of flippancy of mind, or at all events of utterance,
concerning these things, as to have evoked censure, both public
and private, from enquirers of a more sober temperament.
Such, then, was the Committee. As regards our method of
investigation we felt that our one object should be not merely
to come to a conclusion ourselves as to whether or not the
phenomena were true, but to present a report in such a form
as to enable a reader to judge of the possibility of our having
been deceived ;
—that is, to give an absolutely full account of
the occurrences at each stance, with a detailed statement of
the precautions taken and of the control existing at each
moment. Our first care, therefore, was to procure a short-
hand writer, who was present at an adjoining table through-
out the seances, and to whom we dictated the conditions of
light, the phenomena themselves as they occurred and the
position and the visibility of the hands, feet and head of the
medium at the moment of occurrence. Whether we have
succeeded or not, we have at least attempted to avoid the
criticism which Mrs. Sidgwick made of Professor Morselli in
her review of his book, that, before speculating upon the
agency producing the phenomena, it was advisable to have
more evidence of their existence.
The seances took place in my bedroom on the 5 th floor of
a hotel. Across a corner of the room we hung, at the
medium's request, two thin black curtains forming a triangular
recess which is called the " cabinet," about three feet deep in the
middle. Behind this curtain we placed a small round table, and
Jdly, 1909. General Meeting. 123
upon it various toys which we bought at Naples, a tambourine,
a flageolet, a toy piano, a trumpet, a tea bell, and so forth.
If you ask me to defend the reasonableness of this pro-
cedure, I can only say that, as the phenomena which take
place in Eusapia's presence consist chiefly, though not ex-
clusively, of the movements and transportations of smallish
objects within a certain radius of her, objects of some kind,
—it doesn't much matter what, —have to be placed there.
And as to the curtain, all I can say is that Eusapia believes
that the provision of a closed space helps to concentrate
" force," and that, as most of the effects seemed to radiate
from the curtain, she is possibly right.
Eusapia herself never looked behind the curtain and did
not know what had been arranged there. Outside it was
placed a small oblong table 85 A cm. x 48 cm. (2 ft. 9 in. x
1 ft. 6f in.). Eusapia herself sat at one end of this table with
her back to the curtain, the back of her chair distant from
the curtain about a foot or 18 inches. One of us sat on
each side of her, holding her hands and controlling her feet
with our legs and feet, while on certain occasions a third was
under the table holding her feet with his hands.
In front of her hung from the ceiling at a distance of
about 6 feet from her head, a group of 4 electric lights of
varying voltage, candle power, or colour, and therefore of
varying illuminating power, which could be altered from the
shorthand writer's table by means of a commutator. The
strongest light was bright enough to enable us to read small
print at the furthest end of the room, and of course at our
places at the table, while the weakest was sufficient to enable
us to see the hands and face of the medium. On a very few
occasions we were reduced to complete darkness.
We had eleven seances in all, at some of which we were
alone, while at others we invited the assistance of friends
of our own, and by way of experiment, of Eusapia's. The
seances varied greatly. It is noteworthy that among the
worst seances were those at which Eusapia's friends assisted,
while the best were among those at which we were quite
alone. As a general rule, though not invariably, the pheno-
mena classified themselves according to the prevailing light
that is, for certain phenomena a feeble light seemed necessary,
124 /ournal of Society for Psychical Research. Jdlt, im
while for others it was immaterial whether the light was weak
or strong. From the point of view of facility for trickery we
were unable to trace any special connection between the de-
gree of light and the phenomena generally producible in it.
From the first seance to the last, with certain sets back, there
was a gradual progression in the phenomena ; that is, in the
earlier stances they were restricted in variety, though not in
frequency of occurrence, while later on they became more com-
plicated. Sometimes they took place so rapidly, at the rate
of several a minute, that the dictation of one was constantly
interrupted by the occurrence of another. Sometimes they
were sparse and intermittent. On these occasions Eusapia
would ask for the light to be reduced, but we did not find
that the reduction of light had any favourable influence on
the production of the phenomena. On the contrary, the dark-
est seances were those at which least occurred.
The actual procedure of a stance was as follows : About
half-an-hour before the expected arrival of Eusapia the room
was prepared by the removal of unnecessary furniture, the
arrangement of the objects inside the curtain, and so on.
One or two of us remained there, while one went downstairs
to await her arrival. She came escorted by her husband, who
then went away, and Eusapia was brought alone up the five
flights of stairs to our rooms. She immediately sat down at
her place at the table, with her back to the curtain, behind
which, as I have said, she never looked. Sometimes the
manifestations, which I will describe presently, began at once
in the brightest light. Sometimes we had to wait half-an-
hour, an hour, even an hour and a half, before anything took
place. Those delays seemed to proceed from one of two
causes. Either she was in such a flamboyantly good temper
and talked so incessantly that she did not give her mind to
the proceedings ; or else she appeared so unwell and fatigued
as to be incapable of accomplishing anything. On the former
occasions there was nothing to do but to wait till she had tired
herself out with her own conversation. Eventually she would
begin to yawn. This was a favourable symptom, and when
the yawns were followed by enormous and amazing hiccoughs,
we knew it was time to look out, as this was the signal for
her falling into a state of a trance.
July, 1909. General Meeting. 125
Her trance was of varying stages. It was not absolutely
necessary for the production of phenomena of a simple kind,
and in two or three seances she remained wide awake
throughout and had a continuous memory of the proceedings.
Her state of half trance, which was her usual condition during
the production of phenomena, was only distinguishable from
her normal state by the fact that she was quieter in demean-
our and by the fact that she professed to have no recollection of
what had happened ; in her state of dee}) trance, however, which
did not often supervene, but, when it did, was nearly always
accompanied by the more startling phenomena, she appeared
deeply asleep, sometimes lying immovable in the arms of one
of the controllers at either side and always surrendering her-
self completely to the fullest control of her hands. In this
state she spoke little and in a deep bass voice, referred
to herself in the third person as " my daughter " or " the
medium," and called us " tu." In this state she professes to
be under the " control " of a spirit to whom she gives the name
of " John King " and who claims to be the chief agent for
the production of her phenomena. In her state of half trance
there constantly appears to be a battle between her and this
" control," which manifests itself through tilts or levitations
of the table, and, by means of a code, gives directions as to
the conduct of the seance and the degree of light to be
allowed, against which Eusapia herself often protests vigor-
ously. Thus 5 tilts of the table mean less light. Eusapia
generally insists on the light remaining up, or if it has been
diminished, on its being turned up again. The table, how-
ever, persists in its demand and Eusapia eventually gives way.
Now as to the phenomena themselves. They consisted in
the first place of levitations of the table at which we sat,
outside the curtain. As a rule the table began to rock in a
manner explainable by the ordinary pressure of her hands. It
then tilted in a manner not so explainable, that is, in a direc-
tion away from the medium while her hands were resting
lightly on the top, and finally it would leave the ground
entirely and rise to a height of one or two feet rapidly,
remain there an appreciable time and then come down.
Sometimes there would be slight contact with the hands on
the top, but very frequently no apparent contact whatever, her

hands being held by us at a distance of a foot or two from
the table, either in her lap or above the table. These levita-
tions were among the most frequent phenomena and took
place in the brightest light. No precautions that we took
hindered them in the slightest. She had no hooks, and we
could never discern the slightest movement of her knees or
feet. We very often had our free hands on her knees, while
her feet were controlled either by our feet or by one of us
under the table, and were generally away from the table legs,
a clear space being discernible between her and the table.
Sometimes a partial levitation or tilt would last a very long
time, half a minute or even a minute, during which the table
remained at an angle. We would press it down and it would
come up again as though suspended on elastics.
One of the most frequent phenomena was movements of the
curtain behind her. For this she generally, though not always,
demanded a reduction of the light, but it still remained suffi-
cient to enable every movement of the medium to be clearly
seen even from the further end of the table. She would
generally hold out one of her hands towards the curtain,
always held by or holding one of ours at a distance of about
8 or 12 inches from it, and the curtain would bulge out to-
wards it. Sometimes the same effect would be produced if one
of us held our own hands towards the curtain at her request.
The bulge was a round one, as if the curtains were pushed
out from behind. If we made a sudden grab at the bulge, no
resistance was encountered. There was no attachment to her
hand, as we constantly verified by passing our hands between
her and the curtain. Nor would any attachment produce the
the same effect, as the curtain was so thin that the point of
attachment of any string would at once have been seen. Be-
sides these bulges in response to her or our gestures, there
were spontaneous movements of the curtain, often very violent,
and frequently the whole curtain would be flung out with so
much force that the bottom of it came right over to the
further end of the table. This occurred notwithstanding that
Eusapia herself was perfectly visible and motionless, both hands
held and separately visible upon the table, her feet away from
the curtain in front of her under the table.
The next phenomenon was touches by some invisible object
July, 1909. General Meeting. 127
that is, while the light was strong enough to see the face and
hands of Eusapia, we were constantly touched on the arm,
shoulder or head by something which we could not see. The next
development was grasps through the curtain by hands. When I
say hands, I mean palpable living hands with fingers and nails.
They grasped us on the arm, shoulder, head and hands. This
occurred at times when we were absolutely certain that Eusapia's
own hands were separately held on the table in front of her.
The first occasion on which this occurred to me is among
the phenomena most vivid in my memory. I had been sitting
at the end of the table furthest from Eusapia. Mr. Car-
rington and Mr. Baggally had for some time been reporting
that something from behind the curtain had been touching
them through it. At last I told Eusapia that I wanted to
experience this also. She asked me to stand at the side of
the table and hold my hand against the curtain over her
head. I held it 2i to 3 feet above her head. Immedi-
ately the tips of my fingers were struck several times
then my first finger was seized by a living hand, three
fingers above and thumb beneath, and squeezed so that I felt
the nails of the fingers in my flesh ;
and then the lower
part of my hand was seized and pressed by what appeared
to be the soft part of a hand. Eusapia's two hands were
separately held by Messrs. Carrington and Baggally, one on the
table and one on her knee. These grasps, if fraudulent, could
only have been done by an accomplice behind the curtain.
There was no accomplice behind the curtain.
The next development was that these hands became visible.
They generally, though not always, appeared between the part-
ing of the curtains over Eusapia's head. They were of
different appearances, dead, paper white, and of a natural colour.
I think only once was a hand both seen and felt at the
same time, and that was when a hand came out from the
side, not the middle of the curtain, seized Mr. Baggally and
pulled him so hard as almost to upset him off his chair.
I have followed the general development of these hands
through the course of the seances, but meanwhile other pheno-
mena had been occurring. As a rule, after the movements
of the curtain, the first manifestation took the form of violent
noises inside the cabinet, as though the tea table were being
128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1909.
shaken. It was sometimes shaken so hard that the objects
on it fell off. It then itself appeared over Eusapia's shoulder
and landed on our table horizontally, that is, with its top
resting on our table and its legs pointing into the cabinet.
It would then, during the space of a minute appear to hang
there, partly supported no doubt by Eusapia's arm or ours
as we held her hand, and try to climb on our table, which
it never, however, succeeded in doing, but eventually fell back.
This transportation of the table took place several times, till
at length, to prevent its upsetting our arrangement of the
objects on it, we took to tying it down, after which it was once
or twice violently shaken, but did not otherwise molest us.
After this, however, the objects which had been placed upon
it were transported from within one by one. The flageolet
tapped me on the head, the tambourine jumped on to my lap,
the toy piano landed on the head of a friend of mine ; the
tea bell was rung and presently appeared, ringing, over
Eusapia's head carried by a hand which attached it quickly
to her hair, and just as I was putting up my free hand to
detach it, reappeared, detached the bell itself, rang it again
over Eusapia's head, and threw it on to the seance table.
While this was occurring I was holding Eusapia's left hand
close to my face, while Mr. Baggally held her right hand
under the curtain on the opposite corner of the table, and
the light was sufficient for the shorthand writer from his
table, at a distance of about 8 or 9 feet from Eusapia, to
see the hand which carried the bell.
One of the most interesting transportations of objects was
that of a board on which we had put a large lump of wet
clay in the hope of obtaining an impression of one of these
hands. I was controlling to Eusapia's right, and Mr. Ryan, a
friend of mine whom we had invited to the seance, to her
left, and therefore opposite to me. Her right hand was under
mine on my side of the table. Her left hand was on Mr.
Eyan's on his side. Both were motionless and visible. Mr.
Carrington was standing behind me. The clay had been placed
on the tea table inside the curtain, directly behind Eusapia.
At a certain moment Mr. Carrington saw it appear at the
further side of the curtain, behind Mr. Eyan, and travel
through the air on to Mr. Eyan's shoulder. I noticed it first
JULT, 1909. General Meeting. 129
at that point. I saw it slide gently clown his right arm, across
Eusapia's hand which held his, cross the table towards me, and
land on the top of my hand which held Eusapia's right.
Another class of phenomenon consisted of lights, which at one
seance appeared twice over her head, once in her lap, and once
at the side of the curtain furthest from her. They were of three
kinds, a steady blue-green light, a yellow light, and a small
sparkling light like the spark between the poles of a battery.
Besides the visible hands, which were clear and distinct,
there were also more or less indescribable appearances of
various kinds, in themselves of the most suspicious character
white things that looked like handfuls of tow ; black things
like small heads at the end of stalk-like bodies, which emerged
from the middle or side of the curtain and extended them-
selves over our table ;
shadowy things like faces with large
features, as though made of cobweb, that shot with extreme
rapidity and silence from the side of the curtain.
There were also other phenomena, but the last which I
shall touch on now were movements of objects outside the
curtain at a distance from Eusapia of from one to three feet. I
speak chiefly of a stool which was placed on the floor, about
a yard from Eusapia. She held her hand towards it, held by
one of us, and presently the stool moved towards her ; she then
made gestures of repulsion, and it moved away from her. The
shorthand writer, who, during part of the time, was standing
close to it, passed his hand round it several times to ascertain
that it had no attachment, but it continued to move. There was
a clear space between her and it. The light was sufficient for
me to follow the movements of the stool while I was standing
up at the end of the table furthest from Eusapia.
I am not attempting in this paper to do more than describe
the kind of thing that took place. For the precautions that
we took, for the searchings of the medium's person, for the
control that existed at the time of the production of each
phenomenon, and for a general discussion of the possibilities
of deception (incidentally I may remark that two or three
times we had opportunity in sufficient light to observe her
substitution trick, unaccompanied, however, by any phenomena),
or hallucinatioiL, I must refer you to our detailed report when
it is published.
130 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1909.
( ' 1 1 am fully aware that for evidential purposes a statement
of the kind I am now making is absolutely valueless, nor do
I pretend that for all the phenomena I have described the
conditions were of equal evidential value. I have, however,
to report on the part of my two colleagues and myself our
firm conviction that for some of the phenomena, including
some of the more remarkable ones, we obtained evidence of
unimpeachable validity. Further, that though a considerable
portion of the manifestations, taken by themselves, must be
regarded as non-evidential, we had no ground for believing in
the fraudulent production of any one of them.
On the other hand, I wish it to be clearly understood that
this expression of conviction is a purely personal one on the
part of the actual investigating committee, and in no way
represents the corporate view of the Council of this Society,
which, by the way, has no corporate view on any subject
whatever, and the majority of which has not yet even seen
our report, which has not yet passed through the press.
I will, in conclusion, say one thing more. While I have
convinced myself of the reality of these phenomena and of the
existence of some force not yet generally recognised which is
able to impress itself on matter, and to simulate or
create the appearance of matter, I refrain for the present
from speculating upon its nature. Yet it is just in this
speculation that the whole interest of the subject lies. The
force, if we are driven, as I am confident we are, to pre-
suppose one other than mere conjuring, must either reside in
the medium herself and be of the nature of an extension of
human faculty beyond what is generally recognised ; or must
be a force having its origin in something apparently intelligent
and external to her, operating either directly from itself, or
indirectly through or in conjunction with some special attribute
of her organism. The phenomena then,—in themselves pre-
posterous, futile, and lacking in any quality of the smallest
ethical, religious, or spiritual value,—are nevertheless sympto-
matic of something which, put at its lowest by choosing the
first hypothesis, must, as it filters gradually into our common
knowledge, most profoundly modify the whole of our philosophy
of human faculty ; but which, if that hypothesis is found in-
sufficient, may ultimately be judged to require an interpreta-
July, 1909. General Meeting. 131
tion involvino- not onlv that modification, but a still wider
one, namely, our knowledge of the relations between mankind
and an intelligent sphere external to it. Although one may-
approach the investigation of the phenomena themselves in a
light, shall I say, even a flippant spirit,—(I sometimes think
that in this way alone one can preserve one's mental balance
in dealing with this kind of subject),—one must regard them
as the playthings of the agency which they reveal, and the
more perfect revelation of that agency, whatever it may be,
through the study of them, is surely a task as worthy of the
most earnest consideration as any problem with which modern
science is concerned. If our report, by reason of its form and
detail, is found to do something towards supplying a further
evidential basis for, and therefore directing the attention of
men of science in this country towards, the far more important
and elaborate published investigations of many of our more
eminent predecessors, and of inducing them to take a part in
the research, I shall feel that it has amply served its purpose.
Me. W. W. Baggally then spoke to the following effect
In forming an opinion on the phenomena that we witnessed in
the presence of Eusapia Palladino, it was very important to
bear in mind any normal methods by which she might have
produced them. Thus, it might be supposed that she had
freed • one of her hands or fc^t by substitution or by the
mere removal of it from the hand or foot of the controller,
leaving him under the impression that he still felt it ; or
that she used her head or some other part of her body, or
some mechanism concealed about her person, or that she had
an accomplice. But all these methods would require darkness,
whereas it was in light, more or less strong, that the majority of the
phenomena took place. In many cases both hands of Eusapia were
distinctly seen above or quietly resting on the seance table, or both
her hands were clearly seen as they were held by the controllers,
and at the same time her body was in view down to her feet.
I will now refer to one or two phenomena which took
place under these conditions. At the termination of Seance VI.,
the light being good, the medium released both her hands
from control and placed them on the table. They were
perfectly visible to all of us. The curtain on her right, which
was not in contact with any part of her body, made a slight
132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1909.
movement. Owing to the good light and to my position, I
could see distinctly, at the same moment, her head, her two
hands, her body down to her feet and the curtain, which
was close to me, but not touching her. Very shortly after-
wards, while I was still intently watching Eusapia, who did
not move, the curtain bulged out as if pressed by a balloon
from within the cabinet. The bulge was about a foot and a
half from her head and on a level with it. She was examined
shortly afterwards at this S(^ance, and no mechanism was found
concealed about her person. The force which produced the
phenomena seemed capable both of attracting and of repelling
matter. On one occasion, the little stool, which was placed at
a distance of 3 feet from Eusapia, moved away from her when
she made a motion of her hand as if pushing it, and came
towards her when she moved her hand as if beckoning it. I
was between her and the stool, controlling her foot. Her hand
was in mine when she made the motions, and at a distance
of several feet from the stool.
At the eleventh seance a hand squeezed my left hand several
times and grasped my left arm. At the time not only could
I see the mediun:i's hands, but I was grasping them separately
by her two thumbs with both my hands, and keeping them a
good distance apart. Mr. Feilding then spontaneonsly said that
he conld see me doing this (which showed that I was not
hallucinated). The control of Eusapia's foot was verified by
me at the time, and she could not have raised it to the
height of my hand and arm without detection.
I have no theory to advance as to the nature of the force
that was manifested at these seances, but I witnessed enough
phenomena under the strict conditions above described to con-
vince me of the existence of some supernormal force which
manifests itself in the presence of this medium, and is capable
of moving matter at a limited distance from her body.

A EEPLY TO PEOFESSOE PIGOU'S CEITICISM
OF CEOSS-COEEESPONDENCES.
By Sir Oliver Lodge.
At the conclusion of the recently issued Part of the
Proceedings (Part LVIII. Vol. XXIIL, pp. 286-303) there is
an interesting discussion by Professor Pigou of the legitimate
deduction that can be made concerning the source of the
cross-correspondences which have been so far reported.
He discusses the question with an open mind, and leaves it
open at the end, but he is inclined to press for the proba-
bility that the whole thing originates in the subliminal activity
of one or more of the autoniatists; and he adduces as the
chief argument in favour of this view the fact that the auto-
matic writings obtained by Mrs. Verrall, in response to an
effort of Dr. Verrall to transmit the substance of a literary
episode, exhibited very similar flaws and difficulties and bore
a very close resemblance to the script obtained, also through
Mrs. Verrall, in response to an ostensible attempt from a Myers
control to construct and convey a characteristic literary allusion.
In fact, Professor Pigou claims that the " one-horse dawn
"
incident exhibits throughout all the signs of a typical case of
complementary cross-correspondence, and runs in close analogy
with the " Browning, Hope and Star " and the " Hail, immortal
Eome " incidents.
With this statement I fully concur. I admit the close
resemblance of this whole episode with those which are claimed
as the work of a discarnate mind. But the argument which
Professor Pigou bases upon this fact is that, just as the
former script originated wholly in subliminal activities, so also
the latter scripts must probably have originated so likewise.
Here however I disagree, for I must deny the premise. The
" one-horse dawn " script originated not at all in subliminal
activities, but in the conscious plan and intention of Dr.
Verrall.
Undoubtedly the agency of transmission was subliminal
activity,—the transmission was quite beyond Dr. Verrall's
conscious power,—but it was his intelligence and active mind
which set the subliminal activities to work. It sat above
Oct., 1909. ProfessoT Pigou on Gross-Correspondences. 135
them and pulled the strings, or at any rate it initiated the
enterprise.
Let this be applied to other complementary cross-corre-
spondences, and the moral is obvious.
So far as the incident goes, it shows that subliminal
activities do 7iot originate things of this sort. They carry out
an effective suggestion, externally initiated, just as the
subliminal activities of Pierre Janet's or Charcot's patients
carry out their physiological or pathological suggestions ; but
an intelligent mind is needed to start the whole business, and
if it were not thus started, any result obtained would presum-
ably be mere gibberish and would mean nothing to anybody.
The only reason why all that apparently meaningless stuff
quoted on p. 301 of Professor Pigou's paper has any signi-
ficance, is because Dr. Verrall tells us what his intention
was ; he says he endeavoured to transmit something about a
one-horse dawn ; and in the light of that information we
perceive that the fragments fit in.
Similarly the posthumous Myers control claims that he was
trying to transmit something about Browning, Hope and a
Star, or about Eome and two persons, one of whom was
Primus inter ^xtres ; and we perceive that in his case also
the fragments fit in.
It is true that we may believe the one testimony and not
the other, but my contention is that the similarity of the
" one-horse dawn " incident to the "Abt Vogler " and the other
incident is a help and not a hindrance to those who think
they detect the initiating agency of the persisting intelligence
of some specific individual.
In so far as the one case was certainly brought about by
an incarnate intelligence, and in so far as any deduction by
analogy can be drawn, it may be held to follow that the
other cases were brought about by a discarnate intelligence
for by analogy both sets of messages were initiated by intel-
ligences, acting of set purpose, conscious of what they wished,
though constrained to achieve something like the desired
result by unknown means through unconscious channels. And
the one intelligence purported to be that of F. W. H. Myers,
just as the other intelligence purported to be that of Dr.
Verrall.
136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1 909.
The 'set purpo.se '
in the discaniate cases was indeed specially
emphatic, since the round-about and allusive character of those
scripts was not solely accidental or trivial or fautc de mieux ;
it has the air of being part of a plan, for it is essential to
a real effective cross-coiTespondence that the fragments sepa-
rately shall be unintelligible, each to its respective medium,
in order that the operation of ordinary living telepathy may
be excluded.
A CASE OF HALLUCINATION.
By J. G. PiDDINGTON.
I LEARNT from Dr. M. that a patient of his, whom I will
call Mrs. E., had had a curious psychical experience. The
account which he gave me was briefly as follows
Mrs. R., who had given birth to a son over two years previously,
was expecting her second confinement in the beginning of June. On
April 12th, 190 ,^ she gave birth to a seven months' child. During
the labour, which lasted rather over four hours, she saw almost con-
tinuously the figure of her father, who had been dead twelve months,
standing by her. During her first confinement she had seen a
blue-grey bird perched on the picture-rail, and had thought that the
doctors attending her—Di-. M. and Dr. C. —weie trying, or at any rate
wishing, to crush the life out of it.
Dr. M. obtained Mrs. E.'s permission for me to call upon
her, which I did on May 7th, 190—, and I wrote the present
account on the following day. My interview with Mrs. E. lasted
sixty-five minutes, and she impressed me as being an exception-
ally clear-headed and scrupulous witness. The record of the
interview which follows does not profess to reproduce Mrs. E.'s
statements rcrhatim, except where words are enclosed in inverted
commas. Mrs. E., though choosing her words carefully, spoke
with too great fluency to allow of my taking down her ijjsissima
verba. I regret that I could not do so, for she described her ex-
periences with a nicety and discrimination of phrase to which
my record does faint justice. jMy record has, however, been
revised by Mrs. E. and her husband, and may accordingly be
considered to be accurate so far as it goes.
^ The precise date is given in Mr. Pidilington's original account, whicli is
in our possession. Editor.

Record of Interview.
Mks. R. At 9.20, on the morning of April 12th, 190—, I was seated
on a sofa by the window in the drawing-room writing oi\t
on a slate the menu for dinner, when " my father walked
into the room."
J. G. P. Did you see him walk in 1
Mrs. R. No; I was just going to explain. I say "walked in," but I
didn't actually see him do so. After the experience was
over—it lasted some hours—I asked myself, " How did I
know my father came in?" "Did I see his legs mover'
And I also asked myself why did I say to Dr. M. (whom I
saw about 2.4.5 p.m. that afternoon) that my father
" walked in." The answer I gave myself was this :
" His
appearance had to my brain all the ordinary concomitants
of the physical life." I can't, then, say how he came in ;
and I can't say how he was dressed. I don't know
whether I saw his arms and legs. I saw his face very
clearly, especially his eyes, which were always very
striking.
J. G. P. Did you notice any colour?
Mrs. R. It appeared to me as a form seen at dusk. The eyes and
brow appeared as they would in broad daylight.
J. G. P. Did they stand out from the rest of the features ?
Mes. R. No ; I can't describe exactly. Let me try and explain. After
you've gone I shouldn't be able to say what coloured suit
you had on. It would be just the same with any visitor.
I realised only after this experience that I'm not much
in the habit of noticing what kind of clothes people
wear, especially when their conversation is absorbing or
interesting me.
The child was born about 1.45 p.m., and lived a few
hours.
J. G. P. When had you expected the birth ?
Mrs. R. About seven weeks later. I had no idea that the pains I was
suffering when the figure first appeared were the beginning
of labour. I stayecl in the drawing-room from 9.20 till
12.30, and all the time my father was in the room, within
two feet, or less, of me. I was lying on the sofa, and
my father was standing close beside me and looking down
at me. I was looking into his eyes, and he into mine
138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., im
Yet there was no sense of physical fatigue, such as there
would have been if two ordinary people had been staring
at each other for three hours.
J. G. P. While you were looking at your father were j'ou aware of
pain 1
Mes. R. Yes. When the vision began I was thinking about cookery,
and not about my father at all. The pain I thought was
colic or cramp. I had no idea it was labour.
J. G. P. Do you think that the vision of your father had the efltect
of deadening the pain at all 1
Mrs. R. That, of course, is a very difficult thing to say. The pains
due to the muscular contractions were probably not
diminished. When these pains came on "I pi'obably shut
my eyes and my inner vision too," and did not see my
father. But during the interludes I think I was conscious
only of my father's presence, and did not feel as much
pain as otherwise I should have done. I can, of course,
only judge by comparison with the pain I suffered during
my first labour ; and that may be misleading as a standard
of comparison, because, as is often the case in a first
labour, it was greatl}' protracted and very severe.
J. G. P. Did you speak to your father 1
Mes. R. During my first confinement my favourite aunt, who had been
dead about seven years, came into the room, and I clearly
remember beseeching her repeatedly to take me with her.
When this happened I had been inhaling a mixture of
chloroform, ether, and alcohol.
J. G. P. Had you seen the figure of your aunt before you began to
inhale ?
Mrs. R. I don't remember for certain whether I saw my aunt before
or after I began inhaling.^ AVhen I first saw my father
^ Mrs. R. wrote on May 11, 190—, as follows : "I only saw the figure of my
aunt during the last twenty hours or so of labour. But the figure of the blue-
grey bird appeared nearly forty-two hours before the birtli, and remained for
about five or six hours on the picture-rail. I spoke to it very often, I am told,
and especially spoke to '
others ' who appeared to be attempting to catcli or
crush or injure it. The bird was very much in my thoughts, very real and very
dear to me, and its safety was the one thing I thought of at the time, and during
all the time I was aware of it. But I had very little recollection of its having
appeared for some days afterwards."
Oct., 1909. A Case of Hallucination. 139
I had not inhaled any of the mixture. My aunt looked
"angelic;" there was, as it were, "a brightness about
her." My father looked like an ordinary human being
seen in the dusk; or rather, I should say, "seen at the
last point of daylight at which one can see a figure."
When I left the drawing-room and went to my bedroom
I didn't see the figure of my father. I can't say the
figure disappeared. I just forgot to think about it
After lying on my bed face-downwards to get relief from
pain, and perhaps after two, three, or five minutes, I
turned over on my back—that particular pain having
passed—and I saw my father standing close by my bed-
side just the same as in the drawing-room, except that
the light in the drawing-room fell on his face, whereas
in the bedroom " I was distinctly conscious of a figure
between me and the light." I was also conscious of there
being "a countenance on the top of the figure," but I did
not notice other details.
J. G. P. Did you speak to the figure in the bedroom 1
Mks. R. In the drawing-room my father was just like an ordinary
human being, and I was not aware that he was dead. In
the bedroom there was a new phase. I thought I was
a young girl of sixteen ; and I seemed to resume the
ordinary tenour of my life at that age. I thought I was
living at home as I was at the age of sixteen. I thought
I was out riding with my father. Something went wrong
with a stirrup, and the groom
J. G. P. Did you see the groom ?
Mks. R. No; I didn't see him. "I sensed he was there." The groom
couldn't get the stirrup right. This part of my experience
was rather like a mild nightmare. My husband, who
was in the bedroom with me for a short time, says
that I was talking a great deal with my father, and
that I asked him (my father) to come, and said I wanted
him. He also heard me talking about the stirrup a great
deal. I was then inhaling at intervals. I can't remember
seeing my father after I was told the child was born.
It was only during the last quarter of an hour that I
realised that the pains I was suffering were those of
child-birth.

J. G. P How was it, if you were not expecting labour to come on,
that you had the chloroform, ether and alcohol mixture
by you? '-
Mrs. R. I had been having cramp.s for months back, and had been
inhaling the mixture, a very mild anaesthetic, now and
again to relieve them a little.
Aiter the child was born I lay and wondered if my
father would come again ; but he didn't.
J. G. P. Were you at all frightened by your experience ?
Mrs. R. (laughing) No ; not in the least. I delighted in his presence
of which I had been deprived for a year.
J. G. P. Besides these two visions—one of your father and one of
your aunt—have you had any others ']
Mrs. R. Yes. I first saw a figure when I was thirteen years old.
At that age I was very much afraid of the dark; but,
as you will see, this vision cured me of my dread.
I was in bed, unable to sleep. I heard a knock at the
door, and felt ver}^ nervous. I waited, but nothing
happened. I then put the bedclothes over my head and
tried to go to sleep. Then came three knocks at the
door. I called out " Come in
;
" but no one came in.
I was in awful terror, and was trembling in agony. For
a. time nothing further happened. After what seemed
like an hour, and as I- was settling down to sleep, I
said a prayer for protection for the whole house. I began
to think over what had happened, and I said to myself
" I am a coward
;
" and I determined to overcome my
cowardice. So I went to the door and opened it. Before
me stood a tall figure, taller than the architrave of the
door by which it stood. (It was standing by a door
opposite mine.) It was about 7 to 8 feet high. It was
dressed in a grey cloak. Where the face should have
been was darker than the rest of the figure, and the
cavity of the eyes was darker. I could not exactly dis-
tinguish the eyes, only the cavitj' where they should
have been. I saw no limbs. I was in perfectly good
health at the time. I Vjanged the door shut and fled
back in to bed. I was dreadfully afraid ;
but I said to
myself I must see it again ; and I was conscious that
I was deliberately exerting my will to conr|uer my fear.
Oct., in09. A Case of Hallucination. 141
I -went to the door and opened it. I saw the figure again
across the passage just the same as before. For the first
time my fear began to disappear. The figure seemed to
move like spray seen in sunshine. I mean it seemed to
move within itself, without liowever moving forwards.
Then the figure grew smaller, turned and moved—pro-
gressed without limbs (it had no legs)—glided round a
corner. I then got a shock, for I saw a basket containing
linen at a spot on the passage floor, where it was not
the custom to place such things. I followed the figure
down the passage as far as the door of my brother's
room, who was lying ill with ear-ache. He died five
days later. (No—I'm not sure if my brother was in
that room on that night ; but he certainly was the next
day.) The figure then disappeared in the doorway of my
brother's own room, which was next to the room in
which he died five or six days later. I then went back
to bed and was in a sort of dazed state for some time It
was February. The clock struck four, and as I listened
to it I began to be nervous again, so I made myself get
up and go out into the corridors. I gently opened every
door on the first floor and ground floor and looked in
(merely to overcome the nervousness), and then went
out of the garden door and all about the garden ; and
it was when I was out of doors that all fear passed,
and I came in again feeling unusually elated. And never
again during my childhood did I have the least fear of
the dark, not even to swim in a lake or tarn at midnight.
And this liberation from the awful slavery of fear I owe
entirely to this apparition.
Some nights afterwards, when my brother's body had
been laid out, the linen was placed in a basket at the
spot in the passage where I had seen the basket of linen
when following the figure.
When I sent Mrs. E. my record of our interview^, I put
her several questions, which she answered in a letter dated
May 11, 190 —. From this letter I append some extracts.
"... My senses were so dulled by the pain, and my memory
by the weakness and prostration, which followed [the first confine-
ment], that accurate details elude me now, especially as to what I
did or said at the time.
142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1909.
The only things which have all along remained vividly clear are :
the blue-grey bird and my anxiety to protect it. Then the beautiful
vision of my aunt, and uiy intense longing to go to her. Both
these (the bird and the angelic vision) came at intervals during the
Wednesday night, i.e. after 11.30 p.m. The labour began about
11 p.m. on Wednesday night, and lasted through Thursday, Thursday
night, and Friday. Chloroform was administered about 6.15 p.m. on
Friday, and the child born at 7.30 p.m.
The visions were recurrent, especially the bird. Whenever I
turned to that side of the room I saw the bird on the picture rail
facing the window. I saw the visions both before and after inhaling
the A.E.C. mixture. I clearly remember that of my aunt recurring
three times; twice during the Wednesday night, remaining for long
spaces of time; and again on Friday afternoon.
Another thing which I remember with terrible clearness, is the
utter blank despairing disappointment when I awoke after the child
was born, and realised that I had to remain on earth, and had not
been allowed to go to my aunt. A sort of frenzy of longing seized
me to gather up my husband and child, and fly to her. For the
vision so penetrated me with a wonderful sense of exquisite and
calm joy and heavenly satisfiedness (if one can use the word), that
to come back to an earthly bedroom was really an agony. It was
a harsh and jarring sense of forlornness and misery which I shall
never forget as long as I live.
... I never saw the bird moving to different places, though it ims
in different parts of the picture rail. . . . But I often saw the
bird tremble in its feathers, and its head moved. It had dark
china-blue wings, and a light grey-blue breast. In shape it was
like a bullfinch, but considerably larger, and [it had] a longer tail.
It remained for long spaces together on the rail, and I never saw
it in the act of going awaj', although sometimes it did not appear
to be there. (You will remember that we are speaking of a period
of more than 40 hours' duration.)
I did not touch the figure of my father, nor that of my aunt.
I spoke often to both of them, but they did not answer. And yet
my father's changing expressions of face did serve as conversation
without any actual words. I thought he spoke several times to
the groom whom I could not see, for he was between the two
horses. I saw the horses quite distinctly, but only for a short
time—in my bedroom, not downstairs.
With my aunt it was quite different. It was not like friendly
Oct., 1909. A Case of Hallucination. 143
human intercourse. Her atmosphere, her aura, penetrated me. She
seemed to fill me with rays of her own effulgence, which gave me
indescribable joy. But when the vision faded, and liefore it
re-appeared again, I felt like an outcast, and trembled lest I should
really be left behind. I can distinctly remember kneeling before
her when she re-appeared, and beseeching her to take me ;
though
I cannot say whether I kneeled physically and sjwlie the words ])hym(dly.
But I think I did.
My aunt had arms, I know, because she held them out to me
the rest of her body was like shining draperies, and they shone
on the floor."
CASE.
L. 1177. Veridical Auditory Hallucination.
The following account of a telepathic auditory hallucination was
sent to us by Mr. Severin Lauritzen, an Associate of the Society.
Mr. Lauritzen, who, it will be observed, recorded the case
a few minutes after its occurrence, writes
HoLTE, Denmark, May 5th, 1909.
I live in a villa in the country, and in a neighbouring villa lives
my married daughter, who is named Evelyn. There is only a
distance of 33 steps, or say some 22 yards, in a straight line, between
the houses. I have a telephone from a central station in my house,
and also a short private telephone that connects the two houses. I
commence writing this 1.20 p.m., May 5th. The same day about
1 o'clock my son-in-law, K., telephoned from his place of business in
the town to my house to say that he wanted to speak with Evelyn.
It was my wife who answered the telephone when K. called, and
when she heard what he wanted she immediately pressed the button
of the private telephone to summon E. Just before this moment E.
heard her mother's very clear and distinct voice call "Evelyn,
Evelyn." She arose from her writing-desk where she sat absorbed
in household accounts, opened the door to the hall in her house,
and asked Miss N., who was working there: "Did mother call?"
"No," said Miss N., "nobody called." E. said: "Yes, she did call."
Then she turned to go back to an open window in the room where
she had been writing, to see if her mother was outside there ; but
she did not reach the window before she heard the private telephone
bell sounding, so she turned again and went straight to my house
without answering the call per telephone. Passing the telephone
14-t Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct.,1909.
and Miss N., she said, '•
There, you see, mother called." Arrived
at my house, she foutid that her husband wanted to speak with
her. Just as she had finished her conversation with her husband,
I came out from an adjacent room to speak with her, but she
interrupted me and said, " Now we have a clear case of telepathy !
When E. walks in her garden she can sometimes, with a favourable
wind (west), ami when certain doors and windows in my house
are open, hear my public telephone bell sounding, and she expected
her husband to call her per telephone in the course of the day.
But to hear my public telephone in this case, the sound would have to
pass to her from the hall in my house either through my kitchen (door
from hall to kitchen was open), then through a closed door to a
pantry, through the pantiy and an open window there facing east,
further across the gardens and round a corner of her house, through
an open window there and into her room, or from my hall upstairs
through a closed door and a bedroom, and then through an open
window there facing east, then down and across the gardens, etc.
all with an easterly wind, the most unfavourable. At two o'clock the
same day, I tried whether my public telephone could be normally
heard where E. had been sitting. I had even opened the above-
named pantry door, but not one of three persons [who tried]
could hear the telephone bell. Nobody was in the gardens when
E. K. heard her name. In fact, nobody calling her by her Christian
name could be there.
This, it seems to me, is a case of subliminal perception and
translation either of a telepathic impulse or at least of a subliminally
caught, extremely weak, sound. There is at least the interesting
translation (so often met with in telepathic and other cases), because
there was no one actualhj calling " Evelyn, Evelyn." INIy wife corroborates
this ; I myself heard from my room all the proceedings in my hall,
and we never call out in such cases ; it would be absurd not to
take the private telephone instead.
I have much reason to believe that neither my wife nor my
daughter is in any way "sensitive" or " mediumistic."
S. Lauritzen.
This account is corroborated as follows
The facts were as given above.
(Miss) Ckcilie Nielsen.
(Mrs.) Eva Kemp.
(Mrs.) DoKOTHEA Lauritzen.
I
Oct., 1909. Case. 145
Later, Mr. Lauritzen adds: June 2dth, 1909.
Mrs. L. was in a room upstairs with an open window eastward.
When she heard the telephone call she just looked out of the
Avindow to see whether Mrs. Kemp was accidentally in the garden
outside, because she thought it might be Mr. Kemp who called,
and she would then have informed her that the telephone called.
Not seeing Mrs. Kemp there, she at once turned round, went eight
steps down the stairs, and took the telephone, heard Mr. Kemp say,
" I want to speak with Eva," or some such short remark, said
"Yes," turned round, and pressed the private telephone button to
summon Mrs. Kemp. Now, you remember that Mrs. K. heard her
mother call her, went to her hall, said, "Did mother calU" returned
to her room just beside the hall, and turned again when hearing her
private telephone, or she heard it in passing it. You will see how
unlikely it is that she should hear her mother's call immediately
after our public telephone had sounded, or as a consequence of its
having sounded. No, the time between Mrs. L. looking out of her
window and her pressing the private telephone button (the telephones
are placed one yard apart), and the time between Mrs. Kemp's
leaving her writing-desk and her hearing the private bell, must
have been almost exactly the same; so I am quite convinced that
the moment Mrs. L. looked out of her window to call Mrs. K.
(but she did noi call out), was the moment of the telepathic impact.
The ladies are lively and intelligent, and fully aware of the import-
ance of being accurate in such matters. S. Lauritzkn.
NOTES ON CURRENT PERIODICALS.
Ix the Archives de Psychologie for April, 1909, M. Emile Yung has an
article on "Suggestibility in the Waking State." His duty is to
instruct the first year students at the University of Geneva in
microscopy. Before the pupils are allowed to examine an object
through the microscope, he gives them a short verbal description of what
they are to see. Some years since one of the pupils brought him a
drawing of a diatom which was so unlike the original that he sent
him back to the microscope. The second attempt was as remote from
nature as the first, and M. Yung, looking hurriedly through the
microscope, found that the object-slide was empty !
Acting on the hint he took occasion, in the course of fifteen years,
to place empty slides before 80 pupils. Of these 63 reported that
the slides were empty, 6 saw images too A^ague to draw, or possibly
figures explicable by " mouches volantes." But 11 produced finished
146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1909.
designs, obviously inspired by the verbal description given in the
lecture. All these students were between eighteen and twenty years.
Similar experiments succeeded in a higher proportion amongst younger
students. But M. Yung in no case succeeded in makina; a second or
third year student, who had previous experience in microscopic work,
see figures on an empty slide.
A further series of experiments in suggestion showing effects from a
" magnetised " card proved even more successful. Of 420 persons
83"8 per cent, proved suggestible, the proportion being higher amongst
women than amongst men, and amongst those under twenty than
amongst those above that age. Indeed, all the forty-four students under
twenty proved in some manner suggestible. The hallucinations weiu
(1) muscular, a thrill or a shock; (2) tactile, including a feeling if
warmth; (3) olfactory; (4) visual, the movement of the card;
(5) auditory. The last two were rarely successful.
The results are very similar to those described by Braid fiftv
years ago.
The Psychological Review, July, 1909, contains a long article by
Professor June Downey on Muscle Reading (with contact), which,
however, has no direct reference to telepathy : and there is, perhaps,
from the standpoint of Psychical Research, nothing strikingly new
in the results obtained. But a careful exploration of the field of
muscle reading serves to illustrate once more the extreme difficulty
of excluding all possible sensory indications in telepathic experimenting
at close quarters. For "it is difficult to comprehend without first-
hand experience the wonderful accuracy of the operator's [percipient's]
response to the slightest variation in the guide's [agent's] muscular
tension. H., for instance has, as guide, placed a clock on a ledge
above a long table which is three and a half feet wide and flat
against the wall. On Dy's arrival at the table, H. begins to chuckle,
mentally thinking 'she can never reach it.' Dy raises herself on
tip-toe and leans over the table exclaiming, 'I can never reach it.'
H. sees in a visual flash Dy climbing the table and Dy actually
pulls herself over the table and gets the clock." Unfortunately,
however, in this case we are not told whether the clock was going.
Miss Downey found that between 70 and 80 per cent, of the persons
tested by her proved fairly good subjects for simple muscle reading
experiments, such as finding hidden objects. She lays stress upon
the extraordinary difficulty which most persons experience in realising
their own unconscious muscular movements. Very few could succeed
in observing them : many refused to accept the explanation.
Oct., 1909. Notes on Current Literature. 147
Four cases of pronounced verbal automatism, —whispering, or moving
the lips, —were observed : when it was recorded, it was found that
the agents were completely unconscious of their actions. F. P.
In the Revue de VHypnotisme, May, 1909, Dr. Berillon suggests
that the phenomena associated with the production and cessation of
sleep tend to demonstrate the existence of a cerebral " centre of
awakening," a motor centre presiding over a group of motor activi-
ties on which awakening and the maintenance of the waking state
depend. Hypnosis is due to inhibition of this centre, and the
termination of hypnosis comes with the removal of the inhibition.
The evidence put forward by Berillon in support of his contention
seems inconclusive.
In the Revue de VHypnotisme, June, 1909, there is an interesting
paper by Dr. Georges d'Hotel on the importance of dilatation of the
pupil as a sign of suggestibility in the Avaking state. The first
observations recorded were made in the course of a political cam-
paign. Dr. d'Hotel found that the people most easily won over to
his views were those Avhose pupils dilated when he was addressing
them. When persuasion was more difficult, he observed alternate
dilatation and contraction of the pupils according as his efforts were
effective or not. Later observations on the pupils of many persons
under a variety of suggestive or persuasive influences confirmed Dr.
d'Hotel in his opinion as to the close relation existing between this
pupillary sign and mental receptivity.
At the present time there is perhaps no matter connected with
the psychology of suggestion on which it is more important to have
new observations and experiments than in regard to the conditions
which hinder or favour the action of suggestion in what are
apparently Avaking states. It is mainly in relation to psycho-thera-
peutics that the question has arisen, but a clear understanding of
the conditions which accompany or lead to suggestibility in ordinary
life is of great importance in connection with many of the problems
of psychical research. Dr. d'Hotel's paper is a welcome contribution
to a subject on which hitherto little of value has been published.
A good instance of recovery of a lost memory by means of
suggestion during hypnosis is recorded by Dr. Paul Joire in the
Revue de I' Hypnotisnie, July, 1909. M. F., an electrical engineer, had
invented an arc lamp free from certain defects which are common
to all existing arc lamps. The problem presented was difficult, and
the solution was arrived at only after much thought. Having made
148 Journal of. Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1909.
the necessary notes and drawings of his invention, M. F. laid them
aside for a time, being absorbed in other more urgent occupations.
Soon afterwards, his health broke doAvn, and he was treated for
neurasthenia by Dr. Joire. On his recovery, desiring to continue
his work on the arc lamp, he searched for the papers which he had
put away six months previous!}'. He could not find them, and
when he tried to work out the problem anew, he was unable to
solve it. He worked at it for five months without success, and
finally asked Dr. Joire to try to recover the lost memory during
hypnosis. A graphic account is given by Dr. Joire of how M. F.
in the hypnotic state was made to retrace the events of his life
back to the occasion on which he had solved the problem, and
of how the solution was again found and the original drawing
reproduced. T. W. M.

NOTICE.
In consequence of statements that have lately appeared in
several newspapers about a club to be called the International
Club for Psychical Eesearch, a number of enquiries have
reached us. We therefore desire to make it clear that—con-
trary to the suggestion conveyed by some of the newspaper
paragraphs—the proposed Club has no connection of any kind
with our Society. It has also been stated that Professor
Barrett will be the first President of the Club, but Professor
Barrett informs us that this statement is entirely groundless.

PRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.
The 29th Private Meeting of the Society for Members and
Associates only was held in the large Hall at 20 Hanover
Square, London, W., on Thursday, October 28th, 1909, at 4 p.m.;
the President, Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, in the chair.
A paper by Mr. J. G. Piddington on " Some Classical Allusions
in Mrs. Piper's Trance " was read by Miss Verrall. This
paper will, it is hoped, appear later in the Proceedings.
REMINISCENT CRYSTAL VISIONS.
The following accounts by the Rev. H. E., received by us
through Mr. F. C. Constable, relate to experiments similar to
the three recorded in the Joicrnal for November, 1908, but
carried out with other hypnotic subjects. The first account was
received by Mr. Constable on January 5th, 1908 :
152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov.,i909.
No. 4.
May 22, 1904. F. B. entranced and told to multiply 5789 by .3
at a signal, after being awaked.
On waking and seeing me look at my watch, F. B. took up a
pencil and wrote automatically :
5789
F. B. always goes on doing (when possible) the suggested act,
unless told he is only to do it once. As I forgot to mention this
to him, he started the sum a second time, thus :
3589
! (B)
10767
As soon as I saw him start (a) I said: "Now begin counting
backwards from 100." This he did. When he came to 56 he
jumped to 45, and then began to laugh and talk about the mistake
he had made. F. B. then went back to 55 and continued the
counting. It was at 56 that he began the second sum (b) with
other figures than those I gave him. In spite, however, of this
change, the (b) sum is worked correctly, proving, it seems to me,
that the reasoning is done with the waking mind, or else that the
mind in hypnosis is still capable of reasoning.
The writing was done without planchette, the pencil being simply
held in the hand. The patient was cj^uite unconscious, both of the
order and of the fact that he was writing at all. F. B. was
thoroughly occupied with the counting backwards, and with laughing
at his mistakes. He writes without taking his pencil off' the paper.
When the pencil is taken off", one figure is put on top of
another. He does the same with words. He cannot " space," as
several others can. H. E.
Mr. F. C. Constable comments on this case as follows
F. B. on counting backwards from 100 made a mistake at 56
he jumped to 45, "and then began to laugh and talk about the
mistake he had made." He was evidently counting with normal
consciousness. And at the same time that he made the above error
he also made an error in writing down 3589 instead of 5789.
I hold the coincidence in time of these two errors is of great
importance : I deny chance coincidence. There was operation of
Nov., 1909. Reminiscent Crystal Visions. 153
F. B.'s understanding both in counting and in writing : the one
error is related to the other .... and both imported a form of
conscious operation of the understanding. . . .
It appears to me that the abnormality of the case lies only in
this : that one and the same understanding was carrying on at the
same time a double operation (that of counting and writing), whereas
normally the understanding can carry on but one operation. Through
the inriuence of hypnotism, the understanding of F. B. was doing
more than it normally could do.
If this be so, we must refer the double operation of counting and
multiplying .... not to two distinct forms (supraliminal and sub-
liminal) uf consciousness, but to one form : he was consciously
carrying on two operations of his understanding—just as Julius
Caesar is said to have been able to read one subject and dictate
another, or Lord Brougham to listen to a legal argument and
write a treatise on mathematics at the same time
Herein we find, as with H. E.'s previous experiments, evidence
that hypnotism affected F. B.'s understanding in no way directly :
it only so affected the environments of his understanding that he could
do what ordinarily he could not do. There was already latent
power in F. B. to count by words and multiply by his hand : hyp-
notism rendered this latent power potent in action by freeing his
understanding from those environments which normally prevented
his carrying on the double operation.

No. 5.
J. M., aged 21, carpenter, of good average ability. Good hypnotic
subject, and good at crystal vision.
Jan. 22, 1909, 11 o'clock a.m. Sees in crystal a man in white
apron kicking a boy. Thinks boy is a grocer's assistant. Can't see
faces plainly. Man takes boy by the arm and kicks him again.
Says he does not know either boy or man. Thinks it is inside a
shop, but is not sure. Vision fades.
On questioning J. M. he cannot remember ever having seen this.
I should state that I consider he has a bad ordinary memory, and
a fairly bad memory when in the hypnotic trance, i.e. bad compared
with the ordinary run of subjects in this state. On being hypnotised
and asked where the scene took place, he replies at once that it was
five years ago when he was working with another boy—W. Q.,
under a carpenter named E. C. The boy and he had each made a
154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1909.
wheelbarrow. The carpenter, E. C, found fault with W. Q., "and
he gave him cheek, so he put his boot into him, and kicked him
over the barrow." Asked what made him see this picture, he
answered :
" I was pushing a barrow this morning."
Further asked 'what this had to do with it,' he replied: "I
thought of the new one I was making, as I was pushing the barrow."
Awake. J. M. says he remembers clearly thinking of the new
barrow he is making, and noticing the way the one was made that
he was pushing, but feels sure he never thought of W. Q. or of the
kicking affair.
It seems to me fairly obvious that the barrow J. M. was pushing
suggested the barrow he is making. His mind was idle probably,
as he was going along the road, and the incident about W. Q. rose
at least as far as his sub-conscious memory, being suggested by
barrow-makins;.
No. 6.
J. M., date, time, etc., as above.
Sees in crystal a man hanging from a beam in a room, by his
neck—small table upset on floor below him. Man about 70 years
of age. Light tweed coat, dark trousers. Rope fastened to hook in
old-fashioned whitewashed beam. Kope double. Face is to right.
Vision fades.
J. M. remembers this incident thoroughly. It haj^pened at S. in
the Midlands, on Easter Monday 1907. He was called into the
house, together with the man with whom he was lodging, to cut the
man down. The house was opposite the one in which he lodged,
where this took place.
The question now was, —what made him see this very unpleasant
vision 1 There was no need to find out further details as to what
the vision was, as he could naturally describe such an afl'air
thoroughly.
On being hypnotised, and the question being asked, he replied
"I saw them hanging up a pig [on Jan. 18th] that was just killed,
a day or two ago." "Did you think of this man when you saw
that?" "No, not that I know of." "If you saw that, a day or two
ago, why do you see it to-day in the crystal
?
" "I saw a postcard
to-day with a pig on it."
After waking, J. M. told me that while driving a cart with a
horse that went very slowly through the village of 0. on Monday
last, he saw a newly killed pig hung up to the roof of a shed that
Nov., 1909. Reminiscent Crystal Visions. 155
opened on to the road. He merely looked at it as the horse went
slowly by. As far as he knows, he never thought of the suicide
at all.
This morning i.e. Jan. 22, about half an hour before these ex-
periments—he called at B.'s house, and was shown a postcard, .sent
for a joke, showing a pig Avithout its head. Is quite sure he did
not think of the pig he saw hung up at 0.
The chain of memory is again obvious. The postcard pig suggests
the dead pig at 0, and this in turn suggests tlie suicide at S.
But these two cases seem to have a further interest. After J. M.
had seen Vision 5, I took the crystal away and wrote the notes
of the experiment. This took rather less than 10 minutes. I then
handed J. M. the crystal again. He immediately saw the No. 6
vision. Why does this one follow the other? The wheelbarrow in
No. 6 that he was pushing he stopped outside B.'s house and
went in. Here he took the postcard into his hands and examined
it. After staying there a little while, he went back to the barrow
and took it to its destination, and then came on to me for experi-
ments. Again the chain is fairly obvious. H. E.
CASE.
L. 1178. Dream.
The following case was sent to Mrs. Sidgwick by a corre-
spondent, Mrs. Arnold Shavp, who is acquainted with all the
persons concerned. We are requested to print their initials
only, but the full names and addresses have been given to us.
The percipient, Miss G. writes
December I9th, 1908.
I dreamt my married friend Mrs. L. came with her sister to me
in my room, in motor costume, in great distress. The scene seemed
to change to her morning room, and she and her sister were in
a very distressed state of mind, because her husband and a friend
had left her, or gone away—that part was very vague—but she
was so upset, and it impressed me so much, and it was all so
vivid. I telephoned first thing in the morning to see if anything
was wrong, but did not hear anything, as she was not then up
in the afternoon I heard that her husband and a friend had gone
out for an hoar's run on the motor. It had broken down, and
they had not returned till 2 a.m. in the morning, and could get
to nowhere to communicate with the wife. She meanwhile was
156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1909.
in an awful state of mind, and she has told me since that she
thought several times of telephoning to me, only the lateness of the
hour prevented her ; and she longed for me to be there.
G. G.
The following are questions asked by Mrs. Sidgwick, to
which Miss G.'s answers are appended
1. What was the date of the dream?
Just before Xmas, 1907.
2. Does the dreamer often have vivid dreams ?
Not specially.
3. Has she on any other occasion had a dream which has so im-
pressed her that she has taken steps afterwards to find
out if anything corresponding to the dream had happened ?
No.
4. Has she ever attached any significance to a dream l>efore 1
No.
5. Does she often dream of Mrs. L. 1
No. •
Mrs. L.'s account, obtained independently of Miss G.'s, was
received by Mrs. Sidgwick on January 9th, 1909, and is as
follows :
... On Sunday, December 22nd, 1907, my husband and I had intended
having a quiet day at home, when in the afternoon my brother-in-
law unexpectedly arrived with a light-powered car which he had
bought not long before, and which he wanted my husband to try.
Later on, though it was now dark, they decided to go for a run,
and arranged to call at . . . the home of my husband's sister, Mrs.
B. A friend, H. N., went with them.
My husband said he would be home by 8 o'clock, and as he keeps
his word, I knew he would do his best to be back at that time.
However, at 8 o'clock they did not return, and at a few minutes
past, Mrs. B. telephoned to say that they were staying supper,
but would leave 9 o'clock certain. She also said that the car had
been running badly and that it would give the chauffeur time to
put the engine in order. They would be home 10 o'clock by the
latest.
I seldom feel nervous, but in this case I knew the car was
not in really safe running order. When 11 o'clock, then 12 o'clock
came, and still they did not return, I at last felt certain that
Nov., 1909. Case. 157
something sei-ious must have happened. In spite of myself my
mind was filled with accidents and horrors. I was quite alone,
having sent the maids to bed long before, and every moment I
felt more frightened and helpless. I knew that something ought
to be done, that somebody ought to go after them. They might
all be lying badly injured on the road.
I did not dare to ring up Mrs. B. or my own people, who live
some miles away. It would probably have been worse than useless.
I began to long for some one to be there with me, and while won-
dering to myself which of my friends I would rather have, my
mind decided for me upon my friend G. G. As the time w^ent on,
my suspense became more and more unbearable, the silence of it all
seemed dreadful.
Between 12 and 1 o'clock, I several times almost decided to go
over to the house of our own chauffeur (about ten minutes' walk away)
wake him up, and tell him to get the car out for me to go and
find them. Over and over again I felt that I must rush upstairs
and put on a motoring veil and cap, and find my big coat. Then
I was afraid that all the village street would hear the alarm if I
went knocking loudly for the chauffeur. I also thought of callino-
up the maids to go to [the chauffeur's house]. However, soon after
1.30 I was suddenly surprised to hear some one walking up the drive,
and, on rushing to the door, I was overjoyed to see my husband
and the rest safe and sound, but absolutely tired out.
The engine had broken down miles away, and after trying for
some time to mend it up temporarily, but without success, they had
pushed the car inside somebody's drive gate for safety and had
walked all the way home.
Next morning between 9 and 10 o'clock, G. G. telephoned to me.
She asked how I was, and my maid who answered the ring replied
that I was "much better," merely thinking that G. G. was referrino"
to a bad cold that I had been suffering from the week before.
It was not until later in the day that G. G. met some of H. N.'s
people and heard what had happened.
Soon after that she told me her side of the experience, all about
her painfully vivid dream, and I have no shadow of a doubt that
she went through very anxious hours with me, and that her
thoughts were parallel with mine all through the time of dreadful
suspense.
E. L. L.
158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1909.
H. K's sister, Miss M. N., writes as follows
January \Qth, 1909.
Miss G. came to see us the Monday before Christmas, 1907,
and told us about a dream she had had the nia;ht before. The details
of the dream, as far as I can vememl)er, were that Mrs. L. had come
to her in great distress saying her husband had gone away and had
not come back. She also said that my brother had had something to
do with it. Miss G. also said that the dream so affected her,
that as soon as she came down in the morning, she had telephoned
to Mrs. L. to see if she was all right, but was not able to speak
to her.
We rather laughed at her taking any notice of a dream and
thought no more about it until my brother (who had been away for
the week-end), came in at mid-day and told us that on the Sunday
afternoon, he, Mr. L., and others had started for a motor ride,
Mr. L. telling his wife that he should not be away long ; he
expected to be back about 7 o'clock. All went well till they were
coming back, when about twelve miles away from home something
went wrong with the car, and after vainly trying to put it right,
they started to walk home, and did not arrive till about 2 o'clock
in the morning, finding Mrs. L. naturally in a great state of
alarm. During Monday afternoon I happened to meet Miss G.
and told her of the accident, and we remarked that it must account
for her dream, as Mrs. L. must have been worrying just about
the time she was dreaming of her. I heard later on that Mrs.
L. was actually intending to telephone to Miss G. to ask her
what to do, if they hadn't turned up when they did. This is, as
near as I can remember, all that occurred.

OBITUARY.
Professor Cesare Lombroso.
[We regret to have to record the death of Professor Cesare
Lombroso, for twenty years a Corresponding Member of our
Society, who died of heart failure at Turin on October 19th, after
a few days' illness. The following notice is quoted, with the
permission of the Editor, from the British Medical Journal :]
Professor Lombroso was born at Verona in 183-5, studied medicine
at Padua, and afterwards at Vienna, where he came especially under
the influence of Skoda. He graduated at Padua in 1856. He served
Nov., 1909. Obituary. 159
as a surgeon in the Austro-Italian war, which broke out in 1859. Some
years later he was appointed Professor of Psychiatry in the University
of Pavia. One of his earliest works was a volume of researches on
cretinism, which was published in 1S58. He made original observations
on pellagra, the results of which were embodied in a monograph
published in 1872. He followed this up with a memoir on the poisons
of maize. 1
Later he was appointed to the chair of psychiatry in the University
of Turin. From the beffinnin<r of his teachini!' career he had been
interested in the relations of nervous disease and crime, and he pursued
his researches and observations at Turin. These were published in his
well-known work, L' Uomo Delinquente, which appeared in 1889. After-
wards he applied himself to the study of genius, which he held to be a
form of nervous disease. He became celebrated as the founder of a
school of criminal anthropology, the doctrines of which were pushed by
some of his disciples to extreme consec|uences that brought his teaching
into undeserved derision. He was a shrewd observer, and a most
industrious collector of facts from all sources j but his notions of
evidence were very loose, and he lacked the power of presenting his
views in logical order. But to him belongs the credit of being a pioneer
in a new region of scientific thought, and though much of his work was
fantastic and inaccurate, he gave a stimulus to other investigators, which
will probably lead to fruitful results. Of him it might, we think, be
said, as it was said of the old Spanish exploder of popular superstitions
—Feyjoo, that a statue should be raised to him, at the foot of which his
own writings should be burnt.
THE SIXTH INTEENATIONAL CONGEESS OF
PSYCHOLOGY.
The sixth International Congress of Psychology was held at
Geneva from August 3rd to August 7th under the presidency of
Professor Th. Flournoy. The number of members was very
large, though but few came from this country. The number of
papers read was small as compared with those of the foregoing
Congress ; this was due to the adoption of the plan of keeping the
members together in general session as much as possible. The
papers and discussions maintained a high level of interest without
'It may be added that it was due to Professor Lombroso's strenuous and
persistent efforts, extending over a number of years, that legislation affecting the
causes of pellagra was promoted, which virtually put a stop to the disease. Ed.

minute specialisation ; and the many entertainments generously
offered by the local organisation and members contributed to
render the meeting very enjoyable. It was resolved that the
next congress should be held in the United States in the year
1913. From the point of view^ of the S.P.E. the most
important feature of the Congress was perhaps the reading of
a paper by Dr. Sidney Alrutz, in which he described experiments
on the production of movements of a registering apparatus (some-
what on the lines of Sir Wm. Crookes's well-known experiments
with Home) in mechanically inexplicable fashion. The experiments
seem to have been successful with several private mediums. The
paper was well received, and it was noticeable that the tone of
the Congress seemed favourable to " psychical research." There
was an important discussion on " subconsciousness," in the course
of which Dr. Morton Prince gave some account of a new case
similar to, but, if possible, even more interesting than the one he
has made so widely known. W, M'D.
OCCASIONAL UNEXPLAINED RINGING OF
HOUSE-BELLS.
By Sir Olr-er Lodge.^
An observation sent me by Mr. Alexander Sinclair of
Swansea, to the effect that during a thunderstorm drops of
water leaking through the ceiling " assumed a pear shape and
jumped 9 inches almost horizontally to the curtain rings
above the window," suggests that house-bells of the ordinary
non-electric type may occasionally be rung by this means. I
picture the process as follows :
—The bell-wires collect atmos-
pheric electricity, by induction or otherwise, which the walls
are insufficiently conducting to carry off freely ;
consequently
the bells get charged, are attracted to a neighbouring wall or
pipe and released suddenly by a spark. This little lateral
jerk rings the belL
I put the simple suggestion on record because I sometimes
hear of an inclination to attribute the phenomenon to less
familiar causes.
p.^_To this I add:
Other normal causes have been suggested, such as the
mechanical sticking of a wire and its sudden casual release.

CORRESPONDENCE.
On Prof. Pigou's Criticism of Cross-Correspondences.
I.
In the last issue of the Journal Sir Oliver Lodge prints a short
comment on my criticism of cross-correspondences in the recent
Proceedings. I should like to be allowed a few words of rejoinder
or perhaps it would be better to say of explanation, because, if I
could accept Sir Oliver Lodge's interpretation of my argument, I
should also endorse his criticism. I did not maintain that "just
as the former {i.e. the Verrall script) originated wholly in sub-
liminal activities, so also the latter (Myers) script, must probably
have originated so likewise." This, of course, would be invalid,
for, as Sir Oliver Lodge rightly points out, the Verrall script did
not originate in subliminal activities, but in Dr. Verrall's conscious
purpose. The argument which I intended to state, and which,
perhaps from an author's natural prejudice, I cannot help believing
that I did state, was more complicated. From the Verrall script
I inferred, not that a complementary correspondence, but. that the com-
plementary element in a complementary correspondence, can originate in
subliminal activity. This seems to me to be correct, since it is
clear that the complementary relation between Mrs. Verrall's different
scripts formed no part of Dr. Verrall's intention. On the basis
of this inference I argued that a complementary correspondence
afifords no more evidence of non-subliminal agency than is afforded
by a simple correspondence. If this be so, the evidential value, not
of complementary correspondences, but of the complementary element
in complementary correspondences, is destroyed ; and we have
merely to consider whether the appearance of simple correspondences
makes probable the activity of dis-carnate intelligences. My negative
answer to this second question was based, not on the Verrall script,
but on the experiments of Miss Ramsden and Miss Miles discussed
on p. 293 of my paper ; and it was supported by reference to Miss
Johnson's opinion which I quote on the succeeding page.
A. C. PiGOU.
II.
I am glad to understand more clearly the precise meaning of
Professor Pigou, and I think that other readers of the Proceedings
may be similarly assisted by his present communication. The
162 Journal of Society for PsychAcal Research.. Nov., 1909.
advantage of these friendly discussions is that they tend to elucidate
little intricacies in what is virtually a new kind of study.
The Editor of the Journal has suggested to me that it is probably
necessary to discriminate between "accidental fragments" and "com-
plementary factors." The disjecta membra of a really good cross-
correspondence are complementary rather than fragmentar}', and
their separation exhibits signs of purpose. At least that is what
the evidence seems to point to, though that may be a matter for
discussion. But the fragments of the " One horse dawn " episode
are nothing more than fragmentary, and their separation, as Professor
Pigou remarks, seems to be unavoidable rather than intended. The
incident would probably have been given as a whole, had it been
possible. There was no advantage in breaking it up, since it all
came through one person. But in the case of a cross-correspondence
between different autoniatists there is every advantage, from the
evidential point of view, in breaking the communication up into
complementary portions which are separately unintelligible.
If it be true that the accidentally fragmentary and the purposive
complementary can be discriminated ; and if the discrimination is
applicable, as I have tentatively suggested, say to the " One horse
dawn" case on the one hand, and the "Browning Hope and Star"
case on the other; then there is a distinction (which, when answering
Professor Pigou before, I confess I had not noticed) between the
two cases to which he refers.
If the distinction thus suggested is real, then the absence of
intention in producing the " fragments " of the one case does not
prove, and need not necessarily imply, the absence of intention in
producing the "complements" in the other.
The question can, however, only be settled by a careful study
and analysis of the characteristics of a number of cases ; and further
material for this will, I hope, be afforded before long by the later
scripts of Mrs. Piper, Mrs. and Miss Verrall, and Mrs. Holland,
reports on which are now being prepared for publication.

REVIEW.
The Religious Attitude ami Life in Islam, being the Haskell Lectures on
Comparative Beligion, 11)06. By D. B. Macdonald, M.A., B D.
Chicago University Press, 1909. Post 8vo, pp. 317.
These lectures, ten in number, are, to quote the author's preface,
"an attempt to outline the religious attitude and life of Muslims,
Nov., 1909. Revieiv. 3 63
as opposed to the systematic theology of Islam." The authorities
chiefly relied upon are Ibn Khaldun, " part statesman, part scholar,
part lawyer," who died at Cairo in 140G, and al-Ghazzali, who died
in 1111 ; and lengthy extracts from the works of these two Avriters
form a considerable portion of the volume.
Mr. Macdonald's book is primarily a study in comparative religion,
and it is a valuable contribution to the literature on that subject
but the reader soon discovers, not without surprise, that its contents
are calculated to appeal to those interested in such matters as the
S.P.E. exists to investigate, no less than to the student of religions.
This will be seen at once from an enumeration of some of the
subjects of Muslim belief discussed by the Arabic authors. The Muslim
believes that the veil which separates him from the unseen world,
in which dwells the Almighty, and which is peopled by angels and
spirits {Jinn), good and evil, is of the very thinnest, and that it can
be, and often is, pierced by man. All men may hold communion
with God through prayer and meditation, but to some it is given
to have intercourse with the spirit-world by other means also. The
soul of the prophet passes through the veil in his trance, and
receives the revelation of the divine will from messengers of the
All-Hol}-. The Kahin, who is both poet and soothsayer (rates),
receives his inspirations in a similar manner. Wizardry and magic
(the phenomena of which include telekinesis), and 'scrying' with
mirrors, bowls of water, and other media, are practised, and are
features of the religious life. In these practices, as also in
divination by dreams and through the insane ('possession' and
'
automatic speech ') the Muslim believes the phenomena to be pro-
duced, or at least their production assisted, by denizens of the
spirit-world, some good, some evil, with whom he has brought him-
self into touch. Such, among others, are the subjects dealt with at
length by Ibn Khaldun and al-Ghazzali, and it is clear from their
writings that they are part of the very marrow of the Muslim
faith. Mr. Macdonald states an obvious truth, therefore, when he
says, "It was necessary, in the search for interpretative analogies, to
turn, not to our metaphysical systems or to our religious philosophy,
but rather to what we call commonly, in jest or earnest, the
occult. These analogies, therefore, had to be sought chiefly in the
Proceedings of the Society/ for Psychical Research and similar publi-
cations. The case of Muhammad himself, for example, can be
indefinitely more completely illustrated and explained by the
phenomena of so-called trance-mediumship than by any other
164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1909.
hypothesis." He goes on to add, "And it is noteworthy, further,
that the theory of veridical hallucinations worked out by Gurney
and Myers is essentially that of al-Ghazzali and Ibn Khaldun."
The following is a quotation from Il)n Khaldun ; he declares that
he has seen "another body" influenced in the way he describes.
"The philosophers distinguish between magic and tab'smans, but
they lay it down that both together are due to an influence be-
longing to the human soul. They give as a proof of this influence
how the soul afl'ects the body apart from the ordinary operations
of nature or physical causes—nay, there are effects which arise
from spiritual conditions, such as heat caused by joy, or from
ideas, such as those which result from fear. One who is walking
upon the edge of a wall, or upon a tight-rope, when fear of falling
comes strongly upon him, will most certainly fall. Only by long
practice can the fear of falling be removed, and then such walk
safely. If, then, the soul has this influence upon its own body,
without physical natural causes, it is probable that it can have a
similar infliuence upon another body, since its relationship to
bodies in this kind of influence is one ; for it is not enfolded in
the body or shut up in it. So it follows that it can exert an
influence upon all material objects."
Mr. Macdonald's comment is, "This, you will notice, is precisely
the theory which lies behind the '
mental science ' and '
Christian
science ' of our own day. It is also practically involved in the
infinitely more scientific '
metapsychical,' to use Dr. Maxwell's word,^
investigations which are now going on. There lies in it an indubit-
able element of truth."
Mr. Macdonald's work shows that he is thoroughly at home with
his subject ; his exposition is clear, and his comments lively and
informing. He has produced a book which I venture to think will
prove of interest to many members of the S.P.R. '

NOTICE.
In consequence of statements that have lately appeared in several
newspapers about a club to be called the International Club for
Psychical Research, a number of enquiries have reached us. We
therefore desire to make it clear that —contrary to the suggestion
conveyed by some of the newspaper paragraphs—the proposed Club
has no connection of any kind with our Society. It has also been
stated that Professor Barrett will be the first President of the Club,
but Professor Barrett informs us that this statement is entirely
groundless. '

ADDITIONAL INFOEMATION ABOUT CASE G. 283.
The Jotmial for May, 1908 (pp. 228-234), contains an
account, which had previously been read by Professor Barrett
at a private meeting of the Society held on March 30th,
1908, of an apparition seen shortly after the death of the
person represented by it. The percipient. Miss " Minnie
Wilson," being at the time in a convent school in Belgium,
stated that she saw^ on June 1st, 1907, an apparition of her
godfather, " Captain Oldham," who informed her that he had
taken his own life because a lady had refused to marry him.
A few days later she heard from her mother that he had
died suddenly on May 29th, 1907, and, on coming home on
Aug. 6 th, asked her mother if the information given her by
the apparition was correct, and learnt that it was so.
When the case was printed. Professor Barrett had had no
opportunity of making enquiries at the Convent or of obtaining
from there tlie corroborative evidence which was required to
complete the ease. Eecently an Associate of the Society, Miss
F. M. Charlton, at Professor Ban-ett's request, kindly imdertook
to visit Belgium and caiTy out these enquiries, for which
purpose he put all the documents into her hands.
Miss Charlton spent several days in the neighbourhood of
the Convent and found the nuns, whom she visited daily, ready
and willing to give her all possible help in her enquiries even
into the most minute details. Unfortunately, however, very
little corroboration was obtainable, and some distinct inaccuracies
in the details of Miss Wilson's account revealed themselves.
(1) Prom some letters written by Mrs. Wilson in September,
1907, it appears that her daughter told her she had been in
the church with a nun named Mere Paule when she saw
the apparition, and that she told Mere Paule about it in
confidence, but did not tell her the subsequent news, received
from her mother, of Captain Oldham's death. Writing on
February 20th, 1908, Mrs. Wilson says that her daughter
" only confided in old Mere Columba . . . and after my letter
arrived, said :
'
You see. Mere, he is dead.' " On the dis-
crepancy being pointed out, Mrs. Wilson writes (March 15th,
1908): "It was a clerical error on my part using Mere
Dec, 1909. Additional Information ahoid Case G. 283. 167
Paule's name instead of Mere Columba's," and Miss Wilson,
in her own narrative (printed in the Journal for May, 1908,
p. 232), says that she was with Mere Cohimba in the church
when she saw the apparition, and that she told her about it.
Miss Charlton has ascertained that Mere Columba could not
have been in the church, as she was bed-ridden at the time
it was probably Mere Paule who was there, she being the
sacristan. Mere Paule, however, denies that Miss Wilson ever
told her anything about the apparition (see statements below),
and Mere Columba having died since, no confirmation can be
obtained from her of Miss Wilson's statement that she told her
of it.
(2) The original account says that Miss Wilson first saw
one of her school friends, whom she knew to be away at the
time, coming towards her in nun's dress, and that this young
nun led her in her vision through the Nuns' Eefectory, where
no one of the girls is allowed to go, and thence into their
private chapel, where she saw the apparition of her godfather
and that on her way through the refectory she saw a curious
picture which she had never seen before. It appeared to have
pieces of red tape hanging from a figure in it. She stated
that it was the custom for the girls who got prizes to go
into the refectory to receive them at the end of their last
term at school, and that when she went there, two months
after the vision, she recognised this picture—the picture of a
saint dripping with blood—on the wall.
Miss Charlton has, however, found that the picture in ques-
tion is not in the refectory, but in the nuns' Chapter-Koom
that the girls never under any circumstances go into the
refectory, but some of the older girls are admitted once a
year to the Chapter-Eoom to walk in a procession that takes
place there on March 19th, and it appears that Miss Wilson
had been there on March 19th, 1907, and therefore had
had every opportunity of seeing the picture several weeks
before the date of her vision.
These somewhat serious vaguenesses and inaccuracies in
Miss Wilson's account show that her memory is not altogether
to be relied on, and it is the more unfortunate that no con-
firmation is now obtainable of her having mentioned the vision
at the time of its occurrence and before Captain Oldham's
168 Journal of Society for Psychical Researcli. Dec.,1909.
death was known to her. We cannot, of course, doubt that
she had some unusual experience, nor that the news of his
death greatly affected her, nor that she saw visions of him.
And that she spoke of her experience to Mere Columba seems
probable, both from her own recollection and from what Mere
Columba's sister says (see below). But evidentially the important
question is whether the first of the series of visions occurred
before she had heard of the death ; and this is a point on
which, during the weeks when the vision was recurring, her
memory might easily have become confused.
Even supposing, however, that no apparition was seen until
after Miss Wilsoia had heard of the death, the important fact
remains that, as testified to by Mrs. Wilson, she asked her
mother on first coniing home whether it was not true that
her godfather had committed suicide because a lady liad
refused to marry him, which facts her mother had taken
particular pains to conceal from her.
Mrs. Wilson's first and most explicit statement on this
point, in a letter dated September 4th, 1907, is: "It was
my earnest desire that [Minnie] should never know the cir-
cumstances under which her Uncle •
(as she always
called him) met his death, so I never mentioned anything
about him till the Tuesday following, in my usual weekly
letter. My few words were :
'
I have very sad news for
you ! Poor Uncle died suddenly on Wednesday and
was buried on Saturday.'
In estimating the evidence it must not be overlooked that
in some cases the very reticence as to the cause of death
might lead to a correct inference ; but whether this could have
occurred in the present case, it is now impossible to say.
In sending her report of the case, Miss Charlton writes
With every intention, evidently, of telHng the truth, Minnie does
not seem to have had a good memory, or even to have been very
observant of facts at the time. She confounded Mere Paule with
Mere Columba, and the Nuns' Refectory with their Chapter Room.
She did not even know the surname of one of her friends, and
spoke of the elder girls receiving prizes in the Nuns' Refectory,
when the incident referred to was really a procession in the Chapter
Room. She said that the girls of different nationalities were kept

apart, whereas nothing separates them but the fact that at first
the Flemish girls cannot understand the English language, and,
as a matter of fact, it seems that one of the Belgian girls was
the recipient of [Minnie's] confidences [on another subject] before
she left.
But the gravest inaccuracy in her account and that which most
seriously affects the evidence is the statement that she had not seen
the picture Avith the "red tape" before her vision, Avhereas it is
certain that she had seen it beforehand. It is also disappointing
that we have not been able to get an explanation of the fact that
she first said that Mere Paule had been with her when she saw the
apparition ; but after the case had begun to be investigated and
Mere Columba had died, shifted her statement and said it was Mere
Columba who had been with her, whereas Mere Columba, who was
her class-mistress, had been bed-ridden and away from her class for
five months, and had never been accustomed to dust the church at
any time.
I think that the notion that she had become acquainted with her
godfather's suicide and the reason for it through the ordinary
channels of knowledge, cannot be entertained for a moment. The
girls never see any newspapers, and no one in the Convent seems
to have known even of her friend's existence.
The signed statements of the nuns, obtained by Miss
Cliarlton, are as follows :

dusting the statues in the Church, and very probably did so on the
morning of June 1st, 1907, though I have nothing to mark the

the extraordinary experience in question to me. I should certainly
have remembered it had she done so.

aged 48. She came down about five times during the interval, but

only to be drawn in a bath-chair about the garden or to see the
girls of her class-room, of which [Minnie Wilson] was one. [Minnie]
liked Mere Columba, and was pretty intimate with her. I am con-
vinced in my own mind, from certain indications, that [Minnie] did
confide something mysterious to my sister. I knew [Minnie Wilson]
very well myself. She was a very thoughtful girl, and used often
to go of her own accord in the evening to the Nuns' Chapel to
follow the Stations of the Cross by herself.
I recognize the remarks which [Minnie] states Mere Columba
made when she told her of her vision as being characteristic of
my sister.
With regard to the girl called "Marie" I have made careful
inquiries, and find that none of [Minnie's] companions of that name
who subsequently became Nuns left until Easter, 1907, when Marie
left, returning in Sept., 1907, when she and two other
"Maries" took the Postulant's cap and became Novices in Nov.
They all knew [Minnie], but none of them connects her with any
psychic experience. One of them, Marie , was an intimate
friend of hers, and helped her to pack before she left. [Minnie] at
that time told her how anxious she was to come back. . . . She was
of course aware all along of her friend's intention to enter religion,
and must certainly have known about the two other Maries as well.
Mere M. Anastasie.
Statement of Mere Ambroisine.
I am Head Mistress of the English, and as such have had a great
deal to do with [Minnie Wilson] while she was an inmate of this
Convent for two years. . . . [Minnie's] statement that before leaving
school she was taken into the Nuns' Refectory for the first time,
and there recognized the picture of her vision, is manifestly
incorrect. She could never have been inside the Nuns' Refectory
at any time, and moreover there is no picture there which at
all corresponds to the one she describes ; but it is a very good
impressionist description of an extremely badly painted attempt
to represent St. Francis of Assisi receiving the stigmata, which
hangs just inside the door of the Chapter-room. Into that room some
of the older girls are admitted, as a reward for their good behaviour,
once a year, to walk in a procession. This takes place at 7 o'clock
on the evening of March 19 (the Feast of St. Joseph), and that is
the only occasion when [Minnie] could have been inside that room,
i.e. March 19, 1907, and she was certainly present on that occasion.
Dec, 1TO9. Additional Information about Case 283. in
It may be worth while to mention a fact which was first recalled
to me by Mere Anastasie in Miss Charlton's presence, i.e. that on
the evening of May 31, 1907 (the night before the vision), the
Feast of St. Angela was celebrated by the girls acting in a play
which was founded on her life, and that several of [Minnie's]
school companions were acting in it dressed up as Nuns.
M^RE M. Ambroisine.
In regard to these statements Miss Charlton adds
Mere Anastasie, who signs second, is teacher of Music and
Arithmetic. She was in Johannesburg all through the Boer War,
but her martial experiences have left her extremely gentle and
uninsistent in her opinions, excepting where the question of truth
is concerned, about which she is remarkably scrupulous. I had to
write her statement over again, because she thought I had not
given quite the proper shade of value to a quite unimportant
matter. I never have known any one weigh her words so much, and
this I think is important in view of her having said that she was
convinced in her own mind that [Minnie] had spoken to her sister
Mere Columba about the apparition. When we all five had made
up our minds that [Minnie] must have been right when she said
it was to Mere Columba to whom she had confided her secret,
Mere Anastasie said: "That accounts for the curious expression that
always came over my sister's face whenever I spoke to her of
[Minnie Wilson] !
" . . . I questioned her afterwards about it, and she
said with the utmost earnestness :
" Yes, indeed, Miss Charlton, it
is true. I always used to notice such an odd smile on Mere
Columba's face whenever I talked to her about [Minnie], a kind
of—not exactly mocking, but a sceptical smile. I never could under-
stand what it meant, but as soon as I heard this story it flashed
upon me ; but I hope the Society won't imagine from this that
my sister couldn't keep a secret, for her smile conveyed absolutely
nothing to me until I heard all this, when I understood it."
This I am confident is the exact truth, and I think we may feel
quite satisfied that [Minnie] was correct when she said it was to
Mere Columba she had confided her experience.
Mere Ambroisine's final statement, that the evening before [Minnie]
saw, in her trancs condition, her former school companion, dressed as
a Nun, she was looking on at or taking part in a play in which
some of her school companions were dressed up as Nuns, seems to
nie of considerable importance.
172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1909.
I was taken all over that part of the Convent represente 1 in the
sketch,^ and have traced with black ink the way that [Minnie] must
have gone on March 19th, 1907, when she walked in a procession
which formed up in the schools and terminated in the Chapter-
room. The girls marched through the door, and deposited their
banners against the opposite wall, when they would naturally face
round and have the picture of St. Francis receiving the Stigmata
right before them. This picture represents a small crucifix floating
sideways in the air, with straight lines which look exactly like red
tape proceeding from the hands, feet, and side, and striking the
Saint, who is kneeling at some distance off. It is an extremely ill-
painted and grotesque picture, and one that no one would be likely
ever to forget. ... . Frances M. Charlton.
Miss Charlton sends us a small water-colour copy of the oil
painting referred to, which bears out precisely the description
she has given. The red lines proceeding from the crucifix to the
Saint are a very conspicuous feature in it. She adds that she
has received a later letter from Mere Ambroisine, in which the
latter mentioned a second occasion, namely, on May 1st, 1907,
when Miss Wilson is known to have been inside the Chapter-
room, where the picture hangs.
THE EEPOET ON EUSAPIA PALLADINO.
1.
I HAVE read with extreme interest the Eeport of the Com-
mittee appointed to investigate the phenomena presented by
Eusapia Palladino. My first impression, some weeks back,
after reading the Eeport and a great part of the evidence, was
that now at last we had the issue fairly and squarely pre-
sented—that we had in fact, as the Committee themselves
put it, to choose between the alternatives of a new force and
collective hallucination. So strong was the impression produced
on me that I wrote to Mr. Feilding (but the letter did not
unfortunately reach him before his departure for the Congo)
urging less cavalier treatment of the hypothesis of collective
hallucination.
sketch of part of the Convent was included in Miss Charlton's report,
but is not reproduced here.
Dec, 1909. The Report on Eusa-pia Palludino. 173
A few clays ago I had occasion to make a more careful
study of the evidence, and in the course of my further reading
some suspicions circumstances came to light, which led me to
make a still closer analysis. To analyse with care the whole
mass of evidence would be an extremely laborious under-
taking. There are only five completely successful seances
seances, that is, which include the whole range of phenomena,
from tilts of the table to phantom heads—viz. V., VI., VII.,
VIII., and XL But at seance VIII. and XL, except for an
unproductive hour at the beginning of seance VIII., one side
of Eusapia was under the control of a visitor. Seances V.,
VI., and VII. represent therefore at once the high-water mark
of the phenomena and the best conditions of control. Through-
out these three seances both Eusapia's hands and feet were
under control of the members of the Committee—Mr. Feildincf,
Mr. Baggally, and Mr. Carrington. My analysis has therefore
been in the main confined to these three sittings. But from
a cursory examination I see no reason to doubt that the
criticism made on these seances will apply mutatis mutandis
to all the rest.
Two conclusions at once emerged from this closer analysis.
(1) That Eusapia is afraid of Mr. Carrington. Twice in the
course of these seances he was, by Eusapia's request, displaced
from the control of the right side ; so that, in fact, save for two
brief and unproductive intervals at the beginning of seances
V. and VII. respectively, he was not allowed, during these
three seances, to sit at Eusapia's right. (2) That at these
three seances, as a rule, she preferred to make use of her
right limbs. Whether this performance is characteristic of her
stances generally I am unable to say ; but the Committee of
the Institut Ghi6ml Psychologique reported that Eusapia suffered
from a painful corn on her right foot, which rendered her
intolerant of the more effective control of that foot, viz. by
placing it under the foot of the controller.
At any rate, setting aside the simpler and commoner phe-
nomena—levitation of tables, bulging of medium's dress,
movements of curtains, thumps and raps—which are so
diiJicult to isolate as not in any case to afford a crucial test
—I challenge the Committee to point to a single phenomenon
(grasp of the hand, transportation of object from cabinet, or
174 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1909.
appearance of head, hand, or other similar object) presented
at these three seances which could not be explained on the
assumption that Eusapia succeeded in" freeing the right hand,
or possibly, in some instances, the right foot.
If this be admitted—and the statement can easily be
verified—it is all important to know the exact condition of
the control exercised on the right hand.
(1) Throughout these three seances, whereas Eusapia's left
hand is generally reported as lying in or being held or grasped
by the hand of the controller on that side, the right hand as
a rule is reported as resting on or lying on, or lying under,
the other controller's left hand. The difference, in view of
Eusapia's known propensities for cheating by substitution of
hands, is important.
(2) It happens unfortunately that while the control of the
left hand is generally stated precisely e.g. " left hand held in
my right visibly on the table "—that of the right is often
stated in general terms, such as " Control perfect," or " Control
as before." Frequently at the critical moment the statement
is incomplete. Sometimes no statement at all is forthcoming.
(3) On many occasions it is reported that the right-hand
curtain has blown out over the controller on that side so as
to cover his head, or his hand in contact with Eusapia's right.
Thus at V. 10.57 the right-hand controller reports: "The
curtain is blown over my head"; at 10.58 "The curtain
is still over my hand." No further statement on the subject
is made until 11.56, when Eusapia's right hand is reported
as visible. In the meantime several phenomena had happened,
and from certain indications it is probable that Eusapia's
right hand was under the curtain during their progress (read
carefully e.g. levitation of table at 11.26 p.m.). In seance
VI. the right-hand curtain blows out over the arm of the
•controller on that side at ll,o5. At 12.11 Eusapia places
the curtain between her right hand and the controller's left.
At 12.50 (or thereabouts) Eusapia's right hand is again under
the curtain—but it has not been there continuously, and
we are not told when and how it got there again. At VII.
11.17 the controller on the right reports: "Her right hand
in my left hand is under the curtain." There it appears to
Jiave remained throughout the transportation of the bell and the
Dec, 1909. The Report on Eusapia PaUadino. 175
next incidents—and may have remained there until the close
of the sitting, so far as we can gather from the controller's
statements. The controllers on Eusapia's left side were not
once embarrassed in this manner by the curtain during their
three seances.
(4) Eusapia is reported as occasionally releasing one hand
momentarily and replacing it. This procedure is not reserved
exclusively for the right hand. In seance V., for instance
(10.44J and 11.36 p.m.), her left hand is twice released.
But her right hand is released more frequently and to more
purpose (see e.g. VI. 12.4, 12.30; VII. 10.54). On each of
these occasions after control is renewed it is found that both
Eusapia's hands are on her knees, the right hand lying on
the hand of the controller on that side, the left hand held by
the other controller. These, of course, are Eusapia's usual
preliminaries for substitution of hands. And on each of these
three occasions the release of the hand was followed, in a few
minutes, by the appearance of a " head " or nondescript object
from between the curtains. At VI. 11.40 (about) the release of
the right hand is followed as usual by a nondescript
appearance from between the curtains, but the right hand
is reported on the table, under the curtain.
If the reader wishes to verify these statements let him
study closely the sequence of events in seance VII. 10.54
to end, and let him endeavour from the record to make out
the exact nature of the control exercised on Eusapia's right
hand at each point, its position, whether on the table or in
her lap, and whether or not it was held under the curtain.
The defects of control, it will be found, culminated in this
seance. So did the phenomena.
In the Committee's view the hypothesis of sense-deception
compels us to assume a concurrent and concordant hallucination
of sight and touch on the part of two or more witnesses. The
above considerations suggest that, for the three most successful
test seances at any rate, all that we need assume is the
deception of a single person and a single sense—and that the
sense of touch.
In conclusion, let me offer an apology to the Committee.
I am very far from imputing negligence or incompetence to
them. I am inclined to think that most of us would have
176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1909.
failed more conspicuously. The Eeport is valuable primarily
because it is a recluctio ad absurchtm of this method of investi-
gation. It has been tried under the most favourable conditions
with investigators second to none in their qualifications, whose
practical experience is probably unrivalled, and it has failed.
The investigators, in short, set themselves a task which is
almost beyond the limit of human faculties.
Henceforth if Eusapia will have nothing to do with smoke-
blackened letter scales, or commutator keys and manometers
in securely closed boxes, we had better leave her severely alone.

I MAY, perhaps, be permitted at the outset to express my admira-
tion for the form of this minute and laborious report. The most
insignificant details appear to be recorded, so that the reader has
before him the fullest evidence possible on which to form an
opinion.
But certain doubts have arisen in my mind which may be worth
consideration.
(1) Why are the phenomena all of such a nature that fraud on
the ])art of the medium might be an explanation]
(2) If precautions might have been taken to prevent the
possibility of fraud, why were these precautions not
taken ?
Under the particular circumstances which existed when the
seances were held, it is, probably, impossible to suggest precau-
tions more stringent against fraud than those which were taken.
The observers were picked men, on the evidence of whose senses,
I think, we may rely as fully as on those of our own, and the
means taken at all times to control movements on the part of the
medium were heroic in kind.
But still the possibility of fraud appears to have always been
present in the minds of the observers, and, as I read the report,
their main reliance in believing that there was no fraud, is based on
their conviction that their control was so stringent that fraud was
impossible. That is, the phenomena themselves were not of such a
nature that, in themselves, they removed the possibility of fraud
it is to the certainty the observers felt that their control pre-
vented fraud, that their belief in the abnormal nature of the
phenomena is to be traced.
Dec. 1909. The Report on Eusa'pia Palladivo. 177
Turning now to the question of precautions that might have been
taken to prevent fraud, let us assume that Eusapia has all the
abnormal powers which it is alleged she has.
If this be so, then :
—(1) she can cause the levitation of a table
without touching it ; (2) she can make objects at a distance from
her move without physical contact ; (3) she can —and this is the
most important fact of all —make objects move when a material
curtain is interposed between her and the objects she causes to move.
Why should she not be able to make manifest all the said
phenomena when she is tinder no human control at all, but simply
placed at her ease in a cage of the same material as that of the
curtain, the interposition of which between her and certain objects
did not prevent her from causing them to move?
The belief of Mr. Feilding, Mr. Baggally, and Mr. Hereward
C'arrington in the abnormality of these phenomena appears to be
based on assurance that their control was perfect. If the experi-
ment I suggest were carried out, the question of reliance on human
control would be eliminated ; for we should have the material
control of the cage. All that would be required would be the
same careful observation.
The suggestion for the material control of the medium which I
make is not original : it was tirst formulated in Light} And it
may be there is some fundamental objection to its being carried
out. But surely some form of material—as opposed to human
control is possible 1 If not, it is to be feared we can never arrive
at scientific proof of the objectivity of the phenomena in question ;
for so long as the control is human, the possibility must always
exist that the normal senses of the observers have been deceived.
- F. C. Constable.
1 A similar suggestion was made when Eusapia came to Cambridge in 1895.
It was then proposed that a close-meshed networli should he stretched across an
open doorway, being fastened securely to the woodwork all the way round, and
that Eusapia should be placed on one side of the net, the objects to be moved
being on the other side. But Eusapia refused absolutely to submit to any such
test. For its evidential value, it would, of course, be necessary that it should be
carried out in a good light. This, on the evidence, ought to be no bar to success,
for the Naples report states explicitly that " it was on the nights when . . . our
precautions were most complete and the light the strongest that the phenomena
were the most numerous" [Proceedings, Part LIX, p. 323). Ed.

The Survival of Man. By Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S. Methuen & Co.,
London, 1909. Demy 8vo, pp. 344. 7s. 6d. net.
Throughout the twenty-eight years of its existence our Society has
been fortunate in having had placed at its disposal the voluntary
services of a series of highly trained and expert investigators, and
almost equally so in the fact that these volunteers have not only
been gifted with great patience and astuteness in observation and
experiment, but quite equally so in the faculty of lucid exposition of
the results of their labours. The latest example of this combination
of gifts not always found in association is before us in Sir Oliver
Lodge's recent publication The Survival (f Man.
It is not easy within the limits of a necessarily brief notice to
summarise the contents and characteristics of a work so compact as
this ;
one, moreover, which touches questions of physics, physiology,
and psychology, and which will be deemed by many to have an
important bearing on theology and on some of the abstruse con-
ceptions of metaphysics. The task is scarcely rendered easier by the
fact that the reviewer finds himself in almost complete accord with
the author in his methods and conclusions.
Within the space of about 350 pages Sir Oliver Lodge presents
to us an epitome of the evidence bearing on his subject matter which
the Society has been diligently collecting for a quarter of a century,
and which is scattered over thousands of pages of its Proceedings
and Journals, together with other evidence not, so far as I am aware,
before published. This in itself will be of incalculable value to the
many amongst our members, who, however keen their interest, can
scarcely find the time necessary to examine so great a mass of matter
as appears in our publications. It is of special value to those newly
entering upon a study of our Society's work, who, from want of
previous knowledge of the subject, may at times be somewhat
mystified by the contents of articles and papers which assume an
acquaintance with the methods pursued, and with a terminology
unfamiliar to those who have not closely followed our investigations
in their development. But it would be doing scant justice to Sir
Oliver's work to represent it as a mere epitome of evidence, however
well selected and arranged. It is far more than this. A weak,
irresolute judge will sometimes sum up the evidence in a case for
the jury, throwing on them the entire responsibility of forming their
own conclusions from a complicated mass of statements. A strong
judge will go further and give to the jury such assistance as can be
rendered by a trained mind and accumulated experience. Assistance

of this nature is given us in the work before us. There is a
synthesis of evidence ; there is an abundance of highly suggestive
illustration ; and there is, further, a clear presentation of the relation
to each other of the collected facts ; and lastly a lucid exposition of
the conclusion to which they seem to point.
A olance at the Table of Contents will make this clear. Section I.
briefly refers to the origin and practical work of the Society.
Section II. sets before us admirably chosen illustrations of the early
experiments in thought-transference and telepathy. Section III.
similarly deals with spontaneous telepathy, clairvoyance and prevision
or precognition, adding some ingenious illustrations and suggestions
as to the possible 7nodus operandi. Telepathy being regarded as
scientifically proved, Section IV. takes us on to the consideration of
the phenomena of automatism and lucidity, dealing especially with
automatic writing and trance speech, and containing an extended
examination of the Piper experiences. The chapter bearing on the
cross-correspondences which have figured so largely in our recent
publications will be particularly useful to those newly entering upon
a study of the subject, though, as the author points out, it is hope-
less for any one to attempt to form an opinion on this large and
complicated subject without patient study of the writings of Mr.
Piddington, Mrs. Verrall, Miss Johnson and others, which have
appeared in recent volumes of the Society's Proceedings.
It would be futile to attempt within our limits of space to
summarise the argument based on the evidence before us. Opinions
will widely differ as to the conclusions which may be rightly drawn
from it. Assuming telepathy or thought-transference to be proved
as an operative power, the question rises as to what are the limits
of its potentiality. On this point no one is yet in a position to
form a very definite opinion. Most students of our publications will
no doubt concur with Sir Oliver Lodsre in regarding thought-trans-
ference as experimentally proved to this extent—namely, that there
may often be produced "a hazy and diflBcult recognition by one
person of objects kept as vividly as possible in the consciousness of
another person." But such elementary thought-transference as this
is utterly and hopelessly insufficient to account for such phenomena
as are presented in the automatic writings of Mrs. Piper and others,
and especially in the cross-correspondences. Is it then scientifically
admissible to adduce as a true explanation of such phenomena
hypothetical extensions of the faculty of thought-transference which
have not been experimentally proved 1 Materialists who are strongly
biassed against the supposition of The Survival of Man will doubt-
less be disposed to press any and every such hypothesis into their
180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1909.
service. Bub some significance must be attributed to the fact that
the intelligences or "controls" through which the phenomena under
discussion reach us, uniformly claim to be discarnate survivals.
As to the identification of such controls, it is obvious that no
description of the experiments, however detailed, can be expected
to [)roduce the same convincing effect as that which may be
experienced by a first-hand witness. After an exhaustive analysis
of ;ill the facts, our author says: "It rather feels as if we were
at the beginning of what is practically a new branch of science
and that to pretend to frame explanations except in the most
tentative and elastic fashion for the purpose of threading the
facts together and suggesting fresh fields for experiment, is as
premature as it would have been for Galvani to have expounded
the nature of electricity or Copernicus the laws of comets and
meteors." And again, " Man's practical outlook upon the universe is
entering upon a new phase . . . his power of reciprocal mental
intercourse is in process of being enlarged ;. for there are signs that
it will some day be no longer limited to contemporary denizens of
earth, but will permit a utilisation of knowledge and powers superior
to his own, even to the extent of ultimately attaining trustworthy
information concerning other conditions of existence."
All psychical researchers will rejoice, rejoice perhaps with something
of wonder, that Sir Oliver Lodge has found time, in the midst of
a strenuous life, to render them such service as is rendered by the
volume befoie us. They will eagerly look for the further help,
promised in his Preface, to the study of what are known as the
"Physical phenomena" of spiritualism.
It ou]y remains to say that the work is admirably got up iti the
style already familiar to readers of the author's previous work, Man
and the Uiiiverse, and that it contains a copious Index. One
suggestion, however, may perhaps be made; namely, that the limits
of quotations should be more uniformly indicated by the use of
inverted commas. Sometimes a change of type assists us ; but at
other times, for example, in the quotation of Mrs. Verrall, commencing
on p. 337, it is not very obvious at first sight where the quotation
ends and comment begins. H_ Arthur Smith.
NOTICE.
In consequence of statements that appeared in several news-
papers about a club to be called the International Club for
Psychical Eesearch, a number of enquiries reached us. We
therefore desire to make it clear that—contrary to the suggestion
conveyed by some of the newspaper paragraphs—the proposed
Club has no connection of any kind with our Society. It
was also stated that Professor Barrett would be the first
President of the Club, but Professor Barrett informed us that
this statement was entirely groundless.

I.
On the Detection of Hidden Objects by Dowsers.
By Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S.
Although our Society has of late devoted so much of its
time to the critical investigation of automatic writing and
other evidence which points to the existence of life and
184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., i9io.
intelligence in the Unseen, it must not be forgotten that there
are many other branches of psychical research which need
fuller enquiry and more abundant evidence than we possess
at present. We still need more evidence on telepathy before
it can be generally accepted by orthodox science, but its
credentials are, by most, now considered higher than those on
behalf of clairvoyance. And yet this should not be the case,
for it would not be difficult to gain the additional evidence
we desire if the members of our Society would co-operate in
this matter. One object I have in bringing this paper before
you is to urge this co-operation, to show how you can set about
it, and to indicate the kind of results you might obtain.
The term clairvoyance is frequently used to mean perceiving
spirits : of that I know nothing ; it may or may not be true,
but you will first have to convince science that spirits demon-
strably exist, before you can hope science to believe they can
be seen by certain persons. In the present paper I restrict
the term clairvoyance to the perception of some hidden object
without the aid of ordinary vision, or of any of the recognized
organs of sense. Such perception may be a conscious act,
but it is more frequently sub-conscious, revealing itself by
some involuntary muscular action, such as the twisting of a
forked twig, held in neutral or in unstable equilibrium, or by
automatic writing, or occasionally by an epigastric or emotional
spasm. It is an ideo-motor stimulus, albeit the idea is usually
a sub-conscious one.
The term coined by Mr. Myers, tela:sthesia, sensation at a
distance, better expresses this than clairvoyance, and I hope
this term may come into more general use. It is true that,
verbally, telepathy and tehesthesia have much the same mean-
ing. Mr. Myers has however defined the latter as a " knowledge
of things terrene which surpasses the limits of ordinary per-
ception " in distinction to telepathy, which he defines as
" fellow-feeling at a distance." What we need is a word
expressing sujjcrnormal-mattcr-pcrcepiion, as distinct from tele-
pathy, which is supernormal-mincl-perception.
Dowsing for water and mineral lodes, is, as I have shown in the
reports published in Vols. XIII. and XV. of our Proceedings, the
best evidence we possess of this faculty of telcesthesia or super-
normal-matter-perception. A good dowser can find indifferently
Jan., 1910. Detection of Hidden Objects by Dotvsers. 185
mineral lodes, underground water, buried coins or any other
object, the appearance of which is known to him, and which
he definitely sets forth to find. In regions where mineral oil
is found, a dowser is sometimes employed, and with remarkable
success, to locate the underground oil-spring. In both my
Eeports on the dowsing rod, several striking instances of the
discovery of hidden coins by difl'erent dowsers were given. I
will only refer to two of these : one is on the evidence of a
Wiltshire country gentleman, Mr. W. J. Brown, and published
by him in the Bath Natural History and Field Club Proceedings
for 1889. Mr. Brown had employed the famous dowser, John
Mullins, to locate the site for a well, which turned out a great
success, and incidentally tested Mullins' power of finding hidden
coins. Mr. Brown writes
In Mullins' absence we took ten stones off a wall, and, having
placed them on the road, we put a sovereign under three of the
stones. [When Mullins returned] he passed his rod over the stones,
and without the slightest hesitation told us at once under which
stone the sovereigns were. When he came to a stone under which
there was no sovereign he at once said, "Nothing here, master,"
but when he came to the others he remarked, "All right, master,
thankee," turned the stone over and put the sovereign in his
pocket.
A more stringent test is the following : Mr. Bruce, of
Norton Hall, Grloucester, who also employed John Mullins
successfully to find water, writes to me as follows :
Mullins also found a half-sovereign I had buried in a walk we
were then making. I would have lost the half-sovereign if it had
not been for Mullins, as I was so careful not to put any mark
[where it was hidden] that I was not able to find the place myself,
and when Mullins stopped and said it was under his foot, I
thought he was wrong, but there it was !
Miss Miles,—to whom, with Miss Eamsden, we are so much
indebted for their painstaking and successful experiments on
telepathy across great distances,—is also a singularly successful
dowser, and many cases of her success in dowsing I have
investigated ; some are published and others await publication.
Here I will only cite one case in which, whilst locating the
site for a well, she also discovered a buried and long lost
186 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1910.
cistern. Here is the account sent by Mrs. Batson, of Hoe
Benham, Newbury, for whom the experiments were made
Hoe Benham, Newbury,
15 Sep., 1905.
I was anxious this suromer, 1905, to lay on a small supply of
water to a part of our flower garden which suffered much from
drought, and Miss Miles very kindly consented to seek for a
source that would suffice for our wants. I wished also to locate
the site of the spring from which pipes were laid on for the
supply of our house some fourteen years since. All record of this
site had been lost, even the plumber who had laid on the water
being uncertain about its exact position and unable to indicate it.
Miss Miles very quickly assured us of the whereabouts of this
supply cistern, and a post was driven into the earth at the place
suggested by her. She also indicated another spot at which, as
she asserted, water sufficient for our [flower] borders would be
discovered within a few feet of the surface. Here also the place
was carefully marked. The following morning the ground was
dug out, and a spring of water was found within about six feet
from the surface at the spot where Miss Miles had advised us to
dig for our supply. The crown of the lost cistern also appeared
to sight at the expected place. I must confess to some previous
scepticism, but in both these instances we have had undoubted
evidence as to Miss Miles' gift in divining the existence of water,
and I am now as completely convinced as before I was incredulous
about it. H. M. Batson.
Miss Miles informs me that directly she came near the spot
she " saw the tank unmistakeably, it appeared large with a
rounded top and something branching away from it."
In connection with this supernormal vision, Miss Miles has
kindly submitted to rigorous tests both in London and in Ireland.
As is the case with all other psychics, her lucidity varies, from
causes of which we know nothing. Once in London during Miss
Miles' absence from the room, I concealed a sovereign under one
of several rugs in a drawing room. On her return I asked if
she could find it, and turned away from her, lest any unconscious
guidance from me might assist ; she closed her eyes and said,
" I see it under the corner of that rug." This was correct.
Again I hid the coin in her absence and again she found it
Jan., 1910. Detection of Hidden Objects by Dotvsers. 187
correctly, and the third time she was more doubtful, but it was
fairly right. Telepathy may here be possible, though I doubt
it, but in the case of the tank and in water-finding it is
excluded.
Last May I was invited to witness some experiments at
Caxton Hall, London, where several dowsers were present in
order to test whether they were sensitive to the presence of con-
cealed radium. These experiments were arranged by a consulting
geologist, Mr. Beeby Thompson, F.G.S., who sent me an account
of his preliminary trials at Sanderstead, which are given in
Appendix C to this paper. Mr. Thompson was convinced that
the dowsers detected underground water chiefly when radio-active
emanations came from the water or rocks below.
At Caxton Hall there were present several geologists and
engineers besides Mr. Beeby Thompson, and three dowsers, Mr.
Ede of Arundel, Mr. Farndell of Littlehampton, and Mr. J. F.
Young, formerly one of our hon. associates, whom I had invited to
attend. Fifteen milligrams of radium (worth a very large sum)
were kindly lent by Mr. Glew of Clapham, who was also present.
By means of a rough electroscope, consisting of two silk ribbons
excited to wide divergence by friction, the activity of the
radium was tested. It caused the instant collapse of the
ribbons at a distance of 5 or 6 feet. The radium bromide
was as usual enclosed in a lead box with a lead lid, and when
it was covered, not the slightest effect was produced on the
electroscope even when brought up as close as possible, show-
ing the impermeability of the lead to the rays affecting the
electroscope.
The dowsers were sent out of the room, and the radium,
with the lid off, was then hidden in different places ; but the
results were quite valueless, as is shown in the report which
appeared in the Annals of Psychical Science for July-September
last, p. 507. The dowsers, Ede and Farndell, brought a bundle
of strong forked sticks, and the extraordinary violence with
which these twisted, one limb being constantly wrenched into
two (especially with the dowser Farndell), showed that these
dowsers possessed strong motor automatism. This, however,
does not necessarily indicate, as professional dowsers believe it
does, any corresponding clairvoyant or tehesthetic faculty. It
was, in fact, amusing to notice how powerfully suggestion
188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., i9io.
operated on them. Movement of the uncovered radium down
their back caused the most violent twisting and even breaking
of their forked rods ; whilst when the radium was covered not
the slightest motion occurred. They knew, however, whether the
radium was open or enclosed and were aware it was inert in the
latter CRSG, £IS they watched the previous tests with the electro-
scope. Many present seemed convinced the radium powerfully
affected the dowsers until I made the following experiments :
Showing the dowser under trial the open radium, I stood
behind him and secretly covered the box, then slowly moved
it down the back of the dowser ; the rod twisted violently and
broke. Then I told the dowser (Ede) I was going to cover the
radium and showed him the closed box ;
standing behind him
I secretly uncovered the box and moved it down his back as
before. Not the slightest motion of the rod occurred : this
experiment was repeated two or three times with exactly
similar results. This conclusively demonstrated three things
first, that radio-activity had nothing to do with the motion of
the rod; next, that telepathy had no action, for both I and
Mr. Curnock, the Daily Mail representative, who was present,
knew the real state of affairs ;
and, lastly, that auto-suggestion
on the dowser's part is the true explanation of these experiments.
I was, however, anxious to try Mr. J. F. Young's power of
clairvoyance or tekesthesia when auto-suggestion and other
sources of error were excluded. Those who have read the
Appendix to my second report on the dowsing rod (Vol. XV.
p. 361) will remember I had previously tested Mr. J. F. Young
and found he possessed this faculty ;
moreover, he had auto-
matically and correctly written the words contained in two
opaque and carefully sealed envelopes I had sent to him,
which it was impossible to read by eyesight, nor could the
envelopes be tampered with without discovery ;
they were sent
back to me intact. Accordingly at Caxton Hall, having shut
the dowsers in an adjoining room, I covered the seats of
46 chairs in the large Council Room with hats, coats, and
books, and unseen by any one present, I placed a sovereign
beneath the covering on one chair. Mr. Young was then sent
for and told to try all the chairs in succession whilst I
looked out of the window. At a certain chair he stopped
and said that was the one ; and when it was uncovered.
Jan., 1910. Detection of Hidden Objects by Dowsers. 189
the sovereign was found below. The odds were 45 to 1
against success by chance coincidence. Again he was sent
out of the room and watched by a sceptical friend who
was present, whilst I secretly hid the sovereign under a
hat on another chair. All the others present were requested
to look out of the window (as I did) when Mr. Young was
recalled. Again he correctly found the sovereign without
hesitation. The probability of two successes running being due
to chance coincidence was now over 2000 to 1. A third
experiment was made with Mr. Young, and this time a
sceptical gentleman who was present asked leave to hide
the sovereign, the dowsers of course being absent, and all
others present looking out of the window whilst he did so.
The gentleman who hid the sovereign then left the room
and the dowser came in and fixed upon a certain chair.
This was wrong; but, on the return of the hider of the sove-
reign, he said he had first put it there under a bag and
then removed it to another chair. Without any information
being given to the dowser he was asked again to try and find it,
which he then did correctly. A fourth experiment was made in
a similar way, the sovereign being hidden by another gentleman,
and its position accurately found by Mr. Young, who was
again tried. Finally a sceptical geologist who was present
wished to hide the sovereign, and great precautions were
taken by him to avoid any possible collusion, or knowledge
by any one present of where he had hidden it. In this case
the dowser Mr. Ede was tried, and when he was recalled the
hider left the room. Mr. Ede fixed on a certain chair, and
upon removing the covering the sovereign was not there. The
dowser declared, however, that was the spot, and the geologist
who hid the sovereign, upon being recalled, said it was quite
right, for he had put the sovereign under one of the legs of
that very chair, where it was found.
The law of probabilities shows that chance coincidence could
not be the explanation after the four successes running by
Mr. J. F. Young, nor can I find any other explanation recog-
nized by science. The foregoing evidence,—taken in conjunc-
tion with the amazing success which attended good dowsers
like John Mullins, W. Stone, and the charity boy Bleton in
France in the eighteenth century in finding underground water
190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1910.
when other means had failed,—goes far to establish the
existence of telsesthesia, i.e. a supernormal-matter-perceptive-
power in certain persons commonly called dowsers.
If telaesthesia be really an extension of human faculty
in certain persons, its existence affords an explanation of
many curious statements which are to be found in the works
of some learned writers more than 350 years ago. Thus a
Spanish writer, Alphonsus of Yera Cruz, published a folio
work called Physica Speculatio, in 1557, in which he states
that there are certain people called " Zahoris," or clear-seeing
folk, who have the power of vision through opaque bodies.
A little later the learned and famous Jesuit of Louvain, Martin
Delrio, in his great work on Magic, states that there are
certain men in Spain known as Zahoris, one of whom he saw
in Madrid in 1575, and that these people "can see things
hidden in the inward bowels of the earth, veins of water,
and treasures of metals and also corpses within sarcophagi.
This thing," he remarks, " is most fully received and well
known." ^
P.S.—I asked Mr. Curnock if he could let me have a copy
of the shorthand notes he took of the experiments in the
Caxton Hall. His reply is given in Appendix A.
Prof. Wertheimer, a confident novice at psychical research,
made some experiments a few years ago with the finding of
coins by dowsers, but they were quite inconclusive, as shown
in Appendix B.

Dear Professor Barrett, —I am afraid the notes I made of the
dowsing experiments are mislaid, but I sent a memorandum to
Mr. Dudley Wright at the time and will ask him to look for that,
which may be of some use to you.

I was particularly interested in three things :
(1) The facility with which the old man [Mr. J. F. Young] and
the young man [Mr. Ede] found the hidden coins, especially the
case in which one of the dowsers indicated the right chair when the
coin was hidden under its foot. You will remember that we were
convinced he was wrong, made him try again, and then were set
right by the hider of the coin, who came into the room and lifting
the chair showed the coin on the carpet.
(2) The curious manner in which one dowser indicated the
chair under which the coin was first hid, showing the first
intent of the hider and his subsequent change of intention.
(3) The manner in which the young man responded to suggestion
when he was tried for sensitiveness to radium. You will remember
that he "found" or "felt" radium when the box was closed (being
then told it was open) and was insensitive to the radium when
the box was open (being then told it was closed).
Yours faithfully,
George C. Curnock.
APPENDIX B. . -
In a paper on " Some Experiments with Water Finders " Professor
Wertheimer of Bristol four years ago tried a professional dowser,
named Mr. Chennels, of Northamptonshire, with coins concealed
beneath saucers. I have never heard of Chennels as a dowser, and
Professor Wertheimer seemed unable to obtain the co-operation of
a really successful dowser. However, the summary of the experi-
ments on hidden coins tried with Chennels is as follows :
"Experiment 1. 12 saucers used, coins under same; dowser right
in 7 cases, wrong in 5.
'
•
Experiment 2. 7 saucers used ; dowser right in 4 cases, wrong
in 3.
Experiment 3. 9 saucers used; dowser right in 7 cases, wrong
in 2 : a distinct success.
Experiment 4. Place of experiment changed to open air. 12
saucers used ; dowser right in 2 cases, wrong in 10, a distinct
failure.
Experiment 5. 5 saucers used, coin under one saucer only,
correctly found ; so that the result of these five sets of experiments
was that distinct success was attained in two cases only, distinct
failure in one, and very little better than chance coincidence in
two cases. The results therefore were inconclusive."

RECORD OF EXPERIMENTS MADE AT SANDERSTEAD,
APRIL 10th, 1909.
By Beeby Thompson, F.C.S., F.G.S.
Messrs. Duke and Ockenden recommended Mr. Arthur Ede of
Arundel, aged 27, as one who they believed had the power
of "Divining," as the term is usually understood, that is to say, he
was affected in some mysterious way by running water.
In the experiments detailed a sample of 10 milligrammes of pure
Radium Bromide was used, obtained from Mr. Glew of Clapham
Road.
The experiments commenced about mid-day in a garden at Sander-
stead and extended to near five o'clock, and Mr. Ede used ordinary
forked twigs which he had cut himself, but they were rather thicker
than he preferred.
Experiment 1. Ede located certain spots in the garden, which,
pegged out, made a nearly straight, diagonal line, and this line he
predicted was that of a spring. There was no means of proving
this. The garden is on Chalk (with possibly a capping of gravel),
and it is rather improbable that there is any spring within a
moderate distance underground, as the garden is on a slope and
no springs come out on the hill-side.
Experiment 2. The garden, mostly grass, was more thoroughly
gone over, and the same spots were again indicated ; but although
Ede walked right over the spot where the Radium was buried a
few inches underground in a cardboard box, he did not detect it.
An interval of 15 minutes or more was allowed between successive
experiments, and Mr. Ede never knew at any time what the experi-
ments were for. Radium was never mentioned.
Experiment 3. Set tap running in house, and caused Ede to
walk over a considerable length of ground by side of house, where
the waste water was running only a few inches below ground, but
nothing happened.
Experiment 4. Put Ede beside a water-pipe which led to the
bath-room, etc., on the floor above, and tested him in various ways
by turning the water on and off. On the whole this was very
satisfactory. When the tap was turned on and off quickly the
response was quick, although Ede and Mr. Maurice Ockenden, who
was with him, said they could not hear the water running from
the tap. When the tap was turned on very gently, as much as
two minutes elapsed before the movement of water was detected.
Jan., 1910. Detection of Hidden Objects by Bowsers. 193
Experiment 5. Hid the Radium in a slipper standing on the
floor of a room. Ede failed to detect it, and at only one point
in the room was there a rather doubtful movement of the twig.
Experiment 6. Hid two sovereigns in a small cup standing on
a table, and the Radium in a cloth bag hanging by the fire-place.
The coins were not detected, but the Radium was accurately
located.
Experiment 7. After an interval repeated the last experiment
coins not detected. Radium located just as before. Ede said he
seemed drawn to this spot, he had never felt anything like it
before.
Experiment 8. After another interval, during which the Radium
had been removed from the bag and placed under a cushion on a
couch, Ede found that he seemed drawn both to the bag and to
the couch, although the bag was empty.
Experiment 9. Further trials led Ede to remark that he couldn't
make it out, he seemed to be getting affected all over the room,
although when he first began the trials there was little effect on
him.

: Some Sittings with Carancini.
By W. W. Baggally.
A SERIES of articles have recently appeared in Italian newspapers,
in L'Eclio du Merveilleux, in the Annales des Sciences Psychiques,
and in the Annals of Psychical Science, referring to physical
phenomena which it was alleged took place in the presence of a
new medium, Francesco Carancini. The seances at which these
phenomena occurred were held in the residence of Baron von
Erhardt, a gentleman who has resided in Rome for some time
and who has been instrumental in bringing the alleged super-
normal powers of Carancini befoie the notice of several scientific
men. The phenomena said to occur in connection with this
medium appear, prima facie, to be very similar to those produced
by Eusapia Palladino, such as the transportation and levitation
of objects, impressions on clay, and luminous appearances ; but
there are others which it is asserted take place with Carancini
and which, so far as my reading and experience go, are dissimilar
to Eusapia's. I refer to the writing on lamp black in Latin,
194 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1910.
modern and ancient Greek, and in an unknown language, the
passing of objects into closed wire cages, and the taking off of
the medium's jacket while his hands are presumably securely
held by the controllers.
The article that appeared in the April, 1909, number of the
Annals of Psychical Science is illustrated by flashlight photographs
which purport to show the phenomena at the actual moment of
their occurrence. Musical instruments are seen apparently
floating in the air, and larger objects, such as tables, appear to
have been raised from the floor and placed upon the medium's
shoulders. In one photograph Carancini is seen levitated. I
shall have occasion to refer to these photographs later on.
Dr. Lancellotti communicated the above mentioned article
to the Annals of Psychical Science. He states therein that
" Carancini seems to have discovered his mediumship one
evening when he was present at a seance at which Politi was
the medium." A few days afterwards another seance took place
at which Carancini was persuaded to try his powers as a
medium, and these were, according to Dr. Lancellotti, almost
at once shown to be even stronger than those of Politi himself.
Carancini, for some time, continued to officiate as medium in
spiritistic circles only. It was not until the beginning of last
year that a series of more carefully controlled experiments
could be carried out. These took place, as I have already
stated, in the residence of Baron von Erhardt in Eome. During
the course of a conversation with Professors Bottazzi and
Galeotti (two gentlemen who were present at some of our
recent seances with Eusapia Palladino) Mr. Feilding and I were
told of the existence of Carancini.
Owing to the short time that I had at my disposal between
the termination of the Eusapia seances and Christmas day I
was obliged to hurry back to lingland, but Mr. Feilding while
passing through Kome in December, 1908, had an opportunity
of assisting at two sittings with this medium. Dr. Schiller
happening to be in Piome also assisted at these sittings, and
subsequently attended other stances, and Mr. Feilding and he
were sufficiently interested in what they observed to recommend
the Council to engage in a more systematic study of the case.
Signor Carancini was accordingly invited to England, and
during the months of July and August, 1909, gave a series of
Jan., 1910. Sittings with Garancini. 195
thirteen seances. Nine of these took place in Mr. Feilding's
house in John Street, Mayfair, and four in the country residence
of a mutual friend of Mr. Feilding and myself. At these last
a lady was present who was believed to be a physical medium.
It was thought advisable to try some experiments in the presence
of this lady and Garancini.
I was asked to undertake the general conduct of the sittings
and to look after the comfort of the medium. Garancini does
not speak English. I spent with him the greater part of his
stay in this country, 1 understand Italian and was consequently
of service to him.
Mr. Feilding was present at twelve of the sittings, Mr. Sydney
Scott at eight, Sir "William Grookes at four, Lady Grookes at
three, Sir Lawrence Jones at four, Dr. Wm. MacDougall at two,
Mr. Sidgwick and Miss Isabel Newton at one, and I at all the
thirteen. Various other friends of Mr. Feilding and myself were
also invited to several of the sittings in order to make a larger
circle in accordance with the medium's request. Garancini is
accustomed to sit outside the cabinet with his back to it. An
oblong table, such as a small kitchen table, is placed in front
of him, upon which he places his hands. These are con-
trolled by the sitters on either side by holding his hands or
by Garancini placing his hands on theirs. His feet are also
controlled by the feet of the same sitters. At our S(^ances the
controllers took their boots off to enable them better to feel
the medium's feet.
With Eusapia Palladino tlie musical instruments and other
objects used in the transportations are generally placed inside
the cabinet, but with Garancini they are placed, as a rule,
outside on shelves or small tables at his side and at a short
distance from him.
I have already made mention of the writing in foreign
languages on smoked glass and of the passage of objects into
a closed wire case. In the hope that these phenomena would
take place with us I had a case made like two picture frames
put together, with a glass front and a glass back to them. The
inner surface of one of the glass plates was smoked, and could
be seen through the other plate, but the smoked surface could
not be tampered with without separating the two picture frames.
These were securely sealed together. I also procured a wire
196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., l9io.
cage, the door and wires of which were strongly soldered. It
was impossible for an object of a larger bulk than the space
between the wires to enter the cage, except by breaking it,
unless supernormally. The smoked frame and the wire cage
were examined by Mr. Feilding and myself, at the commence-
ment of each sitting, to verify that no writing was then on
the smoked glass and that no object had been introduced into
the cage. Besides these test apparatus Sir William Crookes
supplied two rings cut out of a piece of parchment. The
threading of these rings together without either being damaged
would have conclusively proved the possibility of the passage
of matter through matter. Other objects, such as a tambourine,
a toy trumpet, a bell, a zither, an indiarubber ball, etc., were
also placed on the table on the right of the medium and on
the tray stand and the steps of a ladder on his left. At the
third seance, and at subsequent ones, a chair was put inside
the cabinet with one or two objects on it. An electrical
apparatus with white and red globes hung from the ceiling
over the seance table. The intensity of the light could be
regulated (from light sufficiently strong for the reading of
small print to a mere glimmer) by means of a commutator
which rested on the stenographer's table. This was always
done in accordance with the medium's request. In other
respects he willingly submitted to any precautions that
were from time to time suggested. A three-leaved clothes
horse, 6 feet in height, upon which a fine mesh hammock net
had been tightly stretched and nailed, was placed behind him,
with the two outer leaves one on each side of him, at the John
Street seances, so as to prevent contact with any of the objects
placed according to his wont for transportation. I had some
pieces of cardboard painted with luminous paint sewn to his
coat sleeves close to his wrists.
The general procedure at Carancini's seances is as follows
After the sitters have taken their places round the seance
table and formed the chain, i.e. taken hold of each other's hands,
and the control of the medium has been established, he requests
them to keep silence for a short time and then asks them to
talk. While they are doing so Carancini goes into what pur-
ports to be a state of trance. An alleged spirit guide named
Giuseppe then controls him and produces the principal mani

festations. Questions asked are now answered by Giuseppe
through the medium or by means of raps.
I will now describe the phenomena that took place at our
sittings, giving extracts from the stenographic notes taken at
the time.
SSance I. July 30th, 1909.
Mrs. Sidgwick controUing on the left of medium.
Mr. Baggally on the right.
In very dim light.
Mrs. Sidgwick reports : Raps on my chair. I was touched behind
at the back just above the seat or my chair, as if it came through
the back of the chair. It was not a definable touch, only a feeling
of something.
Sir William Crookes controlling on left.
Dr. Wni. MacDougall on right.
Complete darkness.
The small tray-stand on left of medium, behind the net screen
and close to Sir William Crookes, is heard to fall over.
Sir William immediately says : I had my hand holding his between
my fingers and the palm of my hand. He was grasping my fingers
between his thumb and the first and second fingers and so tightly that
it became almost painful. The foot control was perfect. On the
white light being turned up the tray-stand and the various objects
upon it are found upset on the floor.
Seance II.
Controllers—Sir Wm. Crookes on left.
Lady Crookes on right.
Notes taken in the dark. Raps, apparently on the floor behind
medium, follow raps made by ourselves on the table. Both con-
trollers report that his feet are under control, and his hands are
quite still on the table. Scratches are heard on the woodwork of
the net screen. The medium said he was going to try and produce
one more phenomenon. He then raised his two hands, held on each
side by Sir WiUiam and Lady Crookes, made a great effort and a
noise was heard. Giuseppe then said that he had lifted the screen
10 centimetres and it had then fallen back. When the white light was
turned up the screen is found changed in position and partly pushed
into the opening of the cabinet.
198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1910.
Siance III.
Controllers^—Sir Wm. Crookes on left.
Mr. Scott on right.
Light diminished to the last point.
Thiee raps are heard, position indeterminable, sort of dull thuds
low down. Then series of raps apparently inside cabinet. Feet of
medium stated to be immovable by both controllers. Hands motion-
less on table. The medium asks the controllers to hold his legs
well and to place them so that they can feel them all the way down
from the knee. Medium asks that somebody should knock on the
table. Feilding raps four rhythmical knocks ;
they are answered like
an echo, apparently in the cabinet. Feilding does it again and an
extremely bad imitation follows, all wrong.
Sir William puts his hand between the back of the medium's chair
and curtain. Feilding then asked that raps should be made inside
cabinet. Raps are heard of a different quality of sound and Sir
William said that the}^ sounded near where his hand was. Sir
William says : The medium was moving my hand, and whenever
he moved my hand backwards a rap sounded on the floor.
Stance IV.
Controllers—Sir Lawrence Jones on right.
Sir William Crookes on left.
Bright red light. Raps that cannot be localized, apparently low
down on floor beliind Sir William Crookes. Both hands visible
and held on the table motionless. Feet held as before motionless.
Light diminished to No. 3. He moves Sir William's hand, and
synchronously with the movements raps are heard low down behind
him. He does the same with his right hand with Sir Lawrence Jones'
hand with the same result.
Medium asks for paper and pencil and writes something. The
writing, when the light was turned up, contained the words, "Non
sono Giuseppe sono Zurucruft," (I am not Joseph, I am Zurucruft,)
and then follow a few lines of what looks like Tamil. Speaking
he says that he was an Lidian who died 4000 years ago.
Feilding says : I have asked Giuseppe who it was who answered
saying he was an Lidian who died 4000 years ago. Giuseppe
replied that "he" did, as the other entity cannot speak. He says
they cannot communicate. He only knows by intuition what he
wants. When asked how he knew he was an Indian who died
Jan., 1910. Sittings with Garancini, 199
4000 years ago, he said that he has been told by high spirits. He
says that Zurucruft often turns up at seances, and that it is quite
possible that Padre Ludovico da Castelfino may turn up and address
a few words of theological exhortation. He was a theologian of
the Bishop of Torraeini, who died 25 or 26 years ago.
Stance V.
'
Controllers—Sir Lawrence Jones on right.
Mr. Scott on left.
Bright red light. The medium stretches his right hand, clasping
Sir Lawrence Jones' hand, three times towards net screen, and the
movements are followed by three raps apparently on the floor. The
medium rapped Sir Lawrence's knuckles on the table twice, which
is followed by raps somewhere behind the medium's chair. He does
the same with his left hand with Mr. Scott's knuckles, and the
knocks are followed by raps somewhere behind the medium's chair.
The medium enters the cabinet. The screen with net work is
placed round him.
Medium takes his coat off with the luminous patches on.
Complete darkness.
A small single light of a bluish colour is seen rather high up.
Another light lower down. All the time medium was gasping a
good deal. Another light towards the middle of the curtain. Another
light from the right side of the cabinet curtain. Two more lights
which appear to be separating. A light quite near the left wall
appeared. A larger and stronger light low down about three feet
from the ground. It is seen by all again. Griuseppe asks us to
awaken the medium. Mr. Scott and Mr. Baggally went into the
cabinet immediately afterwards and did not perceive any smell of
phosphorus.
After seance Mr. Baggally examined the medium all over in order
to see if there were any hidden mechanism or electric batteries or
anything that would produce the hghts, but found nothing except a
box of safety matches.
Stance VI.
Controllers—Sir Lawrence Jones on left.
Mr. Feilding on right.
Red light lowered to No. 4.
Medium makes gestures with Feilding's hand in the air. Eaps
are heard down apparently on the floor—to medium's left. Quite

unevidential. Feilding asks him what he did when he wanted to
produce a phenomenon. He said, "I send out fluid." Feilding
asked, did he mean muscular contraction? He said, yes.
•
Siawe VII.
Controllers —Dr. Wm. MacDougall on left.
Mr. Haselton on right.
Complete darkness.
Medium raps on table and a rap is heard apparently behind him
on the floor. Feilding thereupon gives three raps on the table, and
three raps answer apparently on the same place as before. The
medium holds his hands up and raps are heard behind him. Con-
trollers report feet quite still. Medium writes. When writing is
examined after white light was turned up, it proved to be some
more of that apparentlj'^ oriental writing.
Medium makes a convulsive eff'ort. MacDougall feels a touch on
the elbow—then Giuseppe says. You must stop at once ; wake the
medium instantly.
Stance VIII.
Controllers —Mr. Scott on left.
Mr. C. on right.
Eed light lowered to lowest point.
Medium holds his right hand holding C.'s hand out to screen.
His hand trembles. Raps are heard.
Thumps are heard. The medium asks the controllers to ascertain
that the chair legs are on the carpet. Medium raps twice on table.
Eaps are heard in reply.
Controllers are changed.
Mr. Haselton is now on the right.
Mr. Claude Askew on the left.
Complete darkness.
Mrs. Askew, who is seated next to Mr. Haselton, says : I feel a
touch ; it touched my shoulder four times lightly.
Mr. Askew says : I am tapped on left shoulder. The controllers
report hands of medium held ;
position of his head unknown.
Haselton now says : The left hand back of my chair was touched.
I wondered what it was, and I was tapped three times by a distinct
hand. It was a hand ; that I am certain of. Medium's hands reported
to be on table and held separately.
Jan., 1910. Sittings with Garancini. 201
Stance XIII.
Controllers—Mr. C. on the right.
Mr. Baggally on the left.
Complete darkness.
Mrs. Lowry reports : I was touched behind. There is some one
behind my chair. My name has been called twice.
Before referring to the four other sittings which were held
at the country residence of a mutual friend of Mr. Feilding
and myself, and at which sittings the lady who was believed
to possess supernormal physical powers was present, I will
comment on the phenomena that I have just described. The
first thing that strikes a reader of the above stenographic
notes is the paucity in number of the phenomena and the
unsatisfactory conditions under which they were obtained.
With the exception of some of the raps which occurred in
light, more or less strong, all the other phenomena took
place in complete darkness.
Carancini appeared to be willing to submit to any precautions,
but somehow no manifestations occurred, with the exception of
the raps, until after the light had been completely extinguished
at the request of the alleged control Giuseppe. The phenomena
were therefore quite unlike those that Mr. Feilding, Mr.
Carrington, and I witnessed with Eusapia Palladino and to
which we attach great importance on account of their occur-
rence in good light.
It will be noted that, with the exception of the raps on
Mrs. Sidgwick's chair at the first seance, all the raps were
heard to sound behind the medium, apparently on the floor
or in the cabinet behind his chair.
The fact that the raps were heard in that locality and in
close proximity to the medium suggests the probability that
they were produced by his tipping the chair on which he sat
and striking the floor with the back legs. Mr. Scott, when
he was controlling, noticed a suspicious movement of the
medium's body when he heard some of the raps, and Mr.
C. at seance VIII. just after the note in stenographer's
report which reads, " Thumps are heard. The medium asks
the controllers to ascertain that the chair legs are on the
carpet," makes the following observation, " I should like to
202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1910.
correct that as I was looking round to see if the legs were
on the carpet, as I thought, I saw the legs of the chair moving."
The raps at the iirst seances, though not loud, were sharp and
distinct, but after a carpet had been placed under Carancini's
chair they changed in sound, being then more like thuds.
The controller's statements that when the raps were heard
the medium's hands and feet were immovable do not prove
that he might not have been tipping his chair at those times.
His hands and feet could have been perfectly still and yet
his body could have tipped the light chair upon which he sat.
I have stated that at the first sitting Mrs. Sidgwick heard
a few faint raps on her chair. They were inaudible to
me. I sat on the other side of Carancini controllin<T him.
These and the raps at the second seance, after the medium
had asked the controllers to hold his legs well and place them
so that they could feel them all the way down from the knee,
were the most evidential.
Taking into consideration the difficulty of localizing sound,
the possibility of raps being produced by the cracking of a
joint (I have met individuals who made raps in this manner)
and the above stated suspicious circumstance of the medium's
chair having been seen to move and also of the change in
the character of the sounds when a carpet was placed under
Carancini's chair, there seems strong evidence that the raps
were produced normally.
I attach no importance to the scratches heard on the wood-
work of the screen nor to the change of position of the screen
at seance II. The back of the medium's chair was in close
proximity to the framework, and Carancini's convulsive move-
ments could have produced these phenomena by the rubbing
and pushing of his chair against the framework.
The writing by the medium in apparently oriental characters
is of no evidential value whatever. Even if it had been
really in an oriental language this would not have precluded
the possibility of his having learnt to form the characters
previously in his normal condition. This hypothesis is supported
by the fact that some of these characters written by the medium
in our own presence resembled others that are shown in one
of the photographs in the Annals of Psychical Science. These
last were alleged to have been produced by an independent
Jan., 1910. Sittings with Garancini. 20a
entity, not by the medium. The name of the Indian who
died 4000 years ago, " Zurucruft," has a German sound about
it, as if it were intended to represent the past participle of
ziiriickrufen, to call back.
When considering the evidential value of a phenomenon it
should be borne in mind that if the conditions under which
it occurs are such that it could have been brought about by
normal means, then a normal explanation should be accepted,
as this would be in accordance with our ordinary principles of
reasoning.
I apply this rule to the consideration of the other phenomena
which took place at our sittings in total darkness.
The falling over of the tray-stand behind the net when one
of the medium's hands controlled by Sir William Crookes was
brought in close proximity to it, although he did not touch
the stand, might have been caused by pushing the net against
it. Sir William Crookes' hand was pressed against the net
and the net yielded a few inches. The tray-stand stood at
the time quite close behind the net.
The lights seen at seance Y., within or close to the cabinet,
appeared after Carancini entered the cabinet by himself and
consequently when he was uncontrolled. He sat on a chair inside
the cabinet with the clothes horse surrounding him ; but this
precaution, which had been suggested by himself, would not have
prevented him from standing on the chair, as there was no netting
on the top of the clothes horse. A suspicious noise was heard as
if the medium were getting on his chair just before the lights
appeared high up towards the ceiling. One of the sitters, Mrs.
Paton, made tlie remark at the time—" It sounds as if he were
getting on the chair." The medium took his jacket off with the
luminous patches on it before he sat in the cabinet. This was
a very suspicious action on his part. It suggested that he did
not wish the position of his hands to be known at the time
that the lights were seen.
When the seance was over I searched the medium and
found in his pocket a box of safety matches, and amongst
them a few phosphorus matches. I took one of these, and
after the medium had retired I produced, in the dark, with
the phosphorus match that I had taken, before Mr. Scott
and Miss Saunders the stenographer, lights which were in
204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1910.
all appearances identical with those that had been seen at
the seance.
The phenomena of the touches remains to be dealt with.
Before I refer to these I will relate our experiences at the
country residence of our friend. Some of these experiences
have a bearing on the methods that in my opinion could
have been used for the production of the touches. The results
obtained at Mr. Feilding's house up to the eighth sitting
had proved almost wholly negative. There were, it is true,
a certain number of phenomena besides the raps, but these
phenomena had occurred in complete darkness and were of
such a nature that the possibility of their having been produced
by normal means could not be excluded. Both Mr. Feilding
and I were greatly disappointed at these results. We had
hoped that the members of our Council and other sitters who
attended the sittings would have witnessed phenomena similar
to, and under as good test conditions as, those that we had
obtained with Eusapia Palladino at Naples. We did not, how-
ever, abandon all hope, but decided to continue the investigation
in a different environment and in the presence of fresh sitters.
The boisterous manifestations that we obtained at the first
sitting in the residence of our friend, seemed fully to justify
us in the course that we took.
Miss X., the lady to whom I have referred, who was believed
to be a physical medium, sat as controller on Carancini's right,
and oixr host in a like capacity on his left.
Mr. Feilding graphically describes what took place at this
seance in a letter to Miss Johnson. These are his words
August \'2th, 1909.
We had a seance last night. The results were sensational to a
degree, also exasperating. Unfortunately we had not got our luminous
patches nor the network screen ; nor were Baggally and I controlling,
also it was exceedingly dark. I had every reason to believe that
the control was well carried out. The controllers constantly reported
that they had the hand firmly by the thumb and their legs were
right round the medium's legs. In these conditions we had a large
number of pinches and touches and transportations of objects. Some
of the manifestations were rather violent and the ladies screamed.
[Our hostess], who sat number two from the medium, had the
shoulder of her dress pulled right down, a handkerchief was wiped
Jan., 1910. Sittings with Caraneini. 205
all over her face, thrust down the front of her dress inside, and then
pulled out again right across her husband, who was controlling.
Miss X., who was controlling on the right (and although very
nervous appears to have frozen on like grim death), was seized by
the leg and nearly pulled out of her chair, and subsided in shrieks
upon the floor, still grasping the medium's hand when the light was
turned up. Objects at a distance of more than a foot from my
extended hand, when sitting in the medium's position, were moved,
one of them being transported to a second table, added at tlie
further end of the medium's table, in order to accommodate the large-
circle. A hand felt about all over Miss X. and Miss W., who was.
holding her in her arms to give her courage.
Further, a dinner bell placed on a chair in the cabinet fell
to the ground with a loud crash.
At last, thought we, the phenomena are genuine. Mr. Feilding
and I therefore decided to use extra precautions and to control
the medium ourselves. We did so the following evening, Mr..
Feilding controlling on the right and I on the left.
At this sitting Miss X. occupied a seat next to me on my left.
Shortly after the light was extinguished the usual raps were-
heard, apparently on the floor behind the medium, but what
surprised me was that they were accompanied by loud raps,
under Miss X.'s chair. I very gradually lowered my left hand,,
which I had free, and placed it under the chair of this lady,,
till I could feel the heels of her feet. I then detected Miss X.
striking the floor with the point of one of her boots, thus pro-
ducing the loud raps that were heard under her.
This discovery immediately gave rise in my mind to the
suspicion that some of the phenomena of the previous seance
had been produced by her. I also could no longer feel sure
that she had continuously held the medium's hand while she
was controlling him. The evidence for the genuineness of the
manifestation was further vitiated by Mr. Feilding and ujy
detecting the medium, shortly after, in the fraudulent pro-
duction of phenomena by means of his right hand, which he
had liberated after resorting to the trick of substitution of
hands. Owing to the luminous patches on his sleeves the
first substitution was immediately detected. After this the
control of his hands was conducted with deliberate carelessness
and the substitution was repeated four or five times. It was
206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1910.
carried out with extreme caution. We could see the medium's
right hand being retired, at a snail's pace, from contact with
Mr. Feilding's hand while he substituted his left hand for it.
After this Carancini passed his free hand under the table,
touched us, and pulled our coats. It should be noted that at
the time of the substitutions the medium purported to be in
a state of trance and under control of Giuseppe. I am unable
to say whether this was really the case. If it was, Giuseppe
must have been the guilty party who perpetrated the frauds,
and he must have practised them for a long time previously
to this series of sittings. I sometimes think that, with physical
mediums, the alleged control serves as a very convenient
scapegoat, ever ready to hand to bear the blame which other-
wise would have attached to the mediums when they are
found out in trickery.
Only three phenomena now remain to be described, i.e. the
movement of a pencil, the touches on the shoulders of two
sitters at the third sitting at our friend's house, and the
luminous appearances at the fourth sitting. A pencil and
paper had been placed on the seance table at a distance of
about 3 feet in front of the medium. This pencil was heard,
in total darkness, to move apparently independently two or
three times. I must observe that previous to the first move-
ment Carancini had leaned his head on his outstretched arms
on the table. By this action his hands, which were tied to
the hands of our host and myself, were brought close to the
pencil, and it was not impossible for him to have taken hold
of it with the tips of two of his fingers and, after he sat back
in his chair and raised his hands, to have let the pencil drop
on the table and thus produce the sound. When the pencil
was heard to move a second time '
Giuseppe ' said, " I did not
do that." I have a strong suspicion that Miss X., who was
seated opposite to where the pencil was, produced this pheno-
menon. I permit myself to say this as Miss X. has since
admitted to our host her offences in respect to these sittings.
Carancini at this seance not only had his hands held by the
controllers but his wrists were tied to theirs. It was not
possible for him to effect a substitution of hands, nevertheless
our host and I, who were controlling, felt light touches on
our shoulders on the sides next to the medium. When I
Jan., 1910. Sittings with Carancini. 207
received a touch I previously felt a movement of the medium's
arm which gave me the impression that he was leaning his
body towards me. The touch felt as if he were pressing my
.shoulder gently with his nose.
The only manifestation at the last seance, held in our friend's
house, was the appearance of a few lights, one at a time, in
or near the cabinet, after Carancini had entered it by himself
uncontrolled. Each light resembled a phosphorus match head
when rubbed between the fingers. After the sitting was over
the medium was insistent about my searching him. He possibly
may have had in his mind the fact that I had found a box
of matches on him on a previous occasion. I searched him,
but found no matches this time. A single phosphorus match,
however, would have sufficed for the production of the lights,
for it is so small an object that it could have been easily con-
cealed about his person after the lights were seen.
I have said enough to show that all the phenomena that we
obtained with Carancini were of an unsatisfactory nature. With
the exception of the raps they all took place in absolute darkness.
The medium, or 'Giuseppe,' was detected several times carrying
out the trick of substitution of hands, after which the sitters
got touches. When he was not able to effect a substitution,
owing to his hands being tied, there were indications that he
then made use of his head to touch the sitters.
It is by the above methods that he, in my opinion, produced
the touches which were felt at the John Street sittings.
The only touch that could not have been produced by either
of the above methods was the one felt, in the dim light, by Mrs.
Sidgwick at the first seance. I understood Mrs. Sidgwick to
say, however, just after she reported the touch, that she came
to the conclusion that she was mistaken in the cause of her
sensation, which she found was really due to the pressure of
the bottom bar of her chair against her back.
Great importance is attached, by believers in Carancini's
phenomena, to the flash-light photographs which were taken at
his seances. Let us, for a moment, consider what their value
is for evidential purposes. Being instantaneous photographs,
they can, by their very nature, only show the levitated object
for a moment. They do not show the events that cause the
object to be in the position in which it is seen.
208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 191o.
We read in Dr. Lancellotti's paper that Carancini's control,
'
Giuseppe,' indicates the exact moment the photographs can be
taken by calling out the word " Fuoco."
Now, what is to prevent a fraudulent medium,—^^just at the
moment that he throws a small object into the air, or after he
has pinned or hooked it to the cabinet curtain, or after he
has placed a heavier object on his shoulders, or on another
point of support,—from calling out the word " Fuoco," or any
other word as a signal for the photograph to be taken at that
convenient moment ? It will be noted that in the photographs
only small objects appear to be floating in the air. All the
heavier ones have a point of support. Carancini himself at
the moment of his alleged levitation, appears to be standing
on his own chair.
It may be said that the medium could not have pro-
duced the phenomena fraudulently, as the photographs show
that his hands were controlled at the time. To this I reply
that although both Carancini's hands were in contact with
those of the controllers at the instant that the photographs
were taken, yet it was quite possible that one of his hands
was free just before he called out the word " Fuoco." I have
ample grounds for making this assertion. These grounds are
based on the careful observations that Mr. Feilding and I were
able to make of the process that Carancini or '
Giuseppe ' resorted
to when he carried out the substitutions of hands at the time
that we were controlling him. It was very interesting to watch
the rapidity with which he replaced his right hand on Mr.
Feilding's immediately after he had brought about a phenomenon.
He would touch us or pull our coats with his free right hand
and immediately afterwards lift his left hand from the back
of Mr. Feilding's and replace it by his right hand, the action
being accompanied by a strong convulsive movement of his body,
by his then violently pulling our hands, in contact with his
own, up into the air, and by the uttering of a loud groan.
Flash-light photographs do not prove the genuineness of a
phenomenon. They merely give us a picture of what is actually
happening at any one time without showing us the preceding
actions of the medium leading up to the event.
In regard to the substitution of hands that was detected at
one of our sittings when the medium professed to be in a trance,
Jan., 1910. Sittings ivith Garanc%ni. 209
if it be asserted that this may have been an action for which the
medium was not responsible, I may repeat that it was performed
at the time with great deliberation and apparent care to avoid
detection, and also that such a trick, to be carried out with
success, requires previous training, which it is difficult to suppose
could have been effected in a trance state.
In conclusion, I would point out that the phenomena obtained
at these seances differed fundamentally from those we witnessed
with Eusapia Palladino at Naples, not only in that Carancini's
phenomena (with the exception of the raps) occurred in com-
plete darkness, whereas with Eusapia Palladino many of the
phenomena took place in light when her hands and her whole
body were in full view, a condition which is of course essential
for any good evidence for supernormality ; but also in that there
was definite positive evidence of fraud in Carancini's case.
During the discussion that followed Mr. Baggally's paper,
Mr. Sydney C. Scott, who had been present at all the sittings
held with Carancini in London, said :
The arrangements of the room in which the sittings were
held had been very carefully made by Mr. Feilding and Mr.
Baggally, and the device of the patches of luminous paint on
the medium's sleeves was an excellent one, enabling the move-
ments of his arms to be seen, even when there was least light.
The manifestations which took place at the sittings when
I was present were of four kinds, viz.:—(1) Eaps or taps,
(2) upsetting a small table, (3) the production of moving lights,
and (4) the writing of some strange characters.
The table at which we sat was a small light deal table,
at one end of which Carancini was placed, flanked closely on
each side by the controllers, who held his hands firmly and
also his legs by wrapping theirs round his.
The raps which took place were faint in the extreme and
could only be detected by listening intently. We all agreed
that the sounds proceeded from the region of the floor and
in the rear of the medium's chair. By sitting on the extreme
front edge of a chair it is quite easy with scarcely any per-
ceptible muscular movement to make the chair tilt forward
and in this way to produce faint taps on the floor. I satisfied
210 Journal of Societij for Psychical Research. Jax.,1910-
myself when acting as one of the controllers that this was the
way the taps were produced, as T could feel slight movements
in the medium's leg, produced by extension and contraction of
tlie muscles which synchronised with the sounds.
With the view of testing this further, I asked Mr. Feilding
to put the medium's chair at a subsequent meeting on a carpet
instead of on the parquet flooring. This was done, and, as we
anticipated, the taps were then of the muffled kind which
might be expected when the legs of the chair struck the iloor
covered with carpet.
The upsetting of the small table only occurred once. Sir
William Crookes was then acting as one of the controllers, and
it was agreed that the occurrence possessed no evidential value,,
as the medium's movements were very convulsive at the
moment, and although his hands were not released and he
was enclosed by the netting cage, yet it seemed quite possible
that he could have tilted the table over with his elbow. The
table was standing near the netting, which had a certain amount
of slack or elasticity and yielded to pressure. On subsequent
occasions the table was put further away from the medium
and never fell over again.
The appearance of the lights also only occurred at one
sitting. On this occasion the medium had asked to be put
inside the cabinet or alcove and a chair was placed there for
him to sit on. After an interval a small spot of light appeared
high up and apparently at the top of the curtain, about the
height the medium could reach easily by standing on his chair..
This light was repeated several times and was occasionally
duplicated. It alternated with the appearance of luminous
patches rather lower down.
At the close of the sitting Mr. Baggally asked Carancini
to allow himself to be searched before leaving the room, a
request to which he readily acceded, and Mr. Baggally and
I accordingly examined him and went through his pockets..
The contents were found to comprise a few unsuspicious articles
and a small box of matches. Without expressing any suspicion
of these, Mr. Baggally with the dexterity of a practised conjuror
possessed himself of a few of the matches, unknown, I think,
to Carancini, who then left the room. As soon as he had
gone Mr. Baggally switched off the electric light and them
Jan., 1910. Sittings with. Carancini. 211
produced the identical effects of the moving spots of light
which we had witnessed during the sitting.
The writing of strange characters happened twice, the writing
on the first occasion being much more regular than on the
second. A marked feature about the first writing was the
speed with which it was produced and its regularity.
The characters, or some of them, bore a resemblance to
certain Greek and Russian characters, but we were told by
Giuseppe, Carancini's alleged control, that they embodied a
message from an individual who lived some "iOOO years ago,
though, as the interpretation was not vouchsafed, we were not
much the wiser. It was obvious that the production of these
complex characters at such a rate of speed in the dark would
certainly require a large amount of practice beforehand, except
on the hypothesis, which seemed untenable, of their being
produced genuinely by external control.
In view of all these experiences, I had arrived at a definite
opinion adverse to the genuineness of all the phenomena which
had occurred during the ten sittings at whicli I was present.
In regard to these sittings I was satisfied not only that
Carancini had cheated, hut that he had cheated all the time
and whenever he could. Thus the results were disappointing,
not only because of the total absence of anything in the
nature of genuine phenomena, but also because of the presence
of fraudulent tricks perpetrated by the medium.

DISCUSSION OF THE NAPLES EEPOET ON
EUSAPIA PALLADINO.^
I.
Mr. Podmore in his paper {Journal S.P.Pi., Dec. 1909) on the
above Eeport limits his analysis to three seances, V., VI., VII.,
and to a certain class of phenomena depending for their evidential
value on the sense of touch alone and to the phenomena at which
one member of the Committee (B.) controlled on the right.
Eor a normal explanation of the phenomena at these three
seances, he says :
" All that we need assume is the deception of a
single person (B.) and a single sense—and that the sense of
touch." 2
From this limited analysis he desires his readers to draw the
conclusion that the phenomena, of whatever nature, at all the
seances, including those at which B. was not present, were of a
non-evidential nature.^
I would say that I entertain the greatest admiration for Mr.
iSee Proceedings S.P.R. Vol. XXIII. pp. 306-569.
'•^Mr. Podmore limits the words "the deception of a single person" to B., as
he says in his paper that the intervals during which C. controlled on the
right of Eusapia were unproductive [of phenomena], therefore C. could not
have been deceived.
^ When dealing with the report as a whole Mr. Podmore definitely states
that the Committee's method of investigation failed. He also says, " I see no
reason to doubt that the criticism made [by me] on these seances will apply
mutatis mutandis to all the rest."
214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.
Podmore's analytical and logical powers, but he will pardon me
for saying that in this case his argument appears to me to lack
logical consistency.
The following propositions
(1) Because on the assumption that a single person was
deceived in his sense of touch, certain phenomena were
non-evidential, therefore the other phenomena which
occurred at other seances, at which B. was not present,
were also non-evidential:
(2) Because certain phenomena, depending for their evidential
value on a single person's sense of touch, were not
evidential, therefore other phenomena witnessed by the
members of the Committee not depending for their
evidential value on their sense of touch alone were also
non-evidential ; .
.
appear to me to be illogical.
Mr. Podmore begins by setting aside certain phenomena, such
as levitations of the table, etc., as by their nature inconclusive.
The distinction he draws appears to me an arbitrary one, and I am
unable to see any justification for it.^ Further he limits himself
for the details of his criticism to the phenomena of the three
seances V., VI., VII., but includes in his conclusion the phenomena
of all the other seances. The words that he uses, " this method
of investigation . . . has failed," can but mean that no pheno-
mena whatever were of any evidential value.
I think that this sweeping condemnation of all the phenomena
—no matter of what nature—justifies me in bringing forward
any incident from any seance in answer to his criticisms, and in
what follows I propose to use this liberty.
Mr. Podmore says
To analyse with care the whole mass of evidence would be an
extremely laborious undertaking. There are only five completely
^The reason he gives is "difficulty of isolation," but surely Mr. Podmore
does not mean to imply that in every case the phenomena thus set aside
(1) were so mixed up and entangled with others of a different character, or
(2) that they always occurred in contact with Eusapia's physical organism, so
that it is impossible to find in the Report a clear cut statement of the isolated
occurrence of any one. If Mr. Podmore attaches either of the above meanings
to the word '
isolation '
the first is at once refuted by the report of seance
IX., 10.13 to 10.2.3, —to give only one example, —and the second by the report
of seance XI. 10.18, —to give also only one example.
Feb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Pallaclino. 215
successful seances —seances, that is, which include the whole range of
phenomena, from tilts of the table to phantom heads—viz., V., VI.,
VII., VIII., and XI. But at seance VIII. and XL, except for an
unproductive hour at the beginning of seance VIII., one side of Eusapia
was under the control of a visitor.
Mr. Podmore uses here the words " unproductive hour " in an
arbitrary sense, for during this very hour, amongst other pheno-
mena, the following are reported.^
Seance VIII., 10.15. F. The table tilts towards medium and then a
complete levitation of it.
F. Her hands on the table holding and above C.'s and my hands.
Her left foot on mine.
C. Her right foot was just touching my left foot. My left knee
pressing against her right knee.
10.18. Two complete levitations of the table cloiselj^ following one
upon the other.
F. She had asked all except the controllers to take their hands
off the table, and they had accordingly sat back. My
right hand across both her knees. Her left foot un-
doubtedly on mine. Both her hands on the table and
visible.
C. Her right foot pressing against my left foot. My left knee
pressing against her right knee. I passed my hand
between her body and the table several times [showing
that there was no hook or attachment. C, Dec. 11/08].
I do not bring forward the above phenomena for evidential
purposes, as visitors sat at the table (of whose honour, however,
I do not entertain the slightest doubt), but to show that,
contrary to his statement, this hour was not unproductive.
This may appear captious criticism on my part, but as Mr.
Podmore requires absolute completeness in the description of the
control by the members of the Committee, so should he be
absolutely complete in his criticism and not exclude certain kinds
of phenomena.
I continue to quote from his paper
Seances V, VI., and VII., represent therefore at once the high
water mark of the phenomena and the best conditions of control.
f—
1 1 give the description of the control in detail in order to save the reader
the trouble of having to refer to the report.
216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.
This is misleadino- as the best conditions of control did not
take place only at these seances. (See amongst others seance IX.,
10.14, 10.16, 10.17. Complete levitation of seance table when
strongest light was on and Eusapia's hands were visible and also
her body down to her feet. Seance IX., 12.38—0. grasped by a
complete hand through curtain, Eusapia's hands controlled and
visible on the table and feet controlled.)
Mr. Podniore says
Two conclusions at once emerge from this closer analysis.
(1) That Eusapia is afraid of Mr. Carrington. Twice in the course
of these seances he was, by Eusapia's request, displaced from the
control of the right side ; so that in fact save for two brief and
unproductive intervals at the beginning of seances V. and VII.
respectively, he was not allowed, during these three seances, to sit at
Eusapia's right.
Although it is not stated in the Eeport, it is a fact that Mr.
Carrington was ill and was compelled to keep his bed for some
time during the course of these seances, and when Eusapia asked
him to retire from his control at seances V., VII., she said that
she did so because his vitality was very low.
I cannot of course either substantiate or contradict Mr. Pod-
more's conclusion that Eusapia was afraid of Mr. Carrington, but
I would ask, if she was afraid, why she allowed him to control
her on the right during the whole of seance IX., when many
phenomena occurred on his side, and she did not ask him to
retire.
I continue to quote from the same portion of Mr. Podmore's
paper
So that, in fact, save for two brief and unproductive intervals
at the beginning of seances V. and VII. respectively,
The word " unproductive " is here again used arbitrarily, for
in the interval at the beginning of seance V., when C. was
controlling on the right and E. on the left, amongst other
phenomena, the following is reported
10.13. Partial levitation on the two legs away from medium.
P. Both [E.'s] hands were oif the table at the time the table
went up and were clenched at a distance of about three
or four inches from the table, slightly below it. The
Feb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 217
table remained up and then fell back. My right hand
was on both her knees. I was perfectly certain of her
left foot.
C. I have my left foot on her right clearly. My left knee
pressing against her right.
And in the interval at the beginning of seance VII., 9.47,
when C. was controlling on the right and F. on the left, occurred
that most remarkable phenomenon, the bulging of Eusapia's
dress, which took place in full light when her hands were
visible to all, and she showed us that the controllers were
holding different feet and that there was no mechanism under
her dress (see C.'s description of foot control and B.'s note
to seance VII.). Therefore Mr. Podmore has clearly omitted
to notice that these intervals were not unproductive.
Mr. Podmore concludes further
(2) That at these three seances as a rule she preferred to make
use of her right limbs.
The words " as a rule" would imply that sometimes she made
use of her left limbs. There is an inconsistency here with
his assertion at the end of his criticism.
For the three most successful test seances [V., VI., VII.] all
that we need assume is the deception of a single person [i.e. B.,
who controlled Eusapia's right limbs] and a single sense—and that
the sense of touch.
deferring to the same portion of his criticism, I read
(2) That at these three seances, as a rule, she preferred to
make use of her right limbs. Whether this performance is character-
istic of her seances generally I am unable to say ; but the Committee
of the Institut General Psychologique reported that Eusapia suffered
from a painful corn on her right foot, which rendered her intolerant
of the more effective control of that foot, viz. by placing it under
the foot of the controller.
I do not know what object Mr. Podmore had in making
use of this sentence unless it is that he wishes his readers to
infer that Eusapia was intolerant of her right foot being
1 See my previous foot-note regarding Mr. Podmore's limitation of the words
" the deception of a single person " to B.
218 Journal of Society for Psycliiccd Research. Feb., 1910.
controlled in this manner at these three seances. I have just
quoted above C.'s report of his control of Eusapia's foot
(Seance V., 10.13) in which he makes use of these words,
" I have my left foot on her right clearly." This shows that
the inference of her intolerance in this respect, at these three
seances, is incorrect.
For another occasion on which the medium's right foot
was under the controller's left foot, see seance I., 11.44 (F. My
left foot was pressing strongly on hers).
Mr. Podmore goes on to say :
...
Setting aside the simpler and commoner phenomena—levitation
of tables, bulging of medium's dress, movements of curtains, thumps
and raps—which are so difficult to isolate as not in any case to
afford a crucial test—I challenge the Committee to point to a single
phenomenon (grasp of liaiid, transportation of object from cabinet,
or appearance of head, hand, or other similar object) presented at
these three seances [V., VL, VII.] which could not be explained
on the assumption that Eusapia succeeded in freeing the right hand,
or possibly, in some instances, the right foot.
As there was no difficulty in isolating the phenomena of
levitation of tables, bulgings of medium's dress, etc., at our
seances, Mr. Podmore's setting aside of these as stated above
on this ground does not appear justified. Inasmuch as some
of these occurred under the most crucial test conditions, I
cannot set them aside when considering his challenge.
There appears to be an implication in the challenge ; it is
this : All the phenomena of the nature which Mr. Podmore
instances (grasp of hand, etc., etc.) were carried out by the
right hand or right foot of Eusapia. This implication is for-
tified by the sentence at the end of his criticism, in which
he says
—" For the three most successful test st^^ances at any
rate, all that we need assume is the deception of a single
person [who was controlling the right limbs of the medium]
and a single sense, and that the sense of touch."
Now, if it can be shown that phenomena of the nature
mentioned in Mr. Podmore's challenge occurred at these three
seances, which could be explained on the assumption that
Eusapia succeeded in freeing her left hand or possibly her left
foot, the implication falls to the ground.
Feb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia PaUadino. 219
I proceed to bring forward some of the.se phenomena
Seance V., 11.38. •
-
C. I hold it [my hand] about two feet above her [medium's]
head. . . .
C. Now I feel a hand pushing against my right hand.
F. Her left foot on my right. My left hand on her knees.
C. Again a liand pushes my right hand ;
again a hand pushes
strongly. I felt resistance as I pressed the curtain
gently.
B. Her right hand in my left hand on the table. . . .
P. Her two hands are at least two feet apart.
Note.—(F. had previously reported that he had hold of her
left hand, but it was not stated that her left hand was visible
nor where it was.)
Seance VI. after 12.6 a.m. F. stands to the left of C. [who controls
on left of medium] and leans over with his left hand outstretched
about 2i- feet above and to the left of the medium's head. Immedi-
ately after
F. I am touched by something coming straight on the points of
my fingers.
12.11 a.m.
F. I am touched again, I am taken hold of by fingers and I
can feel the nails quite plainly.
C. Her head pressing against my head. I am absolutely holding^
her left hand on the table.
3. I am absolutely certain that her right hand is on my left
hand on her right knee.
Note.—Her left hand not stated to be visible.
Seance VI., 12.17. F., C. and B. see a white thing over
Eusapia's head and immediately after a hand pulls B.
12.19.
C. At that time I had hold of her left hand in my right on
my corner of the table and I could feel her arm up as
far as the elbow ...
^ Should Mr. Podmore say that Eusajjia could Bot have had her left hand
free, as C. reported that he was holding it, I would reply that Eusapia could
not have had her rigJit hand free whenever B. reported that he was holding it.
220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.
B. Her right hand was resting on my left hand on the table
and I was holding her thumb.
Hotc.—Her left arm and hand not stated to be visible.
From the above considerations it will be seen that Mr.
Podmore's implication that all the phenomena at these three
seances were carried out by Eusapia's right hand, or right foot,
is an incorrect one. He should have challenged the Committee
to point to a single phenomenon (grasp of hand, etc., etc.) pre-
sented at these three seances which could not be explained on
the assumption that Eusapia succeeded in freeing her right or
left hand or, possibly in some instances, her right or left foot.
I now proceed to consider the challenge. Mr. Podmore excludes
levitations of the table, bulgings of medium's dress, bulgings of
curtains, thumps and raps, and also other phenomena, e.g. move-
ments of objects in the cabinet. The challenge to have been
a complete one should have included these, as they occurred at
these three seances, and they are as much phenomena as those
to which he wishes the challenge to be restricted, and they
should be taken into consideration when endeavouring to arrive
at a correct conclusion as to whether phenomena of the nature
that he mentions, and other phenomena, could have been
explained on the assumption that Eusapia succeeded in freeing
the right hand or the right foot.
I will enumerate some phenomena which will meet the
challenge in the restricted form and also in the complete form
which should have been adopted by Mr. Podmore.
Seance V., 11.51. Transportation of small table from cabinet
between the left of medium and F.
JVote.—Eusapia was visible and motionless while this was
going on. Her legs under the seance table. Her back towards
the cabinet. The back of her chair between her and the cabinet.
No possibility of substitution of hands or feet. I reported at
the time that her right was in my left resting on the table and
her right foot on my left, and that I felt her knee against my
knee. Assuming that her right hand, or right foot, was free,
it was a physical impossibility to effect the transportation with
her right hand, or right foot, on the left side of the medium in
the manner that it took place.

F. She squeezes my hand and the curtain comes out and covers
my chair.
F. Her hand was about 2J- feet from the curtain and her foot
on mine as before.
B. Same control as before [i.e. her right hand was on the table
on my corner and visible. My left hand on her two
knees and her right foot on the toes of my left foot].
Her back was at least a foot from the curtain.
JSfotc.—The meditiDi sat motionless, her legs .under the seance
table. Both her hands were visible at the time, therefore her
right hand was not employed in the production of this pheno-
menon, and it was a physical impossibility for her to make the
left-hand curtain come out and cover F.'s chair with her right
foot even if it were free. The seance table being turned broad
ways towards the medium, F.'s chair was not in close proximity
to her (see diagram, p. -468 of our report).
After 10.30, about 10.33.
F. Immediately after she held my hand out away from her
towards the small stool, which is somewhere (under the
curtains), I do not know where, and it jumped.

F. Both her hands are free but cjuite visible. Her left foot is
on mine. ^

B. I also see both her hands, free, and both her knees, which
are under the table, and her right foot is on my left
foot.
Note.—iSTot only were her hands visible but her knees also.
They were under the table between its narrow legs. Eusapia
sat with her back to the cabinet. If her right foot had been
free it would have been impossible for her to use it (her legs
being under the table in front of her) to make the stool
jnmp behind her inside the cabinet. She did not use her
right hand as it was visible. . .: ! •.

To a reader of our report who does not approach the con-
sideration of the phenomena under the assumption that the
Members of the Committee were continuously hallucinated or
that they had lost their sense of touch, during the whole
course of the sittings, the phenomena (which for their fraudulent
a2

production would have necessitated the use of one of Eusapia's
hands), at the seances V., VI., VIL, when B. reported that
her right hand was in his left or that he was holding or
feeling her right thumb, would have offered evidence that
Eusapia did not use her right hand for their production.
See amongst others, e.g.

but to a reader who approaches the consideration of the
phenomena under the contrary assumption evidence of this
kind will be useless. The argument between him and the Members
of the Committee would narrow itself to an assertion on his
part (he not having been present at the seances) that they
were constantly hallucinated, or deceived, and on their part
(they having been present) to an assertion that they were not.
Figuratively speaking, it would be arguing along two parallel
lines which can never meet.
I now leave Mr. Podmore's challenge and proceed to comment
on his statements as to the conditions of control.
It will be noticed on perusing these statements that Mr.
Podmore is very particular as to the precise wording of the
various controls, and he places great importance on the difference
(not in the nature only, but in the wording also) of the
control of the left and the right hand of Eusapia. As he is
so hypercritical in this last respect I am reluctantly compelled
to imitate him and to be equally hypercritical with regard to
the words which he alleges were used in the description of
some of the controls.
His first statement is to the following effect
Throughout these three seances, whereas Eusapia's left hand is
generally reported as lying in or being held or grasped by the hand
Feb., 1910. The Naples Repm^t on Eusapia Palladino. 223
of the controller on that side, the right hand as a rule is reported as
resting on or lying on, or lying under, the other controller's left hand.
The difference, in view of Eusapia's known propensities for cheating
by substitution of hands, is important.
Note.—jSTot once is it stated, during the whole course of
these three seances, that Eusapia's left hand is lying in the
hand of the controller on the left. Not once is the statement
made that her left hand is grasjjed hy the controller on that
side.
Only nine times (not as a rule) is it stated that her right
hand was resting on the other controller's left hand. Not once
is it mentioned that her right hand was lying on the con-
troller's left hand. Not once is it reported that her right
hand was lying under the controller's left hand.
Mr. Podmore's next statement reads
It happens unfortunatelj^ that while the control of the left hand
is generally stated precisely e.g. " left hand held in my right visibly
on the table "—that of the right is often stated in general terms,
such as "Control perfect," or "Control as before." Frequently at the
critical moment the statement is incomplete. Sometimes no state-
ment at all is forthcoming.
Note.—Only six times (not generally) is it stated that the
medium's left hand is held in controller's right visibly on the ted)le.
Only four times (not often) did B. use the words Control
perfect. The controller on the left used the words " my control
is quite complete." The definite words " Control as before " were
used 16 times by B., but Mr. Podmore omits to say that the
controller on the left made use of the same words 12 times.
The statement was made incompletely by B. 17 times, but
Mr. Podmore omits to notice that it was made incompletely
by the left controller also 17 times. As regards no state-
ment at all being forthcoming, I would observe that this
occurred about an equal number of times on the left and on
the right.
The phenomena followed each other sometimes so rapidly
that there was not time to dictate the control, and when the
controllers were able to do so, they were more intent on the
security of the control than on the precise words that they
should use in describing it.
224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.
As Mr. Podmore excluded from his challenge certain pheno-
mena which offered good evidence for a supernormal force
being at work, so in the above statements has he excluded from
his consideration B.'s descriptions of his best conditions of
control at seances V., VI., VII., when he reported that Eusapia's
right hand was visible, that both her hands were visible, that
her right hand was in his left visibly, that he was holding her
thumb, that he was feeling her thumb, that he was holding
her right hand in his left. Mr. Podmore's criticism consequently
is defective and gives his readers a wrong impression as to
the severity, actually exercised by B. in his control of Eusapia's
right hand.
Ptegarding his next statement. No. 3, which begins with the
words
(3) On many occasions it is reported that the right hand curtain
has blown out over the controller on that side so as to cover his
head, or his hand in contact with Eusapia's right.
I will say that I agree with Mr. Podmore's observations on
the imperfection of the report in recording some of the times
that the curtain was blown over, or remained on, or was
removed from the hand of the controller on the right ; but I
would observe that at the time that it covered my hand I was
most rigorous, assuring myself continually that it was the
medium's right hand by feeling her thumb, equally when her
hand was on mine as when mine was on hers, also assuring
myself that it was a living hand by its warmth, movement
and responses to my pressure.
• On the one occasion (not on the many occasions, as Mr.
Podmore says) that the curtain was blown over my head I
immediately removed it from that position (see V., 10.57—10.58
p.m.), and on the only occasion that it was placed between
the medium's and my hand, I at once took it from between our
hands, felt her bare flesh, and squeezed her thumb (see seance
VI., about 12.16 a.m.).
If all the phenomena at all the seances had taken place
with one of the controllers' hands under the curtain, then (on
the assumption that they had lost their sense of touch) Mr.
Podmore's implied assertion that Eusapia had one of her hands
free would have weight ; but the majority of the phenomena
Feb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 225
occurred when the curtain was not covering one of their hands
nevertheless Mr. Podmore condemns all the phenomena as non-
evidential, even those which took place in full light, when
both the medium's hands were clearly seen and at the same
time her body was in view down to her feet, while the con-
trollers were assured by tactual examination or by their sense
of sight that no mechanism was being brought into play and
when it was certain that there was no accomplice. On these
last phenomena he has not a word to say (see my final note in
the Eeport for examples of these). ...
I pass on to Mr. Podmore's next statement
(4) Eusapia is reported as occasionally releasing one hand
momentarily and replacing it. This procedure is not reserved
exclusively for the right hand. In seance V., for instance, (10.44|^
and 11.36 p.m.) her left hand is twice released. But her right hand
is released more frequently and to more purpose (see e.g. VI., 12.4,
12.30 ;
VII., 10.54). On each of these occasions after control is
renewed it is found that both Eusapia's hands are on her knees, the
right hand lying on the hand of the controller on that side, the left
hand held by the other controller. These of course are Eusapia's
usual preliminaries for substitution of hands. And on each of these
three occasions the release of the hand was followed in a few
minutes by the appearance of a " head " or nondescript object from
between the curtains. At VI., 11.40 (about), the release of the right
hand is followed as usual by a nondescript appearance from between
the curtains, but the right hand is reported on the table under the
curtain [and her left hand visible on the left controller's hand on
the table].
The letters " e.^/." in the parenthesis (see e.g. YL, 12.4, 12.30 ;
YIL, 10.54) would imply that there were several other occasions
on which, after renewal of control of Eusapia's right hand, the
medium's and controllers' hands were in the positions that he
mentions.
There was only one other occasion, VII., 10.59. I must
point out that at seance VII., 10.54, it is not stated that
Eusapia's right hand was released ; therefore Mr. Podmore should
not have included this occasion in his parenthesis, and conse-
quently the appearance of a nondescript object at VII.,
10.57—10.58 cannot be taken into account when referring to
a release of Eusapia's right hand. The words used in the
226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.
Eeport are :
" Medium asked if she could touch the curtain
for a moment, but she did not attach anything to it." It
should be noted that Mr. Podmore makes no mention (with the
exception of VI., 11.40 about) of the occasions on which a head
or nondescript object appeared from between the curtains when
there was no possibility of a substitution, as both the medium's
hands were controlled apart, or separately, on the table, or
one hand was controlled on the table and the other on her
lap (see seances VI., 11.47 (about)— 12.17 to 12.19—12.40;
VII., 11.30). All that Mr. Podmore's statement really amounts
to is to show that on two occasions, at seance VI., 12.4 and
12.30, when a head and nondescript object appeared (after
renewal of control of Eusapia's right hand), her hands and
those of the controllers were in a position that might have
enabled her to carry out a substitution. That she did so he
does not prove.
Mr. Podmore proceeds to say :
If the reader wishes to verify these statements, let him closely
study the sequence of events in s6ance VII., 10.54 to end, and let
him endeavour from the record to make out the exact nature of the
control exercised on Eusapia's right hand at eacli point, its position,
whether on the table or in her lap, and whether or not it was held
under the curtain. The defects of control, it will be found, culminated
in this stance. So did the phenomena.
Mr. Podmore is justified in pointing out the defectiveness
of the report as regards its recording whether or not Eusapia's
hand remained under the curtain at seance VII. (not from
10.54 but from 11.17; see his statement No. 3 and my
comments on that statement), to end of this seance.
But his words
Let him [the reader] endeavour from the record to make out the
exact nature of the control exercised on Eusapia's right hand at
each point, its position, whether on the table or in her lap,
are misleading, for any reader who refers to the Eeport will find
that all B.'s descriptions of his control of Eusapia's right hand,
with the exception of ten, were quite definite. I think he will
also conclude that the control was adequate. Thus
Seance VII. 10.54. [No phenomena, therefore no description of
control dictated by B.]
Feb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 227
10.57. B. Her right hand, which I am absolutely sure is her right
hand, as I feel the fingers, rests on my left hand, both
resting on her right lap.
10.58. Her right hand on my left hand, both on my knee.
11.2. During the levitation I held her right hand in my left hand,
resting on her lap.
11.13. She had her right hand on my left hand, always resting on
her knee.
11.17. She has her right hand in my left hand resting on the
table.
11.20. During the whole of this phenomenon her right hand was
resting on my left hand on the table.
11.30. My control of foot and hand is exactly the same as before.
12.25. She holds my left hand with her right hand. She squeezes
my hand while this levitation takes place. My hand was
also on her knee in her hand.
One word on Mr. Podmore's last statement in his paper
The above considerations suggest that, for the three most successful
test seances at any rate, all that we need assume is the deception
of a single person and a single sense—and that the sense of touch.
I would point out the inconsistency of using the words " a
single person," as, if Mr. Podmore's theory holds, obviously not
a single person but two people were deceived. Not only B. but
also C. sat on Eusapia's right at seances V. and VII., and
phenomena took place at both seances at the time that C.
controlled.
Mr. Podmore's conclusion as to the non-evidential value of
the phenomena of all our seances is based on an assumption,
viz., that each of the members of the Committee was con-
tinually hallucinated or deceived. This hypothesis has been
dealt with, in anticipation, on pp. 341 to 344 of our Eeport.
Mr. Podmore's paper is an admirable example of special
pleading. He limits his analysis to three seances, confines his
criticism to phenomena depending for their evidential value on
the sense of touch of a single individual (B.), and passes over
in silence not only the phenomena depending evidentially on the
same sense of the other members of the Committee, but also
the other phenomena of all the seances which did not depend
on that sense alone for their evidential value, but also on the
228 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.
sense of sight. For there were many cases in which Eusapia's
hands as well as the whole of her body down to her feet were
seen, and also cases when the hands were both seen and felt.
Mr. Podmore's method of criticism as applied to our Eeport^
has failed, as it does not take account of these last phenomena.'^

^
Mr. F. C. Constable's letter in the Journal for December,
1909, on the recent experiments with Eusapia deserves atten-
tion. It would certainly be very satisfactory if some fundamental
change in the conditions of the supposed "manifestations" could
be effected which should make their authenticity or otherwise
depend no longer on " human " but on " material " control. But
while striving to attain this aim, we should not leave out of
account several circumstances which may have a decisive import-
ance. And first of all, we ought not to lay down a jjriori rules,
but to try and elicit them, {i.e. the rules which regulate the sup-
posed "phenomena"), from apparently well-established facts. For
instance, it would be, I think, rash and anti-scientific to start from
the assumption that, if genuine, the "phenomena" must occur in a
tolerably good light. For after all we know nothing about it,
theoretically speaking. What we are entitled to in this connection
will be only this : we have a right to try to ascertain from the
evidence in our possession how many well-attested instances of
"phenomena" occurring in the light we have on record already.
And I believe the results of such an enquiry would be chiefly
negative. For what do we know, strictly speaking, of the amount
of " light," e.g., at D. D. Home's seances 1 We certainly have
evidence that it was very poor in a good many cases, and, generally
speaking, we have but little precise information on this point. And
—as I had occasion to point out elsewhere—I do not consider an
ordinary " light " seance of Eusapia's with the curtain to be much
superior evidentially to a totally dark seance. There may of course
be exceptions—and the recent Naples sittings may belong to that
category—but they will be rame aves.
1 1 remind the reader of Mr. Podmore's words :
" I see no reason to doubt that
the criticism made [by me] of these seances [V., VI., VII.], will apply wiHia^/.s
mutandis to all the rest."
-For the relative importance that I attach to these last phenomena for
evidential purposes, as compared with other phenomena, see my final note in
the Report.
Feb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 229
So much for the Editor's remark as to the desirability of a "good
light." As to Mr. Constable's suggestion that in future experiments
Eusapia should be placed " in a cage of the same material as that
of the curtain," the objects to be moved remaining outside the
" cage "
—why I think the idea is a very good one, and ought to be
tried at the next opportunity. And perhaps E. P. will not always
decline to submit to some such test, as she unfortunately did
at Cambridge.
This being so, 1 must still point out
(1) That we have no proof nen deplaise to Mr. Constable—that
E. P. can affect objects through the curtain—or rather curtains, for
there were two of them, leaving an opening in the middle. Most of
the things seem to have happened as if the medium bad one hand
free to produce them, and I see little or no evidence of direct
supernormal action through any material obstacle which was interposed.
(2) And here another remark. // they are genuine, I am inclined
to believe that some day we shall find that these strange " manifes-
tations " are produced not so much by " psychic force " —whatever
that may mean—as by ephemeral, enigmatic protuberances projected
momentarily from the medium's body ;
protuberances of various
degrees of density—from " fluid " to " hand "
—which spring inta
existence and vanish in the twinkling of an eye.
If so, we can easily understand :
(rt) That light mai/ have a deteriorating influence on those
ephemeral organisms (of course, just as it may not : one hypothesis
being as probable as the other).
(b) That material obstacles—screens, etc. —may present to such
" pseudo-limbs " almost insuperable difficulties. For acting through
them would almost involve "passage of matter through matter"—
phenomenon for which we have no good evidence (just as we
have practically none for " apports ").
(c) That the phenomena would invariably occur in close proximity
to the medium.
I do not believe the existence of such "pseudo-limbs" to be
already established. I seriously doubt them to be "facts in nature."'
But still I do see some evidence which makes me pause in my
scepticism and suspend my judgment.
But, I repeat, if such things exist, the three circumstances I
have just pointed out, suspicious as they may be in themselves,
become easily intelligible and lend themselves to a rational inter-
pretation.
230 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 191o.
AVe should therefore be careful not to lay down the standard to
which the phenomena should, in our opinion, conform, but rather
endeavour to find out a modus vivendi in which should be united at
the same time (a) the conditions apparently necessary for the
production of the supposed " manifestations," and (b) precautions
suflficiently stringent to make deception impossible.
I see some grounds for believing such a compromise practicable,
though probably not very easy to achieve at once.
Some people will perhaps think the laws which regulate such
phenomena very unsatisfactory. So do I. I should much prefer
ithem to be altogether different. But many of the natural laws in
force on the surface of our planet are similarly unsatisfactory—and
-even distinctly bad—at first sight. Many of us feel we could do
better ; and yet we have to submit to these laws, and our protests
are of no avail. " Metapsychical " laws may perhaps be of the same
ipattern.
In conclusion, may I say a few words about the report of the
l^aples sittings printed in Proceedings, Part LIX. ?
I think this report very remarkable. It is certainly one of the
Ijest, if not the best, that has ever appeared on the subject. No
more competent investigators than Messrs. Feilding, Baggally and
Carrington could be desired ; the report is as full as it could be
made ; the precautions adopted seem to have been in many cases
excellent ; some of the " supernormal " incidents appear beyond the
possibility of cavil ; and finally, the " collective hallucination
"
hypothesis is treated as it sliould be.
The only really serious objection that can be made is in my
opinion the following : the foot-control seems to have been not quite
adequate in some cases.
Is it not a pity, for instance, that it was not more thorough in
the incidents described on pp. 553 and 564 1 Mr. Baggally, we are
told, was holding hoth the hands of the medium and yet experiencing
a series of touches and pulls through the curtain. I wish we had
2}0sitive evidence this could not have been done by the medium's
foot. Mr. Baggally gives us his grounds for believing that this
could not have been the case (p. 565)—but his reasons do not appeal
to my mind as being quite irrefutable. I should prefer something
else—and this " something else " in the present instance is missing.
And so the best case of the series (so far as " spirit-hands " are
concerned) is spoiled. There are, it is true, other instances, but
xione perhaps so striking.
Feb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 231
The account of the seance in question (the eleventh one of the
series) has reminded me of one I had with Sambor in March, 1899.
Here also a curtain was used, the medium sitting in the opening.
The room was lighted by a small lamp, shaded with books and
turned very low (it was placed in a corner of the room on the floor).
Under these conditions, the medium's hands being grasped and
visible almost the whole time, his head being also visible—in short
the hand and head control leaving almost ^ nothing to be desired
not only were two objects (a small album and a small log) brought
upon the seance-table (the latter visibly coming down upon it
almost under my eyes, for an appreciable period of time, though,
it is true, a very short one)—but Sambor's left-hand neighbour
experienced a series of pulls and contacts which must have resembled
those described by Mr. Baggally. And yet, I confess, I was not
particularly impressed by these incidents. It has always seemed to
me possible that the medium's foot may have had something to do
with them ; and here also, as in Mr. Baggally's case, lack of precise
information as to the foot-control has been a most serious draw-
back.
I will add that after reading the Naples report, coming as it
does on the top of the far less satisfactory Paris report and a series
of isolated observations—I feel that there is at last one of Eusapia's
"phenomena" which, to my mind, is proved: I refer to her most
remarkable table-levitations. I consider that after all these investi-
gations the onus prohcmdi in this respect now devolves upon those
who maintain these levitations to be spurious —not upon those who
believe them to be authentic. This is already something.

The following pages are written in agreement with Mr. Podmore's
view that the Report shows how unsatisfactory such an investigation
must be, however good the investigators, under the conditions imposed hy
the medium. For these are such as in no case to preclude the
possibility of fraud, which may be undetected even by skilful con-
jurers. It therefore becomes in order for an outsider to ask whether
the cogency of the evidence here presented on Eusapia's side is
sufficient to outweigh the many suspicious circumstances so frankly
stated by the Committee, including obvious attempts at trickery

232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.
{e.g. pp. 338, 383, 400, 543). It is a great thing to possess the
shorthand report taken at the time, with its wealth of impartial
detail, and a comparison of this report with later accounts shows,
incidentally, how impossible it is to remember afterwards exactly
what took place at the moment. For example, I do not see how
to make consistent with the shorthand report F.'s later notes about
the substitution of hands and the seizing of Mrs. H.'s wrist at
Seance XI. (10.30 and 12.11.)
(p. 540) Shorthand report :
" F. Substitution of hands !
Mrs. H. / thought that I still had hold of the medium's left hand."^
Later note :
"I asked Mrs. H. if she held the medium's left. She said, 'No,,
she has made a snbstitution.' F."
(p. 549) Shorthand report:
" F. Mrs. H.'s left hand tvas seized by the wrist by a hand and
dragged across the table." (The only contemporaneous record.)
Later note
" I was looking at Mrs. H.'s left hand when it suddenly made a
movement across the table. / did not see any hand holding it. F."
Again, there appear certain discrepancies between the report and
the account given by Mr. Carrington (C.) in M'Clure's Magazine.
(October, 1909). See below on the levitations of the table, the
cold breeze, and the movements of the milking-stool.
In the report itself nothing strikes a careful reader more than
the incessant changes in the position of Eusapia's hands, feet, and
legs, {e.g. Seance V., 11.13-11.18, apparently four changes in five
minutes; ox ibid. 11.28-11.30, three changes in two). And it is
just the moments of change, whether announced by Eusapia or not,
that might provide the opportunity for the phenomena, Heeting as
these are. For example we have this entry at Seance VI.., 12.30 :
" F. She saw me holding my hand up against the cabinet waiting
to be touched. She therefore let go of B.'s hand, saying that she
was going to do so, put her hand inside the curtain and took hold
of mine through the curtain, saying 'This is my hand,' and she
then resumed hold of B.'s hand.
C. I saw a head come out from the curtains slowly and within
six inches of my head, and it stayed out about two seconds and
then went back."
Now between the moment when Eusapia took hold of F.'s hand
inside the curtain and her resumption of B.'s, an appreciable time
. , • , 1 Italics mine throughout.
Feb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 233
must have elapsed. Would it not have been quite long enough
for the fugitive phenomenon observed by C. ?
Again in the remarks on Seance V. (p. 420) we read
"From 10.52 onwards there were a series of movements of the
small table and of other objects behind the curtain, culminating at
11.8 by the small table striking B. on the shoulder and upsetting
completely, the medium being rigorously held, visible and motionless."
The inference might be drawn that this condition endured through
the sixteen minutes in question. But in the shorthand report we
find (pp. 428, 429) :
" 10.58. B. The curtain is still over my hand,"
evidently, from the report at 10.57, the hand which had been
held by the medium, so that one of hers would also be hidden and
not visible ihen. Moreover, from the reports at 10.54, 10.55, 11.0,
and 11.4, it is clear that both her legs were incessantly in motion,
e.g. one taken down off F.'s knees, then the two enclosing F.'s leg,
then the left "kicking backwards and forwards," the right "making
a rhythmic movement," and so on. It is after the little table has
struck B. at 11.8 that the medium appears to become motionless.
But the important point to note is what she was doing just before,
when she was anything but that.
The holding at its best consisted of her feet being on their feet,
her right hand being in B.'s left, imder the curtain, and her left hand
Tjeing held, not continuously, by F.'s right (cf. F. 11.0 with F. 11.5). ;
It is hard to understand how, under the circumstances, the Com-
mittee can be "absolutely certain" which of Eusapia's feet is
touching theirs, except at the moments when they feel them with
their hands. And this they cannot do continuously. When a woman
is prepared to trick, as we know Eusapia is, it is surely impossible
always to tell merely by the pressure of her foot on yours, or yours
on hers, which one you have got. Moreover, it cannot but be felt
suspicious that the ladies, when searching Eusapia, found that her
boots "were only buttoned by the top button" (p. 505). This certainly
suggests preparation for slipping her feet in and out, leaving the
boots to keep their place meanwhile in contact with the controllers'
feet. If this were skilfully done it would be almost impossible for
a controller to detect, except by feeling with his hands or free foot,
since if he moved the foot that had been placed in contact with
Eusapia's he would run the risk of losing control. She might,
in short, under certain circumstances, practically imprison a con-
troller's foot by her empty boot.
Eusapia's incessant motion helps, among other considerations, to
234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.
make it seem likely that, as Mr. Podmore appears to suggest, she
substituted a dummy hand for her right during Seances V., VI.,
and VII., when she got the curtain over the table, obscuring her
right arm and B.'s left. The Committee note (p. 326) how skilfully
she can perform her ordinary substitution and how hard it is to
detect by touch alone. It is curious, too, when the curtain is thus
over the table to read in the report (Seance V.): "11.14. F. I
have got hotlh hands of the medium," and immediately afterwards,
"11.18. B. My right hand control was perfect."
Various other questions suggest themselves about the phenomena
that most impressed the Committee (see pp. 331-340).
These questions are put with the reserve incumbent on any critie
not present at the seances : they are intended chiefly to fix attention
on the inevitable, and important, gaps in the evidence available.
Puips, p. 334 (4).
On one occasion it looks as though she might have employed a
confederate, and that is when the raps were made at the end of the
last Seance (XL), on a closed door into B.'s room (p. 554), "the only
really evidential raps obtained throughout the whole series "
(p. 537).
Now,
((() There was no member of the Committee in B.'s room at the-
time.
•
{h) From the plan facing p. 345 (Fig. III.) it appears that there
was another door from B.'s room leading out into the hall ; and
that this door was not locked. (Even if it had been, it could have
been opened with a skeleton key.)
(c) As the door from the seance room into B.'s, —the door on
which the raps were heard—was " permanently locked and secured
with tape " (p. 345), it would not have been possible to detect the
confederate by suddenly opening it.
(cl) The incident occurred at the very last of the seances, by
which time Eusapia and her friends could have become thoroughly
acquainted with the arrangement of the rooms and doors.
(e) The close of the seance was plainly marked by the lights-
being turned up and three of the company going into the room on
the other side (C.'s room). Apparently, however, Signor Zingaropoli,.
Eusapia's friend, (p. 536) remained in the seance room.
Now might not Eusajjia have arranged with little risk for a
confederate to slip into B.'s room at the end of the stance, and>
at some preconcerted signal, produce the noises she required 1
Feb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 235
It may be significant that when Eusapia was asked by F. to
repeat the raps she appears to have failed, at least partially. But
the shorthand report ceases before this, and the notes of F. and
Mrs. H. are conflicting. F. says (December 20th), " She made three
or four gestures and no raps followed. Then she made a final
gesture and a loud rap foUotved."
Mrs. H. writes (December Slth), to the effect that at first Eusapia
"failed to produce them"—(the raps) —"again," and then, after
seizing the curtain, " made the usual gestures and produced the raps,
thoiogh feebly "
(p. 554).
Levitations, p. 331 (1).
Is there a single undeniable case of table levitation with no con-
tact at all, and with the table remaining long enough in the air
to preclude the possibility of its being tossed up or pulled up, and
then let go 1 I will take the three cases quoted by C. in M'Clure,
presumably the strongest. In the first (Seance I. 11.44, M'Clure^
p. 670), it is obvious that there was a change of control when least
desirable. The quotation varies from the full S.P.R. report; but
according to either there was a change.
According to the S.P.K. report, the medium must haA'e removed
C.'s right hand from her knees at the critical moment ;
according to
the quotation she must have released her own right from F.
S.P.R. Report
I. " 11.44. Complete levitation of the table.
F. My hand was on the table. Medium's right hand on top of
mine and not touching the table.
C. . . . My right hand was across both her knees , . .
C. The medium's left hand grasped my right hand firmly and was
over mine, mine being between hers and the table."
The quotation in M'Clure reads :
" The medium's right hand
grasped my left hand firmly."
In the second instance quoted (Seance II., 11.1), the control of
the feet seems most unsatisfactory, for they were not even felt as
on the controllers' feet, but only as touching them (11.0). (In
M'Clwe there is, probably by mistake, " F. My right hand was
across both her knees," instead of the reading in the S.P.E. "My
left hand," etc. If this is not a mistake there was an important
change of control between 11.0 and 11.1. See the full report.)
In the third instance (IX. 10.2-3), when F. was on the floor
holding both Eusapia's ankles, her two hands appear to have been
236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.
in contact with the table all the time, see 10.17, 10.20, and the
note of F. to 10.17.
According to p. 332 of the Report the maximum levitation of
the table lasted "two or three seconds," and there is a valuable
note of F.'s to Seance V., 12.6 (p. 43G). The shorthand report
states that Eusapia's hands were "just touching the rim" of the
table when it went up. F. adds (the next day): "The table had
tilted over a long way ... It then made a sudden jump with all
four legs oft' the ground. Experiment shows that if her knees were
against both legs, a strong pull with both hands on the rim could
produce this effect."
It may be added that the table is both small and light (p. 345),
-and that Eusapia is an exceedingly powerful woman.^
Objects emerging from the caliinet, pp. 337-339 (12), (13), (14).
Might not the " white hands " and " black heads " be produced by
Eusapia's own hand, either bare, or wraj^ped in her handkerchief,
or in the curtain The Committee themselves call attention to
the suspicious appearance of some of the " black heads " (p. 338,
483), and Mrs. H.'s description of one is very significant (Seance XL,
11.34):—
" The black object was decidedly covered with the curtain (not
black muslin). It (the curtain) came out on my side close to me,
and it was tightly stretched over the object in which I distinguished
the same elongated hand seen at 10.54 p.m. The fingers seemed to
imitate a profile like an omhre chinoise, the middle finger crooked
like a Roman nose, the folded thumb forming a chin. This is a
manifestation which has never failed to appear at any of Eusapia's
stances at which I have been present."
It is noteworthy that this manifestation appeared to F. " like a
large black head with clearly marked features more than life size,
as though made of stiff black muslin "
(p. 546).

If Eusapia once got her left hand free, could she not have thrust
it into the cabinet, taken the board, and pushed it out between the

left curtain and the window, over R.'s shoulder, where in fact it
appeared ?
The chief objection that C. brings against this idea (p. 503) is
that he himself, standing at the opposite side of the table, and on
the medium's right, would have seen the curtain moved by her left
arm, and he did not see it. But,
(«) Skilful handling would have reduced the movement of the
curtain to a minimum.
(6) It seems as though it must have been very hard to detect a
slight movement of the black curtain in that dim light (Light III.),
and from the angle where he was standing (see plan, p. 503).
(c) Were not his eyes fixed on the passage of the clay outside the
curtain at the time 1
That Eusapia really could have got her left hand free is strongly
suggested by the shorthand report. The four hands—her two, one
of R.'s and one of F.'s—were at first all together on the table
one curtain was right over the table (11.55), and one at least of <
her hands was moving about. ("12.22. li. Her left hand was
stroking my wrist.") Is it not quite possible that what R. thought
was her left hand was part of her right 1
The cold breeze and the curtain bulging, etc., p. 340 (18), p. 332 (2).
C. (Note to Seance VI., p. 457) states "it is almost impossible
to conceive the elaborate apparatus that would be necessary to
produce all the effects observed by us." But the out.sider has to
judge by the written record, and is forced to press the question
whether that evidence necessitates for the remaining phenomena
anything more elaborate than the following
(1) A dummy hand which could be made collapsible, and slipped
between Eusapia's skin and her combinations, or between her stays
and her shift.
(2) A short indiarubber tube with a bulb at one end, and pos-
sibly wired at the other. If this were hidden in her hair, she
might, one ventures to suggest, produce the famous " breeze " from
the scar under her tresses, by squeezing the bulb either with her
hand or against the back of her chair (pp. 340, 421, 458,
Seances V. and VI.). This breeze is generally known as "the
cold breeze," and C. in M'Clure says, " when tested by a thermometer
it has caused a fall of 3 or 4 degrees "
(p. 669). But in the S.P.R.
report the Committee note (p. 458) that " a thermometer, held to
her head, failed to record any lowering of the temperature." The
238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.
experiments referred to in APChire cannot, therefore, be taken as
conclusive. At the end of the same article C. gives an account of
the remarkable effects he could produce with a similar tube. The
appearance of innocent astonishment on Eusapia's part when he
showed her his skill is exactly what we might expect on the
hypothesis that she is a cunning trickster, and used a tool of the
same kind herself.
Since the above was written. Miss Johnson has told me that a
similar suggestion had been made to her independently by Mr. W.
S. Davis,! Secretary of the Metropolitan Psychical Society in New
York. He writes (New York Times, Oct. 17, 1909) that this effect
can be produced by the bulb being "concealed under the dress close
to the armpit, while the hose runs up the back under the dress,
thence into the hair to the temple." Of course Eusapia could hide
the tube at some seances in one place, and at others in another.
(3) A thin bladder made to fit the mouth-end of the same tube,
and such that it could either be left to lie flat, or inflated by
squeezing the bulb (or possibly a second tube, with bulb and bladder
complete). There appear to be many possible modifications of this
device, from the ordinarj' "Mysterious Plate-Lifter" (which can be
got at a conjurer's shop), to more elaborate kinds, e.g. those used
for spraying scent, which have an arrangement of valves allowing
fresh air to be drawn in through the bulb. By some such means
a thin bladder could be dilated to a considerable size, while, when
not distended, it could easily be tucked away. The descriptions of
the dress-swelling and curtain-bulging - seem exactly to suit the
effect that might be produced by such a bladder, dilated at will.
The curtain is stated to " balloon out in a round bulge " as though
pushed out from behind. "If we made a sudden grab at the bulge,
no resistance was encountered, and the bulge subsided as though
1 Mr. Davis has for many years made a study of the methods used by
fraudulent mediums, and is himself an adept in reproducing them. See an
article by Dr. Hodgson in Proceedings S. P.R. , Vol. VIII. pp. 295-6, and
302-7.
-Mr. Davis, writing to Miss Johnson later (January 2nd, 1910), suggests
that "the blowing out of the curtains may be explained by the use of a very
thin rubber hose, about the thickness of a lead pencil, and painted black so
as to be invisible, which is attached to a bulb, or possibly a small steel flask
containing compressed air, under considerable pressure. The curtains are very
thin, and it wouldn't take much air in motion to move them. It would be
exceedingly difficult to detect this sort of trickery, for if the curtains were
suddenly parted nothing would be noticeable."
Feb., 1910. The Nci'ples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 239
one had pricked the surface of a balloon " (p. 333). The usual
position observed for the bulge, not far from Eusapia's head, and
"about 4 ft. from the floor" (pp. 380, 381) would appear to
coincide with the position required if the tube came from her back
hair and was slipped through the opening of the curtains.
If the bladder were made detachable, it seems probable that the
curtain-bulging might have been produced by the same tube
employed afterwards for the breeze. For it is noticeable that this
latter phenomenon occurred at the dose of the seances when Eusapia
had no further use for the bladder.
The dummy hand and the tubes and bladder (possibly only one
tube) appear to be all that she needed during Seance V. (when
she offered to be searched) or during Seances VI. and VIII., the
onl}' two seances at which a search was made. And on neither
occasion was it possible to make the search complete. For even at
the ladies' examination (p. 505) Eusapia was not entirely undressed,
nor was her hair undone. She remained clothed in "a pair of
grey, woolly, divided combinations ; that is to say, body and
drawers." A good deal could be hidden there. Moreover, she was
allowed to undress herself: so that she had abundant opportunity as
she took off each of her numerous outer wrappings for slipping
anything from one layer to the next beneath it.
For certain of the other seances she may have needed two other
appliances, but,- so far as I can see, only two, and those of a simple
character, viz. :
(4) A thin, dark, wire rod, about the thickness of a hairpin,
hooked at one end, so that it could pull or push a light object
such as the little table or the milking-stool (Seances II., IX., and
XL, i.e. the seance before the third member of the Committee arrived,
and the seances after the searchings were over).
(5) Some phosphorus for the two Seances VII. and XL, when the
lights were produced, p. 339 (17).
At Seance VII. (11.36-11.46) the lights appear cfter the medium
" puts her head behind the curtain and makes a sudden dive to
the right": at Seance XL (10.55-11.1) after "the left curtain came
right over the table" (10.54) and Mrs. H. had observed "an
elongated hand " over which " the curtain was tightly stretched."
It is true that for Seance VII. (11.46) we find the note "There
are no indications of the smell of phosphorus." But we have
evidence from the able report on Carancini by Mr. Baggally (B.)
that the absence of the smell is no proof that phosphorus was not
240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., l9io.
used. See Journal S.P.R., Jan. 1910, p. 199. During Seance V.,
when the lights appeared, we have this entry :
" Mr. Scott and
Mr. Baggally Avent into the cabinet immediately afterwards and did
not perceive any smell of phosphorus." But at the close of the
seance B. searched Carancini (p. 203), and " found in his pocket
a box of safety matches, and amongst them a few phosphorus
matches." One of these he dexterously abstracted and produced
with it " lights which were in all appearances identical with those
that had been seen at the seance."
Dress-swelling, p. 333 (3).
The best example of this was at the beginning of Seance VII. in
the brightest light, " the only seance at which we had an oppor-
tunity of careful observation of it " (p. 334). If Eusapia had the
india-rubber tube on this occasion tied round her waist by a string,
might she not, when she sat down, have arranged it through her
placket-hole so that the bulb was between the back of her chair
and her thigh, while the bladder lay among her petticoats ? Then
might not a slight pressure with her thigh have done the rest ?
When she prepares to lift her dress and petticoats for inspection,
she could hitch up the tube and sit on it, and she would, in the
hands of English gentlemen, be quite safe from detection.
Movements of tlie little table, p. 335 (8).
Most of these can be explained on the quite possible supposition
that Eusapia got one hand or foot free, but there remains one case
where this seems unlikely, viz. Seance II., 11.55 S., when it retired
from her in " a series of little jumps." Now, is it impossible for her
to have produced these motions undetected, by means of a wire
rod on the floor ? The movements were continued in Light I., but
they began in Light IV., venj dim, and were preceded hy a request
that her feet should be untied, which would constitute a serious
diversion. Tliat the phenomenon should take place in the best
light cuts against the argument that darkness is really bad for the
supernormal force. On the other hand, that it should be jrreceded
by a period of great dimness strongly suggests trickery, for the
moment of arranging the connection between herself and the table
would be the moment most dangerous for discovery. C. (p. 371)
saw that "there was no contact between the medium's foot and the
table," but apparently he did not feel along the floor between it
and her to discover if there was any other connection. Nor can he
Feb., ]91o. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 241
be blamed for not doing so, since he would have had to lose control
of her for the time (only F. and C. being present at this seance).
This illustrates—what is frequently illustrated throughout—the fact
that under the conditions imposed by the medium the controllers
must often be as much hampered by her as she by them.
Twanging of the guitar, p. 335 (7).
First Case. Seance II., about 12.3. Is it out of the question for
her to have plucked the string with the hooked wire already used
for the little table? (See the last paragraph on II., 11.55.) C. says,
p. 373, that her feet were controlled, but on p. 372 we find (as noted
by himself and F.) that "the foot-control is omitted" in the report.
It is true they add " owing to the excellence of the light, however,
we could clearly see that her feet were not employed." But,
(1) The light, though their best, could not be called brilliant,
for it was shaded and contrasted (p. 361 fin.) with the "bright
light " in the next room.
(2) Eusapia's "knees and feet were towards the seance table," and
therefore, presumably, in its shadow, or even under it.
(3) Both F. and C. were looking attentively into the dark cabinet
behind her (p. 371 fin.), and therefore it is hard to understand how
they could see what she was doing with her feet at the critical
time.
There was a good opportunity for her to secrete the rod imme-
diately afterwards, for we read (p. 372, just before 12.5):
"F. The medium says that she wants to touch the small table
in the cabinet. She raises it from the floor and puts it upside
down and closes the curtains."
Second Case. Seance VI. (p. 457. Note by C.)
This occurred
(1) After the shorthand report ends.
(2) When they thought the seance was over, and therefore could
not have been controlling her so carefulh\
(3) When B. and M. were talking.
(4) When Eusapia might have imitated the slight sound of the
twanging that they heard. That she does imitate sounds is the almost
inevitable inference from the "kiss" episode, see Seance VII., 12 p.m.
Movements of the curtains, p. 332 (2).
The tmJging has already been discussed, and it is not suggested
that anything else was produced by the device of the bladder.
But the other movements seem susceptible of other explanations.
242 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., i9io.
For instance, she might have pulled the curtain with her own
hand, as B. actually cauglit her doing with the very hand that
F. was controlling at the time (Seance VIII., 12.43, Note by B.).
Or she might whisk it out with the help of the rod on the floor,
a method suggested by the account of the curtain movements at
the beginning of Seance XL, considered by F. to be the most
evidential he had seen. These occurred in the best light ; and
at 10.11, F., seated on the medium's right, had made a clear
space of about 12 in. between her foot and the right curtain. But
since then ;
—
(1) There had been some moments of less light (10.18).
(2) Eusapia had made a request for the little stool, which would
cause some diversion.
(3) The only control mentioned for hands or feet is that F. held
one of her hands, and that one foot, presumably her right, was
on his.
(4) Her dress had bulged out towards the curtain between her
chair and F.
It seems possible, therefore, that she might have got the wire rod
laid aslant on the floor, at her other side, where F. could not see
it, one end being under her left foot, and the other slipped in
through the opening behind the edge of the right curtain. A jerk
with her left foot might then have produced the effect he observed,
when "the whole of the left edge of the right curtain rushed out
and completely enveloped her right side."
Movements of the little stool, p. 339 (16).
I take the strongest cases.
. (a) Seance IX., after 11.45 (pp. 514 ff.) when it moved along
the floor, in a poorish light, (the second Light II. = the original
Light IIL)i
Here, again, we must ask what security we have that there was
no connection between the medium and the stool when it was
moving 1 "Examination for an attachment of some kind was made
in the intervals between movements of this kind " (p. 339). But that
is not enouah ; since it is conceivable that Eusapia could jerk the
connection away when she saw the investigator preparing to examine.
The examination by M., the stenographer, was made (p. 514)
iThis light is called "very good" ad loc, but see pp. 419, 355. In the first
Light II., which ivas brighter, the room was so dark that the reflection on a
patent leather shoe looked like a mysterious light on the floor, (p. 355.)
Feb., 1910. The Nafples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 243
when the stool " had finished." M. was sitting at another table
(plan, p. 508), and had to leave his place for the purpose. And
no doubt Eusapia would say that any interposition during the
movements would impede " her fluid." According to the Eeport,
it was only M. who examined the stool at this Seance, and in this
inconclusive fashion (cp. also XL, 10.23). There were previous motions
of the little stool outside the cabinet, IX. 10.30-10.40, but in a still
poorer light, (Light IIL), and this when the foot control was
obviously weak, (see B. 10.30 and C. 10.33), and when C. notes
the day after, " I was dissatisfied at the time with the sensation of
the hand control (10. 34)." On the other hand, at the beginning
of Seance VIL, when the conditions were more exacting, when the
light had not yet been lowered, and when F. could report, "I have
felt several times between her and the stool right along the
floor, . . . and since I have passed my hand between her and the
stool she has not touched the curtain in any way," then we find
that nothing happened, except the bulging of her dress." " TAe stool
did not move. F. December 8th, 1908." Later on (VIL, 10.30) the
stool did move, but meanwhile there had been a " relaxation of
control " when " the seance table was being turned round," and
the stool was now invisible '•
under the curtains " (F. 10.33).
(5) Seance XL, 12.26, when the stool climbed up the curtain.
The control here is not given in full, (see 11.49, p. 548), so
that the whole episode might be dismissed as non-evidential. But,
taking the report as it stands, there appears a strong presumption
that the stool was hoisted by Eusapia's left hand, working inside
the curtain at the point where the stool touched it. I should
judge from experiments I have made that this would be quite a
possible feat, if part of the bottom of the curtain were held taut
at a certain angle. Now it is very rash to suppose that Eusapia
could not have got at least one hand and foot free, because :
(1) Only Z. (her friend) and Mrs. H. were controlling her at the
time.
(2) The curtain had just been over the table (12.15).
(3) The hght was very dim (Light IV. shaded), so dim that M.,
standing between the medium and Mrs. H., had to feel their arms
and hands to make sure of their position. When M. felt the medium's
left hand later it was too late to be conclusive, because by that time
the stool must have been over Mrs. H.'s shoulder. Even so, Eusapia
was evidently annoyed at M.'s attempt.
(4) No foot control is mentioned at all after 11.49.
244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.
M. felt on either side of the stool as it was climbing up, " hut
not between the stool and the curtain, as I ivas afraid of interfering with
the movements," (which no doubt he would have done). He then
adds, " there was nothing tangible behind it." But as it was too
dark for him to see, and as he would not feel, it is not easy for
an outsider to accept this inference.
The touches on B.'s hade outside (Jie curtain, p. .3.36 (10).
Seance X., 12.11-12.20, and Notes by F. and B., pp. 533 535.
These touches occurred in the total darkness, a darkness that corre-
sponded suspiciously with the presence of a photographer. At 12.11
F. caught Eusapia's hands in the " substitution position." F., in the
kindness of his heart, is inclined to attribute this to "weariness or
carelessness " on her part, because she showed him " the position of
her left hand, which was under B.'s right. B. stated that it had
been there all the time." But the last time B. stated his control
(11.42), her left hand was in his left, and his rigid was on the back
of her neck. Even if there was no substitution, might not the
touches have been produced by the wire hooked on to some part of
Eusapia's person ' '"
The touches on B. during Seance XL, 12.51 and later (pp. 552, 564.
See also (11), p. 337).
Now, (1) These occurred after the control was no longer to be
given in full (11.49).
(2) The light—(No. IV. shaded)—from 10.58 onwards was so dim
that F. when sitting next to the medium could not see the individual
fingers of her hands.
B. thought he could see both hands at 12.51, but he was not
touching both, and in that dimness would it be possible to distinguish
hy sight alone a dummy hand from a real one?
(3) B. did not hold both Eusapia's hands until after 12.56, when the
curtain was blown over the table. Then he only held her thumbs, so

EEPOKT OF THE COUNCIL FOE THE YEAE 1909.
The membership of the Society has, as usual, continued to
increase during the year. 27 new Members (including one
Corresponding Member) were elected and 3 Associates became
Members; 128 new Associates were elected and 4 Members
became Associates. On the other hand, the total loss in
numbers from deaths,^ resignations, and other causes was 20
Members and 102 Associates, leaving a net increase of 40.
The total membership has now reached 1230, the numbers
being distributed as follows: Members, 300 (including 25
Honorary and Corresponding Members); Associates, 930 (in-
cluding 12 Honorary Associates).
A general increase in activity has also been evinced by the
fact that three Parts of Proceedings have been published this
year, in February, June and November, amounting to 782 pp.,
whereas last year (1908) only two Parts appeared, in June
and October, amounting to 686 pp., and the year before (1907)
two Parts, in February and October, amounting to 318 pp.
The papers published this year included two reports on the
trance phenomena of Mrs. Piper ; the first by Professor James,
chiefly relating to the sittings in America that took place
shortly after Dr. Hodgson's death (that is, during the first half
of 1906) in which a number of communications purported to
come from him. The second report by Sir Oliver Lodge dealt
with his sittings with Mrs. Piper in England at the end of
1906, and the spring of 1907, the intermediate period having
been already dealt with by Mr. Piddington in his report in
Proceedings, Vol. XXII.
Since Mrs. Piper's return to America, a series of sittings
with her on behalf of the S.P.E. has been held by one of our
Vice-Presidents, Mr. G. B. Dorr. Some of the results of these
sittings were reported by Mr. Piddington at a meeting of the
Society in October, and several papers on them will be
published in the forthcoming part of Proceedings.
Meanwhile Miss Verrall has been working over the volumi-
nous unpublished records of earlier Piper sittings held by Dr.
^ It happens that we have lost an unusually large number throuf;h death
this year, viz., 6 Members and 19 Associates, total 25; whereas last year the
total number of losses from this cause was 14, which was larger than usual.

Hodgson in America, which were sent over to England after his
death, and a paper on these is now nearly ready for publication.
Mrs. Verrall and the other automatic writers, between whom
and Mrs. Piper so many " cross-correspondences " have occurred,
have been continuing their script, with results which will be
reported to the Society from time to time. As stated by
Mrs. Verrall at a meeting of tlie Society in May, some cross-
correspondences also occurred between Miss Verrall's and her
scripts, and those of a new group of automatic writers hitherto
unknown to any of the others. Mrs. Verrall's paper on this
case will be included in the forthcoming part of Proceedings.
Part LIX. contained the full report of the Naples sittings
with Eusapia Palladino, of which Mr. Feilding gave a summary
at the meeting of the Society in June. Some criticisms of
this report have since appeared in the Journal and the discus-
sion is to be continued.
In July and August some sittings were held with the
Italian medium, Carancini, who was alleged to produce " physical
phenomena " of the same general type as those which are said
to occur with Eusapia. The results of these sittings, however,
were disappointing ; not only because they presented no evidence
of any genuine phenomena, but also because there was definite
positive evidence of fraud on the medium's part. Mr. Baggally,
who was in charge of the sittings, gave an account of them
at the last meeting of the Society, and his account is printed
in the Journal for January, 1910.
During the year a legacy of £100 was left to the Society
by the late Mr. Eobert Hannah, who died on April 5th, 1909.
Mr. Hannah had been a member for many years and was
deeply interested in the work, to which he had generously
contributed for several years an extra annual subscription.
There are a few points in the balance sheet for the year
which may be noted. On the one side we have—in accordance
with the increase in membership of the Society—an increased
income from annual subscriptions, which amounted this year
to about £88 more than last year. It is also gratifying to
observe that the sale of our publications to persons not belong-
ing to the Society brought in nearly three times as much
this year as last, viz., £128 instead of £44. This seems to
indicate a general growth in the interest taken by the public
Mae., 1910. Report of the Council. 253
in our work. On the other hand, corresponding to an increased
output of publications, our expenses for printing and postage
have increased, being £181 more this year than last. There is
a prospect that this item will continue to grow as time goes
on, and while it should be possible always to meet the
printing expenses from the annual income from subscriptions,
the research work, which leads to the greater part of these
expenses, will also, it is to be hoped, constantly increase, and
research in some cases involves other expenses. The Council
desire, therefore, to remind members that the Endowment
Eesearch Fund has not yet reached the £8000 which they
fixed as its first goal, and that further contributions to it
will be gratefully received.
Two General and four Private Meetings of the Society (for
Members and Associates only) were held during the year. The
dates and subjects of the papers read were as follows
*January 28th. "Preliminary Report on Mrs. Piper's
Hodgson Control," by Professor William James.
March 30th. "Some Incidents in the Script of Mrs.
Holland," by Miss Alice Johnson.
May 18th. "A New Group of Automatic Writers,"
by Mrs. A. W. Verrall.
*June 18th. "A Series of Sittings with Eusapia Palla-
dino," by The Hon. Everard Feilding.
October 28th. "Classical Allusions in Mrs. Piper's Trance,"
by Mr. J. G. Piddington.

Dowsers," by Professor W. F. Barrett, F.Pi.S. " Some
Sittings with Carancini," by Mr. W. W. Baggally.
THE EDUCATION OF AN OBSERVEE.
By Sir Oliver Lodge.
A NOTABLE paper by Miss Johnson appeared in the Proceed-
ings, Vol. XXL, under the title " The Education of the Sitter,"
a head under which she usefully criticises certain records of
observations of physical phenomena ;
regarding them—either
naturally or artificially, that is to say either in her own proper
* Those marked with an asterisk were General Meetings.
254 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae., 1910.
person or as a useful exercise—from the point of view of
the extreme sceptic. I have nothing to find fault with in
the paper ; it is well adapted to its purpose, which I presume
is to urge whatever can be urged against the accounts which
have been given hitherto of the observation of supposed super-
normal physical phenomena, so as to assist future records to
be of a more complete and more obviously trustworthy
character.
But there are two points on which I think her article
needs supplementing, since without some supplement it may
be misleading.
One is that she appears to think an observer worse instead
of better for continual opportunity for observation, because he
is liable to become sophisticated by habit ; whereas her real
meaning doubtless is that this only applies to observers who
are insufficiently critical and too easily convinced ; inasmuch
as they are liable to observe less and less well as they go on,
so that their accounts become less and less reliable.
The other point is that she seems hardly to discriminate
sufficiently between the reports of a skilled practitioner and a
novice—meaning by a novice not a novice in everything, but
a novice in the art of making and learning from experiment.
The most learned moral philosopher—the most astute man
of letters—may be a novice if immersed in the intricacies
of a laboratory. If he is wise he will keep his hands in
his pockets and not attempt to meddle. It used to be amusing
to see an examination candidate sometimes automatically assume
this attitude in a junior practical examination. It was a sure
sign that he had learnt from text-books and blackboard draw-
ings ; he might answer questions on paper fairly well, but of
instruments themselves he had a marked and well-grounded
mistrust. An experienced experimentalist is not in this
predicament, since he is accustomed to manipulate and deal
critically with phenomena and to draw deductions from them.
Miss Johnson's reply to this will doubtless be that even
scientific experimentalists are novices when they enter the
region of psychical research, and must be treated as such
until they have had experience in this particularly treacherous
field. Their special aptitude and skill will make them quick
to realise features of importance, but will not guard them
Mai?., 1910. The Education of an Observer. 255
against deception. For this kind of investigation it is indeed
often urged that an expert must be an expert oA hoc, and
that general scientific training is not sufficient ;
—that the
training of a conjurer is better.
I do not wish to contest that position,—both kinds of training
are certainly useful ; but I do feel that a man of science has
an undeniable advantage over—let us say—a man of letters
or a philosopher, in the particular matter of learning by direct
observational experience, whatever other comparative disadvan-
tages may fall to his lot. And if he cares to devote his
energies to psychical research for a moderate time he ought
before long to become an expert in that field also.
However I do not propose either to discuss or criticise Miss
Johnson's paper in detail—1 only propose to supplement it
and I can do so most readily and compactly by making a
short and independent communication of my own. And in
so doing I would explain that I have in my mind her few
remarks on the testimony of Sir William Crookes, rather than
her criticism of observations made by Lord Adare. The latter
gentleman is not known to me, but I presume that he would
not claim to be an observer with the training of a man of
science.
The title Miss Johnson uses for her paper will serve my
turn—only slightly modified so as to make it more general
and not applicable to psycho-physical investigators alone.
It must be admitted that however great the intellectual
competence of a man of letters may be, he is not accustomed
to the examination and discovery of truth by means of physical
experiments. A training in this special kind of observation is
surely necessary for the formation of a valid and secure opinion,
in addition to the natural powers of an educated mind. Take
such a person into an ordinary physical laboratory for instance,
and show him an experiment of any delicacy ; it is quite
possible that he will see nothing at all. He certainly will
not be able to interpret what he sees without guidance, and
it will not be difficult to guide him wron" Knowing this,
he will mistrust his own judgment,—he will not think of
expressing a first-hand opinion; and if—to suppose something.
256 Journal of Society for PsycJdcal Research. Mae., l9io.
absurd—he is asked to report on the phenomena in a respon-
sible manner, he will necessarily be ultra-sceptical and hard
to convince of anything whatever. Amid so many loop-holes
for error, under such strange surroundings, the circumstances
will necessarily call out a degree of caution which cannot be
stigmatised as excessive. In some instances even the trained
physicist will have lost his bearings and feel on strange
ground. In that case he too will, if he is wise, be extremely
cautious. But when he is on familiar territory, he knows fairly
well what to look for, and is ready to draw inferences, with
caution indeed but without excessive compunction. Every
man of science makes inferences which to men trained in
other branches—even in other sciences—will seem to be rapid
induction based upon instinct rather than upon complete
evidence. The facts which led Dalton to the atomic theory,
for instance, would not have led the ordinarily educated man
anywhere. Ordinary men live surrounded by phenomena of
which the scientific meaning and theory is quite unknown to
them. The very same facts, to the trained intelligence specially
directed to them for months or years, may be full of signi-
ficance. No stigma—nothing odious—is conveyed by such a
comparison. The score of a symphony is one thing to a
skilled musician ; it is another thing and nearly meaningless
to a man in the street.
Even a practised observer like Faraday, a man who lived
in a laboratory all his life and worked constantly with his
own hands—even Faraday when taken to a new experiment
asked to be told " what he had to see " before sitting down
to it ; and he never considered himself capable of seriously
criticising an observation until he had himself witnessed the
experiment which demonstrated it. He knew well what a
multitude of things might confuse the observer ;
he knew how
difficult it is to see a phenomenon for the first time,—how
comparatively easy the repetition becomes. Instruction from
the man who was familiar with the particular experiment,
and a hint as to what the precise point was that constituted
the novelty, was sought—even by him.
How then can it be supposed that an observer or sitter can
dispense with education ? How can it be thought that his
first and unaided impressions are likely to be the best ?
JlAK., 1910. The Education of an Observer. 257
If it be urged that every one is a novice in a strange field
for some time after he has entered it, I agree. Great and
patient care must be taken not to be hasty either in coming
to a conclusion or in publishing results ;
acceptance on the
part of a novice might easily be detrimental, and vi^ould not
really substantiate the phenomenon to which he prematurely
testifies. But still the converse remains true, that the novice
in every kind of physical science feels himself at a still
greater disadvantage ;
and, if wise, he is instinctively cautious,
self-distrustful and sceptical. To learn direct from phenomena
is not a common attitude of mind : the usual method is to
learn from books and from people. The exploration of nature
at first hand is not a matter to be lightly and confidently
undertaken ; and a person who had dealt chiefly with books
would find it necessary to be ultra-sceptical, in order not to
be credulous, when called upon to deal with things. Here I
think lies the explanation of some of the hyper-scepticism now
prevalent concerning what are called " physical phenomena,"
whose basis is necessarily that of direct experimental observa-
tion. They are facts extremely difficult to admit into any
scheme of nature, since they seem to run counter to life-long
experience. They are indeed so extraordinary as to be repellent.
They cannot, I should judge, be legitimately accepted on second
hand testimony. No testimony seems able to sustain them
it can but establish a lyrima facie case for an open mind.
Nevertheless, both by physicists and physiologists, they have
had to be admitted as true, as a result of direct and repeated
experience ; and sooner or later their place in the scheme of
things must be found.
Meanwhile it will remain difficult to demonstrate them.
The object of showing experiments to a learner is to
illustrate something which is being verbally explained—to
make the fact more real and living. Sometimes a diagram
does better, and always the experiment must be simplified as
much as possible. He must to a certain extent take things
on trust—at least he cannot be supposed to be a competent
critic, and if unable to see some faint result when it occurs,
his failure proves nothing concerning it either way. Even if
he does see it, or imagine that he sees it, he will find himself
not permanently proof against the suggestion—sometimes quite
258 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1910.
absurd, but sometimes not unjustified—of anticipatory hallucina-
tion. Novices brought in to see the efi'ect of imaginary
N-rays sometimes saw them. Skilled physicists from this
country did not. The evidence of the novice—however good
it may really be—is bound to be mistrusted even by himself.
Call upon a spectator at a conversazione to inspect a
photograph of a spectrum which demonstrates, say, the magnetism
of a sun-spot,—and he will see nothing but a smear crossed
by rather fuzzy streaks. The fuzziness is the essence of the
phenomenon. How can he possibly form an opinion on what
he sees ? No one expects him to. He would feel bound to
take an agnostic attitude.
This is probably the reason why even orthodox scientific results
are only half accepted by the public, until they have become
a matter of habit. If anything depends upon acceptance by
the public, that body is bound to be sceptical : it can -only
take new things on authority. We all take things to some
extent on authority, except in the special and narrow field
which we have ourselves investigated after a lifetime of training.
Everybody has his own field, and outside that he is content
to learn from others,—subject always to his ordinary common
sense, which enables him to judge and more or less clearly
discriminate between authorities, if they confiict.
Concerning this very matter of supernormal physical phenomena
there is decided conflict, and it is to the ordinarily trained
educated man that appeal must be made.
If after due consideration people in general decide against
the reality of modern miracles—as they have been called—
shall be entirely content. If the time is not ripe for their
reception it is better that they be rejected for a season. Far
better things than they have had to run the gauntlet of hostile
criticism and to bide their time.
All I would suggest is that meanwhile wise and responsible
persons—whatever their training may have been—should not
too strenuously or too assiduously deny the possibility of the
occurrence of everything that has at one time or another been
styled miraculous. Some day we may have to discriminate,
and to admit that some of them—some few of them—may
have really happened.
Mar., I'JIO. The Education of an Observer. 259
Note on the above Paper.
With Sir Oliver Lodge's permission I add a few words to his
paper in the same number of the Journal, —not with a view to
combatting his general conclusions, with which I heartily concur,
but in my turn to supplement them, and also to make my own
position clearer.
The title of my paper was, perhaps, unfortunate, as it lends itself
to his interpretation that an observer becomes worse instead of better
for continual observation. This no doubt happens sometimes with
very uncritical and careless observers ; but in speaking of the
"Education" of the sitter, I was referring to the gradual develop-
ment in him of susceptibility to suggestion, —either from the general
environment or from the medium,—and I think that no one who
has had much practical experience of sittings can doubt that such
a development is often liable to occur.
Sir Oliver Lodge shows clearly the necessity for practical training
in observation before a man can become an expert observer, and
remarks that even Faraday did not think himself capable of judging
a physical experiment the first time he saw it. Still less, I suppose,
would he have felt capable of judging a biological experiment,
and following out the same principle, he should have felt less
capable still of judging an experiment in psychical research.
And, as an intelligent man distrusts his own judgment of a subject
which is new to him, so he expects that any one who claims to
be listened to on any subject must first have studied it thoroughly.
Thus, if a supposed discovery is made in chemistry, its acceptance by
the scientific world does not depend on whether the discoverer is,
say, an expert astronomer, but on whether he is a competent chemist.
But if a supposed discovery is made in psychical research, it is almost
invariably recommended to the world on the groimd that the dis-
coverer is an eminent physiologist, or a distinguished psychologist,
or astronomer, or physicist, whereas it appears to me that the only
relevant consideration is his competence as a psychical researcher.
By a competent psychical researcher I do not mean, as Sir Oliver
Lodge suggests, a conjurer. A professional conjurer is generally a
man of limited education, whose limitations are apt to make him
dogmatic in some cases and credulous in others, and it is notorious
that professional conjurers have been deceived by fraudulent mediums,
though they have also done good occasional service in exposing
frauds. While a conjurer is on safe ground in dealing with fraud,
260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae., 1910.
since the art of deception is his special province, he is on the same level
with any other amateur as far as genuine phenomena are concerned.
Therefore, while his evidence is valuable when he can show how
a given performance is done, the mere fact that he cannot see how
it is done proves nothing, except that the capacity of the performer
—whether fraudulent m' genuine—exceeds his own.
Nevertheless, since, of course, fraud is a large element in what
we have to deal with, an expert in fraud is one—though by no
means the only one—of the experts needed in our work. I think,
however, that a man of general education who has added a practical
knowledge of conjuring to his general equipment (as was pre-
eminently the case, e.g. with Dr. Hodgson), is likely to be much
more useful than a mere conjurer.
With the greatest possible respect for science, I do not regard it
as the one and only study in which a scientific habit of mind can
be cultivated. An equally high standard of accuracy, a power of
nice discrimination, and a capacity for judging evidence, may be
found among men of letters. And even a philosopher may be useful
in expounding the general principles on which enquiries should be
carried on, and the conclusions which may legitimately be deduced
from them. In our work, the help of educated men of every type
is of great advantage, and we liave been fortunate in never being
without it. But we have been fortunate above all in being able
to count among our founders—to speak only of those who are
no longer living—men who were not only eminent in philosophy,
or in letters, or versed in practical science, but each one of whom
was at the same time an expert in psychical research.

Concluding Note.
There is nothing in this Note of Miss Johnson's with which I
disagree, unless it be the emphasis laid on "suggestibility" in con-
nexion with skilled and responsible observers ; and in her concluding
paragraph—as is clear from page 4 of my book " The Survival of
Man"—I heartily concur.

PEIVATE MEETING FOE MEMBEES AND ASSOCIATES.
The 31st Private Meeting of the Society for Members and
Associates only was held in the large Hall at 20 Hanover
Square, London, W., on Tuesday, March 15th, 1910, at 4 p.m.;
the Peesident, Mr. H. Arthur Smith, in the chair.
Dr. T. W. Mitchell read a paper on " A Study in Hysteria
and Double Personality, with Eeport of a Case," which will, it
is hoped, be published later in the Proceedings. The following
is a short abstract of the case reported
In 1901 Amelia G. P., aged 29, developed a variety of
hysterical symptoms after a period of acute illness which corre-
sponded to no known affection. She presented many of the
recognised stigmata of hysteria, such as hemianaesthesia, con-
centric reduction of the visual fields, paralysis and tremor of
the limbs. She also suffered for over a year from an unusual
form of speech-defect, which was accompanied by word-blindness.
The power of writing was retained, but her spelling reproduced
264 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apkil, 1910.
all the peculiarities of her speech. This illness lasted for
eighteen months, after which she remained well until the end
of 1904, when she again became affected in a similar way.
All the old symptoms returned in a more severe form, and
many new ones developed. On this occasion her illness lasted
until the end of December, 1905. From this date she kept
well until ISTovember, 1908, when she had a recurrence of the
same kind of illness.
From the beginning of this last attack she was treated by
hypnotic suggestion, and Dr. Mitchell said he was struck by
the unequal response to therapeutic suggestions which he met
with in this case. It seemed to him that the resistance
encountered in connection with particular suggestions was the
deliberate act of a second personality which was brought to
light by the induction of hypnosis. Only when the hypnotic
personality so pleased were suggestions for the relief of any
particular symptom of any avail.
Further evidence of the existence of a second personality was
found in the somnambulic life of the patient, and in her
tendency to drop into the second state spontaneously in the
daytime. For convenience the hypnotic state was referred to
as Amelia and the waking state as Milly—the name generally
used by the patient's friends. Amelia claimed to be different
in some ways from Milly. She said she knew more than
Milly did and remembered much that Milly had forgotten.
Amelia maintained that she was the originator of some of
Milly's hysterical symptoms. She said :
" I made her hands
shake and her legs as well, and I scratched her and made all
those nasty places on her hands and legs, and made her fingers
close down and her thumbs so that she could not move them.
. . . I made her fall downstairs and hurt herself." She denied
all responsibility, however, for the speech troubles and the other
more serious symptoms, and Dr. Mitchell was inclined to think
that there was some foundation for the distinction she made.
The more serious functional disorders appeared to him to be
connected with the functioning of dissociated states of conscious-
ness which were not synthesised within the hypnotic personality.
And although these symptoms were ultimately removed by
suggestion, their removal seemed to necessitate the induction of
DO '
a deeper hypnotic state.
Apeil, 1910. Euscipia Pallaclino in America. 265
During the discussion that followed, Dr. Agatha Porter
asked if there had been any evidence of double personality
before the patient was hypnotised.
Dr. Mitchell replied that he had had no reason to suspect
the existence of a second personality until after hypnosis had
been induced. But he did not think that the doubling of the
personality was a result of hypnosis. He said that in ordinary
hypnotic somnambules a second personality, perhaps as well
marked as that shown in the case recorded, might be artificially
created by suggestion, but in this case he had found the second
personality already formed when the hypnotic state was first
induced.
In reply to the Eev. J. W. Hayes, Dr. Mitchell said he
thought the amount of malice that such an artificially formed
personality could be made to display would depend on the real
character of the subject rather than on the intentions of the
hypnotist.
EUSAPIA PALLADINO IN AMEEICA.
A somewhat sensational article by Professor Hugo Miinsterberg
on the sittings with Eusapia Palladino in America has recently
appeared in The Metropolitan Magazine (for February, 1910).
Apart from one incident, to be related presently, on '
account
of which we refer to it, the article contains little or nothing
in the way of facts or of comments that will be new to those
who have paid any previous attention to the subject, while
Professor Miinsterberg disarms all criticism of himself as an
observer by remarking at the beginning, " I myself am entirely
unfit for such an investigation." He seems to decide, never-
theless, at the end that "physical phenomena" must be
impossible on a priori grounds, and between the two one
wonders tliat he took the trouble to sit with Eusapia at all.
With the fact that she is extremely skilful in making sub-
stitutions of one of her hands or feet for the other we are
already familiar; and we know that a number of devices
have been mentioned (in our pubhcations and elsewhere) by
which, in the opinion of many persons, some of her perfor-
mances may be carried out. Further, several cautious observers
have previously remarked that the occasional searches to which
266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, i9io.
she has submitted are not sufficient to exclude the possibility
of hidden apparatus.
There is, however, one observation of Professor Miinsterberg's
which seems novel and which, if confirmed and followed up
by other investigators, might be instructive. He says
I noticed, while I was sitting at her side, that every time before
a levitation of the table began she arranged something between her
knees under her clothes. It was often only a quick movement as if
she were pressing a button, but I never saw the levitation without
such a preparatory action, though the knees themselves, which I held
with my hand, were kept entirely quiet. Moreover, frequently she
arranged the folds of her skirt around the legs of the table as if
some forceps were to hold the table leg from below the gown.
The last part of the article also gives an account of a very
instructive and hitherto unpublished incident, as follows
One week before Christmas, at the midnight hour, I sat again at
Madame Palladino's favorite left side and a well-known scientist on
her right. We had her under strictest supervision. Her left hand
grasped my hand, her right hand was held by her right neighbor,
her left foot rested on my foot while her right was pressing the
foot of her other neighbor. For an hour the regulation performance
had gone on. But now we sat in the darkened room in the highest
expectancy while Mr. Carrington begged John to touch my arm and
then to lift the table in the cabinet behind her and John really
came. He touched me distinctly on my hip and then on my arm
and at last he pulled my sleeve at the elbow. I plainly felt the
thumb and the fingers. It was most uncanny. And, finally, John
was to lift the table in the cabinet. We held both her hands, we
felt both her feet, and yet the table three feet behind her began to
scratch the floor and we expected it to be lifted. But instead, there
suddenly came a wild, yelling scream. It was such a scream as I
have never heard before in my life, not even in Sarah Bernhardt's
most thrilling scenes. It was a scream as if a dagger had stabbed
Eusapia right through the heart.
What had happened 1 Neither she nor Mr. Carrington had the
slightest idea that a man was lying flat on the floor and had succeeded
in slipping noiselessly like a snail below the curtain into the cabinet.
I had told him that I expected wires stretched out from her body
and he looked out for them. What a surprise when he saw that
Apeil, 1910. Eusapia Palladino in America. 267
she had simply freed her foot from her shoe and with an athletic
backward movement of the leg was reaching out and fishing with
her toes for the guitar and the table in the cabinet ! And then
lying on the floor he grasped her foot and caught her heel with firm
hand, and she responded with that wild scream which indicated that
she knew that at last she was trapped and her glory shattered.
Her achievement was splendid. She had lifted her unshod foot
to the height of my arm when she touched me under cover of the
curtain, without changing in the least the position of her body.
When her foot played thumb and fingers the game was also neat
throughout. To be sure, I remember before she was to reach out
for the table behind her, she suddenly felt the need of touching my
left hand too, and for that purpose she leaned heavily over the table
at which we were sitting. She said that she must do it because
her spiritual fluid had become too strong and the touch would relieve
her. As a matter of course in leaning forward with the upper half
of her body she became able to push her foot further backward and
thus to reach the light table, which probably stood a few inches too
far. And then came the scream and the doom.
As our readers may like to have further authentic informa-
tion about this incident, what led up to it, and to whom the
credit of the exposure is due, we print the following account
by Mr. G-. B. Dorr of the sittings in question. The account
was undated, but bore the postmark Dec. 26th, 1909:
I had three seances with Eusapia Palladino in New York last
week. I arranged for them some time ago. And friends of mine
went to them with me, so that we could, to some extent, control
conditions. Professor Miinsterberg went with me also on two evenings,
the first and last. I had read the Naples report quite carefully,
and went, so far, prepared. The first evening Professor Miinster-
berg, I, and one of my friends controlled during the whole evening,
observing very closely, but—like others—came away quite unable to
explain the things that happened, which were mainly levitations of
the table, the over-throwing, or throwing out from the cabinet of the
little table placed in it, the blowing out of the curtain, and its
bulging out as though with pressure from behind, and toihchings on
the arm or side toward the cabinet, while my friend controlling
opposite me was grasped at one time on the arm. The light during
the levitations of the larger table was excellent, even strong, but
everything else happened in a dark-red light, diflficult to see in.
268 Journal of Society for Psychical ResearcJt. April, 1910.
A temporary boarding across the room, with a boarded-up recess in
it for cabinet, before which E. P. sat, made her background.
One could pass behind this boarding. I noticed one or two things
that seemed to ask attention that evening. One was that she com-
plained beyond what was reasonable, 1 thought, of pain caused by
my holding her hand even lightly, and by my resting my foot on
hers, so that she presently had both hand and foot resting upon
mine, and free.
Another thing was that the first thing that happened when any-
thing was about to take place in the cabinet was the blowing out
(as it seemed) of the curtain, which then remained resting on, and
covering, one or other of her arms and shoulders, screening that
whole side from being seen in the dim light. I also noticed that
E. P. asked one of my friends, who was standing behind my chair
as I controlled during the time of dim light, to go further off, on
the ground that if I were " touched," I might think it was he that
did it.
The second evening Professor Miinsterberg was not present, but
Professor Trowbridge of Princeton, a physicist, was. Otherwise the
group was practically the same. We then tried the experiment of
shifting the cabinet (without previous warning) to the obviously solid
corner of the room, across which we stretched the curtains, as in the
Naples sittings. And I asked Mr. Carrington and the interpreter (one
of my friends spoke Italian like a native) to leave us alone with E. P.
during that sitting, which [they] very courteously did. Under these
conditions the same phenomena as before took place, and in addi-
tion something resembling slightly a palely illuminated hand appeared
in the dim light, three times, above E. P.'s head. Her own hand,
if free, however, could easily have got into that position. And
Prof. Trowbridge told me that at a previous sitting at which he
had been the week before something similar in appearance had shot
swiftly out over the table in front of her—when the light was
dim—and that then it was at a lower level, the level of her shoulder,
at which it would have to be in order to reach out far in front if
it really were her hand thrust out from under the concealing cuitain.
And I came off with the impression that it probably was her hand,
in some way free.
Another thing I noticed that evening was that when the curtain
came out it seemed to me to be rather twitched out from some
point low down—as low down as her waist—than freely blown out
from behind. I was able also from where I stood to reach across
Apeil, 1910. Eiisapia Palladino in America. 269
and feel of it before the movement ceased, and it was drawn, I
thought, quite tensely above the point of movement, which I could
not reach. The corner of a room is a poor place in one way to
locate the cabinet, because no one but the controllers on either
side—whom she controls as well as is controlled by—can get
near it. It also seemed to me that evening that the wind from the
cabinet was caused by the curtain as it was moved, not that it was
the wind that moved it.
That evening E. P. began by saying that she wanted no one to
stand near the controller upon either side, nor as far back as they
towards the cabinet ; that is, she wanted to keep all present within
a certain angle in front of her, as it were. I also noticed that
before the cabinet performances began she gradually worked her
chair and the table back until she practically touched the curtain,
and that she left her controls " con permesso " at times, and stretched
about as though to rest herself, which was, of course, quite natural,
but gave opportunitj-, when the light was dim and the curtain had
blown out over her shoulder, to arrange things in the cabinet or
elsewhere if she wished.
That evening I did not control at all myself, but getting as close
as I could behind one of my friends who was controlling, in the
cabinet period of the seance, I found myself able to see into the
cabinet, as soon as the curtain on my side had been blown out
and was resting on her shoulder, with considerable distinctness,
thanks to the white-plastered, sloping wall, and I made up my mind
that whatever took place in it had its origin behueen her and the
object moved, and not behind the latter. Moreover, all the move-
ments that took place from the cabinet outward seemed to have the
character of ones due to . sudden pulls—or pushes—not to any per-
sistently acting force ;
e.g. the little table seemed to me to be thrown
out always—even when, one time, it was thrown out on top of the
other—and not to be propelled by any steady force.
The third evening—the sittings were on the 13th, 16th and 18th of
December—more people were present than previously, a dozen or so
in all, besides herself and those wlio came with her, the interpreter,
a stenographer, and Mi', and Mrs. Carrington, but several of the.se
had been present at the other sittings. That evening we began by
asking E. P. to let herself be searched by two ladies who were
present by my own arrangement. This was done quite thoroughly,
by their report, but I noticed that E. P. did not, they told me
afterward, take off her boots, which did not occur to them as
270 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 191.o.
necessary. I merely made a mental note of the fact at the time,
but afterwards it seemed important. The cabinet was now back
in its old place, in the recess in the boarding, which gave those
present and not controlling more room to get near, or in a line at
least with the front of, the cabinet.
In the first part of the sitting there were levitations of the table in
full light, as before, and these we could in no way explain. Professor
Miinsterberg was controlling on one side ; one of my friends—a keen,
intelligent, and younger man—upon the other. I was free, and could
see jilainly under the table as it rose. Her knees were not lifted,
ber hands were above the table and in control, and one of my friends
once ran his hand down between her body and the table as it was
rising. None of us indeed, however sceptical, who were present at
any of these sittings have yet been able to suggest any explanation
for these full-light levitations. I think it possible that they may be
genuine.
After a while the light was turned down—that is, a bulb covered
with dark-red paper was used instead of the plain bulb—and things
began to happen in the cabinet, the curtain having first blown out)
or been drawn out, as usual, and resting on her shoulder—her left
shoulder it was. Prof. Miinsterberg had not been " touched " ; she
was asked to "touch" him—that is, to get him "touched"—the same
thing if you will ! To bring this about she brought him from control-
ling on her rigid side to her left. I had noticed previously that the
things done from the cabinet seemed to come mainly from one side
or the other at any given time, not from both indifferently. M.
was then touched on the arm ; I was standing behind him, a little
way off but leaning forward with my hands resting on the back of
his chair.
One of the friends who had come with me, a younger man,
active, quick and cool, stooped down between me and M.'s chair, to
watch, if possible, if anything came out from the cabinet. The
room was then quite dark (with a single red light), and being unseen
behind M.'s chair and E. P. being then close to the cabinet
with the curtain {i.e. a strip of it) drawn over her left shoulder,
which further prevented her from seeing as from being seen, my
friend gradually stretched out upon the floor until his head was in
the cabinet, and lay there watching.
A suggestion was then made that the little table should be brought
out again—it had already been thrown out once and been replaced,
and E. P., I think, had herself replaced it where it then was standing
I
Apeil, 1910. Eusapia Palladino in America. 271
—when suddenly my friend saw a foot, no boot upon it, above him
in the dim light, and took hold of it. E. P. screamed out, in Italian
of course, that some one had touched her foot. He let go immediately
and drew cjuietly back, rising up behind me in the dark, so that
he remained throughout unseen. At the moment no one, I think,
but myself knew what had happened, and one of the other men
present, familiar with her stances, who happened to be standing
opposite me, behind her right control, remarked that it was "very
extraordinary," he had " never known of Eusapia's being '
touched
'
before." She herself was very much disturbed ; accused a quite
innocent person—who did not even know what had happened—of
having crept into the cabinet ; and then exclaimed that the newspapers
would say, the next morning, that she did things with her foot.
Nothing more of importance happened after that. She kept re-
curring to it, that some one had touched her foot ; but she did not
seem at the end to be as h} sterical, I thought, as previously at
the trance's end, which left me with a question as to how real the
hysteria and exhaustion had been in which the other trances had
seemed to leave her.
Now, to go back, the foot, when my friend grasped it, must from
his position have been at least two feet behind her. At the same
time Prof. Miinsterberg—and it was unmistakably upon his side—was
quite unconscious that he was not " controlling "—able to account
for, that is —that same foot, which was placed on his and pressing
continuously on it at the time, he tells me. That she released her
foot from under mine in a previous sitting and placed it above, I
have already mentioned. The simplest explanation would seem to
be, I think, that she has very supple feet and limbs, and draws
her foot out from her boot, which she still continues to hold
down in some way—with some attachment on the other foot con-
ceivably—on the controller's foot while she uses her own to move
things in the cabinet, and probably to touch the controllers on the
arm or elsewhere. Mr. Carrington told me in the beginning that
everything that happened took place within four feet of her. Now
this is just about the reach of leg and foot, if she has a chance
under the cover of the extended curtain and the darkness to stretch
out at length. I think she also reaches back and places things in
the cabinet where she can reach them later, when she stops and
frees herself to " rest." She rearranges the curtain then, and might
easily arrange the things behind it too, for the room is dark and
she is close to the curtain, where she could readily reach back.
272 Journal of Society for Psycldcal Research. April, 1910.
In my three sittings there was nothing that took place in con-
nection with the cabinet that could not easily be explained by a
free foot or hand, used skilfully ; and that she does use both, and
skilfully, there now can be no doubt. The levitation of the larger
table in full light I am rather inclined to believe in as genuine,
as I have already said, partly because the control of eye as well
as touch seems, in this case, to be so good ; and if this be
genuine, perhaps other things are genuine too. But I feel quite
sure myself that none of those we saw were so, apart from the
levitations of the larger table. E. P. certainly has a well worked out
system for doing things by trickery if they fail to do themselves.
The knocking of the table, bidding people talk, is part of it, no
doubt. Mr. Carrington told me it seemed to " help things to
happen "
—and I think it did. The tying of the feet—which we
did one evening at her suggestion—I think must hold the hoot,
not the foot.
The man controlling opposite Prof Munsterberg at the time of the
foot incident was an unusually intelligent, clear-witted younger man,
and an old friend of mine, who had been present at all three
sittings and had controlled before. He, like Prof. Miinsterberg,
was quite unconscious at the time of her having escaped in any
way from his control. Nor did she probably, as it was quite
evidently on Prof. Miinsterberg's side that she had freed herself.
But he was also watching closely, and feels quite certain of the
pressure of her foot—as he thought it—on his at the time the thing
took place. He now thinks the touch he felt just previously was
no doubt her toes, reaching up under the cover of the extended
curtain to his right arm. G. B. Dour.
After writing this letter, Mr. Dorr obtained the following
statements from the sitter who grasped the foot and from
Professor Miinsterberg. In sending us the original account of
the former Mr. Dorr calls attention to his own error in stating
that the foot was seen in the cabinet ; the dim light and the
shadow of the extended curtain precluded sight, and the foot
was grasped on the indication of sound alone. The writer of
the account is an old friend of Mr. Dorr's ; what he did was
done upon his own initiative, as he saw the opportunity offered
him and took it, and not in consequence of any suggestion
from Professor Munsterberg, whom he had met for the first
time that evening. His name and address were given to us, but

we were asked not to print them, as he wished to avoid being
involved in the notoriety which the incident had gained in
America. He writes as follows
February 9fh, 1910.
I wish here to place on record my impressions of what happened
at the seance of Eusapia Palladino which I attended in New York.
During the early part of the evening I acted as " control " of
Eusapia's left arm and left leg, while Professor Hugo Miinsterberg had
control of her right arm and leg. The usual phenomena occurred
as described in the various reports of the E. P. sittings. The only
difference that I see from the reports which I happen to have read
was the very much larger number present. There were in the
room, including Eusapia, the stenographer, and Mr. and Mrs.
Carrington, seventeen people.
At the end of a considerable time I signified my intention of
giving up my place, which Miinsterberg took, his place being
taken by a well-known scientist, the President of a scientific body
in New York.
During my " control " I had been touched several times in the
right ribs, and so when the manifestations had progressed and the
room returned to its darkened condition, I dropped to the floor and
glided back of Miinsterberg's chair. There I lay in a strained
position for a long time with my open hand covering his ribs hoping
that whatever had touched me would touch him, intending instantly
to close on it. Nothing, however, happened, except that I lost my
balance slightly, owing to the strain of my position, and I lightly
brushed M.'s ribs by mistake.
I then crept back to the furthest end of the table from E., and
resumed my standing position among the onlookers in order to
rest from the long strain of my position. It must be realized that
during all this time the curtain of the cabinet had been blown or
lifted on to the table and completely filled the gap between Eusapia
and Miinsterberg. Realizing that probably no one but you [Mr.
Dorr] would notice another attempt, I once more dropped to the
floor and glided on my stomach along the back of Miinsterberg's
chair, but instead of stopping there I crept on to the extreme edge
of the cabinet. Of course that side was open, as the curtain was
on the table between E. and M. Just as I got there the table
was upset and almost fell on my face. It was then lying half
inside and half outside the cabinet and I right beside it. I lay
there from then on, with my left hand raised ready to intercept
274 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, i9io.
anything that might be between the small table and Eusapia's
chair. I had already felt all up and down the table to see if
there could be anything there, but it was completely clear. I here
draw a rough plan of the situation at this moment, although it
is not in scale. ;
As my position made it possible to intercept anything returning
from the table to E., I determined to wait for the first slight
movement of the table, as earlier in the evening it had first upset
in the cabinet and then later on shot out behind my chair when I
was the left "control." I did not know what to expect, —a wire
hook, possibly electricity, —when suddenly the table moved and I
instantly closed in to intercept, and my fingers closed firmly on
a human foot in rapid motion which was stopped and arrested by
my hand. My fingers were over the instep and my hand closed
firmly on it. It was then that Eusapia gave a piercing shriek and
I glided quickly back in the darkness towards the other end of the
table, where I resumed my standing position. Eusapia's outcry,
followed by continuous wailings that she had been seized by the
foot, so distracted the attention of the general company that I
escaped detection except by you and by one of the ladies present.
I was very much aided in being able to remain so long near
the centre of action unobserved by the fact that there were so
many people present. As the curtain was lying on the table between
Miinsterberg and Eusapia, the journey from his chair to the cabinet
was comparatively safe as long as it was accomplished in perfect
silence.
If at any time you require this statement in a more formal
character, please send me a type-written copy of it and I will swear
to it before a notary public.
Professor Miinsterberg wrote to Mr. Dorr as follows
Cambridge, Massachusetts,
January 19, 1910.
In accordance with your request I state here in writing what I
at once told you orally after our seance with Madame Palladino
April, 1910. Eusapia Palladino in America. 275
on December 18th, the second in which I took part. I understand
that you are interested only in a statement concerning those observa-
tions which have reference to Madame Palladino's situation at the
time when her foot was grasped in the cabinet.
At the moment when her screaming indicated that she was
grasped, I felt sure that I held her left hand with my right hand
and that I felt her left shoe on my right foot. Moreover I felt
sure that no change in the pressure of the shoe had occurred
during the preceding minutes. I believed myself to feel both the
heel and the sole of her left shoe, while it was her left foot which
reached out for the table in the cabinet. Inasmuch as the gentle-
man on her right side also felt her whole foot on his foot, I
consider it impossible that a substitution had set in by which her
right foot gave to both her neighbours the feeling of being touched
by her shoe. As throughout that part of the seance I gave my
fullest attention to my foot sensations, I must believe that her
right foot remained on the foot of her right neighbour and that her
left shoe remained on my foot.
The skill with whicli she succeeded in removing her foot from
the shoe without giving me the slightest suspicion appears to me
marvellous. By my laboratory work I am accustomed to careful
observation of impressions. I gave my full attention to the tactual
sensations which her shoe produced on my foot, and yet I did not
notice anything of the change until the scream occurred. On the
other hand I confess that the surprise of the scream withdrew my
attention for a few seconds so fully from the tactual sensations that
later I was unable to remember what happened immediately after
the surprise. Certainly when I turned my attention to my foot
again, her foot was in the shoe once more. But it may be that a
minute had elapsed since the excitement which the scream
produced.
Let me add that the gentleman who caught Madame Palladino's
foot in the cabinet told me a few minutes afterwards that he had
grasped it near the heel and that the foot was without a shoe.
The tactual sensations which I perceived at the arm were also such
as an unshod foot might easily produce with the toes, while a
shoe could not have given them.

MR. G. W. BALFOUR ON PSYCHICAL RESEARCH
AND PHILOSOPHY.
An important article by Mr. Gerald Balfour has appeared in the
Hihhert Journal for April, 1910, on "Psychical Research and Current
Doctrines of Mind and Body." These he divides into three principal
varieties, namely :
(1) Parallelism, which holds that between mind and brain inter-
action is inconceivable ; neither can influence the other. Yet they
are so closely related that to every change in the mental series a
change in the physical series exactly corresponds.
(2) Epiphenomenalism, which also asserts that every mental event
has its exact counterpart in a brain event ; but that, while conscious-
ness cannot influence the molecular changes in the brain, the molecular
changes in the brain are the cause, and the sole immediate cause, of
all conscious states.
(3) Interactionism, which—like Parallelism —recognises both a dis-
parity and a correlation between the mental and the physical series,
but holds that the two series may be causally related to each other
and that the relation of the mind with the brain is one of reciprocal
influence.
After explaining briefly the essential features and some of the
consequences of these doctrines, the writer goes on to consider whether
any fresh light is thrown on the Cjuestion of the relation of mind
and body by the special investigations to which Psj'chical Research
is directed. He shows that if empirical proof were produced that
the individual mind may survive bodily death, carrying with it
sufficient of its earthly memories to maintain continuity between its
discarnate and its corporeal existence, the doctrine of Parallelism
and still more that of Epiphenomenalism—would, so far as we can
see, have to be abandoned, and some modification of the Inter-
actionist theory—involving a doctrine of the relations of soul and
body rather than of mind and brain—would seem to remain the
only one tenable.
The evidence for individual survival, however, in Mr. Balfour's
opinion, falls considerably short of proof, but telepathy between
the living is in his view an established fact, and he expresses his
astonishment at the readiness with which the ordinary educated
public (we may add, with little or no examination of the evidence
on which it rests) have adopted a behef in telepathy, while they
fail to see how profoundly even this belief should modify all current
psycho-physical doctrines. Finally, he points out that, though
the evidence for survival is seriously weakened by the counter
hypothesis of telepathic faculty combined with subliminal agency;
on the other hand, if a mind associated with a brain can be in
direct telepathic relation with some other mind, there is at least a
prima facie ground for supposing that this relation may subsist after
the destruction of the brain.

DISCUSSION OF THE NAPLES EEPOET ON EUSAPIA
PALLADINO.
I AM sorry that the conditions of investigation accepted by our
Committee and explained in their Report on Eusapia Palladino
should not meet with Miss Stawell's approval ; but I think in her
criticism, published in the February Journal, she sometimes seeks
to put a construction on words and reported actions they do not
fairly bear.
She begins her paper by speaking of the " suspicious circum-
stances " and " obvious attempts at trickery " described on pp. 338,
383, 400, and 543. (Proceedings, Vol. XXIII.)
It is well known that things take place during Eusapia's seances
which do seem to be attempts at fraud, but during the present
investigation they seem to have been very rare. Miss Stawell calls
attention to only 4 as having occurred throughout the 13 seances
reported ; there were, however, one or two more. I do not know
the reason for this, but, if other things are shown to have been
unaccountably abnormal, rare attempts at fraud of the description
mentioned in Miss Stawell's paper, even granting that they do
take place, are in my opinion of no consequence.
Miss Stawell now goes into greater detail to show that Mr.
Podmore's views are warranted, and because she cannot " see how
to make the shorthand report consistent with F.'s later notes about
the substitution of hands and the seizing of Mrs. H.'s wrist," she
concludes it is not so, and makes some remarks on the difficult}^ of
278 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 1910.
accurate memory, tending to depreciate the evidence tendered by
our Committee.
(1) As to the "substitution of hands" affair, if Miss Stawell had
enquired she might have found out that the shorthand notes (Pro-
ceedings, Vol. XXIII. p. .540) are not inconsistent with the supple-
mentary information given on p. 541 —that what took place
between 10.30 and 10.34 during Seance XL, was in fact as follows:
(ft) E. P. substituted part of her right hand for her left, un-
perceived by Mrs. H.
(h) F. saw E. P.'s left hand moving towards the curtain and
asked Mrs. H. if she was holding the medium's left hand. Mrs.
H.'s attention being thus attracted to what her right hand was
holding, she became aware, by feeling the thumb-nail of the medium's
right hand, and probably other indications, of the substitution that
had taken place and answered, "No, she has made a substitution."
(c) F. now exclaimed " substitution of hands " in such a way as
to attract the attention of the stenographer, who recorded this
remark, and also that of Mrs. H. which followed, namely, " I
thought that I had still hold of the medium's left hand."
(2) Frotn what I read on p. 549, it appears that what F.
dictated for note by Mr. Meeson, namely, " Mrs. H.'s hand was
seized by the wrist by a hand and dragged across the table to
touch B.'s face " must have been prompted by what Mi'S. H. told
him (unless Mrs. H. dictated it herself), for although he saw her
hand move across the table, he did not "see any hand holding it."
I fail to recognise any want of consistency.
(3) Miss Stawell is struck by what she considers the incessant
changes in the position of Eusapia's hands, and gives the following
example from the report of Seance VI. 12.30, of how she thinks
such changes may "provide the opportunity for the phenomena,
fleeting as these are." She cjuotes from p. 453 the shorthand
notes of what took place, and asks whether there might not have
been time between that at which E. P. withdrew her hand from
F.'s and replaced it in B.'s to have done some act which caused C.
to aver that he saw a head come out from the curtains slowly and
to within six inches of his head, stay out about two seconds and
then go back. I do not know—-but granting that E. P. took more
than two seconds to move her hand from F.'s to B.'s, what C. saw
was a head, not a hand. If he saw this head come out from
behind the curtains to the left of Eusapia's head, it could not have
been represented by her hand, because she could not have got it
May, 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 279
into that position. If not so, however, remembering that Eusapia's
head was resting against C.'s head, and her left hand in his, so
that, when she put her right hand inside the curtain to take F.'s,
she must have swung her right shoulder back, and the only way
she could have performed the miracle imputed to her must have
been
(rt) To change the appearance of her hand to that of a head.
(b) To swing this false head right across in front of B., to
pause a moment close to C.'s head, then repass B. and
gain the shelter of the curtain.
(c) To permit her hand to re-assume its ordinary shape and
then replace itself in B.'s.^
(4) Miss Stawell's next remarks refer to the statement that during
Seance V. 11.8, the little table struck B. under the shoulder
(p. 429). She quotes the following sentence from " Remarks on the
seance" (V. p. 420). "From 10.52 onwards there were a series of
movements of the small table and of other objects behind the cur-
tain, culminating at 11.8 by the small table striking B. on the
shoulder and upsetting completely, the medium being rigorously
held, visible and motionless," and from this she infers that the
intention is to imply that E. P. was "held, visible and motionless"
from 10.52 to 11.8. I could draw no such conclusion, but if for a
moment I did entertain it, a glance at the shorthand report of the
seance would be enough to dispel that error.
She goes on to remark on the incessant motion of E. P.'s limbs,
and would, I think, like the reader to infer that the movements of
the things behind the curtain were caused by Eusapia, owing to the
want of control exercised by the experimenters. I maintain, however,
that since the table and the other things were behind the curtain,
and the curtain behind the medium's chair, she could not have been
the cause of their movement with even much more liberty of action
than the report grants her. Miss Stawell describes the medium's
left leg as "kicking backwards and forwards," but forgets to say
that it was under the table and under F.'s control. To Miss
Stawell the fact that on one occasion it was found that Eusapia
had only buttoned her boots by the top button " suggests pre-
paration for slipping her foot in and out
;
" to me it suggests
slovenliness only.
^ The above speculation is, however, needless, for on enquiry I find that
"tlie head appeared after Eusapia had replaced her hand on B.'s."
280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 1910.
But to go back to Mr. Feilding's original statement on p. 420,
that when the table struck B. Eusapia was " rigorously held, visible
and motionless" (pp. 420 and 429) and Miss Stawell's that "it
was after the table has struck B. at 11.8 that the medium appears
to have become motionless."
Here are two statements which cannot both be true, one made
by a witness of the event, the other by one who was not. In order
to settle which is correct, let us turn to the shorthand report made
at the time, and then and there recorded.
"11.8 p.m. B. The little table struck me under the shoulder
and fell over completely on the right of the medium.
" B. At the same moment she was holding my left hand with
her right, and her right foot was resting on my left foot. I felt
the whole length of her leg against my leg.
" F. Her left hand is in my left, on the corner of the table. My
right hand across both knees. Her left leg motionless. Her left
foot on my right foot, and I know it is the whole of it. Her head
close to me and motionless and clearly visible.
"B. Her head is visible to me as well."
This appears to me inconsistent with Miss Stawell's statement.
Finally, in this section of her remarks. Miss Stawell thinks it likely
that E. P. " substituted a dummy hand for her right during Seances
v., VI., and VII."! "Possible," "conceivable," it may be; but
I think—in the face of the report of those present—altogether
unlikely. 1
(5) i^ajjs, p. 334.
Under this heading Miss Stawell calls attention to par. 10, page
537 :
" Finally the series of raps produced on the door leading
into B.'s room, at the side of the cabinet, at the close of the
seance (XL), which must be regarded as the only really evidential
raps obtained throughout the whole series. The No. I. Light was
on, and the room additionally flooded with light through the open
door of the next room."
She explains these raps by supposing a confederate of Eusapia's
crot into B.'s room and made them in answer to signals; of course
this is a possible explanation, but under the circumstances not a
likely one.
(a) Miss Stawell says the door from B.'s room opening on the
^Mr. Baggally, who is tlie witness most concerned, repudiates my expressions
"possible, conceivable,"' as completely wide of the mark.
Mat, 1910. TJte Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 281
passage was not locked. i My own experience of continental hotels
is, that bedroom doors are always kept locked.
{b) She says that Signor Zingaropoli remained in the seance room.
This gentleman is not mentioned in the report of what took
place, made at the time, but Mr. Baggally in his final report made
in March, 1909, says, "This lady (Mrs. H.) retained her seat on the
left of the medium and I retained mine on her right. The other
persons who had been present at the seances (with the exception of
the stenographer who remained seated at his table) had retired into
C.'s room." 2 She reminds us that Signor Z. is a friend of Eusapia's ;
does she suggest that he was her confederate 1
^
I do not know what they do with strangers who " slip into " the
bedrooms of guests in Italian hotels, but I fancy it is something
not very nice, particularly if they gain admittance by help of a
skeleton key.
How does Miss Stawell imagine that the necessary signals were
made 1 Did one of them perhaps consist in scratching the back of
B.'s hand 1
As to the raps being described as both "loud" and "feeble," it
must be remembered that these are merely relative terms.
(6) Levitations, p. 331 (1).
The view that the occurrence of levitations in the presence of
Eusapia may be denied on a jrriori grounds is reasonable ; but to
argue from the report published that the members of our Committee
were mistaken when they thought there was no adequate physical
connection between the medium and the things levitated seems to
me unreasonable on the part of one who was not present at the
seances, and whose opportunity of judging must be small compared
with theirs.
The first instance of levitation of the seance table criticised by
Miss Stawell is one which took place during the first seance at
iln fact, the door of B.'s room oijetis, not on the passage, but into a dressing-
room, the door of which, he assures me, it was his custom to lock whenever he
left the room, aud he has no recollection of not having done so on this occasion.
- Or this may be looked at from the point of view of arithmetic—Present,
6 persons, three (H., B., and M.) remaining in the seance-room and "three
of the company going into the room on the other side (C.'s room)" (Miss
Stawell's Paper, p. 234).
•^Ou referring this to Mr. Baggally, he says, "Miss Stawell's implied assertion
that Signor Zingaropoli was a confederate cannot be entertained. Tliis gentleman
occupies a very high position in the legal department of Naples municipality."
282 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, may, loio.
11.44. In the report of this case the description given of the con-
trol exercised is not quite accurate owing to some confusion in the
use of the words " right " and " left," this confusion would no doubt
be cleared up by means of a question or two addressed to the
witnesses ; ^ still the main point is, that the experimenters who
were on the spot were satisfied that the levitations were " genuine."
If Miss Stawell wishes to criticise the report of levitations, she
should attack the strongest cases she can find, and had she drawn
attention to the one that occurred at 11.43, one minute before the
one the evidence for which she attacks, she would have been unable
to show any confusion in the wording of the description of the
control exercised, and would have had to meet in addition the evi-
dence of the shorthand writer, Mr. Meeson, who says, " I could see
the table in the air with nobody touching it," and this in Light I.
(7) Objects emerging from the Cabinet.
The shape, colour, and size of the objects observed to emerge
from the cabinet, are, no doubt, matters of interest, but our
enquiry is rather whether this emergence was the result of some
physical action on the medium's part or not.
Read the report of a " white hand " coming out from behind the
curtain at 12.9 a.m., during Seance VII. p. 477, and say whether
that report leaves any room for supposing it to be Eusapia's hand,
particularly when the outsider has to judge by the written record,
as Miss Stawell (p. 2.37) maintains he must.
(8) The transportation of the clay on the board.
In her criticism of this incident, Miss Stawell commences by
saying, "If Eusapia once got her left hand free," but this is, I
think, a bold suggestion when its possibility is denied as follows, by
three responsible witnesses.
Says E. " My right hand was lying perfectly flat on the middle
of the table, and her left hand was stroking my wrist " (p. 496).
Says F. " Her right hand was continuously in mine." If the
medium's right hand was under F.'s, as the Committee agree in
saying (p. 485), it could not have been the one stroking B.'s
without F. being aware of it ; but F. has more to say ; he writes :
"Eusapia's two hands were both visible, her left on R.'s right hand
^ The following question addressed to Mr. Carriiigton was all that was
necessary—"I cannot follow the explanation, p. 353, unless in line nine, 'right
hand' should have been 'left hand.' Is it so?" The answer from Mr.
Carrington was "Yes."
May, 1910. The Naples Report on Eusaioia Pcdladino. 283
near the middle of the table, her right hand under my right hand
about a foot distant from her left" (p. 503), and lastly, C. says
(p. 503), "It would have been an utter impossibility for the medium
{even supposing that she had her left hand free) to have placed the
clay in the position in which I first saw it ( x 2 on plan, p. 503), and
then to have moved it on to the seance table." Certainly not without
being discovered, for as they could see the clay and board move
.slowly out, they could also have seen the medium's hand carrying it.
The above rather strongly suggests to me that E. P. did not get
her left hand free ; Miss Stawell, on the contrary, gains an opposite
suggestion, just as powerful, perhaps, from the facts that half an
hour before one curtain had been right over the table, that the
medium's two hands were resting on the table, about a foot apart,
visible and controlled respectively by F. and R. and that " one at
least of her hands was moving about,"—was stroking R.'s wrist, if
that is what you call " moving about."
Commenting on C.'s report, Miss Stawell says (p. 237), " It
seems as though it must have been very hard to detect a slight
movement of the black curtain in that dim light (Light III.) and
from the angle where he (C.) was standing, (see plan, p. 503)."
A slight movement !
—If Eusapia had leant back in her chair and
thrust her hand into the cabinet (her left hand is, I suppose,
suggested) between the two curtains, and then brought it round
and out of the cabinet again between the left-hand curtain and the
wall, by the window, and so back to the middle of the table, the
whole of the left-hand curtain would have been gathered up in her
left arm and carried forward so as to cover the left-hand corner of
the table at least. If she had thrust her hand into the cabinet by
the wall, the disturbance to the curtain would not have been
"slight," as Miss Stawell describes it, but considerable, even before
she was able to get at the clay at all.
(9) The cold breeze and the curtain lulging, etc.
For between 20 and 30 years Eusapia has been before the public,
-during which time the phenomena occurring in her presence have
been enquired into, examined and re-examined by eminent scientific
men of all nationalities, yet, as far as I know, no evidence has been
forthcoming that she provides herself secretly with apparatus for
fraudulent purposes, and if any such evidence exists, I feel confident
that Miss Stawell would have brought it forward in support of her
theories ; instead of that, however, she now floats away on the wings
of an imagination which despises all difficulties of manipulation and
284 Jottrnal of Society for Psychical ResearcJt. Mat, i9io.
any inference which might be drawn from the non-discovery, during
so many years, of these hypothetical tools.
Miss Stawell supposes Eusapia to provide herself, as occasion re-
quires, with tubes, bulbs, bladders, dummy hands, crooked wires, and
phosphorus, but when we come to look more closely at how these
things are to be used for fraudulent purposes, it seems to me that
they will require for their manipulation, hands free beyond all
freedom that " substitution " could give them, and also that the
effect they are supposed to serve could be, in many cases, much
more easily produced without their aid.
If, for example, the dummy hand was used to deceive during
Seances V. VI. and VIII., its use seems a needless refinement,
seeing that Eusapia's own hand must itself have been behind the
curtain to hold it.^ Again, if a bladder at the end of a tube is
supposed to be the device by means of which the curtains are made
" to balloon out in a round bulge " the bladder itself must have been
held behind the curtains; Eusapia with her naked hand, without the
bladder, could make c|uite as effective a demonstration with no risk
of any apparatus being discovered, and without the trouble of getting
the thing out from between her "skin and her combinations,"
inflating it, etc., etc.
Miss Stawell says that " the description of the . . . curtain-bulging
seems exactly to suit the effect that might be produced by such a
bladder dilated at will;" but the experimenters say : "If we made a
sudden grab at the bulge, no resistance was encountered. . .
." Now,
if the bulge was made by a bladder being pressed against the
curtain from behind, it would be distinctly felt by any one who
suddenly grabbed at the bulge.
(10) Dress swelling.
Perhaps the dress swelling is not incompatible with the use of the
supposed bladder, but from my ignorance of ladies' underclothing I
cannot follow the arrangements described; a good deal depends on
the size of the swelling and the consequent size of the bladder.
The diflBculty of deflating the bladder without noise also has to be
considered.
(11) Movements of the little table.
" Most of these movements," says Miss Stawell, " can be explained
on the quite possible supposition that Eusapia got one hand or foot
1
To suppose that the Committee could have been deceived by a detached inflated
thing placed loosely on the table under the curtain seems to me preposterous.
May, 1910. Tlie Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 285'
free." The supposition does not seem to me quite so possible as she
would have it. In the only instance, as Miss Stawell thinks, in
which the movements of the small table could not have been caused
by one hand or foot unassisted by apparatus, was at 11.55, during
Seance II. when she supposes the use of a thin wire about the
thickness of a hairpin— how long this wire is supposed to be she-
does not say, though this dimension is of vital importance. In any
case, the wire could only assist the medium in either drawing the
table towards her or pushing it directly away, if that ;
but, as far
as I can follow the report, it seems that the table moved from some
position on the floor to the right of the medium to a position in
the cabinet directly behind her, and this change of position could
not be effected by any direct push or pull.
I have a little table, weighing just about 7 lbs., which I put on
the bare floor and tried to move with a wire, gauge 18, length
3 ft. 6 inches. I could not move it. I then tried a piece of wire,
gauge 16, of the same length, and found that by bending an end I
could pull the table to me, but not push it away. It was not till
I tried a wire of the gauge 10 that I could cause any motion of
translation except directly towards or away from myself, and then
only partially and with difficulty. I had, however, I expect, not so-
smooth a surface to work upon as the possibly polished floor of the
room in Naples.
(12) Twanging the Guitar.
Of this phenomenon Miss Stawell takes two cases on which she
comments.
In the first case, during Seance II., she says :
" Is it out of the
fjuestion " that in good light the medium should with a wire pluck
the strings of a guitar which was over three feet away directly
behind her chair, with an overset table between them, this wire
being held in one of her hands, hands which the experimenters
thought they were controlling, or actuated in some mysterious way
with her foot ? If asked, I should answer " quite." Think what
length of wire this supposition would require—3 feet and over
just get a piece of jvire of this length and No. 18 gauge, which is.
that of an average hairpin, take it by one end and see what you
can do with the other—you will be astonished !
On the second case, Seance VI., her comments are four in number :
{a) "After the shorthand notes ended"—Yes, because the full
light had been turned on, indicating the end of the
sitting.
286 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 191.o.
{h) " When they thought the seance was over, and therefore
could not have been controlling her so carefully." The
medium was standing up outside the curtain, "her two
feet were controlled by those on either side of her (C. and
F.), and her two hands held."
{<:)
" When B. and M. were talking," but C. and F. listening
and giving their whole attention to what was going forward.
{(1)
" When Eusapia might have imitated the slight sound of
the twanging that they heard." She may have been able
to do this, but those standing by her do not think so.
"That she does imitate sounds," continues Miss Stawell, "is
the almost inevitable inference from the 'kiss' episode, see
Seance VII. 12 p.m." But if a " kiss," the sound of which is
so easily reproduced, was so badly imitated on that occasion
as to be described as "clicking of the nails," how can we
suppose that she imitated the vibration of a guitar string
so well as to deceive two critical witnesses standing one
on each side of her 1
(13) Movements of the Curtains.
On the assumption that Eusapia surreptitiously got one hand free,
it is legitimate to suppose that she used the freedom of a hand to
cause movements of the curtain with it, but it seems to me far-
ifetched as a theory to suppose that she used the freedom of a
ihand to lay a hypothetical wire " aslant on the floor " " one end
under her left foot, the other slipped through the opening behind
.the edge of the right curtain," and then to suppose that by a jerk
of the foot she could cause "the whole of the left edge of the
right curtain" to rush out and "completely envelop her right side."
In this connection Miss Stawell writes :
" For instance, she might
have pulled the curtain with her own hand, as B. actually caught
her doing with the verj^ hand F. was controlling at the time " (Seance
VIII. 12.43, note by B.). This sentence would convey to an average
reader the suggestion that B. had caught the medium doing some-
thing fraudulently and surreptitiously, when in fact F. says " She
appeared to give these [pulls] quite openly and without concealment
from me."
(14) Movements of the little Stool.
Under this heading Miss Stawell in her remarks suggests a
situation so different from that disclosed by the report that it is
difficult to suppose her serious.
Mat, 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 287
She takes two cases.
(a) During Seance IX. 11.45, that which she describes as having
taken place in " poorish light" is spoken of by B., who was present,
remember, as being observed in " a very good light."
Also, if the account given by M. of his examination of the stool,
p. 514, be compared with what Miss Stawell says about it, it will at
once be seen what a different impression is conveyed by the report
and the conjecture.
(h) The second case is one from " Seance XI. 12.26, when the
stool climbed up the curtain."
All I can say is, that whatever force was used to make the stool
climb up the curtain, it was not exercised through the medium's left
hand, because at the moment that it would have required the
support of that hand or fallen to the ground, the hand named was
believed by Mrs. H. to be in hers, and was felt to be there by M.,
whom F. saw feel for it. Miss Stawell, from experiments she has
made, thinks it quite possible to make a small stool climb up a
curtain, using her left hand only, but I fear that the movement of
the stool she speaks of is not the motion of the stool as reported
by two witnesses,' namely, " It slid past the curtain, which remained
motionless," and "The stool appeared to slide along the stuff of the
curtain."
Miss Stawell requires for her experiments that part of the bottom
of the curtain be held taut and at a certain angle, and for her
theory, I presume, that Eusapia's left leg should be out of control.
(15) The Touches.
About the touches felt bj^ B. during the Seance X. at 12.11 and
12.20, Miss Stawell says that they correspond suspiciously with the
presence of a photographer, but as far as I can see, no photographer
is reported to have been present, that is, in the room, and why
should his presence in another room be thought suspicious ?
^
That F. found the medium's right hand in the "Substitution
position " at a moment when the position of her left hand rendered
substitution impossible, strengthens the inference that the touches
that B. felt were not made by either of Eusapia's hands. Miss
Stawell omits to notice the statement made by F. the morning after
the seance was held about this incident, namely, that " After this,
B. and I together controlled both the medium's hands, I leaning
1 Simply by asking the question I found that there were no photographers
present at all at this time, they had been dismissed previously.
288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 1910.
over to B.'s side of the table. The touches, however, on B.'s back
still continued as before." This was at 12.13 and 12.20, when the
control was particularly attended to, and described in the report
made at the time.
Of the touches during Seance XI. 12.51 Miss Stawell says :
(a) " These occurred after the control was no longer to be given
[reported] in full " —but there is no reason for thinking that it wa&
any the less rigidly maintained on that account.
(6) Miss Stawell complains that the light was " dim." It was,,
but what I have to complain of is that although B. says " I can
see both the medium's hands on the table," Miss Stawell should say
he only thought he saw. What a man is able to see depends on
the goodness of his eyesight, and the man himself must, I think,
be a better judge of how much he sees than any other person.
(c) Miss Stawell calls attention to the fact that it was only after
12.56, when the curtain was blown over the table, that B. held
both Eusapia's hands and was touched nevertheless, and she con-
tinues, " Then he only held her thumbs, so that her fingers were
free." Miss Stawell puts the words "her fingers were free" in
italics, to suggest, I suppose, that those free fingers were concerned
in the touches felt by B.^ but this is what is reported by
witnesses present at the time :
" B. now takes hold of both thumbs of medium in his right hand.
"F. B.'s left hand lying on the corner of the table, and a hand
from inside the curtain plays with it. Meanwhile B. is now holding
the two thumbs of the Medium in his right hand, visibly to me
(page 55.3).
There now only remains to consider the suggestion that E.P.
brought phosphorus witli her to Seances VII. and XL
Ten minutes after Eusapia "puts her head behind the curtain
and makes a sudden dive to the right," B. reports "Both C. and I
saw a brilhant light inside the cabinet about 2^ feet from the
medium, inside the right hand curtain." " It was about 3 feet
from the ground behind the extreme edge of the right curtain
(and would, if it was caused by phosphorus, have required something
to hold it there).
The control is thus described :
" B. Her right hand was on my left hand, but she had lifted
her foot and placed it on the bar of her chair.
1 Mr. Baggally says that the conditions were such that Eusapia's fingers
would have to have been a foot and a half long to do it.
May, 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 289
"F. Her hand in mine on this side of the table and her left
foot was on mine."
I fail to see how this report favours the theory of the presence
of phosphorus.
Miss Stawell, accepting Mr. Baggally's opinion that the lights
seen in the presence of Carancini were produced by phosphorus,
after the use of which no smell was observed, argues that the lights
now under discussion might also have been made by phosphorus,
despite no smell having been perceived.
In the first place, I fear Miss Stawell does not appreciate the
danger and difficulty of dealing with phosphorus in such a way
as to produce lights such as described, if it will produce such.^
Phosphorus is described in the Century Didionarij as " A solid,
non-metallic, combustible substance, (which) exposed to the air at
•common temperatures . . . emits a white vapour of a peculiar garlic
odour." Twelve grains of phosphorus melted in half an ounce
of olive oil and contained in a small bottle is the preparation
usually imagined to be used for fraudulent production of " spirit
lights." On uncorking in the dark this solution emits light and,
permit me to say, also smell.
There are, however, "phosphorescent" substances containing no
phosphorus which may be used for this purpose, such as barium
sulphate, which, properly prepared and sealed up in small glass
tubes after exposure to sunlight, shines with a bright orange
coloured light, or calcium sulphate, which is said to shine even
brighter than the other when similarly dealt witli.
Both in this paper and in that contributed by Mr. Podmore in
December, it seems to me that the authors are more anxious to
criticise the report of the Committee appointed to examine the
phenomena than to ascertain what really occurred ; ljut what actually
did take place in Eusapia's presence is what the Committee was
appointed to enquire into and is that about which the S.P.R. is
particularly concerned. The common-sense way of getting this infor-
mation would be, if any point in the report is considered obscure, to
request the witness or witnesses concerned to throw what light they
can upon it, and only after everj^ means to asceitain what really
occurred had been exhausted to venture an opinion as to how it
was done.
1 A few days ago a chemist who prepared for me a small bottle of
phosphorus oil burned his hands so badly that he is now unable to do his
business and will not have completely recovered under three weeks.
290 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, i9io.
As an illustration of what I consider the vicious method of
enquiry, I would remark how easy it would have been for Miss
Stawell to have asked what had happened in the "substitution of
hands " case, and saved herself the trouble of drawing from an
imperfect conception of the situation the doubtful inference of "how
impossible it is to remember afterwards exactly what took place
at the moment "—the " afterwards " in this case being the next
morning.
In the same way Mr. Podmore also complains that the
Committee's report is indefinite, and " Frequently at the critical
moment the statement is incomplete," p. 174 (2). I agree with him
in this complaint, but the first thing that would occur to me
if I were about to discuss the matter would be to ask those
concerned what the real situation had been. Mr. Podmore continues
a few lines lower down :
" It is probable that Eusapia's right hand
was under the curtain during their progress "—that is, during the
progress for about an hour of various phenomena. How much more
practical applicability his inference would have, namely, the inference
that Eusapia used .
a freed hand between 10.58 and 11.56 to
fraudulently impose on our Committee, had it occurred to
him to ascertain by enquiry whether the place where her right
hand was supposed to be, had, in fact, been covered by the curtain
continually during this hour or not. If it turned out that the
curtain was there all the time, so much the better for Mr.
Podmore's contention. If it was not, then it would have been
better if he had not launched a suggestion resting on inaccuracy.^

REVIEW.
Telepathic Hallucinations : The New Vieiv of Ghosts. By Frank
Podmore. (Milner & Co., Limited, Paternoster Row, London.
1909; XXth Century Science Series.) 128 pp. Price, Is. net.
At the present time there seems to be an increasing tendency to
identify psychical research with the questions of individual survival
after death, and of the possible influence of supposed outside intelli-
gences on human affairs. Yet before any one can be competent
to form an estimate of what evidence exists on these topics, he
must first have made a careful study of the possibilities of super-
1
On reference to one who was present, I am informed that "The curtain
most decidedly did not cover the medium's right hand continuously from
10.58 till 11.56 as Mr. Podmore suggests."
May, 1910. Review. 291
normal mental action as exercised by living persons. It is therefore
most important not to lose sight of the fact that our knowledge of
telepathy is still in a purely empirical stage, and that no greater
service could be done to psychical research than to discover the laws
which govern its operations and so raise it to the rank of a science.
To those unfamiliar with the mass of material to be found in our
Proceedings and Journal, Mr. Podmore's little book will form an
excellent introduction to the subject, for it contains not only a
selection of some of the best authenticated cases, but also a clear
and instructive exposition of the application to them of acknowledged
psychological principles.
Two questions are raised in the book : whether there are
"ghosts" and what "ghosts" are. The first question Mr. Podraore
answers in the affirmative, that is to say, he considers that
the cumulative force of the evidence for apparitions of the
living and the dead is too strong to be resisted. A particular case
may be explained by supposing error or exaggeration on the part
of the percipient, but all collectively cannot be so explained. In
considering the second question, he discusses and rejects the theory
that there is " in each of us a quasi-material form . . . which can
leave the body for a time during life, which must leave it per-
manently at death, and which can, under favourable conditions,
make itself visible to mortal eyes." "There is no evidence, (he says,)
for such entities : for apparitions have never furnished proof of their
kinship with matter, and recent discoveries of science show us that
they are to be regarded rather as sensory hallucinations " (a term
which is carefully and clearly explained by Mr. Podmore). But to
say this is not to say that they ai'e necessarily subjective in origin,
for these apparitions are often seen when the person whom they
resemble is ill or dying ; and from a consideration of the evidence
afforded by the Census of Hallucinations, it appears that such co-
incidences are too numerous to be ascribed to chance. The evidence
for experimental and spontaneous telepathy is next briefly reviewed,
with special reference to the experiments conducted by Mrs. Sidgwick
and Miss Alice Johnson, by Professor Pierre Janet, and more recently
by Miss Clarissa Miles and Miss Hermione Ramsden. The result of
all these experiments, in Mr. Podmore's opinion, is to establish " the
affection of one mind by another at a distance, as a fact."
Thus the theory that some ghosts are to be regarded as telepathic
hallucinations is greatly strengthened. Moreover we find, as would
be expected on this hypothesis, other examples of hallucination, not
necessarily of human form, apparently produced by telepathic agency^
with examples of "experimental ghosts," that is to say, "fully
292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1910.
developed hallucinations of a human figure, produced by mental
suggestion."
"But if apparitions of the living may be inspired by the thoughts
of the living, may not apparitions of the dead be inspired by
thoughts of the dead 1 " Mr. Podmore admits that to this question
no certain answer can be given, but he shows that many phenomena,
which at first sight may suggest telepathy from the dead, prove on
further investigation explicable by telepathy from the living. E.g.
in several cases the percipient's impression coincides with the time
when the death became known to other living minds. " Mr. George
King, on December 2nd, 1874, dreamt of his brother being wrecked.
•On the following morning the newspapers contained an account of
the foundering of his brother's ship, which had taken place on
November 29th." At the time of Mr. King's dream "the founder-
ing of the ship would have been known at least in the printing
office and by the owners of the vessel."
With regard to haunted houses, Mr. Podmore suggests that in
most cases, " real sound.s, exaggerated and misinterpreted, induced
in nervous persons a state of uneasy expectancy, and this nervous
state in its turn gave rise to hallucinations." But there remain a
few instances which are difficult to explain thus and which suggest
rather some telepathic origin, and in these cases common sense points
to the source of the apparition in the thoughts of the living, whom
we know, rather than in the imagined thoughts of the unknown dead.
Nevertheless, Mr. Podmore concludes that " the investigation of
these phenomena is by no means complete, and though they should
prove to be wholly l)orn of earth, these ghosts of the living and
of the dead assuredly illustrate in a striking manner the mysterious
workings of the human mind and the unsuspected influence of soul
on soul. They are meteors which throw strange gleams of light
upon the structure of the cosmos of which they form a hitherto
neglected part." H. de G. V.

CASE.
L. 1179. Dream.
The followino- case of a dream which coincided with the
death of the person dreamt of was sent to us by Major-
General Carey, who carefully examined the witnesses and
obtained their statements.
The dreamer's account is as follows
30 Archers Road,
Southampton, April lith, 1910.
I, Charlotte Cox, am in the service of Miss Lydia Le Cocq,
who resides at No. 30 Archers Road, Southampton. (I have been
upwards of 38 years in her service and in that of her cousin, Mrs.
296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.
Laurence, who died in 1889.) My mistress being in poor health,
I am accustomed to sleep in her room.
On Sunday, 19th December, 1909, at about 7 a.m., I had a vivid
dream. I thought I saw an old friend of mine standing in the door-
way (half-open) between the bed-room and the landing. I said in
my dream, " 0 here is Susan." She appeared to be dressed in her
bonnet and mantle, looking quite natural, like herself as I recollect
her, though I had not seen her for some years. Miss Le Cocq, I
thought, turned round with a smile to welcome her, she being an
old acquaintance, having lived for upwards of 50 years in the familj',
with Dr. Le Cocq, Miss Le Cocq's uncle, and Mrs. Barnes, his
daughter, both now deceased. She had married a Mr. Thomas
Brailey about 20 years ago, being then upwards of 60 years of
age, and lived with him in Guernsey till his death about three years
ago, afterwards in Jersey.
The dream was a short one, and I awoke at about my usual
hour in the winter, 7 a.m.
I mentioned the fact of having had the dream that morning,
both to Miss Le Cocq, and also to my fellow-servant, Lilian
Allmeritter, who too has been 17 h years with Miss Le Cocq.
On the next evening, Monday, 20th December, 1909, I received a
notice from Messrs. Croad & Sons, Undertakers in Jersey (attached
hereto), dated 19th December, 1909 (Post-mark Jersey, 11.45 p.m.
Dec. 19, '09) to the effect that Mrs. Thomas Brailey had died on
that day at The Birches, St. Saviour's, Jersey.
A few days after I also received a letter from a friend in Jersey,
who mentioned the hour of the death, viz. 7 a.m. —thus coinciding
with the time when I awoke from my dream here. I was not
aware at that time of Mrs. Brailey being ill, nor had any reason
before my dream for being anxious about her. I had never dreamt
of her before, nor have I had any other experience of a similar
character at the time of the death of any other friend of mine.

April lith, 1910.
I am in Miss Le Cocq's service. I recollect Charlotte Cox, at
breakfast on the 19th December, 1909, telling me of her dream
about her old friend, Mrs. Brailey, as described above. The notice
from the Jersey undertakers came by post the next evening.

General Carey adds
22 Archers Road,
Southampton, April lifh, 1910.
I have this day seen Miss Le Cocq, who is a cousin of mine.
She corroborates Miss Cox's statement, and recollects quite well her
having told her about the dream on the morning of its occurrence,
and before the news of Mrs. Brailey's death arrived.
She gives Miss Cox the highest possible character as a thoroughly
veracious and reliable person and a most devoted servant to her.

in our possession and confirms the date of Mrs. Brailey's
death, as stated above.
TEICK-METHODS OF EUSAPIA PALLADINO
MAJOE AND MINOE
By Stanley L. Krebs.
[Dr. Krebs is an Associate of the Society who was formerly
an Associate of the American Branch. He has for many years
made a special study of the trick-methods used by fraudulent
mediums, and an article of his on the slate-writing of the
Misses Bangs, of Chicago, with an introductory note by Dr.
Hodgson, appeared in the Journal S.P.E. for January, 1901
(Vol. X., pp. 5-16). He writes to us that he was greatly
disappointed at the results of his sittings with Eusapia, which
were, we understand, held before the exposure advertised by
Professor Miinsterberg had become known. Ed.]
In round numbers there were a dozen guests present at both
the seances referred to in the following account, wliich were
held in Eoom 328, third floor, Lincoln Square Arcade, New
York, Dec. 1909 and Jan. 1910.
A rough board partition had been erected at the farthest
end of the room, in which was built the " Cabinet '
\^\th two
thin black curtains hanging from the top and falling loosely
down to the floor covering the entrance.
Against these curtains the back of the medium's chair was
298 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.
placed. In front of her was the table, a very small table
and light in weight; in fact it weighed only twelve pounds,
and was only a foot and a half wide and about a yard long,
made of plain, unpainted, pine boards. The gentlemen who
occupied the places of right and left " control " at various
times during the two s(^ances were Dr. Frederick T. Simpson,
hospital neurologist, of Hartford, Conn. ; Dr. Daniel Frohuian,
theatrical manager, of New York ; Mr. Lewis G. Mayer,
electrical engineer, of Philadelphia ; Mr. Frank Tilford, mer-
chant, of New York; Mr. Bradley, business man of Florida;
and myself. Dr. Leonard K. Hirshberg of Johns Hopkins
University requested to be placed in control, but Eusapia
failed to elect him—perhaps wisely from her standpoint.
Three others sat at the table, the other guests beintr distri-
buted around the room, mostly sitting close to the chairs or
the table-circle. A stenographer sat back taking notes at a
small table covered with a black cloth, her note paper being
illumined by a dim red electric bulb screened so that it could
not throw any light in any direction but upon her tablet.
[The general arrangement of the room and cabinet was as
described in the account by Mr. Dorr printed in the Journal
for April, pp. 267-272, but Mr. .Krebs adds that the sides
and back wall of tlie cabinet were painted black. The
phenomena were of the usual type.]
About half-an-hour after the sitting had commenced Dr.
Simpson took the place of Mr. Mayer as right-hand " control,"
and I remained in " control " on the left.
About eleven o'clock Dr. Hirshberg disturbed the seance
and caused a mild sensation by openly declaring that the
whole thing was a fraud and specifically charging that Eusapia
had a string attached to the flower-stand. The full light was
turned on and the stand examined ;
Eusapia took off her black
skirt and it was examined by me as well as her under white
skirt, stockings, and shoes ; but no trace of a string, or hook,
or any machine whatever was found.
About half an hour after this interruption I left my chair and
gave place to Mr. Bradley, who remained as left " control " the
balance of the evening. This change left me free to observe
the proceedings from various points nearer the table and
cabinet.
June, 1910. Trick-Methods of Eusapia Palladino. 299
The bulk of the phenomena consisted of the levitation of
the table, the " blowing out " of the curtain upon the table,
and the movements of the flower-stand.
The phenomena of tlie second seance were practically the
same as those of the first. One variation was that not only
were the feet of the medium tied to each " control's " chair,
but her wrists were also tied to their wrists. Twice the knot
on left " control's " wrist was untied by " John " (Eusapia's
spirit guide or control) and the rope thrown up upon the
seance table.
General Explanation of the Phenoviena.
I found substitution and thus liberation of hand or foot
going on all the evening, i.e. as long as I was in " control
—the only position in the circle in which this trick can be
discerned. Other experimenters have detected this, but only
on a few sporadic occasions ;
my claim is that this is the core
of the whole matter, and that Eusapia does it all the time,
and in several ways. I apply it to the whole performance,
and not only to occasional or fractional parts thereof.
I ibund, then, that the major secret of her phenomena is
a free hand, or a free foot, or both, employed simultaneously.
Her trick consists in skilfully freeing a hand or foot under
cover of (1) the table; (2) the curtains of the cabinet; (3)
her black dress; (4) the darkness of the room; (5) the
cabinet curtain when " blown out " and lying upon the seance
table.
These are the five blinds or screens which are necessary to
the seance, and cover up the movements of hand and foot.
When the light is lull and bright, and table tiltings and
raps are tlie only phenomena, then the table and her skirt
are the only blinds required, but they constitute quite good
and sufficient ones. The withdrawal of one foot and substi-
tution of part of the other for it, so that her one foot presses
upon both feet of the " controls " at the same instant, and a
similar manoeuvre with her hand, she has refined to an art.
No sitter who allows his mind to be dominated by " expectant
attention," diverted in the slightest degree to the "phenomena,"
or hypnotized by the wonder-feeling generally pervading the
atmosphere of the circle, will ever detect the nicety of these
300 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.
hand and foot movements unless she bungles them, which, of
course, sometimes happens. Hence she is sometimes detected
in them by those who sit in " control."
Two features at once aroused my suspicion :
(1) The extreme
narrowness of the table—only 18 inches wide; (2) the fact
that her feet were placed on ours instead of, as I had sup-
posed, ours on hers, and I determined to follow out to their
logical conclusion the clues thus thrust upon me. It flashed
over me instantly that this table had been made to oi'der ; its
unusual dimensions and small weight evidently designed for
some unusual purposes. I saw, for instance, at a glance that
its extreme narrowness would naturally bring the feet of the
two " controls " close together on the floor beneath it ; and
then I noticed finally that the feet of the table were all
square, with sharp or perfect edges, not rounded or bevelled.
Her feet being on those of the "controls," she controls them,
not they her. She not only wants to know, but must know
where their feet are in the darkness, so that they do not get
into her way or into dangerous places for her work. This is
the reason she keeps her feet in touch with the two " controls'
"
feet all the time. Her first shift towards freeing one foot or
the other is to move both feet down to the toes of both
" controls." I'rom this position either foot can be removed
and the other one made to cover both toes at once. It is
much better when the " controls' " feet pass each other side
by side—a position that often naturally follows, because the
table is so narrow ; in this position each " control " will feel
what seems to him the entire foot pressing his. This
manoeuvre is done quicker than it takes to describe it. She
frequently taps, pats or kicks with her foot. This motion
accustoms your foot to momentary absences of hers, and in one of
these momentary absences the other foot takes its place.
The control of hands follows two general plans: (1) When on
top of the table in sight, she will allow yours to rest upon hers.
(2) When under the table and on her lap out of sight, or
under the " blown out " curtain on the table top, hers grasps
yours or lies lightly on top of yours, and it is in this posi-
tion that she is enabled to loosen her hand grasp gradually
until only the fingers are lying flat on the back of your
hand ; the next move is to play furtively or restlessly on
jnxE, 1910. Trick- Methods of Eusapia Palladino. 301
your hand with the fingers of her left hand, when suddenly
the fingers of her right hand will take up this play with
the palm of it still resting upon the back of the opposite
" control's " ; thus she has her left hand free.
. This is all done skilfully, and much more rapidly than it
takes either to read or to write it. A free hand and a free
foot is the key that can unlock most of the performance that
she gives. I insist that it is much more essential for her to
keep tab on the " controls " than they on her, a fact which
explains why she is so careful and alert to keep in touch with
you. Several times I tried gradually and stealthily to release
my hand when under the table from hers in order to reach
out in the dark and grab her free arm ; but just as soon as
she detected this slight sliding of my hand away from hers
she pressed it all the harder.
I followed her in these hand and foot movements again and
again while I sat in left " control " ; I focussed my attention
there ; her slightest movement on my side I did not allow to
escape me ; and besides this I kept my eyes practically glued
to the leg of the table that stood between me and the medium.
That our two feet were close enough together to be covered
by one of hers I ascertained when Mr. M. was my opposite
" control " by simply moving my foot forward until it touched
his ; I had to move it less than an inch. When I did this
I felt her move her foot up upon my instep, i.e. back to its
original position. I made this little experiment towards the
middle of the seance.
That the " controls' " feet do, moreover, pass each other by
two or three inches and lie parallel I ascertained distinctly at
the second seance held January 10th. When the medium's
ankles were tied I was asked to get down and exa^mine same,
and report to the circle. When feeling around the medium's
ankle to see how the rope had been tied, I also felt both feet
of the two " controls," and found them side by side.
Change of " Control " and, the Instruction it afforded.
When Mr. M. left " control " and Dr. S. took his place, I
distinctly felt her left foot slide in and upon my right, while
the toe of her other foot was still on the toe of my right, i.e.
she failed to time the bringing back of her left foot and the
*
302 Journal of Society for Psychical ResearcJt. June, 1910.
taking away of her right, so that instead of being simul-
taneous, as intended by her, they followed each other momentarily,
thus distinctly proving to my sense of touch that the left foot
had been away somewhere and had now returned to its full
perch upon my right foot so as to have her right foot free to
place entire upon Dr. S.'s foot as soon as he should take his
seat. Had no change in the " controls " been made she would
not have been in such a hurry to get her foot back to the
" original position " for it, and her bungle (for such it was)
would then not have occurred.
This bungling, by the way, explains, I think, why she is
sometimes caught in her work and only sometimes ;
for, when
she is not fully alert or is perhaps scared by some sudden
action on the part of some one in the circle, she is naturally
in a hurry to get hand or foot back into proper place, and in
this hurry fails in the gradual approach or instant co-operation
which is necessary to truly artistic results. As a rule she has
full command of herself, because she has had immense practice
and is an artist in her line ;
consequently the slightest diversion
of the " controls' " attention is sufficient to enable her to accom-
plish the trick undetected, when instantly the "phenomenon"
happens, whereby attention is still more diverted from hand,
knee, and foot to the phenomenon.
At every seance it is officially announced that the backs of
Eusapias feet and hands are sensitive " extremely hyper-
aesthetic
"
—during the seance, ai^d for this reason the " controls
"
should not place their feet upon hers nor hold her hands with
their thumbs pressing the backs of hers, as such control is very
distasteful to her and makes her nervous.
On the subject of Eusapia's " hyperaesthesia " I must relate
an experiment I made later in the evening.
Mr. H., when standing behind my chair and close to the
cabinet in light 3 or 4, when the pale white of any one's
hands could still be seen, stuck his hand and arm into the
cabinet behind the curtain, which had been thrown out and
was lying upon the seance table. Instantly Madame Palladino
cried out as if in pain, whereupon Mr. Carrington explained
that she always does this when any one thrusts their hand
into the cabinet when the cabinet phenomena are taking place,
because the hand seems to pierce the vitality or substantial
June, 1910. Trick-Methods of Eusapia Palladino. 303
emanation, or whatever it is, wliich, he said, seems to flow from
Eusapia's body. So Mr. H. at once withdrew his hand. He
had put it into the cabinet to see if he could feel, catch, or
detect anything. But later in the evening, when Mr. B. was
in my place in " control " and I stood behind his chair
close up to the cabinet, I quietly slipped on a dark glove,
stuffed my cuff up under my black coat sleeve, and at least a
dozen times had my whole right hand and nearly all of my
arm in the cabinet, and yet not once did she cry out for pain
Why not ? Simply because she could not and did not see my
gloved hand enter the cabinet, while in the case of Mr. H.'s
ungloved hand she did. Her crying out in his case, therefore,
was all acting, which proves that she will turn tricks to produce
mental effects as well as physical ones. '
Phenomena Occdrking in Full Light. '
;
Tiltings of the TaUe. .
These are employed throughout the evening, and evidently
serve to keep up the interest of the circle and divert their
attention when preparations are making for a more startling
phenomenon.
Baps. -. • . ...s '
She tapped with her index finger nail on top of the table
in full light, both hands in full view. There were four faint
echoes, raps that imitated the rate and number of her finger
taps. The echoes were dull and sounded more like a distant
drum than a sharp, hard click such as her finger nail had made.
These echo-raps were made by gently thumping the heel
or toe of her free foot against the lower extremity of the
table leg. I not only distinctly felt the muscular contraction
and slight movement of her leg near the knee when she
did this, and also having my leg against the leg of the table
felt the four vibrations of the table leg, but further, looking
down around the corner of the table I saw the lower part
of the black skirt hit four times against the table leg.
Table Levitations. - . .
Dr. H., as stated above, departed early and left a sensation
behind, to settle which I was asked to examine the medium's
304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.
skirts, knee, leg, and shoe. When doing this my attention
was caught by the part of the shoe vamp at the heel. I
noticed that it was somewhat loose or projecting, as is often
the case, thus furnishing a splendid little shelf into which
the square edge of the table foot could snugly fit and upon
which it could get a perch of about a quarter of an inch.
All she had to do was to tilt the table and move her heel
slightly under the leg ; then she was ready for " levitations,"
partial or complete. I saw the table leg in exactly this
position to her foot with her black skirt between the table
foot and her shoe, thus hiding the presence of the latter.
I have tried again and again, and find that you can
produce a " complete levitation " with only one hand on
so light a table ; thus the other hand could be held in the
air above the table and clenched, as Eusapia often does, as
though " the force " was being thrown by this muscular effort
into the substance of the table—an occult discharge from
the one into the other
The free or fulcrum foot is in such a position that the
projecting edge of the sole of the shoe can also be used as
a little shelf for the sharp edge of the table foot.
I noted very easily that when the table was levitated
" on all fours," i.e. completely levitated, all four legs being
in the air at once, that it was never evenly levitated ; there
was always an angle of levitation, i.e. one corner was
always the highest and its diagonal opposite was the lowest.
In all the complete levitations the corners of the end
away from the medium were higher than the two corners
near her.
All these features will be clearly understood from the
simple fact that when the left foot is used as the fulcrum
it is under the near left leg of the table, the bottom of
that leg or rear edge of it resting on the vamp of the
shoe ; while her hands, resting flat on the table, or only
one hand, press upon it and so have sufficient friction to
pull so light a table backwards and diagonally to the left
which would have the effect of raising it highest at the far
end, with the right far corner higher than the left, the left
near leg being 2, 3, or 4 inches from the floor and resting
upon the heel vamp. To raise the table leg this high she
June, 1910. Trich-Methods of Eusapia Palladino. 305
draws her left free foot backward and up from the knee
as the immovable or radial centre, so that the " control " on
that side still feels her left knee pressing against his and her
right foot pressing upon his. When the table is levitated
with the right foot, the left far corner would naturally be the
highest point, and the right near corner the lowest.
Thus the phenomena as they actually happened are
explained, together with the fact that no levitation was
even, i.e. all four corners never rose to an equal height, say
12" or 15" from the floor.
I distinctly felt the slight muscular strain or movement
in her knee on my side at the moment when the levitation
occurred, as I sat at the left leg ; and twice I gently pushed
my leg closer and felt the calf of her left leg back of where
its true position would be if it were connected with the foot
I felt upon mine.
The above considerations show how the " controls " feel a
knee and a foot and think they belong to the same leg, when
they really belong to different legs.
No man could do the foot-substitution, simply because any one
looking under the table could see it ; but the skirt of a
woman hides it. Eusapia's skirt was not only over her foot
but also under the table foot ; hence when levitations occurred
the table foot seemed simply to be touching her dress in the
most natural way, though it really was grounded upon the
shoe vamp under her skirt.
Phenomena Occukking in Dim Light.
One thing had struck me from reading the published reports,
and that was that the left curtain was the one generally
" blown out." I therefore hovered around the left side of
the cabinet and made it the centre of my observations during
the evening ; and my experience agrees with the reports, for
it is a fact that the left curtain at these two seances was
thrown out far more frequently than the right.
Curtain BloiV7i Out.
While standing during the first seance close up to Mr. B.,
who was on the left " control," and close to the curtain as
306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.
well, whenever the light was dimmed (for that is the signal
that cabinet phenomena are about to come), I always focussed
my gaze into the cabinet through the crack between the loosely
hanging curtain and the partition. In a moment or two the
left curtain was " blown out " or thrown forward up upon the
table, where it remained.
When this happened I distinctly saw a pale white hand
and black sleeve back of it pushing or throwing out the curtain.
Whose hand and arm could this have been but Eusapia's ?
For the black arm that ran up from the swiftly moving pale
white thing that looked like a hand ran straight up towards
her shoulder.
Hovj she Finds Out tvhat is in the Cabinet.
It is sometimes stated that the articles are placed in the
cabinet before she enters the room, and that since she does not
pull the curtains aside or otlierwise look into the cabinet, she
cannot know what they are or where placed.
But all she has to do, and actually did at these stances,
is to " blow out " the curtain with a free arm and then simply
turn her head slightly to the side and look into the cabinet.
This was done in Light 2 and Light 3, when articles could
still be seen and their location easily discerned.
I saw her deliberately do this on the right and left sides
of the cabinet.
Moreover, it is significant in this connection that a metro-
nome which Dr. S. brought and placed far back in the
middle of the cabinet on the floor, against the partition, could
not be readily seen without turning her head completely around.
This metronome was not touched nor disturbed during the first
seance. But a letter from Dr. S., who was present at another
seance the very next night, tells me that on this night the
metronome was moved forward from the rear of the cabinet
by " John " and the pendulum of it disengaged. Why did
this happen the second night Dr. S. was there and not the
first night ?
Because on the first night she evidently did not know that
the metronome was there, nor what the metronome was, nor
what it was expected to do ; but after the first seance was
over Dr. S., I well remember, freely talked of what he had
June, 1910. Trick-AIethods of Etisapia Palladino. 307
hoped would happen to it aud where he had placed it in the
cabinet. So on the second night all this occurred.
Hand and Arm in Cabinet.
While moving my gloved hand around in the dark of the
cabinet on one occasion it suddenly came into contact with
Eusapia's arm there ; what I touched felt exactly like any
human arm. I knew it was hers for two reasons: (1) Mr. B.
had his arm lying on her lap with her right hand touching
it and covering the other " control's " too ;
stooping forward
as I was at that moment I could readily see this. (2) When
this touch occurred it naturally startled her and she moved
uneasily in her chair, turning and looking searchingly at me.
This action proved she had been touched. I said nothing
and appeared to be unconcerned, which relieved her fears,
and so she took B.'s hand in hers and moved both up and
down and around in the air to her left and his right, and
in front of the cabinet, by which manoeuvre she wished to
demonstrate to me that what I had touched in the cabinet
a moment before was that combination ! My keeping discreet
silence reassured her that I would not report anything to the
circle, and all she had to do then was to convince me alone,
which she sought to do by waving B.'s hand and hers around
in the air, imagining that I would infer that it was the same
hand I had touched just a moment before. But the arm I
had touched a moment before did not have hold of B.'s, because
his was quietly lying on her lap in the usual position of control.
I could not catch the arm I touched in the cabinet because
it was instantly withdrawn after our bump and in her
direction—which again is very significant—it did not melt
away in the cabinet, or go to " John " ! No, it drew back
towards her, and I saw it going.
Again, a dentist was standing near me in the second
seance, and when the flower-stand in the cabinet was moved
out and lifted bodily from the seance table, he too saw the
pale white hand grasping the leg of it and lifting it up. I
saw that hand, and saw, moreover, that an arm was attached
to it which ran straight up to Eusapia's shoulder, just as I
had seen it do before. In the second seance also the
mandolin passed through the air over Eusapia's left shoulder
308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.
and gently descended upon the seance table ; I was standing
to the left of the medium over near the cabinet and
distinctly saw her right hand under the blown-out curtain
holding the string end of the instrument and placing said
instrument upon the table covered by the curtain which was
still lying out upon it. To those sitting around the table and
in front this thing could not be seen, simply because it
was protected by the curtain. On seeing this, we both
instinctively moved forward to get a better view into the
cabinet and be ready for the next moving thing, which
I wanted to get close enough to to seize ; but this proximity
evidently made Eusapia nervous, for she ordered us to move
away from the cabinet and retreat farther back into the room.
Several times, while standing alone close to the cabinet
before D. came near me, I attempted to steal forward unobserved
in order to get close enough to scrutinize more carefully a
light object (size of a human hand) which I saw move from
the medium into the cabinet a moment or two before
several of the phenomena occurred there; but every time
Eusapia watched me closely, and at last commanded me,
through the interpreter, to stand away from the cabinet, on
the ground that my presence disturbed her " fluid."
Once she lifted her entire left leg and laid it prone on
both of my knees under the table, while I was in " control."
With this arrangement both feet were surely out of com-
mission, for Dr. S. felt her right foot firmly on his, while
both of us felt her hand on ours in her lap or on the table
top under the " blown-out " curtain. With this apparently
impregnable " control " the phenomena nevertheless continued.
But I noticed particularly that they were such as could be
produced by a free left hand, such as rappings or slight bumps
of the table at her end of it, table tiltings, movements of the
flower-stand, and touches of a hand on my side, which was the
left side of the medium. When the flower-stand had fallen to
the floor and was then slid across it, I saw the pale white
hand grasping its highest leg, and so distinctly that I also
saw that the thumb-side of the grasping hand was towards
me. This would be the only possible position in which Eusapia
could grasp it with her left hand.
The rope with which they tied her wrists later in the seance
June, 1910. Trick-Methods of Eusajna Palladino. 309'
was a clean, new, white rope, whiter than the skin of her
hands. Dr. G. tied it around the sleeve of her arm just above
her wrist ; she did not allow it to remain there, however, but
slid it down until it was free from above the sleeve, and then
pushed it back on the bare wrist until the black sleeve
covered it. She explained she did this for comfort, and it
seemed to be a very natural and non-signiticant action. But
in view of the fact that she needs her hand and arm for
reaching into the dark cabinet and moving things there, we
can readily see that so white an object as the rope around
the outside of a black sleeve would at once be seen and
recognized. It was therefore a neat and necessary precautionary
measure to cover the whiteness of the rope with the blackness
of the sleeve.
Tied with Bojyes.
At her own suggestion she was tied with ropes. Dr. G-.,.
who did the tying, wanted to tie both of her ankles together
but this she objected to. He was then instructed to tie
each wrist of hers to wrist of " controls," and each ankle
to chair of " control." This was done ; but each tie, according
to instructions, had to have at least twelve inches slack in it.
Besides this the interpreter stated that the " controls " were
instructed by Madame to yield to any pull or stress in
any direction and not to resist same. All this gave her as
much freedom of hand and foot movement as she had enjoyed
before this serious looking rope was applied.
K7wt Un tied.
At the second seance " John " untied the rope around the
wrist of the left "control." Dr. G. tied it again; the light
was dimmed, and again the " control " announced that the knot
was being untied, and soon it was thrown upon the seance
table. It seemed to be a striking act indeed.
I was standing behind and slightly to the right of the left
" control," and had stooped forward and to the right, which
brought my eyes in line with the end of the seance table
and a little below it. In this position I could see under the
curtain which was lying on the table, and all along the edge
of it over to the right " control " ; and this is what I saw : I
saw the medium's left hand covering both hands of " controls,'"
310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.
and her right arm passing under her left with her right hand
tugging away at the knot. From the position of the right
" control " (Mr. Frohnian) and curtain at that moment this
hand might have been seen also by him ; but it could not be
seen by the left " control " or by any one at the table or any
other part of the room, because the curtain covered " controls'
iands and hers.
The Mandolin.
The mandolin sounded twice, as though a finger were
furtively swept over it. But it was within easy reach of her
right hand, and it was easy to get that right hand free from
control.
Dynamometer and Mateh Box.
They were lying on the table, and were mysteriously dropped
by " John " into the left " control's " outside pocket, i.e., the
pocket nearest the medium. ,
•
To accomplish this neat trick all that she had to do was
(1) To throw the left curtain out upon the table partially
covering the dynamometer and totally covering the match box ;
and this was the way the curtain fell upon them. (2) With
her free left hand to reach under the curtain and secure the
dynamometer and match box, which was also done, for we saw
the dynamometer disappear under the curtain. (3) To drop
them, still in her left hand, into " control's " right-hand pocket.
As they lell they naturally made the click which all heard.
Pinch of a " Spirit " Hand.
I was pinched or squeezed on my right shoulder by a hand
that was clearly a hand ; I could distinctly feel fingers and
thumb. Prof. Miinsterberg thinks this touch can be made
by her free foot ; that she could lift her foot to that height
while seated on the chair and do it without the slightest
change in the position of her body. I hold that such a
gymnastic performance is utterly impossible. The " control
of tliat leg would at once detect the strain and stretch of
it and the withdrawal of her knee, which would be absolutely
necessary to reach the upper arm or shoulder. But even if
possible, how could a foot mimic the squeeze of a thumb
and fingers ? Tlie toes of the foot might press like the fingers
June, 1910. Trick-Methods of Eusapia Palladino. 311
of the hand ; but what on the foot could mimic the thumb
pressing in a direction opposite to the contracting fingers ?
No, it is impossible for her, thus seated, to produce so hand-
like a squeeze and at the height of one's shoulder. But how
ridiculously easy the squeeze becomes with a free left hand
under the blown-out curtain !
< . . The Toy Piano and Metronome.
All sitters have noticed the fact that as a rule only those
objects are moved which are within reach of the medium's
arms or feet.
However, there were two exceptions to this rule, namely,
the metronome, which was placed against the rear partition of
the cabinet on the floor, and the toy piano, which was also
on the floor against the left partition of the cabinet, and both
of these objects were so low and small that it was clearly
impossible to reach them unless she leaned very far over to
the side or backward, which she never did. Nevertheless, in
the first seance the toy piano was seen to come out directly
over her head, as it seemed to us, pushing the blown-out
curtain with it and gently falling upon or laying itself upon
the seance table. This was in Light 4. It was a striking
performance, for even if her left arm were free, how could she
reach the piano in the first place, and then move it directly
over her head ?
To answer the first question : The fiower-stand in the
cabinet is the instrument, I feel sure, which was used to
reach the toy piano and draw it nearer, within arm's reach.
Note this fact, I was appointed several times during the seance
to enter the cabinet and rearrange the contents after they
had been thrown into disorder by the frequent falling over of
the flower-stand, and in one of these excursions into the
cabinet I found that the stand had fallen over the toy piano
in such wise that the latter could easily have been drawn toward
the medium by pulling the stand. Prior to this particular
manifestation of the toy piano which we are now considering,
the flower-stand fell over in the cabinet. Then there was
silence ; then all of us heard something slowly sliding over the
floor of the cabinet as if something was sneaking around in
there : we watched, but nothing appeared from the cabinet as
312 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.
we momentarily expected it to do ; instead some other things
happened—some tiltings of the table, and the dynamometer
and match box incident—which attracted or distracted our
attention, and just when we were not expecting it, lo ! the toy
piano pushed out and landed on the seance table.
This flower-stand, which figures so prominently in the
seances, is an innocent-looking, frail affair. But its three legs
crossing form a clever hook at the top end to "scoop" in
things lying on the floor, and the legs are good handles to
grasp easily ; for you can let it fall in any direction it may,
and one leg is always up in the air, while the clear space at
the top end between the two legs and the top is a splendid
arrangement in which to bag objects beyond arm-reach. A
four-legged stand would have to be cross-stayed, which would
surely prevent as thorough and sure a hold on objects as the
three-legged arrangement provides.
I think, therefore, she could get the metronome at another
seance by pushing the flower-stand to fall back over it ; the
top of the stand would thus catch the metronome, and she
could draw it slowly forward within reach, just as she
evidently did with the toy piano.
But even if the toy piano was brought within reach by the
flower-stand, how could she lift it directly over her head from
rear to front ?
Mr. B. was standing behind the right " control," Mr. H.
and I behind the left " control." To one standing at the
side, as we were located, the toy piano appeared to come out
directly over her head ; but I found afterwards this was a
case of mal-observation, for the stenographer, who saw it from
directly in front, and could therefore see the exact relation
it had to the medium, reported it as coming out over her
left shoulder, as high as the top of her head,—a movement
which is not at all difficult to execute. So one can see how
easy it was for her to bring out the toy piano with her
free left hand under the blown-out curtain and gently place
it upon the table, all in very dim light, too.
Dr. S.'s Chair is Moved.
Dr. S.'s chair was twice pulled, with him sitting in it, of

one woman to pull without giving open signs of muscular
effort. Is there an explanation ? In answering this, I have
three points to make: (1) It happened on the side of the
table opposite to where I sat ; nevertheless all could dis-
tinctly see that the slide of an inch or two (not more)
which the chair made was in the direction of the medium.
This was very evident and also very significant. (2) It
happened twice. After it had happened once " John " was asked
to do it again. Upon this request I focussed my whole
attention on the foot and knee of the medium on my side
(for at this time I was still in " control ") and found that,
when the phenomenon was repeated, there was a distinct
pressure of her foot on mine and slight muscular movement
of knee, with slight increase of pressure against my knee.
All these circumstances made me think that with her free
right hand (the left still covering both " controls ") she
pulled the chair, and at the same instant braced herself with
her feet and knees so as to keep her body stationary or
immovable. (3) On practising this afterwards with a man as
heavy as, if not heavier than, our slender Dr. S., I found, to my
surprise, that it requires but a slight, somewhat sudden, mus-
cular contraction of the arm to draw the chair towards you an
inch or two.
Her Trance State.
She occasionally yawns and hiccoughs. These signs, we are
told, herald or accompany the oncoming of the trance state.
If she is really in a trance, how can she be asking the
interpreter all the time what the sitters are saying whenever
they say anything ? If any one makes a serious remark, she
at once asks to have the interpreter explain it to her. (She
does this, in my judgment, to get cues as to which point or
in which direction their suspicions may be tending, and to
govern herself and the phenomena accordingly.) How could
she be entranced, and at the same time keep so firm a hand
on all these questions and mental currents of the circle ?
A dentist and I were standing right back of left " control
near the cabinet ;
Eusapia, through the interpreter, asked us
to step away and not stand so close. We obeyed, and noted
that the phenomena came faster then.
314 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, i9io.
She is Argus-eyed, glancing here and there alertly, evidently
to find out where people are standing and what doing. If in
real trance she would not know or care where they were.
I do not believe that Eusapia Palladino was in any kind of
trance at any moment of these two " successful " seances.
Several times she objected to the very dim light and
ordered more turned on. This seemed to be in her favour.
But it really works the other way in my judgment ;
for, if
I were in her place, I too would not want the light so low
that I could not see where people were, for some one might
approach the cabinet unobserved by me, and there do infinite
mischief.
Does any one ask why, when I detected her in these
substitutions and movements, I did not then and there expose
the facts? For two reasons: (1) Item 4 in the "Notes to
Sitters," the printed and formal instructions which Mr. Car-
rington mails to all who engage seats, reads as follows :
" It is
very important to remember that, whatever the attitude of the
sitter toward the Medium may be, no suspicion be openly
manifested at the sittings, as this is liable to spoil the
phenomena." I obeyed this rule. Of all things I did not
want the phenomena spoiled ; on the contrary, I wished them
to be produced and multiplied in as great numbers as possible
in the time allotted to the seance. (2) I wanted her to have
her own way unmolested. I was there to observe, not to
obtrude ; to discover, and not to dictate. She was the per-
former, and I simply part of the audience.
Eusapia claims that she is anxious to allow sitters,
especially the sceptical ones, to examine everything and do
anything they please to satisfy themselves. Not only the
writer, but many others besides, can bear positive evidence
to the unquestionable fact that she does not allow any
such absolute freedom. She positively refused to let me have
my foot on hers and my hand hold hers ; she positively
refused to have her ankles tied together ; she positively
refused to allow me to stand as close to the cabinet as I
wanted to, etc., etc. Note carefully : she refused at the
very points I found to be the vital points ;
on the non-
vital points, such as examining the table, the cabinet, the
flower-stand, etc., she is liberal enough.
June, 1910. Triclc-Methods of Eusapia Palladino. 315
Mr. reilding says :
" She keeps her hand on top of the
'r controls' ' and moves them restlessly about." This restless
motion gets the controls accustomed to the motion, which,
as I found again and again, is her preparation for hand
substitution.
" Her right foot on mine is kicking about." This is what;
I mean by the tapping of the foot or working of it on the
control's. By this means they get accustomed to the
momentary absence of the medium's foot, and in that
momentary absence the other foot is substituted, they think-
ing, however, all the time, that it is the same one she had
started out with.
Dr. Morselli conducted a series of seances with Eusapia
at Genoa that were far more successful than the series
conducted at Milan. Dr. Morselli noticed that muscular
contractions made by the medium synchronized with the
appearance of the phenomena. " We have almost always
noticed," the report says, " this isochronism between the
phenpmena and the gestures of the medium ; the effort of the
medium is produced on these occasions on the opposite side
to that on which the phenomena are produced."
These two facts may be explained by the hypothesis of ^
a free hand or free foot on one side, while the other hand
and other foot are pressing upon the " controls','' for thus the
muscular contractions would be felt on one side, while the \
phenomena would be produced on the other.
It is a curious thing, to my mind, that we all had to learn
Italian enough to say " Bene," " Controlo Bene," " Molto
Bene" ("good," "control good," "very good"). We said
this to encourage the medium. We had only a few minutes
to learn this, while the medium has been with English people
often. It is said she is an illiterate woman, but she is quite
bright, and should have been able to learn some English words
in all this time. Mr. Feilding writes :
" We have always
been extremely suspicious of a substitution of feet being
performed. During this seance Carrington did notice a change,
and he stooped down to feel, and found that Eusapia had
crossed her feet. He told me in English that the foot control
was not good. Eusapia, who is always annoyed when she
does not know what is being said, was furious. She worked
316 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, i9io.
herself up into a passion and covered us with rich Neapolitan
reproaches for our suspicion. The storm raged for about an
hour."
.
Here she seemed to understand English perfectly well.
Conclusions.
(1) She uses no confederate.
(2) All the phenomena are produced in a space or area
that is within reach of the arm and leg of the medium, still
further lengthened by the use of a flower-stand as a " reacher,"
and a shoe edge as a fulcrum for levitations.
(3) Personally I do not believe Eusapia Palladino has any
extraordinary psychic or telekinetic power. Her whole per-
formance seems to me, on the basis of what I saw and felt,
to be the deception of two senses, sight and touch, assisted by
intentional suggestions.
Instruments of precision from the scientific laboratory are
not needed here. The problem, in my judgment, lies in quite
a different and far simpler field—that of clever detection.
From my experience of these two sittings, I would make the
following suggestions to future investigators
(1) The medium was always dressed in a black dress. If
she were dressed in white her whereabouts and movements
could easily be seen in the dark room. This would be the
simplest test of all, and I therefore place it first.
The cabinet was painted black on the inside. The table
which " John " moved so frequently was made of plain unpainted
pine boards ;
why then had the cabinet to be painted, and
painted black ? The answer is simple, namely : to render
the sleeves of her black dress unseen when she thrust her
arm inside. And another thing may be explained by this
black sleeve and black background, namely, that it isolates
her hand for the sense of sight, so that sitters, seeing a
pale white hand in the cabinet, will exclaim: "I see a hand
unattached ;
just a hand ; no arm with it." If she wore a
white dress this illusion of sight could not take place.
(2) Another simple precaution would be to place the
medium at the broad side of the table and have only one.
person in control of both her hands and both her feet at one
and the same time.
June, 1910. Trick-Methods of Euscqna Pcdladino. Sit
(3) I would also suggest a square table, each side of which
is at least three feet in length. This width would compel the
" controls " to sit so far apart that their feet could not be
pressed simultaneously by only one foot of the medium
and she should then keep her hands on the table top in
full view.
(4) Since she asks to be tied, her two ankles should be
tied together with a slack of only four or five inches—nob
more—and her two wrists together with a similar slack.
(5) But if she will allow none of these test conditions,
then I would advise the sitter who desires to verify my
observations for himself to secure the place of left " control,"
since that appeai-s to be the more active side. He will then
have more numerous opportunities of detecting the various
movements here described.
DISCUSSION OF THE SECOND REPORT ON MRS.
HOLLAND'S SCRIPT.
It is always easier to believe in spirits than in any known cause,
because, knowing nothing about spirits, we are justified in crediting
them with omnipotence, whereas in advocating a known cause,
even a cause so imperfectly investigated as telepathy, our very
knowledge of the subject reveals difficulties and objections.
Any explanation on telepathic lines of the remarkable series of
correspondences in the " Sevens " case ^ must obviously leave gaps, and
offer numerous points of attack. Let that l)e admitted. But it is
hardly necessary to point out that the case points primarily to
telepathy as the explanation. Moreover, it invalidates by anticipation
the evidence to which we have all been looking as almost crucial
the evidence to be derived from a posthumous letter. Personally I
have always recognised that the explanation by telepathy from the
living was not wholly precluded in such a case, but if a posthumous
letter had actually been I'ead, I should certainly have felt that the
evidence for the action of the dead had been enormously strength-
ened. Obviously, one can feel that no longer. The possibilities of
leakage so clearly demonstrated in this case have practically shattered
all our hopes of obtaining evidence in that direction.
iSee Proceedings, Part LX. pp. 222-263.
I
318 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, i9io.
But the explanation of telepathy from the living presents, as said,
difficulties. Let us attempt to trace out the possible outlines of the
process. Mr. Piddington ever since July 13th, 1904, has been mentally
whispering "Seven" and "Seventy times seven" to all the world.
Now we know from the "Steeple" incident {Proc. Vol. XXII.
p. 38) that Mr. Piddington has influenced Mrs. Piper telepathically.
From Mrs. Verrall's script, written also on July ISth, 1904, he
appears also to have influenced Mrs. Verrall. (Note, as bearing upon
the hypothesis of communication from the dead, that this same
script, which gave true information about the contents of a living
mind, gave false information, and that in the most emphatic terms,
aliout the contents of a mind no longer living. Miss Johnson
suggests (Part LX. p. 257) that the true information may have
come from the [disembodied] intelligence which planned the whole
scheme from the other side. What, then, was the source of the
false information given in the same piece of writing 1)
There is no direct evidence that Mr. Piddington influenced the
mind of any other contributor to the cross-correspondence. Indeed,
from the fact that all the correspondence occurred in the space of
three months, nearly four years after the posthumous letter was
written, it seems clear that something else was needed. That some-
thing else was no doubt Mrs. Verrall's influence. The idea of
Seven, latent probably in Mrs. Verrall's mind for years, seems to
have taken definite shape on the occasion of her reading Dante,
and to have been thence transferred, in close alliance with Dantesque
imagery, to the other automatists. This explanation does not pre-
clude the possibility that Mr. Piddington directly influenced the
minds of all the automatists. If he did so, it would appear that
his influence was not sufficient, until reinforced by that of Mrs.
Verrall, to arouse any mental image.
Now let us suppose a double stream of telepathic influence acting
on the minds of the five other automatists, and tending to produce
the idea of Seven, allied with images from the Divine Comedy. It
seems to me probable that the automatic association of ideas would
produce results such as we find recorded. The telepathic influence
is not quite strong enough in most cases to make the ideas come
to the surface of themselves. The imported image can only make
itself visible when reinforced by its connection with images momen-
tarily passing through the mind. Thus Mrs. Piper has some
mediaeval Latin doggerel read to her, and selects from it the words
"angel band," because Mrs. Verrall has for some days past been
trying to say " angel band " to her.
In Miss Verrall's case the procedure appears to have been more
complex. The idea of Seven is here much more conspicuous than
the Dante imagery. The idea of Seven calls up primarily images from
botany and from the book of Revelation. But these are fixed, it
may be, because they happen to coincide with Dante images. But
the Dante influence does not seem to me predominant. The attempt
to connect [d) and (b) with Dante seems far-fetched.
Mrs. Home was apparently inaccessible to the Dante influence, and
June, 1910. Second Report on Mrs. HullancVs ScrijJt. 319
the allusions to Dante in Mrs. Holland's script are very dubious. The
idea of the posthumous letter in these two cases would here seem
to be reproduced unalloyed, but the time-coincidence points to the
conclusion that even here Mr. Piddington's influence could jiroduce
no eft'ect until reinforced by Mrs. Verrall's. Mrs. Piper's "tick, lick,
tick," would also point to Mr. Piddington's influence. Here, again,
we may suppose that Longfellow's poem passed through the mind
by natural association of ideas, and was arrested in its passage by the
previous faintly impressed image of tick. But the coincidence hei'e
may be puiely fanciful.
In conclusion, may I briefly recall some experiments which present
certain parallel features to the cross-correspondences. In 1884 Prof.
Richet conducted some experiments as follows : At a table were seated
three mediums or automatists—-persons under whose unconscious
muscular action the table would tilt. Behind their backs, at a second
table, was seated an operator, who incessantly let his pencil travel
backwards and forwards along a printed alphabet. The alphabet
was further concealed by a screen from the meiliums. When the
table tilted a bell rang, and the letter imlicated by the pencil at
that moment was recorded. M. Richet him-^elf thought of a word,
or looked at a line in the dictionary—and the word would be
spelt out, letter by letter.
In this experiment we have to assume a double telepathic action
of some kind. The simplest explanation is that the "mediums"
were influenced both by Richet and by the "operator." Alternatively,
the operator may have received Richet's thought telepathically, and
have telepathically influenced the mediums to tilt. The experiments
are quoted in Froc. Vol. II. pp. 247 seq. On either explanation we
find here a rudimentary form of the more complex process which
appears to be demonstrated in the recent cioss-correspondences.
I will take the present opportunity to discuss another point. Miss
Johnson, in criticising my account of the Latin Message incident,
repeats a claim originally made by Mr. Piddington. " Mr. Podmore,"
she says, "has omitted to take into account the important fact that
though the Piper-Myers failed to show any real comprehension in
the abstract of the plan of cross-correspondences, he pointed out
and maintained his point in the face of every discouragement—that
'
Browning, Hope and Star '
was an instance of tha kind required."
In my original criticism (published in the Contemporary Review for
September last) I designedly omitted any reference to this point,
because I thought that it was not substantiated. Let us see how the
case stands.
" Browning, Hope and Star " is a brief description of an extremely
complex, allusive, and enigmatic cross-correspondence in which Mrs.
Piper, Mrs. Verrall and Miss Verrall all took part. The relative
scripts were written in the period between January "iSrd and February
17th, 1907,—that is, shortly after the Latin message had been dictated.
The first attempt at translation of that message took place on February
20th. In the interval, on February 11th, though not in any connection
with the Latin message, the Piper-Myers spontaneously referred to
320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.
Evangelical, Browning, Hope and Star. Immediately after the second
reference to the three words last quoted, Mr. Piddington, in taking
leave of the control, asked him to reply to the Latin message at
the next sitting {Proc. Vol. XXII. pp. 320-1).
In the course of the next few days Mr. Piddington read the
scripts of Mrs. and Miss Verrall, in which the cross-correspondence
"Hope, Star and Browning" occurred, and, in his own words, before
February 20th " I had become impressed, I may even say obsessed,
with the idea that Mrs. Verrall's script of January 28—which had
on February 11 been described in the trance by the Piper-Myers as
'
Hope Star and Browning '
—-was an attempt by the Verrall-Myers
to give, by means of indirect allusions to Stanza Vil. of Aht Vogler,
an intelligent answer to the Latin message" (p. 330).
Note Mr. Piddington's very candid account of the state of mind
in which he appioached the seances of February 20th and subse-
quent dates.
On February 20th there occurred the first attempt at translation.
On February 27th occurred two other attempts. In the interval
between these two later attempts the control remarked " I believe . .
I have sufficiently replied to your various questions to convince the
ordinary scientific mind . .
." Mr. Piddington, referring to this
statement, said later in the stance to the control :
" You say you
have replied—tell me in what messages your reply is given." The
control, in answer, refers successively to "the poems," "halcyon
days," "evangelic," "shrub," "syringa," "the poems and cross-
correspoTiding messages." Mr. Piddington then asks, " What poems 1
The control replies, " My own. Browning. Horace." At the con-
trol's request Mr. Piddington repeats this last utterance, and the
control continues: "Yes; chiefly Browning's lines as given through
Mrs. Verrall and another.
'
Mr. Piddington then told the control :
" I want to say that
you have, I believe, given an answer worthy of your intelligence,
—not to-day, I mean, but some time back—but the interpretation
must not be mine. You must explain your answer [through Mrs.
Piper]. . . . You could do it in two woids."
-
The control replies, "Hope, Star." Mr. PidcUmjton, "Well? YesT'
The control—" Browning." Mr. Piddington then tells the control :
"In telling me that 'Browning, Hope, and a Star,' contains your
answer to the Latin Message you have given an answer which to
me is both intelligible and clear."
It is hardly necessary to say that after this last explicit statement
from Mr. Piddington no later reference to the connection of the
Latin Message with "Hope, Star and Browning" could possess
much evidential value. But in fact it does not appear that, despite
the strong hint given, the trance intelligence did advance much
further in connecting the two ideas.
It is then on the conversation above summarised that Mr. Piddington
has based his contention that the control showed a comprehension
of the purport of the Latin Message. And presumably Miss
Johnson relies upon the same incident to support her statement
June, 1910. Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Scrijjt. 321
that the Piper-Myers "pointed out, and maintained his point in
the face of every discouragement, that 'Browning, Hope and Star'
was an instance of the kind required."
In my view we should not even be justified in regarding the
connection—casual and insignificant as the connection seems to be
—of the Latin Message with "Hope, Star and Browning" as having
been effected spontaneously by the trance intelligence. The control
suggests several things : Mr. Piddington, on its repetition, selects
the word poems, and asks "What poems'?" The control names three
poets and asks Mr. Piddington to repeat the sentence after him.
After listening to Mr. Piddington, the control selects Browning.
But Browning had already been connected with Hope and Star at
a previous seance. The evidence, as it stands, would certainly not
be accepted in a telepathic experiment.
Frank Podmore.
EXPEPJMENTS IN CEYSTAL VISION AND
HYPNOTISM.
The following accounts by the Kev. H. E. of experiments in
hypnotism were sent to us by Mr. F. C. Constable. The
first experiment is similar to those recorded by Mr. H. E. in
the Journcd for November, 1908, and November, 1909.
No. 7.
February =l\st, 1910.
April 11, 1909. F. B. and E. E. P. F. B. had been describing
a dream. A public house called the Milkman's Arms, and a slate
with the drawing of a cow on it, formed part of this dream. On
the table was a cycling map, and F. B., having finished the above
description, read from the cover of the map a list of names of places
for which other maps of a like kind were prepared.
I gave the crystal to E. E. P. He held it up to his eye, and
looked at the lamp through it. I have never seen him use the
crystal like this before. He then began to describe a shop where
milk and butter were sold. It had marble slabs on the counter and
ferns in the window. A man with reddish wdiiskers was behind
the counter. Outside, it was a stjirlight night, and there were large
electric lamps in the street. The shop was situated in the fork of
a road. E. E. P. was able to read the name over the shop indis-
tinctly, and thought it seemed to be Newman. He could not
remember ever having seen the shoji, and declared he did not
know where it was.
On being hypnotised, he state4 in reply to my question, "Where
was the shop you just saw in tlie crystal?" "At Newbury; I slept
there with my brother W. when we cycled through it, about seven
322 Jourmd of Society for Psychical Researcli. June, 1910.
years ago." Asked why he saw the picture, he replied that F. B.
had mentioned Newmarket when reading out the names on the
map-cover. "What had that to do with it?" "There was a
race-course there ;
they were making a new one and I went to see
it." Further questioned about the shop, he said he thought of
the milk-shop when F. B. was describing his dream about the cow
drawn on the slate. There was a white china cow in the window
of the shop. He did not know the name of the shop at all. Was
pressed hard on this point, but kept to his statement that he did
not know it. He did not say "did not remember" it.
The chain of thought seems to start with the name Newmarket.
This suggests racing. This suggests the racecourse at Newbury.
Also the description of the cow on the slate suggested the cow in
the window. Doubtless the name Milkman's Arms also helped. It
is curious to note how many of F. B.'s random remarks by chance
fitted in with a previous experience of E. E. P.'s, and suggested the
crystal picture. This experiment differs from others inasmuch
as the cr3'stal gave the name (indistinctly and uncertainly) of the
shop, ami yet E. E. P. could not recall it in his hypnotic state at
all. He also professed entire ignorance of the name of the shop
in his waking state.
E. E. P. has only this once been to Newbury, arriving late in
the evening " when the stars were out," and leaving the next
morning after seeing the race-course. H. E.
The following is a simple ease of the exaltation of memory
under hypnotism, the impression which then emerged having
been apparently limited to the subliminal consciousness when
it first occurred.
February lOth, 1910.
I once gave a subject, while awake, a cedar pencil which I took
from my pocket. He was to make some calculations for me, pre-
viously to being hypnotised, and he nsed the pencil for about 5
minutes or so. After he had been hypnotised and had completed
the experiment in which I was engaged, I asked him suddenly
the name, etc., of the maker of the pencil. He gave it me at once,
and knew the number of the paiticular make, which was stamped
in the usual gold letters and figures, together with the name of
the manufacturer. Afterwards, wiien he was awake, I offered him
5s. if he would give me these details, but he was quite unable to,
adding that he had never troubled to look at the pencil. Now he
had looked at the pencil, and he had taken in all these details,
probably at a glance, —but he was quite unconscious of the fact.
It may be argued that he read my mind. But this will not help
much, as [in that case] I must equally unconsciously have learnt
these details and stored them, for ,1 did not know in the least the
words or numbers on the pencil, and should be quite ready to
declare I had never seen them. ' H. E.

The following are experiments in the timing of dreams
that occurred in the hypnotic state.
March Idth, 1910.
W. R S. A stoker in Royal Navy, aged 27. An exceptionally
strong subject, mentally and physically. He goes into a deep
hypnotic sleep, if allowed to, —so deep that it is difficult to get
any answers to questions. While in this profound trance, he dreams.
On waking, he remembers these dreams which he says are the
same as ordinary dreams. He is not subject to dreams in normal
sleep and has them but rarely. I suggested, while W. R. S. was
in hypnosis, but before I let him go into the profound sleep, that
if a dream occurred, he should give a "grunt" and another when
it ended. I took the time by the second-hand of my watch that
elapsed between the two signals. The following dreams occurred :
(1) March 11, 1910. Sitting in No. 3 mess H.iMS. playing
whist. Has for partner F. C. and as opponents S. and B. Plays
three hands and wins. Was playing for beefsteak and (tin) peas.
At end of game W. R. S. goes to galley and cooks steak ; dream
ended while cooking. Brought back from deep sleep to a lighter
one, and asked how long the dream he had just had, had lasted,
he replied "about half an hour." I then awaked W. R. S. and
asked him if he had had a dream while asleep, to which he replied
by relating the dream, as above. He said it was vivid and clear,
and seemed very natural. Asked how long it lasted, he again said,
"about half an hour. I was able to play the three hands right
through, and nearly finish cooking the steak." Actual time, 10
seconds.
(2) March 16, 1910. W. R. S. dreams: Gets on cycle at H
to ride home. Almost directly, a child runs into him, and he comes
off. No one hurt. Starts again, and just before getting home,
again runs into children playing marbles in the road, who won't
move for him. He kicks at one as he rides past.
After waking he says this really happened a day or two before.
That the dream seemed to take about 20 minutes. That he could
never see anything clearly, —all seemed dark. He was conscious
of the handle-bars of the cycle, but nothing else. He knows he
can ride this journey in 20 minutes. Actual time, 25 seconds.
(3) March 17, 1910. Dr. C present. W. R. S. dreams:
At No. 16 boiler in H.M.S. S. is drawing fire. Stoker B.
is damping down. W. R. S. thinks he is standing behind B. S.
faints from the great heat and falls forward over handle of rake.
Burns right hand badly by falling on hot cinders. W. R. S. picks
him up and takes him to next stokehold and sends man with him
to sick bay.
W. R. S. after awaking says he was dreaming 15 or 20 minutes.
Time between the two signals given by himself was slightly under
15 seconds.
324 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.
Azotes.
In dream (2) W. R. S. has a repetition in sleep of an event exactly
as it occurred in all details. The dream differed from Nos. (1) and
(3) in not being clear and vivid. "He was always in darkness."
" He could feel the cycle going, but could see nothing hut the
handle-bars." "He saw nothinaf of the road," etc.
In dreams (1) and (3) we get scenes manufactured out of various
[actual] events. In (1), for instance, the card game [which had
actually been] played for the supper was not whist, and it was
a " drive," in which many more than four players took part. Also,
W. R. S. has never [really] played whist at any time with S. and
B , —they would be a class of person he would not play with. But
he has often played with F. C, who he dreamt was his partner.
In [the actual event on which] dream (3) [was based], W. R. S.
did not pick up the fainting man, as he could not get at him,
the fire being between them, but Stoker C, who was not in the
dream at all, took the man away.
The cause of dream (3) is interesting. I had asked Dr. C. to
be present to test the dream-timing, as it seemed a new experiment.
We had been getting" a number of crystal visions from W. R. S.,
and one of them we had dwelt on for some time. This was the
vision of a railway station and a man lying on the platform with
a crowd round him, and it had occurred nine days previously. I
had not asked him afterwards, while in hypnosis, what it meant, and
he could not give any account of it in his normal state. As this
picture came again, I sent W. R. S. to sleep and asked for an
explanation. He said it was Pl3'mouth N. Road station, and at
Easter, 1902, when there, starting for his leave, a man had a
fit on the platform just as the train came in. The man was put
into the train, and he got out at Exeter. Both on March 8th and
again on tliis occasion, W. R. S. said, while looking at the crystal,
a G. W. Railway station, for I can see G. W. R. and number 275
"it looks like Exeter station." On March 8th, he added, "it is
on a porter." This man in a fit probably suggested the drean,i

CASE.
L 1180. Dream.
The following account has been communicated to us by General
Sir E. H., who, while informing us of the full names of all
the persons concerned, requested us to print their initials only.
He gives a preliminary statement of the circumstances, as
follows
In order to understand the dream, I should mention that my
elder brother some years ago took on an additional surname, so
that from General H. he changed to General H.-S. I am
correctly referred to as General H., or Sir R.
My brother decided to have a slight operation, and the doctors
and surgeons considered there was no risk. The operation took
place in a Nursing Home in London on April the 25th [1910],
and was considered a success. On the 26th he was found to be
suffering severely from shock, but this nearly all passed away on
the 27th. On the 28th he was not so well, and by night time
the case was very serious. On the morning of the 29th the
doctors decided that the only hope lay in sleep. Morphia was
given every 4 hours. Before the first injection, about 7 a.m.,
he was quite collected and calm, and agreed to sleep. His son, R.,
had been with him all the time, and his daughter, B., arrived in the
early morning, and she exchanged a few words with her father. For
the rest of the day he was drowsj' under morphia. About 6.30 p.m.
he began to collapse, and breathed his last at 7 p.m., in the presence
of his son and daughter and the doctors.
Before the operation he was in excellent health, and very
strong for his age, 66.
Miss F. [the dreamer] met my brother once, a year or two ago.
She had met his daughter some years ago, and she met his son
on the 13th April last for the first and only time, and she knew
slightly one of my sons, who received a telegram from his cousin
at about 8 p.m. on the 29th, announcing the death. I have ascertained
that not one of these three persons had given a thought to Miss F.,
and it would have been strange if they had.
At my request the lady referred to by Miss F. has signed as
correct the statement made to her on Aj^ril 30th.
Miss F. is devoted to my wife and myself; she saw us and our
daughter off from Victoria Station for the Continent on April
16th; and just in fun I gave her our accident insurance tickets
328 Journal of Society for Psychical ResearcJi. July, wio.
for the journey, requesting her to hand them over to my son in
case of a tragedy. Before she had heard of my brother's death,
she wrote to my wife and said she was anxious to hear news of
us, as we had promised to send a postcard on arrival, and she
made some joking reference to the insurance tickets, but no
mention of the dream she had had. We do not remember having
promised to send the postcard. Miss F. is middle-aged, absolutely
reliable, clever, very exact and methodical.
It will be observed that Miss F. dreamed of my brother's death
a few hours afterwards, on the night of April 29-30, but she did
not know of his death till the night of May 7th.
At about 6 p.m. on April 30th I received at Aix-les-Bains a
telegram from my son to say my brother had died on the 29th.

An Ac'fiount of my Dream of the niglit of A pril 29th-30th
In mW dream I somehow became aware of the fact, "General
H. is c^ad." There was a slight hesitation after H., as if an
instrun^nt at work had gone wrong, and made a hissing sound.
There did not seem any one about to explain, but I queried in
my owji mind, "If they mean Sir R., why is his title omitted?"
AgainJ;'the fact was repeated, and again with the slight hesita-
tion, ^nd the sound of an " s," as in hissing, and that and the
omiss&n »made me feel (in my dream) that there was something
inaocfer^te about it, though I felt convinced it had to do with
Sir jL's family, and that it was because I knew him the informa-
tioET J^as given to me. The next morning (Saturday, April 30th)
ab'ou^ 11 a.m. I met a friend, to whom I told my dream, and I
said/"I do wish I could hear from Aix, as I know my dream has
something to do with Sir R. ; he is mixed up in it somehow, I am
quite sure." So as I was anxious, I despatched a letter to Lady H.
But neither asleep nor aM'ake did I once think of the H.-S.'s.

A. H. C.
On receiving this account Sir 11. H. sent a number of questions
to Miss F., the answers to which she embodied in a second
version, written on May 19th, 1910. The first part of this
JULT, 1910. Case. 329
is an almost verbatim repetition of what she had written before
she then adds :
About 11 a.m., Saturday, April 30th, I met a friend in the
Edgvvare Road, to whom I told my dream, and stated my
anxiety in consequence of it, adding " I wish Lady H. had
sent me a line, as she kindly promised to do when we parted a
fortnight previously." My friend. Miss C, remarked, "But
Sir R. did not go abroad ill." "No," I replied, "but a good
deal can liappen in a fortnight ; all three of them could be dead
and buried in that time ; however, do not go away with the idea
that it is Sir R., for I am sure it is not, as there was no title,
though at the same time I know he is mixed up in it, so I wish
they would write."
Being still anxious, I wrote to Lady H., either that night or
Sunday afternoon, May 1st, but did not mention my dream,
though I stated I was anxious for news. I began my letter with
a small joke, though feeling in anydiing but a joking mood.
Lady H.'s letter of May 5th reached me on the night of May
7th. From it I learnt, for the first time, of General H.-S.'s death
having occurred on April 29th, and the thought flashed through
ray mind, that accounts for all those " S's " in my dream.
Strange to say, I never once thought of the H.-S.'s untd I received
Lady H.'s letter, and yet I had met General H.-S., his son, and
daughter.

In reply to a further question. Miss F. writes on June
30th, 1910 :
I write to say positively that I had not heard of General H.-S.'s
illness or operation previous to my dream.
SITTINGS WITH EUSAPIA PALLADINO IN AMERICA.
Many of our readers will probably have seen the accounts
recently published in some of the American newspapers—especi-
ally the Ncxo York Times —of frauds practised by Eusapia
Palladino. Newspaper reports, whether favourable or the
reverse, of matters connected with psychical research, are of
course always to be received with caution, and in this case
330 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1910.
full authentic details of the sittings in question are still
lacking, though we hope to be furnished with them before long.
Meanwhile, we reprint from Science of May 20th, 1910, a
preliminary statement of the main results obtained in an
important series of sittings carried out during the early part
of this year at New York by nine Professors, of Columbia and
other Universities, who were assisted by conjurers, amateur and
professional.
Report of an Investigation of the Phenomena connected with
EusAPiA Palladino. . i
The undersigned had three sittings with the Italian medium,
Eusapia Palladino, in the Physical Laboratory at Columbia Univer-
sity in January last. The object in view was to secure and report
any evidence of the operation of hitherto unknown forces through
her or in her presence.
Though the investigation may fairlj' be called patient and
laborious, no convincing evidence whatever of such a phenomenon
could be obtained. Many indications were obtained, however, that
trickery was being practised on the sitters. These indications will
be more fully stated by the individual investigators.
So far as these sittings afford data for judgment, the conclusion
of the undersigned is unfavorable to the view that any super-
normal power in this case exists.

Hopkins.
It has been said that Eusapia finds trickery more easy than the
exercise of her supernormal power ; that she consequently resorts
to the former whenever the control by the sitters permits it ; and
that the only fair test is had when there is such control as makes
trickery absolutely impossible. During a fourth sitting, at which
the undersigned were present, something like this control was exer-
July, 1910. Sittings tuith Evisapia Palladino in America. 331
cised ; and while this was the case none of the so-called evidential
phenomena took place.

I have been present at nine sittings with Eusapia and in an
adjoining room at a tenth. Broadly speaking, her " phenomena,"
as observed in America and as reported before, fall into seven
classes: (1) levitations of a table, (2) rappings, (3) touches, (4)
breezes, (5) lights, (6) "materializations," (7) movements in and
about the cabinet. With the lights I was not favored. Of all
the other classes, I can say: (1) That conclusive and detailed
evidence was gained as to the method by which typical specimens
of them were repeatedly produced,^ and (2) that when the medium
was securely held they were not produced at all.
Statements of observations on essential points will, I trust, be
published later. These include each of the classes named.
* * *
Thanks are due to Messrs. W. S. Davis, J. L. Kellogg and J. W.
Sargent, who have all had much experience, both of professional
conjuring and of the investigation of mediums, and who gave their
time and invaluable services at my last two sittings. Mr. J. F.
Einn, a merchant, who is a trained observer and an investigator of
spiritualism, deserves special acknowledgments for his work as a
watcher. Dickinson S. Miller.
I agree substantially with the committee's report. My sittings
with Palladino have failed to convince me that she possesses any
unknown force. In fact, she has been detected in so much trickery
that there is in my opinion an extremely high probability that all
of the manifestations which I witnessed were produced by merely
natural means. But I do not feel that the methods and conditions
of our experiments were of such a kind as to warrant the rigorously
scientific and finally conclusive verdict for which we had hoped, or
even to justify quite the degree of emphasis expressed in the
majority report.
It has long been known that Palladino resorted to trickery, and
the claim has been made and will still be made that she finds it
easier to perform fraudulently that which she can and sometimes
does accomplish otherwise. The Cambridge exposure of 1895 proved
^ Accounts are presented in the article by Professor Jastrow in Collier's WeeJcly

332 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, i9io.
that she used trickeiy, but did not put a stop to her scientific
vogue. I had hoped, perhaps foolishl}', that our investigation would
be rather more than a repetition of something already accomplished.
And it seemed plain that the policy to pursue was to insist upon
conditions of control by mechanical means, which, instead of en-
couraging fraud by their looseness, should be so rigorous as absolutely
to eliminate her Avell-known tricks of foot and hand substitution.
If this plan had had a fair trial, and no " phenomena " had
resulted, our report might have given a permanent quietus to the
Palladino cult. W. P. Montague.
* * -it-
Professor Miller has asked me to add to the statement which I
signed as a member of the committee, a personal report of the
impression made on me by the three sittings with Eusapia Palladino
which I attended in January.
Judging from the eaidier sittings which I attended on the invita-
tion of Mr. Herewai'd Carrington, I should say that those held
with the committee were fairly representative as regards the class
of phenomena which Palladino has attempted to produce in this
country, though as regards quantity, rather than quality, they should
be regarded as poor sittings.
I was particularly struck by an incident which occurred during the
third sitting (January 22, 10. .32 p.m.), which goes to show how very
cautious one must be in accepting as evidential motions of objects
apparently out of reach of the medium.
From 10.29 p.m. until 10..32 p.m. objects were moved in the
cabinet behind E. P. while she was under the following conditions
of control—feet tied together by a rope which prevented her from
separating them by more than eight inches, in addition her ankles
were held b}' one of the sitters who had taken up a position on the
floor, each wrist tied to a wrist of her neighbor, on the right and
left, by means of a rope which allowed her ten inches free motion
in case she should elude the tactile control which her neidibors
were endeavoring to keeji. The light in the room at the time was
that from a frosted electric bulb which I estimated to be giving
about four candle power, placed about four feet from tlie medium's
head.
It Avould seem that the oljjects moved in the cabinet were outside
the range of free motion of her hands and feet, and the motions
seemed to be taking place under what might be called " test condi-
tions." However, the shorthand report of this sitting shows that
July, 1910. Sittings ivith Eusapia Palladino in America. 333
three of the sitters were convinced that the motions were caused by
the medium knocking over objects in the cabinet with the back of
her chair—I noted that so soon as her chair was moved openly a few
moments afterwards more objects fell.
I mention this particular incident as I think it shows how difficult it
is to obtain really "test conditions." Incidents of a similar character
at other sittings I have attended, where at first sight the conditions
of control seemed excellent, have rendered me extremely reluctant to
base an opinion as to this remarkable woman on the very interesting
reports of her numerous European sittings, but, so far as the evidence
collected at the relatively uninteresting American series of sittings is
concerned, I think it is decidedly unfavorable to Eusapia Palladino's
pretensions.
Augustus Trowbridge.
After attending six sittings with Eusapia Palladino, I find myself in
much the same position as at the start.
Many things have occurred which I find great difficulty in ex-
plaining by fraud while I have repeatedly seen trickery employed.
I have succeeded in watchincr the manifestations within the cabinet
throughout two entire evenings, the floor being illuminated with a
feeble light which was thrown by means of a mirror through a crack
between the bottom of the cabinet and the floor. The cabinet was
of wood built into a doorway, so that it projected back into the
adjoining room. My plan was to employ a powerful X-ray apparatus
and a large fluorescent screen, so that a shadow picture of whatever
was (Toing on within the cabinet could be obtained in the back room
at any instant without the knowledge of the medium.
The interior of the cabinet I viewed through a large hole cut in
the top, reclining on a mattress placed on the top of an instrument
case adjoining the doorway. The X-ray tube was placed within the
instrument case and carefully muffled, the fluorescent screen three feet
square was placed against the opposite wall of the cabinet, on the
outside of course. This apparatus was never actually used, owing
to the sudden termination of the sittings, but it was set up and
thorou!2;hlv tested, and sjave excellent satisfaction. I mention it as
it may be of use to future investigators, for, if properly installed, it
is proof against any fraud, as it can be used without the medium's
knowledge.
From my position above the cabinet I saw that whenever anything
in the cabinet was moved the curtain was pushed back, a black
object reaching in from Palladino's back groping around and finally
334 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1910.
seizing the table. Those who believe in Eusapia's supernormal powers
will say that this was the third arm. I need not say that an X-ray
picture of this third arm as seen on the fluorescent screen would be
an interesting subject of study. It would not be difficult to so
arrange the apparatus that the shadow of the medium's entire body
could be obtained. The switch for operating the coil should be
placed within reach of the observer on the top of the cabinet, so
that the flood of rays need only be turned on when something is
going on worth investigating. In this way no possible injury could
result.
At the first sitting at which the illumination of the floor was
tried Eusapia comijlained of this light, which appeared to be quite
accidental. I accordingly constructed a grill of vertical strips of
thin wood, painted black. The floor of the cabinet was covered
with this. From her position in front Eusapia could not have seen
the light on account of the grill, while the observer above, looking
down directly between the strips, could see the illuminated floor
without difficulty. The object of illuminating the floor was of course
to obtain a luminous l^ackground against which moving objects could
be seen. It proved to be a very effective way of investigating cabinet
phenomena.
On two occasions the black object whicli appeared was pointed,
on the third, when the table was seized, it was blunt and rounded.
Eusapia had pushed her chair back until her back was against the
curtain, and I doubt if what I saw was the " third arm " ! On the
occasion when I held one of Eusapia's hands, nothing was disturbed
in the cabinet, but some very fine levitations occurred, in a brilliant
light, and I could not only see between the medium's knees and the
legs of the table, but passed my other hand between them and her
skirts. I felt very positive that the legs of the table were free from
contact with any part of her person.
The proper system of investigation, in my opinion, is the one
outlined. Whenever I saw anything going on in the cabinet, I sent
an electric signal to seance room, so that particular pains could be
taken by the persons holding her hands, to see whether the contact
had been broken at the moment.
If the phenomena are genuine it can be proved by the X-rays, I
think, a7id in no other way. Madam Palladino need have no fear of the
X-ray test, if the thing seen in the cabinet is a supernormal third
arm. If the sittings had not been suddenly terminated, I feel certain
that at the next one we should have had a complete explanation
July, 1910. Sittings with Eusapia Palladino in America. 335
of how the disturbance in the cabinet was created. I am quite
ready at any time to aid Madam Palladino in establishing the
genuineness of her supernormal powers by means of the X-rays.

The following is a reprint, with some omissions, of the article
by Professor Joseph Jastrow (Professor of Psychology in the
University of Wisconsin) referred to above, which appeared in
Colliers Wccldy for May 14th, 1910. It will be noted that
the detective devices used were only adopted after abundant
evidence of fraud had been obtained on other occasions
The first seance was held at the house of Professor H. G. Lord
of Columbia University, on April 17, 1910. Those present, besides
Professor and Mrs. Lord and their guest, Miss E. K. Olmsted of Buffalo,
were Mrs. Fabian Franklin, Mrs. F. D. Pollock, Miss Carola
Woerishoflfer, all of New York ; Professors Dickinson S. Miller, J. B.
Fletcher, and Mr. A. A. Livingston of Columbia University ; Messrs.
W. S. Davis, J. L. Kellogg, J. IF. Sargent, Joseph L. Rinn, and
Warner C. Pytie of New York; Professor Joseph Jastrow of the
University of Wisconsin and lecturer in Columbia University, and
those Avhose names appear in italics, were also present at the seance
of April 24, held at the same place. In addition, there were present
at the second seance Dr. W. T. Bush, Professor W. P. Montague,
and Mr. W. B. Pitkin, all of Columbia University.
Mr. A. A. Livingston of Columbia University kindly consented to
act as interpreter. Eusapia arrived and departed under his escort.
She raised no objection to the arrangements of the sitters, though
in many seances she selects her right and left control. As the
seance was about to begin, the director of the seance proposed a
test of Eusapia's alleged power to influence by her "force" an electro-
scope—an experiment familiar to the medium in her European
sittings. The apparatus was brought to the room in its paper
wrappings, was duly disclosed and set on the table ; while the
company dramatically gathered about with expressions of eager
interest. Eusapia was absorbed in the experiment. The whole
device was a deco}', and provided a diversion and a screen of
" floaters," to conceal the entrance of two black-clothed and black-
stockinged forms, who wriggled their way along the floor to assigned
positions under the chairs of each pair of sitters at the sides of the
table. It was agreed that Eusapia's hands and feet should be
controlled " according to her instructions. The director dictated
336 Journal of Society for Psychical JResearch. July, 1910.
to a stenographer the "events" and the state of tlie "control," the
stenographer writing a few feet away by the light of a screened
lamp. The dictation served the double purpose of securing a record/
and of making natural a good deal of talking and comment. To
the frequent inquiries of Eusapia, who is supposed to understand
no English, whether all was well or what was said, the answer was
always reassuring, and it was stated the comment was directed to
the stenographer.
The evening proved rich in phenomena. The table rapped, rocked,,
tilted on two legs and on one, and left the floor completely. Under
lowered lights (signaled for by five raps of the table) the curtains
blew apart; a swelling appeared under the left curtain; the curtain
was blown over the table ; a tabouret emerged from the cabinet, was
balanced for a moment, repeatedly advanced and retreated, and at
last was lifted and deposited on the seance table ; later a hand
appeared against the cabinet over Eusapia's head ; there were more
bulgings of the curtain, more levitations ; and then the seven raps-
of the table, indicating the close of the seance, followed by a violent,
outburst from Eusapia when the sitters continued to retain their
positions. Such, with omission of all detail, was the seance. The
phenomena were those most commonly associated with this
" medium."
The witness below the chair on Eusapia's left had the position of
vantage. This was Mr. J. L. Rinn, a produce merchant of New
York City, who has long been deeply interested in the methods of
mediums, and has proved himself a reliable observer. Eusapia
begins by placing her right foot on the left foot of her right control
(Kellogg), and her left foot on the right foot of her left control
(Davis). Her problem consists in freeing her left foot for service-
and making the right foot serve to maintain contact with one foot
of each sitter.
The following by Mr. Rinn: "For a few minutes the medium
kept her feet tapping upon the feet of Messrs. Davis and Kellogg
without resting completely. Then she placed her right foot obliquely
with her heel on Kellogg's toe and her toe upon Davis's toe, facing
toward J. L. Rinn. Only one foot was in sight on the feet of
Kellogg and Davis. In a few moments, after some ejaculations in.
Italian from the medium, the table began to wobble from side to
side ; and a foot came from underneath the dress of the medium
and placed the toe underneath the leg of the table on the left side-
of the medium, and, pressing upward, gave it a little chuck into-
July, 1910. Sittings ivith Eusapia Palladino in America. 337
the air. Then the foot withdrew and the leg of the table dropped
suddenly to the tioor. More wobbling of the table occurred. Again
the foot came from underneath the dress of the medium and placed
itself underneath the leg of the table, forced the table upward from
the floor about half a foot, held it there for a moment, suddenly
withdrew its support from the table, which fell to the floor with a
bang. Each time after a levitation, the medium would appear to
rest her left foot upon the top of the right, which remained
constantly in an oblique position upon the feet of Davis and
Kellogg. At no time did she have her left foot hampered in any
way. It was constantly moving in the space about her chair ; and
I was lying with my face on the floor within eigJd inches of the
left leg of the table ; and each time that the table was lifted,
whether in a partial or a complete levitation, the medium's foot
was used as a propelling force upward. At one time the table was
lifted about two feet up from the floor. The starting of the lifting
was done by the left toe of the medium under the left leg of the
table ; and she appeared to rise up with it, using some other portion
of her body to raise it higher ; and from my point of observation
it seemed as if the knee, as well as the foot, was operating when
the table v/as lifted the highest. At different times throughout the
seance the medium caused rappings upon the table by striking the
left leg of the table with the side of her foot about three inches
from the floor."
And now as to the manifestations from the cabinet :
" A short
time after the liirhts were lowered she swuns; her left foot free from
her dress at the back and kicked the curtain of the cabinet
quickly, which caused it to bulge out toward the sitters. This was
done several times so daringly that under the chairs where I lay it
seemed almost impossible that the people above the table could not
have observed it.
"Later the medium placed her left leg back into the cabinet and
pulled out from behind the curtain a small table with certain
articles upon it, which was dashed to the floor in front of the
cabinet on the left-hand side. It remained there in varying positions
and was kicked by the medium a number of times. At one time
the medium juggled the table that had been kicked out from behind
the curtain on the end of her left toe, holding it oft' the ground and
balancing it on the edge of her toe in a very clever manner, so that
it gave the appearance as if the table was floating in the air.
"The light at all times, even when it was at its dimmest,
338 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, loio.
permitted me to see clearly the actions of her foot, as I was so
close to it that the movement of the foot caused the dress to lift
and more or less light shine through, so that at no time had I the
slightest doubt of the motive cause of any movement that occurred."
Next a brief statement from the other floor observer, Mr. Warner
C. Pj'ne, a student of Columbia University and trusted friend of
Professor Miller. Mr. Pyne moved away from Mr. Kellogg's chair.
"This put my head about under the center of the table, about five
inches from the feet of Messrs. Kellogg and Davis. The light was
very dim. I then saw the position of Eusapia's feet very well.
The heel of her rifjht foot was resting on the toe and forward part
of Mr. Kellogg's left foot, and the ball of her right foot was resting
on the toe and forward part of JMr. Davis's right foot. This left
Eusapia's left foot free."
Thus each floor observer corroborates the other. The same holds
for the cabinet phenomena. Mr. Pyne reports: "I was now enabled
to get a good view of what was going on, since the illumination
was much improved. Under the better light conditions, on two
separate and distinct occasions, I positively saw the medium's left
foot go back and touch the tabouret, which liad previously been
overturned and was lying on the floor to the medium's left. When
she touched the tabouret thus with the toe of her left foot it moved.
The first time she did it, nobody in the company seemed to notice
the fact that the tabouret was moving, which seemed to give
occasion for a second kick (a few seconds after the first). The
second time she kicked it, some one in the company remarked that
the tabouret was moving. The so-called '
echo ' raps I saw her
produce on two separate occasions by hitting the lower end of the
left leg of the table (about two inches from the floor) with the toe
of her left foot." An additional observation by Mr. Pyne, of a
levitation under lowered lights, is this :
'•
Somehow she got the left
leg of the table resting on the toes of her left foot. Her foot was
raised ofl^ the floor about three inches, and with the table leg still
resting on it, was moved about back and forth in the air with a
sidewise motion."
Such are the sights seen by the two men hidden under the
chairs. Let us turn to the evidence above-board. The critical
position at Eusapia's left was taken by Mr. W. S. Davis, who, like
Mr. Rinn, co-operated with Richard Hodgson in his investigations
of mediums in behalf of the Society for Psychical Research, and is
an expert of long training.
•
July, 1910. Sittings ivitlt Euso,pia Palladino in America. SSO
That Mr. Davis was well aware that Eusapia at the outset sub-
stituted her right for the left foot thus appears in his notes :
" Then
when she beat the air with her fist, thereby diverting attention and
creating a jerky mental impression, she correspondingly slid her left
foot off my right foot, until I felt pressure at the toe-end of my foot
only, whereas there had been pressure on my instep. She then
rocked the table from side to side, [with] all of our hands upon it,
uniil she saw that no apparent notice had been taken of her sliding
foot.
"Thoroughly convinced that Eusapia's left foot was not resting
upon my right foot at all, and that her other foot was touching me,
I cautiously raised my left foot, and passing it over my right foot
in the direction of Eusapia, was unable to touch her left leg from
the knee down, at the place where it should have been. After further
rocking from side to side (giving Eusapia ample opportunity to place
her toe under the table leg), the end of the table nearest to her
reared up. She held Ivellogg's left hand up in the air with her
right, while her left hand rested upon my right upon the table.
This rearing up occurred two or three times more ; and as there
were no obstreperous sceptics present to retard manifestations by
interfering with her methods, she felt sufRcientlj' safe to risk an
entire levitation, and the table went up into the air several inches.
" This particular levitation is the prettiest thing that Eusapia
does ; and it should not be confused with the miscellaneous levitations
occurring in the second act of her performance, when the lights are
poor, and when she gets the table up off the floor in any way she
can, some of her methods being exceedingly bold."
The cabinet tricks are performed partly by her left hand and
partly by her versatile left foot. Since the hand substitutions might
be seen even in the gloom, the left curtain is flung over the table,
and under cover of the curtain the hand substitutions are made.
Of this Mr. Davis reports
" The evidence that she used her left hand in producing part of
the phenomena in the poor light is more than ample. Before a
phenomena I usually felt her hand releasing its pressure, and during
a phenomenon contact with her appeared to be with the end of my
fingers only ; and after a phenomenon her truant hand returned to
mine with a firm touch, almost amounting to a grasp. Indeed, I
could generally tell in advance when something which her hand
could do would happen, and gave those near me some indications
of that fact. Also, our hands perspired somewhat, and when her
34:0 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jdlt, 1910.
hand came back to mine, the j^ers pi ration was often chilled, pre-
sumably depending upon the time that it had been away from
mine. /
"The curtain bulgings were upon this occasion performed in three
ways : Sitting sideways and pointing at a place on the left curtain
just on a line with her head, she said, look, or something which
meant that, and then blew the curtains so that there was a slight
ripple. She has a method of controlling her lips so that she can
blow from the side of her mouth without distorting her face or
making the effort very apparent. I noticed this with my own eyes
not more than two feet from her head. |
" The principal bulgings are produced by slapping the curtain from
the inside with her left hand, as I ascertained by seeing part of her
arm in motion. It will be remembered that the two curtains were
fastened at the top only and that they swung loose at the bottom,
at both sides, and in the center. (During some of the footwork
Eusapia kept the curtains from parting at the center by catching
them between her own back and the back of the chair.) The third
method of '
bulging ' consisted of striking the lower end of the
curtain with her foot, which sent a tremor along the cloth.
" During general physical manifestations she at times threw both
of her legs on my lap, but that only proved that she wasn't using
her feet at that particular moment ; and it wasn't necessary that
she should, for at that very time, when her feet were resting, she
was using her hand."
Mr. Kellogg, who acted as the control on Eusapia's right, is a
manufacturer of trick toys and apparatus. He likewise has been
deeply interested in the ways of mediums and their exposure.
The following notes from his report support the observations
of his companion on the left. Mr. Kellogg discovered Eusapia's
foot-substitution procedure independently.
" She placed her right foot on mine and her left on the right foot
of Davis. This was at the beginning. The pressure was inter-
mittent, and in a few moments it was plain that her right foot was
doing duty for both. The heel of her shoe only was on my foot.
During the entire seance I am positive that I did not lose the position
of her right foot or her rirjht arm. All the manifestations occurred on
her left side. She often took my left hand and placed it on her knee,
evidently to show me that it was quiet. She very carefully prevented
me from reaching across to the left knee at certain times, and it was at
these times I was convinced that the left leij was in full action. At
July, 1910. Sittings luitli Eusapia Palladino in America. 341
other times she carefully placed my hand across both her knees,
evidently to convince me that they were both quiet —^as they doubtless
were at such times."
Of the latter portion of the seance, with lowered lights, when the
cabinet phenomena appeared, Mr. Kellogg reports :
"She took my left hand and placed it over her right shoulder, far
enough to let me feel her left shoulder-blade, where I exerted some
l^ressure with the finger-tips. With my hand in this position it was
almost impossible to know whether she was moving her left arm or
not ; hence I took the liberty of placing the ball of my lef t wrist where
the tips of my fingers had been, and this gave me ample opportunity to
feel, with my fingers thus freed, the movements of the sleeve of her left
arm without her knowing it. Then it was plain that whenever the
curtain was sharply 'blown' forward, it was done by her throwing
it forward with her left hand with a quick impulsive jerk. It was
also plain that the hand we saw at the parting of the curtains was
none other than liers. The exact position is hard to describe ; but
she was half lying on my left arm, and this gave her plenty of
room for action on her left with both leg and left arm.''
The sitter at the end of the table, who had a good survey of the
scene as a whole, was Mr. J. W. Sargent, a professional conjurer,
well-versed in sleight of hand and the tricks of professed mediums,
and a past president of the Society of American Magicians. Mr.
Sargent corroborates, so far as his position permitted, the conclusions
of his colleagues. He testifies that he distinctly saw a number of
Eusapia's actions, such as the throwing of the curtain out upon the
table with her left hand ; that the so-called spirit-hand which appeared
behind her head was distinctly her own left hand, the arm remaining
invisible because of the lack of contrast of her black sleeve atrainsfc
the black curtains.
In consideration of the notoriety attaching to the performances of
this medium, it was felt that no step should be omitted which might
add to the convincing character of the verdict. It was accordingly
decided to supplement if possible the positive evidence by negative
evidence. At a second seance the following plan was successfully
carried out : In the first part of the evening to exercise just the
same lax control which inexpert sitters would use in response to
Eusapia's instructions, and to demonstrate that under these circum-
stances (closely duplicating those of the first seance) the same
phenomena would occur; and then, upon a given signal, to tighten
the control and rigidly guard both hands and both feet, and observe
342 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jult, 1910.
whether, under these circumstances, any "phenomena" would occur.
An interested and approving attitude was maintained, and in this
atmosphere, under lax control, levitations, curtain movements, and
cabinet phenomena duly appeared and continued for forty minutes
or more. Then, judiciously and expertly, Mr. Davis and Mr. Kellogg
controlled all suspicious movements of her hand and foot ; and the
phenomena slackened and stopped. They reported persistent and
increasingly strenuous attempts on the part of the medium to free
the left foot and to secure conditions favorable to the foot-substitution.
Eusapia's irritation arose ; she complained of the violence of her
restraint, which was in reality a most gentle but firm contact. In
agonised tones she cried out that the director's fingers, lightly touching
the leather heel of her shoe, aroused in her suddenly-made-sensitive
nerves the tortures of purgatory. Her protests grew louder, and
were echoed with passionate fervor by her sister-in-law, who came
with her to the sitting ; and at length she threatened to leave the
table. The observers remained unaffected, and, wary of any sudden
movement of Eusapia's hand or foot, continued to report her vain
efforts to evade the control. An intermission was taken. Eusapia
grew calmer, was permitted to put her hands on the table, and once
more attempted to distract attention by exciting cries and movements
but all to no avail. The hours slipped by ; the same conditions were
maintained, and all medinmistic phenomena ceased.
After the appearance of these articles, it was proposed to
hold a test sitting under certain conditions designed to prevent
fraud, so as to give Eusapia another chairce of showing her
capacity to produce genuine phenomena. Mr. Carrington, while
admitting the frauds practised, held to his belief in her posses-
sion of genuine supernormal powers, and in this he was sup-
ported by Mr. Howard Thurston, a professional conjuror (former
assistant and successor to Mr. Harry Kellar), who had witnessed
levitations of the table which he believed to be genuine. The
conditions for the test sittings were arranged jointly by Mr.
Carrington and Mr. Thurston on the one side, and Messrs.
W. S. Davis, Einn, Kellogg and Sargent on the other, and were
agreed to by Eusapia. She, however, failed several times to
keep her promise to attend, and the sitting has consequently,
we understand, not yet been held.
Opinions will, no doubt, differ as to the bearing of all these
observations on Eusapia's phenomena taken as a whole. The
July, 1910. Sittings with Eusccpia Palladino in America. 343
adverse evidence is the accumulation of a large number of
independent observations made at different times by different
persons ;
the three sittings reported by Mr. Dorr in the April
Journal were held on December 13th, 16th and 18th, 1909 ;
those reported by Mr. Krebs in the June Journal on December
17th, 1909, and January 10th, 1910,—both before the incident
of Eusapia's foot being caught in the cabinet had become
known ; while the sittings referred to in the present article
took place later and were held by other groups of persons.
It appears that while some individuals among these latter
are not satisfied that the tricks discovered will fully account
for all the phenomena they witnessed—in particular, for the
best cases of table-levitations—none of them has expressed
himself as convinced that any of the phenomena are genuinely
supernormal ; for there may, of course, be other fraudulent
methods not yet discovered, and it cannot be denied that the
more fraud is discovered, the greater becomes the probability
that all the phenomena are fraudulent.
The reader who wishes to form an unbiassed judgment of
the case is recommended to study again the Naples report,
which is agreed on all hands to furnish the best evidence so
far obtained in favour of Eusapia. It does not seem possible
to advance the matter further—one way or the other—unless
she will submit to further tests of a more stringent kind than
have yet been applied to her, and her refusal to attend the test
sitting arranged in New York permits of little hope that this
will ever be the case.
NOTE ON THE ABOVE.
By the Hon. Everard Feilding and W. W. Baggally.
It is perhaps premature to express an opinion on the sittings
referred to in the above account, and Ave defer any detailed con-
sideration of them until the actual shorthand reports are received,
and until Mr. Carrington is enabled to supply his comments. For
the present, it will suiEce if we state that on such evidence as is
before us we are neither of us moved to modify our original opinion
as expressed in our report on the Naples sittings. The American
evidence so far does not appear to do more than emphasize what
everybody knew already, viz. (1) that, if allowed to cheat, Eusapia
Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, loio.
will certainly do so, and (2) that on certain occasions nothing of
any evidential consequence occurs. Had we adopted what appears
to haA'e been the American system, that is, to permit indefinite
cheating during most of the seances and then to tighten up the
control and prevent it, and if a failure to produce phenomena had
happened to coincide with such prevention, we should certainly
have arrived at the same conclusions as the Americans. But our
effort in the Naples sittings M'as at all times to prevent cheating,
and the irregularity of the results was in no way to be accounted
for by any variation in the rigour of our control. Three out of
our eleven seances (3rd, 4th and 10th) were practically blank so
far as any evidential phenomena are concerned. If these had
happened to be seances at which the conditions were specially
rigorous, the inevitable conclusion would have been that the
"force" failed in consequence of the severity of the conditions.
This was, however, not the case.
When we seek to apply the explanations offered by the American
professors and conjurors to what we considered evidential pheno-
'
mena at Naples, their inadequacy appears to us clear.
(1) luqis. The American raps seem to resemble those which
occurred throughout all our sittings up to the eleventh, and all of
which (with one exception, Naples Report, Proceedings, Vol. XXIIL,
p. 491, Seance VIII., 11.19) we dismissed as non-evidential. But
at the end of the eleventh seance (see Eeport, p. -554) occurred
a series to which the explanations suggested above cannot apply.
(2) Levitations. Whether or not all the American levitations were
produced bj' the medium's foot, and on this jjoint the evidence of
the American observers themselves is decidedly conflicting, there are
numerous cases in the Naples Report where no such explanation is
possible. See, e.g., Report, pp. 423, 424 (10.24), 508 (10.14), and 510.
(3) Bulgings of tlie curtuiti. Mr. Davis speaks of these as a
"ripple" producible by blowing from Eusapia's mouth. Eusapia
constantly blows with her mouth, and takes no pains to conceal the
fact. But anv resultinii; tremblino-s of the curtain were never claimed
as "phenomena," nor would it have occurred to us to consider them
as such. The real bulgings are something wholly different from
what Mr. Davis describes (see Report, p. 333). If Eusapia can
make a curtain bulge slowly outwards by blowing at it from out-
side, she must be even more adroit than she is credited to be.
Nor were these bulges produced by her hands from within the
curtain, they being almost always both visible outside ; nor by her
July, 1910. Sittings tvith Euscqna Palladino in America. 345
feet, which can scarcely be supposed to reach above her head>
especially when they are tied; see, e.g., Report, pp. 366-70. Such
" explanations " as these are purely futile when applied to the
Naples sittings.
(4) A'ppearances and grasps of hands. It may be remarked that
whereas Mr. Podmore is convinced that these and other phenomena
were produced by Eusapia's right hand, the American observers
are equally convinced that they are performed with her left. For
an example which seems to show that neither the one nor the other
was concerned, see Report, p. 4-30, 11.10. It will be noticed that
one hand was held on the left corner of the table and visible, and
the other held under the curtain. Substitution at all events is not
possible. See also p. 516, 12.38, when both hands were visible and
both feet accounted for, one being stationary and the other moving.
Also p. 518, 12.51, and pp. 552-553, when both the medium's hands
were held by the same controller.
(5) Movements i>f objects at a distance. See Naples Report, p. 514,.
and F.'s note, p. 520.
It is needless to labour our case. No amount of arguing will
affect any one. But it is idle to suggest that a problem which
has puzzled so many of the best intellects in Europe for the last
twenty years can be disposed of so easily. We think we have said
sufficient to justify our impenitence, and for the rest await the
report of Mr. Carrington.
SOME POINTS IN THE RECENT REPORTS ON
AUTOMATIC SCRIPTS.
By Alice Johnson.
To those who are engaged in studying the evidence—obscure and
conflicting as it is —for survival after death, such criticisms as
those brought forward by Mr. Podmore in the last number of
the Journal are both welcome and valuable, and I wish to take
this opportunit}' of withdrawing a statement made in my Second
Report on Mrs. Holland's script, which he has there shown to be
unfounded. In referring to the Latin Message, I said that the
Piper-Myers " pointed out and maintained his point in the face of
every discouragement—that '
Browning Hope and Star ' was an
instance of the kind [of cross-correspondence] required" by the Latin
Message. This was written, someAvhat rashly, from my recollection of
the experiment as it was going on. After reading Mr. Podmore's
346 Journal of Society for PsycJdcal Research. July, l9io.
comments, I referred to the original records, which show that
while it is not certain that MyerSp realised the appropriateness of
"Browning, Hope, and Star" in relation to the Latin Message, his
tentative efforts after this realisation were in no way discouraged.
My statement then was much exaggerated.
The whole incident was an extremely complicated one, and certain
points in the trance utterances were sufficiently dubious to admit of
differences of interpretation. Under these circumstances we are clearly
bound to minimise the evidence for the supernormal, as Mr. Podmore
- has done. I tiiink, however, that he has gone rather too far in
this direction, and that his summary of the case—from its omitting
to indicate how appropriate manj' of Myersp's statements were to
the corresponding Verrall scripts—hardly gives a fair impression of
its evidential value. I therefore give another summary to supply
these omissions.
Dec. 17 th, 1906. Mr. Piddington dictates half of the first sentence
of the message to Myersp (p. 31 5).^
Dec. nth, 1906. Mrs. Verrall, knowing that the message is
shortly to be dictated, writes a script, appropriate to it,
about harmony and music, partly founded on some verses by
Mr. Myers (p, 309).
Dec. I9th, 1906, to Jan. 2i/(7, 1907, inclusive. Mr. Piddington
gradually dictates the rest of the message to MyerSp (p. 316).
In the waking stage of Jan. 2nd, Myersp said "United we
stand, divided we fall."' This would be an apposite comment
on the second sentence of the message, but was not definitely
stated to be connected with it (p. 317).
Jan. IGth, 1907. Mr. Piddington impresses on MyerSp the im-
portance of producing cross-corresponding messages, but
carefully abstains from any liint that what was wanted was
cross-correspondences of the complex type, i.e. the type
described in the Latin Message (pp. 318-9).
Mr. Piddington suggests to Myersp that when he gives
similar messages, say, to Mrs. Verrall and to Mrs. Holland,
he should mark each with a triangle within a circle to show
that there is a corresponding message to be looked for
(p. 36).
Jan. '23rcl, 1907 (Morning). MyerSp for the first time says that
he believes he can send a message in reply to the Latin
Message (pp. 319-20).

Feb. llfh, 1907. Myersp asks if Mrs. Verrall has received the

"Evelyn Hope," see pp. 322, 337, and 340) and says that
he also gave her Hope, Star and Browning (pp. 320-1).
Feb. 12//;, 1907. Mr. Piddington tells MyerSp that Browning,
Star, and Hope have appeared in Mrs. Verrall's script
(p. 322).
Feb. 12th-15fh, 1907. Mr. Piddington reads Abt Vogler for the
first time and interprets the line :

he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star," as an illustration
of a specially appropriate answer to the Latin Message

must explain your answer. You could do it in two
words.)
Hope Star.
(J. G. P. ^Yell? yes?)
Browning.
(J. G. P. Exactly. It couldn't be better.)"
Of the various topics mentioned here, "Halcyon days" and
" Syringa " are the only ones that are not connected with the
cross-correspondence. As to "Poems, my own —Browning—chiefly
Browning's lines," Mrs. Verrall's script of Dec. 17th, 1906, owes
much of its i^hraseology to some verses by Mr. Myers, and the
Verrall scripts included in my summary also contain allusions to or
quotations from poems by Dryden and Blake, while the chief points
are brought out by c|uotations from Browning.
It is true that " Horace " is not directly connected with the
cross-correspondence, and the statement that it was so was spon-
taneously corrected by MyerSp at the next sitting, on March 4th,
1907 (see p. 338); but the mention of Horace had considerable
significance in this connection (see pp. 339 and 398-414).
Taking all these records together, there is definite positive
evidence of supernormal knowledge on the part of MyerSp as to
the contents of jNIrs. Verrall's scripts ; while some of the remarks
he makes, and the time at which these remarks are made, suggest
at least a certain degree of comprehension of the relevancy of
^'Browning Hope and Star" to the Latin Message. When this
had once been mentioned in the trance, and Mr. Piddington had
signified his approval, no evidential weight is, of course, to be
attached to repetitions of it : the important question is whether
the idea originated with MyerSp or with Mr. Piddington. Mr.
Podmore inclines to the latter hypothesis. He mentions that at
the sitting of Feb. 11th, 1907, immediately after MyerSp had said,
" Look out for Hope, Star and Browning," Mr. Piddington asked
him to reply to the Latin Message at the next [really the next
but one] sitting; which, Mr. Podmore seems to imply, might have
given MyerSp a hint. If so, it was a purely accidental hint, for
at the time Mr. Piddington had not the least reason for suspecting
any connection between the two topics (p. 321).
Another point mentioned by Mr. Piddington in the Journal for
Jan. 1909 (Vol. XIV., p. 21) may be repeated here. "The fact
{says he) that cross-correspondences of a complex type began to
make their appearance only after the second sentence of the
July, 1910. Recent Rejyorts on AutomcUic Scripts. 349
message had been dictated to the controls, suggests—though it
certainly cannot be said to do more than suggest—that they may
have comprehended the second sentence, although the}^ made no
attempt to translate it. The trance-personalities, be it noted, were
never requested to translate the Latin Message. What they were
asked to do was to send an intelligent repl}^ to it."
Mr. Piddington nevertheless, as he authorises me to say, agrees
with me in admitting the force of Mr. Podmore's general criticism
of this case.
In regard to cross-correspondences in general, Mr. Podmore
suggests a comparison with certain early experiments in telepathy
conducted by Professor Eichet, of which one possible explanation
was that the thoughts of the agent were transmitted to the per-
cipient through the subliminal consciousness of a third person (the
"operator"), whose supraliminal consciousness did not at any stage
become aware of them.
From the more detailed account of these experiments given in
Phantasms of the Living (Vol. I., pp. 72-79), however, it would seem
doubtful whether there was any telepathic connection between the
operator and the other persons, or whether the percipient had not
unconsciously reckoned the point reached by the operator.^
I do not of course dispute that an idea may exist in the sub-
liminal consciousness without ever emerging into the supraliminal ;
but I maintain that the only evidence Ave can have of its existence
must be through its expression in some form, e.g. in automatic
writing. If it is not expressed at all, either explicitly or implicitly,
we cannot assume—as I think Mr. Podmore is sometimes too ready
to assume—that it exists.
He prefaces his criticism of the "Sevens case" - with the remark:
" It is always easier to believe in spirits than in any known cause,
because, knowing nothing about spirits, we are justified in crediting
them with omnipotence." Now, if human spirits survive bodily
death, it would seem that the only method by which they could
communicate at all, either with each other or with us, would be
through telepathy, that is, taking telepathy in the sense in which
it was originally defined in Pltaniasms of the Living, —"the ability
of one mind to impress or to be impressed by another mind other-
^The arguments iised in Phantasms against this hj'pothesis seem to me
unconvincing.

•wise than through the recognised channels of sense." It is probable
then that, if they survive, they have some telepathic power at least
in regard to one another ; whereas for us evidence of their survival
must be afforded, if at all, by telepathic communication between us
and them. Therefore to entertain the h3'pothesis that spiritistic
agency may have been one of the factors in the Sevens case, is to
make but a small assumption in regard to the powers of the
" spirits." Far from " crediting them with omnipotence," it assumes
only a certain degree of intelligent mental activity on their part,
with a certain limited power both of receiving mental impressions
from the living, and so acquiring knowledge of some of their actions,
and of transmitting mental impressions to the living, and so exerting
some influence on their actions, e.g. on their automatic script.
Mr. Podmore says that Mrs. Verrall's script of July 13th, 1904,
appears to have been influenced by telepathy from Mr. Piddington,
and observes that this script, which gave true information about
the contents of a living mind, gave at the same time false informa-
tion about the contents of a mind no longer living, and he adds
" Miss Johnson suggests that the true information may have come
from the disembodied intelligence which planned the whole scheme
from the other side. What then was the source of the false infor-
mation given in the same piece of writing 1
"
If this is a conundrum, I will ask Mr. Podmore another. Mr.
Podmore suggests that the true information may have come from
the embodied intelligence of Mr. Piddington. What then was the
source of the false information given in the same piece of writing?
But why should we suppose that the true and the false informa-
tion came from one and the same source, whatever that source may
have been 1 May not the false information have come from Mrs.
Verrall's subliminal imagination, while the true information came to
her telepathically from some mind external to her own 1
The reason against supposing this mind to be Mr. Piddington's is
that the script did not, as Mr. Podmore asserts, give " true infor-
mation about the contents of" his mind. The idea in Mr. Pidding-
ton's mind was that he would endeavour after death, not before, to
transmit the number Seven. Mrs. Verrall's script said: "In London
half the message has come." This sentence was perfectly meaning-
less if applied to what was happening and what Mr. Piddington
was thinking of at the time ; it did not in any way represent the
contents of his mind. It only made sense when applied to what
happened three years later ; it may be regarded in fact as a pre-
July, 1910. Recent Reports on Automatic Scripts. 351
monition of what did actually happen, though this was not what
Mr. Piddington wished or expected to happen.
Mr. Podmore goes on to say :
" The idea of Seven, latent probably
in Mrs. Verrall's mind for years, seems to have taken definite shape
on the occasion of her reading Dante, and to have been thence
transferred, in close alliance with Dantesque imagery, to the other
automatists." But the number 7 plays a very subordinate part
in Mrs. Verrall's script, and is not there associated with Dante at
all (see Proceedings, Part LX., pp. 225-6).
Mr. Podmore says later :
" Mrs. Piper has some mediaeval Latin
doggerel read to her and selects from it the words '
angel band
because Mrs. Verrall has for some days past been trying to say
'
angel band '
to her."
The description of the souls descending on Jacob's Ladder
occurs in Mrs. Verrall's .script of May 8th, 1908. This,
I find, was written between 11.30 a.m. and 12.30 p.m., whereas
" Angel band " was mentioned by Mrs. Piper on the same day
and at about the same hour, which—allowing for the difl:erence of
time between England and Boston —makes Mrs. Piper's utterance
about 4^ hours later than Mrs. Verrall's. " For some days past
seems therefore to be a slip of the pen ; Mr. Podmore probably
means " for some hours past." But it appears that, as a matter of
fact, this was not the first time that Mrs. Piper had mentioned
"angel band." In the waking stage of April 27th, 1908, she had
said "Angels' choir—seat of God," which is clearly intended as a
translation of the words "Angelorum chori—Deus sit." At the sitting
of May 4th, when Mr. Dorr read the verses through to her again,
at the words " Angelorum chori " the hand wrote :
" Yes, angel
chorus ;
" and again in the waking stage of this day she said
"Angels—they say God sits on his throne. ... I will go join the
heavenly choir."
It is clear then that the idea of Angel choir, chorus or band,
was prominent in Mrs. Piper's trance consciousness ^ for some time
before it emerged in Mrs. Verrall's script.
This fact, which Mr. Podmore has inadvertently misrepresented
through not having an opportunity of consulting the original records,
does not of course affect his main argument, for the case might equally
well be attributed to telepathy between the automatists, no matter
which of them was agent and which percipient ; that is, no matter
1 It seems equally clear that the primary reason of its prominence lay in the
likeness of sound between the English and the Latin words.
352 Journal of Society for PsycJdcal Research. July, 1910.
which of them had the idea first. But I think that we have no right
to maintain the existence of an idea—in a suiSciently potent form for
purposes of telepathy—in any one's mind without positive evidence.
There is little or no evidence for the association of iSeven with Dante
in the mind either of Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Piper, or ^Ir. Piddington ;
consequently telepathic influence from any of them seems to me
inadequate to account for a cross-correspondence compounded of
Seven and Dante.
Mr. Podmore's description of the part played by association of ideas
in the whole process seems to me illuminating and well founded
There are many cases in the scripts bearing out his notion that the
telepathic influence is often not strong enough to make the ideas
emerge of themselves, and that then the imported image can only mani-
fest itself when reinforced by its connection with images momentarily
passing through the mind. Thus, he says, in Miss Verrall's script,
" the idea of Seven calls up primarily images from botany and from
the book of Revelation. But these are fixed, it may be, because
they happen to coincide with Dante images." Quite so, but I ask,
who fixed them, unless it was some one who already had in mind
that combination ? Again, Mr. Podmore says that in Mrs. Home's
and Mrs. Holland's scripts the idea of the posthumous letter only
seems reproduced, but the time coincidence suggests that "Mr. Pid-
dington's influence could produce no effect until reinforced by Mrs.
Verrall's." But in what way can Mrs. Verrall's influence have rein-
forced Mr. Piddington's 1 It may be argued that Mrs. Verrall's
script affords some evidence of subliminal knowledge that Mr.
Piddington was trying some experiment (if his "posthumous letter"
may so be described) ; but there is no evidence of any subliminal
knowledge on her part of the subject of his experiment, that is, of
his letter. On the other hand, the scripts of the other automatists,
while showing some knowledge of the subject of Mr. Piddington's
letter, seem entirely ignorant of the authorship of the letter. What
evidence, then, is there that these scripts were influenced by Mrs.
Verrall 1
I think with Mr. Podmore that many of the items of this cross-
correspondence, taken alone, may be accounted for by the various
causes mentioned in my Report and reiterated by him here ; —associa-
tion of ideas, telepathy between the automatists, and chance coincidence
(e.g. he suggests that Mr. Piddington's "tic" and Mrs. Piper's "tick"
is only a chance coincidence, which would of course be the natural
explanation, if it were the only coincidence in the case). But I
July, 1910. Recent Reports on Automatic Scripts. 853
think that association of ideas fails altogether to account for the
coincidences, and that the coincidences are far too numerous and
detailed to be accounted for by chance. I understand Mr. Podmore
to agree with me so far.
I think also—and this is where we part company —that the way
in which a large number of details, some apparently of a completely
irrelevant kind, are woven together and fitted in to one harmonious
scheme, suggests the action of a mind with a more extensive knowledge
of all the circumstances, and consequently a greater power of guiding
them than there is any reason to attribute to any of the living
persons concerned.
NOTES ON CURRENT PERIODICALS.
In The Psi/cliological Bulletin of April 15tli, 1910, there is an
essay on Freud's Psychology by Dr. Ernest Jones. Any writer
who tries to give an intelligible account of Freud's work in a
short paper has unusual difficulties to overcome. One difficulty
is that Freud's views have undergone a continuous evolution
during the past twenty years, and his jDresent standpoint is not
easily understood except in the light of its historical develop-
ment. Another and greater difficulty is that Freud's Psychology
involves a radical change in our attitude towards the questions
of the structure and functioning of the mind. Its applications
are exceedingly diverse, and much of the cogency of Freud's
arguments is derived from the confirmation and mutual support
that the application of them receives from widely different fields
of study, such as psychopathology, dreams, wit, mythology and
every-day life.
The conception of the Unconscious {U nhewusstsein) as a sea
of submerged ideas and emotions interacting with and determining
the course of events in the consciousness which we know by
introspection forms the foundation on which Freud's psychological
superstructure rests. Freud's Unconscious is in truth not very
-different from Myers's Subliminal, but it seems to be more
acceptable to the scientific world, in so far as it has been invoked
to account for normal and abnormal phenomena only, and does
not lay its supporters open to the implication of belief in
•supernormal happenings.
The following are some of Freud's more general and funda-
mental principles referred to by Dr. Jones:
(1) Psycliic determinism.—Psychical processes are never
354 Journal of Society for Psycliical Research. July, i9io.
isolated or accidental phenomena. They are related to preceding
ones just as are successive physical events. There is no more
room for chance in the mental world than in the physical world.
(2) Quantitative elements m affective processes. —"There is
to be distinguished in psychical functions something (amount of
affect, sum of excitations) which has all the attributes of a
quantity—although we have as yet no means of measuring it,
something capable of being increased, diminished, displaced, or
carried off, and which spreads itself over the memory traces of
ideas, rather like an electric charge over the surface of the body."
The property in question may be described either in physiological
or psychological terms. It is assumed to have a certain autonomy
so that it can become transferred from one idea to another, the
latter then becoming in a sense the representative of the former.
(3) The dynamical nature of mental 'processes. —"Accompany-
ing every mental process is a varying amount of psychical energy
which roughly corresponds with what we term affect. Excessive
accumulation of this energy results in a tension that is experi-
enced as pain (Unlust), and there is a constant tendency towards
the discharge of this energy (Abfichr). The discharge is experi-
enced as pleasure, as relief or gratification (Befriedigungserlebniss)."
(4) Psychical repression. —The tendencies to seek pleasure and
to avoid pain are the fundamental regulating mechanisms of
mental processes, and such striving towards more or less definite
ends constitutes a wish in the broadest sense of the word. When
such a wish must not be gratified it is repressed. " The tendency
of the psychical energy to discharge itself is inhibited, a local
damming-up takes place, and the mental process in question
loses its former power of making free associations."
(5) Intra-psychical conflict. —It is the conflict between two
tendencies or wishes that leads to the repression, and Freud
maintains that
'
' when a mental process is the seat of a com-
petition of opposing affects, blocking {Sperrung) of the usual
associative activities occurs, and the mental process becomes shut
off or dissociated." Consciousness exerts a censorship which pre-
vents the emergence of the pain-producing mental process, and
the psychic energy pertaining to the repressed "wish" must find
an 6utlet in some direction other than the direct route into
consciousness. In abnormal cases of repression it may be con-
vei'ted into physical innervation or become linked with indifferent
mental processes, so giving rise to hysterical manifestations or
phobias and obsessions.
July, 1910. Notes on Ctivrent Periodicals. 355
(6) Infantile mental processes. —According to Freud uncon-
scious mental life is indestructible and the intensity of its wishes
does not fade. Consequently, he lays great stress on the mental
processes of early life, and believes that they form the basis of
character. They persist in the unconscious, and form the springs
of conduct all through life. The wishes and interests of adult
existence are chiefly significant in so far as they ally themselves
with those of childhood. This association is unconscious, for the
significant wishes of childhood are repressed in the course of
training and education.
(7) The importance of psycho-sexual trends. —Some miscon-
ception of Freud's views has perhaps arisen owing to the
multiplicity of functions and mental processes whose origin he
derives from the sexual instinct. His conception of the wide
domain of sex in psychology is, however, only the application in
an unusual field of a wide generalization made lone ago by
biologists—the dichotomy of life-interests into self-preservative
and reproductive.
The main principles of Freud's psychology are thus resumed
by Dr. Jones: "Freud lays stress on the dynamic aspects of
mental processes, and sees in the tendency of the affects to seek
discharge of their tension the motive force determining the flow
of mental life ; he expresses this in terms of wishes. He holds
that unconscious mental life is rich and complex, and by the
interaction between it and consciousness explains the ajDparent
discontinuity of conscious processes, thus adopting a deterministic
attitude towards intuitive and apparently spontaneous mental
events. Much of this interaction depends on the result of con-
flicts between various psychical trends, some of these undergoing
repression, so that they can be manifested only along indirect
channels. He attributes fundamental importance to the repressed
wishes of early childhood life, and to the psycho-sexual systems
of activities."
Freud's views are arousing considerable interest among
psychologists at the jaresent time, and various articles dealing
with the different aspects of his work have ap23eared of late in
the psychological journals. In the Journal of Abnormal
Psychology, Feb. -Mar., 1910, Dr. Bernard Hart writes on "The
Conception of the Subconscious," chiefly with reference to
Freud's views. The A?nerican Journal of Psychology ,
April,
1910, is almost entirely devoted to Freud's work. Five lectures
delivered by Freud at Clark University in September, 1909, are
356 Journal of Society for Psychical Researcli. July, i9io.
translated. Three lectures by Jung on " The Association
Method " are also reported. Dr. Ernest Jones writes on Freud's
theory of dreams, and Dr. Ferenczi, of Budapest, deals with the
same topic '
in a lecture on "The Psychological Analysis of
Dreams."
T. W. M.
The Bevue Philosophique for April and May 1910 contains a study by
Professor Pierre Janet on a case of prolonged doable consciousness
which he entitles Une Fdida artificielle.'^ The patient's history in
fact presents a close resemblance to that of Dr. Azam's famous
patient, only that in Dr. Janet's case the state of secondary
consciousness was produced by suggestion. The patient as a girl of
19 was practically given over by the doctors: her stomach refused
to retain any nourishment, she was in the extremity of feebleness
and inanition, reduced almost to a skeleton, all but blind and deaf,
and without sensation over the whole surface of the body. By means
of suggestion she was put into an "alert" state in which she re-
covered her lost sensibilities and her power of retaining nourishment to
such an extent that she put on 18 lbs. in three months. Gradually
by means of suggestion the alert condition was prolonged until it
came about that the greater part of her life was spent in that state,
with great benefit to her health. Always when she " awoke " to
her original state, the old digestive troubles returned, and her
condition was rendered the more wretched by the fact that, like
Felida, she had entirely lost her memory of the time spent in the
alert state.
But Marceline's state differs from that of Felida, as portrayed
for us by Dr. Azam. In this latter case we do not find two sharply
defined alternating memories. In Marceline's depressed state she
loses all the memories of the alert state. But she is liable to lose
other memories as well. Thus on one day in October 1898, in the
depressed state, she went back to May 189-i, and put that date on
all her bills in the shop where she served. Her distress at the
mistake caused a still further loss of memory, and on the next day
she went to resume her duties in a shop which she had left in
1888, and being unable to find it, presented herself to M. Jules
Janet, who had ceased to treat her in 1889, when he handed the
case bver to his brother. In short, in carrying his analysis a little
farther, M. Janet finds that the phrase alternating personality is
too clear cut to fit the facts, at any rate in the case of Marceline.
What we find on the physiological side are many diff"erent degrees
of anaesthesia and muscular disturbance : and corresponding to this
on the psychical side what may be described as fluctuations in the
level of consciousness. M. Janet suggests that in the classical case
of Felida it is possible that a closer analysis would have shown
variations of level in the so-called secondary personality. F. P.

OBITUAEY.
William James and Frank Podmore.
Since the last number of the Journal appeared, we have
suffered heavy loss in the death of two of our most eminent
members, Professor William James and Mr. Frank Podmore.
Mr. Podmore's long-continued and zealous services in the
collection and appraisal of evidence in all departments of our
work have from the beginning been of the greatest value to the
Society, while whatever reputation for scientific thoroughness,
critical acumen and sobriety of judgment it possesses in the
eyes of the serious outside public is largely due to the brilliant
series of studies ^ in which he showed what it has-—and what it
has not—accomplished.
Professor James, the foremost psychologist of his day, who
was President of the Society in 1894-95, by the support both
of his name and of his unfailing and cordial sympathy, lent
weight to its work, not only in his own country, but through-
out the civilised world.
At our next meeting, as announced above, memorial papers
will be read, which will afterwards appear in the Proceedings.
CASE.

. - -
The following case of a premonition was received from Dr.
Emil Mattiesen, an Associate of the Society, who collected the
evidence for it and also kindly furnished translations of the
witnesses' original statements, which were written in German.
The full names and addresses of all the persons concerned
were given to us, but we were requested to print their initials
only. Miss L. P>.'s hrst account, which was received by
Dr. Mattiesen on July 27th 1909, was as follows:
On June 6th, 1908, ray father died suddenly from brain-
apoplexy, without any previous illness, having only mentioned [on
May 31st] a shght pain in the chest, which caused us to ask him
to consult a physician, by whom he was pronounced perfectly

healthy. Now I, his daughter, had experienced the same pain
since May 26th, which my father took for a cold. On my men-
tioning [on Ma)^ 31st] that to this pain there was added in m}'
case a peculiar feeling of suffocation, sudden breathlessness, and
great anguish, my father looked at me with surprise, and he, who
never complained of any indisposition, confessed that he felt exactly
the same sensations. With me these sensations grew to an unbear-
able degree; I took bromides, etc., but without .any effect. On
May 30th I was dining with my fiance and a friend in a wine
restaurant, when for the first time I understood this feeling of
dread : it meant that I was to lose my father, and I said so to both
gentlemen, who only made light of it. But I found no rest, until
I M'ent home and waited in the front garden, and saw my father
come in, looking healthy and vigorous.
The day after this I went with the same gentlemen on an
excursion to a neighbouring village, where I had frequently been
with my father. There also I was able to stay but a few moments.
The ever-growing dread gave me no rest. I spoke about it to my
companions, who now became annoyed about my forebodings, because
I was spoiling their fun and wanted to go home. At home I
found my father in the garden occupied with his flowers, but still
I could find no real peace.
On June 2nd the above-mentioned consultation took place, but in
spite of the doctor's cheerful pronouncement, my sensations did not
leave me. On the [previous] afternoon my father had given me a sum
of money to take to the bank, a commission I had frequently been
entrusted with, but which I found impossible to carry out this time.
I asked my sister to go in my stead, as I was tortured with a sudden
feeling : your father is providing for you for the last time. On June
4tli my father was free from pain, so that he made no use at all of
the plaster which the. doctor had advised him to put on the aching
spot on his chest. During the following night I was awakened by
a sudden bark of our dog who slept in the passage. I as well as
my sister distinctly heard a low soft voice which sounded as if
somebody was trying to quiet the animal. Although I assumed it
to be my brother who occupied a room at the other end of the
passage, I was seized with an unspeakable horror and shivering, so
that I ran out, and found the dog sitting bolt upright, but heard
nothing further. (My brother had heard the bark, but had not
spoken.) In my anguish I ran into my parents' bedroom and
roused my father. Only when I heard his voice I calmed down
360 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., l9io.
sufficiently to return to my room, but got no further sleep. For
one moment I saw with terrible clearness my father dead and laid
out before me.
On June 5th in the afternoon we went out on a steamer to
Z., an excursion place near S., in response to an invitation of
Herr von L. for the celebration of his birthday. I found it
impossible to share in the festive feelings of the company, and
was repeatedly questioned about it, all the more as my paleness
attracted attention. Then a ramble into the forest was proposed, in
which my parents took no part. Driven by my inward dread, I
left the company and ran back only in order to see my father.
During the afternoon of the 6th I went to the railway station to
post an urgent letter, when suddenly this dread seized me with a
perfectly crushing power. Having got home I found my father
sitting at a window with a book, whereupon he read to me the
conclusion of a novel we had been reading together. Then we went
in to supper, after which my mother and sister went to the kitchen
in the basement, while I remained alone with my father, who was
reading his paper at the table, sitting behind him on the sofa and
playing with our dog. Suddenly my father's head sank on to the
table ; I lifted him up, and saw what had happened. From that
moment I became quiet and calm. . L. B.
After carefully cross-examining Miss B. and her friends,
Dr. Mattiesen writes
Odoler Tith, 1909.
I have examined all the members of the household separately,
and . . . they declare unanimously and positively that Mr. B.
had not complained in any way or to anybody about the oppression
on his chest before May 31st. He was noted in the town and in
his own house for never mentioning troubles. Besides, he was a
robust man and "quite exceptionally healthy," who had "never
been ill or missed a day's work" until New Year's Eve (Dec. 31st,
1907), when he had apparently caught a severe cold, and quietly
left the company before midnight, without a word of explanation,
went to the funeral of a friend on Jan. 1st, and was delirious with
influenza till the 12th. He soon recovered, however, and was able
to look after his office duties in March. During April and May he
was in his usual health, not feeling any after eff'ects of his illness,
and in excellent humour, "always jolly." Miss B. had no conscious
anxiety at all about her father during most of this time. When
Oct., 1910. Case. 361
she began to experience her objectless "dread" and "restlessness," she
cannot tell exactly; "it came on gradually." On the 1st of May,
perhaps, she was for the first time clearly conscious of it, when,
going to a concert she had been looking forward to with much
pleasure, she felt like going home before reaching the hall. From
the 1st of May till the 26th this restless feeling "never left her
entirely," and she fought it, but without any success, by swallowing
bromides which she purchased secretly, in order not to trouble her
family.
Miss B. ... is constitutionally rather strong, "entirely without
nerves," as she says herself. "I have never known anything like
this before, healthy and vigorous creature that I am. Anybody
could testify to that. When my grandmother died some years ago,
1 experienced nothing of the sort. My friends have often expressed
their envy at my total absence of '
nerves.' I was in perfect health
at the time." . . . . ,
Dr. G. S., Miss B.'s fiance, confirms the account as follows
August \st, 1909.
A fortnight before the death of my father-in-law, my fianc4e. Miss
L. B., complained of a singular pain in the chest and [a feeling of]
strangulation in the throat, coupled with a strong sensation of
dread ; all remedies employed produced no improvement. On May
28th, 1908 (Ascension Day), I accompanied my fiancee on a walk
through the town of S. I wanted to show her some objects in
a shop window, but she was so restless that I had to take her
home without having attained my end. On the way home she told
me that she was much in dread about her father ; she had a pre-
monitory feeling that he was going to die soon. [Dr. S.'s memory
seems to be at fault as to the day of this confession. See above.]
I replied that there appeared to be absolutely no reason for it.-
On May 30th I went with my fi,ancee and a friend to a wine-
restaurant for dinner. There my fiancee was again seized by such
a feeling of dread that though my friend and myself tried to soothe
her, we had to break up soon again and go home.
On May 31st, in the afternoon, we rode to a neighbouring village.
On our way home, about 150 steps from the restaurant we had
visited, my fiancee said to me :
" Do you think we shall ever again
come here with father ? " I became rather angry, and asked her
why she was always putting such questions to me, since there was
absolutely no reason for any uneasiness whatever. She replied :
" I
'362 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1910.
believe that he will die soon ; that's why I have this horrid dread,
.which does not leave me."
On June 2nd ray father-in-law, yielding to the requests of his
family, as he complained of a dull pain in the chest, though other-
wise feeling well and going about his official duties as befoi'e, went
to consult a physician ; he was certified to be in perfect health.
On June 5th, while we were celebrating the birthday of a friend,
I was struck by the silent manner of my fiancee, so that I asked
her several times whether there was anything the matter with her,
in reply to which I only received the same complaint about the
feeling of dread already described.
On June 6th, at 6 p.m., we were riding on bicycles to the S.
railway station to take a letter, about which there was some hurry,
to the mail train. On the way out my fiancee again complained of
a terrible feeling of dread, giving the same reason as before. We
therefore hurried to get home, where we found my father-in-law
sitting in his easy-chair and reading, lie spoke with great vivacity
about a novel he had just finished reading, and said the author had
got over his dinouement in a very simple manner. This w^as about
7 p.m. He then supped with good appetite, lit a cigar, and read
the paper. About 8.30 he suddenly dropped, without uttering a
sound, from his chair ; he had died from a stroke of brain-apoplexy.
G. S.
Miss E. P., of Graz, Styria, states that she received a letter
(since destroyed) from Miss L. B., dated June 2nd, 1908, which
to the best of her recollection was to the following effect
An unspeakable dread about my father gives me no rest.
Though complaining of nothing but an insignificant fatigue, he con-
sulted a physician, who assured us that my father was in perfect
health, which could not, however, appease my dread about him.
Dr. Mattieseu adds :
A similar, but shorter statement, is contained in a letter from Miss
B. to Miss G. AV., dated June 4th, 1908, which I have been per-
mitted to see. . .
-
We have also a fully corroborative account written by Miss
L. B.'s sister. A., but as it is almost identical with Miss L.
B.'s, we omit it here.
Dr. Mattieseu also sends us the followincr translation of all
Oct., 1910. Case. 363
the entries iu Miss B.'s diary from May 26th to June 6th,
1908.

ON THE RECENT AUTOMATIC SCRIPTS—A FURTHER
COMMENT.
By Frank Podmore.
There are two points in Miss Johnson's remarks in the July
Journal on my comments on the recent automatic scripts on which
I should wish to say a few more words in explanation.
(p. 349) "It is always easier to believe in spirits . . . because
we are justified in crediting them with omnipotence." Miss John-
son's comments on this remark of mine seem to me sound, and,
indeed, incontrovertible. But they do not touch my argument
perhaps because it was not clearly expressed. Let me give a con-
Crete illustration of my meaning.
Miss Johnson (p. 3-51) takes exception to my remark "Mrs.
Verrall has fryr some days past," on the ground that Mrs. Verrall's
script was actually written only a few hours before Mrs. Piper's.
My "some days," however, had been intended to refer, not to
Mrs. Verrall's script, but to the images aroused in her mind by her
reading of Dante, which had been going on for " the first week
in May." To which Miss Johnson would probably reply (1) that
364 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1910.
Mrs. PijDer had actually mentioned "Angels' Choir" on April 27th,
(2) that I have no right to assume the existence in Mrs.
Verrall's mind of an idea not yet expressed. (See her remarks in
last paragraph but one on p. 349.),
To all which I can only reply that Miss Johnson's remarks are
eminently just, and point to a real defect in my statement of the
theory of telepathy from the living.
Miss Johnson is able to pick holes in the hypothesis of telepathy
from the living. But it is not open to me, or to any one else, to retort
by picking holes in the hypothesis of telepathy from the dead. We
have here no limitation of place or time. We are at liberty to credit
the spirits with omnipotence, because we cannot know of any limits to
their povjer.
(p. 350) In posing this " conundrum " I must again plead guilty
to some obscurity of expression. I will try to restate my point
in plain language. The same passage in Mrs. Verrall's script con-
tains a fictitious spirit message and a piece of true information about
Mr. Piddington's contemporary proceedings. Miss Johnson suggests
that this piece of information possibly (or probably, I am not sure
which) came from a spirit, because the mode of its presentation
suggests a spirit rather than the mind of Mr. Piddington. To which
my reply is that the subconscious mind of Mrs. Verrall, which in this
very passage has shown itself capable of working up imaginary details
into a wholly fictitious but nevertheless plausible spirit message, must
surely be adjudged capable of working up telepathically received
information into a similar fictitious form. I could expand the argu-
ment by reference to the analogy of dreams, where a like process is
of frequent occurrence : and by further insistence on the fact that
the " spirit message " forms, so to speak, the mould in which the
subconsciousness of Mrs. Verrall and of most other automatists prefers
to cast its communications.
[The above letter was received by me from Mr. Podmore shortly
after the July Journal came out. I wrote to him in reply to the
effect (a) that he seemed to be mixing up the Paradiso and the
Purgaforio in his comments, since what Mrs. Verrall had been reading
was the Purgatoiio, whereas Mrs. Piper's script, as I interpreted it,
referred to the Jacob's Ladder of the Paradiso ; and {h) that I fully
admitted the possibility that the subliminal consciousness might work
up telepathically received information into a fictitious form, but
that the information about Mr. Piddington's letter was not worked
up into a fictitious form by Mrs. Verrall's script. What the script
Oct., 1910. On the Recent Automatic Scripts. 365
said ("In London half the message has come") was a true description
of the future, though—if interpreted at the time—it might have
appeared a fictitious description of the contemporary circumstances.
The essential part of Mr. Podmore's letter in reply to me, dated
August 9th, 1910, is printed below. A. J.]
(a) There is no mistake on my part. I think the reference of
" Borne far aloft on oarage of their high wings " [in Mrs. Verrall's
script] to Jacob's ladder very dubious. But clearly the whole poem
refers to Dante, and the reading of any part of the Divine Comedy
would be likely to call up visions of angels. That is all that I
meant to imply.
(b) "In London half the message has come." I am afraid I missed
your point, that this sentence seemed to imply preternormal know-
ledge of the future. But there is a perfectly normal and plausible
interpretation at hand. The idea of cross-correspondences was already
in the air, and Mrs. Verrall's subliminal self might naturally take
Mr. Piddington's message in London as an attempt at a cross-
correspondence. I don't admit the prophecy. But I should like to
hear whether you have any further argument in support of the
suggestion.

OX A SITTING WITH ME. AND MES. TOMSON.
By Sir Oliver Lodge.
[Sir Oliver Lodge, having been informed that Mr. Tomson hfis
recently claimed his authority as vouching for the inexplicable
character of certain " cabinet " performances, desires that the'
following contemporary report by him of the only one of tliese
performances which he witnessed should now be printed in the-
Journal.—Ed.]
January 'loth, 1909.
Mr. Stead kindly invited me to occupy a seat in his drawing-
room, while a seance was conducted with Mr. and Mrs. Tomson,
on the evening of January !^2nd, 1909, and he strongly urged
me to attend. ,
As I happened to be in London for a Mansion House meet-
ing on that day, I accepted the invitation, and agreed to abide
by conditions drafted by himself in consultation with the Hon.
Everard Feilding, Hon. Secretary of the Society for Psychical
SGfi Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., i9io
Eesearch ;
only stipulating that I should not be called upon
to sign any report at the time, nor agree to any joint report,
but should make my own report at my own time, though in a
spirit of fairness to all concerned.
For no other report than my own am I in any way respon-
.sible, nor do I know that any other report has been made.
What happened, so far as I was concerned, was this. I
Teached Mr. Stead's house about 6.45 p.m., found a certain
number of persons assembled to whom I was introduced, those
I had previously known being Mr. Feilding and Mr. and Mrs.
ISaggally. I found also an impromptu " cabinet " erected in
one corner of the sitting-room, built up of ordinary iolding
screens so as to form sides, back, and roof, with a pair of cur-
tains in front running with rings on a light iron rod. This
cabinet I was invited to take to pieces and rebuild, which
accordingly I did, examining the rug below, the corner of the
room behind, and removing all stray objects from the neigh-
bourhood.
I am able to certify that the cabinet was absolutely fair,
and that no white material nor other objects were accessible
from its interior when erected ;
nor was there anyone behind
dt to pass things in. A single ordinary cane chair was placed
in the cabinet for the medium to sit upon.
We then waited a little time for Mr. and Mrs. Tonison, who
were late; but about 7.30 they arrived at the house, and,
without entering the room, were conducted to their respective
•dressing-rooms by the gentlemen and ladies respectively who
had undertaken the office of searchers. I remained in the
drawing-room all the time, with the cabinet.
By reason of their experience in these matters I wish to
say that I have confidence in any careful and leisurely state-
ment made by either Mr. or Mrs. Baggally.
After a further interval Mr. Tomson was brought in by
two gentlemen (Mr. Feilding and Mr. Baggally), one holding
each hand ; and at his own request they continued to hold
him thus until after the first manifestation.
Mrs. Tomson, attired in dark garments, was brought in
similarly by two ladies (Mrs. Baggally and her lady friend),
and was conducted straight to the cabinet, where she sat down
•on the chair, and the curtains were drawn.
Oct., 1910. On a Sitting with Mr. and Mrs. Tomson. 367
The company sat more or less facing the cabinet.
I'rom this time Mr. Tomson, seated, and at first still held,
took control. He asked for the main light to be extinguished,
leaving only a red lamp, and twice subsequently he asked for
that to be lowered too. He also asked for the pianola to be
played. The light was regulated, at Mr. Tomson's request, by
Miss Stead, or another, who stood near the lamp, which was
behind the spectators but facing the cabinet. It seemed to be
a paraffin lamp covered with red paper. The light was quite
dim, but the position of everybody could be seen ; and the
cabinet could be seen too.
Before long a bunch of white drapery was protruded through
one of the two side chinks of the curtains—that on the left of
the spectators—near the Hoor ; it was moved about a little, and
then withdrawn.
It next appeared in tlie middle chink of the curtains, again
near the floor, and now it gradually displayed more and more
of itself, giving an appearance of vertical growth, till it rose to
the stature of a human figure, the growth being probably really
due to the curtain chink being gradually opened from below
upward, while something white was gradually unfolded until it
filled the space behind the gap. A figure in white could now
be dimly seen, and after one or two apparent efforts it came
between the curtains, and hesitatingly advanced a few inches
beyond them, but ready to retreat instantly. This was repeated
more than once.
Mr. Tomson, now released, rose and led me to the figure, himself
standing on my left and holding my right hand continuously.
The figure touched my head with its hands. It was certainly
a person, and had all the appearance of being the medium, but
swathed now in gauzy white drapery thrown over the head and
arms, and over its ordinary clothes also apparently. The appear-
ance was whitish from head to foot. My hand was not
released, and I did not touch anything.
After I was re-seated, others were led up to a similar
appearance, which was repeated from time to time without
much variation. But occasionally a black skirt like that of
the medium could, by those seated, be seen on one side of the
white, and immediately under it, as if the white had been
accidentally displaced.
368 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1910.
The appearance might probably be produced by hanging a
strip of white, gauzy material down the front of the medium
while she was standing up in the middle chink of the curtains,
with another strip floating over head and arms.
So far as the face could be seen, in the dim light, it looked
like that of the medium.
At a later stage, and after several persons had entered the
cabinet in threes, holding each other's hands, the curtains were
drawn partially back, and we, still seated, were called upon to
recognise the medium and the white figure separate, inside the
cabinet and at the back : but nothing was distinct. All that
could be seen was the dim white face of the medium seated
in her chair, and a bunch of white stuff, probably intended for
another form, a little ou her right and above. This part of the
demonstration was valueless, at least on that occasion.
Finally, first I and then Mr. Baggally were called up to the
outside of the cabinet and told to hold out our hands for
something. Thereupon through the chink a double handful of
soft stuff was placed in my hands, which, when taken to the
light, proved to be chiefly maiden hair fern with some white
flowers below. Something dropped from the clump as it was
being handed to me, which proved to be blue violets when
they v/ere subsequently picked up from the carpet. Two red
flowers were also subsequently handed to me by some one in
the audience as having been part of the parcel. Probably they
were picked up too. The flowers and ferns I received could
be compressed into small compass, but they had been opened out
into the double handful I have described. They were not
specially damp, nor had they any smell that I could detect.
They gave me the impression of being slightly warm, i.e.,
warmer than ordinary fresh flowers, and of having been
crumpled up.
The lights were now turned up and the sitting ended.
On withdrawing the curtains the medium was seen to be
seated asleep in her chair, clothed in black as at the beginning,
and nothing else was in the cabinet.
Mr. and Mrs. Tomson were led off as before to their
respective rooms, and as they went I tried to suggest to
the lady-searchers to seek for the case in which the flowers
had presumably come ; while it was obviously desirable to
Oct., 1910. On a Sitting tvith Mr. and Mrs. Tomson. 3G9
ascertain what had become of the white drapery which had
been seen.
It might, for instance, have been left in the cabinet ; which
was not the case. It might have been handed to Mr. Tomson,
in which case it would be found by the gentlemen searchers.
Or it might have been placed in a pocket of some unsuspecting
visitor ; but as I had not the slightest reason to suspect con-
federacy, this was unlikely, since there was not much chance
•of being certainly able to remove it again before detection. Or,
finally, it might have been retained by the medium, probably in
less compact and elaborately disposed form than that in which
it had been originally introduced. So a great deal depended
on the final search.
That of Mr. Tomson proceeded without incident, but from
Mrs. Tomson's room upstairs presently proceeded a loud,
hysterical voice, " I will not do it," repeated several times.
Miss Stead came down for Mr. Stead, and shortly afterwards,
Mrs. Baggally and her friend descended, saying that the con-
cluding search had not been allowed in wliat was to them a
satisfactory manner. So at that point the incident terminated
as far as I was concerned, and soon afterwards I left the house.
I wish to thank Mr. Stead for kindly giving me the oppor-
tunity of witnessing what he no doubt considered, and probably
«till considers, a remarkable demonstration. And I wish
especially to thank the searchers for endeavouring efficiently to
discharge their thankless and distasteful task.
As regards my own opinion on the subject, I regard the
affair as a performance, in which some flimsy and compressible
white drapery and some flowers are ingeniously concealed until
the time comes for producing them. I conjecture that the
flowers may have been, at some early stage of the sitting,
extracted and deposited perhaps under the chair to cool, while
the drapery was employed in ingenious and effective fashion.
The flowers were then bestowed on the company, and the
drapery once more concealed.
I am not prepared to say exactly how the drapery or the
flowers were concealed, preparatory to their introduction and
partial removal, though I have my own ideas on the subject
but to my mind there was no evidence of anything of a super-
normal character.
370 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., i9io.
I did not, indeed, hear such a claim made by either of the
entertainers ; I prefer to assume that their desire is to show
how much can be accomplished by normal means. If the
exhibition of any supernormal power is claimed, then I strongly
repudiate the idea.
EUSAPIA PALLADINO AND FRAUD.
By Hereward Carrington.
It is becoming daily more certain, I think, that psychical research
will win its due recognition only by the constant accumulation of
new facts, and not by the requotation of the old ones. Argument
as to past experiments yields but contradictory results (as we have
seen in the discussion of the Naples Report), and finally convinces
neither the one side nor the other. Sir WilHam Crookes has never
changed his views regarding Home's mediumship, nor did Sir Oliver
Lodge and the Continental observers alter theirs re Eusapia as a
result of the Cambridge exposure. After our Naples sittings, I
personally felt so far convinced that we had seen genuine phenomena
that I said to myself at the time :
" If Eusapia were caught cheating
at every seance from now until she dies, I should still believe that
we had seen genuine phenomena !
Since then, my faith has had ample opportunity to be tested
to be tried to the full. For during the American seances (at the
later ones particularly) Eusapia was caught in trickery repeatedly
and trickery of a character which renders it very evident that she
had practised it long, and had reached such a degree of adroitness
in it that detection —if not impossible to experts—was at least
extremelj^ difficult for any one not watching closely for the kind of
trickery practised. Prof. Miinsterberg alleged trickery at the seances
attended by him ; Mr. Dorr's were, to him, evidently not conclusive ;.
Dr. Stanley L. Krebs stated, in his article in the Journal S.P.E.,
that he had witnessed constant fraud ; while it is highly probable
that practically the whole of the seances attended by Messrs.
Jastrow, Davis and Rinn were fraudulent from beginning to end.
How, then, does this afiect the past evidence 1 And how, I might
perhaps be asked, does it affect my own point of view and belief
in Eusapia's powers ?
Speaking personallj', I may say at once that I remain precisely
where I was before these exposures took place. I admit her
trickery ; but then I bad always admitted it. And, in spite of
this, I feel more convinced than ever that genuine physical
phenomena occur through Eusapia's mediumship ; that our obser-
vations in Naples were not mistaken ; but that, on the contrary,
genuine phenomena were observed by us there too. Just as previous
experimenters have remained unaffected in their belief by later
exposures, so I, too, must record my continued conviction in the
reality of the majority of Eusapia's manifestations.
And the reason is this : although Eusapia does, unfortunately;
Oct., 1910. Etvscipia Polladino ami Fraud. 371
cheat whenever a chance is given her to do so, I have seen
phenomena which no conceivable form of trickery could explain
certainly no form of trickery that has been discovered in the past.
When I " think back " over the records, and remember certain
individual incidents that took place, either at Naples or in the
American series, I cannot help but think how wholly—even
grotesquely—inadequate any theory of trickerj' is, when applied to
these incidents. I do not base my faith upon dubious phenomena, but
upon those M'hich, in my estimation, are unquestionable. It is
highlv probable that, had I attended the third, fourth, fifth, seventh,
eighth and tenth seances in Naples onhj, I should have gone away
unconvinced of the reality of the facts. It is only a really good
seance which finally convinces ; and nothing else will. Knowing
this, I said in the circular letter I sent to members, before Eusapia's
arrival in the U.S. :
NOTES FOR SITTERS.
"It is important for all sitters to bear in mind the following
facts when attending seances with Eusapia Palladino :
" During the series, there will probably be good and bad sit-
tings. While good sittings are convincing, bad sittings will possibly
leave on the mind a suspicion that fraud may have been employed,
and on the whole will probably be unconvincing. It is therefore
essential to remember that if only one or two sittings are witnessed,'
and these happen to be bad sittings, no fair conclusion can be
drawn until at least one good seance be witnessed."
In spite of this warning (based on experience), however, what do
we find? All the principal informants against Eusapia in
America have published their formal accusations of trickery after
one, or at most two, seances !
^ The single exception is Mr. Dorr,
who had three.^ In this connection, I may remark that Mr. Dorr's
attitude strikes me as all the more extraordinary because, at these
sittings, both controllers (friends of Mr. Dorr) were convinced that
trickery had not been employed.
As to the seances attended by the group of scientific men at
Columbia University, these were so poor that no other result could
have been expected ; the only wonder is that they had the patience
to sit through four such sessions. To give an idea of the character of
these seances, I may mention the fact that hardly a single complete
levitation occurred in the best light ; and at some seances not a
single levitation, even in semi-darkness ! It is small wonder, then,
that the conclusion reached was contrary to the claims of Eusapia
it would be expecting too much of human nature to hope for any
other verdict.
^ Prof. Miinsterberg, two ; Prof. Jastrovv, one ; Dr. Krebs, two ; Messrs.
Davis, Piinn, Kellogg, and Sargent, two ; etc.
-The unfavourable report on Eusapia, published in Science of May 20th, 1910,
(see Journal for July) which is referred to by Mr. Carringtou in the next para-
graph, states that eight of the authors of the report were present at three
sittings, and several of them at a larger number ;
e.g. Professor Dickinson Miller
was present at nine sittings. Ed.
S72 Joiiomal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1910.
Those of us who believe in the possession by Eusapia of genuine
supernormal powers of a remarkable character, base our belief, not
on dubious phenomena (as I have said before), but on those in
which there could have been no question of trickery of the ordinary
kind. For myself, I remain convinced chiefl}' because of the fact
that I have repeatedl}' seen phenomena in light good enough to see
that Eusapia did not touch or approach the object moved, and that
no thread or other material attachment existed, connecting her body
and the table or the instrument played upon. These and these only
are, to my mind, phenomena of a conclusive character ; and I base
my belief on none other. But when once convinced that genuine
phenomena do occur under such conditions, is not one justified in
believing that other manifestations, similar in appearance, are genuine
also, but that they happen in darkness too great to allow of the
same exact observation being made 1
Taken all in all, I must contend that—at the lowest estimate—the
evidence stands just where it was before. Much fraud has been
discovered, it is true ; but there is some reason for this, and reason
to think, also, that those who have " exposed " Eusapia were some-
what too hasty and premature in their judgments. On the other
hand, an enormous amount of fresh evidence has been collected,
tending to show that these phenomena are genuine ; and this side
of the controversy has not yet been presented to the public. When
this newer evidence is published (as it will be, I hope, very
shortly), it will be found to present a far stronger case than has
been imagined for the genuineness of these manifestations, and will
.serve to indicate that, in spite of her petty trickery, Eusajjia is
possessed of a remarkable power, capable of moving physical objects
without contact, and of producing even more phenomenal occur-
rences ; and that this power is exhibited only on certain occasions,
and under certain conditions ;
failing which, Eusapia endeavours to
produce these phenomena, as best she can, by recourse to artful
and at times skilful trickery.

CASES.
G. 285. "Haunted" house.
The following accounts of apparitions seen independently in
the same house by several different persons were sent to us
by an Associate of the Society, the Rev. H. Northcote. The
real names of the witnesses were sent to us in confidence,
but the names of persons and places printed here are
assumed.
Mr. Northcote himself makes a preliminary statement as
follows :
Odoler 29th, 1909.
I am British chaplain in a small Continental town, having been
here nearly six years, while the Chelmsford family have been in
residence for about the same time. They are intimate friends of
myself and my family. They—especially the father, Mr. Walter
Chelmsford—are interested in psychic research. They are honourable
people, and their bona fides is beyond doubt.
In the winter of 1904-5 (or it might have been 1905-6) I was
having a talk with the eldest daughter of the family, Miss Gladys
Chelmsford, now Mrs. Rupert Chelmsford, having since married her
cousin. Miss Gladys Chelmsford suddenly asked me if I believed
in ghosts ; and I returned a rather guarded answer, admitting the
possibility of authentic apparitions. She then told me something
about having seen repeatedly the figure of a nun, when the family
were living in another European country some years before. She
added :
" And I see something at nights in our house here (Villa
Finisterre). It is something black that comes into my room in the
middle of the night and frightens me." She asked what I thought
it was. I said :
" Perhaps you have had a bad dream, and have
got into the way of expecting it again : and so your nerves get
highly strung and sensitive, and you imagine, when you are half
awake, that you see the thing again." I asked her if she was
quite wide awake when this occurred (she spoke of it as occurring
frequently) ; and she maintained that that was so. I said something
in the direction of discouraging her from thinking about the matter;
and the subject dropped, and she did not refer to it again.
I had almost forgotten the matter when, in the summer of 1908,
my wife came in one day from visiting the Chelmsfords. The
family had a guest at that time, a young lady whom I call Miss
Nov., 1910. Cases. 375
Denton, and who is now married to the eldest son, Mr. Herbert
Chehnsford. My wife said :
" Such a strange thing has happened
at Villa Finisterre. Miss Denton declares she has seen an appari-
tion. She saw it for several nights in succession, but wouldn't
speak of it, fearing that her own nerves were in disorder ; and
that this was the cause. One night Mrs. Chelmsford, who was
staying up late, heard Miss Denton cry out in a frightened voice :
'Go away'; and then the affair came out."
My wife told me this; and there came into my mind what Miss
Gladys Chelmsford had said to me three or four years before. I
vi^ent up to Villa Finisterre that day or the next, and asked the
Chelmsfords about the occiirrence. They gave the same account
and then I saw Miss Denton and the room where she had had
her experience. She said it happened in the small hours. She
had been asleep (I am not sure whether she had been asleep
every night or not), and then woke up and saw the apparition.
She seems to have distinguished it more clearly than Miss G.
Chelmsford had done. She said it was the figure of a tall man.
It used to come towards the bed ; then she would get frightened,
and the figure would disappear in the direction of a cupl^oard in
the wall.
I examined the room. The walls were boarded, and there is a
good space between the planking and the stone walls. The house
is old. In company with two of Mr. Chelmsford's sons I examined
the cupboard where the figure was said to disappear ; and by forcing
two boards asunder we managed to look into the empty space
between the lining and the wall. Nothing was visible ; and as this
was mere guesswork on our part, we did not examine further.
Our idea was that if the room was haunted, there might be
papers or something hidden away which would explain the
mystery.
The Chelmsfords gave Miss Denton the adjoining room ; and I
think she had a light in her room the next night. In those
circumstances she saw nothing; nor was the figure ever seen when
there was a light in the room. The following night, however,
sleeping without a light, she did see the figure again. This time
she was not alarmed. There is, in the room she now occupied, a
door communicating with the haunted room ; and the figure seemed
to disappear through this door.
Soon afterwards Miss Denton left, and I think the above-
mentioned occasion was the last on which she saw the figure. I
376 Jotirnal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1910.
asked her particularly whether any one had told her beforehand
about anything strange having been seen in the room. She says
not ; and all the Chelmsford family say the same.
No explanation of the affair is as yet forthcoming. Mrs. Herbert
Chelmsford is now living in this place ; bat has never slept at Villa
Finisterre since her strange experience. I have not heard that the
figure has been seen by any one during the whole of this year. I
have delayed writing about it, partly because I thought fresh evidence
might turn up.
Alter writing this account, Mr. Northcote obtained first-
hand statements from the various witnesses, as printed below
From Mrs. Rupert Chelmsford {nee Miss Gladys Chelmsford).
I am asked to relate the strange experiences I had in an old
house my parents rented abroad.
• It happened my bedroom was situated at the end of a long
passage and was the end room of the house. It was small and very
quaint, two of its walls were entirely panelled, and the other two
only half way, the unpanelled portion being covered with a yellow
material. The fireplace had been converted into a small cupboard,
and in one corner of the room there was a large deep cupboard
on the outside wall, in the panelling. The room possessed two
doors, one leading into a small dressing-room, and then on to the
passage ; the other was opposite the cupboard, and led into my
father's study. There was also a big window, between the cupboard
and door, which I always kept open.
It was in the spring of 1905 that we took possession of the
house, and the first night, being very tired, I went to bed early,
and fell asleep at once ; the next thing I remember was suddenly
sitting up in bed, with a sense of horror and fear upon me almost
beyond my control. I looked wildly round the room, which was
dark, and to my terror saw, what I naturally took to be a burglar,
quietly entering the room, by the door leading from the passage.
I sat still for a minute, being quite unable to move ; the figure
came round to my bedside, after standing at the foot, then it
seemed to fall on to its knees ; I wildly thought to hide under the
bed; so I took a jump as far as possible out into the room, so as
to miss him, and get help. On reaching the door, I looked back,
and could see nothing, so I stood and watched awhile, as I was
ashamed to go and rouse the house for nothing, perhaps.
Damp fear on my face began to cool, as I stood there, and
Nov., 1910. Cases. 377
growing bold, as nothing happened, I crept over the bottom of my
bed, to get at the candle, to light it. This I did, and all being
quite silent I took a good look round. There was nothing to be
seen, but the curious feeling of a strong presence with me in the
room. I felt I was being watched, and that the light was the only
safeguard between me and something horrible. I looked at my
watch : it was a quarter to 2. I got into bed, and sat there all
strained, listening and watching, painfully wide awake. The next
room clock struck 2, and suddenly I began to feel sleepy ; the
strain seemed to have snapped as it struck. I fell asleep, to wake
next morning with mj' candle burnt out beside me. Of course, I
tried to put it all down to nightmare, and said nothing about it.
But the next night the same thing happened, and this time I
woke. I quite lost my head in the great terror the thing inspired;
I ran down the passage to my parents' room. Of course nothing
was to be found, and it was put down, as is usual, to imagination or
nightmare. However, every night at the same time I went through
the same thing, and saw this tall dark figure, unless I had a light,
and even then strongly felt its presence until the hour of 2, when
a great peace seemed to fall over the night, and I got into the
habit of blowing my light out, and sleeping.
From Mrs. Herbert Chelmsford {n^e Miss Denton).
In September, 1908, I went to stay with Mr. and Mrs. Chelms-
ford at Villa Finisterre. I was in good health and excellent spirits
at the time, and had heard no mention of a ghost having been
seen in the house. On the evening of the day of my arrival I
went to bed rather late and slept very badly, continually waking
up with a most uncomfortable feeling, so much so that at last I
could endure the darkness no longer and lighted a candle, which I
left burning until daylight. I did not attach any importance to my
disturbed night, merely putting it down to being overtired and sleep-
ing in an unaccustomed bed. But the second night I slept no
better, and towards 2 o'clock I was very startled by seeing an
opaque mass of light at the foot of my bed. At first I thought it
must be light thrown from the window, but gradually I saw this
mass of light taking form—that of an extremely tall man (I should
say, about 6 ft. 2 in. in height), who, after standing quite still for
what seemed a very long time to me—though it was probably only
a few seconds—moved across the room and seemed to disappear
through a cupboard built into the wall. The third night the same
37S Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1910.
thing happened. By this time I was very alarmed, and the next
day asked if a dog might sleep in my room, as I had heard
nuises of mice in the room. My request was readily granted, and
I went to my bedroom feeling rather happier.
The dog was tucked up in a rug in a comfortahle chair, and was
soon asleep; but about 2 o'clock he sat up, and turned round and
round and whint-d. At the same time I saw my nocturnal visitor
again at the foot of my Ijed. I was so frightened that I called
out, "Go away." Mrs. Chelmsford, who was writing late in the next
room to my bedroom, heard me, and went to her husband and told
him she was afraid I was sleeping very badly, and suggested coming
into my room, but decided not to, as it might distuii) me. I did
not say anything about this to any one in the house at the time, as
I was afraid it might only be my imagination playing me tricks, and
I intended to endure it as long as I could ; but one night, about
ei.tjhteen days aftei' I had been there, the figure that came to my
bedside was completely illuminated, resembling— more than anything
else I can think of—tliose representations of people in fireworks, in
which all the features of the face and the principal lines of the
body are outlined in light. After this I felt too alarmed to sleep
in that room any longer, and the next day at breakfast I asked if
a ghost had' ever been seen there. I described what I had seen,
and my description tallied with that of an apparition seen by both
of Mr. and Mrs. Chelmsford's daughters. Needless to say I did
not sleep in that room again. Mrs. Clielmsford most kindly turned
a sitting-i'oom into a bedroom for me, as she said nothing had
been seen in it; and I used this room, always keeping a light
burning at night, and never seeing an} thing there until one night
when (having received a letter V)y the last post with news which
completely absorbed all my thoughts) I put out my light absent-
miniledly and went to sleep, waking up sudden!}' to see the
brilliantly lighted figure of the man at my bedside. After that I
always kept a light burning at night, and never saw the vision
again.
From Mrs. Clyde (ude Miss Dorothy Chelmsford).
I slept alone in tlie big bedroom at the top of the house. The
first night I slept there I had a dream that the room was haunted.
Later on, I awt)ke one night with a great sense of fear. I sat up
and looked all round me, and in the tar corner to the right of the
window I saw a dark figure crouching, and, as I gazed at it, it
got up slowly and came towaids me. 1 was so terrified that I hid
Nov., 1910. Oases. 379
my face in the pillow. I felt it standing by my side, just as if it
were leaning over me and touching me on the shoulder. I lay like
that for some time, and then I lit my candle, and kept it alight
for the rest of the night. I couldn't clearly define the figure. It
seemed to me a tall daik object. It might have been a very tall
woman or a man. The fact is, I was really too terrified to have
a good look at it. Well, after that night, for about a year I used
to wake up nearly every night at a certain hour with a feeling
that there was something in my room, until it got so on my nerves
that I was made to sleep with a lighted lamp in my room all
night. Even then, sometimes, I would wake up with a feeling of
fear, expecting something to happen, and in the far corner I would
hear a low tap, tap, tap, for a few seconds, and then it would
stop. So clear was it that the first time I heard it I thought it
was my mother tapping for me, as her room was under mine,
and I ran down at once to see if she wanted me. She was
sleeping.
About two years later my sister came up to sleep in the same
room with me. I slejjt in the same bed I always had, Avhich had
always been in the room, and she had another bed that was brought
up. Her bed was one side of the room, and mine the other. One
night I awoke, and I saw a dark tall object coming towards me. I
thought it was my sister walking in her sleep, as she did so some-
times, and I gave a shriek and hid my face in the bedclothes. Then
I heard my sister's voice from her bed, asking me what was the
matter. I told her I thought she was walking towards me in her
sleep ; but she had never moved from her bed, so it must have
been the same apparition that I saw the fiist time, and it came
from the same corner of the room.
As far as I can remember, there was no moonlight either of the
times I saw the apparition ; there was only the light of a clear
night. I cannot remember the dates when I saw the apparition.
Each time I woke suddenly from deep sleep with a great sense of
fear, as if something was going to happen. I only saw the appari-
tion twice, as I was married shortly after I saw it the second time
.and left home ; but all the time I slept in that room, I felt at night
as if there was something or some one there, which I could not
see. The tapping Sdund I heard more often. Sometimes I wouldn't
hear it for two or three months, and then one night I would wake
up feeling I was going to hear it again, and in the far corner I
would hear it tap, taj), tap, like some one tapping softly.

From Mr. Herbert Chelmsford.
During the month of August, 1908, whilst I was on a visit to
my parents at Villa Finisterre, I saw what I believe to have been
an apparition. Owing to the house being full, I shared a large
bedroom with one of my brothers, which was in the top storey.
One night I awoke suddenly, and, looking across the room, I
saw the cloaked figure of a man bending over my brother's bed. I
thought at first this might be a dream, and kept opening and
shutting my eyes to make sure. My brother's bed was situated
between the cross lights of two windows, and this enabled me to
make out the outline of a figure fairly clearly. The time was
between 2 and 3 a.m. I tried to call out to my brother, but was
C[uite unable to do so. I did not feel in any way nervous, but merely
curiously excited. My brother suddenly awoke, and said " Who's
that ?
" I tried to answer, but could not do so for at least ten
seconds, and then I asked him what was the matter. Before my
brother spoke the figure had cjuite disappeared. On discussing it
with him, he said he thought he had been hit by some one on his
side. We searched all round the room and found no sign of any
one or anything. My brother did not see the figure.
This is the only exjjerience of the sort I have had at Villa
Finisterre or elsewhere.
L. 1181. Apparition.
The following case of an apparition coinciding with a
dream was sent to us by an Associate of the Society, Mr.
J. H. Clapham, of King's College, Cambridge, who wrote
concerning it
Sept. 1, 1910.
Its main interest is that my appearance had no significance. I
was comfortably asleep in a Swiss inn. Fortunately my diary has
a note of the excellent night that I spent, and one of my com-
panions can also witness to what I said about it at breakfast. We
can also get the note in Mrs. Nicholson's diary mentioned in the
letter. . . .
Alison is our little girl aged 2^. . . .
J. H. Clapham.
P.S. —I do sometimes garden before breakfast.
Mr. Clapham sent us the original letter from his wife,
describing what had happened, as follows :
Nov., 1910. Cases. 381
55 Bateman Street,
Cambridge, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 1910.
What were you doing this morning between 5 a.m. and 5.15?
Such a strange thing happened. To the best of ni}- belief I was
awake, for I had just been putting some lotion on the restless [Alison]
and heard 5 o'clock strike. I turned round to face the window,
to try and get off to sleep, and there were you standing by the
bed looking down on me. I said " John, what are you doing licre ?
but you said nothing, and walking round the bed you bent over
Alison's cot and looked at her, and she stirred restlessly in her
sleep and said "Daddy, Daddy, I can't 'member." Then you came
round and looked at me again, and by that time I was terrified, for
I thought something must have happened to you. I said " What
have you come for 1 " and tried to touch you, but you retreated
towards the window and disappeared. At that moment Alison woke
and popped lier head over her cot. I gave her her biscuit and
looked at the clock ; it was 5.15. I comforted myself by reflecting
that you could hardly have begun to climb yet, but I haven't felt
comfortable all day. When Alison came into my bed, she said
"Daddy was mowing the grass when I waked up." I told her
you were away in Switzerland and not mowing the grass, but she-
said "I know he was mowing the grass, 'cause I seed him." And
again at breakfast, in the middle of demanding sugar, .she suddenly
said "I know Daddy was mowing, I seed him doing it when I
waked up." So if I was dreaming, she must also have been dreaming
of you at the same time. I went up to Mrs. Nicholson after
breakfast and told her, and she is going to write it down in her
diary. . . .
Ou this letter Mr. Clapham had noted
Received Brieg—Tues., Aug. 9, 1910.—J. H. C.
Mr. Clapham sent us the diary that he was keeping in
Switzerland at the time to show his contemporary doings. From
this we extract the relevant entries as follows :
Something after 6.0 [p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 2] we came to
Goschenen and put up . . . at the White Little Horse. . . .
Wed. Aug. 3. There was a furious rain overnight, but the
morning came fine, though not clear. . . . After an excellent night
all were fresh and keen. . . .
Tues. Aug. 9. . . . Here [at Brieg] came news of my phantasmal
doings.
382 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1910.
Mrs. Nicholson, the lady whom Mrs. Clapham had told
of her experience at the time, sent her the following state-
ment about it, which she forwarded to us :
12 Harvey Road, Cambridge, Oct. 25, 1910.
Dear Mrs. Clapham,
With reference to your experience, I find this in my diary
for Wednesday, August 3 :
" Mrs. C. called ; she had '
seen '
her husband this morning, when she
waked, about 5. He came to the side of the bed, she tried to touch
him, and was about to say, '
Oh, you're coming to bed;' he then went
to the side of Alison's cot, and bent over her. She tossed in her sleep
and said, '
I don't bemember, Daddy.' He returned again to the side
of the bed ; Mrs. C. (I think) again tried to touch him. Then he went
to the window, away. She found it was \ past 5. Alison woke then,
for good ; and said later :
'
When I waked this morning Daddy was
mowing the lawn.' Mrs. C. said: 'No; Daddy's in Switzerland.'
Mr. C. was to arrive at his destination in Switzerland last night; he
went there on Monday. She said : 'I've come to tell you, as ... if I
find that anything happened then, you'll l)ear witness.'" . . .
Cecilia Nicholson.
Mrs. Clapham, in sending us this letter, writes:
55 Bateman Street, Cambridge, Oct. 28, 1910.
... I notice [Mrs. Nicholson] says I was about to say " Oh, you're
coming to bed " to my husband, which is incorrect, for, knowing him to
be away, it never occurred to me that he was coming to bed, only that
his party had broken up for some reason, and that he had come home
unexpectedly. I believe I said :
" What lias brought you back 1 " or
something similar, but the exact words are in the letter I wrote to my
husband, which I believe you have. ... I have never seen any
apparition of my husband before. I was rather anxious aljout him this
year, as the weather conditions were unusually bad for climbing, and I
knew, too, that his party were going guideless across country. . . .

L. 1182. Impression.
In the following case all the names and addresses of the persons
concerned were given to us in confidence, with the request
not to print them. The account was sent by Mr. M. L.,
Nov., 1910. Gases. 383
with whom the Secretary has had several opportunities of
talking; it over.
Tith Sept., 1910.
I want to lay before your Society a set of strange cii'cumstances,
wliich may interest you. . . . My original letter, which T am copying,
was written on the 1.3th inst. . . .
As a boy I went to see my grandfather at P. very frequently ;
he died in '88, and amongst my lecoUections was an oblong
whitewood box with six grooved compartments on each side,
in which I used to put various aiticles, and coloured sands,
and to play with it generally. Many years later, I asked my
sister what became of it. Slie told me it had never existed: it had
been a dream. But it was the greatest reality I had.
In November of last year my old fiiend, Q,., and I were using
the planchette, at which he is remarkably adept. We asked what
the box signified. Tliere was another man present previous to our
enquiring these lad details. The planchette then evolved a [a-etty
tale of two Cornish friends, wlio were drowned and were animating
the instmment, and wou'd not work except through me. I enclose
the origirial records, as well as a copy of the answers j it stated
twelve periods of my life, as the meaning of the box. The
twelfth it WDuhl not reveal. It was to come in May of this
year ('May' was a conscious act of my will). It said I shotdd go
to St. Valery, there meet my greatest friend, Count Louis de
Mericourt, engage with him in conversation on phihisophy and other
things, and disa|)i)ear and be swallowed up in tlie quicksands. And
throughout it i sisted on 'on tlie sands.'
This queer dream-cerebration I dismissed. It was the usual kind
of thing, only better.
i This year I had not intended to go anywhere, as I had no one
to go with, and no inclination. A friend, H. T., suddenly offered
to go to Brussels. We had settled on ever\ thing, when the British
Section was Imrnt down. Then we decided to go somewhere—
did not care "here; he suggested Dieppe, I agreed. We went to
Dieppe on Aug. 23. We got tired of Dieppe, and wanted to move
on to sometiiing smaller. He suggested St. Valery-en-Caux, I urged
feeble arguments, he in>^iste<l. We settled on Tues., Aug. 30th, to
leave. All this while, 1, ot cour.-e, t-aid nothing ot the queer trend
of events. That night a cyclist, iioing on to Boulogne, dined at
the hotel. He told me o\ tiie ffyiug at Havre and altered my
intentions.
384 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1910.
In my room, I told T. I wanted to go to Havre, and then of
the strange forecasts connected with St. Valery. To my surprise
he was not sceptical, and, with some reluctance, told me that on
the sands he had had a waking vision, in which he had seen
me and a bearded Frenchman (whom he described exactly) have
a struggle on the sands and disappear. He tried to intervene
with robust common sense, rushed after us ; but we had vanished.
The whole scene of the Plancheite had been telejiathed to him. He
woke up expecting to see me. I had hardly informed any one of
the forecast, and least of all him. He also said he was set^
piqued, on going to St. Valery, and nothing but the flying, and my
wish for it, would have deterred him.
Next day we parted and did not meet again until the 13th Sept.
in London.
On the 13th he called on me. He tells me he went to Fecamp,
Etretat, and St. Valery. Despite the conformation of the coast^
there are quicksands at St. Valery, and nowhere else apparently
on that coast.
I knew nothing of the place, had never been there or heard of
it ;
having maps of Normandy, I may have seen the name.
M. L.
Mr. L. sent us the original Planchette writings, with the
following abstract by himself of the chief points in the
particular incident referred to

to die similarly.

He will have most effect on your life.
Mr. L. sent us also the following letters addressed to him-
self from his two friends, Q. and H. T., in corroboration of
his account
Sept. 27th, 1910.
I remember very well the occasion to which you refer. As far
as I recollect the events took place, as you say, early ia
Nov., 1910. Gases.
November (or late in October) last year. We were operating with
the " planchette " together. During the earlier part of the evening
a friend of yours (whose name I forget) was present, but I think
he had left before the answers referring to St. Valery and to
your future friendship with "Louis de Mericourt " occurred. The
abstract of these answers which you send me corresponds exactly
with my own recollection.
I may add, as far as I am concerned, that I had stayed myself
at St. Valery-en-Caux some time before the evening in question, but
had no idea that there were any quicksands there. The name
of "Louis de Mericourt" I am pretty confident I had never heard
before. Q.
lifh Sep., 1910.
Having been privileged to read your letter which sets out this
extraordinary conjunction of anticipations and after-events connected
with our recent trip to Normandy I am able to confirm the relation
of incidents, so far as I was a party to them.
Pressure of business prevents me giving, as I had intended, my
own version of events ; but I feel this is now, in any case, un-
necessary, in view of your detailed narrative.
H. T.
In reply to further questions from us, Mr. H. T. stated
definitely that he had heard nothing of the planchette state-
ments before his experience and that he did not know Mr. Q.
personally ;
and sent us later the following account of his
recollections of the whole matter
•25fh Oct., 1910.
I am glad to be of any assistance I can in a matter in which my
friend Mr. L. takes an interest, but incidents of the character
described in his letter to you make so little impression on me
that if it were not for his recalling them to my mind, I am afraid
I should by now have forgotten all about them. You will readily
gather from this fact of temperament with what hesitation I attempt
any statement of the details of the incident in which I was con-
cerned.
On, I think it was, the 30th August last, when sitting on the
sands at Dieppe, I closed my eyes for a few minutes in the
endeavour to get more complete rest by shutting out at the same
time visual impressions and mental perceptions of facts of any kind.
After being a few minutes in this condition, I fancied I saw my
386 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov.. 1910.
friend Mr. L., whom I. had shortly before left at the hotel, engaged
in a tussle, whether friendly or not I could not distinguish, on the
sands with a stranger whom I did not recognise. I roused myself
to go towards them, and both disappeared as if through the sand.
I thought no more of the illusion until late the same night when
something led to Mr. L. telling me the story of the planchette
of which I had not heard before. Upon this, I said that friend
of his might have been the person I saw him struggling with as
I sat half asleep on the sand. Fresh as the thing then was in
my mind, I replied to his queries in so far as I felt able to dis-
tinguish between fact and illusion, and I have sufficient confidence
in his powers of accurate retention and reproduction of facts to
warrant me in saying that his version of the matter is reliable.
H. T.
DOES EUSAPIA TRICK UNCONSCIOUSLY?
The Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research for
August, 1910, contains a detailed and instructive report by
Mr. W. S. Davis of two sittings with Eusapia, held on
April l7th and 24th, 1910, at the house of Professor Lord,
of Columbia University. Professor Jastrow's brief account of
these sittings was quoted in our Journal for July (pp. 335-342),
and we would recommend those of our readers who are interested
in the details of the case to study Mr. Davis's article.
Another of the sitters concerned in the exposure, Mr. James
L. Kellogg, writes to us to supplement Mr. Davis's report as
follows :
New York, July \5ih, 1910.
He discusses the question from the viewpoint of conscious
imposture, whereas a number of students consider Eusapia a hysteric
and an irresponsible person. We all consider her a conscious
trickster, for the following reasons : When she entered Professor
Lord's house from the street, she greeted us cordially, shook hands
with us, talked with us in a most sensible and businesslike way,
thiough an interpreter, Mr. Livingston, and was in a perfectly
normal condition. I called her attention to a table we had which
was of approximately the same dimensions as her own, but which
had a top of one inch boards instead of one-half inch, as had the
Nov., 1910. Does Eusapia Trick Unconsciously ? 387
table she brought with her in the automobile. She took my hand
and led me to her table, rapped it on the top and it resounded
something like a drum. She then led me back to the table we had
offered and rapped on this, showing that it had a much deader
sound. This, and all the other things which she did, indicated
that she was exceedingly conscious and knew exactly what she was
doing. While in full possession of her mental faculties she took
her seat at the seance table, and when we also were seated she
deliberately proceeded to secure certain reprehensible advantages
which were to facilitate all the trickery which was to follow. She
laid her plans to deceive us within a very few minutes after she
entered the house and before there were any pretensions of hysteria
or trance. "Jockeying" for the foot substitution was one of the
first things Eusapia did, and she certainly knew what she was doing
it for. The " phenomena " which occurred later, when she was in
the so-called hysterical condition, were all dependent upon traps
which she set shortly after she entered the house. Her preliminary
manoeuvring while in her normal condition not only required skill,
but she was cautious in making up her mind whether it would be
safe to proceed with the "phenomena," as was shown by the way
she questioned us in order to discover whether we were likely to
seriously interfere with her methods.
The production of "phenomena" ran on smoothly on the two
occasions mentioned for over an hour without any indication of an
abnormal condition, and not until after the lights were lowered did
she feign hysteria.
Her table is built exclusively for trick purposes. The weight,
length, breadth, depth, etc., must be in accordance with her specifi-
cations, and the whole thing is devised for the very tricks which
she performs. In fact, it would be rather ruinous to her perform-
ance to use a table of any other make, and this table is demanded
by Eusapia when she is engaged and when she knows what she is
doing and when she is full of business shrewdness. Likewise the
curtains are demanded at the same time, and she certainly knows
what she proposes to do with them.
Again, trance and hysteria usually constitute a part of the stock
in trade of all physical mediums, and I see no reason why we
should assume genuineness in the case of Eusapia and only pre-
tence in others.
I purposely managed to feel Eusapia's wrist several times through-
out the evening, and often could distinctly feel the pulse beat. I
388 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., i9io.
could not detect the slightest acceleration or nervousness on her
part, and I doubt if there was a person in the room who had
cooler nerves or was more self-possessed than the performer who
was entertaining us.
Another point is this : Those here who accept Eusapia, insist
that we should not have permitted her to perpetrate fraud, for we
could have obtained genuine phenomena had we demanded them.
The fact that we had another seance a week later, when we did
not allow her to perpetrate fraud, makes no impression upon their
minds. Moreover, Prof Miller states that at seances previously
attended by him he noticed that the volume of phenomena appeared
to depend upon the amount of liberty which Eusapia was able to
secure, and that when she was held in check, manifestations pro-
portionately lessened.
I also want to make it clear that we did not deliberately invite
fraud at the seance of April 17. We simply obeyed Eusapia and
accepted the conditions imposed upon us. It .should also be noted
that at the second seance we were exceedingly gentle with the
medium, and made it a special point not to give her any excuse
for claiming that we were severe. All of the ladies and gentlemen
in our party will testify that we merely replaced Eusapia's hand
and foot whenever she undertook to secretly slip either away.
Our seances were preceded by eight others, which were attended
by Prof. Miller, and no evidence of anything supernormal was
obtained, though a veiy great amount of evidence of imposture was
secured. In addition to these evidences of actual fraud, it was also
clearly shown that as to her "hysteria," she had a perfect know-
ledge of all that transpired while under its influence, and she seldom
loses an opportunity to make every point count in her favor. . . .
She also makes careful preparation, as outlined above, for her
trickery when she is in her normal mental condition, even though
the phenomena may not be presented until her professed hysteria.
In view of all the facts, I think that Prof Jastrow's rather
severe article on Palladino in the American Review of Beviews for
July, 1910, was entirely logical, and hence justifiable. . . .

PEIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBEES AND ASSOCIATES.
The 33rd Private Meeting of the Society for Members and
Associates only was held at Morley Hall, George Street,
Hanover Square, London, W., on Tuesday, November 8th, 1910,
at 4 p.m. ; the President, Mr. H. Arthur Smith, in the chair.
The President delivered a short Commemorative Address
and papers were read by Mrs. Henry Sidgwick and Mr. W.
M'DouGALL on Frank Podmore and William James, which
will be published later in full in the Proceedings.
EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TEANSFERENCE.
In this series of experiments the telepathic agent was Miss
Hermione Ramsden, an Associate of the Society, who has on
several previous occasions taken part in similar experiments
(see Proc. S.P.R. Vol. XXI. p. 60 and Jour. Vol. XIII. p. 243);
the percipient was Miss Tamara Statkowski, who is also an
Associate. Both agent and percipient were in England during
the whole course of the experiments, which extended from
September 8, 1908, to December 12, 1908. The method
followed was the same as in the experiments made by Miss
Miles and Miss Ramsden.^ The day was fixed but not the
exact time. The percipient agreed to receive impressions at
7 p.m., or later, should she be interrupted ; but the agent writes
that she was to " send the message at any hour—preferably in
the late afternoon—when I happened to see something of
sufficiently striking interest to impress inc. This we have always
found to be an important point." Both agent and percipient
recorded their- impressions on post-cards, which each sent to the
other on the day of the experiment, and which are now in
our possession. The date of these impressions is thus attested
by the post-mark. On several occasions Miss Eamsden used
a picture post-card, and tried to convey the scene on it to Miss
Statkowski, also recording on it any special points that struck
her. Eleven experiments were made,, in six of which some
success was obtained.
The agent's original post-cards are marked throughout (a),
the percipient's (&) ;
subsequent comments by the agent are
marked (c). All editorial comments are in large type.

. . . [several vague impressions] two towers between them
the high curve of a bridge with a landscape inside framed
in between the two towers and the curve, a large tree and
water . . . mediaeval looking. Tamara Statkowski.
Miss Statkowski knew that Miss Eamsden was at Corfe
Castle and this perhaps suggested the towers. In her subsequent
note on this experiment Miss Eamsden says :
" It [Corfe Castle]
was once a square tower which has been rent in two ; from
where I sat it looked like two towers." '^
In the neighbourhood
of the castle there are trees and water, and from one aspect the
gateway resembles " the high curve of a bridge," but there is no
landscape " framed in between the two towers and the curve."

Eushmore, Salisbury.
After tea I sat for a long time thinking of you as I looked
at this temple.^ There was a statue of Japanese stone on an
island in the pond. There were many impressions, several
temples, one with a statue of Buddha over doorway, but this
was the prettiest of all seen through a vista in the trees.

Big pink clouds. A wild landscape of high mountains. Fir-
tree in front.i Rush of waters, cascade or the fall of a river,
rocks and the eagle again. A girl in white muslin frock
with dark hair down her back. Tamara Statkowski.
It will be seen that there is a general resemblance between
the two impressions here recorded, although many of the details
are discrepant. The landscape seen by Miss Eamsden was
not " wild " ; there was water, but no " rush of waters " or
" cascade," and no " high mountains." The point of most
interest is the allusion by Miss Statkowski to " a big bird with
outspread wings, sitting on a stone, like an eagle," a conspicuous
object in the view seen by Miss Eamsden being two storks
on a stone island. On the other hand the wings of the storks
are not " outspread," and there is no resemblance between a
stork and an eagle beyond the fact that each is " a big bird."
Experiment IV.
(a) Sunday, Sept. 13th, 1908. Posted 14th.
Rushmore, Salisbury.
A distant view from a high common, low blue hills in the
distance. Remains of an old Roman village, only mounds of
earth to be seen and deep holes fenced in.
Some horses in a field came up to be patted and talked to.
There were pink clouds at sunset.

Very unsatisfactory.
Something very pale, whitish blue like a streak of moonlight.
Changed into a silvery, pale blue, silk dress. Clouds or rather
very thick smoke, clustering white and grey. A barn with
trees on some high ground behind. Nothing more.

There was a barn and some cottages and trees on the
common. Carriage wrong.
The only clear and correct impression received by Miss
Statkowski on this occasion vpas one not intentionally trans-
mitted by Miss Eamsden. As to the other impressions there
is again a general resemblance,—" clouds or rather very thick
smoke," and "a barn with trees on some high ground," on one
side and on the other " low blue hills in the distance," " pink
clouds," and " a barn, some cottages and trees."

and the skulls of ancient Romans, dug up near here.
Also some carved figures and a great deal of pottery.

There were some flower beds in front of the Museum.
Room 8 has glass windows the whole way along the side,
which give it the appearance of a green house ; at first I
thought it was one. In one of the rooms there is a statue
^ In reply to a question as to whether Miss Statkowski knew anything of
this dress, Miss Ramsden writes: "I do not think that Miss Statkowski and
I had ever seen each other in evening dresses before Sept. 26, 1908. ... I
•did not possess that particular dress the year I met her in Rome (1905). . .

of an Egyptian, also a mummy. There are relics from all

parts of the world, the object being to compare the primitive
races of all countries with the ancient Britons and Romans.
Here we have on one side a museum containing " pottery
and relics connected with " the primitive races of all countries,"
and on the other " a glass house," " empty flower pots," and
"some sort of savages." Of the particular object of which
Miss Eamsden wished to transmit an impression, i.e. a skull,
there is no trace.
At this time a change was made in the method of con-
ducting the experiments, which Miss Eamsden describes as
follows :
" When Miss Statkowski returned to London, she
wrote to tell me that the morning was the only time when
she could be sure of not being disturbed, and to this I replied
that I would try sending ideas from pictures and books, and
would try to keep exactly to the hour fixed on. This proved
very successful {vide Tyrol and the Buffalo) so long as I
had the object before my eyes, but when I tried reading over
a favourite poem it was a complete failure, although I fancied
I had a clear picture of it in my mind."

In the picture referred to by Miss Ranisden there are a
large number of buffaloes and also some deer. On the ground
near the front of the picture are skulls and horns of buffaloes-
looking like hunting trophies. There is no wall in the
picture ; otherwise Miss Statkowski's impression is very accurate.
The first thing she mentions is " a bull in a field—a frightful
one," and Miss Eamsden says, " Tlie '
Buffalo is the chief
thing."

blouse is gathering flowers.

First a black umbrella and pair of goloshes.
Then a wooden cross like this near a road.
A white building at the back like a chapel
with a white bell tower. Like one sees in
Tyrol. Changed into a large wliite building
with one beautifully carved Gothic window.
(c) [Note by Miss Eamsden.]
I did not know that Miss Statkowski had ever been in
Tyrol, but the wooden cross or wayside shrine which she
describes is closely connected with the Tyrol in my mind,
as there are many of them at Berchtesgaden where I have
been.
The only part of MacWhirter's picture of which Miss
Statkowski got any impression was the church, which is chiefly
noticeable for its high white campanile (cf. " white bell tower ").
With this exception it seems to have been the idea of the
Tyrol that Miss Statkowski received. Of the actual picture-
as a whole she got no impression.

Experiment XI.
•
(a) December 12.
A failure.
After this the experiments were interrupted for a considerable
time. They were resumed for a few weeks in August, 1909,
but with little success. In the course of the eleven experi-
ments described above, one incident occurred which is worth
-noting.
On September 11, 1908, Miss Eamsden sent no message,
ibut Miss Statkowski " sat " for impressions.
{h) 11th Sept.
Westerham, Kent.
An arch with a statue in it.
The arch changed into an arched sort of cloister, Italian,
viewed en perspective, with little columns to the right, where
there was a walled-in square garden with grass. A niche
with a statue in it, statue of Roman Emperor, full figure, in
armour, with wreath of laurels on his head, right arm stretched
out holding a spear. Very clear and persistent the Emperor.
A little girl in an apron with a white kerchief over her head
and a broom in her hand. A sweet face rosy and white, a
girl's with a plait of hair put all round her head. Somebody
on a bed turned into a square mediaeval tomb, with lying
statue on it. Low arch above and frescoes above the arch. A
very low stumpy palm-tree—changed into a bush in the same
square walled-in garden seen at first.
A man's head with big white curly wig—something like
Louis XIV. ... on his portraits. A woman's neck with thin
black velvet round it, with a bow at the back, Watteau
costume.
T. Statkowski.
{c) [Note by Miss Ramsden.]
I arrived at Rushmore 6 p.m. [on Sept. 11th] and drove
close to this temple,^ when the thought crossed my mind
' The temple, as shown in a print sent to us by Miss Ramsden, is round
with a domed roof supported on pillars and steps below. Between each of
the pillars is a "low stumpy palm" in a pot. In front of the temple is a
statue of the Emperor Augustus ; he is standing and holds a rod in his left
hand ; his right hand is outstretched. His head is bare and he is wearing
a breast-plate. Ed.
Dec, 1910. Experiments in TlLought-Transference. 399
" that would be a good subject for telepathy. I will try it
to-morrow!"^ I saw the statue of the Eoman Emperor in
the distance, from behind, but did not notice it and did not
discover the likeness to this [i.e. Miss Statkowski's] descrip-
tion until the 13th. The garden here is square with a hedge
round it, but I had spent the whole morning in a " walled-in
square garden with grass " at Morton's House, Corfe Castle :
there was a little 2;irl aged six but she had no white kerchief
or broom. At Rushraore there was a girl as described. The
rest is wrong.
In this case it appears that in identifying the statue as a
Eoman Emperor, Miss Statkowski went beyond what was con-
sciously known to Miss Eamsden at the time. The points
upon which the description of the statue is correct are
(1) The figure represents a Eoman Emperor.
(2) It is " a full figure in armour," i.e. wearing a breast
plate.
(3) The right arm is outstretched.
The description is incorrect in the following particulars
(1) The statue is in the open, not in a niche or arch.
(2) The Emperor holds a staff not a spear, in his left not
his right hand.
(3) He has no wreath.
Several of the other points noted by Miss Statkowski suggest
confused impressions of the two places visited by Miss Eamsden
on September 11th. The "arched sort of cloister" may have
been suggested by the pillars of the temple.
It will be noticed that sometimes in these experiments, as
in those of Miss Miles and Miss Eamsden, the impression
received by the percipient, although in some way connected
with the agent, is not that which she endeavoured to transmit
{vide, e.g. Experiment IV.). The series is not sufficiently long
for it to be possible to draw any conclusions as to the kind
of impressions most easily transmitted. In some cases it seems
to have been a visual image that was transferred and in some
an idea.
1 Miss Rainsden did not carry out this intention, but tried next day to
transfer a different impression. (See Expt. III.). —Ed.

A DISCUSSION OF CROSS-CORRESPONDENCES.i
[To THE Editoii of THE Spectator.']
Sir, —In a review of Mr. Podmore's book, The Newer S2nritualis7n,
which, under the title " The Progress of Psychical Research,"
appeared in your issue of October 15th, the writer speaks of "the
almost universal assumption that cross-correspondences are among
the best evidence in support of" the hypothesis that "the spirit of
Frederic Myers is communicating with us through various auto-
matists."
Since he seems to regard only their form, I am not surprised that
your reviewer does not share this "almost universal assumption."
The theory in regard to cross-correspondences to which he seems to
be alluding was first put forward in June, 1908 (S. P.R. Proceedings,
Part LV.), by Miss Alice Johnson. She neither then nor subse-
quently suggested that the form of cross-correspondences can supply
evidence for identity ; nor has any other responsible member of
the Society for Psychical Research made the suggestion. Your
reviewer later on remarks
" Even if such things [i.e. cross-correspondences of a complex type]
were common, might it not be argued that they would only prove
that some conscious being was producing them ; that they would
scarcely prove that the conscious being was '
in the spirit ; that
they would certainly not prove that he was the particular dead
person that he claimed to be ? A cross-correspondence is a possible
proof of organisation, not of identity."
Now, if the form only of cross-correspondences is taken into
account, I for one should be ready to answer your reviewer's three
questions in the affirmative, and to subscribe to his statement, though
rather awkwardly expressed, that a cross-correspondence is not a
proof of identity. The utmost that the fonn of a cross-correspondence
of the complex type can do is to furnish evidence of design. It
cannot reveal whose the design is. Nevertheless, the fact that the
form of cross-correspondences can reveal design may have a bearing
on the evidence for survival. It has been urged against all the
evidence for survival obtained before cross-correspondences began that
it consists merely of facts once known to the individual of whose
identity proof is being sought, and that this kind of evidence, v\^hile
it may prove the survival of a nucleus of memories, cannot prove
1 Re-printed fcom the Spectator of Nov. 5tli, 1910, by tlie kind permission
of the Editor.
Dec, 1910. A Discussion of Cross-Correspondences. 401
the survival of personality, in the sense, that is, of a still active,
living intelligence. But if—which remains of course to be proved
—the complex cross-correspondences are the work of spirits, then
this objection is met; for the design exemplified in .them cannot
proceed from a mere surviving nucleus of memories.
The strongest evidence of the older kind is to be found in the
•"G.P." communications in Mrs. Piper's trance. "G.P." confined
himself—a few trifling exceptions apart—to reciting past facts known
to the real "G.P." The "spirits" who call themselves Frederic
Myers, Richard Hodgson, and so on, have not only communicated
past facts known to the real men, but have improved on "G.P.'s"
method by initiating and repeatedly eff'ecting complex cross-corre-
spondences, the form of which suggests design, and accordingly active
intelligence in the present. But though the form of the cross-
•correspondences may be evidence of an active intelligence, it afi'ords
no evidence, positive or negative, of the identity of that intelligence.
This kind of evidence may, however, be aff'orded by the content of
cross-correspondences, an element of them which your reviewer has
either ignored or failed to observe. Negativelj^, the content, if it
•cannot prove, may render it highly probable that the mind which
•originated and gave it expression is not the mind of any one of the
automatists concerned in its production. I mean that if, for instance,
the subject-matter of the cross-correspondence, or the idea under-
lying it, is unknown to all the automatists, it follows that not they,
but some other mind external to them must have originated it.
Positively, the content of a series of cross-correspondences might
-afford evidence (I do not sa}' "proof") of the identity of this
external mind. How it might do so it would be impossible to explain
without the limits of a letter. I can only cite as an illustrative hint
the way in which " internal evidence " has served to reveal the
identity of an anonymous or pseudonymous author, to confirm or
confute the claims of a reputed author, or to expose the pretensions
of a forger. A series of complex cross-correspondences might, then,
I maintain, by their form suggest design and present activity, and
by their content identify their author. I cannot, therefore, agree
with your reviewer when he says that " a cross-correspondence is a
possible proof of organisation, not of identity"; nor when he says
that " all the experiments in cross-correspondence would seem to
have been irrelevant."
I am not claiming that any of the cross-correspondences have
furnished proof of identity. (For one thing, I do not know, and
402 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, i9io.
no one does, what would constitute proof of identity. Your re-
viewer's suggestion that before experimenting we ought first to
have decided this baffling problem strikes me as rather naive.) I
am only claiming that they might afford fairly strong presumptive
evidence of identity and of surviving active intelligence. As a
matter of fact, I do not believe that reasonable certainty will ever
be reached by trusting to any one line of experiment or observa-
tion. Many different lines will have to be pursued, and satisfactory
proof of survival will follow only if they all, or most of them, are
found to converge and lead to the same conclusion. —I am, Sir, etc.
J. G. PiDDINGTON.
[Our reviewer writes:—"I cannot think that my 'rather naive'
suggestion was entirely wasted, since it has extracted from Mr.
Piddington this most interesting letter. I asked for a discussion
as to what kind of evidence was valid in helping to establish any
hypothesis that was put forward. Mr. Piddington's letter is an
example of just such a discussion. He points out one kind of evidence
that is valid in helping to establish the hyj^othesis that the spirit
of Frederic Myers is communicating Avith us. But these arguments
are capable of immense extension and elaboration ; and my point
was that they are likely to be of very great help to us in judging
the experiments that have already been made and in arranging those
that are to be made in the future." Ed. Spectator.]
REVIEW.
Psychotherapy. By Hugo Munsterberg, Professor of Psychology in
Harvard University. T. Fisher Unwin, London, 1909. 401 pp.
8s. 6d. net.
This is one of the rapid stream of volumes now pouring from the
pen of Dr. Munsterberg in which he seeks to popularise and to
apply the principles and results of modern psychology. It contains
much sound and serviceable doctrine, but from the point of view of
" Psychical Research " it is of little interest, for the author's attitude
towards all its problems is one of dogmatic negation. The events with
which "Psychical Research" is concerned cannot happen, because they
are incompatible with "modern scientific psychology"; and they are
incompatible with it because "modern scientific psychology" is strictly
mechanistic, and explains all mental process in terms of the mechanics
of the brain.
Dkc, 1910. Bevievj.
All this dogmatism about " modern scientific psj'chology " is laid
down as universally accepted doctrine, whereas it depends on philo-
sophical doctrines which are peculiar to Dr. Miinsterberg ; and we
think that in a popular work this should have been made clear. How
unsatisfactory the author's conception of "scientific psychology" is, he
has himself abundantly demonstrated ; for, after showing in two large
volumes that, according to his conception of it, it can have no bearing
whatever upon the realities of human life, he has published a stream
of books showing its bearings upon education, medicine, and the
various great departments of human activity. It may therefore be
hoped that Professor Miinsterberg will display the same inconsistency
as regards "Psychical Eesearch," and that at some future date the
S.P.E. will be able to claim him as one of its brightest ornaments, —
hope which is further justified by the fact that he has already, with
an amiable weakness, taken part in sittings with Eusapia Palladino.
While that happy consummation still lies in the future, we may at
least congratulate Professor Miinsterberg on the fact that his
psychological activity refuses to be confined within the narrow and
sterile limits prescribed for " modern scientific psychology " by his
epistemological reflections. -.y atiT)
