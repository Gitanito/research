            Experience Description :   

  I was taking medication for illness and was put on a different medication which reacted badly with me. I remember falling down on the floor (I had a lady visiting me at the time thankfully she phoned the ambulance) I remember my friend saying I looked grey in the face. I can remember feeling peaceful not scared. All of a sudden in my mind from left to right like an 'Imax' movie, I saw all the very important moments of my life up to that present time. Most of the earlier moments in my life that came up I had long forgotten about until this happened. I had mixed feelings about this but mostly was peaceful. I then awoke at the hospital where I was told I had a bad allergic reaction to the medication I had been prescribed.
