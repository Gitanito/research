to ftep forward once more, to give a tranOa-

able work, PLACIDUS DE TITUS or.
/ :ELEMENTARY PHILOSOPHY.
This part contains a literal rranflation of
Thirty Remarkable Nativities, of fame of the
1noft eminent characters in Europe, gathered
by the Author in his life-time; not picked on
purpofe to eftablifh a falfe thefis; but taken as

they came regularly to his hand ; from which
he has proved the validity of thofe Canons
advanced in the prior part of this work.
The hiftory of our author informs us, he
was an Italian monk, an inhabitant of Bo-
logna; bleffed with uncommon genius, of
ftrong i1naginationand quick fancy, as well
as a great fearcher into the abftrufe fecrets of
nature : his patient exertion and continued
obfervations, enabled him to prefent to his
country a work in Elementary Philofophy,
far fuperior to any then extant.
So curioos and valuable a treafure it is
efteemed in our day, that fifty guineas have
been refufed for the original copy.
It is to this book we are beholden for
thofe many fhrew? remarks made in two of
the beft aftral books in the Englifh' language,
the Qpus REFORMATUM, and DEFECTio GE-.
NITURARuM, publilhed by the imm6rtal
Partridge, who was certainly the greateft

Surely nothing can be a greater argument
of the ftupidity of the age, when 1nen, con-

That thefe fweets may flimulate the lovers
of wifdmn to the fame ardent defire of being

ambition to promulgate the infallibilitr of that

THERE is nothing by which man ever,
arrived at a more perfect knowledge o(
the fecrets of nature, than ·by the in1mediate
elfecl: of all things, that is the experience
which the underftanding difcovers to us 1 for
from thefe, it is evident, th~c they who firfl:
direll:ed their 11:udie&
to philofophy, have
opened a w3y to difcover fecrets replete with
wonder.
And indeed reafon, for its excellence, is•
better than exarnple; as is the immortal foul,
whofe work it is, than that of corporeal fenfe:

yet, in a confequential order, this has the
precedence, and is, as it were, the door and
way to that underftanding, to which there is
not the leaft accds, unlefs tranfmitted through
thofe fenfes. Further., whatever, by th~ light
of reafon, man's c0tnprehenfion, or invention,
may be of the powers of the {tars and their
manner of influencing the inferior elementary
and c01npound bodies., beginning from the
chief principles and caufe, properties, paf-
fions, motions, and other active qualities, if
experience does not make it plain, is juftly
and defervedly condelnned and rejected as
falfe; for reafon always is my guide in every
one of them, From the actions of the moft
eminent 1nenin phy.ficand mathematics, I have
fufficiently enlarged elfewhere; and thence, by
way of theory, I have transferred hither a
few thefes the moft concife. But as there
are fon1ewho refofe to follow reafon and the
moft enlightened authors for their guides, I
was unwilling to make any diftinction be-

directions more agreeable to time and nature,
be fo kind as to publi{h and point out myer-
·rors; by fo doing, you will oblige me greatly,
as. in every thing I defire nothing but plain
_and fimple truth; but. if, .after all, you can-
not find any, confefs ingenuoutly, that my
opinion concerning this heavenly fcience is
_right, and my way of calculating true, the
method univerfal, and hefitate no longer in
confirming it is fo. But in thefe examples,
very great care is to be obferved : Firft,
That the luminaries prefide over things fub-
Jecl:ed, not only by that one motion of the
direction, which above the zodiac is made
agreeable to the fucceffion of rhe figns, accord-
ing to the method ufu1lly followed by all
profe!fors, but by both, viz. the right and
converfe.
(
2. That the fame afpecl: and method of ·
calculating may be found in more of the like,
when alledged as proofs, is rhe greaceft evi-
dence of the truth of the matter; for it might
be argued, that one example would perhaps
only agree~ __

3. That 1nydirections are adapted to the
nature of thiQgs ; as, for example, I do not
take the dignities from the horofcope, but.
fro1n the Sun and mediumcieli, according to
Ptolemy and others.
. ~
4. I have not taken remarkable ef.fc:8:s
from the fixed ftars, as many do, and truly
without foundation, but from the erratics r
though the ftars fixed, fpecify and afford fame
little affiftance to the power of the erratics.
5. In all thefe examples, the proportion I
have found of the .arc of direcl:ion correfponds .
with the years of an age.
6. 1 have not varied the time of the nativi-
ties to tnake the calculations of the direcl:ions
agree ; but if in any example I have made ~
little alteration, it is very fn1all, and fcarce
makes any difference on the arc of direction
of the luminaries, whether direct or converfe,
except only in the mundane parallels. How-
.
ever, fron1 this fmall alteration, it may be in-
ferred, that either on that account the time is
reduced to a true one, or, at leaft, that the di-
B 2 reB:ions
h T O T H E Jl E A D E R:
.. recl:ions of the para-lids inI tqe~world were
not fur difrant, and might, notwithfl:anding,
have been of very good ufe, though there
were no change of rime in the nativity; for
every direction c.iufosan alteration in bodies;
but the full effect plainly appears.i by means
of the powtrfu l direttions which arrive fir.ft,
and the fubfequent aflift more. or lefs, ac-
cording as t~e proxitnity of tfie application
or virtuai influx· is greater or lefs : but no
credit is to be given to the tim~ of thofe na-
tivities, in which authors have adopted the
horofcope ,for the giver of life, •where the
luminaries, &c. ought to have been tak/n;
I .
for we may rcafonably conclude, that wh<:,n
the
faid authors have not found their direcl:ionsof
tliat luminary to w hiuh,t1ndoubtedly belonged
the power of life, to agree with die effects,
they havt: rn::idea confiderable alteration in the
appointed·ti~e of the nativity, in order that
they might bring down the borofcope to any
afpecl: of the planets: I can ~ffirn1 what I
}~avefaid to be true, ·for in my youth I faw
feveral carivities, afi:erwardspublifhed by the

affiftance, &c, yet each direction muft always
, be confu1ted and calculate9, agreeably to the
two kinds of afpecl:s.
9, You may know chat thofe nat1v1t1esarc
{hanger, when another ,luminary becomes
the fign~ficator, by rneans of the duplicate
motion of the prorogation, which does n◊t
happen when the horo1cope of the country is
the giver of life, for it only performs m a
right motion1 and not conyerfe.
. I o. You are to obfervc, what is genfraJly
alledged by profdfors, refpecl:ing the lumi-
nary, inftead of the dignities of the fatelli~es,
viz. that the fatellites of a planet come within
30° of the proximity found on either fide to-
wards the lumin~.ries; but a fatellite is no-
thing but a kir.d of afpecl: of the ftars to. the
luminaries of what kind foever, which, if it
be made by applicatio~1, its power extends
inwardly over the wboJe orb of light of the
afpecl:ingplanet, J and tiie more fo, as the
proximity is greater, but by feparation it is
net fo. iThis dottrine n1iy be feen in feveral

they were fignificators, which is the practice
· of feveral profelfors. Magin us has fulw. de-
fcribed the rays in rhe equator; otheq, be-
fides the rays, which the ingenious Kepler
. thought to be efficacious., add the 1emi-fex-
tile and fefqui-quadrate. Wherefore, if you .
carefully obferve, yon will doubtlefs perceive
I have produced lefs afpeB:s than .other
authors.
I 3. If you are defirous to fee of what im-
portance the fecoll_dary directions are to
difcern the particular times of effects_., and
alfo the progreffions, as I have calculated
the ingrdfes and tranfits, both active and paf-
five, and the equal proceffes, according to
the ufual and general way, how idle and
empty jn effect they are, I will leave to your-
folf to confider, as I would not fpend time
to no purpofe to calculate them.
14.. The revolution, as taught by fome, I
have not feen, though in reality thex may
poffcfsforne virtue, but only according to the
conft~tution of the ftars to the pla.ces of the

were pufued upon, advance1nent; for I am
wholly of opinion, that every man is the
author of his own fortune, next, however, to
the divine decree, according to that of the
prophet, " My lot is in thine hand."
Laftly, if, in the calculations of the direc-
tions, you find any difference of minutes from.
the time of the effects; this, however, I am
certain, will always be very fmall Remem-
ber, firft, that the places of the ftars are not
,.perfectly known to us in the producing ef-
.,
fecl:s; feveral motions of the ftars concur to
prevent a true calculation of the fecondary
directions of the procefs, ingrefs, tranfit, lu-

WHEN this Work was finilhed, the very
illufirious D. ADRIAN NEGUS.t\NTrus,
of Fa□urn, a man very well verfed in Allrology,
;ind indeed according to the true doctrine of Pto-
lemy, but alfo in Phyfici and the fublime fecrets
of Nature., tranfmitted to me a method to calculate
the EB perfectly agreeable to reafon and experi-
ence. I thought proper to fet it down here, word
for word, that every one might fee a fecret jn this
art, invented by fo great a man, truly worthy the
pen of the greatell: All:rologers; for l willingly
co□fefs, that with regard to the EllI have laboured
a long time, and have not been able hitherto to
find any truth in it. ·
" The Ell (fays he) if we may credit Ptolerny,
who aff'erts that it has the fame pofition to the l)
as the 0 to the horizon, (Q\,adripart, Book JU.
Chap. xii.) it.ought to be defcribed and defined
in the lunar para1lels; for neither if it be conll:i-
tutttd in the ecliptic, J.ccording to the intentions
of vulgar Afl:rologers, or in the :D'sorbit, as was
once the opinion of a very eminent profeffor of true
judicial Allrology, it will be fouhd to preferve that
C 2 order
'

order of Jikenefs which the refpeclive converfions
of two luminaries, hoth diurnal and annual, de-
note." This man fubfcribes to the truth of every
thing I lately mentioned in my Philofophy of the
Heavens, wherein I faicl that the EBmoves above
the orbit or way of the J) 's latitude, and therefore
above the zodiac.'
But as I have fuewn that the dillance and rays
for the Cardinal Signs are by no means made above
the zodiac, but above the parallel of every fiar,
be argues, ~m<lindeed very ingenioufl y, yet the
0 in like manner is elongated from the Eafi, viz.
above his parallel ; and in like manner the l) ,
who, as not by her rr.tl prefence pofited the EB,
by any other method nor way different from the
place of EB; for no other difference is feen to con-
fl:itute this p::irt i·n nature, unJefs by fuch ac1af-
:fignation and impreffion of virtue, exhibiting by
the l) in the Eafiern 0. \Yhen this man a<lcls,
" For when the 0 comes to the Cardin:i.l Sign of
the Eafi, the□ it is neceffi1ry the ]) be found in its
horizon _afterwards in an equal fpace of time : the
0 digreffing, he mull: be removed from her ac-
cording to his afcenfion ; wherefore, if we fiudy
the matter with accuracy, we £hall find, that the
0, entirely in the fame m:mner as he departs from
the Eaft, the J) is likewi refeparated from the EB,
yet is both above its par,11

pofite fhrs, will be directed by ~ right motion,
and the EBwill be devolved by a converfe mo-
tion rapi<lly to the bodies and rays of the pro-
miffories: if the 0 be confiituted immoveable, and
the ; p:-ece<ling..is ufual, it may very reafonably
he doubted whether the EBinfritutes the direction's
c.onve1fe motion; however, I omit fpeaking of
this till another time, mean while l will fee what
experience fays. ~rhis is worth obforving, that if
EBdocs not con£ ft in the zo<liac, it is neverthelefs
clirelled co the parallels of the ibrs in the primmn
mobile,together with the }), w}rnfe declination it is
known to follow, and which they v:i.ry conrinu.1lly
and focceffively in an equal motion; therefore,
when the ]) comes to the declination of .my fl:ar~
fhe produces double c:ffoct,according to the p1oper
:fignification of every one portended in the genitures,
hecaufe ilie then falls together with EBon the pa-
r::illelof the fame fiar: an invention truly ingeni--
ous; for as the 0, hy his motion in the zocliJc,
fucceffively changes the p:i.ralld, ancltl!erefore that
relative point of his rifing in the horofcope, an<lthe
1), whilfr lhe by a right <lireclion luflrat€S the

confcqucnce to <lr.twto her <leclin;ition the point

for the parallels, which he explain's in thefe words:
I
" In like manner we £ball find, from :i mean me:i•
furement of the 0 to the }), that whatever ratio
an<l:figuration tht? 0 h:is to the eafiern horizon,
the fame bas the }) to EB; for inclee<lthe lumi-
naries, and all the ft.:irs, form no other diftance
from the horofcope and the houfes, except upon
every one of their parallels, and as has been faid by
tlw horary and afcenfionnry times. Ptolemy fpeaks
exprefsl y of this in the Chapter of Life, whence
V.llla reafonably infers, the :figuration of EBto
the }), taken in the fame manner, will be the fame
as the horofcope to the 0; and, on the contrary,
whatev~r figuration the 0 is to the horofcope, the
fame will be that of the )) to E9. Jn like man-
ner, and with reafon, both will be the fame as the
other, thJt is, as mhn y parts as the 0 was difiant
from the horofcope, fo many was the }) from EB,
viz. always above their parallels, an<l by the af-
cenfory times ia them." To prevent any one fup-
pofing this dochine fictitious an<l void of experi-

not be obfcureJ, I have placed the Par.t of For-

FRANCIS' THE FIRST,

T HIS King, in a ftout engagement with a
large body of the enemy, at the river Po, in
_ltaly, fuffered a very great overthrow, his gene-
ra.I ancl valiant armies being all flain, and he
himfel f wounde<l and taken prifoner hy the fol-
dicrs of the Emperor Ch:irles V. This was in the
year 1525, on the 24th of February, when he was
30 ye:.irs and .five months olJ; at which time the
Sun, who is the fignificator of glory, liberty, and
.
, power, came, by a right direction, to the .mundane
parallel (a) of h, an<l alfo to the parallel clcclina-
tion of t, and, by a converfe motion, was fob-
ftitated as near as poffible to the 11oon's diameter,
or 8 and mundJne parallel of Ti.
To the parallel of the declination of Mars the
calcu Iation is as follows; and there is an argu-
ment in the time of the direction, when the Su11
arrives 6° 111.,when he has the declination 13°34',
and the declination of Mars 14° I 2', for this rea-
fon, either becaufe the true place of Mars is want-
jng ?-few minutes, which ma<le the dec1iriatjon of

the magnitude of their bodies, begin to touch at a

it by the center of their bodies ; or, lafily, that
tl1eyhave already reached the times of the other
diretlions: be it as it will, the Sun was conjoined
as near as could be to the declin~tion of t ; it
might be likewife, that the fecondary directions
and powerful ingrelfes may have made the effetl
appear a little before the exact application of the

the right of hyleg belongs, direcl:ed, when the

HE died the 5th of March, 1622, of a dropfy,
aged 52 years and I I months. The 0 is
doubtlefs the figni:ficator of life in this nativity;
but Argol not finding in his numbers any direclion
of the 0 for 53 years, direcl:s the afcendant to a
~ of ~, which is of the long.efl:afcenfion, and in
the place of the direcl:ion is the beginning of the
orbs of 11.,fo that this direction has not the 1eaft
deadly appearance (i). According to our method
the 0 arrives by a right direction at-(k) a o of~
ii1 the zodiac; the 0 '-soblique afcenfion in the ho...
rofcope is 8° 28', from which fubftracl:ing the ho~
roicope's oblique afcenfion, the 0 's difumce from

nfual with fome, to anfwer this method of proceed-

gorouily exact in the judgment of nativities, ·ard
that a malign in/luence of the horofcope ma_ykill
the primar.y, if it has not th~,fignific~tion e( lifo.
But frdm fuch reafoning, the or<lcr am] rnetho(\_
which, Ptolemy lays down for the election of a,
J'rorogator is quite abfurd, uqlefs Jifebe at the dif-
pofal of a fole primar)' lignificator onlr, and a
very powerful reafon convinces us it is fo.1 ,For
even the firfi: prorogator only, that is, if n10re
powerful with refpecl to the rslr, denotes life, o'r

i;annot be admitted, as it would create a ccnfofi.on

marily regards the princip~l pror.ogator; and fo-
condly, the afcend~nt; fo th,)l i-nthe oppofition to
the enemies, it may,kill; ~ut ic is quite the reverfe,

no other of inferior virtue can pat ari end to 'it.
Again► they fay, the reafon why thofe nativities
are ftronger, wherein feveral concur,. to fignify
life, is becaufe the fignHicators of life beingnume..!
rous, there is.a proportional increafe. of ftrength to
prolong life. But it is otherwife from~feveral fig•,
nificators i the afpec\s of the defl:royers are multi•
plied by the di~rent and numerous direcl:ions;
therefore, that perfon who has feveral fignificaton
of life, will be lower in fiation and ihorter lived,
as, in truth, they direcl: the horofcope to the ene-
mies~ purely that it may kiJl; though the lumina-
ries at that titne h.tppily fignify life, arid :ire
lhong, owing to the afpecl:s of the favourable pla•,
nets with which they continue in their dire8ion;
.one, therefore, only flgnifies life elecl:ed, according,

FERDINAND GONZAGA,
DUKE OF MANTUA.
TTE died in Ocloher, 1626, aged 39 years and
fl 6 months ; but as the l> is in the Center of
the horofcope, fhe is the fignificator of life, which
in the 39th year and I-half, had arrived, bya right
direclion, (1) to a parallel of the declination of the
0 and f.,; and, as a quefiion fometirnes arifes, re,
know at what place the fignificator arrives by a di••
re8io11 in the zodiac, of this then I will now
lhew an example: Jn the fir/l place, J thus find
the arc of direc1ion adequate to the 39 years and a
1-ialf; the 0 in 39d 12h, arrives at n 14°, whofe
right afcenfion is 72° 38
1
; the 0's right afcenlion
is 33" 42, which, fuh/lracled from the former,
leaves the arc of direclion for the given years 38•
56'; the D1s oblique afcenfion to the pole 44°, is
290° 48', to which I add the. arc of direclion
38° 56', and l make the fum 3•9• 44, which
the 0 arrives at in the faid year, l find thi,
in the fame table of oblique afcenfions ::: 16°,

in that latitude; but the declination of this pface

therefote the ) in that place obt.\inc!<l a mean de-

was conjoined to ½, and in the mundane parallel

from which 1'- being alone in his *, could not re-
lieve him. J3y a converfe direction the > appJied1
to procure a mundane parallel with the 0 all(! b ~
wbilft all were carried away by the motion of the
primum mobile. But if~ 26° 45', are pofited in
the mediumueli, this ray, by a true calculation,
exactly agrees, for the ])'s femi-diurnal arc is 4°
44'; femi-diurnal arc of the 0's opppfirion is 5ht/;
which added together, make the fum 9h5o'; th~
~ 's right afcenfion is 271 ° 58'; her primary. di~-
tance from the medium ctrli is 26° 45' of~, whofe

and the right d1flanre between the ])..and· 8 of. the

GREAT DUKE OF TUSCANY.
HE died in February 1621, being 30 years and
9 months old.
Argol fays the pole's elevation is 43°, the 0's
.1fcenfion 64° 34', the afcenfion of T;, o 94° 42',
and {uhfirach the arc of direclion 30° 8'; then the

1
,
and fubfrracts the arc of direclion 30° 42' : but I
confefs 1 am ignorant how it can happen, thJt the
fame arc of <lirecl:ion lhould fall to the fame pro-
miffors of the fecond fignificators, who are 3°
of the equation difh.nce from each other, for the
oblique afcenfion of the 0 in 8 246° 58', from
which fubfiracl: the oblique afcenfion of the horo-
fcope (as given by Argol) there remains the 0's
difiance from the 7th houfe 2° 58'. If the 0
lhould remain upon the cufp of the 7th houfe, the
arc of direction of the 0 and the horizon would •
certain! y be the fome; but as his difi::mce is 3°,
there is no reafon why at the fame time of the di-
rection the 0 and horofcope fhould both arrive
together, the former at the o of Fi, and the latter
at his 8.
L z Again,

Again, the 0 's afcenfion 64° 34', it is uncer-
tain in what manner it was taken for '½
's afcen-
fion; 94° 42' is the defcenfion, for the arc of his 8
is 274° 42',from which take 180°"'there remains
the defcenfion of '½94° 42'. But the oblique af-
cenfion of the ))'s 8 is 246° 5~' given, his defcen-
fion 66° .58'; therefore the calculations of Argol
are to me unintelligible.
In this nativity there fuould afcend nt 15°43';
the 0, fignificator of life, was firfi direcled to the
~ of t, ~ut .as the 6 of '½followtd about the
beginning of 1l,'s orhs, the native was preferved :
then he was f~und in the cSof l,, whofe latitude

The place of the direclio~ was Iikewife in the

fjted the more, a~ the 0 in the nativity was C(?n-

fcend~d below the horifon, and in the equal pro-

For eifecl:s, Argol direcls the horofcope's o to
the 0; whereas, the one is not 3pbreta, nor the
other anareta ; for the 0 is conjoined to ~ , and
in her declination, to which the }):1pplies by a for-
tunate, fue :ilfo makes ap?lic::ition to the a and.
declination of 1l-, being conHitute<l in his orb; fo
that to the 0 lhe tr::mfmits none but fortunate qua-
lities. We therefore, in imitation of Ptolemy,
m:ike the l>hyleg, who after her firlt .dichotome in

years before, arrived at the o of °T7by converfe
motion; but, as n1e in the nativity was very for..
tunate and Il:rong, thefo diredioas waited for an
increafe of the direct dire8.ions.
This example alfo teaches us., that the fenti-
rnents of Ptolemy were concerning a violent death;
when in a peremptory p)acf! both the enemies meet
together, it is to be underftood, that in the (a) na-
tivity the violence is firfl: pre-ordained from the
unhappy pofition of the apbreta; .\t other times,
quite the contrary. Rnt becaufe the dired direcT'
tion chanced to be within the orbs of ~ , the £ck-
~efs was attended with a delirium and lethJrgy, fo
that you may perceive this to have been the na-
tive's death.
It may be a{ked, why did not the o of l} with
the 8 of ~ , and their preceding parallels, ki1J,
as they received an addition of frrength from the
afpecl of the enemies ? Anfwer, Becaule the l) was

there were the rays in the * of 1f.. Both in the

CARDINAL OE SALVIATIS.

HE died April 16, 16~2, aged 65 years, i
months, and 15 days. We commonly
teckon this nativity among the feyen which we have
extracled from Maginus, as examples. To 65
years and three months the native Jived, we have
judged the direction of the ll, who is hyleg, ac ..
cording to a right motion to the fixed lbr Cor
Leonis, and parallel to the declination of ! and
the 0; but, according to converfe motion, to their
□, which _direetion ought doubtlefs to be e!teemed
fuffici~ntly powerful to infer a fatal ficknefs, efpe-
cially in an old man. Now, after having well con-
fidered the matter, we adcl that the ]), by converfe
motion, found the mundane parallel of Ti (l\1a-
ginus takes the □ of '½to the horofcope in the
equator, and Argo!, in the fame place, adds tlie
antifcian); the J>being the fignincator, having dig•
nity of life, the calculation of the ))'s -0'iredion to
the nxt ftar of Regulus, and pa~allel declination of
the 0 and t , is as follows: The l) 's declination
23° 54, afcenfional difference 24° 26', Cerni-diurnal
arc I 14° 26', the third part of which is 38° 9', the

therefore,

As the third part of the femi-diurnal arc g8 o

fo is the ) 's dift. from the medit,m c~li 10 I
to her pole • 4 o
To which the obtique afcenfion of the ])'s-8 is
265° 251
, the oblique afcenfion of tbe 8 of Regulus
in that place is 326° 54; from which fubftracling
the former, leaves the direclion's arc 61° 31',
which, equated, points out 65 years 4 months of
his Jife; the l) in that place was in North latitude
4° 32', and confequently her declination was 18° 3';
t the 0's declination was 17°20', and that of 3' 18°
5d; the l) therefore turned between the declina•
tioa of the 0 and 3'. Again, by reafon of the
magnitude of the 0 and ])'s bodies, and alfo on
account of the parallax the D had already gained,
and the 0 's declination declining from that of t ,
who being combufr, di<l not difcover his effeds;
but the 0, infl:eadof him, according to the opinion
of Carden. The »'s converfe diretlion to the
mundane parallel of ~ is thus (o) : The femi..diur-
nal arc of J, is 100° 58', his right afcenfion 157•
30', his dii1ance from the mediumctzli 63° 28'; the

In his nativity the 0 becomes entirely hyleg,

I add thefe ar.cstogether, and the fum is 9.46: the

I~this nativity, if the aforefaid h:id 18°37', nc•
cording to the explanation of Argot, we freely
'Confefs if the 0 were hyleg, no tlire8ion of his
would -agree with the time of the native's death.
The direction's nrc for 56 years 8 months, is
6r0
15', the 0 's oblique afcenfiou is 279° 41'; to
which, if we add the direc\:ion's arc 61° 15',thefmn
1's340° 56'; :infwering to ~ 27° in the fame table,
obnoxious to none of the enemies.
Wherefore, ~s in this nativity the 0 begins to
be feparatecl from the horof-cope, if, to the time in
\he nativity, a quarter of an hour is adJed., which
is probable, becaufe of the ufoal difference between
the folar and civil horology, the prorog,1tory
dignity of life is taken away from the 0, as he has
now left the horofcope, and is transferred entirely
to the D; which that it is fo, is con.tinned by the
~greements of the l) 's directions \\ ith the time of
cleath.
The native died the 4th of A ugufi I 629, aged

HE died Auguft J, 1629, aged 70 years and
9 months; was create4 a Cardinal on the
5th of June, 1596, at the age of 37 years and
7 months.
In this nativity, explained Qy Argol, i is to be
_placedin :!; 12°, not 21°; and he directs the ho-
rofcope to the □ of l] in the zodiac; But as tµe
rays to the cardinal figns in the zodiac :ire rejected
by us for very plain reafons, and alfo by Ptolemy;
and on the other h~nd, the 0 's arc of direction
correfponds very well with the .Pr~per o in mundo,
whereby the prerogatory virtue of both, viz. thai
of a right direll: motion, and the other by a con-
verfe, is injured, tfpecially by tµe fubfequent pa-
rallels of 'f} j~ mundo, as will appear bycaJcufadng
them.
lt is probable, _that the fignificator of life be...
longs to the 0, and that he may obtain his dig-
nity, the nativity mufi be lengthened fome few
' minutes; wherefore we add to the given hours
18 minutes. At the time of his death the 0 came

CARDINAL LANFRANCHE.
HE died the 30th of November 16u, aged 5i
years, 2 months, 10 <lays. He was fent for
in 1606 from Naples by Paul the Vth, to be fecrc-
tary to his gr.indfon, Car<linat Burghefas. He
y.raselecled Cardinal in No,·ember 24, 1608.
i\rgol, in this nativity, as ufual, direas the
l1orofcope, for the native's death, but the 0 is un-
douhtedl y byleg, who falls on a parallel of the
declination of the D; ~ and b following imme-
diately after; and what is very remarkable, the
0 with that declination, 1G

, found the decli-
nation of Syrus, Aldeharam, Cauda, and very near
it Cor Leonis, four fixed llars of the fidl: magni-
tmle, of a hot and deHruclive nature. I have
found, by obfervation, that that declination is pof•
feffe<lof a great force and virtue; fo that if any
fignificator poffefs that point, the fignin.'cation is
there greatly increafe<l, good whh the benign, and
evil with the malignant. I have ob{erved that~
with that declination gives acutenefs to the mincl,
i a ddire for Juxury and pleafure, t anger, mad-
ne(s, boldnefs, temerity, &c.

w111es,produces on the earth vermin todeflroy the
feed, increafes the buds, &c. fo that there feems
t<>be great power in the declination of tbofe fiars.
But it is .very evident that this direction of the
0 was aloae fufficient; for in the nativity the 0 is ,
by leg; was furrendered hy the enern1es by the two
motions in the zodiac, and applied very hear the □
of~ in mundo,-by a true J:!)nverfe motion,.to the □ of
J.?,~only, of-the friends, gave a11y ~ffiftance to
the mundane*, whe.eby fue conferred great digni-
ties; nevertbelefs; _{he being u_nhappUy fttQated in

din.ition in the weO:ern cardinal fign, whence he
is generally the caufe of difeafes: what~ denoted
:lhewed it only to be corrupt, fickly, and of a 1hort
duration. The 0 directed to the I:.). of 1.f.and 6 of~,
conferred very great honours: on the native and un-
expecl:ed he did not feek for honours, but was fought
for
to be _prQmoted. After the 0 had paffed through
the rays of the favourable planets, and declined to
the parall_el of the enemi~s 7 the native died.
But I am of opinion that the feconc.lary direc-
tions, with the other motions, contributed greatly
to his death, as \Ve iliall obferve.
The following is a calculation of the ~ 's direc-
tion:

the age of 47- years and 6 months.
Argol takes the caule of his <leathfrom the horo-

who is undoubtedly byleg, and in the 64 years ana
half comes by a right clireB.ion to the parallel of

of cI', having by a converfe direction fome years
before fet near the 7th houfe.
The direcl:ion to th~ mundane parallel of ~ is
thu.s calculated.
The0 's horary times are I 1° 29'; difbnt from
the medium ccdi I 1° 20'; the right afcenfion of

the imum cce!i (i. e.) in a mundane o ray to the

ferving, that the fignification of what fiar foever,

But becaufe this happens infenfibly, and fuch
rays fo acquired are generally lafting, we have not
fur a long time laid down a method to calculate
them in the Cannons, but any one may, from the
table of the houfes, the time of acquifitioa, and
duration of thefe rays. As in the example, the
(:) pofited in the weft, with ~ t2° in the imum
c~Ji, are found in .!= 2°; and aa the rays thus ac-
quired a-re of a Jong continuance, they denote a
certain univerfal difpofltion of the things figoified,
.. either goo<l or bad, according to the nature of the
afpecling ftars, as it happened to this Cardinal,
who fome years before his death was always fickly; '
and obfervation is wgnderful in the changes of the
times and weathers; for this principal Ptolemyad-

HE diedNovember the t6t~, 1635, 14 hours,
· P. M. aged 63 years, all but 14 days.
For this dfecl, Argol <lirecls the'0 to the anti f.
dons of li and ~; hut as thefe planets are 2° North
latitude, their declination becomes I 6°, whereby
they cut the ecliptic in 16°of.=-, and A rgol takes the
antifcions of~ in:::, 9° 10'. But we dire& the0to
~, 16°1o',and then we !hall fee whether our method
correfponds i otherwife, for the example, we mull:
comply with the opinion of others; v,·z. that the
antifcions is not to be taken by preferving the latir
tude as we do.
The 0 directed to :: 16° is thus calculated:
The 0 's horary times are I 1° 6', which doubled
makes 22° 12'; the fpaceofthe 11th houfe, lufirnted
by the 0 's motion, the pole of the IIth houfe 19°,
and of the I 2th houfe 34°, the diff-erence between
them is 15°; the ohlique afcenfion of the 11th
houfe is 247° 15'; the 0 's oblique afcenfion is
254° 22', therefore his diftance from the I Ith houfe
is 70i'

which added to tbe pole of 11°, makes the0 's pole

;
the oblique afcenfion thereof is ::: 325° 51', fro~
which fubftracl:ing that of the 0, leaves the direc~
tion's arc 69° 7',
which equated gives 63 years. You
fee therefore, gentle reader, that our method, asin
all other examples, agree perfedly well.
The 0 Jikewife had arrived at the proper o j71
·mundo tw·o years before, for the 0 's femi-diurnal
brc is 66° 36
1
; but when the fignificator does not
change the hemifphere, the femi-diurnal or femi•
nocturnal arc is the direcl:ion of the proper o in
mundo, and by his ray the two prorogatory virtues
are injured; vh;. that in the primum mfJbilt.
Lafily, the 0 arrived to the ])'s mundane parallel,
which is calculated thus: The0 's femi-diurn:il arc
.is 4h 26', difiaot from medium cteli 29° 15
1
; the
) 's ferni-no8arnal arc is 4h53', from which arires
her fecondary difiance imumltzii 30° 1': this added
'to the primary is 38° 31', which makes the direc-
tion's arc 68° 32'.
But becaufe the declination of the 0 and ]) is
nearly the fame, and the femi-diurnal arc of thee
and femi-noclurnal arc of the]) the fame, the 0 a

Hence we ore taught that the teftimonies of the

HE died May the 1ft, 162.p, aged 49 years and

This nativity explained by Argol contains many
errors, for 'll- fhould be p9fited in 27° (not 22°) of
~ in 24° not I 9°; t in l-:f'not ~ ; the places Iike-
w ife of i and ~ do not agree, but thefe things we
hav~ not attended to. Argol thinks, and very
jullly, that the 0 is to be direcle<l for life, for he
is hyleg; but he wifl1esbe had exceeded ihe <Soft ,.
then he would have been injured by the cS

He died Febru;lry 18, 1655, This man was a
profeifor of phyfic and philofopby in the college
at Bononia. He argued very fubtlely, and fup-
ported his arguments with the ftrongeft reafon.
Being fent-for by the great men of Italy for hi$
advice, when they were fick, he always returnee\
loaded with honours and rich prefents. He had a
great knowledge of the mathematics. The libe-
rality particularly towards his friends extended to
profufion; in other things extremely prudent and
fagacious. His houfe wasornamented with the moft
beiutiful and valuable piclures, precious fiones,
gems, &c. Hehad filled bis library with volumes
of the heft authors in philofophy, pbyfic, mathe-
matics,. and a{h:onomy.
To bufinefs his application was ~nremitting;
of his promif~s h~ was a careful obferver. In iliort

fobfifl:ed between us, he defired me (for he was .
well acquainted with the common way) to calcu-
~ate the dire8ions of his n;itivity, which I very

thought tl1efe afpeels would not prove fatal, yet
he died on February 18, 1655, almofl: fuddenly,
having fome clays before received the holy facra-

fick the night before; however it be, he died the
day he predicted, to the grief of the whole city
~f Felfina. His heirs, for the love they bore their
very learned preceptor, celebrated.his funeral with
great pomp and folemnity.
The direel.ions arc for 52 years is 47° 50'; for
the 0 after the nativity arrives in 52 days of cy, is

The calculation of the D'• converfe diretlion
to the mundane parallel of 8 , whilfi both were
carried away by the motion of the primummohih,
the calculatiob is thus:
The ))'s femi-noclurnal arc is 69° I 7', that of

I~ 's right afcenfion is 56° 28', of 8- 344° 28',
which fubfiracled from the former, leaves the D's
right difiance from I 71° 50' : her primary difiance

which fubfrracl:ed from the primary, leaves the di-
recHons:ire 47° 50; and if you havea mind to cal-
culate by logarithms, the minutes of the ndl num-
bers are 9950, where the logarithms is 399,782;

f. YOUNG CH11,o OF D. C"'MILLUS P1Azzo1r,
OF PADUA!
HE W4S born in th~ year an~ day, as placed
in the celefiia] qmftitution, alild bapti:z.e~
immediately, as he was not expect~d to live.
He did not live ;o the end of his third year; for
on the 7th of March, about the 2orh hour, he was
<lrowneclin a fmall quantity ~f water ip a place
where chickens ufed to drink.
Jn this nativity, if the place of the parsfaYtrme
is calculate<l in the common way, it will fall in
27Jt20° 27'; t~ whi~h, altogether, ~nd without
any exception, according to Ptolerny, the 4gni'."'
fication of ljfe ~elong, which indeed does not
feem to fuffer there any viol~nce, Qr deadlydirec"."
~ions, to the third year.
If any one fupofes he finds any, I beg h~ would
<lifcover it.
But according to the ingenious invention of Ne-
gufantius, we look for the place of the parsJortu-:
'
methus:
The 0 's oblique afcenfion taken in the horo-
fcope is 7° 45'; which, fub~racte<lfrC?m
~liehoref-:
cope's
. fcope's oblique afcenfion, leaves the 0 's. difbnce
(coq1 it 242° 52' : I add this to t!Je ])'s right af..
cenfion, a11dI make the right afceofion of parr
firJlfltllf 198° 32', whicl'), as we have fai<l, will
contain the l) 's declination. I fubfiracl: the right
afcenfion of the medium cceli,' from that of pars
fortutt~, and its dilhnce therefrom is 37° 55';
and as its horary times are I 1° 9
1
, it doubtlefs re-
mains ahout the middle Qf the eleventh noufe,
-
where t 's 8, and o cofmical r:1y of ½'s fall.
But let us calculate thefe rays exacl:ly:
.Asthe horary times of pars - I I 9
is to its difiance from the medium ctEli 37 55
fo is ~ 's horary times 12 57
to his 2ndary difl:.from the imum ct?li 44 2
his primary di.ftance is 48° 40'; from which, fub-
~racling the fecondary, leaves the direclion's .1rc
of pars to l 's 8 4° 38'.
Again. The femi-diurnal arc of pars is 66° 54,
and is taken from the horary t;mes multiplied by
6; therefore, if from the femi-diurnal arc is fub-
firacled its diftance from the medium cteli, there
will remain the clifl:ancefrom the horofcope 28°
59.' No\V1 fay,
As the horary times of parsfortune 11 9
Is to its difl:ant lrorofcope 28 59
So is l, 's horary times 18 57
To his fecondary difiance from the
nudium,wli • ..

from which fubltracling the primary 46° 28', ·
leares the <lirec\ion's arc of pars fortune& to the
cofrnical o of l} 2° 48'. But the EB remained
about the b~ginning of 1ft, r., in the eighth boufe,
the }) in :: , and both the }) and EBunder a pa-
rallel of b 's declination, and EBapplied to the
hoflile rays of the enemies, which threatens drown-
ing, as Ptolemy fays in the chapter of death.
What wonder, then, if this unhappy jnfant met
with the above-mentioned fote, and came into 1be
world attended with nothing but ficknefs.
It is ratper wonderful he furvive<l; the reafon
he diJ, was perhaps owing to the cofmical paral-
lel of 1l-concurring to that part; which, if any
cboofes, he may c.ilculate, and will find I am
right.
But 1J.being unfortunate, nay, very much fo,
am, alo11eag:iinft two enemies, could be of no
fervice; ilnd what is worth obferviog, that at tbe
~oth hour 9f the 7th pf March, in which the In-
fant was drowned, o' went over the middle of the
fifth houfe, that is, the ~ of the mµn<laneplace of
the EB, :mu T-; in the middle of the focond, in the
o of the farpe; fo th~t we know there was no
other place of the EB, except_t~~t which we have
calculated : and this methocl concerning it, is cer-
t~inl y conformable to reafon, ~nd alfo experi-
ence.
