John Leslie Randall was born in Warwick on 27 November 1933 where he attended a local school. He wrote a memoir about his experiences there which he published privately.1 &nbsp;He took a degree in chemistry at the University College of Leicester and a postgraduate certificate in education. He taught biology at Leamington College and King Henry VIII’s School, Coventry and also taught parapsychology for the Coventry Education Department.

Following retirement in 1990 he was active in voluntary social work among prisoners and the homeless.2  Psychical Research

Randall joined the Society for Psychical Research in 1953 and served on its governing council until 2010. He worked with JB Rhine as a visiting research fellow at the Institute for Parapsychology in North Carolina, carrying out ESP and PK tests, with schoolboys and small animals as subjects’.3 He obtained mixed results, but later stated his view that the reality of psi phenomena had been proved ‘beyond all reasonable doubt’.4 &nbsp;

In retirement he wrote articles about psychical research and spiritualism for the SPR’s publications. &nbsp;

In Parapsychology and the Nature of Life (1975), Randall argued that phenomena such as ESP, telepathy and psychokinesis do not appear to be explicable in terms of the mechanistic-reductionist theory and that parapsychological findings ‘seem to show clearly the existence of properties of living things which transcend the laws of physics’.5  Interest in Survival

An experience in 2007 stimulated his interest in survival – the death of a close friend whose daughter said she saw ‘a silvery shimmer’ leave her mother, travel to John and descend onto him’.6 In his writings he questioned the comparative lack of interest in near-death experiences shown by parapsychologists, but expressed optimism that science would ‘throw some light on the world beyond death’. 7  Works  Books
