  		              		Experience Description   

    While white water rafting, the raft rolled over and got caught up in rapids. I wasn't  wearing a life vest.  At first I was panicked, aware that I was going to die because I couldn't possibly get out of the situation.  

  Once I accepted that I was going to die, time stopped.  I was in complete darkness and surrounded by love. For the first time in my life, I was at complete peace and without any anxiety.  I understood that everything was one.   Then I had  a life review. At the end of the life review, I heard a  voice say,  'Choose.'  In that instant, I understood that I could stay in complete peace or I could choose to return.  My first thought was, 'This place is really nice, I' m not sure I want to go back.' But then I knew that this current time is a very important time to be on Earth and that I would come back.  The difference was that  I would be reborn and need to relearn how to walk, talk, and think. That would be  hard.  Understanding this, I chose to return to my body.  

  Suddenly, I was back under water, in pain, and thinking, 'How am I going to get out of this?'  The voice returned and told me, 'Stop fighting the water. You have very little oxygen left in your muscles. Relax, go with the water, and in a minute you will be able to get out.'  So, I did what the voice told me to do and that is what happened.  I don't know how much time passed but suddenly, my foot hit something and the voice said 'NOW!'  I pushed against it as hard as I could and I hit the air.  I took a breath in so violently that I wanted to throw up.  People were scrambling up and down the banks, screaming, 'There she is!' A man in a kayak paddled to me and took me to the shore. 

   I didn't speak about what happened for years because I didn't know how to put the experience into words.  I was afraid people would think I was crazy.  The experience taught me the only thing that matters is love. We can best show love to others by helping and through acts of service.  I do not fear death and at times have had dark nights of the soul. The illusion of being seperate from our creator is painful and difficult.
