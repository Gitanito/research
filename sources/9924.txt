About half an hour later, I was walking around dazed then entered a seizure type fit. I saw myself on the Emergency Room table but couldn't feel or hear anything. Then everything turned into a great void of light with a sense that I cannot explain. Have never yet felt that feeling. When I finally woke up over four hours had past and I was being told that during that time I didn't know where I was, who I was or what the date was. Shortly after I discovered bumps or scars on the palms of my hands, which look like round half pea size dots, one is outwards and the other inwards. If I scrape them off they come back the next day.

Yes  AccidentSuicide attempt    Life threatening event, but not clinical death   Head on collision with a guard-rail at roughly forty-five mph, ripped approximately one hundred and fifty feet of guard-rail, sound heard about quarter of a mile away, car flipped end to end forcing engine into front seating area.

How do you consider the content of your experience?      Mixed

The experience included:      Out of body experience

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?       I don't know exactly how to answer this question, during out of body experience when I was younger I felt much different than near death experience.

The experience included:       Light

Did you see an unearthly light?       Yes   Almost blinding but soothing.

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will   I was told it was not my time.

What is your religion now?       Liberal   Buddhist/wiccan

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       Yes.  I do not fear death.  

     After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      Yes   The sense of feeling, something that nothing comes close to in life.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       Yes     I can 'read' people, example: know whether their intentions are good. 'Good' meaning not using for benefit of themselves.

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        Knowing what happens when you die.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     No

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No
