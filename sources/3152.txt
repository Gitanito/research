N. Meade Layne
AT LEFT is a copy of a portrait pho~o .of the
late founder and fonner director of:: BSRA, N.
Meade Layne. He began his public borderland
work with the publica·tion of the "Round Robin",
a mimeographed journal, in 1945. His sincere
and liberal-minded effort to review and report
on the Borderland Sciences: Psychic Research,
Radionics, Radiesthesia, Fortean falls, Occul-
tism, Flying Saucers, Dowsing, etc., slowly
ga~ned a following and in 1946 he decided upon '
the title, Borderland Sciences Research Asso-
ciates. It was in this year also that the
unusual trance mediumship of Mark Probert was
brought to his attention, and through Mark the
contact with the members of the Inner Circle,
including the Yada di Shi'ite. Mr. Layne con-
tinued as director of BSRA until June 1, 1959.
He pas~ed away at a rest home in San Diego at
the age of 78, May 12, 1961.
AT RIGHT is the present (1973) direc-
tor of BSRF, Riley Hansard Crabb. For
reasons of ill health, Mr. Layne asked
Mr. Crabb to take over directorship in
May 1959. Mr. Crabb's background quali-
fications for such work included 25 years
of metaphysical study in the Theosophi-
cal and Rosicrucian schools, editor and
publisher of magazines and industrial
journals, industrial work with ~in~ea­
polis-Honeywell and the Naval M~ss1le
Center, Pt. Mugu, California, and per-
sonnel work and counseling in the U.S.
Civil Service. His primary responsibil-
ity to borderland researchers is to give
them recognition, attention and encour-
agement, through the Round Robin Journal
of Borderland Research and through per-
sonal contact.

No atteMpt is Made in the follo,-r.i.rig peg~s to preY~ the objective
and factual existence of the -Flying Discs and other st~ange sky craft,
since on this point there is no longer any doubt. On account of the
great variety in .shape 1 colo~ and behavio~ of thes~ flying objec~s, a
generi~ naJYte is nee~. ed. The tc~J!'I. Ether Ships or Ether Craft has be~n
adopted, since it indicates the true nature and origin of all these
diversified phec~mana. ·
Borderland Sciences Research Associates do not con~titute or rep-
resent any cult,. organization or special inter.est. They are free-lance
inves·i.:i gator~ of phenoMena wi t:h "''hich <ffi ~ial science, fur one reason
~r another, does not deal. The ~nt e rial cont ~iBcd in this booklet is
believed ~o ~e of great inportance and is presented as a public service,
and the Associates welcome the cooperation of persons sy-mpathetic with
their attitude and o b jectives~
THE DECEHBER 195 7 INFOR?~ATION BULLETIN
This is a memorandum concerning our Mimeu booklet entitled "The
Ether ship l-1ystery and Its Solution", 'd th subtitle "r'lying Discs".
This was first issued some 5 - 6 years ago and has had two reprints.
At present no ?opies are available.
We greatly regret that the authors of several recent books, 1~ile
referring to the Eth~r Ship J~stery in favorable terms, have been under
the iAprcssion that "re have is sued T\'10 books instead of . the ONE mention-
ed. This arises in part froM the fact that the aSRA has also issued
various synop~es and digests dealing with the Etheric Interpretation
of the aeroforms (Saucers), many of which have been distributed free or
offered to Associates at ' cost price.
Further, we have a 90-page mimeo book called THE COlUNG OF THE
GUARDIANS, which cons~st~ Maiuly of verbatim statements ~ade _ by Inner
Circle of lfarJc Probert (deep tran~e mediumship) conccrni~g the aerofor"'s
and the incursion of the space people. This book is priced at $3.00
and is of special interest to investiga-tor~ \·rho are not deterred by
the use of paranormal sources. The Et~eric !nterpretation of the Discs
and other related phenoMena was given. us by these same Controls, in 1946.
, has never been retracted or seriously Modified -- and has proven ade-
quate to cover the many COirtplex phases of the £.-~aerie visitation.
This leads us to su~ · up briefly our reasons for NOT having offered
a fourth reprint of the first booklet l'lentioned above -- THE ETHERSHIP ·.
MYSTERY ·AND ITS SOLUTION -- FLYING DISCS. The ae.l'i~d phenoJ'Ilena discus-
sed in it canNOT by understood without having recourse "to the concept _
of the E~her(s) ·-• and this involves an understanding of various conc~pts
of ~!i ty -:-.·a t :echnical word used in four or five senses al'tong phy~
sicis.ts. The ETHER SHIP MYSTERY booklet refers ·to the e~her only in a
si~ple. and elementary sense, and is open to valid objections on that
score.
Also there are, in that booklet, ~any sentences which should be
rephrase.d to al·low for comJI'Ients and inforrnat:ilon received from the Inner
Circle during the last eight years. Further, there is so much b1tter•
ness and ~ontroversy going on, and such deterl'lined ignorance of elemen-
tary metaphysics blocking all highways, that the inducel'tents B2! to
rep~icnt anything at all nearly outweigh the contrary.
If in spite of these, and of added det erren~s of health, time, and
inadequate means we should issue a near-verbatim reprint of THE ETHER-
SHIP MYSTERY, a Month to six weeks will certainly be required. Meanwhil~
however, we can make no commitments, except that we shall try to notify
all Associates and inquirers somewhat in advance -- and trus~ that they
will bear in mind the various caveats of this page. ·
Meade Layne, Director
San Diego, December 1957

We suspect that this early work of Mr. Layne , John Hilliard, Ed
Schultz and the Inner Circle Controls m~y coneti tute a primer of space
.travel. At this writing in june, 1962 our space scientists are frank
to ad~it the enormity of space .travel problel'ls. Guarded co~ents indi~
cate that some suspect that physical travel to the moon is only for the
select few, and inter-planetary travel utterly impossible. Time will
tell. Heanwhile we shall push our basic· premise, that the Etheric or
4-D interpretation of Flying Saucers is the only explanation that makes
good science and good sense.
All toldJ Mr. Layne produced four booklet s on the Flying Saucer pro-
blem: "The Hys·tery of the Flying Discs" 1948 (out of print), "THE ESM
and Its Solution" 1950, "The Ether of Space" 1953, and "The Cotni:ng of
the Guardians" 1953. Only a few of these last two are on hand here at
Hdq. Financial conditions permitting, it is our plan in the next year
or so to combine all four of these into a printed, hard cover book -~
a memorial edition of Ur. Layne's work.

!tlE ETHER-SHIP_~~~
AND ITS SOLU!IO~
The series of aerial phenomena ~hicb are here described under the
terM "ether-ships" (Flying Sauc'!rs) first attr.3.cted public attention in
the· fall of 1946. It was by no t'leans the first appearance of these
craft in the skiea of our planet, but very few persons were .a•fare of
this fact, and the public as a ,.,hole at first refused to cre.dit the
reports at all~ The news;pap.e.ns, the radio~ and many psychologists and
scientific workers joined in discrediting the alleged facts, and in at-
tributing them _to delusion or delib~rate fal~ifying. Nevertheless the
evidence continued to· accut'lulate, with MOSt circumstantial and. detailed
reports froM competent observers, until finally a systematic investiga-
tion was undertaken by the United States Air Fore~.
The outcome of this was indeed curious, s:i.nce after Sol"'\e two years
of study of the ph ~n. omena, the Air Force hac recently ann·ounced offici-
ally that thera is no genuine and factual basis for tlie reports. Th~
explanation for this w.ill ~oubtless become cl~ar at sone ; future time.
The public, however, shows no sign of accepting this reMarkable pro-
QounceMent. New r~ports of the strange s~y vi~itors appear almost
daily, and their existenca is definitely est~blishcd.
The purpose of these pages, therefore, is not to argue the case for
the existence of the Discs or Saucers (since data 'h''OUld :-un- to SOMe
hundreds of pages), but rather to present ac ~inply as po~sible the true
nature and meaning of the phenomena. It cceBc to us important, and in
the nature of a public duty, that thiD be don~. There is already ap-
pr~hension in the Minds of ~any 1 and if (as ~e expect) ~any ~ore strik-
ing events should occur, there is soMe danger of panic. If these visit-
ing craft are attributed to so~e foreign and unfriendly governMent, hos-
tility and fear r.t.ight develop; and if they are believed to corte from
some other plan9t of our solar systeM, unreasoning and ~uperstitious
fear is to be reckoned with, ~erhaps with a considerabl.a degree of ·. social
disintegration. This latter hypothesis, in fact, is already being ad-
vanced in all seriousness though for no better · r eason than that no ·other
2r!&ia ~£m~-£~!Y~h1~· Yet there is another possible source (and we-
are convinced the true source) for these strange craft, and the time has
come when this explanation l"!USt be made available to everyone, in the
siMplest t erms po~sible.
Unfortunately, not. everyone ,.,ill find the explanation easily under-
standable. It cannot be disposed of by a word of one or two syllables
only, such as Hars , Venus, or even n u ~s ia, but requires a little sus-
tained attention and mental effort. On the other hand, the interest of
most of our readers Will not be in the physics and speculative science
involved1 but in a fe'o~ eMinently practical questions, such as:
1. What are th~ Flying Disc~?
2. Where do they come from?
- 1 -
3. Who oper~tes them?
4. lihy do they coMe into our skies?
s~ Are they friendlyj or are they dangerous?
An ansWer to these queationsJ if it can be given, will probably
~atiaty the active curiosity of moat readers. To those of a more reflec-
tiv_
e rdnd; .and· to· the scientist, philosopher, and non-do~atic _
religion-
ist, such. answers, baldly put, will b~ only a shado,wy beginning or p_e~­
baps too fantaatic to reck~n with at all, But for our present purpose
ve· aha·ll · neglect these tough-rtinded. and critical tolk, and answer our
ow question·s ··in a most categorical way.
WHA~ ARE TaE ·FLYING DISCS?
i'ir.a:t let us say wh·at they ·are not, They are ~ delusions, fan-
tasy, or lies. -They are n.ot constructed by any foreign government, or
by our own, They do not come from the depths of the se~ -- though. same
ot . theJ'Il may enter the sea .at times. They do not coMe from the Polar
z:egions, or from Tibet or Java -- though it is conceivab'le that some·
temporary base on our earth may be ~tilized. They_ are not- constructed
in. th·e ear.th·t a interior -- though they may have some. connection with
underground· races or be inter~s~ed in thel'l. They are not conatruotio·na
ot .the Atl:an.teans or other ancient peoples, preserved in caverns ag1l'inst
the c.oming day of need, \'le Jl\entions these hypotheses because they · have
all been seriously advanc~d. Our categorical denial should really be
·read tli.i s way:
'~v~ have no evidence that any ·of these explanations is correct, and
none of them coincide with . what we believe to be the correct facts• But
ve offer the first word and not the last in this matter . New data may
appear- a't any tirne. 11
l'o _
th.ese· denials let us add, the etheric craftj th·e Discs, do not
.corrre from any other planet (visible a.stronol"\ical body only) of our solar
~ystem. or· from any: ~ther heavenly body known to us. So far as a ·popu-
.lar explan·ation exi_
sts, thi·s planetary one is most in f ·avor, The reason
3-.s obvious and· the reasoning goes this way: The Discs are not made on
this - ~th -~yet they are real and not illu~ionary -- -therefore they
mus-
t ·be -made~ on some o~her 'planet, pres~mably Hars or Venus, since these
.
-are· th~ - n.ea:rest• Thi.s reasoning, however, suffers froM what logicians
ca.l.l an .".omitted -,middle11 , or ·a third somewhat, an alternative which is
oTerl'ook~d. "Can you build a better 1"\ousetrap?n asks a magazine writer
recently; clearly distrusting his own planetary theory yet unable to
tb.i.n..k ' of anything else. \ie reply promptly,. we certainly can. The simp-
lest deacr_j.ption of this "mousetrap" is our present objectiveJ and if your
pa.tience -permit-s we .shall try to 1"\ake· the whole ·concept reasonably clear
~-though ·not· necessarily acceptable to _
your ·personal thinking, .of cours~
Wha-
t .are the Discs and where do they:. COllie from? \•1e ahail- -have 'to
combine tbe .questions and answers. They col"\e fro"' . the region of existenc~.
ealled the Etheric Plane, or Ethcri~ level --and ·by us with · the na~e
&theria.
Who. operat.es them? The Etheric People, the Etherians.
- 2 -
Are they friendly, or hostile, or dangerous? Neither friendly nor
hostile on the w~Jole, but Mainly indifferent toward us. But they are
not indifferent if we attack them, or pursue and annoy theM, or make
them uncomfortable (apparently) by our atobombs, the release of atomic
or nucle~r energies.
~urther on this point: It is likely, not provable, that our Air
~orce has already lost more than one ship through their atteMpted inter-
ference ,dth these etheric craft. It is beli~ved and is probabl~ that
they ~re surrounded by a powerful MaJnetic field, or soMe force corres-
ponding to it, which easily disintegrates our o'm aircraft. It is like-
ly that the release of atoMic energies is felt on the e~heric levels
with some discomfit"..\re •. It is possible, though wholly conjectural,
that they Might intervene to prevent a .,.,orld war '"ith atomic \veapons~
and especially ,.n.th such a 'veapon as the proposed hydrogen bomb.
But then, why do they come into our sides at all? T-..ro reasons
can be suggested, or two aspects of the saMe reasou. These etheric
craft have appeared at intervals throughout history, sometimes without
definite correlation w-ith earth events, but al,.,ays (i~ is said). when
a civilization or cul~ure had reached its peak and was entering upon a
period of decline and fall. T~eir purpose was simply to obse~ve and
study the conditions and state of hutTianity, for their own informatlilun
and their historical archi~es~ They have also appeared prior to ter-
restrial c onvuls-ions, such us •olcanic eruptions and ea:-th quakes. In
the present instance~ it is likely that both re~sons exist. The social
and polit ical state of the ,.,orld ·is indeed parlous. 0\!r weapons have
become a Jl'tenace t:o the Etherians tht::Mselvec , ~nd it is said that seis-
Dic disturbances are impending. Over the Pacific slop~, for exampla,
the flight of Ether ships has followed the magnetic ~~ridians, ncrth-
and-sc:Jth. It is said that the Etherians are doi!lg this in order to
observe the for~ation of the etheric vortexe~ w~ich presage an earth-
quake; they are charting this area, and also the "''ho:l;.e of the earth's
·· suz·face~ for the same general purpose of scientific study.
Now, whatever you think of the ideas and explanations here advan-
ced, remember that there is nothing vague and uncertain about the pre-
sence of these strange craft~ or about their remarkable speed and power
and comp1ete superiority in the air. This is e.n !u:t~!!.~ el:L..t?!£:Cti£al
matter -- and how far-reaching it May be, no one can ~ay. This means
th~t~ur per s onal attitude is also a matter o1 practical ~onccrn. Let
us rernen:ber that the Etherians are not ill-di 3posed to,.,ard us, that
we should NOT fear theM, should ~!: attack them. Further phenornerta
are al~ost c t::rtain to occur -- and may be of the most re~ar~able kind.
Panic and superstitious fear may seize upon the Jl'tasses. It Jl'tay happen
that a conoiderable Measure of responsibility will fall upon those of
us who have some ~easure of understanding of what ~s taking piace~
Heretofore the Etherians have wi. thdraun quietly 1-1hen ·their mission ,~a s
co~pleted; men thought of thell't as Gods or Angels, or spirits of the
air or demons, ernbqdied them in f~lklore and mythology, and forgot them
little by little. _
So it may be, this time. They may \dthdr.
aw from our
ski(;s, and in a few months men 'dll have almost forgotten them. But
there are reasons which cannot be elaborated hc~e, for believeing events
J"'\ay take another anc more 3trildnf. cn:.:~sc. Neit!1e:a.· your ldll no.r Mine
- 3 -
~an stay these events, but fear, fanaticism and panic May work incalcul- .
able woe. Panic is contagious, it engulfs one like an enormous· wave,
and at the "oment we fancy ourselves cool, calm and superior of mind, we
are dragged under by it. No other considerations would lead us to write
these pages, which ''Till for the most part be read with derision or be
wholly ·disregarded.
WHERE IS ETHERIA?
One other Matter of immediate practical interest, the inevitable
quest1.on :- lih~ is Etheria? (If you think ~her~ is an easy question, go
put it to the philosopbersl) B~t some answer MUSt be made, so here ~s
a reply in e few lines, to be elaborated perhaps on subsequent pages •
...
Etheria ·is here -- if we kno'~ what here means% Along-side, inside,
outside our world:--Because our world, that is, the so-called dense mat-
ter of the objects in our world, is a raref~££1~. It is spaced out like
a vast net -- a net '~ith enormous l"\eshes. Imagine, if you will, a n.et
of wire with meshes a mile wide. Hould not wind and water, flow through
that net as if it did not exist? A little friction, very, very little!
On the strands of those meshes we live. That is the Go-called dense
matter of our "'orld. ''le look out across the J'T\esh and do not see anything
in it, or hear or feel anything in it, and so ca.
ll it emp!L..u~ace.t 1tean-
ingless words in the abysses of folly! We see, hear , feel the other
strands of the mesh1 and call our world solid, firm and material! Call
it a real and substantial thing2 But the "spaces" of the JTlesh are a
thousand and ten thousand times greater than the sub s tance of the strands. ·
'Yhat is in these spaces of the mesh of our "mattern? Space? Space is
not riothing. Space is stuff, is matter. Wh~t kind of Matter? The
matter which Makes up the ethers. Hore dense -- not less, but More
dense by far than the rarefactions of our world. The. matter of-the
Etheric world! Inside the molecules, inside the atoms, other atoMS
still other atoms inside. of those, or ten thou~nnd Chinese eggs each in-
side of another. If you think this is imagination, or that there is no
·· room for these interpenetrating universes -- ask the physicist an~ the
mathematician. They will tell you there is nothing in the omniverse but
room; a.nd room, again, is 'space, is stuff, is basic world-stuff,· mind:-
stuff, life-stuff; and there is no emptiness anywhere, - - And that is
lotily Etheria is here! But it is also every'"here. All heavenly bodies
have an etheric realm.
A few lines more and we shall have done with the more practical
and pressing aspects of our subject. The etheric "ships", as everyone
knows, are of many types, not a ll of thern Discs by any Means. Some are
long and cigar shaped; many are shaped like balloons or dirigibles; some
have wings or wing-like attachments. Many of them appear to change shape
whil·e in the air . Their color v a ries also and has also been seen to
change. Some of thetrt resemble fire-balls; others are accoJTipanied or fol-
lowed by smoke, vapor , and luminous appearances. Some are translucent, ·
or seetrt to glo'' froM within. They travel at all speeds, fro!'l1 zero (sta-
tionary) to thousands of miles an hour. They also vary widely in size,
frdm a few feet or yards in diamater to nearly incredible diJT~ensions;
we have r e ports considered trust,.,orthy of at least one craft ten miles
in length.. They h ~ ve a curious way of disapp~aring suddenly when in
- 4 -
..
- plain sight, and also of rapidly d,.!indling in size without ".'i.thdrawing
· in distance. It is well to bear all these itci"\S in mind, since any
single explanation nust obviously cover all of tbe!'l; it is not enough
to invent so"'e theory for the disc-shapes alone and then irrta.gine what
that the whole J'l.atter is accounted for. No'"" under the "etheric explan-
ation" which we are presenting here, our under~tanding is briefly uhis:
Ej.'HERIC EXPLANATION OF t'LYISG SAUCERS
All of the types of craft just rrtentioned co~e frorrt the sa~e source.
All a~e constructed by Etherians. Their variety arises fro~ the fact
that ~any of therrt are experimental, and thet different types of the~
serve different technical purposes. These craft are built in matter of
the etheric plane and are iiTiperceptible to us, since they exist in what
we call "empty space". They enter our plane or our level of perception
by a process of materiali1.ation. The extremely dense matter which fills
in the pattern of etheric stresses is replaced by 1"\atter of the kind that·
is visible to us -- or better, its vibration rate is lowered until it
bedol"!es visible. A little like· slewing dolm a very fast fan until one
can see it~ blades. This is closely ~imilar to what happens in the
pheno!Tienon of apportation (,,1here o bj ect.s, of a1~y kind or size, are
"Miraculously" transported into and out of sealed rooms, sealed con-
tainers and the like.). Hany p~op le, and most sci~ntists, take no stock
in this alleged phenomenon, but it is well attested and cannot be sur-
render ed on that account . Nei~her th~ pattern nor the molecular filling
is destroyed; the object ~ecoMes inYisibl·e because the ntomic motion is
speeded up, and it can- pass through other l"'<ltter (a wall,e.g.) because
of this same fact. Tl:i::; i~ equiYal ent to nn increase in density when
an object on cur plane is being apported from cne place to anQther. To
an Etherian, an object m<l:~riali~inc ou our ?l~ne wculd de~aterialize
on his; to us it Materialize~ in our field of perception, and deMaterial-
izes when it returns to its etheric ~ta~e.
If we understand this, ,.,e are on the w
ay toward accounting for Many
odd items of behavior, such as have been Mentioned above.
It is pr.obably '~ell lmo".'ll by th;;.s time, that several of these
ether 3hips have fallen, and their contents care(ully studied -- although
\dth utmost secrecy. He cann.:>t enter here upon this part of, which hc.s
been printed in other 3SRA publications; we '~ish to refer only to the
"little people", d'"arfs about 30 inches in height, whose- bodies were
found within the Discs. We have reason to believe that the Ethe·rians,
who JT1U st cperate on tb eir bodies just as they do on the etheric substance
of the disc in order to accoJnpany them choose to mat~rialize in small
forrrts, simply for convenience of operation and fli ght . This, like every-
thing else set forth here, is according to our be~t knowledge and belief
at this writing. \'le r epeat, that "'e are offering the first words and
not the l a st on this extraordiQary problem.
The propulsion cf the etherean -;raft is beyond th_
e present concepts
of our science -- yet '~e have a good clue to its nt'-t\Jre, and shall coM-
ment on it on a latP,r page. (Th~re is no motor, propeller or other
meahanism inside the fal~en discs., sc far as ,_,e ~ 1 <"-V~ been able to learn.)
- 5 -
' .-
. . .
We ·must add the extraordinary fact, that under certain conditions, •.
or at certain· stages' of Jl'lateria:J.ization, or at certain altitudes and
pressures, the substance of the ~her ships -is 1elly-l!ks and -actually
does ··change _
in shape and apparent size. (The outer skin of the fallen
discs, however, ·is . harder than steel, and of an unidentified substanc·e.)
. . .
It is our information that certain types of the ~ther ships ar~
and have long been used for inter-planetary travel. Those who persist
in-·the belief· :that they come from vfsible planets of onr -
system, v.i.ll
~ventually seize upon this as a confi~matory fact. ·· Bui the ether sh~pa
do NOT.originate on visible planets, as we have said. Interplanetary
travel is siMply .one of their innu~erable uses, and this fact should

around a~l visllli...2.!!jects. It is also the home and JI\Otherland of our
plane, all the objects we see about us derive fro~ that souree, and our
own bodies also. We ourselves are Etherians by ancestry and descent;
f.or Etheria is the home of the human race. That we should be so grossly
ignorant of it is strange indeed.

It has been the practise of the present writer, when attempting to
lecture on this subject, to allow a brief intermission at this point
before entering on e~en more fantastic excursions. At this time the
more outraged· hearers ~ere free to withdraw, noisy sleepers could be
admonished, and if the entire audience -- often as many as ~enty people
chose to depart en masse, a refund of one-third the admission money was
usually sufficient to insure a peaceful exit. The advantages of this
plan were so glr"ea.t that it has her~ ·been impQrted into "-'ritten composi-
tion also, th~ intermission taking place at th~ begin~ing of Section II.

II
Having now disposed of the more urgent issues of this subject and
following the intermission, it seeMs best to refer again to the subject
of this Cloud-Cuckoo-Land of Etberia, and the possibility, probability,
~ven the necessity for itl!l existence. \ve refer to it under - this ~ythi­
cal title because ~ost people, though they believe in heaven on Sundays
and in hell when J!ti:sfortune pur sues them, are quite uhable to_ believe
that Etheria' being invisible, unhearq and unto~chable, has any reality
about it at all. We do not blame theM particularly, at least not as
MUCh as we do soMe of our speculative physicists "'ho are already up to
their necks in Oriental n~taphysics, a·nd hence sh~ be reasonailly open
minded. Yet it may be possible to invest the idea with a certain sweet
reasonableness fDr a time, even though our indomitable common (non)
sense rejects it soon afterward.
If there are colors we cannot see, sound we cannot hear, and dense
and solid bodies which we c·annot discover by touch, it is certainly not
too difficult to. c onceive of a world which though possessing sounds,
colors and material objects, is yet !~perceptible to us. It would be
as unknown to us, by direct perception, as a ~an is to an ant,or a bird
to a beetle. And if ant or beetle, or a fish in its element could be
questioned and could Make reply, they would probably be deeply sceptical
· about the existence of men and birds --unseen and unseeable entities
alleged to be living right along-side of the~ in the s ame world. This
is, obviuusly, a matter of what is called planes of consciousness or
awareness, and not really in the Hsame" world at all. The ant world. is
the nest or hill; the fish '\torld is a li"'i ted a rea of sea; and though
it happens that Man can peer in on both of them, they have no way of
discovering hil'l'l. At this point the frui·tful principles of analogy sug-
gest, that poss~bly there are invisible beings who can peer in on man
also. He may be the "crux'' of creation (or cross of affliction of it)
but is not necessarily its crown. And though r eputed· to be a little
lower than the angels, this earth manifestation of him at least May be
but little higher than a caterpil·lar, in the eyes of unknown but observ-
ing Intelligenc~s. This somewhat despit e ful guess , however, is a little
by the way; we intended to return to our high school physics ("}take Me
a child again just for tonight.") with referenc e to our perception of
sound and color.
Of co~rse, if you define sound a s sensa tion, as audibility, then by
definition there are no sounds you cannot hear. If you define color as
seeing, as v~sual perception, then by definition there are no coiors
you cannot see. aut the physicist knows tha t colors are distinguished
from each other by their wa\!e leng ths, and the length of the waves has
been ~easured. Red, for example, has a wave l ength of .00007594; while
, ~iolet, at the other end of the visible ~pectrum, ~s .00003968. All the
/ other colors come in between with decreasing values. But that does not
mean the series or scale of color is exhausted; the tabulation of wave
lengths goes right along below the red and above the violet. It is only
our ability to ll~ them which runs out on us. Using the word c.olor in
'hie very correct and logical sense, it is plain that an object ~ay have

a color which we cannot see, and will
therefore be invisible to us. ~ ·
The situation with regard to s
sound is of course analogous. Some
people hear sounds which others can-
not; many savages and nearly all ani-
Mals have an almost miraculous acuity
of hearing, and the existence of in-
audible sound vibrations is a ·common-
Place-or science. A whole new science
of ultra-sonics is now fast develop-
ing. The point i~ too obvious to
spend time upon. There are sounds
all about us which we cant hear; just
as there are cplurs we cant see.
There MaY be, then, according to
common sense and common science, a
world of sound and of color. and even
of ·colored objects all about us, yet
wholly unperceived by us • .
All this) as we promised you, is
sweetly reasonable. But. now we co~e
to the st~cker. Everyone knows, you
say, that there are waves, frequen-
cies, vibrations of sound and light
which we cannot sense -- but what
about this matter of touch, of tan-
gibility? ''/e do not see or hear the

THE ELECTROJ(AGNETIC SPECTRUM ~ d&rk: but we soon discover them in

From Williamsf "The .r'undamentals objects are at least tangibl·e and if

o a~1o· there is a world-full of them· all

a world, you say, it PIUSt be vaporous like air or. gas,: or eManations,
~adiations or rays.
The objection is natural, legitimate and anewerable; but to begin,
we must make the difficulty seem worse by · affir~ing that this unsceable
and unbearable world is composed of matter which, far from being like a
vapor or gas, is a thousand times ~ den::~e, !!!.2!:.~ solid, real and mat·-

.few lines baok, about the spectrum of color and sound. We must. now con-
sider ~hat by analogy at least there should be a ''spectrum of touch" or
of tangibility, also.
There really is such a spectrum, and the upper limit of it is fami-
- 8 -
• lia.r to everyone. Wb.en so-lid Matter is vaporized we cannot touch it or
usually see it; nor ca.n "'e feel the presence of MOSt rays, radiations
and e~anations. The difficulty, then, is about the lower end of this
spectrum. We are accustomed to thinking of very dense matter, such a~
a stone or brick or lead, as being real and tangible, and of fluffy,
light, floating things as approaching an intangible condition; yet here
we are affirMing that stuff which is far More dense than lead or stone
cannot be touched at all," · just for that very r eason. Either we are
talking nonsense, or our habitual commonsense view of the world is very
naive. ·To get straig4tened out on this we shall have to ask ourselves
a few questions, ·
COMPRESSED TO INVISIBILITY.
Let us suppose we have before us two SMall cubes,. one of eork and
the other .of lead and each the same oize, one. inch ip ·each direction.
The lead cube weighs more (the pull or push of gravity on it is greater
than on the cork)~ and has more mass (which. refers to the quantity of
matter in it); but it has the same over-all volume as -the other cube.
Now imagine that we can exert a very. powerful pressure on all sides at
once:, of this lead cube, so that it i3 compressed.. That means that the
·particles of lead are forced a little closer together. Imagine this
pressure conti~ued and increa3ed until the cube becomes a. half inch,
a quarter inch, or a 16th of an inch in dimensions. Imagine it decreas-
e·d~ to pin-point size, and then to a point '~here it becoM.es Microscopic,
invisible. All of the original cube is there; all of its mass and
weight: only the volume he.s changed .. Suppa se this ultra·-rnicroscopic
cube is hurled ag~!n~t the cube of cork. W~ll the latter stop it? This
enormously heavy and extremely s~all particle will pass through the
loose structure of the cork as if it were not there at all. The cubic
inch of lead, by virtue of becoming thousands of times more dense than
~he cork~ by the process of reducing its voluMe, penetrates the lesser
density with ease.
l~hat else has happened inside the ~ube of lead as it was - compres-
sed? Leaving aside all the books-full of fact and theories about the
·atom, _let us concentrate on· the single fact that every constituent par-
ticle Df the lead is believed to be in motion. When a particle move~
it bas a track or path; there is distance involved; and also speed or
rate of movement. Sup~ose ·you have a pointer of some kind which is
switched back and forth across a dial, · say a one-foot, one-way movement
in one second. Cut the one-foot motion down to six inches without chang-
ing spe.ed. The pointer will then cover the saJ"I\e distance in the same
time, . but it will pass over a six-inch space twice, instead o~ over the
12-inch space once. It w5.11 have a beat or frequency of two, as a re-
sult of shortening its path. Now when we coMpress the cube of lead we
may conceive that the paths or tracks of the motion of its particles
are shortened in some way; their speed is not cha.nged but . their fre-
quency o£ vibration rate is increased. The lead remains lead but the
electrons and nuclei of the ·atoms are a trifle clos~r together. If we
kept the ~ube i~ its original size but pressed more lead into it, the .
effect would be the saAe; the density would be increased, and so would
ita mass and weight.
- 9 -
We have used the word !P-eed, and properly speaking this ~eans rate
of motion in any direction. Speed is ~easured on a scale and has ~ag- •.
nitude only7 but velocity h~s both magnitude and direction (a vector
quantity). If we ~ change either speed or ~irection we get a change of
velocity. These are questions of correct mathel"tatical ·usage; but all
we· are trying to do here is a little crude picture-thinking, to see how
the density of l"\atter is related to the speed or velocity or vibration
rate of its particles. Density is the quantity of matter per unit vol•
ume. Increased density and increased speed of the atomic particles go
together. · Mass increases with velocity and with decrease of size. Cur
ultra-microscopi~ lead cube has an enormous mass, a very small size,
and a very high. velocity of its particles, and a high dens~ty. These
cha.racteristica will Make it penetrative, so that it 'Will go through

THE LO\vER END OF THE SPECTRUJ-f 0,tc' TANGIBILITY
It' should be clear by this til'le, that if we take any substance,
any object, and make it extrel"tely dense, we decrease its volume ~ntil
we cannot see it or touch it. At a certain dcns~ty we reach the lower
end of the "spectr':lm of tangibility" and of .seeable colors.
t.
We spoke on a previous page of the fac~ that the so-called dense
matter of our world is really a rarefaction, a kind of thinning out of
some kind of very dense stuff called space, or the ethers. But when
w~ talk about coMpressing a cubic inch of lead down to a size where it
is invisible, we see~ to be offending. commo~ s~nse again. Even if th~
lead is a ·"rarefaction", you May say, it can hardly be as tenuous and
rarefied as all that. But let us look at this in the light of scien-
tific facts. Suppose an atom to be so enormously enlarged, with all its
distances kept in proportion, so .that the o~bit of the electron (if it
has an orbit) has a diaMeter equal to that of the earth about the sun,
say 184 ~illion miles, On that ~cale the diameter of the electron itself
will be only ' 2000 miles, and the dia~eter of the nucleus, where mass and
weight chiefly ·lie, can be taken as two miles only. A- central mass t't,•O
miles thick, another object 2000 J!\iles thick at a distance of some 92
raillion miles.! Evidently, plenty of rool"t insi de this systeM. And what
do we Mean ~y ~? We do not Mean nothingness 1 but space -- and space
is not nothing. It is identifiable 'dth the ether(s), and the ether is
matter of extreme density. It is so dense that we cannot see or feel
it, and its friction as it flows through the· kind of m~tter we do see
and touch is so minute that our instruments ~ave net yet detected it
with certainty. In this dense matter, inside the systert of any atom or
congregation of atOJ'I\S of our world, there ?'lay be other worlds, a~d ,,"'rlds
~~thin these also -- world ~~thout end.
The physicist will say that for him the centers of the atof.'ls, th~
nuclei, seldo~ approach each other MUCh closer than one anijs~rom, which
is a hundred-Millionth of a centimeter. A negative electron has a Gia-
rneter Qf about 35 Millionths of an inch, so that it would truce about
301 000 electrons, touching each other, to Measure one angstrom and reach
from one nucleus . to another. Consider the comparative vastness of the
space which separates-and-unites the parts of the atom. It was to ill-
ustrate this that ~e magnified the atom rnatheJ'11atically in ~he la~t para-
graph. How J'11a.ny' other atoms m
.ay lurk unseen in these huge, stellar
inter-spaces]
- 10 -
W~ spoke of the nucleus of the atom as holding nearly all of its
mass and weight. The lightest ato~ is hydrogen, and its mass is nearlr
1840 times that of .a negative electron. But it ·is not larger in v·olume,
let us take good note of that. "The larger the Mass the smaller the
diameter11 is axiomatic in present-day science. The negative electron
has the greatest !ill~ of any individual body in the atom.
"If the distance fro~ center to center of nearest atoms is, say,
two angstroms," writes Crehore i~ "Atol"\i.c Theory" (1942) "and if t·he
I .
negative electron is of the order of lo-13 {or 1 over 10 plus 13 cijh-
ers) the volumes are to each. other as the cubes of these figures, or
1olS (10 plus lS ciphers).. That is to say, the volume of the atom is
1olS tiMes as l"lUch as the volume of one single negative electron."
A diaMond is a very de~se subst~nce (3·. 55 times as dense as wate~) •
Suppose we cou1d put such pressure on a di~~ond that it was crowded
into a d~nsity equal to that attributed · t~ the star Wolf 457 ~-or to :
500 million times the density of water. \·lolf,_ by the way, ~as a 1'1\ass
60 times that of our sun but is only about half the size of our Moon,
some 3000 miles in diameter -- "The greater the Mass the smaller thi .
diameter". Well, a c~bic inch of our condensed di~mond (or of the star
mentioned) would weigh about 9000 tons on our earth. Yet the nuclei
of its atoms would still be distnnt from each other, from 10-10 to 10-11
centimeters. This means that the distance between the nuclei of its
atoms would still be bet~"een 10 and 100 times the dia~eter .of the
atom itself. ·
Do we still think that our cugic inch of lead is already highly
condensed, too denae to be co~pressed very much? Or that there is no
room inside it, inside the systems of its atoms?
THE LAND OF ETHERIA
This is the land of Etheria, Eden-land and ho~eland of our ~ace.
Theosophical writer·s have used a helpful illustration. Fill a large
bucket with large stones, then ~th STI\all stones, pebbles and gravel
thrown in also. Add sand to the bri~ful, then you can still add water
in coneiderable a~ounts. All these things, in a sense, and if by ~Raa!
you J!\ean the si21e and sh~pe of the bucket, are in the ~!!m£ space. So
if our world be a sand grain, note how many other worlds great and small
may be in the same cosmic container along w.ith it. Not a very accurate
illustration, of course, Things do not really occupy the same place;
it . is only that the enor~ous places we call empty are all filled up.
~orget about the atOMS for a moMent ~nd look about you in common, three-
dimensional space. How MUch of it is filled, even to our sense percep~
tions? Do you really think that there is !12!h!E,g bet1'1'een you and the
wall yo~der, or the tree, the city, the Mountain in the distance, the
height of the sky ~verhead?
Does the idea of nothingness make any sense, if indeed one can
have such an idea at all? No philosopher has ever ~ade profit from such
a eoncept. nout of ·the '\·oid" we read, this or that issued forth; but
again, ex nihilo nihil fit; and froM Nothing no· ~in£ -was ever born.
11
Even the scientists, wary of picture-thinking, were gravelled by this
difficulty. Actio i~ distans, they used to call it -- or the problem
of action at a distance.
HAGNETISM AN ETHERIC PHENOMENA
Hold a J'llagnct over a nail and a miracle occurs,, the nail · jump's as
if prodded by demons, yet "nothing" seems to connect the two. "''~ell
then·
,·n reasons the experimenter, "we shall have to invent some.thing to
connect them." .(Just as, "if there were no God man would need t ·o invent
one.") \v.e shall invent, or rather postulate the ether. A postulate,
if you please, is a necessary assumption.
Lines of force, stresses, a M?.gnetic field, all make it necessary
to asSUMe a space-filling mediUM. And this cos~ic filler-in, or postu-
late, or ether, was for a long tiMe au iTn1"1ense convenience, also an iJn-
mense eMbarrassment. It "'aS neoes s-ary, and it was inconsistent, mat'ter
and non-Matter, stuff and not-stuff. Came Einstein, caMe the dawn (or
did it?) and a great sense of liberation with him. 1-fatheJ'I\atically
speaking the ether was no longer necessary; we can use the concept of
space ins.tead. That shut one Pandora box, even while it opened anothEr
one. If the mathematicians ~re relieved, philosophers and metaphysicians
have hardly shifted their ground.
One curious fact caMe to light in connection with the developJ'Ilent
of Einstein's equations. The ~ass of a body (the quantity of Matter in
it) increases with velocity, when the velocity approaches that of light.
Mas~ therefore is a function of velocity. If voluTne remains constant,
and the velocity and hence the mass be increased, the density, or quan-
tity of ~atter per unit volu~e, is also incre~sed. This obviously re-
state·s much of what we have ~aid about the na-ture of density and . of the
etherie worlds. r
But to go back to the nothingness which lies between you and the .
mountain yonder, or between your eye and your outstretched band -- as
i{ !lllhing could !i_.£ anywhere! \•li tb such . a concept, or alleged concept,
you cannot ~bink at all. You Merely cease thinking and utter certain
~·erbal sounds. Rosicrucians have a phrase for it: ttSpace is the unper-
ceived aspect of Real~ty.n ~ere basically still, it is a form or aspect
or condition of consciousness which attends on e~perience.
\ve muDt refuse this inviting by-path, which "'ould lead us as far as
the galaxies at least, and humbly invite you to sit do:wn and look at
space for a few minutes -- even if you cant see .itZ Stop looking through
it at the thing beyond, and try looking into it instead. If you practise
this a bit you'll begin to see the graining of it, soMething like heat
waves but not in motion. That is said to be the aura and maybe it is:·
but itts ' a profitable hint. If you kept on looking, conditioning your .
eyes, you might learn to see ~nany things in this "nothingnesstt, m.aybe
even an Etberean friend or two occasionally, o·r "rrarvellous cities
builded in the blue" as do the Hindu seers. But dont make the mistake
of telling psychiatrists, medical Men and psychologists about this; !OU
have three guesses why.

III
Since, to repeat, this 'l:i'ooklet is issued in what we conceive to be
the public · inte!est, it is i~portant to avoid the appearance of serving
any particular creed or cult or School or other organization. ''~e are
dealing with an intensely practical and factual situation -- the visi-
tati:on. of the· ether craft (Flying Saucers) -- and with pro.bleJI'tS arising
fro'l'\ it. The wr.iter an.d hi.s associate's believe they have an explanation
of these craft which is basically correct; and it ·is their hope that it
will be eXBJI'tined in the ~ight of all available data, and also fro~ a
rigidly scientific point of view. .. They have used inforMation froT" every
possible source, and SO'I'\e_of these sources would doubtless be discredited
a priori by Many readers. No one, however, is asked to respect such
sources, or any alleged authority, per se, but only to listen critic~lly
to what is said if his interest is sufficient, and thereafter to forM
his 'own opinion •
. Those who wish a simple stateMent of the ~ain issues involving the
Disc problem will perhaps find all they care for in Section I of this
booklet. Those who care to .go a little further into the scientific ·
concepts will find theM sketched in Section II. But it is almost cer-
tain that these ether craft were known in antiquity, and that at least
a few persons of unusual training or gift3 have always understood th~ir
origin and purposes. And it is entirely certain, and a familiar fact,
that the ancients knew a good deal about Etheria, that is, about the
etheric "planes" or worlds ,, Whether the reader has .any interest or con-
fidence in this lore, is his o~n business. Bu~ from ou~ point of view~
A!! data, real or alleged, about Etheria is p~rtincnt and contributory,
and we believe a good many people are interested in it. l·le therefore
devote a few paragr£phs in ·this section II~ to this topic.
In doing this we shall simply quote excerpts fro~ a booklet pre-
viously issued, "The l..fystery of the Flying Discs", 1-feade Layne, BSRA,
June 19481 wlthout atte~pting to organize the Material. The whole of
this present booklet, in fact, has been compiled under difficulties and
makes no pretense at skillful presentation. The quotat~ons follow•
. "You ask, trf this i~probable Etheria really exists, how is it that
we do ·not know about it?' \vell, it has been known, in varying degrees,
to adepts and initiates and occultists for thousands of years. It is
like scores of other facts of great importance, the coMmons have never
understood nor really want~d to understand. There has always been a
store of secret knowledge in the world. In fact all advanced technical
knowledge is secret in a sense, to all except the few who can .understand
and apply it. Of course, Etheria is incredible! It happens to be a
new fact, a new light on the horizon so far as coi'lmon knowledge is con-
cerned. X-rays and ~adar and the radio and atoMic fission and a score
or a hundred ~ore are incredible new facts also, yet it is likely they
were known in old time. But if ~edible and iMEossib!! mean the same
to you, we are wasting your time. • •
"For those interested in what .is called occult or esoteric ideas
- 13 -
and philosophy, the subject of etheria is fa~iliar. The various Schools·.
e~ploy varying terMinology and different classifications of the planes
and worlds, but their basic concepts are very similar as far back as we
have any infor~ation about the~ . Perhaps the most faMiliar classifica-
tion of .the ethers is four-fold, and includes the (1) chemical ether,
(2) the life ether , (3) the reflecting ether . These appear to be dif-
ferent aspects of the etheric world, and it is through them that all
the forces of life flow into the organic forMs of plants, animals, and
~en. And Coryts translation of 'Ancient Fragments' quote·s one of the
Chaldean oracles as saying, 'From the ether have cQme all things, and
-to it all things return; the images of all things ~re impressed upon it;
it is the storehouse of the germs or reJ~tain,s of all ,risible forl'ts and
even of ideas.' H.P. Blavatsky writes in 'Isis Unveiled', Vol. I page
~84: 'The universal ether, in the eyes of the ancients, was a boundleus
ocean peppled like our faMiliar seas with creatur.es large and s~~ll ; and
having th~ germs of life in every molecule. • • here too dwelt the ve~­
ious races of elemental spirits.' (page 310) 1The privation cif a form
(i.e., ita abstract idea) when transl'litted to the ether, becol'\es mater-
ial. ' References to this topic of the ethers, however, in 'Isis Unveil"
ed' and . 'The Secret Doctrine' appear to be very .few. • • u

"Phy·si cally considered 1 these 'planes t are distinguished by varying
ratesot vibration; spiritually considered they are varying states of
consciousness. ·
"Substance · as e~~th men know it ·
takes on · the tangibility· suited to
· earth consciuusnes~ on the lower
etherie, and it is · fro~ this region
that your sky phenomena burst into
view, and also your physical psychic
.phenomena. At death, ~an's sojourn
in the lower etheric is very short-
lived . But he does not enter the
higher etheric, but goes right. on ·
through it, wi t·h no consciousness of .
it, to the lower astral. Later, and
depending on his ~ental ac~ivity, he
enters the high~r spheres of the
astral. ~ut in order to ~ake any
contact other than mental, he ~ust
~ake it through and by the lower
etheric."
The reader should observe the
extent to which the "sphere" or '"plane11
of the physical world is interpenetrated by
the etheric regions. All material· existents of our plane issue froJ'l\
the etheric and become materialized for our s enses. And when a human
.being reincarnates, he ~ust enter the lower etheric levels of matter in
order to do so - - thus obeying the common la,~. Etheric rnatter, like the
~atter of the still higher levels, is susceptible of being moul~ed by
the energy-action of thought. Dwellers on the etheric construct ·dwell-
ings, houses, sky-craft by !h!nkiag out the pattern, and drawing into
it 'the beav.i er particles of ~atter. 411 objects of our. world have be-en
created in this way, ty ~an himself. (Now .to continue with the original

CONCERNING THE LOKAS
As we have pointed out elsewhere, these sky pheno~ena have a great
many forms, an~ the word Disc describes only one type of them. A generic
na~e covering all the shapes or types has long been needed, and the BSRA
publications, several years ago, proposed the word Loka, or Lokas; whe-
ther or not this term can be acclimati:ed1 it brings up the Loka idea or
concept as it exi~ts in Oriental philosophy. It. is worth while saying a
few words about this because E~heri a , the etheric worlds or planes, a&d
the Lokas are to a considerable extent identifiable. It may be helpful
to SOJ'I\e of us, if we clearly understand that Etheria1 and the ether-
ships, and etherian peoples are a~ new knowledge in· the world, but have
been known for thousands of years; they· are merely new to~ because of
our ignorance.

II•
The word Loca itself is originally no nore thon the Latin locus;
a place. A Devaloca is the place of the Devas, and Kamalooa is the
·place of ICama or de$ire. In Theosophical usage it is about equivalent
tc 'world' or 'sphere' or. 'plane'. Another word, Tala, is inseparably
connected with Loka, and may be understood as t'he f'\ater.ial aspect of the
latter. In occult thinking, every .plan·e has an inner and an outer as•
pect. Here · on earth, for example, we have a type or form of conscious-
·nesa which functions in a certain way, and also the ~atter or substance
or kind o.f manifestation With which· this form o·f consciousness can deal.
This corresponds to the terms .subJe.£.!i.Y! and .obj ectiV;!, and roughly to
the distinction between Loka and Tala also. . The two aspects ~re as in-
~epare.ble as the two pol.es ·.or a magnet. And it .is cus'tol'l'\ary in exoteric
philosophy to refer to the Lokas or toka-Talas as being seven in number.
These are often thought of as spheres concentric ~th our globe. The
f.irst was said to extend to the upper lif'lits of our atmosphere. The
~recor,d as far as the Pole Star and including the planets.
"The etheric worlds or Lekas are regarded as spacial and. temporal
regions of existence which interpenetrate with our· world of {more rare-
fied) matter, and also, in their higher. aspects, with the lower levels
of the astral. Our physical plane · includes the lower and higher etheric,
but some four-fifths of this lies outside our nor~al range of sense per-
ception. In this etheric region there flourish civilizations and cul-
tur.es, and a race of beings which are born into that world and die th~re.
They are NOT excarnate hu~ans . They · ha~e knowledge of our world and can
and c;lo penetrate it. Many .dwellers on the astral ·plane are aware of the
etheric worlds also, and have the power of visiting the~. This ability
however, does not seem to be a. coJ'IImon and natural endowment, but belongs
to persons of a certain degrqe of develop~~nt~ corresponding to those
who~ we here· call Adepts, or possessed of exceptional psychic powers of
projection or clairvoyance. Anyone, in short, can fun~tion on any plane
for which ~e is prepared, and astral vision and as~ral travelling is
fairly common because of our interest in the after~death ' life; but the
etheric regions have been little explored. Yet they are in Many ways
the ~ost i~portant of all, since they hold the key to ALL the phenomena
of our earth life, and to the origin and history of our race••• n
A HtJlfBLE BEGINNING NECESSARY
It is ·certain that exploration of the etheric regions has been
greatly neglected even among Western occultists, probably for the reason
tn ~ntione·d in the foregoing paragraph, and the whole subject is practic-
ally a sealed mystery to \-Jester·n science. Although as has been said,
it was found necessary to invent an ether as a universal medium, if
"action e.t a distance" was to be m
·
ade intelligible. The first task con-
fro~ting usi then, in dealing with the phenomena of the Discs, is to
accu1ttom ourselves to the ·concept of an etheric wcrld and people, here
among us and close at hand, and .to learn all that has been learned and
ta-ught in the past concerning this world, not di saaining to start with
A. and B, but with D and E as perhaps not i~possible goals.

Part of the purpose of this information booklet is to stimulate
i~terest in the scientific problems tnvolved. In spite .of a policy of
secrecy and an unofficial censor ship, it is wid.
ely believed by this,
ti~e that a number of ether ships of the Disc type have landed in the
United States, through accident of soMe kind. We have no ~epQrts that
any of the dwarf occupants survived the landing, and we are told that
the propulsion· and control of these craft is very MJICh of a puz.zle to
scientists who have inspected theM. They are said to .be without ~otors,
propellers, or anything recognizable as a drive mechanisM. Thi~ sug-
ge~ts, of course, soMe kind · of magnetic propulsion. ·
The perfor~anee of these craft; their extraordinary speed, power
and maneuverability far outclasses anything our own engineers have been
able to achieve.. Any race or nation possessing s·uch aircraft could ·
easily attain dominance of the skies and of the world whenever they so
desired. Thus from both a practical and a theoretical standpoint it is
of supre'l'!e importance that their secret b'e attacked with every resource
of present day knowledge.
Various articles h_
ave appeared gl.VJ.ng elaborate descriptions· of
pussible drives and controls used by the ether craft, but the absence cf
all such rnechenis~ fro~ the landed discs (if correctly reported) disposes
of these conjectures. Nothing has been proposed so far which even begins
to satisfy the observed facts, and it is the belief of this writer that
principles are involved which are not yet lmown to cont·ernporary science.
Furthermore, it is likely to take an unusu~lly enlightened and tolerant
type of scientific mind to grasp these principles, even if and when
they can be explicitly stated. It is a pity, for instance, · that t"
he
-energic character of metal, or psychic · action {telekinesis), so abundant-
ly demonstrated cannot be allowed its place in the· domain ·of fi'IOdern phy-
si.cs.
Telekinesis refers . to the move~ent of objects without known contac~
or emplo~.ent of any recognized fore~ or energy. The literature is ex-
tsnaive, but those who are interested may consult the six olosely print -
ed pag·es in Nandor Fodor's "Encyclopedia of Psychic Science", article on
}fovement. (Arthur's Press, London, 1933) .
Such energies will be recognized by the science of the future; but
meanwhile any attempt to import such considerations even into our fast-
developing super- physics wlll meet with derision. In fact, only ·the
free-lance phy sicist:. owning no allegiance to anything except the search
for truth and indifferent to attack, will dare to suggest agencies of a
peychic or psychological order.
It is in the hope of stimulating the interest of such free spirits
.in this critical problem of borderland research that we print the fo1low-
ing paragraphs, admittedly tentative and suggestive only~ contributed t.o
this bookly by Associates for whose mathematical and scientific attain-
ments we have the highest respect.

ter is possible; it depends on bow one look$ at it . According to the '·
occultists, the ethers are si~ply a large r ange of physical ~atter which·
we are not aware of as substance, and are only partially aware of as
force. Of the seven divisions of the physical plane only three are sub-
stantial to our consciousness; the remaining four are etheric ~atter.
It in the three lower divi~ions so~ e 92-odd ele~ents are found, and a~
almost li~itless co~bination of these, · with resulting properties almost
fant,.stic in their nature, how mu.ch more will be found in the re~aining
tour divisions of the physical world referred to as etheric?
CRYSTALLINE ETHERIC STRUCTURES
"A combination of ethe.ric elernents (or say, higher ph.ysical sub-
stances) may provide · a substance jelly- like - to our range· of consc.ious-
neas, and rather dense and solid to an Etherean. This would transmit
unidirectionally through its substance shock waves generated by alter-
nate applications of heat and cold. I think such a substanc·e would have
a crystalline structure: that is, all its .ato~s would be arranged in an
exact geo~etric pattern with respect to each other.
ItSuppose we had an etheric ·atom. with an octahedral shape, in which
a nucleus vibrated along one of the three diagonals. Suppose the normal
place of the atom is at B; a shock wave passes at an angle and the ·par-
ticle at B literally ju~ps to A and delivers the energy of its ~otion
to the whole atom in the direction of vector v.

well be in the thousands of ~iles per hour. That ~o~ld depend on how
fast the shuttle J'I'IOtion could take place.
S·
HOCK ·WAVES ASTRAL?
"There· are also ·the energy considerations. The shock wave ·"'ay be
astral in· origin as respects the Disc, and that may be why we cant do
-it with el:ectronics. That shock wave may impart to the shuttling atom
an energy of one or more electron volts. Translated into· atomicmotion
along the vector,the aggr~gate of energy in the substance ·could be sev-
eral millions of volts (electromotive force) presenting a thrust of
rnany thousands of pou~ds in a giv~n direction• . One hates to think what
would happen if all those octahedral ato"'a got pointed in different dir-
eotiQns. But then, the shock wave may be a controlling factor on that.
Juat the proper angle of approach to the ato~ ~uat hold before the
little atom will shuttle. Not only that, but the frequency of the shock
wave J'I"IUSt correspond exactly 1dt~1 the length of the shuttle path and the
vector epeed of the octahedral e.tom~ Arith"'etically, th·e velocity V
· of the whole atom equals the quot~ent of the mass of the shuttle atom x,
ita .velocity divided by the "'ass of the whole atom: V a ~v/ M. In fact,
the nucleus or shuttle atoM as we call it has the greater portion of the
mass of the whole; the speed of the whole would become ~eater than that
of the nucleus and the . latter would be without. further effect. Another
reason why physical arran.gementa do not responed in that way to such
stimulation. The inner particle of this etheric atOJ"'\ !'lUSt consist of
less "'ass than the outer shel~ or structure.
nThis idea is inverse to the concept that the nucleus of the atom
has moat of the J'l"lass. The perceptibility of ~atter, to ~y way of think-
ing, depends upon the arrange"'ent of its basic particles in any given
atoJI't.· Atoms with heavy shells and light nucleii may be imperceptible
to physical senses but quite visible to the clairvoyant faculty.
"There is no reason to think that a Disc on beconting visible to us
undergoes any basic ato~ic changes. He keep laboring .under. the· delusion
that the etheric is another plane. The visibility of the discs J'l"lay be
d~e to the adhering of physical debris, dust and the like, to the sur-
face of its shell, drawn· in by the fields created in its propulsion
machanism. They rnay have means of blowing the stuff off, hence their
appearance and disappearance, trails of smoke, fire, etc. Ho~ever, when
one of them 'cracks up' we are confronted w.ith a quite different condi-
tion. It's bard to tell what the release· of nuclear energies would
do to the substance of the ship in a case of lost control. An atom w~th
a. light nucleus may be a "'ighty hungry fellow ~hen its mode· of control
is g~ne, and might well get itself a heavy nucleus and absorb or release
a great deal of energy in doing so -- ·enough to do the occupants a
golden brown1
"Now, about that 'soMet!iing to push on' idea. Not necessarilv•
..
Rockets move in a vacuu~ by reaction of the inertia of one Mass with
enother. The shuttle atom does soJ"'\ething of the sa~e thing. The
(astral) shock wave coJ"'\ing at right angles presents no reaction1 it being
on a higher level simply energizes the one particle in the whole ato~;
that moves forward along i1:s path of least , resistance until it again
meets resistance at the opposite apex. There the energy of ita J"'\O~entum
- 21 -
is delivered to the whole atoM and it falls back ~nto its place again.
Since the kick co~es froM the shock wave external to itselfJ and which
affects only the shuttle ato~, there is no kick-back to the whole ato"'•
~h~ _ shock waves are trans~itted on the absolute ether (as are physical
light and heat). And since .·everY., any and all ato~ic s'tructures are <tl
floating in that same ether, waves are necessary to make. the ·atOJ'I\S g;.::

OVER 9,000 HILES PER HOUR
In line with Hilliard's final remark above, here's a summary. of
a OFO sighting by a technical obser.vatory, from page 193 of Keyhoeta·
book, "Flying Saucers lrom Outer Space": "I just got a report from u
ionosphere observatory," I shoyed hiM the naJI'Ie, which the officials
had asked me not to publish. "They track the lower ionosphere layer·s
by radar, and it records any changes on a chart. One night (In Dece~ber
.1952) they were tracking the E layer, over 50 miles up, and suddenly
the radar picked up a t~rrific disturbance. The needle jumped all over
the chart. SoJ'!\e experts analyzed the tracing later and they said that
·. a so.lid object, flying a straight course, had passed over the station .
at between nine and ten thousand ~ilea an hour·. • • The chart showed
the ionosphere in a violent col'U'notio·n, apparently upset by so"'e power-
ful electrical force. It didn't get back to nor~al for over 30 Minutes,
and any air turbulence fro~ the thing's pas~age should have died down
long before that."

rate than ours, since they must long ago have evolved out of such non-· .
sense as technological secrecy and security, and have done away witn
national boundaries and other artificial bP.rriers. So~e of their craft
are undoubtedly experim~ntal. It is practically certain that their_in-
··tereat in our pla~e- has been increased by the explosion .of atoT'\ic bombs.
An obvious question is: - why dont they try to make contact with us in
ao~e way? The answer probably is, that they have been and are in contact
with us to a degree which serves all their present objectives. All they
need to know is probably picked up by them through various communication
devices, plus certain advanced ~eans of psychic and telepathic percep-
tion. The torrents of rnat~rial constantly being poured out by our radio
stations on a world scale are of course open to them, and this alone
would enable the"' to evalu·ate our culture and civ.ilization.
Some As12ects of Ethetl~: "We f"USt not harbor the illusion that ·
the four etheric states are ghostly and unsubstantial. They are a good
deal more substanti-
al than our so-called dense world, and it is we-wh·o•re
the' ghosts of the Etheric realm. The distance be~ween the atOJilS of our
bodies and of all objects are as great in proportion as the distances
bewteen the .stars. And I have reason to postulate, on evidence which
has co"'e to my attention, that the force of gravity in Etheria 7'\ay be
twice that of our plane. Thus the navigators of etherian craft, in our
atmosphere and sphere of gravitation, would experience a freedo"' of
movement which they ~ust learn to guard against. ·
"There is reason to suppose, also, that the lowe3t of the etheric
·states, just beyond our gases, serves as a zone of demarcation between
the planes, and that there -is so~e overlap of phenomena of the etheric
and of our world of ~atter, in this zone. Etheric matter will inter-
penetrate all things of our world (etheric doubl~s). Our sense of
touch, pain, and temperature difference ~anifests through one or "'ore
of the etheric count~rparts of our bodies. Drug~ and anesthetics affect
us through the sa~e means. By means of hypnotism the functional inter-
relation of the et~eric double can be "'odified or even su~pended. It
will al"'o :Jt .certainly be discovered that J'l!any diseases ori-
ginate in
this etheric counterpart of the human organisT'\.
· ttit will be accepted eventually, that certain laws of electronics
function via one or more of the etheric states of rtatter. Certain nu-
clear and/or subnuclear physical particles or nucleons, it will be
found, pass into and out of one o~ ~ore of the etheric states of 7'\atter.
And. it is this fact which adds so much to the perplexities and bewilder-
11\ent of our orthodox ato~ic scienticts and ~atheT'\atical longhairs. _They
have lately in their researches entered into a paradoxical Alice in
Wonderland realJil of .physics. This makes little or no sense within the
framework of their. scientific logic. They note how nuclear particles
seem to pop out of nowhere and vanish without a trace, in an infinites-
imal fraction of a second soMeti~s. The question as tQ whether an elec-
tron is a wave or a particle still defies orthodox physical logic -and
sense. The state of being and structure of an electron has been deduced
to a composite blur, and neither its velocity nor its location can -be
known simultaneously with the other f actor. It is not yet known why
the protons within an atomic nucleus., . each with a positive charge., can
snuggle together for billions of years in some ele~ents, without being

ETHERIA, HO~fE PLANE OF THE ETHER SHIPS
co~ents of Associate Edward Se Schult4, Buffalo, ~ew York. His
Foreword states that his· ~oncepts are arrived at by a correlation of .
orthodox science, l'1etaphysics, and his own J"'\etbod of Equimatic analysls,
yet ••the ra~ifications of the subject are so coJ"'\plex and unprecedented
that only trail-bla~ing gen~rali~ations are possible in a sho~t article."
· Associate Schult: has held a number of highly responsible po~itions in
organized research, and is author of the BSRA booklet, "Provisional
AtoJT~ic Researchtr. .(Now out of print.) ·
The Ether Pl~: "There is aJY~ple evidence and authoritative opin-
ion that this is a septenary universe, i.e., "'anifesting 'in nuMerical
divisions and relationships of seven. This thread of evidence runs
thru scie~ce, religion, occultis~, art, Metaphysics, and philosophy.
T~ere is also evidence that above and beyond the ·solid, liquid and gas-
eous states of matter there are four stat~of etheric matter, each dif-
fering fro,.., the states above and below it. This has been recognized for
centuries in the ~eachings of certain Schools and religions. We have a
limited awareness of the first three states, but are oblivious of the
other four except under highly specialized conditions. There is, it is
true, soMe evidence of etheric phenomena becoming recognized by physical
r~search, but on the vhole they are, to us, a ghostly realm which does
net respond to ordinary laboratory ~ethods and instrumentation. Yet it
must be self-eTident that ihere is plenty of rooM for separate plan~a
or worlds of physical ~anifestation in the four etheric states just out
of our ~inary reach. It is these· regions, coexistent with and inter-
penetrat~~g· our~~ plane, that are r~ferrcd . to under the ter~ Etheriae
Ethet'i~n · Scie~: "Not only MUst the ethelic plane be postulated,
but the ab1lnd~nt and irr-efutable ·observ'ation of thousands of persons, of
Flying Sa~cers and other related phenonena gives evidence of the reality
of tlie etheric ' wcirlds, and that it is inhatiited by beings at lea~t
several centuries ahead of us· in science, and probably in other respects
as well. Their flying craft are iM~easurea'bly ahead of ours. They make
the transition fnm one plane to another, are independent of the air fvr
3upport or propulsion, are highly Maneuverable and can travel at speeds
up to thouscinds of Miles per hour- There is r~ason to suppose that they
can a~d do t~avel to other planets of our solar syste,..,: and it is highly
probable that if they are attacked or sufficiently provoked they can re-
taliate in a Manner which WOUld churn the n~wspapers and radio Stations
of the w6rld into a frenzy of ~ystification and fear. Although these
craft have been with us a longer time than MOSt of us suspect, our o~m
science and technology, military and other~~se, have only recently enter-
ed into an era in which SOY"1e of our develop~ents (radar, A-boMbs, etc. )
are beginning to manifest .to the Etherians, in degrees ranging from a
nuisance to a Menace.
ttThe science and engineering of Etheria is doubtl~ss subject to
continued . progress and iMprovement, but (we may conjecture) at a faster
- 23 -
, blown apart by mutual repulsion. Obviously, orthodox physics is fast
approaching an impasse which will require that the laws of nature be
interpreted in terms of all ~~ of the physical states of ~atter.
After this is recognized we shall begin, very slowly, to cat.ch up with
Etheria -- home plane of the Flying Discs.
THEORIES Oi ETHER CRAFT PROPULSION
"The speed, the control, and the acceleration powers of these craft
bring up questions which are not . merely academic but intenseiy practical.
If we knew but part of the secret it would advance our knowledge by ·
decades if not by c~nturies. For the pres~nt we have the following
avenues of investigation:
A. The reported appearance and behaviour of all varieties of ether craft
so far observed.
3. The above, analyzed in terms of orthodox science and engineering.
o. The above (A) analyzed in terMS of borderland sciences · and including
metaphysics, constituting a highly specialized and advanced source of

E. It is hoped that to the foregoing will be added in due t~e an exam-
ination at close quarters of one or ~ore of the ether craft, in case one
or ~ore of them is grounded for any reason -- an event ~ich may have
already occurred.
uone major difficulty in so~ving the secret of the drive, is the
fact that these craft almost certainly have more than one kind of pro-
pulsion, and that these are interchang~d in accord with conditions or
the medium in which they operate~ in and out of our at~osphere. So~e
~ay be propelled in accord with certain objectives or experimental re-
quirements. The~e arc generalizations which are bound to be narrowed
down with the passage of time ..
"In working toward this worthy and difficult objective, BSR Asso-
ciate john A Hilliard recently blazed a brilliant trail of analysis in
the presentation of his high-frequency heat-flow principle, outlined in
another part of this booklet.
HATERIALIZATION AND DEHATERIALIZATION, t!!! AND DEMAT
"At this .writing, and in accord ~. th Etherian physics the following
generalized ·theory 1
of possible propulsion is advanced: When Etheria
solved the problem of transition frcm their plane to ·ours via their
ether craft, that is, materialization ·into our world, ·the principle May
have solved the problem of propulsion at the same time! The laws of
quantum mechanics apply to all plane~ of ~anifestation. It is plain
that materialization and deJ!\aterialization would proceed in terms of
- 25 -
qu~nta. i.e., in exceedingly SJ'I\all or fine jerks.. The process could be · .
made to alternate at will, and the quanta involved wuuld alternate at ·
very high frequency. If, after complete materializatio~, the fore and.
aft ends of the craft were caused to "mat" and 11 demat" alternately at
,·
high 1
frequencr, a propulsive effect would come into · play.
DIRECTIONAL FL0\'1
·., ·"Let us suppose that the craft as a whole stays materialized but
that only a relatively thin. layer of. the fore and .aft parts· undergo
th·e Jttat and deJI'\at cycle. As long as this cycle were J'llaintained in phase
no, propelling effect would. come into play. ·
A BALAN
CED, IN PHASE CYCLE OF l'AT AND DEl-1AT
"However, as soon as the Disc pilot put the cycle out of phase . in
favor of either the fore or aft sections, one part of the craft would
be ~aterializing as fast as the other would be dema terializing, and the
aum .total effect would be a flow in any desired direction; although,
sinc·e this flow would be interiY!s of quanta, involving but S'l'lall surface
sectiQna of the craft, it would be in a sense analogous to the Aode of
travel of· a ceterpillar or inchworM.

"There is still another sense in which ether craf.t can be ·envision-
• · ed as 'flowing' forward. At supersonic speed, which is but a crawl com-
pared to Disc speeds, our aircraft encounter so-called shock waves,
sometimes referred to as a burble. This tends to shake, shock or disin-
teg.rate the aircr.aft. \vithof.lt a doubt, the design and operation of _
the
ether craft iS SUCh that, ·at SUpersonic Speeds and 11'\UCh higher, the
craft flows forward in ph~se with the shock wave or burble and the wave
helps to propel the craft forward. Incidentally, the real secret o~ t~e
so-called shockwave involves .a yet-to-be-discovered principle of physi~s
so unprec.edented· that our high speed plane designers and ope~ators of
super-3onic tunnels will be reluctant to ·believe their own operations or
formuias. However, the Equimatically arrived .at theory concerning this
phenofl\enon would not be in keepin_g w:i th ·the subject 11'\atter of this

ETHER CRAF.T PROPELLING PO\'IER SOURCE
. .
. "It is certain· there are no cheMical processes involved, and that
the source of power is based on an a~Of'lic energy or sub-nuctear.. process.
They have, undoubt'edly and long ago, discovered the secret of releasing
and using atoll'\ic energy without the by-product of radiati.on and radiation
hazards, which our orthodox physicists appear to take for granted as
being forever inevitable. Even now there are ample clues to the release
and us~ of ato~ic power without such hazards; but, there is an officially
decreed blindness on this and other rnatters of similar or greater inter-
est. It is entirely possible and probable that the use of atoMic energy
by ether craft involves the transition of such energy into othe~, inter-
mediate forms, i.e., inter-related £unctions of heat, electricity and
me.gnetism, the nature of '~hich is but dimly suspected in our physics.
"However great our ignorance of Etherian physics, it is entirely
poasible that certain isolated laborator.y discoveries duplicate or fore-
shadow pr.inciples well-kno'm to the Etherians. As one of such glimmers
of progress let us take note of an item appearing in 'Science News Lette#
of Nov. 19, 1949, of which the full text follows:
'New Electronic Torch Can Xelt Tungs.ten: Heat enough to melt tung-
sten, which rnelts ·at 3,370 degrees Centigrade and has the highest melting
;point of all Jrteta.ls, is obtained with a new electronic. torch revealed by
· the Gen·eral Electric Research Laboratory. It utilizes extrel"lely high-
frequency radio waves with such gases as nitrogen or carbon monoxide fed
past the discharge arc.
'As described by Dr·.. J.D. Cobine, G.E. Scientist, the heart of the
torch is a tube kno~~ as a Magnetron which produces radio waves of one
billion cycles p-er second.. Leading froJI'\ the tube is an antenna rnade of
two short J'lletal cylinders, · one within the other. A high•frequency arc ·
can be made to ~orm on one end ·of the antenna. If certain gases are f~d
past the arc, the electronic torch results~ It resembles a jet of fla~e
about n~ne inc~es long. .The high tef!\pera~ures produced on any surface
placed.1~ ;he Jet are caused alMost entirely by the heat generated by
ato~s J01n1ng together to form f!\Olecules, according to Dr. Cobine. The
molecules ~f certain gases are broken up into ato~s by the high frequency
arc. These atoms jqin together again on surfaces plac~d in the torch.

AN INTERPRETATION FROM OCCULT SCIENCE
"Let me ask the reader at this point to compare the toregoing dev-
elopment with stateJ'tents J'ltade in an interview (with a member of the -;-_
.
Inner Circle of trance-rnediuM Mark Probert) summarized below and dealing
with the probleJn of the disc propulsion:
'I want to say that traction, or what would be terRed the pressUre
from the vuter to the inner, or as with wheels on a road, is -created by
t~e magnetic field they throw off -- that is thrown off ~ the bodies
of these· discs. This is true of all of theJ't, including- the for"' that
you call the fire-ball. Yes, they operate outside the atl'iosphere, but
the forM of propulsion there is not different, ·only lower and higher
rates of the same. The propulsion is secured· according to the · condition
they enter into. Atoms are not single atoMs; it is better to say a field
or a pattern or a wave, or surface behaviorisM. There is ·always surface.
Going into the higher ethers there is a denser field; coJ'ting into ·the
earth atmosphere the density grows less••. • The radiation out of which
these craft are built is brought ab~ut by J'ltind ac~ivity; it is hased ~n
the order. of phenomena called teleportation. This process always brings
about extreJ'te heat or .cold. In bringing these J'tanifestationa into being,
heat is first used. After the body takes on the density of 'the earth
plane it starts throwing off heat radiations, heat energy, at a terrific
rat~ of speed. This he~t - strikes at the hydrogen and oxygen atoMS around
the object;·· ·c_
reating what J'ltay be called a for"' of combustio-n. This
creates a magnetic field around the object, a traction for it, a road
for it.
'Yes (in reply to a question) the thrust J'ltight be called external
in a way, beca~se the heated object ects as both a magnet and a repeller.
It· is extre~ely difficult to put into words. Yes, there is a heat wave
which passes over the entire exterior of the disc. Have you noticed the
glow around some of these objects? Some of them reach what you call whi-.s
heat. T-
his is heated and cooled at a·n extremely high rate of speed. \'le
need the quantum theor.y to explain this. No, the heat wave d-
oes not af-
fect the interior of the Disc nor t~e people. in it. Yes, you can call it
a pick-up-and lay-down motion ~ with the expansion and cont~action at quaD-,
tum rates.
'Yes, I think such a Method of propulsion could be used here, but
the cost would be too high -- to produce tha t kind of heat and that kind
f)f n1aterial, which wou·ld have to be exceedingly tenuous. No, I do not
know of any such substa~ce (on earth) at present. Yes, it would be a
synthetic material. I think the most profitable line of inquiry for·
physicists would be to try to understand what the etheric is, apart from
the gases. That would be the first approach -- to try to understand this
unseeable space around you. Also, to understand molecular Aotion. Yes,
molecular motion applies to the ether. No, I do not know of any such
thing as a substance which is not particulate -- which is ho~ogeneous.~

CHEMICAL MATTER AND ETH-ERIC 'fATTER .
'
The following coJ'!Uilent is by Associate Millen Cook, now }frs. Brinaley
le Poer Trench of London, England. She has been a contributor to ~aga­
zines of national circulation, has been a life-long stude~t of the sci-
ences and of esoteric philosophy, and has ~ade valuable cont~ibutions-
in the field of borderland investigation and research•
. , "Chemical matter, the 1'1\atter of o·ur plane ·of dally life, is_
· a llll\1t-
ed product of what is called the third transformation,· and is produced
by the combination of astral atoms. There is only so much of it in ex-
istence and there is an end to it somewhere. It was a deliberate crea-
tion by ~en~ient beings, and as such will eventually. disintegrate vhen
the supporting energies have run out. But there is · a lot of it in exis-
tence, it ·has spread itself over a lot of territory, and each atom occu-
pies a lot of -space without actually filling that apace• . It is both
heavy and complicated without being dense. Compared to ot·her kinds of
atoms it is a large, ~oorn, open-work affair, which like the ' solar system
includes Jl'lUch space in its periphery. Also, like the solar system, its
component parts are complicated and composed of a great n~ber of funda-
mental units of primal-state matter. But the cheJI'lical atoms we know are
aimple structures coMpared to large scale primitive ato~s of which they
~re the di·sintegration products.
. .
11The catch is, that you cant get a chemical atom off by itself and
the other kinds of matter existing in the area it o~cupies account for
so many more fundamental matter-units than the cheMical atom contains,
th&t the space any given chemical atom occupies outweighs it times over
from the point o£ view of a universal observer. But human beings observe
only the che~cal atoms directly. Che~ical ~atter tends to be pushed to-
gether in eddies or vortices, and we tend to get an upside-down idea of
w

''There is lit·tle difference from the hu111an point of view between

than the .preceding one. Chemical Matter is .thus the most complicated,
the moat spread-out, and therefore the least dense ot all kinds. No

"The .ideaof the origin of the Discs on Venus may be pure aasul'llp-
tion, but I cannot be so utterly scienti£ic as to disregard it on that
account. Within the ra~ifieations of the theory I play with, they could
be both e~heric and Venusian, since in ~hat theory · Venus supports ·an
etheric civilization that was once (and may ·be again) in contact and
CO~UDioatiOD with the CheMical civilization of thia .planet& And if
we assume they are Venusians, the stature question would solve. itself
with a much decreased shrinkage factor for col'lplete materialization.

r·H~ FLYING SAUCERS OF OAHSPE . .·
. .
Students of the ·curioQS book called Oahspe will
number of references to flying craft of ~any kinds.
Chief of the Essenes of Cos~on, writes:
recall a great
Mr, Wing Anderson,
"Flying Saucers, Discs, Etherean .vessels, At~ospherean firesbipa --
Oahspe is loaded with the~Z The references I enclose are only a tew
ot theM, since many ships referred to in the text. are not listed in
the index. In one place a jet propulsion ship is described. It is my
opinion that flying discs are not etherean in the Oahspean sense of the
word, but rather 'at~ospherean', and that their propulsion is probably
from utilization of Vortexia, a primary energy. But the relation of
these Oahspean vessels to the various craft ·now being seen in our own
skies should be care·fully studied. • • "
~fr, Anderson supplies the following page and ver.ae refere~ces:

Accounts of Ether Ships carrying . ~illions of hu~an spirits and Gods
are, of course~ utterly fantastic at first glance. But, as we have point-
ed out.
, there i~ practieally nothing else in the oMniverse but £.2.2m, 1. e.~
Space not occupied by visible Matter; moreover, we are here dealing with
concepts quite outside our ordinary space-time world. The "at~ospheria~
of Oahspe is spheres or plateaux f~Urrounding the whole earth, "Etheria"
is the e~ancipated heavens beyond Chinvat, the bridge or boundary of
the earth's vortex, beyond the orbit of the ~foon. '

Oahspe was mechanically written through the hand of a New York
dentist, Dr. J. B. Newbrough.;. 1st edition, 1882; one of the most extra-
ordinary works ever produced, about a thousand page~~ The "Book ·of Cos-
mogony and Prophecy", on~ of the 35 books Making up .Oahspe, is packed
with an extraordinary kind of super. science which is iPipressive and
p.owerful, whatever one's belief in such ~atters l"ay b.e.

AND IN CONCLUSION
Every fact and object and event which enters our experience belongs
equally to science, philosophy and religion, unless by narrow definitions
we exclude them. An electron, a star, a puls~ beat 'or a thought are .
all and each prop~r subjects for scientific analysis; each present• ~.
moat prof'oun'd probleJ~ts of metaphysics; and each may well awaken the iPt•
pulses of awe and worship when the sense of its pystery grows strong
upon us. This is true even of dreaMs ~d delusions and errora: for
these too are factual things, forMs o~ experience, existents in th•ir
own way and right, If you add a colu~n of figures and add it wrongly,
the Mistake is as "'uch a fact and as much a J".ystery aa the correct re-
sult would be. No explanation is ever complete and final; all pheno•
mena of our plane belong to the borderland; and all are deep-rooted. in
the vast sea of cosmic life and energy of which we knov so lit~le·.
At times the borderland character of certain happenings becomes
obtrusive, co~pelling and important to , the whole of hul'lani~y. This ia
eJ~tinently the caa·e witb the phenoJI'\ena of the Flying Saucers (Ether Shipe)
. The data about the"' are factual and eJI'\piricalf ·but the science ot our
day re!'lains, up to the ·present at least (1950}., quite helpless in deal-
ing vi th them. nen . of scientific reputatio·n have remained cautiously
silent, or in so~e instances have joined or led the popular chorus ot
derision ~nd incredulity. For the press, the radio, the screen, and
the man in the street the vhole affair has been at once a huge joke and
a huge folly. No More bitter comMentary on the state of our conte~porary
culture could be iMagined. And yet fro~ the first there have been a
few who accepted the facts without question and who Understood in aope
degree their pro~ound significance.
But when we say that the science of our day is helpless in the
face of· this· proble111, we do not iMpugn the science of tomorrow ·-- that
is,· of the years to come. This science of tol'!orrow is now called
occult .and esote·ric, and these words in turn connot~ delusion, super-
stition, and decei't. So i~ has been in the past, an.d so it ·l'IUSt contin-
ue to be, through a shortening future. One could fill a book, quite
easily, with ideas, concepts, predictions of an occult order, regarded
conte~ptuously in their time, yet later accepted, restated, verified,
integrated in one for"' or another with acceptable· scientific thinking.
The occultis~ of today is the science of tomorrow. This thought is
hateful to some, but it is a true thought and ~istory bears witness to
it. It i .s to the occult scientist or the scientifically trained occul-
tis·t that the future of our culture belongs -- if by chance it surviv.ea
what see~s to be its impending debacle. ·.:·~··:.:· \
The Ether Craft (Flying Saucers), the Et~rians, and the Etheric
Worlds exist, and man has always had some knowledge of them. Occultiate
and Adepts have always known ·about theM. Mode~n science has seen no
occasion either to accept or reject. Etheri~ pheno~ena, like those
called psychic and spiritistic, have been outlawed .as sporadic and with-
out significance. Isut little by little these latter two have gain~d

inte.llectuals· have never. ·learned, perhaps never will learn. But Most
ot us,· fo~ all that," would like to learn a little so..,_
ething froM aoflle
aource'"a.bout the.:~e strange distu~bing viaitor.s, and · we aak cur eci~n­
tista and i~t~llectuals and get no answer at all. But since we have
said that all ..plienortena ·are borderland 'in l ·ast ·analysis; and that occul-
tism ~as for~run 3cience rtany times, and is itself the science of the
future-, let us at least inq~ire of this source. Let us ask, and hear
vhat the occultist· has to say -- since there is no one else to listen
to ---and then if it seeMs even worse· than tqe Maundering& of o~her
alleged authorities, we can put it easily aside. \'/hat does occult in-
vestigation reveal, and what does occult authority .reveal if we consult
it as a laet 4eaperate reaolrce?
. .
In the t~rst place, the oc~ultist confirl'1s a number of atate~enta
· already made in this bo<!klet, · a:nd elabor.atea theJ!t, and adds others.
the et~.er .. ships (Flying Sauc'ers), the Etheri.ans·, and Etheria are real,
though thei.r . existence for the 7'\.
ost part is out~ide our range of sense
perc~ption. _ Ou~ earth, al1 planets, all stars, all heavenly bodies,
even· all terrestial obj_
ects have etheric dupli.cates. ·
The celestial bodies have· aleo their etheric spheres probably con-
centric with the visible body but extending far beyond it. These . .
aphe~e:s, inst·ead of being separated by astronol"'ical distances, actually
interpenetrate. To pass fro" one to another does not ~ean to traverse
dist~nce, but only to change a vibratory rate or ~ condition of con-
sc:i.ousneas. The clairvoyant who has etheric vision doell not go ·. anywhere,
he simply ~egins to see w~at is invisible · to lltOSt o.t ua. These eth_eric
~rlda have their inhabitants, each according to its kind -- and t~e
number of such worlds is perhaps. as infinite as the nuMber of the inter-
penetrating ethers themaelves.
ETHERiC MATTER RESPOiiDS TO THOUGHT
..
It is in those etheric worlds that the Ether Ships of all forM&
originate. Etheric rtatter ·is responsive to thougb~~energy. Any object
can be created by thought, v.i.
ll.- and imagination; and it d.oea not lack
reality tor that reason. Ether- craft are JY\ade· in this Y&)" in the earth'•
etberic, in the· etberic of Venus and Hars, very likely in other regiona
also~ That does not mean that they are made on the !!!ible planets.
These craft can be,. are, and always have been used tor interplanetary
flight. It· is said that they penetrate the galaxies ·of the Milky Way.
And the craft best known to us, the Discs or Flying Saucers, originate
in the Etheric of Venus and their form imitates the disc-like appearance
of that planet.
This assertion about interplanetary travel raises, for us, the pro-
blem' of enormous distances and the time required to traverse them, even
- 38 -
,-
~ at speed exceeding that of light. From the occult point of view, how•
ever~ this proble~ hardly exists. These craft are material in our sense
ot -the word, when in regions adjac·ent to our earth, They are alwa7a
material when the word matter is used in ita most extended sense; tor
even ·the finest ethers are still partieularate, and .may be . properl7
called material, though possessing properties unknown to . the rarefied
~atter of o~ own plane. We Q&n probably say,· that during transit their
materiality is that of a . thought-fo~ •

Let ·us ·look at this 1'\&tter froJ'Il another angle, even though tbe ..al-
_leged facta· will be unacceptable to many readers. Re"eMber, ve are
onl7 trying to fin~ out what a student of occult ~atters ~ight say if
ve could get hi"' to talk down to us. \·le are all Making thought-forJI\&
at ever7 J'llOment; clairvoyants can often see then and it ia easy to ia-
preaa them on photographi·c plates. Als-o, we can ~end these for!'\& to
any place we may desire, ~rrespective of tiJ'Ile and . dlatance• .It takes
no longer to think about the star Arcturus than about your finger-tip.
If you think an image of yourself, you can place it at the North Pole
as quickly as into the next roo~. ~either . the time nor 'the distance
enter into the operation at all.
. Let us recall a ·short and profound saying; You are ~here your con-
scio·usness is. For it not -- where else? Put ALL your consciousness·
into the next room and where are you? If you can find an answer which
deatroyatthis apho~ism, you can uproot all the occult philosophies in
the world at the same time.
Now the skilled occultist, the Adept if you like, ~akes a thought-
for~ of himself, or projects his consciousness which ta~es on a ~or~;
and ~his forM may be and often is visible and tangible at some .distant
place. He can also make a thought-form of a dog or a voLt ·(for exa~ple)
,ud under apecial conditions this also May be seen and beard and touched.
By this line of reasoning (and of facts) he can Make an object . (aay a
Flying Disc) out of mental ~atter, ~ind-stuff, and under right conditions
it too M&Y be seeable ~nd touchable at whatever place he desires. · Thia
is not teleportation of an object. His thought materiali~cs in mental
matter, then subsequently in etheric Matter, finally in matter as ia
known to ·our senses -- if the oper4tion is carried that far.
In a sense, a Flying Saucer or any. object ~ade in this way is aliYe.
It ia in-formed by the ~nd-life of its maker, It is a kind of extension
of the parent mind, just as .every thought is, in some way and ·degree.
The destruction of such ·a form is only like the cessation or withdrawal
of a thought or effort of the w.ill. ·
Innumerable questions of _course occur to one. If these Discs are,
in their 'inception, creations. of thought, we can see how an experimenter
·on, say, Arcturus, can place his Mind-created Disc 33 light years away,
in the earth's etheric, just as easily and quickly as anywhere else• .
But then, apparently, once i ·nside the earth's atmosphere this l!iaterial-
ised craft begin~ to employ Means of propulsion; and if it chances t~
come to a forc~landing (?)we find it has an extremely hard metallic
shell. Further, there are those little people whose bodies are found
inside. ·

cause of the liAits of_sen_

REHDIHC THE VEIL
The question ia ·otten asked: if the Etherians visit us mainly to
gain inforAation about conditions here, and for their own historical
archivea, why go to th_
e troubl.e of ether craft construc~ion? Wh~ not
obtain all such infcr~ation by projection· of consciousness. in one Mode
or another? An answer appear~ to be, that they are intenaelt desirous
of awakening earth people to an awarene-ss of other foras ·and regions of
life than our O'WD ~- for OUr ·ollll sake and for theirS also •.·
It ia the opinion of the present writer, that our prea~nt civilisa-
tion and culture have- reached an impasse, for which there is NO solution
in the normal course of events. And whether we make H-Bomba or leave
the ~a~ing to our enemies, we shall come. to the aa~e · destruction from
them. The real problem -is the underlying selfishness and fear, and
these arQ incurable by any Aeans whic~ we can and w.ill use. But it
is possible, ·even pr~bable6 that great events, either of a supernormal
order, or gr~at cataclysms of Nature, AaY so stun and dolltinate the lltinda
of men, that they w.ill ~urn aside from old thoughts and ~onsider ways or
bro~herhood and mutual -understanding. I~ is probable ttiat this thought
is in the ·minds of .our .Etherian brothers also, and that as a last re-
sort they may intervene, with all impartiality, in our tangled atfaira.
