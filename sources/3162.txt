PREFACE
It HAS BEEN THE privilege of the author to rediscover,
demonstrate and verify a chain of facts of priceless value
to human life.
It is a great privilege and no less a profound duty to
make these experiences available to mankind, as a dis-
charge of personal responsibility.
For over half a century, the writer has daily enjoyed the
benefits derived from the discovery and verification of a
Plan and Method as to how dis-ease may be removed from
the physical body and how Health, Harmony and Happiness
may be established and maintained by an exact, scientific
plan and procedure, which, when once understood, is within
the reach of every human being who may be desirous of
demonstrating its value for himself. And this is true re-
gardless of his or her financial status.
It is the desire to share these experiences that has in-
spired the writer in this humble effort to record them for
what value they may have, to all who may become inspired
to try them out by a personal application and verify their
truth or inaccuracy.
In addition to the investigations, experiences and studies
of the author, he has been granted the privilege to freely
draw upon and quote from the vast storehouse of the dem-
onstrated facts of Natural Science that has accumulated
throughout the ages and has been organized, systematized
and classified and made available to the general public by
The School of Natural Science, in the form of text books
obtainable in the major libraries of our Nation. The titles
of the text books and supplementary publications that the
author has freely drawn upon and quoted from will be found
listed in a later chapter.
The term Natural Science will be used herein when re-
ferring to all the various branches of science as a unit
:
physical, spiritual, mental, moral and psychological.
VII
The contents of this book are presented strictly upon
their merits. The Truth is intrinsic within itself. Their
truth must be self-evident and of primary importance. The
question of who discovers facts and truth should be second-
ary.
To re-discover them for ourselves is of major importance
and value, and if and when the true value is discovered,
verified and found of service, that it shall become universal-
ly available.
It is because of their simplicity and the universality of
their nature that they are usually overlooked, just as we are
rarely conscious of the air we breathe and without which
we could not long survive.
With these elucidations, the author hopes and trusts that
the reader will permit the writer's personality remaining
unobtrusively in the background, so as to avoid unnecessary
public attention and conserve time and energy for possible
future need. There is no desire in any way to evade nor
avoid responsibility for any statement made or to be made
in the future.
The writer neither seeks nor desires benefits nor favors,
in any form or manner, insofar as he personally is con-
cerned. Abundant compensation has daily been received
from Nature during the course of a long and active life of
experimentation and demonstration, as proof and verifica-
tion of the accuracy in practice of the laws and principles
that govern human health and happiness.
Anyone desiring to communicate with the writer, rela-
tive to the subject matter presented, may address his com-
munication to Student of Life, Box No. 515, Sun Valley,
Calif., and the writer will gladly supplement or elucidate,
as the need may require and the limitations of the author
will permit.
Personal contact may be had, if and when the need
develops.
Sincerely,
STUDENT OF LIFE.

IX
THIS IS A STUDY and SEARCH
FOR KNOWLEDGE OF HEALTH
AND
THE CAUSES OF
DISEASE.
There is a MORAL LAW in Nature,
That GOVERNS HUMAN LIFE.
NATURE'S MORAL LAW IS
THE ESTABLISHED HARMONIC
RELATION WHICH MAN AS AN
INDIVIDUAL-INTELLIGENCE
SUSTAINS TO THE
CONSTRUCTIVE PRINCIPLE
IN INDIVIDUAL LIFE.
THERE IS A
CONSTRUCTIVE PRINCIPLE
IN
INDIVIDUAL LIFE
AND
A
DESTRUCTIVE PRINCIPLE
IN
INDIVIDUAL LIFE.
XI
THE CONSTRUCTIVE PRINCIPLE
IN INDIVIDUAL LIFE.
That GREAT FUNDAMENTAL LAW OR
PRINCIPLE of Nature back of the processes
which integrates inorganic matter, organizes vege-
table and animal matter into living organic bodies,
renews and sustains Individual Life, and consti-
tutes the essential foundation of all development
and growth, physical, spiritual, mental, moral, and
psychological.
THE DESTRUCTIVE PRINCIPLE
IN INDIVIDUAL LIFE.
That which DISINTEGRATES, TEARS DOWN,
OR DESTROYS any of Nature's CONSTRUC-
TIVE INDIVIDUALITIES, whether they be
physical, spiritual, mental, moral or psychical, has
been designated as the DESTRUCTIVE PRIN-
CIPLE IN INDIVIDUAL LIFE.
THESE ARE NATURE'S STANDARDS
FOR
EVOLUTION OR DEVOLUTION
XII
MAN'S THOUGHTS and ACTIONS
THAT ARE IN HARMONY
WITH THE MORAL LAW
OR
THE CONSTRUCTIVE PRINCIPLE
IN INDIVIDUAL LIFE
GENERATE HEALTH.
MAN'S THOUGHTS and ACTIONS
THAT DISREGARD OR VIOLATE
THE CONSTRUCTIVE PRINCIPLE
IN INDIVIDUAL LIFE
PRODUCE DISEASE.
MAN
IS A MORAL BEING
WHICH MEANS
NATURE'S MORAL LAW
GOVERNS
MAN'S THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS.
THEREFORE
MAN IS MORALLY RESPONSIBLE
AND PERSONALLY ACCOUNTABLE
FOR HIS THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS.
XIII
WHY
MAN IS MORALLY RESPONSIBLE AND
PERSONALLY ACCOUNTABLE
FOR HIS THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS.
EVOLUTION HAS ENDOWED MAN WITH
CERTAIN FACULTIES, CAPACITIES, and
POWERS. They are as follows:
SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS.
THE POWER TO REASON.
THE POWER TO THINK.
A FREE, INDEPENDENT, RATIONAL
CHOICE.
AN INDEPENDENT, SELF-CONSCIOUS, RA-
TIONAL FREEDOM OF WILL.
The possession of these FACULTIES, capacities
and POWERS enables Man TO LEARN and TO
KNOW RIGHT from WRONG.
To make an Intelligent Choice, with the Power to
Execute that Choice, through INDEPENDENT
RATIONAL VOLITION .
MAN possesses these Faculties, Capacities and
Powers; Nature, therefore holds him MORALLY
RESPONSIBLE and PERSONALLY AC-
COUNTABLE FOR HIS THOUGHTS and AC-
TIONS, To the degree of his Knowledge at any
given time.
XIV
EVOLUTION
EVOLUTION represents,
NATURE'S PLAN and PROCESS
OF INDIVIDUALIZING
INTELLIGENCE.
EVOLUTION involves the refinement of matter,
The increase of vibratory activity,
The generation of life,
The Individualization of Intelligence,
The development of Love,
And the attainment of HAPPINESS.
All rounds of physical organisms, are but Nature's
DEVICES for the developing and individualizing
of Intelligence, that is, all rounds of animal organ-
isms, from the lowest to the highest, are but Na-
ture's Mechanical Devices, for the evolutionary un-
foldment of Individual Intelligence.
xv
NATURAL LAW
FURNISHES MAN WITH THE SOLUTION
TO
HEALTH and DISEASE.
NATURAL SCIENCE and HUMAN
EXPERIENCE
FURNISHES THE ANSWER.
It is
MORALITY and IMMORALITY
CONSTRUCTION and DESTRUCTION
RIGHT and WRONG.
That which is CONSTRUCTIVE in Human Life
is MORAL.
THAT which is DESTRUCTIVE in Human Life
is IMMORAL.
THAT which is MORAL in Human Life is
RIGHT.
THAT which is IMMORAL in Human Life is
WRONG.
XVI
HEALTH
IS THE NATURAL, NORMAL and
HARMONIOUS
STATE OR RELATION
OF
BODY AND MIND,
IN WHICH ALL FUNCTIONS PROCEED
WITHOUT ANY DISTURBANCE, AND
RESULT IN BODILY EASE AND MENTAL
SERENITY.
HEALTH
IS CONTINUOUS HARMONIOUS CHANGE.
HEALTH
IS SATISFIED POLARITY.
THE BALANCING OF THE POSITIVE and
RECEPTIVE ELEMENTS.
HARMONIOUS VIBRATION.
XVII
HARMONY and DISCORD
SCIENTIFICALLY SPEAKING, HARMONY
IS MATHEMATICAL PROPORTION.
GENERALLY SPEAKING, HARMONY IS A
THING IN ITS TIME AND PLACE.
DISCORD IS A THING OUT OF TIME OR
OUT OF PLACE OR BOTH.
HARMONY GENERATES HEALTH.
DISCORD DEVELOPS DISEASE.
DISEASE can be TRANSMUTED INTO
HEALTH, JUST AS MOST OF US DEMON-
STRATE HEALTH CAN BE TRANSMUTED
INTO DISEASE.
XVIII
EVOLUTION
OF
HUMAN CHARACTER
SELFISHNESS IS THE ATTITUDE OF IN-
TELLIGENCE that DESIRES to RECEIVE
MORE FREELY, THAN ITS WILLINGNESS
TO GIVE.
JUSTICE is the DESIRE TO RENDER AN
EQUIVALENT FOR EVERY SERVICE RE-
CEIVED.
GENEROSITY or ALTRUISM is the ATTI-
TUDE or DESIRE to RENDER CONSTRUC-
TIVE SERVICE to one's FeUowmen, without the
motive or desire for selfish gain or benefit.
This is Nature's YARDSTICK FOR MEASUR-
ING HUMAN EVOLUTION.
XIX
CONSCIOUSNESS
CONSCIOUSNESS is the FACULTY or CAPA-
CITY of the Individual Intelligence, by and
through which it becomes aware of the existence
of a world outside itself, as well as a world of de-
mands within.
SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS IS THAT CHARAC-
TER, DEGREE OR QUALITY OF Conscious-
ness which enables us to know and understand
ourselves. It is that which enables us to perform
acts knowingly and intentionally.
It involves the consciousness of the relations which
exist between this self and other selves.
It is that Consciousness which is able to recognize
the Self as a Responsible Individual Intelligence.
MEMORY is the RECORDED HISTORY of the
COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE of the Individual
Intelligence.
RECOLLECTION is the ability of the Intelli-
gence to bring a sub-conscious record into immedi-
ate consciousness.
XX
INTELLIGENCE
INTELLIGENCE is the CREATIVE and GOV-
ERNING PRINCIPLE AND POWER OF LIFE.
PRINCIPLE, as herein used, meaning PLAN of
ACTION.
POWER, the method or means of EXECUTING
PLAN.
LA W, the Harmonious function according to plan.
INTELLIGENCE expresses itself as UNIVER-
SAL and INDIVIDUAL.
UNIVERSAL Intelligence creates, governs and is
back of UNIVERSAL NATURE.
INDIVIDUAL Intelligence expresses itself
through and is back of its Individual forms of
bodies.
INTELLIGENCE is POSITIVE, that is, AC-
TIVE.
MATTER is NEGATIVE, that which is acted
upon.
An Intelligent Individual is the FIRST OBJECT
in Nature and has a life, a plan, a purpose and a
destiny distinctly his own.
These are accounted as individual to himself as are
his face and his form, his habits and tastes, his
physical and spiritual bodies, his intellectual am-
bitions and moral aspirations.
MAN COMES TO BE WHAT HE IS, BY THE
STRUGGLES IN WHICH HIS OWN INTELLI-
GENCE IS FOREVER ENGAGED.
XXI
WILL POWER
WILL is the MOTIVE POWER which sets in
motion all the voluntary processes of Individual
Being, in all its various departments.
WILL IS THE SUM OF ALL INDIVIDUAL
ENERGIES, and the power by which man is en-
abled to focalize his energies upon a given point.
IT IS THE POLARIZATION OF THE ENTIRE
BEING.
WILL POWER proceeds outwards from the Indi-
vidual Intelligence as a center, and is a process of
GIVING, the opposite of RECEIVING.
CONSCIOUSNESS is the receiving CAPACITY
of the Intelligence.
An Independent, Self-Conscious and Rational Act
is NEVER performed without an impulse of the
Will to SET IN MOTION the process, by and
through which the act is to be accomplished.
This Impulse of the WILL is called VOLITION.
XXII
VIBRATION
All Natural Phenomena express themselves
through movement.
Every action has its equal and opposite reaction.
This movement is named vibration.
The degree of speed of vibration is infinite in varia-
tion.
The states or condition of matter, whether it is
called solid, liquid or gaseous is determined by the
degree of vibration.
CONSCIOUSNESS receives, measures and records
vibrations, and conveys the fact to the Individual
Intelligence for its guidance.
ALL PHENOMENA known to HUMAN INTEL-
LIGENCE speak through vibration.
THE SENSE ORGANS MEASURE AND
WEIGH DIFFERING DEGREES OF VIBRA-
TION AND CONVEY THE INFORMATION
TO CONSCIOUSNESS.

THE TRULY GREAT PHYSICIAN

A CURE DEPENDS UPON and is DETER-
MINED BY the INDIVIDUAL who is ILL.
The PERSON who is ILL, has CAUSED that
ILLNESS by THE DISREGARD OF or THE
VIOLATION OF the particular Natural Law or
Laws, that produced that particular illness.
Before a permanent CURE can take place, The
Individual involved MUST FIRST REMOVE
ITS CAUSE.

CHAPTER I
A Study & Analysis of
Health
Individually & Collectively
JUST WHAT DOES the concept of HEALTH signify?
How may it be acquired and maintained?
To understand the meaning of what constitutes health
in the Human Being, it is necessary to make a careful
study of Man, himself, whose thoughts and actions DETER-
MINE and are responsible for the existence of HEALTH
or ITS ABSENCE.
Man is an Intelligent Being.
As an Individualized UNIT of Intelligence, he possesses,
occupies and uses a material instrument he names his
Physical Body.
It is through the use of his physical body, that he acquires
a knowledge and experience of physical phenomena upon
this physical plane of life.
It is the Intelligence of Man, through personal experience
acquired through his physical body and the exercise of
reason and intuition, that he discovers the existence of
Nature's Laws and Man's relations to those Laws. It is the
Intelligence of Man, through personal experience, that
discovers the necessity to obey those Laws, if Man desires
to establish and maintain health and acquire Happiness
in his life.
His physical body is merely one of Nature's mechanical
27
HARMONIOUS LIVING
means, by and through which Nature grows and develops
his Intelligence and enables Man, himself, to continue his
own Intellectual Development, under Natural guidance.
It is the Intelligence of Man that is the Knower, the
Thinker, the Planner, the Actor, the Doer.
Intelligence as herein used, meaning the CREATIVE
AND GOVERNING PRINCIPLE AND POWER.
It expresses itself through Natural Law.
PRINCIPLE as herein used, meaning PLAN and PUR-
POSE.
POWER being the method or means of executing that
Plan.
LAW being the Harmonious function according to Plan.
INTELLIGENCE expresses itself as UNIVERSAL and
INDIVIDUAL.
UNIVERSAL INTELLIGENCE as the CREATIVE &
GOVERNING PRINCIPLE & POWER, BACK OF ALL
CREATION.
INDIVIDUAL INTELLIGENCE expresses itself through
and is back of its Individualized forms or bodies.
Man as an Individualized Intelligence has been endowed
by Universal Intelligence with the Capacities and Powers
of SELF-GOVERNMENT and SELF-DETERMINA-
TION.
The capacities and Powers that enable Man to govern
himself and determine his own DESTINY, are as follows:
(1) SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS.
(2) THE POWER TO REASON and THINK.
(3) The Ability to make an INDEPENDENT and
RATIONAL CHOICE.
(4) The Possession of a FREE, INDEPENDENT,
SELF-CONSCIOUS and RATIONAL POWER
of WILL.
28
A STUDY & ANALYSIS OF HEALTH
NATURAL SCIENCE describes and defines those Capa-
cities and Powers in the following terms:
(1) CONSCIOUSNESS is the Faculty or Capacity of the
Individual Intelligence by and through which it becomes
aware of the existence of a World outside itself, as well
as a World of demands within.
Through this Faculty or Capacity the appetites, passions,
emotions, impulses, desires, affections, instincts and intui-
tions make their impressions upon the Individual Intel-
ligence, and command recognition.
Through this Faculty or Capacity alone are the five phy-
sical senses able to convey their messages to the Individual
Intelligence and have them recorded. This constitutes
Simple Consciousness.
SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS is that character, degree or
quality of Consciousness which enables us to know and
understand ourselves.
It is that which enables us to perform our acts knowingly
and intentionally.
It involves the Consciousness of the relations which exists
between this Self and those other Selves.
It is that Consciousness which is able to recognize the Self
as a Responsible Individual Intelligence.
It is indeed one of the principal, fundamental and essential
elements of Human Character, upon which Individual Res-
ponsibility is based and upon which it depends.
(2) REASON. Man reasons analytically, synthetically,
inductively, and deductively, on all the affairs of his own
life, as well as the lives of his fellow man. He reasons upon
his physical body, his appetites, passions, impulses, desires
and functions.
He reasons upon this Life and the Life to come. He reasons
upon the spirit and likewise upon the Soul. He reasons upon
what he is and what he yet may become. He reasons upon
29
HARMONIOUS LIVING
himself, as an Individual Intelligence, and as a part of the
great aggregate of UNIVERSAL INTELLIGENCE. He
reasons upon things finite and things which appear to him
to be Infinite. He reasons upon God and Nature, Finite
Intelligence and Infinite Intelligence. He reasons upon
reason itself.
It is upon this power of reason that he depends, to guard
himself from the errors, mistakes and accidents of Life. It
is this power that enables him to anticipate the Natural
and Logical results of his own actions. Reason is one of the
essential and fundamental elements of Human Character
at the basis of Individual Responsibility.
THINKING is that process of the Individual Intelligence,
which sets in motion and controls the activities of all the
faculties, capacities and powers.
THINKING involves the voluntary exercise of all the
Faculties, Capacities and Powers of the Individual Intelli-
gence doing the thinking, which requires the attention upon
the subject of thought, to the exclusion of everything else.
One who is actively thinking, is using his own Intelligent
Faculties, Capacities and Powers so intently as to close his
Consciousness to impressions from other sources.
(3) FREEDOM OF CHOICE.
Man has the ability to make an independent and rational
choice or selection. However much we may endeavor to
excuse ourselves from the Natural penalties of our mis-
takes or transgressions, upon the theory that we are but
creatures of circumstances, we know that our fellowman,
almost unanimously, deals with us upon the assumption
that we do possess the power of Independent Choice, nor
do we even protest against such an assumption, on the con-
trary, we encourage it.
Our Pride of Intelligence would be most deeply offended,
if our friends and fellows should presume to doubt or
question our perfect Independence.
30
A STUDY & ANALYSIS OF HEALTH
(4) INDEPENDENT, SELF-CONSCIOUS and RA-
TIONAL VOLITION.
An independent, self-conscious, and rational act is NEVER
PERFORMED WITHOUT an impulse of the Will to set
in motion the process, by and through which the act is to
be accomplished.
This impulse of the Will we call VOLITION.
Man in his normal physical and mental state of being,
possesses the power to act independently, this means that
he is able to act, unaided and uninfluenced by his fellow-
men.
He also possesses the power to act Self-consciously, this
means that he is able to act knowingly and intentionally.
This means that he is able to anticipate the Natural and
Logical results of his own acts, within the scope of his
acquired knowledge.
Thus it is found and universally admitted that the primary,
fundamental and essential elements of Individual Responsi-
bility are:
(1) SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS.
(2) REASON.
(3) INDEPENDENT CHOICE.
(4) INDEPENDENT, SELF-CONSCIOUS, and RA-
TIONAL VOLITION.
Upon the basis of these elements of Human Character and
by the standards which they establish, we judge our fellow-
men, whether we admit it or not, and upon the same basis
and by the same standards, we are judged by them, whether
we will it or not.
Man is a Moral Being, that is, Man is governed by Nature's
Law of Morality.
Man's thoughts and actions are subject to the operation of
the Moral Law.
NATURAL SCIENCE defines Morality as follows:
31
HARMONIOUS LIVING
Man's established Harmonic relation to the CONSTRUC-
TIVE PRINCIPLE OF HIS BEING.
The CONSTRUCTIVE PRINCIPLE in INDIVIDUAL
LIFE, is that great fundamental LAW or PRINCIPLE
in Nature, back of the processes which integrates inorganic
matter, organizes vegetable and animal matter, into living
organic bodies, renews and sustains individual life, and
constitutes the essential foundation for all development
and growth, Physical, Spiritual, Mental, Moral, and Psy-
chological.
The Natural Law of Morality holds Man Morally Respon-
sible and Personally Accountable for his thoughts and
actions.
HEALTH, therefore, represents Man's Harmonious adjust-
ment to the CONSTRUCTIVE PRINCIPLE of his BE-
ING.
Human thought and action that are in Harmony with the
Constructive-Principle in Individual Life are MORALLY
RIGHT.
Human thought and action that disregard or violate the
Constructive-Principle in Individual Life, knowingly and
intentionally, thereby subject the Individual to the opera-
tion of the DESTRUCTIVE PRINCIPLE in Individual
Life.
The DESTRUCTIVE PRINCIPLE in Individual Life is
defined by Natural Science as that which disintegrates,
tears down, or destroys any of Nature's CONSTRUCTIVE
INDIVIDUALITIES, WHETHER THEY BE Physical,
Spiritual, Mental, Moral or Psychical.
Human thought and action that correspond to the Destruc-
tive Principle in Individual Life are MORALLY
WRONG.
THEREFORE,
That which is CONSTRUCTIVE in Human Life is MOR-
ALLY RIGHT.
32
A STUDY & ANALYSIS OF HEALTH
That which is DESTRUCTIVE in Human Life is MOR-
ALLY WRONG.
MORALITY OR IMMORALITY, CONSTRUCTION OR
DESTRUCTION, constitute Nature's gravi-meter or stand-
ard of measurement for Human EVOLUTION or DE-
VOLUTION, Human GROWTH or DEGENERACY, Hu-
man Health or Dis-ease, Human Mortality or Immortality.
ETHICALLY considered there are but two fundamental
principles in Nature, in their relation to Individual Life.
The one is CONSTRUCTIVE or Normal and the other
DESTRUCTIVE or Abnormal.
Every fact of Nature, whether Scientific, Philosophic,
Religious or otherwise aligns itself as a direct result of
these two fundamental principles in operation.
The great problem in Individual Life is that of identifying
these two Principles in their relation to the objective facts
of Nature, so that we may be able to conform to the one
and avoid the other.
The application of this great Law to the ethics of Human
Life, constitutes the basis of all religious and philosophical
systems of the past as well as of the present.
The limitations of Human Intelligence, in its efforts to
grasp and comprehend this Law in its entirety and apply
it as a rule and guide of conduct in the daily lives of Men,
are responsible for all the sectarianism of both Religion and
Philosophy as well as all the variations in governmental
systems throughout all the Nations of Earth.
In its Constructive aspect, we recognize it as the Law of
Compensation or Compensatory Justice, in accordance with
the Harmonics of Evolution.
In its Destructive aspect, we recognize it as the Law of
Retribution or Retributive Justice, in accordance with the
Discords of Devolution.
To the Constructive side of this great Law of Justice, is
referable all that there is in Individual growth, develop-
33
HARMONIOUS LIVING
ment, progress, strength, health, energy, life, love and hap-
piness, both here and hereafter.
This is the domain of Nature's Compensatory Rewards to
Individual Intelligence for obedience to Nature's Evolu-
tionary Principle.
The Ultimate goal of Individual Achievement under and
in accordance with the operation of Nature's Constructive
Principle is so far as Science knov/s Individual Immortality
and perfect Happiness, in the fulfilling of the Law. THIS
IS THE WAY OF LIFE.
To the DESTRUCTIVE side of this great Law of Justice
is referable, all that there is in Individual ATROPHY,
WEAKNESS, ENERVATION, SICKNESS, SUFFER-
ING, SORROW, HATE, FEAR, DISEASE, DISSOLU-
TION, DISINTEGRATION, DECAY AND DEATH.
This indeed, is the domain of Nature's Retributive Punish-
ments to Individual Intelligence for disobedience of Na-
ture's evolutionary principle.
The Law itself is a Unit in Essence. It manifests itself
to Human Intelligence in its two-fold aspect, as one of the
most stupendous and comprehensive dualities of all Nature,
the duality of:
CONSTRUCTION & DESTRUCTION
MORALITY would seem to be the KEY to the great Uni-
versal search of all Human Kind for HEALTH, HAR-
MONY and HAPPINESS.
It therefore becomes Man's supreme task to acquire knowl-
edge and understanding of the full meaning, significance
and possibilities of the Moral Law in Nature. The Moral
Law in Nature, as it applies to Human Life, represents
Man's Harmonious Relation to the CONSTRUCTIVE
PRINCIPLE governing his life. In other words, Man
must learn how to think and act CONSTRUCTIVELY, if
he desires to build and maintain Health, Harmony and
Happiness.
34
A STUDY & ANALYSIS OF HEALTH
It is the Constructive Principle in Individual Life that
builds, grows and develops. It is the Destructive Principle
in Individual Life that disintegrates, tears down and des-
troys.
If we wish to build Health, Harmony and Happiness, we
must conform to the BUILDING PROCESS and avoid the
DESTRUCTIVE PROCESS.
So long as Man maintains a Harmonious Relation to the
Constructive Principle in Individual Life, it is impossible
for the Destructive Principle TO AFFECT HIM.
In so far as Man maintains that Harmonic Relation, every
other problem of his life will take care of itself, without
any special attention whatsoever upon his part.
By taking care of the central problem, The Harmonic
Relation, all the details of his life and relationships care
for themselves, as a perfectly Natural and inevitable result.
When Man devotes himself faithfully to maintaining the
Harmony of his relation to the Constructive Principle of
Nature, he may make some mistakes or some possible errors,
but he will never commit a sin.
Dis-ease represents Man's disregard of or the violation of
the Constructive Principle that governs his life, which sub-
jects him to the operation of the Destructive Principle in
Individual Life.
Nature's LAW of COMPENSATION IS THE EXPRES-
SION OF THE MORAL LAW in operation.
The Natural LAW of RETRIBUTION is a measure of
Man's disregard or violation of the MORAL LAW.
MORALITY or IMMORALITY, CONSTRUCTION or
DESTRUCTION are the forces that determine.
HEALTH or DISEASE
HEALTH is one of Nature's greatest blessings.
HEALTH is as Natural as breathing, under normal con-
ditions.
35
HARMONIOUS LIVING
That which is Constructive in Human Life is normal.
That which is Destructive in Human Life is abnormal.
WHY is HEALTH NOT UNIVERSAL in the Human
Family?
The answer now should become quite self-evident.
Man is a free-willed, self-conscious, rational, Intelligent
Being.
A Free-Willed, Self-Conscious, Rational Intelligence
means that the Intelligence possesses the ability to learn
and to know, that which is Morally Right and that which
is Morally Wrong.
The ability to make a free, independent and rational
CHOICE.
The power to execute that choice through the exercise of
the INDIVIDUAL POWER of WILL.
It is because Man possesses these Faculties, Capacities and
Powers that he is SUBJECT TO the operation of the
Moral Law, which means that Nature holds Man Morally
Responsible and Personally Accountable for his thoughts
and actions, to the degree of his knowledge, at any given
time.
Man may choose to Harmonize with Nature's Constructive
Laws that govern his Being, and THEREBY MAINTAIN
HIS HEALTH OR he may elect to disregard or violate
Natural Guidance (Her Constructive Laws) and thereby
produce DISCORD in his life, which if continued, per-
sisted in and maintained long enough, produces an accumu-
lation of impurities within the physical body that we name
DIS-EASE.
HEALTH, simply expressed, means Man's conformity to
Nature's CONSTRUCTIVE PRINCIPLE in INDIVIDU-
AL LIFE.
These facts should make it quite clear that if we desire to
establish and maintain Health and Harmony in our lives,
the very first step in that direction should be the acquisition
36
A STUDY & ANALYSIS OF HEALTH
of the knowledge of the Laws and Principles that govern
and determine HEALTH and HARMONY.
So that we may learn how we must live to fulfill the de-
mands of the Laws and Principles of Harmonious Living.
This is just as true in any Constructive endeavor that a
Human Being may undertake. To obtain exact and scien-
tific results, one must know the Laws governing the func-
tion of that particular endeavor and conform himself to
them.
As an Individual Intelligence, the business of Life and
Living becomes the acquisition of knowledge through per-
sonal experience that will enable him to fulfill the apparent
purpose of Life, the acquisition and maintenance of Health
and the attainment of Happiness.
Presuming that the Moral Laws of Nature govern Man's
thoughts and actions and that his thoughts and actions that
are in Harmony with the Moral Law are Constructive in
their effects, and that those thoughts and actions that dis-
regard or violate the Moral Law are destructive in their
results, then JUST HOW must we live or just precisely
how must Man conduct himself, so that he will fulfill the
requirements or the demands of the Moral Law?
What standard of measurement does Man possess or is he
capable of developing that can function as a yardstick,
compass or guide, by which he may govern his thoughts
and actions?
Let us see if we can find such a guide within Man himself
or within Natural Law or both.
Back of every fact in Nature, there is a Principle to which
that fact is related, and to which it must be referred for its
proper interpretation and meaning.
There is in Nature a BASIC and FUNDAMENTAL
PRINCIPLE, LAW and FUNCTION THAT underlies
every thought, every act, every movement, every process
and every function; it may be described as the activity of
37
HARMONIOUS LIVING
RECEIVING and GIVING.
(The Principle of vibration is an expression of receiving
and giving.)
All Human thought and action express themselves through
this Universal Process of Receiving and Giving.
If it were stated as a scientific fact that the whole of life's
activities consist basically and fundamentally of this pro-
cess of RECEIVING and GIVING, this statement could
withstand all scientific tests.
ESTABLISHING and MAINTAINING a balance between
this great and all-inclusive process, CONSTITUTES THE
SOLUTION to the GREAT UNIVERSAL SEARCH
FOR
HEALTH, HARMONY, and HAPPINESS.
The process of receiving and giving is a Universal Process
that applies to every plane of human activity, physical,
spiritual, mental, moral and physical.
Let us take a deep breath and behold this great sublime
fact. RECEIVING and GIVING. Could anything be
simpler? more comprehensive? all inclusive? or more self-
evident? after our attention has been centered upon the
sublime fact.
It is the very heart and soul of ETHICS, of RELIGION,
of PHILOSOPHY, of ORGANIZED SOCIETY, of
FRIENDSHIP, of LOVE, and of CO-OPERATION.
Marriage would lose all its meaning, without this vital and
fundamental activity.
Marriage cannot be very successful without a balancing or
equalizing of the attitude of love (giving and receiving)
towards each other.
It covers all of Nature's activities and functions; every
Law, every Principle is based upon the same function, Re-
ceiving and Giving.
It is doubtful if there is any function or process in Human
38
A STUDY & ANALYSIS OF HEALTH
Relations that cannot be measured and Harmoniously main-
tained by an equitable and just balancing of giving and
receiving.
At first glance, it does not seem possible that all the infinite
activities of life could be reduced to so simple and narrow
a function; that all the endless problems, difficulties, com-
plexities, anxieties, worries, fears, hopes, aspirations and
inspirations could possibly flow from so elemental and
simple a process; and yet, the science of mathematics is
based upon the duplication of the UNIT numerical symbol
1, and the language, history, and record of Human Experi-
ence is expressed, recorded and reproduced by the unit
symbols of our alphabet.
Through the Intelligent use of the numerical symbols, Man
is enabled to discover Nature's Laws and Principles.
By the aid of the alphabetical symbols, Man records and
reproduces those facts for the benefit of all mankind.
When we begin to study life's activities from this point of
view, living will lose its complexities, practically all its
difficulties, surely all its confusion, a large portion of its
mystery, and when we have learned to balance the scale
with life, we will have emerged from DARKNESS into the
BRIGHT SUNLIGHT.
To form a rational and scientific picture in our minds of
the significance of this fact and the justice involved, let us
digress for a few moments and investigate some untrodden
territory.
Let us project our imagination into the past and then ex-
tend it into the possible future. From the moment we are
born into this physical body until Nature's Laws says it's
time to depart, we take from life a large variety of services
of various kinds and degrees.
It is quite evident that in order to be just, we should, dur-
ing some part of our maturity, return to life a just equiv-
alent, for whatever services we have taken or received.
39
HARMONIOUS LIVING
It is also quite self-evident that the more we take, the more
we are obligated to return.
Under the Law of Equity, Justice and Right, we have a
Moral Right to take as much from life, as we stand ready
and willing to render an equivalent for.
We might further remember that our NEEDS are few.
Our wants may be many, and honesty says we are entitled
to whatever we are WILLING TO PAY FOR.
CHEATING generates disease, as surely as the Sun rises
in the morning and sets in the evening, to our vision. We
violate many Laws that we do not immediately feel the
results of, but there is no escape from Nature's Court of
Justice.
Let us return to our customary path and to the bright sun-
light, and when we enter into its territory INTELLECTU-
ALLY, the functions of DARKNESS will have become
impossible. Disease will have melted away, just as a cake
of ice melts in the sun and gives us good H20.
War will have become outmoded, just as cave dwelling has
ceased to be the custom. There will be no need or desire
for it.
FEAR, by the LIGHT of KNOWLEDGE, will have been
superseded by FAITH (Fear comes from lack of knowl-
edge).
ABUNDANCE will have been accomplished by the absorp-
tion of added Universal Knowledge (not previously avail-
able) and the development of EFFICIENCY and the RE-
MOVAL of WASTE.
Co-operation, Friendship and LOVE will then become the
normal WAY of LIFE.
Does this sound like a pipe dream from the day dreams of
a VISIONARY?
THINK IT OVER!
Is there anything DIFFICULT regarding the idea?
Does it require a great lawyer to comprehend the process?
40
A STUDY & ANALYSIS OF HEALTH
Does it require anything, that any normal human being on
earth is incapable of doing (except an infant)?
What is to prevent any normal human being, at any time
or place, from LIVING a JUST, EQUITABLE, and
RIGHTEOUS life?
What stands in the way of any normal human being or
collection of human beings building a Heaven on Earth for
himself or themselves?
Does it require anything that any human being DOES
NOT POSSESS?
Is there any human being that can NOT GIVE, which
entitles him to RECEIVE?
Could anything be SIMPLER? Could anything be
EASIER?
Could anyone invent or discover any function or process in
life, that every human is capable of carrying out, that
would produce such marvelous and unbelievable RE-
SULTS, as the SIMPLE PROCESS of giving an equivalent
for everything we receive?
That is what spells EQUITY, JUSTICE & RIGHT.
And that is what it takes to bring to each and every human
being, WHO PRACTICES IT,
HEALTH HARMONY HAPPINESS PEACE
AND PROSPERITY.
IT IS SIMPLE AND EASY FOR ANYONE, ANY TIME,
ANY PLACE, to try it out and prove it for himself.
Whether this is an idle dream, AN IMPRACTICAL
VISION, OR A DEMONSTRABLE PRACTICALITY
WITHIN THE REACH OF EVERY HUMAN BEING.
It does not require a laboratory, text books or laboratory
equipment.
ALL THAT IS NEEDED, is THE WILL TO DO.
41
HARMONIOUS LIVING
Nature does not FAIL, SHE PAYS IN FULL, to every
Human Being, For Every CONSTRUCTIVE EFFORT.
TRY IT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.
42
CHAPTER 2
Human Character
And Its Relation To
Receiving & Giving
JtlOW MAN ADJUSTS himself to this Universal Func-
tion of Life, CONSTITUTES HIS CHARACTER AT
ANY GIVEN TIME, and denotes his growth and develop-
ment, upon the steps of Evolution.
The growth and development of Human Character, natural-
ly evolves through three major classifications or stages,
and they are :
(1) SELFISHNESS.
(2) EQUITY, JUSTICE and RIGHT.
(3) GENEROSITY OR ALTRUISM.
(1) The first, or elementary, stage is represented by a lack
of knowledge, experience and understanding, as a result
of which, Man is influenced by a motive of Self-Preserva-
tion. Without a knowledge of the Law of Compensation
in Nature and with the need to survive, Man puts forth all
his efforts for Self-Preservation, regardless of the rights,
interests or welfare of others.
This Mental Attitude we name SELFISHNESS.
This state of mind influences the Intelligence to receive
all it can and give as little as it must.
(2) Equity, Justice and Right .
When, through the processes of time and Evolution, the
second stage of growth and development of the understand-
43
HARMONIOUS LIVING
ing is attained, the Intelligence has acquired a sufficient
degree of experience, knowledge and understanding of the
dual Law of Compensation and Retribution, so that HE
WILLINGLY AND GLADLY has adopted the desire and
motive to render a full and equivalent service, for each and
every service received.
This growth and development of Character and Intelligence
is defined as the normal sense of Equity, Justice and Right.
(3) Generosity or Altruism.
The third classification of Character or Growth of the
Understanding is represented by the Attitude of the In-
telligence to render to life, the highest degree of service
that it is capable of, without thought or desire for selfish
benefit or personal gain.
This degree or quality of Human Character and growth of
the Intelligence, science names Generosity or Altruism.
Concretely defined, Selfishness is the attitude of the Intelli-
gence that desires to receive more freely than he is willing
to give: Justice is the desire to render an equivalent for
every service received; Generosity or Altruism is the atti-
tude or desire to render CONSTRUCTIVE SERVICE
TO HIS FELLOWMEN, without the motive or desire for
selfish gain or benefit.
All mankind throughout human history has been searching
for and trying to discover or invent a solution to the riddle
of HOW TO LIVE A HARMONIOUS LIFE.
A REALIZATION OF THE ABOVE FACTS SHOULD
POINT THE WAY TO EVERY HUMAN BEING.
44
CHAPTER 3
Care of the Physical Body
HOW DOES THE Process of Receiving and Giving
apply to our physical body?
To sustain the life of the physical body, requires the use
of certain physical substances we name food, water and air
or solids, liquids and gases, which it takes in and this is
therefore a receiving process.
The body also gives off substances we classify as solids,
semi-solids, liquids and gases.
Nature's Law of Mechanics, the Law of Compensation,
demands that we maintain a balance between the intake
and out-go, if we are to sustain the mechanical health of
the body, or suffer the consequences of our errors.
How shall we know what kind of food the body needs?
When it needs it? And when it has had enough?
Each and every normal Individual Intelligence possesses
internal guides that inform the Individual what it needs,
when it needs it, and when it has had enough. (This does
not refer to artificially acquired - abnormal HABITS).
All that is required of each normal Individual is to learn
to listen to this INTERNAL GUIDE and he will not err.
This inner guide produces a sensation we experience as
HUNGER.
That sensation informs us as to when the body needs food,
our sense of taste and smell help to guide us, as to the kind
45
HARMONIOUS LIVING
or quality of that food (under normal conditions), and when
we have had enough, the sensation changes to satiety or
satisfaction.
By careful observation, we will discover that when we have
had sufficiency of food, its taste is altered, it no longer
possesses the same appeal.
When the body is in need of liquids, we experience the
sensation of THIRST.
When that need has been supplied, the same condition of
satisfaction is experienced. We are informed of sufficiency,
just as we are informed of the need.
When the body has accumulated substance it no longer
needs, the internal guides inform the governing Intelli-
gence to remove same.
We feel COLD or HOT.
When those conditions have been adjusted or corrected,
we feel comfortable.
Upon another occasion, we feel SUSPICIOUS, DOUBT-
FUL or PESSIMISTIC.
When the justification for that feeling has been removed,
we feel cheerful, hopeful and confident again.
Under other circumstances we may feel HURT or ANGRY.
When the cause or causes have been removed, we feel
happy.
Sometimes we feel discouraged, friendless, or lonely.
Suddenly we experience a new sensation, we become in-
spired by a feeling of friendliness, optimism, hope and
faith.
In addition to our general sense of feeling, we possess in
our own Individual Right,
A SPECIAL SENSE OF GUIDANCE
WHICH WE MAY DESCRIBE AS
A SUPREME COURT
46
CARE OF THE HUMAN BODY
to refer to, if at any time we are in DOUBT as to the
right course to pursue.
This SUPREME COURT is generally known as CON-
SCIENCE.
The supreme court is composed of two supreme judges.
These JUDGES are REASON and INTUITION.
This supreme court constitutes the highest authority for
the Governing Intelligence.
This supreme court constitutes the Moral and Intellectual
Guide for human conduct.
RIGHT HUMAN CONDUCT establishes and maintains
HEALTH.
Natural Science defines CONSCIENCE as that knowledge
of normal adult Human Intelligence which enables one to
differentiate correctly between RIGHT and WRONG, in
their relation to the Individual himself.
Also, Conscience is the Soul's Recognition of Personal
Responsibility. Without Conscience therefore, Man would
be no more responsible than the animal or the insane for
he would then be without the ability to recognize his
Responsibility.
Again, Conscience is the VOICE of the Intelligent Soul.
When our inner guides inform us, when the physical body
is in need of food, we give it prompt, earnest and faithful
attention.
We need to give the same prompt consideration and faith-
ful attention when our faithful guides inform us that we
have had enough.
Our inner guides WARN US in many ways, when we have
had enough. We are not left in doubt when the normal need
is supplied.
We have little difficulty in hearing the voice of HUNGER
or any of the other NEEDS of the body, and we must
be JUST AS ALERT to the VOICE OF SUFFICIENCY.
47
HARMONIOUS LIVING
It is safer to under-eat, than to eat in excess of the bodily
need and comfort.
Our inner guides function upon every plane of our being,
physical, spiritual, mental, moral and psychological.
We are never without Natural Guidance, if we will only
learn to listen.
CONSCIENCE tells us when a thing is RIGHT or
WRONG, morally, ethically and socially in all our relations
with our fellowmen, up to the degree of our understanding.
No normal human being is DEVOID of this Universal
Guide to the natural path, that leads to Equity, Justice and
Right; which brings Man to his Goal of HEALTH and
HAPPINESS.
If we experience any pain, suffering or any other physical
ailments it is because we have either ignored or violated
our INTERNAL GUIDANCE.
Dis-ease is NOT an accident. A specific Law was violated,
that produced that particular dis-ease or condition that
exists.
Dis-ease is NOT contagious, only in the sense that when
two or more human beings VIOLATE the same LAWS,
they produce the SAME CONDITIONS of Dis-ease within
their bodies. Under the Law of Like produces Like, the
ACTIVE state of a Dis-ease in one person may awaken
the POTENTIAL state of the same Dis-ease in other per-
sons into the ACTIVE state. But the POTENTIAL con-
dition MUST BE THERE before an active state can de-
velop. Just as a broadcasting station projecting a specific
vibration in the atmosphere, will awaken the same vibra-
tions, within any number of receiving sets, that are attuned
to the same vibrations (and no others) and are in range
of the broadcasting field of action.
Dis-ease germs do NOT live upon HEALTHY TISSUE,
neither does HEALTHY TISSUE attract and assimilate
Dis-ease substance.
48
CARE OF THE HUMAN BODY
If and when Dis-ease germs enter our physical body, they
will either be eliminated or die of starvation, IF THEY
DO NOT FIND THE KIND OF IMPURITIES WITHIN
OUR BODY THAT THEY CAN LIVE AND PROSPER
UPON.
A HEALTHY BODY is IMMUNE to DISEASE CON-
TAGION.
A healthy body manufactures its own anti-bodies against
any and every destructive germ, and does not need nor
require inoculation of so-called anti-toxins. The anti-toxins
only increase the burdens of maintaining health.
Every Dis-ease known to human experience CAN BE
CURED OR REMOVED, if the Individual involved will
REMOVE THE CAUSE OR CAUSES and will co-operate
with Nature's efforts in the removal of the accumulated
impurities of the past errors.
Nature does not punish us, WE PUNISH OURSELVES
by the disregard of or the violation of Natural Laws.
There is no permanent CURE for any dis-ease, UNLESS
the Individual involved shall FIRST REMOVE THE
CAUSE OR CAUSES.
EVERY THOUGHT AND EVERY ACT PRODUCES
SPECIFIC AND DEFINITE RESULTS. THESE RE-
SULTS ARE EITHER CONSTRUCTIVE OR DES-
TRUCTIVE and we must LEARN to know in ADVANCE
what those results will be, if we desire to obtain beneficial
results and avoid injurious ones.
This is the PRICE we must PAY, if we expect or hope to
enjoy Health, Harmony and Happiness.
This also is the way to prevent dis-ease and eliminate the
necessity of experiencing the hard way of suffering dis-ease
and undergoing the steep uphill climb to obtain a cure.
NOTHING CAN HELP THE REMOVAL OF DISEASE,
49
HARMONIOUS LIVING
PERMANENTLY, WITHOUT FIRST REMOVING
THE CAUSE.
If the CAUSE is continued, and if by any method what-
soever the effects ARE REMOVED, it would be only tem-
porary, as the continuation of the same CAUSE would re-
produce the SAME EFFECT.
There can be no permanent cure, without first removing
that which generates the condition, its cause.
Health is the result of living a RATIONAL LIFE.
A Rational Life means that we must learn to anticipate the
results of our thoughts and actions.
To anticipate the results of our thoughts and actions, it is
necessary to acquire a KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW OF
CAUSE AND EFFECT.
We acquire a knowledge of the Law of Cause and Effect
by Personal Experience and by observing life around us,
as it demonstrates to us, the functioning of the relations*
of cause and effect.
Examples of HOW the Law of Cause and Effect operates
in the production of dis-eased conditions within the body
will be studied in several later chapters.
By concentration of our observation we will soon discover
the operations and functions of Nature's processes of CON-
STRUCTION and DESTRUCTION, which soon enables
us to think and act in such manner, as to establish and main-
tain Health and Harmony in our Individual lives, and pre-
vent dis-ease and suffering.
IT IS THEN THAT WE BECOME ABLE TO BE OF
SERVICE TO OUR FELLOWMEN.
It is then that we can begin to REPAY Nature and our
fellowmen for all the vast benefits we have received, while
in the process of our Self-development and the growth of
our Rational Intelligence.
50
CHAPTER 4
How We Acquire Knowledge
MAN, TO BE ABLE to obey Nature's Laws, must pos-
sess knowledge of them.
To assist man in acquiring some of this knowledge there
are available to him the text works of the various branches
of Scientific Research, physical, spiritual, mental, moral
and psychological.
These various branches of Natural Science have accumu-
lated a vast quantity of demonstrated and verified facts of
Nature, each in their own field of endeavor.
This data has been organized, systematized, and classified
and expressed in simple scientific terminology and is made
available to the public, in the form of text books that can
be secured in the major libraries of our Nation.
In the search for a knowledge of the Principles and Laws
that govern and determine HEALTH in the life of man,
the author has been granted the privilege to draw upon
and quote from this vast storehouse of accumulated knowl-
edge of these various branches of Science as freely as the
need requires.
The titles of the particular text books of Natural Science
that have been drawn upon and quoted from freely are
as follows

The term Natural Science will be used herein, when refer-
ring to all the various branches of science as a unit (physi-
cal, spiritual, mental, moral and psychological).
Through man's use of his Physical Body, he becomes aware
of some of the processes, activities and functions of matter
upon the physical plane of life.
The five physical sense organs, seeing, hearing, smelling,
tasting and feeling constitute the major physical organs,
that contact, measure and transmit to our Consciousness,
physical brain and the Mind, the vibrations of physical
matter, that are in tune with our Individual physical bodies.
They are simultaneously recorded upon Consciousness, the
physical brain, spiritual brain and the Mind (acting through
the principle of a transformer), for the USE of the GOV-
ERNING INTELLIGENCE.
The physical brain is a physical branch library of the re-
corded physical experience of the Individual Intelligence;
as they occur, they are then recorded in the main or general
library, the Mind, which contains ALL THE EXPERI-
ENCES OF THE INDIVIDUAL INTELLIGENCE,
physical, spiritual, mental, moral, and psychological, or-
ganized, systematized, and classified, covering the ES-
SENCE of its past Self-Conscious experience.
Nature has also supplied man with an efficient clerk, whose
duty or function it is to record and reproduce the records
of the Mind and branch libraries, as they are needed by the
Individual Intelligence, and we name this clerk RECOL-
LECTION.
52
HOW WE ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE
The physical brain record constitutes man's Personal ex-
perience and knowledge of physical phenomena, which
enables him to adjust himself Intelligently to his physical
environment.
There are also finer forces, activities, processes and func-
tions in Nature, beyond the power and ability of the
physical body to contact or register. The Microscope, the
Telescope and the Photographic Lens are physical instru-
ments, demonstrating the physical limitations of Man's
physical sense organs. The Radio is another physical instru-
ment demonstrating the existence of finer vibrations than
the physical body is able to detect.
In Nature there are still finer or higher vibrations, than
any known physical instrument has been able to detect,
and are beyond the capacity of the physical body to contact
and reproduce.
Nature has furnished man with an appropriate instrument
that is adapted to that purpose, so as to enable him to
obtain a knowledge of those finer forces and activities.
Natural Science names this finer instrument The Spiritual
Body, so as to distinguish it from the Physical Body.
The physical and spiritual bodies are exact duplicates of
each other in form, structure and function, their chief dif-
ference being in the degree of vibration each receives,
registers and reproduces of the phenomena in nature
(which represents the degree of fineness of the atoms they
contain, their atomic weights). Both bodies function under
the same Principles and Laws of vibration, as the Radio
built by man, broadcasting and receiving the vibrations of
matter.
The physical body contacts and reproduces the longer,
slower moving vibrations that are within its own limitations
upon the physical plane, while the spiritual body similarly
contacts and reproduces some of the shorter and faster
moving vibrations (within its own limitations upon the
53
HARMONIOUS LIVING
spiritual plane), which are named spiritual vibrations, to
differentiate them from the physical ones.
The five spiritual sense organs, seeing, hearing, smelling,
tasting and feeling, function similarly as the physical sense
organs.
Each organ contacting and recording the vibrations of
spiritual matter within their own limitations, they are then
recognized by Consciousness and registered upon the
Spiritual brain and the Mind, simultaneously, for the USE
of the GOVERNING INTELLIGENCE.
The physical body and the spiritual body occupy the same
volume, but not the same space. The spiritual body occu-
pies the interspaces between the coarser physical particles,
the two bodies functioning Harmoniously together, just as
Radio waves function together with their first, second, third
and fourth Harmonics, the coarser or longer waves, enclos-
ing the finer (shorter) ones, the finer waves occupying the
same volume but not the same space as the coarser waves.
The Individual Intelligence possesses, occupies and governs
both of these bodies, and through them it becomes aware of
the activities and functions of nature upon the physical
and spiritual plane of matter, that are in tune with them.
Man possesses a still finer means of communication, the
MIND.
Individual Intelligence is capable of communicating with
other human beings, by purely mental processes, which we
name Mental Telepathy.
Through the process of thought we are able to broadcast
our ideas through space, which enables those who are in
tune with the same vibrations, to receive the thoughts. We
are likewise able to receive the thoughts of those others
with whom we are in Harmony. We are able to do this,
without the use of either the physical or spiritual bodies,
by purely mental processes, under the same mechanical laws
54
HOW WE ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE
that govern radio broadcasting and receiving processes,
through the Law that like produces like.
Man is capable of tuning in with the mental vibrations in
space, that are (in tune) in Harmony with his own vibra-
tions or character of thought.
The process of acquiring knowledge through experience
is a continuous activity of the Intelligence, through all its
various receiving channels, and upon all the spheres and
conditions of his changing environment.
It is man's privilege, as well as his normal occupation in
life, to acquire a knowledge of the Laws, Principles and
Functions, governing the various planes of his activities,
thereby enabling him to direct his life, so as to harmonize
with nature's Constructive laws, that guide him.
There are physical laws that govern the physical body.
There are spiritual laws that govern the spiritual body and
moral laws that govern the thoughts and activities of the
Individual Intelligence.
When man concentrates his attention upon the physical
plane of matter through the use of his physical body, he
acquires a knowledge of physical phenomena and physical
conditions.
When man's physical body goes to sleep, it means that
Consciousness has closed the physical sense channels of the
physical body upon the physical plane of matter, and it has
simultaneously opened the spiritual sense organs and cen-
tered them upon the spiritual plane of action, through its
spiritual body, where and when it obtains spiritual infor-
mation and experience, just as it obtained physical experi-
ence upon the physical plane, through the physical body.
What is generally called INTUITION is in reality
SPIRITUAL PERCEPTION, obtained through the spirit-
ual body's experience, just as physical sensation constitutes
physical experience.
Physically embodied human beings in general are not aware
55
HARMONIOUS LIVING
of the fact that they possess a spiritual body, although they
function with and through it, more or less regularly, either
Consciously or Semi-Consciously. The information is
transmitted to Consciousness but the average Intelligence
has not learned how to identify and separate the source or
channel through which the information is received, and to
differentiate the vibrations that reach Consciousness
through the physical channels from those coming through
the spiritual sense organs.
Every human being receives more or less consciously, sen-
sations and experiences that we describe or name, Instinct,
Intuition, Premonitions, Hunches, Visions, Inspirations,
Thought Transferences and many other varieties of Con-
sciousness or awareness of our Being tuned in with the
finer forces, activities and processes in Nature.
These experiences are and ever have been, throughout hu-
man history, the common experiences of practically all of
the human race.
They have been too numerous and too Universal an experi-
ence to be ignored or to be disregarded.
They must be scientifically investigated, identified and veri-
fied and acknowledged, just as physical phenomena have
been carefully investigated, verified and acknowledged, if
we are to learn and understand more about this complex
Being we call Man, and HOW we may acquire that precious
state of being we name HEALTH, as well as how to main-
tain it when acquired.
By mentally organizing, classifying, systematizing and re-
cording these experiences, and with the exercise and use
of recollection, man is enabled to become aware of some
of nature's functions, laws and principles which enable him
to understand and comprehend, that which is beneficial to
Life, Health, and Happiness, and to be able to avoid that
which, in any manner, is detrimental or in opposition to
the harmony of his existence. In other words, to know
56
HOW WE ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE
HOW to build and maintain Health, Harmony and Happi-
ness, and to understand WHY, when Health and Harmony
are absent, as well as what is necessary to re-establish them.
As Free Willed Moral Beings, we possess the power and
ability (to the degree of our Intelligence) to build our
lives, as we would wish them to be, just as easily and surely
as we are able to plan and build a house, an automobile, a
radio, an airplane, or any other mechanism.
It is in this sense, that it can be truthfully said, that Life
is what we make it.
With the application and use of our Intelligence and power
of Will, who may Wisely put a limit upon the Constructive
possibilities of human thought and activity?
57
CHAPTER 5
Law of Compensation
1 HERE IS A LAW in physical nature which is known
as the Law of Compensation. It is a Law of Mechanics. It
operates with mathematical exactness and precision. The
results are susceptible of definite calculation and verifica-
tion.
It is recognized everywhere in the world by physical
science. It is immutable, so far as science knows. Under
this mechanical Law, Nature exacts something in return
for everything she grants. She does not give without re-
ceiving something in return. She does not always demand
of us that we pay in kind. She does, however, demand a
full equivalent.
If Man, as an Individual Intelligence, were nothing more
than a mechanical device and as such, responded automatic-
ally to the Laws of Mechanics, the problem of Life would
be as simple as the multiplication table, or the simplest
problem in mathematics.
In that event, all our actions and reactions, would be as
automatic and mechanical as are those of the chemical
atoms of the physical Universe.
As automatons, we would have no choice of action. We
would satisfy the Law, but it would be automatic or
mechanical satisfaction and not a voluntary or Intelligent
one, from the standpoint of an Individual.
Chemical atoms act and are acted upon automatically.
58
LAW OF COMPENSATION
Machines that are invented and constructed by men, act
mechanically. In neither case is there power of individual
choice in the actor. In both cases the Law of Compensation
is satisfied. The giving and receiving exactly balance each
other.
Because the processes involved are automatic and mechan-
ical, the results may be determined in advance and with
mathematical precision. This is the realm of mathematics
or Mechanical Science.
Man is NOT an AUTOMATON nor a MECHANICAL
DEVICE. As an Individual Intelligence, he rises to a plane
above the plane of simple mechanics. His actions and re-
actions, being largely VOLUNTARY, do not lend them-
selves to the rules of simple mathematics.
For this reason they cannot be determined in advance, by
the application of mathematical rules or mechanical Prin-
ciples, with absolute certainty and precision.
If this were not so, man would become an automaton.
In that event, it would be possible to reduce him to a
mathematical calculation and determine at his birth, every
act, thought, impulse and inspiration of his life, from that
instant to the time of his death, however long his life.
There is that in man, which lifts him above the level of
mere automatonism and simple mechanics. As an Individual
Intelligence, he possesses certain attributes which make
him a Law unto himself within certain limitations.
The powers of Will and Choice do not operate automatic-
ally, nor in accordance with the Law of Mechanics. They
are powers of a Self-Acting Intelligent Soul.
From the standpoint of science, man occupies a most inter-
esting position. For all scientific and philosophic purposes,
each Individual Intelligence is from his own point of view,
the center of the Universe.
In this unique position he stands as a target for all the
59
HARMONIOUS LIVING
forces and influences of Nature. He constitutes the natural
vortex, wherein the Constructive and Destructive forces
and processes of Nature are forever contending for su-
premacy.
By the majesty of his Individual Will alone, can their issue
be determined. While he is a creature of the Great Law,
yet he alone must determine if he will respect that Law.
By the power of Individual Choice and the exercise of his
Will alone, he may co-operate with either the Constructive
or Destructive forces of Nature. He alone may determine
his own destiny.
He can at no time EVADE or AVOID the Law of Com-
pensation. He can at no time, place himself outside the
limits of its jurisdiction. IN SO FAR AS HE CON-
FORMS HIS LIFE TO THE CONSTRUCTIVE PRIN-
CIPLE, HE NOT ONLY EARNS NATURE'S REWARD
THEREFORE, BUT HE MUST RECEIVE IT.
In so far as he patronizes the DESTRUCTIVE PRIN-
CIPLE, in just that far he EARNS NATURE'S PENAL-
TY THEREFORE and he MUST RECEIVE it.
In the realm of Morality THE LAW OF COMPENSA-
TION IS INEXORABLE.
It is the great leveler. It is ever seeking to establish
equilibrium, by rounding off the rough corners of Human
Character and filling in the low places, to bring the whole
to a common level.
It is no respecter of persons, it binds all and favors none.
The Law of Compensation is one of the great and profound
facts of Nature.
It is desired to emphasize the fact also, that it is as much
and as truly a factor in the Moral order of the Universe,
as it is in the realm of Physical Nature. It is not a thing
of man's creation or invention. Its penalties are fixed and
immutable and they apply to all men.

CHAPTER 6
Equity—Justice—Right
EQUITY IS THE process of meting out the principle
of right as between two or more individuals.
JUSTICE is the process of meting out the principle of
right with reference to one Individual.
RIGHT is the great underlying Universal Principle upon
which both Equity and Justice are meted out or determined.
The same Laws and Principles that govern the health of
Individual human beings apply to the family relations,
organized groups of human beings, governments, nations
and humanity as a whole.
Governments are organized for the purpose of guiding
Individual human relations, and the maintaining of EQUI-
TY, JUSTICE, and RIGHTEOUSNESS.
Basically, there are three major forms of government.
They are:
(1) Monarchy
(2) Republic
(3) Democracy
Monarchy. The ideal of a moral Monarchy is based upon
the principle of the father-mother relationship to children.
The meaning and purpose of Monarchial Government is to
direct the activities of the early development of human
beings, who have not yet attained to an understanding of
moral self-government.
61
HARMONIOUS LIVING
(2) A Republic is a form of Social Government, wherein
the citizens of that government select from amongst them-
selves, by a majority or plurality vote, the individuals to
whom they delegate the power and the right to formulate
the Laws (based upon Equity, Justice and Right) that are
to govern the people as a whole, as well as the power to
enforce those laws.
(3) Democracy represents a state of Social Organization
and Government wherein the citizenship (by vote of the
majority or plurality) elect the individuals, to whom they
empower the authority to formulate the laws that are de-
sired by the membership that elect them, also the power to
enforce the laws.
The chosen representatives of a Democracy act merely as
servants to carry out the Will of those who empowered or
elected them.
Under a Democracy, any form of government may be
established that the majority may desire. Even a Monarch-
ial Government, if the majority believe that a single In-
dividual possesses the character of Intelligence, honesty
and WISDOM that is SUPERIOR to that of the COL-
LECTIVE MAJORITY itself.
The majority always retain the right and power to with-
draw that authority at any time, if they so choose.
ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT can function SUC-
CESSFULLY, when conducted upon the Principle of
EQUITY, JUSTICE and RIGHT.
ANY CONCEIVABLE FORM OF GOVERNMENT must
eventually FAIL, regardless of how perfect the form, if it
is administered selfishly or unjustly.
In Social Life, as well as in Individual Life, to maintain
Health and Harmony, they must be governed by the Moral
Law in Nature. Even a so-called Anarchistic Society, com-
posed of people who object to man made laws, are still
subject to Absolute Law, whether they know it or not or
62
EQUITY—JUSTICE—RIGHT
whether they desire it or not; they are never-the-less gov-
erned by the irrevocable Laws of Nature, which govern
every thought and every act.
So far as is humanly known, there does not seem to be any-
thing in existence that is outside of the jurisdiction of
Nature's Laws.
Obeying those Laws results in the only freedom possible
to human beings. Any other so-called freedom constitutes
a license and must be paid for according to the character
of the violation of Nature's Laws.
Perfect Freedom can exist only when there is but a single
Individual involved. When two or more Individuals are
associated together, Equality of Freedom is the only Moral
Freedom.
Equality of Freedom is what Natural Law demands of every
human being who desires or expects to enjoy Peace, Har-
mony, Health and Happiness.
When human desires, motives and conduct are in harmony
with the Constructive Principle in Individual Life, then
man enjoys the greatest degree of freedom possible for his
attainment, for he thereby adds the unlimited powers of
nature to his own plan of action.
Of all the complex problems that life presents to man fof
his solution under the law of balance (or Equity, Justice
& Right), the intricate problem of establishing an equitable
standard of function as a medium of exchange for human
effort is perhaps the most difficult.
Throughout the past, the medium of exchange has been a
variable, subject to human manipulation. Scientific methods
use natural constants as units of measurement for material
substance and its relations. As for example, an inch as a
unit of space or extension; a pint as a unit of volume; an
ounce as a unit of gravitational pull and a second as a unit
of time.
63
HARMONIOUS LIVING
To establish a just medium of exchange for human effort
is very difficult. No two human beings are alike, their out-
put varies, even in the same individual the output varies
at different times.
The nearest approach to a just medium of exchange would
seem to be a constant, so as to approach as near as possible,
the natural, normal standard of Equity, Justice and Right
and thereby maintain the Health of the Nation.
TIME could perform that function.
Every human being's day is divided into twenty-four hours
per day. The hour of service could represent a unit cons-
tant, as an exchange medium, from the view point of time.
From the view point of product produced, it would still
represent a variable, but under modern mechanical means
of production, where products are produced collectively,
an average would seem to be required, and calculation
would need to be based upon that Principle in industry.
It does not seem to be possible to measure human effort
and its product, except upon the basis of the collective
average.
There are three major efforts, in their attempts to solve
this age old problem to establish and maintain equitable
human relations. They are:
Competitive Industry
Socialism
Communism.
(1) Competitive Industry represents the Principle of the
survival of the fittest, wherein the field is wide open to the
expression of Individual initiative and acquirement, where-
in the weak must become strong enough to survive or fail.
Competitive Industry is based upon the profit motive and
Individual ownership over all the Individual can acquire
under the profit system and the directive power over all
that has been acquired.
64
EQUITY—JUSTICE—RIGHT
Under Competitive Industry the strong can use their com-
bined strength, to overcome the strength of the weaker
groups, until such a time as Nations combine under a Unit
Government to maintain, Equity, Justice and Right. A Unit
Government of the Nations of the Earth is the simplest,
easiest and surest way to prevent WARS, WASTE and
many other forms of destruction.
The destructive waste in life, that could be avoided, would
supply the needs and comforts for the human family, if
wisely conserved.
A World Government is based upon CO-OPERATION.
WAR springs from COMPETITION.
A World Government's duties and obligations are to serve
and protect the welfare of each and every human being,
and the duty and obligation of each and every human being
is to devote their efforts and energies for the welfare of
the Government.
This is the true meaning of Organization. The whole is to
serve each and every part, while every part serves the whole.
This means efficiency, economy and growth; that is the
moral way and the way to success, the way of prevention
of dis-ease, the perpetuation of Individual Life as well as
the collective body. This is the way of the Constructive
Principle of Evolution.
The Individual, the family, the social circle, the nation and
the race, evolve or de-volve under the operation of this
principle of evolution or devolution, functioning like the
waves of the ocean, forward and backward, progressing
forward continuously after each cycle, by developing a
knowledge of construction and destruction, while under-
going this process of evolution.
Competition means to excel, regardless of its effects upon
the competitor.
Co-operation tends to Individual Development, without the
motive or desire to out-do the other person.
65
HARMONIOUS LIVING
Competition can express itself constructively, as well as
destructively but it is very difficult to maintain Construc-
tive Competition.
Constructive Competition demands that each Individual
Respect and Honor the Successful Competitor with a gen-
uine feeling of friendship.
Under Constructive Competition each Individual must con-
duct life's activities by the standards of Equity, Justice and
Right, regardless of the activities of others. Any Individual
can and may live a just life and prosper, even in a com-
munity of more or less injustice. This may seem untrue, at
a brief glance, but this must be tried out and tested, before
it can be justly questioned.
Nature has many ways to maintain the Law of Compensa-
tion. Man may unbalance things for awhile, but nature
sees to it that the scale is balanced for each and every
Individual.
While it is true that nature has given man the power of a
Free Will, it is also true that if man misuses or abuses that
Free Will, he thereby weakens that power and if he persists
in mis-using it, he soon reaches a point of exhaustion of that
power of Will and becomes an automatic instrument of en-
vironment or in danger of becoming so.
It is either self-control or the loss of it. Once more we are
made aware of the fact that Life is what we make it. We
may make it a success under any form of government or it
can be made a failure under the most perfect form of
government.
It is up to us as Individuals, regardless of man-made in-
justices. A Negro or Negress who are kind and loving, and
under man-made laws are held in slavery, can and do make
a supreme success of their lives, while at the same time
shaming the self-assumed slave owner, and when their
physical lives are over, what has been the value of the slave
holder's life and what the value of the negroes' lives?
66
EQUITY—JUSTICE—RIGHT
All systems of government are based upon IDEALS and
fulfill a need in social life in their time and place, IF
CARRIED OUT ACCORDING TO THE PLAN OF THE
IDEAL.
IT IS THE FAILURE TO FULFILL THE LAW, that
causes friction, discord, dis-ease and WAR, Individually
and Collectively.
(2) Socialism represents an effort to establish a means or
method of Social-Government, wherein each Individual
would receive his or her own share of the social product,
based upon the amount of effort put in, measured in time
and ability.
Ownership would be held by the people as a whole. Pos-
session and use of the product would be distributed, ac-
cording to the amount of effort expressed and the average
value of the product within a unit of time. In other words,
it is an effort to establish and maintain Equity, Justice
and Right.
The purpose and motive being to eliminate unearned profit,
and to render to each, his or her just due. This would be
based upon the social average value of product.
(3) Communism in its ideal as a form of government, is
based upon the Principle of Generosity, that is, the strong
using their strength to build up the strength of the weak.
Each sharing in the product according to their need, if
supply is abundant, otherwise based upon supply and Equi-
ty and regardless of their ability to produce.
Ownership being held Collectively and possession and use
of products according to need, if supply is abundant and
equitably adjusted in cases of shortages.
Each Individual rendering services to the whole according
to ability and in harmony with the Plan of the Community.
In its final analysis the form of a government is not the
determining factor in a successful society, but the manner
67
HARMONIOUS LIVING
of its administration and the degree of Equity, Justice and
Righteousness maintained in its application to all human
relations in the social organism; and the success of this
function is dependent upon the character and quality of
education maintained throughout its membership.
Constructive Education is the very foundation of a success-
ful government. Without KNOWLEDGE and UNDER-
STANDING Intelligent activity is not humanly possible.
Every child needs to unfold its natural, normal sense of
Right and Wrong. Then, and then only, will we have the
right to anticipate a Healthy and Successful state of hu-
man relations.
68
CHAPTER 7
Education
EDUCATION IS THE PROCESS by which an Indi-
vidual Intelligence acquires a definite and personal knowl-
edge of the facts of nature, in all the realms of human
interest, physical, spiritual, mental, moral and psychical.
It is also, the accumulated knowledge thus acquired.
Through Education as to the Laws, Principles and forces,
activities and processes of mechanical nature, man obtains
the foundation of knowledge, which enables him to under-
stand, appreciate and rightly apply that knowledge under
the moral law.
The moral law of nature governs the relations between hu-
man beings only, and NOT the forces and activities of
material substance. Knowledge acquired from mechanical
nature represents the reward for suffering and hardship,
in acquiring it.
We must first know what is RIGHT and WRONG before
we can act Intelligently and Wisely.
We may become masters of the laws of mechanics, and yet
destroy ourselves and others, unless we acquire a personal
knowledge of RIGHT and WRONG, which means an
understanding of the moral law, which makes itself known
as the Law of Compensation and Retribution or CON-
STRUCTION & DESTRUCTION.
The most important single lesson that any human being
can learn is a SENSE of RIGHT and WRONG.
69
HARMONIOUS LIVING
Without this definite and specific knowledge a human being
goes through life, blind-folded and subject to falling into
every error it contacts.
A knowledge of RIGHT and WRONG is the very founda-
tion of a SUCCESSFUL life.
One may develop a vast amount of mechanical knowledge
and yet become a menace to himself and others, if that
knowledge is not governed by the Law of Morality.
Knowledge of itself, without the added knowledge and
ability to RIGHTLY USE IT, becomes a DANGER in
place of an ASSET.
A knowledge of Right and Wrong should be and MUST
BECOME the Principle and Basic Subject of our educa-
tional curriculum, from the kindergarten to the master's
degree.
Without this basic Principle being gradually absorbed by
the human mind from its earliest rational unfoldment, life
loses much of its meaning and purpose.
It is this element in our educational curriculum that has
been overshadowed and largely lost sight of, in its supreme
and determining power over the successful living of a life,
Individually and Collectively.
It is this basic missing element that must be supplied, to
each and every human soul upon the face of the earth, if
we desire peace, harmony, health and happiness, for our-
selves and our fellowmen.
Intuition and Inspiration has guided the few in the human
family to protect the rest of us from collective suicide, up
to the present time.
As science has increased its knowledge and control over
some of nature's more powerful forces and made that
knowledge available to everyone, regardless of their desire
to rightly use it, it becomes the solemn duty of every human
being who assumes the responsibility of guiding the
70
EDUCATION
thoughts and activities of their fellowmen, to emphatically
emphasize the DANGER and RESPONSIBILITY THAT
UNDERLIES THE MIS-USE of any knowledge obtained
from the collective human experience.
Practically all our knowledge and discoveries are based
upon the accumulated experiences of all humanity through-
out its entire history.
The question of RIGHT and WRONG is of such supreme
and fundamental importance to each and every human be-
ing, that it does not seem superfluous to emphasize, repeat
and perpetuate the continuity of this vital KEY to a" suc-
cessful life, for the Individual and for humanity as a whole.
A knowledge of RIGHT and WRONG based upon
NATURAL LAW.
NATURAL GUIDANCE as to what is humanly Right and
Wrong is that which is CONSTRUCTIVE in human life,
is moral and RIGHT; and that which is DESTRUCTIVE
to human life is immoral and humanly WRONG.
This same standard applies equally to the family, to or-
ganic groups of human beings and to nations, governments
and to humanity as a whole.
Once a human being acquires a knowledge of RIGHT &
WRONG, he has attained to his natural Majority or Ma-
turity, Intellectually and Morally, and he thereby becomes
a citizen of the World, as well as a true and normal member
of the Brotherhood of Man, and would not intentionally
harm anyone.
He then knows, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that if he
attempts to harm any human being, he thereby harms him-
self more than he can injure anyone else, for if he actually
does some harm to another person, he and he alone is the
criminal and not the person that was harmed.
And under Nature's law of Morality he must compensate
for the harm that he did or suffer the consequences. Sooner
71
HARMONIOUS LIVING
or later he must pay and pay in full with suffering as
interest.
A knowledge of RIGHT & WRONG, based upon nature's
binding law of Morality would revolutionize the human
race within half a century; for what sane human being
would deliberately, knowingly and intentionally punish
himself?
That would mean that a sane human being would prefer
PAIN, SUFFERING and MISERY to HARMONY,
PEACE, HEALTH and HAPPINESS.
All our troubles are the children of ignorance, therefore
this great emphasis upon the value, power and significance
of TRUE EDUCATION, that is a knowledge of RIGHT
& WRONG, that will withstand the tests of science, con-
form to the demands of Philosophy and fulfill the hopes and
aspirations of Religion.
72
CHAPTER 8
Thinking
Related To Health
THINKING IS THE PROCESS by means of which the
Individual Intelligence or Soul, manifesting through its
attributes, operates upon its material brain and sensory
organism.
What are attributes ? Attributes are the modes of the Soul's
expression or manifestation. The abilities or capacities of
the soul to express or manifest itself, through its material
bodies, on the plane of its habitation.
The attributes divide themselves into two general classes,
on the basis of their functions or uses. One of these is
receptive, the other aggressive. The receptive ones are
Capacities or Faculties. The aggressive ones are Powers.
Capacities or Faculties appear to be dependent upon
Natural Laws and conditions (for their operation) over
which the Soul does not necessarily exercise Individual
control. They are negative, passive or receptive in nature.
Powers are the positive or active attributes of the Soul.
These are under the control of the Individual Intelligence
and operate because the Individual takes the initiative and
sets them in motion.
Every impulse emanating from the Soul, and vibrating
through the material brain, produces a phenomenon which
we call a THOUGHT. An orderly sequence ot tnese con-
stitute the process which we know as THOUGHT or
THINKING.
73
HARMONIOUS LIVING
It is a natural process, common in various degrees, to every
Individual human Intelligence. It is one of the established
facts of nature and as such, subject to its laws.
THINKING is an activity of the Intellect.
Intellect is the aggregate of the Intelligent activities of
the Individual Intelligence or Soul, the function of which
is to KNOW and UNDERSTAND.
MIND is the sum total of all the Intelligent activities of
the Individual Intelligence or Soul.
Intellect is a part of the Mind, that part which knows and
understands; while Mind itself embraces all the phenomena
produced by the Individual Intelligence, manifesting itself
through its several attributes.
While on the physical plane, the Soul manifests itself pri-
marily through the physical brain.
As the musician, seated at the organ, moves his fingers over
the keys, striving to give expression to the emotions that
surge through his being, so the soul plays upon its material
instruments, the physical and spiritual brains, endeavoring
to manifest upon the material plane, those tremendous
energies which vibrate through its essence. Every touch
upon the keys of the organ produce a musical sound, which
we call a note. A succession of these, echoing in orderly
harmony and rhythm, sends a symphony pulsating through
our listening ears.
THOUGHTS are the phenomena produced by the impulses
of the Individual Intelligence or Soul, manifesting through
the attributes, upon the material brain and sensory organ-
ism.
This process and activity is employed by the Soul, through
its material instruments, upon all the planes of life and
action on which it abides throughout its evolutionary
progress. From the view point of physical life, we naturally
give predominance to the phenomena of our every day
existence on the plane of physical matter. Most of us are
74
THINKING RELATED TO HEALTH
not even conscious that the Soul employs the same process
and the same activities, upon the spiritual plane. This is
due to the fact that we are neither able to raise these im-
pressions above the threshold of physical consciousness nor
use our spiritual senses in comprehending them.
Thinking is in all essential particulars, an ACTIVE pro-
cess. It depends upon the Soul itself to initiate, maintain
and carry to conclusion, every step involved. Should that
activity cease for an instant, in that precise moment the
process would stop.
It is an intense activity. It is the activity of an essence
vibrating with many times the rapidity of physical or even
spiritual material, yet with a force that transmits its energy
down through the spiritual, magnetic and all other forms
and degrees of fineness and rapidity of vibration, and sets
in motion the vastly coarser material of the physical brain
and sensory organism, producing the phenomenon we know
as thought.
It is the fact that thinking is an active process that furnishes
the Key to the development of the Faculties, Capacities
and Powers of the Intelligent Soul—which constitutes the
development of the Soul itself. It also supplies us with a
scientific basis for the necessity of Self-Effort in that ac-
complishment. It likewise outlines for us certain lines of
thought to be avoided.
So far as is scientifically known, the Individual Intelligence
or Soul never sleeps; in other words it is always active.
For instance, during our waking hours we are continually
conscious; that is, we are aware of what is going on about
us. From this we know that the soul is active during all of
the time. But we are likewise aware, if we have given any
attention to the matter at all, that there are various degrees,
or kinds of modes of that activity, ranging all the way from
the faintest glimmerings when we wake from slumber, to
the intense, earnest, energetic efforts we put forth in the
strenuous endeavor to accomplish some much desired ob-
75
HARMONIOUS LIVING
ject.. Yet every one of these graduations is some degree of
activity.
It is evident, therefore, that we must form a definite con-
cept of the Character of activity involved in the process of
real thinking. This must be an intensified activity. It is of
necessity a sustained effort. It requires the wakeful, con-
centrated animation of all the soul attributes. It must be
directed to the accomplishment of a definite purpose. It
necessitates a basic foundation in sincere soul desire.
While the process of thinking can be carried on in the
correct attitude of soul, that is attentively, without refer-
ence to the purpose of such thinking, there is one vital
element which must enter into the operation, if we are to
make right use of our Faculties and Powers. That element
is the MORAL phase of it.
Strive as we may, we cannot escape from the consequences
of WRONG thinking, which are the exact opposite of the
results we are seeking to attain. To indulge in this kind of
thought only cultivates the weeds that try to obtain foot-
hold and flourish in the garden of the mind, which, unless
exterminated, will crowd all that growth from which we
hope and expect to garner the harvest of health, harmony
and happiness.
It is impossible to THINK EVIL and DO GOOD.
Let all our THINKING, therefore, be in conformity with
the Moral law. Let us banish from our thoughts all that
can sap or undermine the wondrous edifice that we are try-
ing to build, the Temple of Character, wherein we are to
abide forever.
We know that man has the ability to use all his faculties
and powers either to assist nature in his evolutionary prog-
ress, to resist Nature's efforts in that direction, or by taking
a neutral course, become merely a drifter on the sea of Life.
Since those activities express themselves in the process of
thinking, we have a right to expect that the phenomena
76
THINKING RELATED TO HEALTH
caused by those activities will conform to, and manifest,
the attitude of soul of an Individual, at any given time.
Such is the fact all about us. We see Individuals represent-
ing every possible phase of this attitude of soul, clearly and
unmistakably.
Thus it appears that we can exercise the process of thinking
either CONSTRUCTIVELY OR DESTRUCTIVELY OR
BOTH, as suits our pleasure. This also IS A FACT, the
full force and significance of which SHOULD NOT ES-
CAPE US, but be burned into the fiber of our being.
When we examine ourselves in the quiet of retirement, we
know and confess that our Thought Life is a strange inter-
mingling of Constructive and Destructive thinking. We
realize that it presents a constantly changing panorama of
conflicting thoughts, good, bad, indifferent and mixed.
We know well, if we stop to think, that WE and we alone
are responsible for this condition. We know also that the
remedy lies with ourselves. We must think RIGHT if we
would be RIGHT. The old maxim "as a man thinketh in
his heart, so is he", thus assumes the force and dignity of
a law of nature.
Here is the great battle ground that confronts every soul
genuinely desirous of its own peace, health and happiness.
It is here that the battle for HEALTH is to be WON OR
LOST.
This is the emblem emblazoned on the banner of the VIC-
TOR:
SELF - CONTROL ESTABLISHED AND MAIN-
TAINED OVER EVERY ACTIVITY OF THE SOUL
WINS SUCCESS.
We have learned that Constructive Thinking consists in
maintaining that attitude of soul wherein its energies are
positively, actively and devotedly attentive to the accom-
plishment of a Moral Purpose. It is but a short step to the
realization that Destructive Thinking is indulgence in an
77
HARMONIOUS LIVING
attitude of soul that is opposed to, inactive, negative or
inertly in-attentive to the Living of a Moral Life.
This is true for many reasons. First, because it is a useless
waste of valuable time. Life at best, is very short for the
accomplishment of those objects and purposes which occa-
sion our being here. Every moment diverted from the at-
tainment of those objects and purposes is a moment lost,
and whether we realize it or not, delays the day of our
triumph over DISEASE and the attainment of health and
happiness.
Again, Indulgence in these negative conditions has a strong
tendency to increase the frequency and duration of these
inert lapses from the right attitude of soul.
Climbing is arduous toil, while one can fall a long way
without effort. This makes it possible to retrogress more
in an hour than we have climbed all day.
THOUGHT is a FORCE.
We have learned that Thought is an activity. This implies
power, which means force. We know by experience that
Thought is a creative force, an impelling force, a motive
force, a very persistently sustaining force. It is the most
powerful factor in the progress of the world today.
Intelligent cultivation and direction of its marvelous po-
tentialities will harness them, and place the reins in our
hands. Then we can drive where we will.
Our ability to think correctly, constructively, accurately
and powerfully CAN BE DEVELOPED. All that is neces-
sary is to DO IT.
The only equipment we need, Nature has supplied us. No
costly apparatus is required. The only process necessary
is the continued exercise of all our soul attributes, actively
and earnestly in conformity with the Constructive Prin-
ciple of nature, the great Law of Morality.
The only condition is that we shall make the RIGHT USE
of all our Faculties and Powers.
78
THINKING RELATED TO HEALTH
For our neglect to do so, nature has its penalties. For our
persistent self-effort to accomplish the task, she has in
store for us the reward of harmony, health and happiness.
We are our own masters. We are what we have made our-
selves. We can make of ourselves what we will.
Man possessing a FREE WILL, is able to lower his vibra-
tion, maintain its normal status, or increase it, by the quali-
ty or character of his thinking.
The more capable man becomes in directing his thoughts
and activities along Constructive and Harmonious lines,
the greater becomes the degree, quality and volume of- his
living a successful, healthy and happy life.
Nature or Natural Law has built for man a physical Garden
of Eden.
Everything is here that is necessary for his health and hap-
piness.
All he needs to do is to learn how to live his life so as to
enjoy this infinite generosity of the Great Creative Intelli-
gence.
God, or Nature or the Universal Intelligence has made but
one request of man, and that request (through natural law)
is THAT HE SO LIVE that he DOES NOT TRESPASS
upon the EQUAL RIGHTS of his fellowmen.
That is the significance and true meaning and Principle
behind the Biblical story of the forbidden fruit upon the
forbidden tree in the Garden of Eden.
The FORBIDDEN TREE is symbolically the DESTRUC-
TIVE PRINCIPLE in nature.
And the FRUIT upon the TREE is SELFISHNESS.
He who, knowingly and intentionally PERSISTS upon
living a LIFE OF SELFISHNESS, surely and inevitably
subjects himself to the operation of the DESTRUCTIVE
PROCESS in nature, which ultimately leads to disintegra-
79
HARMONIOUS LIVING
tion, decay, death and destruction of the bodily instru-
ments, through which the Intelligence of man expresses
itself and makes itself known to other selves, and this is
truly the way of death.
And so, once more we have been brought to a realization
that for man, LIFE IS WHAT HE MAKES IT, and that he
has the God given RIGHT to determine his own destiny.
HE MAY LIVE, LEARN, PROSPER and ENJOY
HEALTH, HARMONY & HAPPINESS,
OR
If he so wishes, he may create all the "hell" (suffering and
misery) for himself, that he can enjoy and when he has had
enough, he has the POWER to turn about face, and begin
to build a Heaven (health, harmony and happiness) for
himself, when he has fully determined that he has had
enough of his own created Inferno.
Our thoughts and activities must respect the equal rights
of all human beings, in order to entitle us, as Individuals,
to the same respect from them.
Probably one of the greatest documents that has ever
emanated from the MIND of MAN, is the United States
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
ALL MEN ARE CREATED FREE AND EQUAL.
That all men are created free is a self-evident un-deniable
fact of life.
That they are born equal is NOT so self-evident, when no
two Individuals are found to be alike Intellectually or
Materially.
Natural Science, supported by the records of the accumu-
lated experiences of all humanity, throughout the recorded
history of mankind upon this planet, brings the following
self-evident facts to our attention and consideration:
All human beings that are born normally, possess Self-
Consciousness.
80
THINKING RELATED TO HEALTH
All human beings that are born normally, possess the Power
to Reason.
All human beings that are born normally, possess the Inde-
pendent Power of Choice.
All human beings that are born normally, possess the Self-
Conscious Rational Power of Freedom of Will.
It is in THIS SENSE that ALL MEN ARE CREATED
EQUAL. These are the God given TOOLS to all mankind,
with which each individual is enabled to build his life and
character.
How he USES these tools, is what presents to our Intelli-
gence the Infinite VARIATION of Individuality, which
blinds us to the Universal fact that at birth man is endowed
by Nature with the same Capital Stock.
WE ALL start out with the same working tools.
HOW, WHERE and WHEN we USE these tools deter-
mines the variations of experiences, which govern the
degree of development of the Individual Intelligence, as
well as the quality of our characters, which also determines
the degree and quality of our health, harmony, happiness.
It is the possession of these same powers and capacities, by
each and every human being at birth, that constitutes their
equality at birth.
How he uses these capacities and powers is what makes
him different from the rest of us (remembering the prin-
ciple of Evolution and the continuity of life after physical
death, which has been demonstrated by Natural Science
throughout the ages).
It is the development of man's thinking ability that de-
termines his evolutionary progress, awakens his moral
conscience, his sense of Right and Wrong, and arouses
his sense of Moral Responsibility and Personal Account-
ability for his thoughts and activities.
It is by his thoughts and actions, governed by Wisdom,
81
HARMONIOUS LIVING
that he successfully becomes Captain of his soul and Master
of his destiny.
The use of the term Soul is herein meant to be the govern-
ing Intelligent Entity, expressing itself through its
material bodies.
When the thoughts and activities of the Individual Intelli-
gence conform to the Constructive Principle in Individual
Life, it is fulfilling its obligations and duties to the Evolu-
tionary Principle of life and thereby making it possible for
nature to bring about the fulfillment of her plan for man's
HEALTH, HARMONY, HAPPINESS and the CONTIN-
UITY of his life.

82
THINKING RELATED TO HEALTH
For instance, a person may dig a hole in the ground,
and then fill it up and keep repeating the process.
Most things have a price value.
LABOR VALUE is the sum total of human effort,
mentally and physically.
LABOR VALUE is the true basis of exchange
value.
PRICE VALUE SHOULD REPRESENT LA-
BOR VALUE.
PRICE VALUE, LABOR VALUE and EX-
CHANGE VALUE should be equal to each other,
to satisfy the law of Equity, Justice and Right.
LIFE
CAN BE PROPERLY CONSIDERED
AS OUR BANK ACCOUNT WITH NATURE.
WHAT WE PUT INTO IT, that is WHAT WE
HAVE A RIGHT TO TAKE OUT.
WE MAY BORROW FROM THE
BANK OF LIFE,

IN CHEATING OURSELVES.

CHAPTER 9
The Mechanical and the Moral Laws,
As They Are Related To Man
The MECHANICAL LAWS of nature are the depart-
ment of Natural Law, which has to do with the forces and
activities of MATERIAL SUBSTANCE, and not with the
relations between Individual Human Intelligences.
The INVOLUNTARY PROCESSES of the material
bodies of man are subject to the Mechanical Laws govern-
ing matter.
The Moral law of nature has nothing to do with the forces
and activities below the level of Individualized human
Intelligence, in the sense of refinement.
The Intelligence of man is governed by the MORAL
ORDER of the Universe.
INTELLIGENCE is POSITIVE, MATTER is NEGA-
TIVE.
INTELLIGENCE is ACTIVE, MATTER is that which is
ACTED UPON.
INTELLIGENCE governs matter.
The Intelligence of man governs the voluntary processes
of his material bodies, which are subject to the jurisdiction
of the moral law.
Universal Intelligence governs the involuntary processes
of man's bodies through the Natural Laws of Mechanics,
which we shall now examine and make a study of.
85
THE MECHANICAL AND THE MORAL LAWS,
Every branch of Natural Science accepts the premise that
back of all life there is a CREATIVE POWER, a UNI-
VERSAL INTELLIGENCE or PRINCIPLE which cre-
ates and sustains all life and action.
Natural Science names this great principle and power
UNIVERSAL INTELLIGENCE.
Humanity generally expresses this same thought by the
use of the term GOD.
Physical Science uses the term POWER, and describes it
as potential, meaning the ability to act.
When POWER undergoes transformation it becomes
KINETIC, which means active. POWER as CAUSE,
KINETIC as EFFECT or the Law of CAUSE and EF-
FECT, ENERGY and MATTER.
Here, we evidence the birth of life's greatest mystery.
UNITY transforming itself into duality.
CAUSE generating EFFECT, or the origin of life and
action.
LIFE and ACTION expresses itself through a GREAT
UNIVERSAL DUALITY.
This Duality Natural Science defines as the great universal
principle of polarity or affinity.
86
CHAPTER 10
Polarity and the Evolution
Of Individual Intelligence
All LIFE AND ACTION expresses itself through-
a
GREAT UNIVERSAL DUALITY.
This Duality Natural Science defines as the great universal
principle of polarity or affinity.
To this great universal principle of polarity or affinity,
Natural Science traces all known life and action, and it
defines its mode of operation in the following terminology,
as a Universal Process.
There is a principle in nature which IMPELS every entity
to seek vibratory correspondence with another like entity
of opposite polarity. Through the operation of this great
universal principle, Nature has evolved the four physical
kingdoms. They are
:
The Mineral Kingdom
The Vegetable and Plant Kingdoms
The Animal Kingdom
The Human Kingdom.
Throughout the mineral kingdom of Individual life, the
principle of polarity or affinity expresses itself as positive
and negative polarity.
In the plant and animal kingdoms this dual principle is
known as male and female polarity.
Upon the human kingdom the principle of polarity is
87
HARMONIOUS LIVING
recognized as man and woman or masculine and feminine
polarity.
Natural Science defines the positive polarity of Intelligence
as the active, the creative, the generating force, the giving
and the teaching principle of Intelligence.
The negative or receptive principle of Intelligence as the
receiving, absorbing and reproductive force, the receiver or
pupil; Universal Intelligence as the original giver and
teacher; Individual Intelligence as the receiver and pupil.
This process of the birth, growth and development of the
Individualized Intelligence represents nature's process of
EVOLUTION.
EVOLUTION is the plan and mode of operation conducted
by Universal Intelligence, in the process of the Individual-
ization of Intelligence.
This process of evolution is discerned and traced by the
School of Natural Science in its gradual steps through the
mineral kingdom and as it manifests itself throughout the
plant and animal kingdoms and the human kingdoms.
This process of evolution becomes quite evident to a care-
ful observer by the increase of complexity of the Individual
organism in each kingdom of life, and particularly so by
awakening, growth and development of individualized
Consciousness, which has been concretely and poetically
described in the following terms:
CONSCIOUSNESS sleeps in the mineral kingdom, dreams
in the plant kingdom, awakens in the animal kingdom and
acts in man.
Unmeasured time and infinite degrees of gradual growth
and development in each kingdom, are implied in this con-
crete statement, before this principle of Evolution has
evolved a MAN, a self-conscious, rational, self-acting,
morally responsible unit of Intelligence.
Natural Science discovers something more than physical
matter in motion. It finds that a physical entity is some-
88
POLARITY AND INDIVIDUAL INTELLIGENCE
thing more than physical matter keyed to a certain rate of
vibratory action. It finds that all matter is alive, or rather
that matter is animated by something which we name either
magnetism, vitality or life.
It finds that a steel magnet exhibits a certain character of
vitality, a tree possesses yet another, the animal still an-
other, while it finds that man exhibits higher and more
subtle energies than anything below him.
The four Universal Life Elements successively give rise to
the four physical kingdoms, mineral, vegetable, animal and
human.
Each one of the life elements gives rise to a distinctive
form of physical activity or life. Each element governs a
kingdom which is entirely distinct in physical appearance,
in characteristics, capacities and activities.
The union of physical matter and the life elements is
brought about through and by the operation of that
principle which inheres in the universal life elements
themselves.
Each life element displays dual and yet differing powers
of positive and receptive energy.
In the union of physical matter with one or more of these
life elements, arise the phenomena of Magnetism, Vitality
and Life.
The Universal Life Elements are four in number:
The Electro-Magnetic life element
The Vito-Chemical life element
The Spiritual life element
The Soul life element.
One or more of these vital elements magnetizes, vivifies,
vitalizes or animates all physical matter, including the
mineral atom, the plant, the animal and man.
What we know as Magnetism in metals, Vitality in vegeta-
tion and Life in the animal and man are certain temporary
relations established between physical material and the finer
and more subtle elements.
89
HARMONIOUS LIVING
The range of phenomena included in the operation of these
elements, extends downwards to the unconscious mineral
atom and upward to the self-conscious soul.
The Electro-magnetic life element, the least potent of all
the vital elements, animates mineral substance and displays
the powers of Union, Cohesion and Aggregation.
The Vito-chemical life element, the next higher and more
potent of the universal life elements, vivifies vegetable
substance and governs a higher form of activity. This
element displays something more than the powers of union,
cohesion and aggregation. It does something more than
unite already existing particles. It possesses in addition
the powers of growth and organization. It generates new
forms by attracting the necessary material from the uni-
versal elements.
The Spiritual life element, a still higher and more potent
element generates a still higher form of life. Animal life
is a distinct advance upon vegetable life. Animal organisms
possess a vitality, capacity and power, wholly unlike and
superior to the plant. The animal cell exhibits the same
unconscious union, cohesion and aggregation of the mineral
atom. They also possess the power of growth and organiz-
ation as do the plants. The animal as a whole, possesses the
capacities which far transcends those of the mineral and
vegetable kingdoms. These capacities are defined as Indi-
vidual Consciousness, Sensation and Instinct and the power
of Volition.
The Soul life element, the highest and most subtle known
to science, involves the kingdom of man. In this fourth
and highest kingdom are found every capacity, characteris-
tic and possibility of all the lower kingdoms. Added to
these is a certain character of life, of energy and of capacity
never yet discovered in the lower kingdoms. In this king-
dom and in this alone are found Self-Consciousness, a Ra-
tional Intelligence, Morality, Altruism and a Free and
Independent Will and Desire.
90
POLARITY AND INDIVIDUAL INTELLIGENCE
Each one of the life elements dominates a particular king-
dom and gives rise to a distinctive class of phenomena.
These elements are unlike in essence, differing in character
and capacity. They are of different degrees of refinement
and therefore move at different rates of vibratory action.
The two lower life elements, the electro-magnetic and the
vito-chemical, have a physical as well as an etheral side.
These are the only two of the vital elements which move at
such a low rate of vibratory action, as to come within the
range of physical experiment.
Man, through his knowledge and control of these two
particular elements, revolutionizes, from time to time, the
established order of human society.
Electrical, medical and chemical sciences rest upon the
knowledge, control and a practical application of the elec-
tro-magnetic and vito-chemical forces in nature.
The Soul life element is the highest and most subtle ele-
ment which enters into the composition of man himself.
Water cannot rise above its own source when left to itself.
The Intelligent Soul has not risen to an Intelligent per-
ception of anything higher than his own highest element.
This is the element most difficult of analysis and demonstra-
tion. Study of this element and mastery of its principles,
constitutes the highest occupation of human Intelligence,
both physical and spiritual.
The proper study of mankind is MAN.
This was not intended simply as the study of man anatom-
ically or physiologically. He, who really studies man,
investigates and analyzes the capacities and powers of an
Intelligent soul. He does not merely dissect the physical
body nor analyze its physical functions.
The several distinct kingdoms of nature represent the union
of physical matter with the several life elements in nature.
These several kingdoms are seen to rise successively, as one
91
HARMONIOUS LIVING
after another, the life elements are inducted into physical
matter.
The vitalization of physical matter depends upon the ener-
gies which inhere in the universal life elements themselves.
The withdrawal of the life elements produces the same
results in each kingdom of nature, devitalization or death.
The material particles of any physical organism, divested
of the controlling life element, exercises a form of dis-
integration which we name decay or death.
When the electro-magnetic life element is extracted from
iron or steel, we have devitalized mineral substance or dead
ore. If a bottle of herb extract is left uncorked, the medi-
cine loses its potency or its life. When a man dies physical-
ly, it means that the more permanent MAN has withdrawn
from the physical counterpart. It means that the spiritual
organism still animated by the Individual Intelligence, sur-
vives that event, and goes on with existence under new
material conditions.
Physical matter is negative to and subject to the action of
the positive life elements. Physical life is nothing more
than the manifestation of a certain relation between the
animating life elements and coarser physical particles.
The supreme power of the soul life element is held to be
the power of persistence after physical death as an Indi-
vidual and self-conscious Intelligence. The soul life ele-
ment in its positive and receptive energies corresponds
with all the lower life elements of nature. Moved by the
same principle, the soul life element animates and inspires
humanity. It moves in lines of positive and receptive Intel-
ligence. The Intelligent Ego being essentially masculine
or feminine.
Distinct cleavage exists in the Intelligence as well as in
the physical and spiritual organisms of the human family.
Each higher kingdom includes all of the energies and func-
tions and powers of the lower life element.
92
POLARITY AND INDIVIDUAL INTELLIGENCE
A plant includes the energies and powers of electro-mag-
netism as well as those of the vito-chemical life. The
animal represents these same two elements, though gov-
erned by the spiritual life element.
Man combines the energies, functions and capacities of all
the elements, though he is governed by the highest, the
self-conscious soul.
The Universal life elements appear to have special offices
in the economy of nature. To the electro-magnetic is as-
signed the refinement of mineral substance and solidifying
of the planet.
The vito-chemical life element is given the task of prepar-
ing the planet for physical life. The particular office of
the spiritual life element appears to be the completion of
the physical body.
To an Intelligent soul is especially assigned the acquisition
of knowledge, the acquirement of power, the exercise of
Love and the attainment of happiness.
From the lowest to the highest, each element has performed
its task through the Sex principle of positive and negative
energy. Only by comparison is human intelligence able to
comprehend this supreme drama which is being enacted by
nature. Only by comparing a positive and a negative min-
eral atom with a man and a woman can the mind grasp the
meaning of the word EVOLUTION.
The evolution of each physical kingdom is the result of the
individual activities of entities which go to make up the
kingdom. The individual activity of the entity occasions
all magnetic change and chemical combination. It occasions
all growth, vegetable and animal. It governs the increase
of intelligence and the development of Reason, Morality
and Love.
Physical change and transmutation of matter are occa-
sioned by the Universal life elements rather than the
physical part of the individual entity. All the intelligent
93
HARMONIOUS LIVING
operations of the physical human individual are occasioned
by demands that inhere in the Soul. The struggle for nu-
trition, the struggle for reproduction and all other strug-
gles appearing to be physical are prompted by demands
which exist in a Soul.
One who studies the universal life elements back of all
physical matter discovers that all the operations of indi-
viduals in the lower kingdoms are Intelligent. All volun-
tary activities of animals are governed by Conscious
Intelligence resident in the spiritual life element.
The voluntary acts of men are directly referable to the
self-conscious Intelligence or Soul.
The Intelligent Ego operates both bodies in this physical
life and departs with the spiritual body at physical death.
Natural Science discovers vastly more than the fact that
there are principles, properties and elements, universal in
nature. It goes further than mere analysis of co-operation
as between these principles, properties and elements. It
goes further than mere demonstration of material processes
of evolution, whether these processes be physical or spirit-
ual. It declares that this world of ours is something more
than a world of physical matter.
Linnaeus concisely expressed these evolutionary steps in
nature, when he said stones grow, plants live and grow,
animals grow, live and feel.
Had he gone one step further and added, men grow, live,
feel and think, he would have expressed the Philosophy of
Individual Life.
Everything that is, atom, cell, organism, animal and human
is in a present state of refining, change and improvement.
The physical matter of one kingdom is being perpetually
refined for the use of another. The life of one kingdom is
continually preparing the way for a higher life of another
kingdom. The Intelligence of one kingdom is continually
aspiring to Intelligence of a higher order.
94
POLARITY AND INDIVIDUAL INTELLIGENCE
Considering the marvelous results achieved by physical
science through its knowledge of the least potent of the
vital elements, it is not difficult to conceive of the still
more wonderful results which would naturally flow from
a knowledge and control of all the life elements.
Study of the life elements in operation, is the study of the
universal principle of Polarity or Affinity. Through analy-
sis of these elements is demonstrated the fact that the
principle of polar attraction inheres in the vital elements
themselves and NOT in the solid particles of physical
matter.
Human affairs bear the impress of the soul life element and
must be measured and regulated and judged from the hu-
man kingdom.
A Man is more than an atom or a plant or an animal. He
is all these and more. He combines the elements and ener-
gies of all lower entities, but in addition enjoys the po-
tencies, powers and responsibilities of a distinctly higher
life element.

Elements That Promote Health
A CONSTRUCTIVE MENTAL ATTITUDE means the
desire and motive to be of Constructive service, and to live
ones life so as to be governed by the principle of Equity,
Justice and Right, in our relations with our fellowmen.
KINDNESS is an expression of sincere sympathy and
helpfulness.
GENEROSITY or ALTRUISM means a genuine regard
for the best interests of our fellows, accompanied by an
active, sincere desire to render to them Constructive and
beneficial service, without thought of or desire for, selfish
benefit or personal gain.
CHEERFULNESS represents a Consciousness of ones
discharge of their personal responsibility.
SYMPATHY is the feeling for and the expression of Har-
mony for our fellowmen.
OPTIMISM is the ability to rise above the worries of the
day.
TOLERANCE is the attitude of soul which recognizes and
appreciates the rights of others to think, act and believe as
their conscience and understanding dictates.
UN-SELFISHNESS is the attitude of soul which impels
one to render a full equivalent for every service received.
97
HARMONIOUS LIVING
HONESTY is the exemplification of truth in individual
life.
LOYALTY is the active, continuous and unwavering pur-
pose, intent and effort to discharge our personal responsi-
bility.
GRATITUDE is the appreciation of service received and
the desire, motive and intent to remunerate for that service.
FAITH is the soul's intuitive conviction of that which both
reason and conscience approve.
HOPE is the desire for and anticipation of, that which both
reason and conscience approve.
CHARITY is the intelligent discharge of personal respon-
sibility in service to others.
MODERATION IN ALL THINGS means the exercise of
our faculties, capacities and powers within constructive
limits.
The DESIRE TO EXEMPLIFY EQUITY, JUSTICE and
RIGHT in all our human relations with our fellowmen.
SELF-CONTROL
SELF-CONTROL is the constructive exercise and mastery
of all the voluntary powers of the soul, in their relation to
and action upon the faculties, capacities and vital energies
of the individual.
Self-control is the exercise of a governing, restraining,
guiding and directing influence over all the appetites,
passions, emotions and desires of the human entity.
Self-control is the conscious, intentional and voluntary
exercise of the power of Will, in restraint of the appetites,
passions, emotions, impulses and desires, which impel us
to action, in our individual search for satisfaction.
This means VOLUNTARY COMMAND OVER
ONE'S SELF.
SELF-CONTROL means that every appetite, every pas-
sion, every emotion, every desire, every impulse of a soul,
98
ELEMENTS THAT PROMOTE HEALTH
shall be so absolutely under control of the individual, that
he can in an instant and by a simple act of the Will, either
check it, suspend it, divert it or convert it into channels
of constructive activity.
This does NOT mean the suppression or elimination of a
single element, impulse, desire or function of individual
human nature, either physical, spiritual or psychical. It
means moderation in all things within constructive limits.
There is not a single impulse, emotion, passion or desire
of the human soul, whether they are classed as physical,
spiritual or psychica 1
, which, if it were permitted to control
the Intelligence, would become Destructive, but under
proper control of the Will, may be transmuted into a vital
impulse of Constructive energy and power.
When self-control awakens in a soul, unselfish compassion
for the sufferings of humanity, lifts that soul from weak-
ness to strength.
LOVE
LOVE is the supreme activity of the intelligent soul.
LOVE represents the harmonious relation between two
intelligent souls of opposite polarity.
LOVE is the instant and involuntary response of the indi-
vidual to the universal law of Harmonics, and leads to
perfect happiness in the marriage relation.
LOVE is but another name for the spirit of Altruism.
LOVE is an irresistible force that promotes health and
happiness.

CHAPTER 12
Effects of Disease Causes
Uncontrolled appetites, passions, emotions
and desires produce a weakening of the power of self-
control, and opens wide the doors of all the destructive
forces in nature.
FEAR is an emotion or activity of the soul, resulting from
the apprehension of danger, either real or imaginary. It is
an emotion which paralyzes the body and soul, and produces
nervous disorganization and disintegration.
Fear may be classified as psychological refrigeration or
the freezing of the soul.
It is a Destructive process. Fear varies in degree from
timidity and shyness or bashfulness to fright, dread and
horror.
WORRY is a slow-acting form of fear. It is a disintegrat-
ing and disorganizing destructive process and acts upon
the physical body as or similar to the activity of rust upon
iron.
ANGER in its extreme form or degree is intensely destruc-
tive in its psychological effects upon the individual who
harbors it. In its extreme forms it acts like a consuming fire
in a house of dry kindling wood. It destroys the house as
well as all it contains.
Its action is not only intensely destructive, but also very
101
HARMONIOUS LIVING
rapid. Sometimes it results in the most serious illness, al-
ways in great depletion and many times in instant death.
While its motive and intent is the destruction of others, it
inevitably destroys those who entertain it.
ANGER varies in degree, from a small kindling fire to a
raging furnace or prairie fire. It destroys the human body
and the Intelligence that resides within it.
It expresses itself in mildest forms as impatience, irrita-
tion, resentment, annoyance and displeasure to its extreme
form of hatred, revenge, wrath, fury and rage. It could be
described as psychological combustion.
LUST is an excessive indulgence or the desire to indulge.
It is destructive in its effects because it undermines the
very foundation of health and freedom. It weakens self-
control and the freedom of the power of the Will, and opens
the doors to outside Mental Control; to some form of
Hypnotism or Mediumship, which constitute the most
Destructive Force upon the Individual Intelligence that
exists in all the forces and processes in nature, because it
deprives the Individual Intelligence of its Power of Will,
and he becomes an abject slave, under the control of the
hypnotist.
GREED is the inordinate and insatiable thirst for material
possessions, regardless of the merit or the earning capacity
of the greedy one. It grows out of our misunderstanding
as to our just deserts under Natural law, and is a miscon-
ception of the real meaning of the term possession. It is
aggressive and compelling in its nature and activity.
SELF-PITY is an emotion, and an indulgence of the imag-
ination. It is weak, introspective, psychological consump-
tion. It is the most unfortunate weakness to which human
nature is subject.
It is based upon the assumption that the world or nature
has dealt with us unjustly, that we rightly and justly de-
serve vastly more than we now possess, without the slight-
102
EFFECTS OF DISEASE CAUSES
est attempt on our part to justify such an assumption by the
schedule of desserts on the one hand and possession on the
other, and jump to the conclusion that the ledger of life
shows a large balance due us, which has never been paid.
Self-pity softens and weakens and lets down the barriers
to all deadly psychological microbes. In a psychic sense it
manifests all the evidence of a self consuming process.
SELFISHNESS is the attitude of soul which impels one
to receive more freely than he is willing to give.
There is something in the spirit of selfishness that chains
the Intelligence to earthly conditions. The man whose
attitude of soul impels him to strive for the advantage in
every exchange, the kind of selfishness that impels an
individual to take an unfair advantage of another, to receive
that for which he is unwilling to render a just equivalent,
or to withhold from another, that which he knows to be
his just due, acts upon the soul in a manner, somewhat akin
to the action of opium upon the physical nervous organism.
SELF-INDULGENCE is a weakness of human nature that
touches every element and phase of individual character.
It has reference to the indulgence of the propensities,
appetites, passions and desires.
The appetites, passions, emotions and desires are natural
functions and are therefore, not only legitimate and proper,
but they are necessary and should be respected.
But the man or woman who becomes a "slave" to them, to
the exclusion of the care and health of the soul, soon sinks
to the level of morality below that of the animal.
Self-indulgence extends to every department of human
nature, the soul as well as the body. It is as easy for some
men to indulge the tendency of impatience or irritability
or other phases of anger, as it is for others to indulge in
the physical appetites and passions, the one is just as
destructive as the other.
There are perhaps as many women who indulge themselves
103

in the habit of anxiety, despondency, suspicion, and dread,
as there are who fall victims of their grosser natures.
Humiliating as the fact must be to every honest Intelli-
gence, it is nevertheless true that bright and intelligent
men have labored long and determinedly to formulate and
promulgate philosophies and religions that will justify
them in the indulgence of all the baser impulses and de-
sires of gross human nature.
Every Individual who has arrived at the age of discretion,
knows how broad and smooth and seductive is the road that
leads to self-surrender, self-indulgence, self-destruction.
SELF-INDULGENCE is PSYCHOLOGICAL SUICIDE.
VANITY in all its forms and phases is an expression of
the most inordinate selfishness, and is therefore Destructive.
There are two kinds of vanity; vanity of person and vanity
of intelligence.
Personal Vanity is self admiration of personal appearance.
It stimulates in us the craving and desires for the admira-
tion and the applause of others, as to our personal appear-
ance.
Intellectual Vanity is unjustifiable admiration of ones in-
telligence or intellectual attainments.
Vanity expresses itself in many forms and phases ; self-
esteem, self-praise, self-love, egotism, arrogance, arbitrari-
ness and dogmatism represent a few of its many forms.
Vanity is an impulse of self-gratification, without regard
of any kind whatsoever for the well being of others. Vanity
in whatever form or phase it may express itself, is the
essence of selfishness. It is PSYCHOLOGICAL POISON.
EGOTISM is unjustifiable admiration of ones own intel-
ligence or intellectual attainments. It impels one to seek
the admiration and applause of others, as to our intellectual
brilliancy, wit, humor, knowledge, judgment and intellec-
tual superiority over others.
104
EFFECTS OF DISEASE CAUSES
Egotism is one of man's most conspicuous faults, and a
glaring defect of character. Vanity of person is a weakness
more common to women.
The ambition for power, so common among men, is im-
pelled by their desire for public applause.
The struggle for leadership, political and social, is but a
struggle that is impelled by egotism. The impulse back of
it all, is the love of approbation and the desire for admira-
tion and public applause.
There is perhaps no single trait of human character, which
more clearly betrays the charlatan and the faker, than that
form of egotism which impels men to the struggle for
leadership and power.
INTOLERANCE is the attitude of soul which does not
recognize nor appreciate the rights of others to think, act
and believe as their conscience and understanding dictates.
It is a form of vanity and is Destructive in its effect upon
the individual who harbors it.
HABIT is the result of the repetition of an indulgence,
until the desire for the indulgence overcomes the desire
to withstand it and the individual becomes a victim of his
indulgence.
Anything in life which destroys WILL and controls the
Individual is Destructive in its effect upon the individual.
There are no GOOD habits. Why? Because Habit has a
tendency to become AUTOMATIC; that is, a tendency to
act WITHOUT OUR OWN IMPULSE TO INITIATE
THE ACT; in other words, it develops a tendency to act,
without ourselves CONTROLLING THE ACT,
THROUGH THE CONSCIOUS KNOWING and IN-
TENTIONAL EXERCISE and USE of our WILL
POWER TO GENERATE THE IMPULSE THAT PRO-
DUCES THE ACT.
HABIT, therefore, weakens our own Will Power, in the
control and direction of our activities, and makes it pos-
105
HARMONIOUS LIVING
sible for outside control to step in and thereby deprive us
of our individual control and directive power over our
thoughts and actions. To the degree that this takes place,
to that degree we become irresponsible for our thoughts
and actions, and to that degree we become automotons,
governed by forces "outside" of our own selves.
It may be our environment or it may be any strong
WILLED human being, who desires to assume control over
our Will Power and DICTATE OUR ACTIONS accord-
ing to that Individual's WISH AND DESIRE.
Once that Individual obtains "full control" of our Will
Power, we are at the mercy of his desires, regardless of
what they may be, because we are then compelled to obey
his every thought or impulse he directs to us, to the extent
of our strength and ability to execute his thoughts and
desires, even to the extent of committing a murder, if that
should be his real desire and impulse.
Once our Will Power is under the control of another hu-
man being, that human being can force us to do anything
that we are able to do ourselves, when we had control of our
own Will Power, and even more; that is, we can be forced
to do anything that was within the bounds of our own
abilities "plus" the added ability of the controlling Indi-
vidual's power, and thus accomplish results (good or evil)
that we ourselves were unable to do in our "normal" con-
dition.
Habit as it progresses from its initial origin, gradually
undermines our own self-control and opens the door wide
for "outside control" to dictate and control our lives, and
we thereby become an automatic instrument of "outside
forces" to the degree that we lose our own power of self-
control.
Some Habits appear harmless in their early stages, but
without exception, they gradually undermine our power of
self-control, until we finally become helpless victims and
absolute slaves of our habits, if we permit that state of
106
EFFECTS OF DISEASE CAUSES
condition to develop. This process develops so quietly and
stealthily that we are not consciously aware of it, until we
awaken to discover that we have reached a point, where
and when we cannot stop without a strenuous and supreme
struggle for our very lives, as it were, or die in the attempt.
It is then truly a case of "Give me Liberty or Give me
Death", for life is not worthwhile, once we become a help-
less slave to the vicious and degenerate of the human
family.
This becomes truly and literally a "Living Hell", day and
night, without any possibility of relief, except that we
earnestly desire and pray for help, with the resolute
hope and faith in the honesty, sincerity and determination
of our purpose and intent to EARN THAT HELP, by
doing all within our power in the future to guard that
precious GIFT of self-control with our very lives; that we
shall never again knowingly and willingly and intention-
ally permit outside forces to deprive us of that priceless
God-given right of SELF-CONTROL.
No human being can deprive another human being of his
power of self-control without their consent and willing
co-operation.
This FACT should be INDELIBLY RECORDED within
the memory of every human being.
It is a GIFT from the Great Universal Intelligence, for our
own SUPREME USE and DIRECTIVE POWER and
WE and WE ALONE as individual beings have the
MORAL RIGHT to possess and use it.
This at the same time gives us the ability to mis-use it, by
permitting it to be taken from us and as a result, we find
ourselves, usually, in an Institution for the Insane.
Alcoholic Beverages and the use of tobacco may easily be-
come habitual.
Their use can be kept within Constructive Limits but they
are dangerous experiments, and unless the user is aware of
107
HARMONIOUS LIVING
the danger and able to keep the usage within the limits of
their food values, which represents a very narrow sphere,
it is safest to refrain from its use, and substitute other
foods that do not possess the same dangers. There are
other foods that contain the same food value, without
possessing the harmful contents.
People living in a very cold climate and possessing heavy
coarse bodies, doing heavy work and subject to the ex-
posure of cold temperature, may use alcoholic liquors in
small amounts, with or after meals and derive constructive
benefits from its use. Under such circumstances, it aids
digestion and generates needed heat energy, but for the
people living in moderate climates, and where heavy work
is performed largely by machinery, there is no Constructive
need or benefit to be derived by the use of alcoholic bev-
erages.
In fact, in most cases, with very few exceptions, alcoholic
beverages are injurious, habit forming and dangerous.
Especially is this so with refined and Intelligent individu-
als. They are injured to a greater degree and its effects
spread much more rapidly (thin paper tears more easily
than heavy coarse paper).
The use of tobacco has much less justification, if it has any
at all, so far as food value is concerned, neither can it be
justified from a Health standpoint. It acts as a mild sopori-
fic, it has a mild hypnotic effect upon the nerves, lulling
them into inactivity or sleep.
It is habit forming and in due time, unless it is controlled
and its effects counteracted, one soon finds himself an ab-
ject slave to a tyrannical habit, and experiences a weakening
and undermining of the Power of Will, which opens the
doors to all manner of destructive forces and activities,
depending of course, upon the degree of usage.
Coffee and narcotics are habit forming and are destructive
to the degree that they are used excessively. There is little
108
EFFECTS OF DISEASE CAUSES
if anything to be gained by the use of narcotics and much
to lose.
The Wisest way is to abstain from all harmful habit form-
ing usages. Many drugs in use are habit forming and
therefore Destructive. All the medicines that are required
for the establishment and maintenance of Health, can be
obtained from the various kinds of foods and they are
abundantly available and beneficial.
109
CHAPTER 13
The Sex Principle
The NORMAL AND MORAL function of the physical
sex nature is twofold.
(1) It is the normal channel for the reproductive process
and the perpetuation of the human race.
(2) When marriage is successful, the sex function tends
to harmonize the bodies of the companions in marriage and
under Ideal conditions in due time the couple look like
brother and sister. Many of us have seen evidence of this
fact and it is to be hoped that such evidence will become
more abundant as the underlying principle becomes better
known.
Abuse or the mis-use of the physical sex function is a
violation of natural law and produces serious Destructive
results.
Physical dis-ease and deformity, and mental and moral
degeneracy are evidence of man's ability to defy and oppose
nature's sublime law of polarity or affinity.
Monogamy accompanies the highest known development in
human society. Monogamy protects the interests of the
child and the race. Monogamy characterizes the highest
civilizations, and is best for all the human race.
When wives and husbands have ceased to respect and love
each other, they should abstain from all intimate relations,
and cheerfully preserve the legal form of marriage, so long
110
THE SEX PRINCIPLE
as the mutual obligations to their own children demand
such denial.
The evolution of marriage up to our present system of
monogamy represents the growth and develoment of the
Individual Intelligence to a rational and moral understand-
ing of the true and normal relationship for man and
woman.
Such a marriage system demonstrates man's recognition
and acceptance of the fact of superiority over the animal
nature, as well as recognition of his personal responsibility
to the moral law governing his life.
No man and no woman normally balanced, mentally and
morally, could condemn monogamy in its principle. Not
even the prostitute or libertine would deny its necessity
to the development of government, society & the home.
Prostitution and Polygamy represent the search for a har-
monic union, and the effort to fulfill it. They represent the
ignorant efforts of the undeveloped, the gross and the
vicious, for self-satisfaction and self-adjustment. They are
practices which may be called experimental rather than
un-natural. They are the negative means of education.
They teach man through experience, that he does not find
permanent satisfaction in such relations.
Impurities that accumulate within the physical body, as a
result of the violation of the sex function are normally
eliminated from the body, just as other accumulation of
impurities are removed in the most practical manner if not
suppressed by erroneous treatment. Nature's process of re-
moving these impurities should be allowed to take its norm-
al course, and nature will re-establish normal conditions.
This phase of sex dis-ease may be described as the func-
tional form of this sex abnormality.
But if this process of elimination is stopped by the use of
dangerous inorganic minerals, in the mistaken attempt to
cure the condition and the impurities are forced back into
ill
HARMONIOUS LIVING
the body or prevented from being eliminated, with the
additional inorganic minerals that were used, the combined
destructive forces soon produce a chronic and a constitu-
tional or general condition in the body, while the functional
process of elimination is localized.
The functional elimination under natural direction is cura-
tive, while the suppression of nature's purification process,
plus the mineral-poisons, gradually spread through the
entire body and produce the condition generally named
syphilis.
Syphilis, like all other dis-eased conditions, may be per-
manently removed. That is cured, in due time, by the
regular methods of curing all dis-eased conditions.
(1st) by the removal of the cause or causes by the indi-
vidual involved.
(2nd) by co-operation with nature's CONSTRUCTIVE
PROCESS OF ELIMINATION and Purification, the
mechanics of which will be dealt with in another chapter.

Menstruation,
Child-Birth, & Menopause
EVERY HUMAN BEING IS Captain of his or her soul
and Master of his or her Destiny. When womankind learns
to live a constructive or harmonious life these three steps,
which represent three links in nature's chain of Evolution
whose function it is to perpetuate human life upon this
physical plane, will become as harmonious, pleasurable and
beneficial as every other normal process in the Evolution
of Individual Intelligence.
All the sufferings of womankind, like the sufferings of the
masculine element of the race, would seem to represent
the negative process of learning the wrong way, WHAT
NOT TO DO, if we desire HEALTH, HARMONY and
HAPPINESS.
Nature's constructive laws are the blue prints, the compass,
the sign posts along the pathway of evolution, which point
to the human privilege of developing human growth, hu-
man health and human happiness, and the maintenance of
the continuity of existence, as normal, healthy and happy
individualized human beings.
113
CHAPTER 15
Disease
of
Eyes and Ears
IN A GENERAL SENSE, dis-ease may be classified as
functional and organic. Functional dis-ease represents an
interference with the normal processes of a part or parts of
the body, caused by an accumulation of impurities in those
parts or throughout the entire body.
Organic disease represents an advanced stage of functional
disease wherein the organic part or parts are broken down
or disorganized.
This process may be REVERSED if it is not too far ad-
vanced, by the CONSTRUCTIVE PROCESS OF THINK-
ING AND APPLICATION, the methods and details of
which are described in later chapters.
Functional dis-ease of the eyes or ears are strongly affected
by the general condition of the body, improving with a
general improvement of the body and conversely being
weakened by the accumulation of impurities, depending
upon the degree of the accumulation.
Eye glasses and ear aids may be discarded, if and when
the general condition of the body is improved sufficiently.
In cases of organic disease, if not too far advanced in des-
truction and if it secures proper treatment, it will eventual-
ly be re-built to a normal status and function, but will
naturally require much longer time.
The details of proper treatment are in a later chapter.

CHAPTER 16
Hypnotism and Mediumship
SOME OF THE TERMS used in this chapter as they are
denned by Natural-Science.
HYPNOTIST, a person in the physical body who volun-
tarily controls the Will, voluntary powers and sensory
organism of another physically embodied person.
SUBJECT, a physically embodied person, whose Will,
voluntary powers and sensory organism are under the dom-
ination and subject to the control of a hypnotist.
SPIRITUAL CONTROL, a spiritually embodied person,
who voluntarily controls the Will, voluntary powers and
sensory organism of a person in the physical body.
MEDIUM, a physically embodied person, whose Will,
voluntary powers and sensory organism are subject to the
Will and domination of a spiritual control.
HYPNOTISM, the process by and through which a hypno-
tist obtains, holds and exercises control of the Will, volun-
tary powers and sensory organism of his subject. Also the
psychic relation which exists between the two parties, dur-
ing the continuance of the hypnotic process.
MEDIUMSHIP, the process by and through which a spirit-
ual control obtains, holds and exercises control of the Will,
voluntary powers and sensory organism of a medium. Also
the relation which exists between the two Intelligences,
during the mediumistic process.
115
HARMONIOUS LIVING
SPIRITUAL ORGANISM, the spiritual body of an indi-
vidual, with all its various organs and organic parts, by
and through which the Intelligent soul manifests itself
upon the spiritual planes of life.
SOUL, the Intelligent Ego, entity or essential being, which
inhabits and operates both the physical body and the spirit-
ual body and manifests itself through them.
HYPNOTISM, briefly defined, is the process by and
through which a hypnotist obtains, holds and exercises
control of the Will, voluntary powers and sensory organ-
ism of his subject. And only in so far as such control
exists is the process hypnotic.
To understand the process involved, it is necessary to
understand how man functions through and controls his
physical body. Let us see if we can obtain a clear picture
of how this takes place.
Man's physical body is an electro-magnetic dynamo. Every
atom, every cell, every organ and the body as a whole, all
are generators of electro-magnetism. Electro-magnetism,
that is electricity and magnetism, are inseparable, they al-
ways function together. Wherever electricity flows, it is
surrounded by a magnetic field. It acts as an insulator for
the electric current. Electricity flows in straight lines, and
magnetism surrounds the current. This constitutes a mag-
netic field.
Man's physical body is saturated with and surrounded with
magnetism. The magnetic field that surrounds the physical
body of man constitutes NATURE'S PROTECTION for
each and every normal human being, from external penetra-
tion and control by any other human being.
The magnetism of man's physical body is under the con-
trol of his power of Will. Man's Will controls the mag-
netic forces of his body. The magnetic forces control the
activities of the nerves. The nerves control the action of
the muscles. The muscles control the movement of the
116
HYPNOTISM AND MEDIUMSHIP
bones, and in this manner, man controls the movement of
his body, by controlling the magnetism with his power of
Will.
In so long as man maintains a POSITIVE and FEAR-
LESS mental attitude, it is impossible for a hypnotist to
hypnotize such a human being.
BUT it is possible for any human being to destroy his
own natural protection by permitting himself to drift
into NEGATIVE thinking and activities, which has the
effect of lowering the vitality (magnetism) of the physical
body.
It is this Vitality that constitutes the protective magnetic
held that surrounds and shields every human being, from
external mental domination.
This magnetic field must be negatized before it can be
penetrated by the Will Power of any other human being.
When both the mind and body become negative, it consti-
tutes an open-invitation for hypnotic domination and con-
trol.
HYPNOTISM is one of the MOST DESTRUCTIVE
FORCES in the life of man.
There are all shades and degrees of hypnosis, ranging
from the lightest form of hypnotic influence, through all
the deepening stages, to the most profound state of com-
plete functional suspension of the physical organism.
In the incipient stages, the subject seems to be almost
entirely conscious of all that is transpiring about him on
the physical plane, but as the state is intensified, he gradu-
ally loses control of his independent faculties and capaci-
ties as well as his voluntary powers, and his impressions
from the outside physical world about him.
In the deeper state of complete lethargy or catalepsy, his
consciousness is wholly out of touch with the physical
sensory organism.
117
HARMONIOUS LIVING
In this condition he becomes an automatic instrument under
the control of the operator's Will. Under this condition, he
(the hypnotic subject) sees, hears, tastes, smells and feels
what the operator says he sees, hears, tastes, smells and feels
and nothing else. For the time being his Individuality is
surrendered to the person who has hypnotized him.
The impulses of the operator's Will are as much a fact to
him, in this condition of complete subjectivity, as are the
objects of nature, which impress the physical sensory
organism, in his natural waking condition.
Every thought of the operator, every impulse of his Will
is a thing which is impressed upon the subject's Conscious-
ness, as definitely as are the tangible subjects of nature,
under other conditions.
Its integrity is no more a matter of doubt to him in this
state, than is the sight of any physical object with his
physical eyes in his normal waking condition.
In this state and condition here referred to, the Mind and
Will of the hypnotist takes the place of the physical world
in their relation to the Consciousness of the subject.
They constitute the only world with which the subject, for
the time being, is in Conscious touch, during the continu-
ance of this relation.
His Mind and Will are the sole governing factors in the
Conscious life of the subject.
The only impulse the subject has for "good or evil", while
in this state, are those which come to him from the Will
of the hypnotist.
He can no more disobey the Will of the operator during
this relation, than he can disobey his own Will, in his norm-
al condition.
Methods of "curing" this condition are described in a later
chapter.
118
CHAPTER 17
Curing
Hypnotism Or Mediumship
What Is Involved?
Hypnotism or mediumship means the loss of
the ABILITY, by the subject or medium, to exercise CON-
TROL of his own POWER of WILL, over the voluntary
functions and activities of his own physical body, to the
degree that the loss of control exists at any given time.
To establish a "cure" for this condition would necessarily
mean REVERSING the PROCESS of the LOSS of SELF-
CONTROL by REGAINING and REBUILDING that
SELF-CONTROL.
To accomplish this result, it is necessary to educate the
Individual in the use and exercise of his own intelligence,
so that he may guard and protect himself in such manner
and to such extent, that he shall never again become so
willingly negative, receptive and subjective, as to surrender
his own SELF-CONTROL, and YIELD HIMSELF to the
hypnotic control of any other Individual, whom-so-ever.
He must learn to THINK courageously, constructively,
self-confidently, with self-assurance and with self-assertion,
and
It is absolutely necessary to AVOID FEAR thoughts, and
negative thinking,
and
ACT ONLY upon thoughts that are kind, generous, optim-
119
HARMONIOUS LIVING
istic and self-confident and courageous in their character.
The Individual should keep in mind the FACT that God
or Nature endowed every human being with the POWER
of SELF-CONTROL OVER HIS OWN BODY and that
power must be FORCIBLY TAKEN, if it is taken at all.
IT BELONGS to each Individual by Divine Right, and
therefore he has a moral right to take back that of which
he was wrongfully deprived.
Each human being's power of self-control is "protected by
nature" and that protection must be broken down and over-
come, before any other human being can penetrate that
protection. A hypnotist must use superior force, to be able
to take possession of the Will power, that by divine right
belongs to the Individual from whom it is being FORCIB-
LY T/VKEN.
A self-confident, positive and self-assertive STATE OF
MIND must be cultivated. As soon as this is accomplished,
that fact within itself DESTROYS the ability of an outside
Control to continue to maintain that control.
And to assist in the acquirement of that mental attitude,
there are a number of "mechanical aides" that can help
greatly in regaining and re-building this desired result of
re-establishing the control of their own Will power, of
which they were forcibly deprived.
These mechanical aides help and protect the Individual, in
the exercise of his mental forces, to obtain the return of
his power of Will, which is rightly his own.
Some of the mechanical means are as follows:
Continuous ACTIVITY and SELF-ASSERTION during
wakeful hours. Keep in the SUNLIGHT as much as pos-
sible.
AVOID INACTIVITY as much as possible, the more self-
assertion the better. Keep in mind the fact, that when YOU
USE YOUR BODY, you exercise YOUR OWN CON-
120
CURING HYPNOTISM OR MEDIUMSHIP
TROL of your own Will power, thereby strengthening it,
and at the same time weakening power of outside control.
Walking is good exercise, when other means of activity is
not available. AVOID DARKNESS as much as possible. It
is advisable to sleep with a light in the room and an open
window for fresh air. Normal deep breathing is helpful.
Cold water applications are very helpful, as enumerated
below; Cold water showers, cold packs, at night while
sleeping, and at other times when required. Cold water
sponges, and cold water "sitz baths" which act as powerful
stimulants to the activity of the bowels, as well as invigor-
ating the kidneys.
SUN BATHING is very helpful. It vitalizes the body as a
whole, and by taking frequent cold showers or coldsponges
and permitting the water to "evaporate" from the body, that
keeps the body cool in the hot sun for a long time. Renew
the cold water applications when the body gets too warm.
The patient should go on a raw meat diet, just as soon as
the system will adapt itself to the change, beginning with
an eighth of a pound of carefully stripped round steak,
finely ground. Increase the amount to half a pound three
times daily. To make it palatable, season it with salt and
pepper or mustard and spread it between the slices of whole
wheat bread.
And to this add all the rich fresh milk the patient can be
induced to drink.
Enough raw vegetables, lettuce, onions, cucumbers and cab-
bage may be added to keep elimination normal.
Avoid all the more negative foods, especially vegetables
such as rice, cooked cereals, nuts, etc., until sanity has
been restored.
No matter how violent the patient may become, never ad-
minister sedatives, nor narcotics for the purpose of quieting
him or giving him rest or sleep.
Instead of placing him in a dark room, take him into the
121
HARMONIOUS LIVING
brightest sunlight and if necessary, tie him where he will
be upon the ground and in the sunlight. Keep him there
until his paroxysms have passed and he has slept.
Do not use the warm or hot bath for relaxing the nervous
organism of such patients. For cleansing purposes alone,
the hot or warm bath may be used, but never for longer
than about two minutes. This should in all cases be fol-
lowed immediately by a cold shower or sponge bath, with
hard rub with rough towel, until every vestige of the
loosened skin has been removed.
The very first step in the treatment of such a patient, is
to empty the bowels as completely as possible. This can
be best and most thoroughly accomplished by the high-
enema, using one quart of water to a quart and a half, at a
time. This should be repeated every day, for the first week,
and often enough thereafter to keep the entire colon
flushed and clean. The temperature of the water should be
about 95° and before its expulsion the bowels should be
thoroughly massaged, to break up any and all accumulations
of effete matter in the colon. Each full warm enema should
be followed immediately by a cool (not cold) enema of at
least one quart of water.
Do not use physics or cathartics under any circumstances.
From a strictly medicinal angle, give the patient a strong,
positive tonic, to build up his physical vitality and strength
to the highest point possible. Keep up this tonic treatment
steadily. A fine combination for this is the very best brand
of beef, iron and wine tonic to be had.
122
CHAPTER 18
Insanity
Organic and Subjective
INSANITY, MENTAL UNSOUNDNESS or Derangement
of the Mind.
Organic Insanity is usually accompanied by a physical
injury or disability, causing derangement of the brain so
that it does not function normally; and as a result, the
imagination is so stimulated to activity, that it is unable
to differentiate between the pictures of imagination im-
pressed upon Consciousness and the impressions made by
living realities, and are therefore classified as illusory and
as a hallucination and requires treatment that will restore
the normal function of the brain, if that is possible.
Organic insanity, therefore, requires the re-establishment
of the normal structure and function of the brain, where
and when it is a physical possibility, within the knowledge
of the physician and the co-operation of the patient.
Subjective "so called" Insanity is in reality NOT insanity.
The condition is caused by HYPNOTIC CONTROL.
When the hypnotic control is removed or broken, the Indi-
vidual is able to function as normally as ever.
The "cure" of subjective or so-called delusional insanity,
which is brought about by hypnotic control, is in the ac-
quirement by the patient of the original self-control over
his or her own Will power, and re-establish the normal
status.

Paralysis
PARALYSIS MAY BE PRODUCED by a large variety
of causes. Anything that will prevent the How of vitality
to any part or parts results in the condition we name
Paralysis.
FEAR is capable of producing partial or even total paraly-
sis, in extreme cases.
When impurities accumulate in any part of the body in
sufficient quantities, it has the effect of "short-circuiting"
the electro-magnetic current flowing through the "nerve
system" of that part. It stops the flowing of vitality or
the life element to the part, as a result of which paralysis
or the inability to function takes place. All voluntary
activity in the physical body takes place as a result of the
electro-magnetic life element's action upon the nervous
system of the body.

Digestion and Assimilation
DiGESTION IS THE PROCESS of breaking down, dis-
organizing and separating into their atomic and molecular
component parts, the substance used as food in the physical
body, after which it enters the blood stream and is carried
to every part of the body, as nutriment.
ASSIMILATION is the process carried on by the life
elements within the physical body, in the rebuilding, re-
newing and sustaining of every cell of the bodily structure,
by absorbing from the blood stream, the necessary elements
with which to combine and re-combine them, so as to pro-
duce the required structure for each and every cell and
part, wherever and whenever needed.
Just as the printer is able to combine and recombine any
word, thought, idea or chain of ideas, from the alphabetical
letters at his command.

CHAPTER 21
Birth and Death
Birth not the beginning; death not the
END.
Life is an endless chain of links within the process of
EVOLUTION. Natural Science, or rather the members of
the School of Natural Science, through their text books on
Natural Science, state that they have demonstrated beyond
the shadow of a doubt, that INTELLIGENCE, like Energy
and Matter, is INDESTRUCTIBLE, and that the change
life undergoes in the process we name "death", represents
merely a change of instruments and location of operation
of the Individual Intelligence.
That Birth and Death succeed each other, that is, birth
here in the physical body was preceded by "death" at the
previous point of operation, and that "death" of the physic-
al body here, is instantaneously followed by birth, at the
next point of operation, the location of which is determined
by the development of the Individual Intelligence at the
time of departure.
The only condition that really disappears is the "form".
The matter contained in the "form" of the physical body
is transmuted back into chemical co-operation with the
earth, as well as the energy of the physical matter contained
in the physical body.
The Intelligence governing the physical body, gravitates
127
HARMONIOUS LIVING
to its own sphere of development, where it continues to
function, through its Spiritual body, in its fresh environ-
ment, in accordance with its own desires and aspirations,
as it did upon the physical plane.
128
CHAPTER 22
Development of Disease
DiSEASE IN ITS ESSENTIAL nature is DISCORD.
When a human being violates a law of life it produces Dis-
cord within the physical body.
This discord disintegrates some of the bodily tissue.
This disintegrated tissue of the physical body enters the
blood stream and is removed through the regular organs
of elimination. The three major ones are the bowels, the
kidneys and the lungs.
The bowels remove the solids and semi-solids. The kidneys
remove the liquids and solids held in solution. The lungs
transmute substance into gases and eliminate them in that
form.
The entire skin surface of the body, when in normal condi-
tion, acts as a supplementary aid in the process of elimina-
tion, in helping to maintain the purity of the blood stream
and the harmony and normal functioning of the body.
In its early stages, dis-ease conditions develop very slowly,
quietly and gradually, entirely unknown to the individual
involved. When the governing Intelligence begins to in-
crease and speed up the errors and violations of the laws
governing life and health, the blood stream then becomes
heavily laden with impurities, and a point is soon reached
when the regular organs of elimination become OVER-
WORKED and unable to remove the impurities as rapidly
as they are produced, with the consequent result, that they
129
HARMONIOUS LIVING
remove as much of the impurities as the vitality of the body
will permit, the balance remaining within the body.
Gradually this balance increases in volume until the blood
stream becomes saturated with these impurities.
This represents the origin of Constipation and the birth
of dis-ease.
This is the first positive evidence the Individual has of the
accumulation, development and growth of dis-eased condi-
tions within the body, which are a sequel to the "warnings"
of the "internal guides" during the daily activities of living.
When the accumulation of impurities increase beyond the
saturation point, an important CHANGE takes place.
When the blood stream becomes over-loaded, that is, when
it contains more substance in solution than it can carry in
circulation, the SURPLUS is DEPOSITED in various
parts of the body.
These impurities begin to produce discord in the parts
where they have been deposited.
When these impurities have been deposited within the
region of the bronchial tubes, the condition is described as
"bronchitis". If the impurities are deposited within the
region of the tonsils, the resulting condition is named
"tonsilitis". When these impurities locate in the joints of
the bones or around the muscular tissue, it is classified as
"rheumatism". When the impurities assemble around the
nerve lines, we name it "neuritis".
When the nerve lines become sufficiently saturated with
impurities, it has the effect of "short-circuiting" the cur-
rents of electro-magnetism flowing through, which results
in a state or condition we name temporary paralysis, in
whatever locality this takes place. This condition may
gradually spread to various parts of the body and eventual-
ly to the entire body. It is then described as total paralysis.
When the impurities accumulate in the lungs in sufficient
130
DEVELOPMENT OF DISEASE
quantities to begin to disorganize the lung structure, we
name that condition "consumption"; and so on ad infinitum.
We give different names to dis-ease, according to where
these impurities are deposited within the physical body.
In reality and in truth, there is but ONE dis-ease: IM-
PURITIES accumulating within the body faster than the
body can eliminate them (caused by violation of nature's
laws).
The degree of the accumulation of these impurities and
the variations of their location has given rise to an ap-
parently endless list of dis-eases, and we find ourselves
within a house of mirrors, with a loss of our sense of direc-
tion for a way out, either as to the cause of dis-ease or its
cure.
Because we have concentrated our attention upon EF-
FECTS with the idea of REMOVING or DESTROYING
those effects by every conceivable possible means, in place
of searching for the cause and its removal.
This TRUTH is as self-evident as the fact that one and
one is two.
The plain FACT is, there is but ONE dis-ease: the accum-
ulation of impurities within the body, beyond the vitality
of the body to remove them, caused by violation of nature's
laws governing life.
The degree of existing dis-ease, varies with the degree
of the accumulation of these impurities within the physical
body.
And logically enough and self-evidently, there is and can
be but one PERMANENT and SURE CURE,
THE REMOVAL OF THE CAUSE.
And nature will slowly and gradually but surely CLEAN
HOUSE, and remove the results of our mistakes, when we
have removed the cause or causes of our past errors.
We can then hasten the processes of nature's house cleaning
131
HARMONIOUS LIVING
by adding our intelligent efforts in co-operation with na-
ture's efforts of putting the house in order. Methods of
doing so will be discussed in another chapter.
For the past half century, the writer has devoted his efforts
largely to a continuous study, observation, experimenta-
tion and demonstration of the Laws and Principles govern-
ing human health and during those experiences not a single
instance of failure of these laws, to produce Constructive
and healing results, have come to the writer's attention,
wherein the Individual involved was able and willing to
make the conditions necessary for nature's constructive law
to rebuild the mistakes of the past.
The signficance of this statement is fully realized, as well
as the personal responsibility for the possession of this
knowledge and experience, in the face of the suffering,
misery and immature death of the physical body, over the
face of the earth.
But, because of the apparently endless difficulties of get-
ting this knowledge before the human race, the author has
been compelled to use the slow method of "casting single
pebbles into the stream of life" and awaiting for the ripples
to spread over the surface.
This present effort is now being made, in the hope of
awakening an interest in the "progressive teachers" who
guide human thought and to inspire them and others to help
remove the darkness and hasten the day of a better under-
standing of the Laws and Principles governing HEALTH,
HARMONY and HAPPINESS upon the face of the earth.
There seems to be but one way to overcome Intellectual
DARKNESS, and that is by EDUCATION.
The RESPONSIBILITY rests upon all those who have
become aware of these facts, to spend every wakeful mo-
ment possible, in making it practical for those who are suf-
fering and are ready and willing or can be inspired to be-
132
DEVELOPMENT OF DISEASE
come so, to live a harmonious life, that they shall be able
to do so.
If human beings KNEW the Natural Laws that govern
their lives and KNEW that they could not be VIOLATED
without suffering the penalty that conforms to that viola-
tion, WHO would care to deliberately, knowingly and
intentionally INFLICT PUNISHMENT UPON THEM-
SELVES? - when they could enjoy HEALTH and HAP-
PINESS by the simple and easy conformance to nature's
protecting laws?
It is inconceivable that a human being would prefer pain,
suffering and misery to peace, harmony, health and happi-
ness, if
THEY HAD THEIR CHOICE.
133
CHAPTER 23
A Fundamental and Vital
Mis-Understanding and
Mis-Interpreta tion
WHAT HAS BEEN MIS-UNDERSTOOD and mis-
interpreted to be the generation and growth and develop-
ment of dis-ease, is in reality
Nature's process of bringing about a CURE.
When the major organs of elimination (the bowels, kidneys
and lungs) become over-worked and are unable to remove
the impurities from the body as fast as they accumulate,
nature finds it necessary to open up "special channels" of
elimination for that purpose, so as to maintain the normal
functions of the body.
The pores of the skin upon the surface of the body, the
throat and other external outlets are made use of for that
purpose, when necessity requires it.
Skin eruptions of various kinds and degrees, ranging from
their mildest forms, such as rashes, pimples, eczema, to
the more extreme varieties, as scrofula, measles, mumps,
small pox, boils, tumors, carbuncles, cysts, goiters, cancer
and many other forms of elimination, such as so-called
common colds, influenza, chills and fevers, diarrhea and
various forms of fevers, which are in reality constitutional
processes of activity, represent NATURAL PROCESSES
OF ELIMINATION.
All of these processes and functions represent Nature's
special efforts to remove the accumulated impurities from
within the physical body, by forcing them to the surface
134
FUNDAMENTAL MIS-UNDERSTANDING
for elimination, or in the case of fevers, oxidizing the im-
purities in the lungs and eliminating them in the form of
gases.
Because of these past mis-understandings of nature's pro-
cesses and purposes, nature's efforts to CURE have been
assumed to be the generation of dis-ease.
As a result of such mis-interpretation, the attempts to bring
about a CURE have put into use every conceivable means
and method that would check or stop this house cleaning
process, resulting in the driving back into the physical
body, the impurities that nature was trying to remove.
In addition to the forcing of these impurities back into the
physical body or at least checking their elimination, the
"inorganic remedies used" in the attempted efforts to bring
about a "cure", are far more dangerous than the original
impurities that nature was trying to remove.
This is the BASIC REASON why practically every known
ailment of present day civilization has become INCUR-
ABLE by the present methods in use; from the simplest
form of a cold, to the entire chain of increasing complexi-
ties in the accumulation of "ailments".
When everything else fails, "cutting out" of the dis-eased
parts is made use of, in the hopeless attempt to stem the
tide.
All that is necessary to CURE or REMOVE any form of
dis-ease is, FIRST for the PATIENT to remove the orig-
inal cause or causes, and THEN to co-operate with nature's
processes of removing the accumulated impurities from
within the body.
Special Methods of co-operation with nature's purifying
processes, will be studied in a later chapter.
135
CHAPTER 24
Curing Dis-ease
DlS-EASE REPRESENTS AN accumulation of impuri-
ties within the physical body, as a result of the disregard
of or the violation of the laws governing man's life.
Its permanent cure requires
(1st) the permanent removal of its causes.
(2nd) co-operation with nature's processes, in the removal
of the accumulated impurities of past errors.
How may we co-operate with nature's "purification" of our
physical body?
The purification of our physical body, means the removal
from within the physical body of the impurities that it
contains, which necessitates the opening of all the normal
channels of elimination, and stimulating them to strenuous
activity.
The normal channels of elimination are:
The bowels, which remove the impurities of the body in
the form of solid and semi-solid substance;
The urinary canal, which removes the liquid impurities
from within the body;
The lungs, which discharge unrequired substance from the
body in the form of gases.
The entire surface of the body, the skin covering, when in
normal functioning condition, assists greatly in the removal
of impurities from within the body.
136
CURING DIS-EASE
When these organs become overworked or develop into a
weakened condition the nose and throat and other surface
outlets take up the work of HOUSE CLEANING to aid
in the maintenance of the normal functioning of the life
processes.
In what manner may we assist nature in stimulating these
organs of elimination?
First, we may do so by refraining from the use of concen-
trated foods, until such time as the normal internal guides
indicate the need of them, through the regular channels
of "hunger".
In their place, fruit acid liquids should be used freely, of
the following varieties; lemonade, grapefruit juice, orange
juice, pineapple juice, tomato juice, lime juice with water,
or plain water.
Fruit acid juices stimulate the activity throughout the
body, which thereby increases the generation of energy
and vitality. When the body has stored up a sufficient
amount of potential power, nature will then bring on a
strong elimination throughout the entire body. This pro-
cess is named "a cleansing crisis."
This will continue until nature indicates, with a signal, to
change the program and begin to rebuild fresh energy and
vitality. The time of crisis varies with individual condi-
tions. This change is indicated by a fresh demand for
regular food, through the channel of hunger.
The natural processes then build up additional surplus
energy; when in due time, nature indicates another crisis,
that is further removal of the remaining impurities. This
is indicated by the absence of hunger for regular food sub-
stance and the stimulation of the elimination processes,
and again acid fruit juices should be used, as they act as
the eliminators in times of crisis.
These acid juices stimulate the activities of the bowel and
137
HARMONIOUS LIVING
urinary processes, in their work of removing impurities
from the body.
Another strong aid, in the process of the purification of the
body, is the exposure of the nude body to the sun and air,
if this can be conveniently done. This is a very important
source of help during a crisis period.
In bathing the body with cold water, either by cold showers
or cold sponge baths, the room temperature should be warm,
or if taken out of doors, the atmosphere should be warm
and the water at faucet temperature.
The sun, air and cold water showers greatly stimulate the
activity of every cell of the skin surface of the body, as
well as acting as a stimulant to the body as a whole, for
those individuals whose vitality is sufficient to react to
cold water.
Stimulating the activity of the skin surface of the body
enables the skin to take on a large share of the cleansing
process from the overworked major organs of elimination.
Cold water sitz baths act as a powerful stimulant to the
bowel and kidney function.
In all applications of cold water treatments, the body
should warm up within a minute or two (or the parts to
which applied). Ice or ice water should never be used. If
reaction of warmth does not take place within a few minutes
at most, hot and cold applications should be used until the
vitality of the body is built up.
Cold packs applied to various parts of the body, where and
when needed, may be most conveniently used at night when
sleeping. They act as efficient stimulants to the parts where
they are applied. They prevent swelling at injured parts,
by carrying the broken down tissue into the general circu-
lation for elimination.
Cold water applications generate heat because they increase
the activity of the body, wherever they are applied. Cold
138
CURING DIS-EASE
water packs are exceptionally efficient for bruised parts,
swellings, or chronic conditions. They maintain an in-
creased circulation of the blood stream to the applied parts
and remove local congestion and in this manner aid in re-
construction.
They are beneficial in all cases, except when the body is so
very weak and the vitality is so low, that the body is unable
to react with sufficient force to generate heat. If within the
period of two or three minutes, the part to which a cold
pack is applied has not warmed up, the cold pack should
be removed and a hot one used, interchanged with a cold
one occasionally, until conditions have improved.
In a normally healthy person, the body reacts to a cold pack
almost instantly. Cold water applications are quite a con-
structive general aid to the restablishment of the normal
functioning of the body as a whole or to the parts wherever
applied.
It constitutes a wholesome harmless stimulant for almost
every occasion. It is not appropriate for use for women
during the menstrual period. Cold water distributes im-
purities from a center outwards, while menstruation func-
tions in the opposite direction, drawing impurities to a
center for elimination.
Fresh air and normal deep breathing, walking in the open
air or other constructive exercises stimulates the activity
of the lungs and the entire bodily function.
In fact, of all aides in the bodily cleansing process, normal
exercise of the body as a whole, constitutes the most effi-
cient methods, for it generates vitality, in addition to assist-
ing in the eliminative process.
A CHEERFUL, HOPEFUL STATE OF MIND is an-
other powerful influence to the normal processes of the
body.
Constructive thinking promotes the building up of the vital
139
HARMONIOUS LIVING
forces of the body. These mental forces are applicable to
all cases of illness, for beneficial results.
The "mechanical bodily applications" should be adjusted
to fit each individual condition, according to the status of
the individual at the time of application and gradually
increased as the improvements justifies.
EXCESSIVE HEAT weakens the body, MODERATE
COLD strengthens it.
Strong heat over-stimulates the vibrations of the body,
thereby consuming an excess of bodily energy, while mod-
erate cold stimulates the body into the degree of increased
activity, which generates a beneficial degree of heat. That
is the meaning and purpose in the application of cold packs,
cold showers, cold sitz baths and cold water applications in
general. They generate the degree of heat that is "con-
structive" to the activities of the bodily processes, in addi-
tion to generating an abundance of electro-magnetism.
Enemas should be used with caution. They may easily
become a "habit". For very weak individuals, bed-ridden
patients or in emergencies, they are required. But, when-
ever possible, the bowels should be helped to move by their
own efforts, by the application of cold sitz baths, cold packs
or massage. Long walks stimulate the bowel activity.
CONSTIPATION is the definite indication that the organs
of elimination are being overworked, and the body as a
whole is being underworked. The REMEDY is less food
and more use of the body, until a balance is established
between the intake and the outgo.
This balance must be maintained at all times, so as to har-
monize with the mechanical laws governing the physical
body, just as the moral law requires the Intelligence to
maintain a moral balance, through the process of giving
and receiving.
This same law of balance or equilibrium operates upon all
planes, wherever man functions, physical, spiritual, mental,
140
CURING DIS-EASE
moral and psychological. The harmonious blending of all
these forces and activities together represents Perfect
Health, the Ideal set for man by nature.
We need not become discouraged by the apparent difficulty
of the problem set for man by nature, because nature is
always just as well as kind, for she has given man "eternity"
to accomplish it in, regardless of temporary appearances to
the contrary. In due time we will learn, just as the chick
in the egg shell learns, when it breaks through its tempor-
ary limitations and becomes aware of the "continuity" of
its existence. Life is "continuous". We change our clothing
according to our need. The Individual Intelligence, like
matter and energy, is INDESTRUCTIBLE.
Coming back to the problem of establishing a "cure" for
our past errors, the time required for bringing about a
complete cure, depends upon the exact conditions that exist
at the time of starting the process.
Dis-eased conditions may be divided into two classifications,
(1st) primary or functional.
(2nd) organic.
Primary dis-ease is functional, and represents an accumu-
lation of impurities distributed throughout the body and
which was produced by the disregard or the violation of the
laws governing man's life.
Organic dis-ease represents dis-ease in its advanced stages,
that is, the impurities contained in the physical body have
begun to dis-integrate and destroy some of the organic
structure of the body, internally.
In such a situation, of course, it would take much longer
to bring about a complete re-construction of the disinteg-
rating organs.
In many cases during the rebuilding process, man is en-
abled to carry on the regular life activities, with the ex-
ception of the brief periods when nature brings on a
"cleansing or healing crisis."
141
HARMONIOUS LIVING
To obtain the best results at such times, it is necessary to
abstain from concentrated foods, and use fruit acid liquids,
until the crisis is over.
Internal growths or crystalized deposits, internally, may
be dissolved and eliminated by the process of making the
blood stream strongly acid, by the use of an acid fruit diet,
until normal conditions have been re-established.
As previously stated, every disease that the human being
is heir to, will gradually but surely, though slowly disap-
pear under the above treatment, if the causes have been
removed by the Individual involved.
It would be useless to remove impurities from within the
body, if other impurities continued to be reproduced, as
fast as the past errors were being removed.
We should realize one unquestionable fact: if we are in
"trouble", we have either neglected to listen to natural
guidance or we have deliberately violated that warning.
No one suffers without a CAUSE, and that cause lies with-
in ourselves.
Nature does not place us here, merely to SUFFER and DIE.
We are here to LEARN HOW TO LIVE so as to be
HEALTHY and HAPPY. The universe is a UNIVER-
SITY.
Individual Lives are the STUDENTS.
We are guided day and night against "outside forces" but
nature cannot protect us against OURSELVES, so long as
we possess a FREE WILL, which enables us to do as we
please, regardless of natural guidance.
We are the "culprits", not nature.
Dis-ease exists because man has the power to CREATE it.
When he ceases to produce it, it will cease to exist.
Nature does not "create disease". We in our inalienable
142
CURING DIS-EASE
right to exercise our own freedom of Will, create whatever
hell that exists.
When we have enjoyed it to our heart's content, and cease
feeding it, it will cease to exist for us. It will die of starva-
tion. This is as sure as the sun rises (to our vision) in the
morning and sets in the evening.
The sooner we discover that fact, the sooner disease will
cease to exist in our lives.
Heaven and Hell lie within our hands; so does FREEDOM
OF CHOICE.
The writer knows this to be a "fact", for he has demon-
strated its truth, daily for over half a century.
Do not take his word for it alone, try it YOURSELF and
KNOW, and not merely believe. Keeping in mind the fact
that GROWTH IS GRADUAL; a house is not built over-
night, but the sooner we start the sooner it will become a
reality.
HEALTH is the mansion we are to build for ourselves.
The first step is to remove the old mistakes of yesterday,
then we begin to build the healthy, normal condition.
How do we start? By first removing our DESTRUCTIVE
THOUGHTS and ACTIVITIES, and begin to build upon
the rock bottom indestructible foundation of Equity, Jus-
tice and Right.
And we will have a fireproof, earthquake proof, windproof,
yes, waterproof and even foolproof mansion, not built by
the hands eternally in the Heavens.
143
CHAPTER 25
Catching A Cold
WHAT IS A COLD? What its cause? and its cure?
When the physical body becomes saturated with impuri-
ties and it is subjected to a sudden lowering of the tempera-
ture this causes the body to shrink in volume (contract)
which produces an over-flow or an elimination of impuri-
ties, through some of the external openings of the body,
the nose, the throat and occasionally even through the eyes.
Let us study this phenomena at a little closer range.
Heat expands, Cold contracts. This principle applies to
physical phenomena in general.
If the organs of elimination are functioning normally,
then the blood stream is in normal condition and the body
can contract by the sudden lowering of the temperature,
without producing an over-flow of impurities (without
the catching of a so-called cold), but when the blood
stream is loaded with impurities and the bowel activity is
sluggish, then the sudden lowering of the temperature
causes a shrinking of the body, resulting in this condition
we call a cold, CATCHING A COLD. The cold was not
caught, it was within the body, otherwise there would have
been no evidence of a cold. The impurities were merely
trying to find a way out and not trying to find a way into
the body.
A cold is not caused by any activity of germs. It is solely
and purely an eliminative process. A person that is in
144
CATCHING A COLD
good health, does not, can not experience the condition
known generally as a cold. Such a person is immune to
colds and other forms of disease processes. This fact the
writer has been demonstrating throughout many years of
experience.
An example of the mechanical function of the common
cold. Suppose we take a sponge and place it in a container
of water, it will become saturated with the water, that is
it holds as much water as it can absorb. Now, let us take
that sponge and squeeze it the slightest amount and what
happens? The water begins to flow out through eyery
opening it can find. If the sponge contains very little
water, it will take extreme squeezing for the little it con-
tains to overflow, what little it contains will be eliminated
through the regular channels, the urinary canal and the
pores of the skin through evaporation. This example should
help to illucidate the function of a so-called cold. The
function of a cold may be truly described as a bodily
cleansing crises. Just what constitutes a bodily crises?
A BODILY CRISES
When a point is reached in the life of the individual, that
the mistakes, errors or natural law violations occur faster
than the regular organs of elimination are able to remove,
then the governing intelligence of the body is forced to
call into service, other organs of the body to aide in the
special emergency, just as the fire department finds it
necessary to call upon as many other branches as the need
may justify, in case of a fire getting beyond the capacity
of the local fire department to control, and this is what
science names a crises, a condition that requires extraordi-
nary effort and assistance.
How may we recognize a crises in our physical body?
When our body feels logy, when our vitality is low, when
there is no normal desire for food or for normal activity,
145
HARMONIOUS LIVING
we may feel sure that a crises is approaching and we will
not be kept long in doubt.
Just like a sudden rain-storm, the body will begin the pro-
cess of elimination through every convenient outlet, de-
pending upon the amount of vitality possessed by the in-
dividual at the time, and the extent of the accumulation of
impurities that are to be removed.
If the person is young and strong and possesses plenty of
vitality, then the bowels will be called into extraordinary
activity. This process, when it takes place, is called diar-
rhea. This is a very effective function, when it can be
brought into action, but few individuals possess the needed
strength for to arouse the process to such a degree, and so
other organs are brought into co-operative assistance in
the temporary process or emergency house cleaning, the
nose and throat and the surface of the skin are the most
common channels called into service as emergency assist-
ants. Chills and fever is a common method of house-
cleaning in emergency crises. Eruptions upon the surface
of the skin in many varieties and forms are made use of by
Nature in carrying out the purification process of remov-
ing the accumulated impurities from within the body.
After a cleansing crises, the body feels purer, cleaner,
lighter and full of energy. In due time, when the individual
permits the necessary conditions to prevail, Nature wilj
establish and maintain good health, in so long as contrary
conditions are not permitted to exist.
It is all up to each individual as ruler of his or her own
destiny. If we do our part, Nature does not fail to give us
the results we earn.
146
CHAPTER 26
Foods
WHILE ALL HUMAN BEINGS find it necessary to use
food to sustain the life of the physical body, the character
and quantity of food varies as the individuality varies.
The fact that each human being represents a different state
or condition, physically, spiritually, mentally, morally and
psychically, would indicate quite clearly, that the food
problem is largely individualistic, depending upon the con-
dition of each one's mental and physical status; their occu-
pation, their environment, climatic conditions, the amount
and character of the physical and mental exercises they en-
gage in, their age and many other influences, are all more
or less determining factors, in the kind of food required as
well as the quantity.
This makes one fact quite self-evident, that no set single
rule may be established, in relation to the food question,
that will function harmoniously with all human beings, at
all times and places, unless it be "moderation" in the use of
food, but even moderation varies with different individuals,
depending upon the nature of the life each individual lives.
While this may cause the food problem to appear as quite
a complex, the question really becomes very much simpli-
fied in its application.
First, there is the natural internal guidance for each and
every human being. Second, in due time, there develops an
147
HARMONIOUS LIVING
intelligent, rational self-guidance, through knowledge and
understanding of the law.
Our internal guidance adapts itself to our needs at all times,
when we learn to rely upon it. This simplifies the food
question to fit the understanding of each individual. Com-
plexity arises only when the individual seeks external
guidance and ignores the only accurate and reliable source
of knowledge—the internal personal guidance.
Our internal guides will make known to us the needs of the
body that will harmonize with our thoughts and actions.
Insofar as we are governed by their guidance, we will not
stray very far from the actual needs of the body.
We experience the feeling of hunger, the feeling of thirst,
the feeling of tiredness, the feeling of exuberance, we feel
hot, we feel cold, we feel pain, we feel pleasure, these are
examples of this internal guidance.
When these requirements or needs have been supplied or
taken care of, we experience the feeling of satisfaction.
Nature in her wisdom, guides each and every individual
along the pathway that leads to health and harmony, until
the individual evolves the Intelligence and understanding
of the Natural Law of Cause and Effect.
When the Individual Intelligence has attained to that sta-
tus, he has reached his MAJORITY. He is then able to be
on his own, that is to live in harmony with the Constructive
Principle in Individual Life, through his knowledge of the
law.
Having acquired a knowledge and understanding of the
function of CAUSE and EFFECT, he henceforth is able
to know in advance, what the effect will be from any given
cause, and this constitutes the second method by which the
food problem can be solved by each individual.
We are therefore guided by our internal directors, until we
acquire a technical knowledge and understanding of the
148
FOODS
relationships of effects to their causes, which knowledge
helps us to take over the directive responsibility for our
own well being. That is, to know precisely what cause to
initiate to obtain the exact results we desire.
Which means the ability to select the particular foods and
the correct quantity, that will produce the desired effect.
There are "general laws" pertaining to food substance,
which every human being should familiarize himself with,
and they are as follows:
(1st) as to their polarity or magnetic value.
(2nd) as to their degree of fineness.
(3rd) as to their degree of concentration.
(1st) Foods, like everything known to exist, are governed
by the Universal Law of Polarity, that is, all food sub-
stance is either positively or negatively charged or both
(bi-sexual or balanced).
To maintain the healthy functioning of the physical body,
the polarity of food needs to be balanced.
The acid foods represent the positive polarity; such as
lemons, limes, grapefruit, tomatoes, pineapples, oranges and
many other varieties of fruits and vegetables that are
aciduous.
The bases represent the opposite or negative polarity; such
as starches, legumes, fats, oils, sugars, proteids and so forth.
Some foods represent a balanced polarity, of which milk
is an example.
(2nd) Foods vary in their character, chiefly in their degree
of fineness of their particles. Generally speaking, those
foods that grow in the soil are of coarser texture, and are
more positive, in a physical sense, in their electro-magnetic
forces.
In a general sense, foods growing upon vines are finer in
particle than those growing within the ground and nega-
149
HARMONIOUS LIVING
tive, electro-magnetically, in relation to those growing
within the ground.
Foods growing above the ground generally are of finer
texture, the higher they grow above the ground, likewise
their magnetic forces become more physically negative.
Electro-magnetic forces that are physically positive are
spiritually negative and conversely, electro-magnetic forces
that are physically negative are spiritually positive.
(3rd) Foods vary in their degree of concentration, accord-
ing to the proportion of water they contain.
The less water they contain, the greater the food concen-
tration, and the greater the CAUTION necessary in the
amounts required to be used, depending upon the amount
of work performed and other related factors.
The greater the percentage of water contained in food
substance, the easier they are digested, generally speaking.
The coarser foods, such as beets, potatoes and the highly
concentrated foods, such as the grains and the dry beans,
are more easily digested when cooked, generally speaking.
The concentrated foods produce a heating effect, and the
watery foods have a cooling effect, generally speaking.
To those engaged in sedentary work, they can obtain the
nost efficient results with a light, fine, rapid-acting body;
while those performing heavy laborious work, can do their
best work with a heavier, slower moving body.
The former would require finer foods in amounts propo-
tioned to the amount of work performed, while the latter
would need heavier foods and of coarser texture, in amounts
determined by the volume of work performed, other things
being equal.
Human beings residing near the polar regions require heat-
foods, while those living in the region of the equator would
require cooling foods.
Those living in the temperate zones need to adjust their
150
FOODS
foods in harmony with their environment and activity,
heating foods during the winter period, and cooling foods
for the summer time.
When an excess of food is used at a single meal, to avoid
difficulty additional exercise should be taken, so that the
body can consume the food that was used and the individual
should refrain from using any more solid food, until the
body indicates the need by the sensation of hunger.
Under such circumstances, plenty of acid liquids should be
used, as an aid to the eliminative processes of the body.
CONSTIPATION is the unquestionable indication that
there are more accumulated impurities within the body
than the organs of elimination are able to remove.
Under all such circumstances, the use of concentrated foods
should cease at once and fruit acid liquids should be used,
additional exercise should be taken until the bowels begin
to function (walking is very helpful).
In extreme cases, enemas may be used temporarily, to help
overcome the difficulty, fruit acid liquids should be used
and plenty of exercise, which is very beneficial when the
patient is able to use that method.
Individuals engaged mainly in mental work, can obtain
much better results by the use of the finer foods, such as
fruits, nuts and a moderate amount of dairy products and
eggs, an abundance of walking and other physical exercise.

CHAPTER 27
Age and Health
Age AS IT IS COMMONLY understood, represents the
time expired from the moment of the birth of the physical
body to the present moment.
Normally speaking, the physical body, from birth, grows
and develops until it reaches maturity or physical comple-
tion. When that point is reached, physical growth ceases,
and development from that point onward is confined to the
growth and development of the intelligence, residing in and
controlling the physical body.
When the governing Intelligence learns to live in harmony
with the Constructive Principle governing Individual Life,
the physical body will maintain its status of maturity, dur-
ing the life of the Intelligence in the physical body, without
showing the evidence of what we generally name "old age,"
the deterioration, the weakening, the hardening and the
slowing down of the life process.
That does not represent the Evolutionary process in nature,
but the contrary. It represents the accumulation of our
errors, mistakes and violations of nature's laws. When we
learn how, we can in due time, remove the conditions in
the physical body that have (so-called) aged the body and
bring it back to its normal matured status, with all its
normal vitality, strength, agility and elasticity that it pos-
sessed at maturity. In fact those powers and forces are
increased by our understanding of and conformance to the
Constructive Laws governing life.
152
AGE AND HEALTH
How does the writer know this to be a fact? By personal
experience. Closely approaching the annals of eighty years,
my physical body is maintaining the agility, elasticity and
vitality on a par, if not in excess of what it was in youth.
In addition, I have had the privilege of meeting a number
of human beings whose physical age was considerably great-
er, that possessed the elasticity of youth and who lived
"painless" lives. These are not mere exceptions. This rep-
resents a possibility for each and every human being that
acquires a knowledge of the Constructive Law of Life, and
puts forth their sincere efforts to conform to it.
There is no "special privilege" in the realms of natural law.
Everyone stands as an EQUAL before the bar of natural
justice.
Equality of opportunity for every one.
We may obtain whatever we prepare ourselves to earn.
In Nature it is earn it and you have it.
There does not seem to be any other way to SUCCESS.
Those who acquire things they have not earned, possess
only the shadow of the things, not the reality itself. A
human being who amasses a vast accumulation of material
wealth, unless it is used for the general good, becomes the
slave to those material things. He does not and cannot
enjoy them. It was necessary to sacrifice the joys of living
to acquire the accumulation of material wealth and it re-
quires just as much, if not more of a sacrifice to hold it.
The possession of material things beyond the normal needs
of a human being is a mirage, unless used for the general
good.
The law of life materially is fifty-fifty, balance or equili-
brium, but when we enter the realm of the Intelligence,
there we cannot possess what we have not earned and paid
for, its full price. And when we have paid for it, that is
earned it, we possess it in such manner that we cannot be
deprived of it. Intellectually, we become the thing when
we earn it and it is then Indestructible.
153
HARMONIOUS LIVING
When we earn health, harmony, love, happiness, truth, hon-
esty, generosity, that is what represents the "true age" of
a human being, the distance that has been traveled by the
Individual Intelligence along the pathway of Intellectual
and Moral growth and development.
If we want to know the "true age" of a human being, it
is the distance traveled upon the ladder of Evolution, the
status in the scale of Equity, Justice and Right; that is the
true measure of age as well as the determining factor in the
health, harmony and happiness of the Individual.

Some Terms
As Defined By Natural Science
LIFE is that element in Nature which impels everything,
whether organic or inorganic, physical, spiritual or psy-
chological, to function according to the law of its being.
SCIENCE is the exact knowledge of the facts of Nature,
classified and systematized.
FACTS. A fact is that which is.
KNOWLEDGE. Actual knowledge comprises those things
which fall within the radius of our own individual experi-
ence and which we have personally demonstrated by the
aid of our senses. Facts of Nature, identified, verified and
acknowledged by human Intelligence.
EXPERIENCE is a conscious personal impression. These
impressions constitute our definite personal knowledge.
TRUTH is the established relation which the facts of
Nature sustain to each other and to the Individual Intelli-
gence or Soul of man.
LEARNING is not knowledge. Learning is purely mental.
It becomes knowledge when materially embodied. One
learns as he apprehends, one knows as he comprehends.
Knowledge is acquired through union of mind and matter.
ATTENTION is the individual voluntary exercise of the
wakeful consciousness to a specific and definite end.
CONCENTRATION is the intensive, exclusive, rational
mental activity, the process of fixing and holding attention
of the mind upon a definite subject of thought, for a
specific purpose.
IMPULSE is a conscious unpremeditated force of the Soul.
An impulse of the human soul, formulated into a definite
thought is a force.
155
VITALITY is the sum total of all the life elements.
NATURAL SCIENCE is that science which includes all
other sciences and departments of science, physical, spiri-
tual, mental, moral and psychological.
PHYSICAL SCIENCE is that science which has to do with
physical matter only.
SPIRITUAL SCIENCE has to do only with things spir-
itual.
MENTAL SCIENCE is limited to a knowledge of the
Mind, with its functions and phenomena.
MIND is that particular activity of the Soul which mani-
fests itself in all the intellectual, rational and intelligent
processes of human beings. It is the sum total of all the
intellectual activities of the Soul.
MEMORY is an attribute of a Soul by means of which an
Individual Intelligence receives and retains a knowledge
of its past experience and is not necessarily under control
of the Individual Intelligence. It is the storehouse of the
Individual Intelligence.
RECOLLECTION is the power by which Individual Intel-
ligence may recall past experiences to consciousness.
INDIVIDUAL INTELLIGENCE or SOUL is the Intelli-
gent ego, entity or essential being which inhabits and ope-
rates both the physical body and spiritual body and mani-
fests itself through them.
PHILOSOPHY is the conclusions which men in their
search for a knowledge of truth, have drawn from the facts
of Nature.
RELIGION is the application of the facts of science and
the conclusions of philosophy to individual life and conduct.
WISDOM is the right application of knowledge and the
right use of power.
MORAL RESPONSIBILITY is the Soul's recognition
that there is a Moral Order in Nature, and that the Indi-
vidual Intelligence is bound by that Moral Order to ex-
emplify Morality in the living of his life, to the full
measure of his knowledge.
PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY is the obligation
156
which God or Nature fixes upon Man, to conform his life
to his own standard of Equity, Justice and Right.
The measure of MECHANICAL ERROR is Lack of knowl-
edge of the Law of Mechanics.
Nature is responsible for all life below Man.
To be wholly responsible for his actions, an Individual
must act, Self-Consciously, Independently and Rationally.
RATIONAL, Anticipating the relationships of the Law of
Cause and Effect. Reliance upon one's own reasoning pow-
ers and rational processes.
