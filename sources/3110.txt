NOTE.
This fcicjimile of one of the
earlieft books on “ the Art of
Legerdemain ” has been produced
in the belief that it will prove
interefting to lovers of the Art
in the prefent day.
The “patter ” to tricks on pages
16 and 43, and the trick of “how
to thrift a dagger into your
guts,” are perhaps not quite suit-
able for a modern drawing-
room entertainment ; but it is
remarkable that a number of
moft effective modern experiments
Note.
are simply elaborations of tricks
at leaft one hundred years old.
The confederacy trick on page yi
contains the effence of “ second
sightf brought to such perfection
by the late Robert Heller ; it
alfo contains the effence of one
of the moft celebrated feats of
the great Robert Houdin ; and
the card trick on page 62 con-
tains the secret of the trick—of
reading names written on pieces
of paper — so often performed
by that pecidiar breed of con-
jurers who pretend to expofe
Spiritualifm.
This facfimile has been printed
at the office of Robert Anderson,

In PERFECTION.
LEgerdemain is an operation whereby one
may feem to work wonderful, impoffible,
and incredible things, by agility, nimblenefs,
and flight of hand. The parts of this inge-
nious art, are principally four.
Firft, In conveyance of balls.
Secondly, In conveyance of money,
Thirdly, In cards,
Fourthly, In confederacy.
A Defcription of the Operator.
i. He mull be one of a bold and undaunt-
ed refolution, fo as to fet a good face upon
the matter.
2.
He muft have ftrange terms, and empha-
tical words, to grace and adorn his actions
;
and the more to amaze and aftonifli the be-
holders.
3.
And laftly, He muft ufe fuch geftures
of body, as may take off the fpedlators eyes
from
8 The Art of Legerdemain;
from a ftrict and diligent beholding his man-
ner of performance.
How to pafs the Balls through the Cups.
You muft place yourfelf at the farther end
of the table, and then you muft provide your-
felf three cups made of tin, and then you
muft have your black fticks of magic to fhew
your wonders withal : then you muft provide
four fmall cork balls to play with ;
but do not
let more than three of them be feen upon
the table.
Note, Always conceal one ball in the right
hand, between your middle finger and ring
finger : and be fure make yourfelf perfect to
hold it there, for by this means all the tricks
of the cups are done.
Then fay as followeth.
Gentlemen,
three cups Pis true,
They are but tin,
the reafon why,
Silver is fomething dear,
Til turn them in gold, if I live, &c.
No equivocation at all
:
But ifyour eyes are not as quick as my hands
IJhall deceive you all.
View them within,
View them all round about,
Where there is nothing in.
There's nothing can come out.
Then

Then take your four balls privately be-
tween your fingers, and fo fling one of them
upon the table, and fay thus,
The firfl trick that e'er I learn'd to do,
Was, ont of one ball to make it into two :
Ahl fince it cannot better be,
One of thefe two, I'll divide them into three,
Which is call'd the firft trick of dexterity.
So then you have three balls on the table
to play with, and one left between the fin-
gers of your right hand.
The Operation of the Cups is this.
Lay your three balls on the table, then
fay, Gentlemen, you fee here are three balls,
and here are three cups, that is, a cup for
each ball, and a ball for each cup. Then tak-
ing that ball that you had in your right hand,,
(which you are always to keep private) and
clapping it under the firft cup, then taking up
one of the three balls, with your right hand,,
feeming to put it into your left hand, but re-
tain it ftill in your right, fhutting your left
hand

hand in due time, then fay, Prefio be gone.
Then taking the fecond cup up, fay, Gen-
tlemen, you fee there is nothing under my
cup; fo clap the ball that you have in your
right hand under it, and then take the fecond
ball up with your right hand, and feem to put
it into your left, but retain it in your right
hand, fhutting your left hand in due time, as
before, faying, Verda,
be gone.

Then take the third cup, faying, Gentle-
men, you fee there is nothing under my laft
cup; then clapping the ball you have in your
right hand under it, then take the third ball
up with your right hand, and feeming to put it
into your left hand, but retain it in your right;
fhutting your left hand in due time, as be-
fore, faying, Prefio,
make hafte
;
fo you have
your three balls come under your three cups,
as thus; and fo lay your three cups down on
the table.
Then
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. u
Then with your right hand take up the firft
cup, and there clap that ball under, that you
have in your right hand; then faying, Gen-
tlemen, this being the firft ball, I will put it
into my pocket; but that you muft ftill keep
in your hand to play withal.
So take up the fecond cup with your right
hand, and clap that ball you have concealed
under it, and then take up the fecond ball
with your right hand, and fay, this likewife,
I take and put into my pocket.
Likewife, take up the third cup, and clap-
ping the cup down again, convey that ball
you have in your right hand under the cup,
then taking the third ball, fay, Gentlemen,
this being the laft ball, I take and put this
into my pocket. Afterwards fay to the com-
pany, Gentlemen, by a little of my fine pow-
der of experience, I will command thefe balls
under the cups again.
As
12 The Art of Legerdemain ;
As thus,
So lay them all along upon the table to the
admiration of all the beholders.
Then take up the firft cup, and clap the
ball you have in your right hand under it,
then taking the firft ball up with your right
hand, feem to put the fame into your left
hand, but retain it ftill in your right, then
fay, Vade, quick be gone when I bid you,
and
run under the cup.
Then taking that cup up again, and fling-
ing that you have in your right hand under
it, you muft take up the fecond ball, and feem
to put it into your left hand, but retain it in
your right hand, faying, Gentlemen, fee how
the ball runs on the table.
So feemingly fling it away, and it will ap-
pear as thus.
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 13
So taking the fame cup again, then clap-
ping the ball under again as before, then tak-
ing the third ball in your right hand, and feem
to put it under your left, but ftill retain it in
your right, then with your left hand feem to
fling it in the cup, and it will appear thus; all
the three balls to be under one cup.
And if you can perform thefe adlions with
the cups, you may change thefe balls into ap-
ples, pears, or plumbs, or to living birds, to
what your fancy leads you to. I would have
given you more examples, but I think thefe
are fufficient for the ingenious, fo that by
thefe means you may perform all manner of
aflions with the cups.
Note, The artificial cups cannot well be
defcribed by words but you may have them
of me, for they are accounted the greateft
fecrets in this art : therefore I advice you to
keep them as fuch, for this was never known
to the world before.
How to fliew the wonderful Magic Lanthorn.
This is the magic lanthorn that has made
fo much wonder in the world, and that which
Friar Bacon ufed to fhew all his magical won-
ders withal.
B This
14 The Art of Legerdemain ;
This lanthorn is called magic, with refpedt
to the formidable apparitions that by virtue of
light it fhews upon the white wall of a dark
room. The body of it is generally made of
tin, and of the fhape of a lamp; towards the
back part, is a concave looking glafs of metal,
which may either be fpherical or parabolical,
and which by a grove made in the bottom of
the lanthorn, may either be advanced nearer
or put farther back from the lamp, in which
is oil or fpirit of wine, and the match ought
to be a little thick, that when it is lighted, it
may caft a good light that may eafily reflect
from the glafs to the fore part of the lanthorn,
where there is an aperture with the perfpefiive
in it, compofed of two glaffes that make the
rays converge and magnify the objeft.
When you mean to make ufe of this admi-
rable machine, light the lamp, the light of
which will be much augmented by the look-
ing glafs at a reafonable diftance. Between
the fore part of the lanthorn, and the perfpec-
tive glafs, you have a trough made on pur-
pofe, in which you are to run a long flat thin
frame with feveral different figures, painted
with tranfparent colours upon glafs; then all
thefe little figures paffing fucceflively before
the perfpe£tive glafs through which paffes the
light of the lamp, will be painted, and repre-
fented with the fame colours upon the wall
of a dark room, in a gigantic and monftrous
manner.
By
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 15
By this Lanthorn you may fhew what man,
or woman, or birds, or beafts, and all forts of
fifh that are in the fea : fo if any gentleman
has a defire to furnifh themfelves with one of
thefe lanthorns, I have the beft that can be
made.
The figitre is as follows.
To feem to fwallow a long pudding made of tin.
This pudding muft be made of tin, confift-
ing of twelve or thirteen little hoops made as
in the figure following, fo as they may almoft
feem to fall one through another, having little
holes made at the biggeft end thereof, that it
may not hurt your mouth, hold this pudding
B 2 for
1 6 The Art 0/ Legerdemain ;
(for fo it is called) privately in 3/our left hand,
with the hole end uppermoft, and with your
right hand take a ball out of your pocket,
and fay, ‘
If here is ever a maid, that has loft
her maiden head, or an old woman that is out
of conceit with herfelf, becaufe her neigh-
bours deem her not fo young as fhe would
be, let them come to me, for this ball is a
prefent remedy:’ then feem to put the ball
into your left hand, but let it flip into your
lap, and clap your pudding into your mouth,
which will be thought to be the ball that you
fhewed them; then decline your head, and
open your mouth, and the pudding will flip
down at its full length, which with your right
hand you may ftrike it into your mouth again,
doing this three or four times, then you may
difcharge it into your hand, and clap it into
your pocket without any fufpicion, by mak-
in three or four wry faces after it, as tho’
it ftuck in your throat, and if you pradtife
fmiting eafily upon your throat with your fift
on each fide, the pudding will feem to chink;
as if it were lying there ;
then fay, ‘
Thus the)/
eat puddings in High Germany, they fling it
down their throats before their teeth can take
poffeffion of it.

To feem to eat knifes andforks.
Defire any one of the fpe&ators to lend you
a knife, which when you get hold of, fo
that you may cover the whole with both
hands, the end of the haft excepted, and fet-
ting the point to your eye, faying, “Some
body ftrike it with your fift,” but nobody
will, becaufe it is fo dangerous a thing; then
fetting your hand on'the fide of the table and
looking about you, afk, “ What, will nobody
ftrike it in ?
” in which time let the knife flip
into your lap, then make as if you chop it
haftily into your mouth, or to hold it with
one hand, and to ftrike it in with the other
nimbly, making three or four wry faces, fay-
ing, “Some drink, fome drink,” or elfe,
“ Now let fomebody put his finger into my
mouth, and pull it out again,” fome will cry,
“You will bite me,” fay, I will affure you
I will not :” then when he hath put his finger
in, he will pull it out and cry, There is no-
thing ;
this is time fufficient to convey the
knife into your pocket ;
then fay, Why, you
have your finger again : So by this means you
may fwallow knives and forks.
To put a lock upon a man's mouth.
You muft have a lock made for this pur-
pofe, according to the figure ;
one fide of its
bow muft be immoveable, as that marked
B 3 with
18 The Art of Legerdemain;
with A, the other fide is noted with B, and
muft be pinned to the body of the lock, as
appears at E, I fay it muft be fo pinned that
it may play to and fro with eafe ;
this fide of
the bow muft have a leg as at C, and then
turn it into the lock ;
this leg muft have two
notches filled in the inner fide, which muft be
fo ordered, that one may lock or hold the
two Tides of the bow as clofe together as may
be, and the other notch to hold the faid part
of the bow a proportionable diftance afunder,
that being locked upon the cheek, it may nei-
ther pinch too hard, nor yet hold it fo flight
that it may be drawn off ;
let there be a key
fixed to it, to unlock it, as you fee at D, and
laftly, let the bow have divers notches filled
in it, fo that the place of the partition when
the lock is fhut home, will the leaft of all be
fufpedled in the ufe of the lock ;
you muft get
one to hold a teller edge long between his
teeth, then take another teller, and with your
left hand proffer to fet it edge-ways between
a fecond man’s teeth, pretending that your
intent is to turn both into which of their
mouths they fhall defire, by virtue of your
words : which he fhall no fooner confent to
do, but you by holding your lock privately
in your right hand, with your fore-finger may
flip it over his cheek, and lock it by prefling
your fore-finger a little down, after fome flore
of words, and the lock having hung on a
while, feem to pull the key out of his nofe.

How to Jliew the magic hell and bufhel.
This feat may well be called magical, for
really it is very amazing, if it be well handled.
This device was never known to the public
before.
This bufhel muft be turned neatly like
unto the egg-boxes, fo that they cannot find
out where it opens, and you muft have a falfe
lid to clap on and off, and upon that falfe lid
glew fome bird-feed, and then you muft have
a
20 The Art of Legerdemain ;
a true lid made to clap neatly upon the falfe
one, now you muft have your artificial bell to
Jfhew with your bufhel.
You may make your bell with wood, or
brafs, your bell muft be made to unfcrew at
the top, that it may hold as much feed as
your bufhel will when it is filled, and you
muft have the handle of your bell made with
a fpring, fo as to let the feed fall down at
your word of command.
The manner how to ufe them is as follow-
eth : Note you muft be fure to fill the top
of your bell with feed before you begin to
fhew, then faying, Gentlemen, you fee I have
nothing in my bell (which they cannot, if you
hold it by the handle) nor have I any thing
in my bufhel, therefore I will fill my bufhel
with feed,) and in filling it clap on the falfe
lid, and no man can tell the contrary.
Then afk any body in the company to hold
that feed in their hands and you will command
it all under the magical bell, fo clap the true
lid on, and then ring your bell, and the feed
will be gone out of your bufhel into your bell,
to the admiration of all the beholders.
If you cannot rightly conceive this by words
you may have them of neweft fafhions, ready
made, at my houfe.

How to put a ring through ones cheek.
You muft have two rings made of filver or
brafs, or what you pleafe, of one bignefs,
colour, and likenefs, faving that one muft have
a notch through, and the other muft be
whole, without a notch ;
fhew the whole ring,
and conceal that which hath the notch, and
fay, Now I will put this ring through my
cheek, and privately flip the notch over one
fide of your mouth,
f
then take a fmall ftick
which you muft have in readinefs, and flip
the whole ring upon it, holding your hand o-
ver it about the middle of the ftick; then bid
fomebody hold faft the ftick at both ends,
and fay, fee this ring in my cheek, it turns
round; then while you perceive them faften
their eyes upon that ring, upon a fudden
whip it out, and fmite upon the ftick there-
with inftantly concealing it, and whirling the
other ring, you hold your hand over round
about the ftick, and it will be thought that
you have brought that ring upon the ftick
which was upon your cheek.

How to Jhew the Hen and Egg-bag,
a7id out
of an empty bag to bring out above an hun-
dred eggs,
and afterwards to brmg out a liv-
ing hen.
You
22 The Art of Legerdemain ;
You muft go and buy two or three yards of
callicoe, or printed linen, and make a double
bag, and on the mouth of the bag on that fide
next to you, you muft make four or five lit-
tle purfes, in which you muft put two or three
eggs in a purfe, and do fo till you have filled
that fide next to you, and have a hole made
at one end of your bag, that no more than
two or three eggs come out at once ;
then
you muft have another bag, like unto that
exadtly; that one muft not be known from the
other, and then put a living hen into that
bag, and hang it on a hook on that fide you
ftand. The manner of performing it is thus,
Take the egg bag, and put both your hands
in it and turn it infide out, and fay, Gentlemen,
you fee there is nothing in my bag ;
and in
turn-
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 23
turning it again you muft flip fome of the eggs
out of the purfes, as many as you think fit,
and then turn your bag again and fhew the
company that it is empty, and in turning it a-
gain you command more eggs to come out,
and when all is come out but one, you muft
take that egg and fhew it to the company,
and then drop down your egg bag, and take
up your hen bag, and fo fhake your hen,
pidgeon, or any other fowl. This is a noble
fancy if well handled.
How to cut the blowing book.
Take a book feven inches long, and about
five inches broad, and let there be forty nine
leaves, that is feven times feven contained
therein fo as you may cut upon the edges of
each leaf fix notches, each notch in depth of
a quarter of an inch, with a gouge made for
that purpofe, and let them be one inch dif-
tant ;
paint every thirteenth and fourteenth
page, which is the end of every fixth leaf and
beginning of every feventh with like colours,
or pictures, cut off with a pair of fheers, eve-
ry notch of the firft leaf, leaving only one
inch of paper, which will remain half a quar-
ter of an inch above that leaf, leave another
like inch in the fecond part of the fecond leaf,
clipping away an inch of paper in the higheft
place above it, and all notches below the fame,
and orderly to the third and fourth, and fo
as
24 The Art of Legerdemain ;
as there fhall reft upon each leaf only one
nick of paper above the reft, one high uncut,
an inch of paper muft anfwer to the firft di-
redtly, fo as when you have cut the firft feven
leaves in fuch a manner as I have defcribed,
you are to begin the felf fame order at the
eighth leaf, defcending the fame manner to
the cutting other feven leaves to twenty one,
until you are paft through every leaf all the
thicknefs of your book, &c.
This feat is fooner learn’d by demonftrative
means, than taught by words of inftrudtion ;
fo if any perfon wants to be furnifhed with
thefe blowing books they may have them at
my fhop on Little-tower-hill aforefaid.
To fhezv the trick with the Fu?i?iel.
You muft get a double funnel, that is two
funnels foldered one within the other, fo that
you may at the little end pour in a quantity of
wine or water, this funnel you may have rea-
dy filled before hand, with whatfoever liquor
you pleafe, and call for fome of the fame
kind
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 25
kind, then draw your funnel, and fetting your
middle finger into the bottom of it, bid fome
body, or elfe do it yourfelf, pour it full, and
drink it up before them, and turn the broad
end of the funnel downwards, faying, “ Gen-
tlemen, all is gone;” and in a trice turn
yourfelf about, and in turning pronounce
fome terms of art, withdraw your finger from
the narrow end, and let the liquor out be-
tween the funnels, and it will be thought to
be that which you drank out of the funnel,
and fo you may perfuade them it is the fame.
How to make three little children dance in a
glafs upon a table.
p
26 The Art of Legerdemain ;
Take little figures of glafs that are made
hollow, of an inch and a half high, reprefent-
ing little boys, which may be had at the glafs-
blowers ;
thefe little images have a fmall hole
in one of their legs, and are lighter than water
;
immerge them into the water contained in the
glafs A. B. this glafs is about a foot or 15 in-
ches high, and covered with a bladder which
is tied faft over the top; a fmall quantity of
air is to be left between the bladder and fur-
face of the water ;
fo when you command
them to walk down, prefs your hand hard up-
on the top, and they will immediately come
down, and fo you may make them dance in the
middle of the glafs, at your pleafure ;
and
when you would have them go up to the top,
take your hand away, and they will walk up.
I hope this is fufficient for your underftand-
ing ;
if not, you may have the glafs and fi-
gures of me.
Bonus Genius: or Hiccius Doclius.
You

You muft have the figure of a man made
of wood, about the bignefs of your little fin-
ger, the head whereof, muft be made to take
off and put on at pleafure, by means of a
wire that is in the neck ;
alfo you muft have
a cloth cap with a little bag within to convey
the head into, the bag muft be neatly made
that it may not eafily be perceived : fhew your
man to the company, ‘
Gentlemen, this I call
my Bonus Genius:’ then fhew the cap, fay-
ing, ‘This is his coat;’ fay moreover, ‘Look
now as ftedfaft as you can, neverthelefs I will
cozen you, for therefore am I come;’ then
hold your cap above your face, and take your
man in your , right-hand, and put his head
through the hole of the cap, faying, ‘
Now
he is ready to go on any meffage I have to
fend him to Spain or to Italy, or whither I
will, but he muft have fomewhat to bear his
charges,’ with that pull out your right-hand
from under the cap, and therewith the body,
put privately putting your right-hand into
your pocket, as if you felt for money, where
you may hide the body, and take out your
hand and fay, ‘There is three crowns for you,
now be gone,’ then turn the head, and fay,
‘
But he will look about him before he goes ;
then fay, fetting your fore-finger upon his
crown, ‘ Juft as I thruft my finger down fo he
fhall vanifh ;’
and therewith by the affiftance of
your left-hand that is under the cap, convey
his head into the little bag within the cap,
C 2 then

then turn your cap about, and fay, ‘
See here
he is gone;’ then take up your cap and hold
it up again, throwing the head out of the lit-
tle bag and fay, ‘
Hie mecus Genius,’ and in
the mean time thruft the head through the
hole of the cap, and holding the head by the
wire, turn it about prefently, and put the
head into your pocket.

on that is defirous to learn
any part of this art,

Of conveyance of Money.
The conveyance of money is not much in-
ferior to the balls, but much eafier to do ;
the
principal place to hold a piece of money is
the palm of your hand, the belt piece to keep
is a tefter, but with exercife all will be alike :
except the money be very fmall, and then it
is to be between the fingers almoft at the fing-
er ends, whereas the ball is to be kept below
near to the palm, the money muft not be of
too large a circumference.
To convey money out of one of your hands into
the other by Legerdemain.
Firft, you muft hold open your right-hand,
and lay therein a tefter or fome big piece of
money, then lay thereupon the top of your

long left finger, and ufe words, and upon a
fudden flip your right-hand from your finger,
wherewith you hold down the tefter ftill
therein, and fuddenly, I fay, drawing your
right-hand through your left, you will feem
to have left the tefter there, efpecially when
you fhut in due time your left hand, which
that it may more plainly appear to be truly
done, you may take a knife and feem to
knock againft it, fo as it may make a great
found : this is pretty; if it is cunningly done,
for both the ear and the eye are deceived by
this device.
To convert money into counters,
and counters
into money.
Another way to deceive the lookers on, is
to do as before with a tefter, and keeping a
counter in the palm of your left-hand fecret-
ly, to put the tefter fecretly thereinto, which
being retained ftill in the right-hand, when
the left-hand is opened, the tefter will feem
to be turned into a counter.
To put one tefter into one hand,
another into the
other hand, and with words to bring them
together.
He that hath once attained to the faculty
of retaining one piece of money in his right-
hand, may fhew a hundred pleafant conceits

by that means, and may referve two or three
as well as one; and fo then you may feem to
put one piece into your left-hand, and retain-
ing it ftill in your right-hand, you may toge-
ther therewith take up another like piece,
and fo with words feem to bring both pieces
together. Variety of tricks may be fhewn in
juggling with money.
To put one tefler into a firanger's hand,
and
another into your own,
and to convey both in-
to theftrangers hand with words.
Alfo you may take two tellers evenly fet
together, and put the fame inftead of one tef-
ter into a ftranger’s hand, and then making
as though you did put one teller into your
left-hand with words, you lhall make it feem
that you convey the teller in your hand into
the ftranger’s hand, for when you open your
faid left-hand, there Lhall be nothing feen, and
he opening his hand, lhall find two tellers,
which he thought was but one. By this de-
vice, I fay a hundred conceits may be fhewed.

ting your thumb upon it, you fhall eafily with
a little pradtice, convey the edge betwixt the
middle and fore-finger ;
whilft you proffer to
put it into the other hand, provided always
that the edge appears not through the fing-
ers on the backfide, which being done, take
up another tefter, which you may caufe ano-
ther ftander-by to lay down, and put them
both together, either clofely, inftead of one
into a ftranger’s hand, or keep them ftill in
your own hand, and after fome words fpoken
open your hands, and there being nothing in
one hand, and both pieces in the other, the
beholders will wonder how they came toge-
ther.
To throw a piece of money azuay,
and to find it
again where you left it.
You may with the middle or ring-finger of
the right hand, convey a tefter into the palm
with the fame hand, and feem to call it away,
keeping it ftill, which with confederacy will
feem ftrange : to wit, when you find it again,
where another have beftowed the like piece,
but thefe things without exercife cannot be
done therefore I will proceed to fhew how
things may be brought to pafs with lefs diffi-
culty, and yet as ftrange as the reft, being
unknown, are marvelloufly commended, but
being known are derided and nothing at all

How to make a groat or tejler to leap out of a
pot,
or run along upon a table.
You fhall fee a juggler take a tefter and
throw it into a pot, or lay it in the midft of a
table, and with enchanting words caufe the
fame to leap out of the pot, or run towards
him, or from him along the table, which will
feem miraculous until you know how it is
done ;
which is thus, take a long black hair
of a woman’s head faftened to the rim of a
tefter, by the means of a little hole driven
through the fame with a Spanifh needle, in
like fort you may ufe a knife, or any fmall
thing, but if you would have it go from you,
you muft have a confederate, by which means
all juggling is graced and amended ;
this feat
is the ftranger if it be done by night, a can-
dle placed between the fpedtators and the
juggler, for by that means their eyes are hin-
dered from difeerning the conceit.
To make a groat or a tejler to fink through a
table,
and to vanifh out of a handkerchief
ftrangely.
A juggler alfo will fometimes borrow a tef-
ter and mark it before you, and feem to put
the fame into the midft of a handkerchief,
and wind it fo as you may the better fee and
feel it ;
then will he take the handkerchief
and
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 33
and bid you feel whether the teller be there
or not, and he will alfo require you to put
the fame under a candleftick, or fome fuch
like thing ;
then he will fend for a bafon of
water, and holding the fame under the table
right againft the candleftick, he will ufe cer-
tain words of enchantment, and in fhort you
will hear the teller fall into a bafon ;
this
done, let one take off the candleftick, and
the juggler take the handkerchief by a toffel
and fliake it, but the money is gone, which
feemeth as ftrange a feat as any whatfoever,
but being known, the miracle is turned to a
bauble, for it is nothing elfe but to few a tef-
ter into a corner of a handkerchief, finely
covered with a piece of linen a little bigger
than your teller, which corner you muft con-
vey inftead of the teller delivered to you into
the middle of your handkerchief, leaving the
other in your hand or lap, which afterwards
you feem to pull through the table, letting it
fall into the bafon.
A notable trick to transform a counter to a
groat.
Take a groat, or fome leffer piece of mo-
ney, and grind it very thin at one fide, and
take two counters and grind them, the one at
one fide, glew the fmooth fide of the groat
to the fmooth fide of the counter, joining
them fo clofe together as may be, efpecially
at
34 The Art of Legerdemain;
at the edges, which may be fo filled as they
fhall feem to be but one piece, to wit, one
fide a counter and the other fide a groat, then
take a little green wax, for that is fofteft, and
therefore beft, and lay it fo upon the fmooth
fide of the counter as if it do not much dif-
colour the groat, and fo will that counter
with the groat cleave together as though they
were glewed, and being filled even with the
groat and the other counter, it will feem fo
perfect like an entire counter, that though a
ftranger handle it he cannot betray it ;
then
having a little touched your fore-finger and
the thumb of your right-hand with foft wax,
take therewith this counterfeit counter, and
lay it openly upon the palm of your left-hand,
in fuch fort as if you were to lay down the
counter, wringing the fame hard, fo as you
may leave the glewed counter with the groat
apparently in the palm of your left-hand, and
the fmooth fide of the waxed counter will
flick faft upon your thumb, by reafon of the
wax wherewith it is fmeared, and fo you
may hide it at your pleafure always, that you
lay the waxed fide downward and the glewed
fide upward, then clofe your hand, and in,
or after the clofing thereof, turn the piece,
and fo inftead of a counter, which they fup-
pofe to be in your hand, you fhall feem to
have a groat, to the aftonifhment of the be-
holders, if it be well handled. The juggler
muft not have any of his tricks wanting.

An excellent feat to make a two penny piece be
plain in the palm ofyour hand, and be paffed
fro7n thence where you lift.
Put a little red wax, not too much, upon
the nail of your longeft finger, then let a
ftranger put a two-penny piece into the palm
of your hand, and fhut your fift fuddenly,
and convey the two-penny piece upon the
wax, which with ufe you may fo accomplifh
as no man fhall perceive it ;
then, and in the
mean time ufe words of courfe, and fuddenly
open your hand, hold the tips of your fin-
gers rather lower than higher than the palm
of your hand, and the beholders will wonder
where it is gone ;
then fhut your hand fud-
denly again, and lay a wager whether it be
there or not, and you may either leave it
there, or take it away at pleafure; this, if it
be well handled, hath more admiration than
any other feat of the hand. Note, This may
be beft done by putting the wax upon the
two-penny piece, but then you muft put it
into your hand yourfelf.
To convey a tefier out of one's hand that holds
it fafl.
Stick a little wax upon your thumb, and
take a ftander-by, by the fingers, fhewing
him the teller, and telling him you will put
the fame into his hand, then wring it down
hard with your waxed thumb, and ufing ma-
ny

ny words, look him in the face, and as foon
as you perceive him to look in your face, or
on your hand, fuddenly take away your
thumb and clofe his hand, and it will feem to
him that the teller remaineth; even as if you
wring a teller upon one’s forehead, it will
feem to Hick when it is taken away, efpecially
if it be wet; then caufe him to hold his hand
Hill, and with fpeed put into another man’s
hand, or into your own, two tellers inftead
of one, and ufe words of courfe, whereby
you lhall make the beholders believe, when
they open their hands, that by enchantment
you have brought both together.
To convey a flatting,
being in one hand’
into a-
nother,
holdingyour hands abroad.
It is neceffary to mingle fome merry pranks
among your grave miracles, as in this cafe of
money, to take a Ihilling in each hand, and
holding your arms abroad, lay a wager that
you will put them both into one hand with-
out bringing them any nearer together ;
the
wager being laid, hold your arms abroad like
a rod, and turning about with your body,
lay the Ihilling out of one of your hands up-
on the table, and turning to the other hand,
and fo you lhall win your wager : a knack
more merry than marvellous.
To transformanyfmatt thing into anyotherform
by folding paper.
Take a Iheet of paper, and fold or double

the fame, fo as one fide be a little longer than
the other, then put a counter between the
two Tides of the leaves of the paper, up to
the middle of the top of the fold, hold the
fame fo as it be not perceived, and lay a groat
on the outfide thereof, right againft the coun-
ter, and fold it down to the end of the lon-
ger fide, and when you have unfolded it a-
gain, the groat will be where the counter
was; fo that fome will fuppofe that you have
transformed the money into a counter ;
and
with this many tricks may be done.
Another experiment of the like nature.
Take two papers, three inches fquare a-
piece, divided into two folds, into three equal
parts, at either fide, fo as each folded paper
remains one inch fquare ;
then glew the back
fide of the two together, as they are folded,
and not as they are opened, and fo fhall both
papers feem to be but one, and which fide
foever you open, it fhall appear to be the
fame, if you have handfomely the bottom,
as you may well do with your middle finger,
fo as if you have a groat in one hand, and a
counter in the other, you having fhewed but
one, may by turning the paper, feem to
change it ;
this may be beft performed by
putting it under a candleftick or a hat, and
with words feem to do the feat. This is no
inferior trick.
D Of
38 The Art of Legerdemain ;
Of cards,
with good caution how to avoid co-
zenage therein,
efpecially rules to convey and
handle the cards,
and the manner and order
how to accomplifh all difficulties andflrange
things wrought with cards.
I having now beftowed fome wafte money
among you, I will fet you to cards, by which
kind of witchcraft a great number of people
have juggled away, not only their money, but
alfo their lands, their health, their time, and
their honefty. I dare not as I could, fhew
the lewd juggling that cheats pra6tice, leaft it
minifter fome offence to the well difpofed, to
the fimple hurt and Ioffes, and to the wicked
occafion of evil doing ;
but I could wifh all
gamefters to beware, not only of cards, but
alfo of what dice they play withal ;
but e-
fpecially with whom, and where they exercife
gaming, and to let dice pafs as a thing where-
by a man muft be inevitably cozened : one
that is fkilful in making bum cards, may undo
hundreds of wealthy men, that are given to
gaming ;
for if he hath a confederate prefent,
either of the players or ftanders-by, the mif-
chief cannot be avoided ;
if you play among
ftrangers, beware of him that feems fimple
or drunken, for under their habit the moft
fpecious cozeners are prefented, and while
you think by their fimplicity and imperfec-
tions to beguile them, and thereby perchance
are perfuaded by their confederates, which
you
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 39
you take to be your friends, you will be then
moft of all deceived : beware alfo of the bet-
ters and lookers on, and particularly, of them
that bet on your fide, whilft they look on
your game, without fufpicion, they difcover
it by figns to your adverfaries, with whom
they bet, and yet are their confederates.
But in fhewing feats and juggling with
cards, the principal point conflfteth in the
fhuffling them nimbly, and always keeping one
card either at the bottom or in fome known
place of the ftock, four or five cards from it
;
hereby you fhall feem to work wonders, for
it will be eafy for you to fee one card, which
though you be perceived to do, it will not
be fufpedted, if you fhuffle them well after-
wards : and this note I muft give you, that
in referving the bottom card, you muft always
whilft you fhuffle, keep him a little before or
a little behind all the cards lying underneath
him, beftowing him, I fay, either a little be-
yond his fellows before, right over the fore-
finger or elfe behind the reft, fo as the little
finger of the left hand may meet with it,
which is the eafier, the readier, and better
way in the beginning of your fhuffling, fhuf-
fle as thick as you can, and in the end throw
upon the ftock the nether card, with fo ma-
ny more at the leaft as you would have pre-
ferved for any purpofe, a little before or a
little behind the reft, provided always that
your fore-finger (if the pack lay behind) creep
D 2 up
40 The Art 0/ Legerdemain ;
up to meet with the bottom card, and when
you fell it, you may then hold it until you
have lhuffled over the cards again, ftill leav-
ing your kept card below : being perfedt
herein, you may do almoft what you lift with
cards by this means, what pack foever you
ufe, though it confifteth of eight, twelve, or
twenty cards, you may keep them ftill toge-
ther unferved next to the card, and yet fhuf-
fle them often to fatisfy the curious behold-
ers. As for example, and for brevity fake,
to fhew divers feats under one.
How to deliver out four aces,
and to convert
them into four knaves.
Make a pack of thefe eight cards, to wit,
four knaves and four aces, and although the
eight cards muft be immediately together, yet
muft each knave and ace be evenly fet toge-
ther, and the fame eight cards muft lye alfo
in the loweft place of the bunch, then fhuffle
them fo always at the fecond fhuffling or at
leaftwife at the end of your fhuffling the faid
pack, one ace may lay undermoft, or fo as
you may know where he goeth and lieth al-
ways : I fay, let your aforefaid pack, with
three or four cards more, lye unfeparable to-
gether; immediately upon, and with that ace;
then ufmg fome fpeck, or other device, and
putting your hands with the cards to the edge
of the table to hide the adtion, let out pri-
vately a piece of the fecond card, which is
one
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 41
one of the knaves, holding forth the flock
in both your hands, and fhewing to the ftan-
ders-by, the nether card, which is the ace
or kept card, covering alfo the head or piece
of the knave, which is the next card, and with
your fore-finger draw out the fame knave,
laying it down on the table ;
then fhuffle
them again, keep your pack whole, and
fo have your two aces lying together in the
bottom ;
and to reform that difordered card,
and alfo to grace and countenance that adlion,
take off the uppermoft card of the bunch,
and thrufl it into the midfl of the cards, and
then take away the nethermoft card which
is one of your faid aces, and bellow him like-
wife ;
then may you being as before, fhewing
another ace, and inflead thereof lay down a-
nother knave, and fo forth, until inflead of
your aces you have laid down four knaves,,
the beholders all this while thinking that
there lies four aces on the table are greatly
amufed, and will marvel at the transformation
;
you mufl be well advifed in fhuffling of the
bunch left you over-fhoot yourfelf.
How to tell one what card he feeth at the bot-
toms when the card is Jhuffled in the Jlock.
When you have feen a card privately, or
as though you marked it not, lay the fame
undermofl, and fhuffle the cards as before
you are taught, till your card be again at the
bottom ;
then fhew the fame to the beholders,
D 3 bid-
42 The Art of Legerdemain;
bidding them to remember it; then fhuffle the
cards, or let any other fhuffle them, for you
know the card already, and therefore may at
any time tell them what card they faw, which
neverthelefs muft be done with caution, or
fhew of difficulty.
Another way to do the fame,
having yourfelf
neverfeen the cards.
If you can fee no card, or be fufpefted to
have feen that which you mean to fhew, then
let a ftander-by fhuffle, and afterwards take
you the cards into your hands, and having
fhewed them, and not feen the bottom card,
fhuffle again, and keep the fame cards, as
before you are taught ;
and either make fhift
then to fee it when their fufpicion is paft,
which may be done by letting fome cards fall,
or elfe lay down all the cards in heaps, re-
membring where you laid the bottom card ;
then efpy how many cards lie in fome one
heap, and lap the flap where your bottom
card is, upon that heap, and all the other
heaps upon the fame, and fo if there were
five cards in the heap, whereon you laid
your card, then the fame muft be the fixth
card, which now you muft throw out or look
upon without fufpicion, and tell them the
card they faw.
To tell without confederacy,
what card he
thinketh on.
Lay three cards at a little diftance, and bid

a ftander-by be true and not waver, but think
on one of the three, and by his eye you fhall
affuredly perceive which he thinketh : and
you fhall do the like if you caft down a whole
pack of cards with the faces upwards, where-
of there will be few or none plainly perceiv-
ed, and they alfo court cards : but as you
caft them down fuddenly, fo muft you take
them up prefently, marking both his eyes, and
the card whereon he looketh.

How to make a cardjump out of the pack, and
run on the table.
This is a wonderful fancy if it be well
handled : as thus,
Take a pack of cards and let any one draw
any card that they fancy beft, and afterward
take and put it into the pack, but fo as you
know where to find it at pleafure : for by
this time, I fuppofe you know how to fhuffle
the cards, and where to find any card when
it is put into the pack ;
then take a piece of
wax, and put it under the thumb nail of your
hand, and then fatten a hair to your thumb,
and the other end of the hair to the card,
then fpread the pack of cards open on the
table, then fay, “If you are a pure virgin
the card will jump out of the pack,” then
by your words or charms feem to make it
jump on the table.

Hoiv to tell zvhat card any man thinketh o?i, and
how to convey the fame into a kernal of a nut
or cherry fone,
and the fame again into one's
pocket; and how to make him draw the fame
or any cardyoupleafe,
andall under one device.
Take a nut, or a cherry ftone ;
and burn
a hole through the fide of the top of the
fhell, and alfo through the kernal if you will,
with a hot bodkin, or bore it with an awl,
and with a needle pull out the kernal, fo as
the fame may be as wide as the hole of the
fhell : then write the name of the card in a
piece of fine paper, and roll it up hard, then
put it into the nut or cherry ftone, and ftop
the hole up with wax, and rub the fame over
with a little duft, and it will not be perceiv-
ed ;
then let fome ftander-by draw a card,
faying,
c
It is no matter what card you draw;’
and if your hands fo ferve you to ufe the
card well, you fliall proffer him, and he fhall
receive the fame card that you have rolled up
in the nut ;
then take another nut and fill it
up with ink, and then ftop the hole up with
wax, and then give that nut which is filled
with ink to fomebody to crack, and when he
finds the ink come out of his mouth, it will
caufe great laughter. By this feat on the
cards, great wonders might be done.
How to let twenty gentlemen draw twenty cards,
and to make one card every man's card.
Take a pack of cards, let any gentleman
draw
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 45
draw a card, and let him put it in the pack
again, but be fure that you know where to
find it again at pleafure; then fhuffle the cards
as before taught, and then let another gentle-
man draw a card, but be fure that you let him
draw no other but the fame card as the other
did draw, and fo do till ten or twelve or as ma-
ny cards as you think fit ;
when you have fo
done, let another gentleman draw another card,
but not the fame, and put that card into the
pack where you have kept the other card, and
fhuffle them till you have brought both the
cards together ;
then fhewing the laft card to
the company, the other will fhew the trick.
By this means many other feats may be done.
How to change a pack of cards into all manner

46 The Art of Legerdemain;
You muft take a pack of cards and paint
upon the back fide of one half of the pack
what manner of figures that pleafe your fancy
beft, as men, women, birds, flowers, &c.
Then paint the other half of the cards, viz.
on that fide where the fpots are on, after the
fame manner you did the other half, fo be-
tween them both you will have a compleat
pack of all pi6tures ;
and when you will per-
form this trick, you muft fliew the cards but
half-way. This is one of the beft tricks on
the cards ;
and you may have them ready
made at my houfe.
How to knit a knot upon a handkerchief\
and
to undo the fame with words.
Make one plain loofe knot with the two
corner ends of a handkerchief, with feeming
to draw the fame very hard, hold faft the bo-
dy of the faid handkerchief near to the knot
with your right hand, pulling the contrary
end with your left hand, which is the corner
of that which you hold ;
then clofe up hand-
fomely the knot, which will be fomewhat
loofe, and pull the handkerchief fo with your
right hand as the left hand end may be near
to the knot, then will it feem to be a true
and firm knot ;
and to make it appear more
affuredly to be fo, let a ftranger pull at the
end which you have in your left hand, while
you hold faft the other in your right hand,
and then holding the knot with your fore-fin-
ger
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 47
ger and thumb, and the lower part of your
handkerchief with your other finger, as you
hold a bridle, when you would with one hand
flip up the knot and lengthen the reins ;
this
done, turn your handkerchief over the knot
with the left hand, in doing whereof you
muft fuddenly flip out the end or corner, put-
ting up the knot of your handkerchief with
your fore-finger and thumb, as you would
put up the aforefaid knot of your bridle
:
then deliver the fame covered and wrapt
within the midft of the handkerchief to one
to hold fait, and after pronouncing fome
words of art, take the handkerchief and fhake
it, and it will be loofe.
Hoiv to take three button moulds off tzvo firings.
Take two little whipcords of two feet long
a piece, double them equally fo as there may
appear four ends ;
then take three button
moulds the hole of one of them muft be
bigger than the reft, and put one button
mould upon the eye or bout of the one cord
and
48 The Art 0/ Legerdemain
;
and another on the other cord, then take the
button mould with the greateft hole, and let
both the bouts be hidden therein ;
which
may be the better done if you put the eye or
bout of the one into the eye or bout of the
other ;
then pull the middle button upon the
fame being doubled over his fellow, fo will
the heads feem to be put over the two cords,
you may loofe them as you lift, and make it
feem manifeft to the beholders, which may not
fee how they are done, but that the buttons
are put upon the two cords without any fraud
;
then muft you feem to add a more effedtual
binding of thofe buttons to the firings, and
make one half of a knot with one of the ends
of each fide, which is for no other purpofe,
but that when the buttons be taken away, the
cords may be feen in the cafe, which the be-
holders fuppofes them to be in before, for
when you have made your half knots, which
in any wife you may not double to make a
perfect knot, you muft deliver into the hands
of fome ftander-by thefe two cords, namely
two cords evenly fet to one hand, and two in
the other, and then with a wager being to
pull off the buttons, which if you handle nim-
bly, and in the end caufe him to pull his two
ends, the two cords will fhew to be placed
plainly, and the buttons to have come thro’
the cords ;
but thofe things are fo hard, and
long to be defcribed, that I will leave them,
whereas I could fhew greater variety.

fait, puts it into a piece of paper, then fays
he, ‘
Hold this to your cheek on that fide the

your head at him, afking him, if he can find
none to make fport with but you that are not

he then proffers you to try his re-
ceipt, which with feeming unwillingnefs take
and hold it to your cheek a fmall time, then
he will afk you if you find eafe, you fpitting

Yes truly I find it much abated ;’
then he will fay, ‘

then he coming in, takes up the paper again,
and puts it into his mouth as before, (the
company will be laughing and fleering as tho’
you are ignorant,) then privately convey the
afhes away with the paper and another paper
of fait like the former, as you muft have in
readinefs as before, hold to your cheek, your

To blow if it be a head or woman, and the

What is it

and pile in filver is done the fame way. By
confederacy divers ftrange things are done
;
as to make a man, by muttering fome words
to pull off his. clothes, and fo dance naked:
thus you may throw a piece of money into a
pond, and bid a boy go to fuch a fecret place
where you have hid it, and he will bring it,
and make them believe it is the fame that
you threw into the pond, and no other.
So let a confederate take a fhilling and put
it under a candleftick on a table at a good
diftance from you, then you muft fay, ‘

it turned hollow throughout, fo that you may
have a fcrew made juft fit, and then put a
needle at each end of the fcrew, and have
two holes fo contrived in the poft that you
may faften two firings in the fcrew, fo as
when you pull one end of the firing, the
needle will run into your finger, and when you

intend to cut, then drawing hollow by the
falfe piece, caufe it to be cut off and gripping

The Egg Box is look'd upon to be as good a

;
P, the lower part of the fhell-box; putting
B, which is the outward fhell, upon C, and
both upon P, as it (lands, makes the box per-
fect. To do this trick, call for an egg, then
bid all ftanders-by look on it, and fee that it
is a real egg, fetting the box on the table,
upon the foot C, take off the upper part, B,
C, with your fore-finger and thumb, then
placing the egg in the box, fay,

How to eat fire,

and fhutting your mouth clofe puts out the
fulphur, and fo they champ the coals and
fwallow them, which they may do without
offending the body; but if they were bound

How to light a candle by a glafs of cold water,

and it will immediately light. This is the
preparation that Cromwell ufed to fire off his
cannon withal, very amazing to behold ;

may write with it on a paper, fome horrible
words or other, and it will appear dreadful
and frightful to the beholders : alfo you may
take a piece as big as a pin’s head, and rub

A trick upon the globe-box.
This is a trick not inferior to the beft that
is (hewn with boxes; it is a box made of four
pieces, and a ball fo big as is imagined to be
contained therein: the ball ferves in the fame

to deceive the hand and eye of the fpedlators.
This ball, made of wood or ivory, is thrown
out of the box upon the table, for every one

to fee that it is fubftantial, then putting the
ball into the box, and letting the ftanders-by
blow on the box, taking off the upper fhell
with your fore-finger and thumb, there ap-
pears another, and of another colour, as red,
blue, yellow, or any variety of colours upon
each ball that is fo imagined to be, which in-
deed is no more than the fhell of wood inge-
nioufly turned and fitted for the box, as you
may fee in the figures above.
L, the out-fhell of the globe taken off
the figures M, N, an inner fhell, O, the co-

made with more or lefs varieties, according
to the defire of the practitioner.
To tell the names of all cards in the pack,

fhuffled them, or let another fhuffle them, lay
them down upon the table before you, with

How to hold four kings in the hand, and by
words to feem to transform them into four
aces,
and afterzvards to make them all blank
cards.
You fhall fee a juggler take four kings in
his hand, and apparently fhew you them, then
after fome words and charms, he will throw
them down upon the table, taking one of the
kings away, and adding but one other card
;
then taking them up again, and blowing upon
them, will fhew you them transformed into
blank cards, white on both fides, then throw-
ing them down as before, with their faces
downwards, will take them up again, and
blowing upon them, will fhew you four aces.
This trick, in my mind, is not inferior to any
of the reft, and being not known, will feem
very ftrange to the beholders, and yet after
you know it, you cannot but fay the trick is
pretty. Now to do this feat, you muft have
cards made for the purpofe, half cards we
may call them ;
that is one half kings and the
other half aces, fo laying the aces one over
the other, nothing but the kings will be feen,
and then turning the kings downwards, the
four aces will be feen; but you muft have
F 2 two
64 The Art of Legerdemain ;
two hole cards, one a king, to cover one
of the aces, or elfe it will be perceived; and
the other an ace, to lay over the kings, when
you mean to fhew the aces; then, when you
would make them all blank, lay the cards a
little lower and hide the aces, and they will
appear all white. The like you may make
of four knaves, putting upon them the four
fives; and fo of the other cards.
To tell or name all the cards in the pack,
and
yet neverfee them.
To do this, you mufl firft privately drop a
drop of water or beer about the bignefs of a
two-pence upon the table before you, where
you fit, then reft your elbows upon the table
fo as the cuffs of your fleeves may meet, and
your hands flick up to the brims of your hat;
in this pofture your arms will hide the drop
of water from the company; then let anyone
take the cards and fhuffle them, and put them
into your hands; alfo, let them fet a candle
before you, for this trick is beft done by can-
dle light, then holding the cards in your left-
hand, above the brim of your hat, up clofe
to your head, fo as the light of the candle
may fliine upon the cards, and holding your
head down; fo in the drop of water, like a
looking-glafs, you fhall fee the fhadow of all
the cards before you ;
draw then the fingers
of your right-hand along upon the cards, as
though you felt the fpots, name the cards,
and
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 65
and then lay him down. Thus you may lay
down all the cards in the pack, one by one,
naming them, before you lay them down,
which will feem very ftrange to the beholders
who will think that you have felt them out.
To fhezv one what card he taketh 7iotice of.
Let any man take a card out of the pack,
and note him : then take part of the pack in
your hand, and lay the reft down upon the
table; bidding him lay his noted card upon
them; then turning your back towards the
company, make as though you were looking
over the cards in your hand, and put any card
at the fore-fide; and whilft you are doing this
privately, wait the cards being laid out in
heaps to find what the bottom cards are. Bid
any one take four cards of the fame number,
viz. 4 aces, 4 duces, 4 trays, or 4 fours, or
any other number not exceeding 10, (for he
muft not take court cards) and lay them out;
then take the remaining cards (if any fuch
there be) and divide their number by 4, and
the quotient fhall be the number of fpots the 4
card: if 12 cards remain then on each bottom
card were trays, and if there be no remaining
cards, then the four bottom cards are four
aces.
To tell the number offpots on the bottom cards
,
laid down on feveral heaps.
Bid any one take the whole pack of cards
F 3 in
66 The Art of Legerdemain;
in his hand, and having fhuffled them, let him
take off the upper card, and having taken
notice of it, let him lay it down upon the ta-
ble with his face downwards, and upon it let
him lay fo many cards, as will make up the
number of the fpots on the noted card, 12.
e. g. If the card which the perfon firft took
notice of, were a king, queen or knave, or a
fmgle ten, bid him lay down that card with
his face downwards, calling him ten, upon
that card let him lay another, calling him e-
leven, and upon another, calling him twelve;
then bid him take off the next uppermoft
card, faying, What is it ? Suppofe it were a
9, and laying it down on another part of the
table, calling him 9, upon him lay another
card, calling him 10; and upon him another
calling him 1 1 ;
and upon him another, cal-
ling him 12; then let him look on the next
uppermoft card, and fo let him proceed to lay
them up in heaps, in all refpedts as before,
till he has laid out the whole pack; but if
there be any odd cards at the laft, I mean, if
there is not enough, to make up the laft not-
ed card 12, bid him give them to you; then
to tell him the numbers of all the fpots con-
tained in all the bottom cards of the heaps,
do thus, from the number for heaps fubtrafl
4, and multiply the remainder by 12, and to
the produdl add the numbers of thofe remain-
ing cards, which he gave you, if any remain,
but if there were but four heaps, then thofe
remain-
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 67
remaining cards alone, fliew the number of
fpots fought.
Note, That you ought not to fee the bot-
tom cards of the heaps, nor fhould you fee
them laid out, or know the number of cards
in each heap, it fuffices if you know the num-
ber of heaps, and the number of the remain-
ing cards, if any fuch there be; and therefore
you may as well perform this feat ftanding in
another room as if 'you were prefent, you
muft have a whole pack.
To make any two cards come together, which
any body Jliall name.
When any one has named what two cards
he would have brought together, take the
cards and fay, ‘
Let us fee whether they are
‘
here or not, and if they are, I will put them
‘
as far afunder as I can;' then having found
the two cards propofed, difpofe them in the
pack, and caufe them to come together.
This trick would feem much more ftrange
when you have brought the propofed cards
together, by laying them in heaps, you lay
the heap wherein the propofed cards are at
the bottom of the pack, and then fhufflc the
cards, cut them afunder fomewhere in the
middle, fo the propofed cards will be found
together in the middle of the pack, which will
feem very ftrange to the beholders.

the fellow’s middle, and the other end of the
rope tie to the cat, and then have the rope to

Hozv to burn a thread,
and to make it whole
again with the aflies.
It is not one of the worft tricks to burn a
thread handfomely, and make it whole again,
the manner whereof is this : take two threads,
or fmall laces, of one foot length a piece,
roll up one of them round, which will be
then about the bignefs of a pea, put the fame
between your left fore-finger and your thumb,
then take the other thread, and hold it forth
at length betwixt your fore-finger and thumb
of each hand, holding all your fingers dainti-
ly, as young gentlewomen are taught to hold
up a morfel of meat; then let one cut afunder
the fame thread in the middle; when that is
done, put the tops of your two thumbs toge-
ther, and fo fhall you with lefs fufpicion re-
ceive the piece of thread which you hold in

your right-hand, into your left, without open-
ing of your left-finger and thumb; then hold-
ing thofe two pieces as you did before it was
cut, let thefe two be alfo cut afunder in the
midft, and they conveyed again as before, un-
til they be very fhort, and then roll all thofe
ends together, and keep that ball of thread
before the other in the left hand, and with a
knife thruft the fame into a candle, where you
may hold it until the faid ball of thread be
burnt to afhes ;
then pull back the knife with
your right-hand and leave the afhes with the
other ball betwixt your fore-finger and thumb
of your left hand together, take pains to rub
the allies till your thread be renewed, and
draw out that thread at length which you
had all this while, betwixt your fore-finger
and thumb. This is not inferior to any juggler’s
trick, if it be well handled for if you are fo
perfect in Legerdemain, as to beftow the fame
ball of thread and to change it from place to
place, betwixt your other fingers, as may be
eafily done, then it will feem very ftrange.
To cut a lace afunder in the middle,
and to make

By a device not much unlike the former,
you may feem to cut afunder any lace that
hangs about one’s neck, or any point, girdle
or garter, and with a lham conjuration to make
it whole, and clofe it together again : for the
accomplifhment whereof, provide if you can

a piece of the lace which you mean to cut, or
at leaft a pattern like the fame, one inch and
a half long, and keeping it double privately in
your left hand, betwixt fome of your fingers,
near to the tips thereof, take the other lace
which you mean to cut ftill hanging about
one’s neck, and draw down your faid left hand
to the bught thereof, and putting your own
piece a little before the other, the end or ra-
ther middle whereof, you muft hide betwixt
your fore finger and thumb, make the eye, or

if it be well handled, will feem miraculous.
How to pull innumerable ribbons out of your

As for pulling ribbons out of your mouth,
it is fomewhat a ftale jeft, whereby jugglers
get money from maids by felling laces by the

tom, as faft as they pull out another, and at
the exa6t end of every yard they tie a knot

then knock their
ends and Tides upon the table; fo it will feem
impoffible to find the noted card, yet it may
eafily be done thus: fubtradl the number of
the cards you held in your hand, from 52, the
whole number of the cards in the pack, and
to the remainder add the number of the not-

fo the fame fhall be the number of
the noted card from the top: therefore take

a platter to be purpofely made, and in each
of them to be made holes fit for a body’s
neck, the board muft be made of two planks,
the longer and broader the better, there muft
be left within half a yard of the end of each
plank half a hole, fo as both the planks be-
ing thruft together, there may remain two
holes like to the holes in a pair of flocks,
there muft be made likewife a hole in the
cloth, a platter alfo muft be fet diredtly over
or upon one of them, having a hole in the
middle thereof, of the like quantity, and alfo
a piece cut off the fame, fo big as his neck,
through which his head may be conveyed in-
to the middle of the platter, and then fitting

82 The Art of Legerdemain ;
or kneeling under the board, let the head
only remain upon the board, in the frame;
then to make the fight more dreadful, put a
little brimftone into a chaffing-difh of coals
fetting it before the head of the boy, who
muft gafp two or three times fo as the fmoke
may enter his noftrils and mouth, which is
not unwholefome, and the head prefently will
appear ftark dead, if the boy fet his counte-
nance accordingly, and if a little blood be
fprinkled on his face, the fight will be the
ftranger. This is commonly pradtifed with a
boy inftrudted for that purpofe, who being
familiar and converfant with company, may
be known as well by his face as by his appa-
rel; in the other end of the table, where the
like hole is made, another boy of the bignefs
of the known boy muft be placed, having on
his ufual apparel, he muft lean or lie upon the
board, and muft put his head under the board
through the faid hole, fo as his body fhall
feem to lie on the one end of the board, and
his head fhall lie in a platter in the other end.
There are other things which might be per-
formed in this adtion, the more to aftonifh the
beholders, which becaufe they require long
deferiptions, I omit; as to put about his neck

then take a mouthful of clean water, and a
clean rag, with ground brafil tied clofe in it
the bulk may be no bigger than a fmall nut,
which muft lie betwixt your hind teeth, and
your cheek, then take of the water out of
the glafs into your mouth, and return it into
the glafs that hath the drop of vinegar in it,
which will caufe it to have the perfeft colour
of fack ;
then turn it into your mouth again,
and

and chew your rag of brafil betwixt your

it will have the perfect colour and fmell of
claret; returning the brafil into its former
place, take the liquor into your mouth again,
and prefently fquirt it into the glafs you rub-
bed with allum, and it will have the perfedt
colour of mulberry wine.
To makeJ"port with an egg.
If you are drinking in company, or other-
wife that you are difpofed to make fport, have
ready a penny-worth of quick-filver, in a quill
fealed at both ends with good hard wax, then
caufe an egg to be roafted or boiled, and take
off a fmall bit of the fhell of the narrow end,
then thruft in your quill of quickfilver, and
lay the egg on the ground; you fhall have
fport enough, for it will never leave tumbling
about as long as there is any heat in it.
So likewife if you put quick-filver in a
fheep’s bladder and blow it up, and when
you have a mind to have fport, then go to
the fire and warm the bladder and fling it on
the ground, and it will jump and fkip about
for a long time, and make all the company
laugh, and think the bladder is bewitched.

words is pretty hard, but you may have them
ready made at my houfe. This box muft be
turned
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 95
turned nearly like unto the egg-boxes, fo that
they cannot find out where it opens, and you
muft have a falfe lid to clap on and off, and
on that lid glew fome bird feed ;
fo before you
fhew the box to the company, put a bird in
the box, and then the falfe lid, then fhew the
box to the company, and it will feem to be
full of feed, then fay to the company, ‘
Gen-
‘
tlemen, you fee my box is full of feed;’
which no body can tell to the contrary, then
put your true lid on, faying. ‘Gentlemen, I
‘
will command all the feed out of my box,
‘and command a living bird to appear;’ fo
taking off the covers the bird will appear.
You may be furnifhecl with all manner of in-
ftruments, as cups, Dutch puddings, egg-box-
es, globe boxes, melting-boxes, fixpenny-box-
es, bird-boxes, and bells and bufhels.
How to command a fixpence out of a box.
You muft go and get a box turned of box-
wood, or any other wood which you fancy;
you muft have it turned with two lids, one
muft be a falfe one, and there put a counter,
fo that it may rattle ;
and you muft have a
fmall pegg, or button to your box, to hinder
the counter from jingling, and at the bottom
of the box, which you have neatly turned,
there you muft have a half notch made in
your box, juft fit for a fixpence to come out.
So to perform this feat you muft defire any
body
96 The Art of Legerdemain ;
body to lend you a fixpence, and to mark it
with what they pleafe, then let them put it
into the box themfelves, afterwards then put
the cover on, then by fhaking the box, the
fixpence will come into your hand ;
then you
may difpofe of it as you know how when you
are fhewing your feats. This feat is not in-
ferior to any that is fhewn with boxes.
Note, This box you may have of me rea-
dy made in the new fafhion.
How to callfor any card in the pack.
Take the cards and fhuffle them, or let any
body elfe fhuffle them, or lay down the whole
pack on the table before you, with their fa-
ces downwards, then drawing off the upper
card, fay, ‘
Here I call for the card of good
‘luck;’ and when you have feen what that
card is, which you muft do as privately as you
can, and be fure not to let the company fee
him, then fay, ‘
Here I call for ,’ nam-
ing your card of good luck, and fo take the
next uppermoft card, and then having feen
him, fay, ‘
Here I call for the ,’ naming
the card you took up laft, and fo take off the
next uppermoft card, and thus ftill calling for
the card you laft took up, you may call for as
many as you pleafe; or if you will you may
thus go round the pack, and in the mean time
caufe one to write down the names of the
cards, in the fame order as you call for them,
which
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 97
which they may do in brief, thus by writing
a figure for the number of the fpots, as 1 for
the ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and fo to ten; and
then kn. for knave, q. for queen, and kg. for
king, adding a letter for the fuit, viz. c. for
clubs, f. for fpades, h. for hearts, and d. for
diamonds, e. g. is three or four cards ;
fup-
pofe the three firft cards called for, were the
ace of clubs, the tray of fpades, and the five
of diamonds, they be fet down thus, 1 C
—
3 S— 5 D, and fo of any others having thus
gone round with as many as you pleafe, take
them from the table, faying, ‘
Look now in
‘ your paper, fee which card I call for firft,
‘
which fecond, which third,’ &c. and whilft
he is looking, do you flip the card of good
luck under the bottom of the pack, then hold-
ing the cards with their faces upwards, take
them off one by one, and they will come in
the fame order as you called them, only the
laft card will not be fet down in the paper,
and it muft be pretended he was the card of
good luck.
Another ivay to callfor a card.
Having privately feen the uppermoft card,
lay the cards down in three or four heaps,
but not above, then begin at the heap fartheft
off from you that has the known card on the
top, and fay,
f
Here I call for the ,’ nam-
ing the known card; then go to the next heap
I faying,
98 The Art of Legerdemain ;
faying, ‘
Here I call for the —— naming
the card you took up laft; proceed in the
fame manner, viz. ftill naming the card you
laft took up, till you come to the laft heap,
fo the card you call for firft will come laft;
but here note, you muft keep the cards clofe
that they may not be feen till you have done
calling, and then you muft lay them down
one by one in the fame order as you called
them.
To tell what card any one thinketh on.
Take 21 cards and begin to lay them down,
three in a row, with their faces upwards, then
begin again at the left-hand, and lay one card
upon the firft, and fo go on to the right hand,
and then begin at the left hand again, and fo
go on to the right, do this till you have laid out
the 21 cards in three heaps, but as you are
laying them out, bid any one think on a card,
and when you have laid them all out, afk him
in which heap his card is, then lay the card
in the middle betwixt the other two; then
lay them all out again into three heaps as be-
fore, and as you lay them out, bid him take
notice where his noted card goes ;
when you
have laid them all out, afk him in what heap
it is now, put that heap in the middle as be-
fore, and lay out the cards a third time, bidding
him take notice where his noted card goes,
and put that heap in the middle as before;
then
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 99
then taking the cards with their backs toward
you, take off the uppermoft card, fmelling to
him, reckon him 1, then take off another,
and fmelling to him, reckon him 2, this do
till you come to the eleventh card, for that
will always be the noted card, after the third
time of laying them out, though you fhould
lay them in this manner never fo often; you
muff never lay out the cards lefs than three
times, but as often above as you pleafe. This
trick may be done by any odd number of
cards that may be divided by three.
Another way to tell one ivhat card is noted.
When one has noted a card, take it and
put it at the bottom of the pack, then fhuffle
the cards till it come again to the bottom ;
then
fee what is the bottom card, for it is the not-
ed card, which you may do without being ta-
ken notice of; thus, when you have fhuffled
the cards, turn them with their faces towards
you and knock their ends upon the table, as
though you would knock them level ;
and
whilft you are fo doing, take notice of the
bottom card, which you may do without fuf-
picion, efpecially having fhuffled them before;
then, when you know the card, fhuffle them a-
gain, and give them to any of the company,
and let them fhuffle them, for you know the
card already, and may eafily find it at any
time.
I 2 Hoiu
ioo The Art of Legerdemain ;
How to make a cardjump out of an egg.
To do this wonderful feat, you muft have
two flicks made, both of one bignefs, and
both of a likenefs ;
fo that no perfon can know
the one from the other; one of the flicks muft
be made fo artificially as to conceal a card in
the middle, as thus ;
you muft have one of
your flicks turned hollow quite through, and
then an artificial fpring to throw the card in
the egg at your pleafure; the operation is
thus, Take and peel any card in the pack,
which you pleafe, and fo roll it up, and then
put it into your falfe flick, and there let it be
till you have occafion to make ufe of it; then
take a pack of cards, and let any body draw
a card, but be fure let it be the fame fort of
card that you have in the flick already; then
let them put it in the pack again, and when
you are fhuffling them, let that card fall into
your lap, which the party drew, fo calling
for fome eggs, defire that party that drew the
card, or anyperfon elfe in the company, to choofe
any one of thefe eggs, and when they have
chofen one, afk him if there be any thing
in it, and they will anfwer no ;
then take the
egg in your left hand, and your falfe flick in
your
Or,
Hocus Pocus in Perfection. ioi
your right, and fo break the egg with your
ftick, and then let the fpring go, and the card
will appear in the egg, very amazing to the
beholders; then conceal that ftick and pro-
duce the true one upon the table.
How to make the fountain of command.
You may contrive this fountain of what figure
you will.
Take a veffel A. B. which has two bottoms,
that is clofe on all fides like a drum; through
the middle of it run a long pipe, C. D. fold-
ered to the lower bottom at F, with its two
ends open, C. D. the firft of which C. muft
not quite touch the uppermoft bottom, but
leave a paffage for the water ;
when one has a
mind to fill the veffel A. B. which is done by
turning up the veffel A. B. with its pipe C.
D. fo that the hole D. will then be the up-
permoft, and pouring in the water at D. this
done, ftop up the pipe C. D. with another,
and a very little fmaller pipe E. D. that can
juft enter it, and is fixed in the bottom of a
cafe or cittern that is a little longer than one
of the two bottoms of the veffel A. B. the
two pipes C. D. ought to have, at an equal
height, two apertures or holes I. I. and the
fmalleft D. E. ought to be moveable within
the greater, C. D. that fo you may turn the
fmaller with its cafe G. H. when you will, fill
the two holes I. I. meet farther the veffel A.
I 3 B.
102 The Art of Legerdemain;
B. ought to have feveral little holes in its low-
er bottom, as K. L. for giving egrefs to the
water, and the cafe or receptacle G. H. ought
likewife to have a fmaller vent M. N. for the
water to run out. Now the veffel A. B. be-
ing filled with' water as we directed but now,
and the pipe C. D. being ftopt by the pipe
D. E. which is fuppofed fo thin, that it could
juft fill it without any neceffity-of the extre-
mity E. it reaching to the end C. provided
the other two ends D. D. do but fit : it is
done, I fay turning the veffel again to its firft
pofition, in which it will ftand as in the figure,
the cafe G. H. being its bafe, and being
turned together with its pipe E. till the two
vents I. I. meet and make but one orifice, for
then the water, contained in the veffel A. B.
will run out at the vents K. L. as long as the
air can pafs through the aperture I. to fup-
ply the room of the water that runs A. B. in-
to the cafe G. H. but when the water in the
receptacle G. H. rifes above the vent I. which
will infallibly happen, fmce more water runs
at the vents K. L. than at M. N. the former
being fuppofed to be larger than the latter,
the air not finding accefs at I. the water in
the veffel A. B. will give over running thro’
the vents K. L. but the water in the recepta-
cle G. H. will continue to run at the vents
M. N. fo that this water will grow lower by
degrees, till the vent I. is uncovered again,
and then the air having accefs at I. will renew
the
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 103
the flux of the water through K. L. which in
a fmall time will raife the water in the cafe G.
H. fo as to recover the vent I. again, upon
which the ftream A. B. will flop, and fo on
alternately, till there is no water in the veffel
A. B.
This is called the fountain of command,
becaufe it runs at a word, when the water is
near the renewal of its flux, through the vents
K. L. which is eaflly known; for when the
vent I. begins to get clear of water in G. A.
the air, ftruggling for accefs at the vent, makes
a little noife, and fo gives notice that the foun-
tain is about to run. This is a merry device.
To feem to kill a horfe, and to cure him again.
Take the feed of henbane, and give it the
horfe in his provender, and it will caft him
into fuch a deep fleep that he will feem dead;
and if you will recover him again, rub his
noftrils with vinegar and he will be revived a-
gain.
A very Jlrange trick,
whereby you may feem to
cut a piece of tape into four parts,
and make
it zvhole again with words.
Take a piece of narrow white tape, about
two or three yards long, firft prefent it to view
to any that may defire it; then tie both the
ends of it together, and take one fide of it in
one
104 The Art 0/ Legerdemain ;
one hand, and the other in the other hand fo
that the knot may be about the midft of one
fide, and ufing fome circumftantial words to
beguile your fpedtators, turn one hand about
toward yourfelf, and the other from you, fo
fhall you twift the tape once; then clap the
ends together, and then if you flip your fore-
finger and thumb of each hand between the
tape, almoft as one would hold a fkane of
thread to be wound, this will make one fold
or twift, as appears where A fignifieth the
twift or fold; B the knot; then in like man-
ner
Or,
Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 105
ner make a fecond fold, about the line D. C.
as you may fee by the fecond figure, where
B. fignifieth the knot, C. the firft fold, A. the
fecond fold : hold then the fore-finger and
thumb of your left hand upon the fecond twift
and upon the knot alfo, and the fore-finger
and thumb of your right hand upon the firft
fold C, and defire fome one of your fpedtators
•
to cut all afunder with a fharp knife, at the
crofs line E. D. when it is cut, hold ftill your
left hand, and let all your ends fall, that you
hold in your right hand, for there will be a
fhew of eight ends, four above and four be-
low, and fo the firings will be thought to be
cut into four parts, as may be feen by the
third figure; then gather up the ends that
you let fall into your left-hand, and deliver
two of the ends, (feeming to take them at
random) unto two feveral perfons, bidding
them to hold them fall, ftill keeping your left
hand fingers upon the twifls or folds; then
with your right hand and left hand feem to
tumble all the ends together that you had in
your left-hand, twift out the flips or pieces,
which are three, as you may fee at A. and
B. in the third figure, twift them all I fay, in-
to a little ball, and conceal it between fome
of the fingers of your left-hand, and crum-
ble thereon another confufed heap, and after
fome words faid, with your right hand deliver
this confufed heap unto any one of the com-
pany, bidding him hold it faft, Hulla Paffa,
then
io6 The Art of Legerdemain;
then bid them look on it, who while they are
greedily looking after the event, you with eafe
convey the ball or roll of ends into your poc-
ket; fo it will be thought that you have made
it whole by virtue of your words. An excel-
lent trick if it be gracefully handled; and a
trick that coft me trouble to find.
A device to multiply one face and make it feem
to be a hundred or a thoufand.
This feat muft be performed by a looking-
glafs made on purpofe, the figure whereof I
have fully defcribed, with the manner of ma-
king it, which is this ;
firft make a hoop, or
fillet of wood, horn, or fuch like, about the
width of a half crown piece in the circumfe-
rence; the thicknefs of this hoop, or fillet,
let it be about a quarter of an inch; in the
middle of this hoop fatten a bottom of wood
or brafs, and bore, in a decent order, diverfe
fmall holes, about the bignefs of fmall peafe,
then open the one fide of this bottom, let in a
piece
Or, Hocus Pocus in Perfection. 107
piece of cryftal-glafs, and faften it in the hoop
clofe to the bottom, then take a quantity of
quick-filver, and put fo much into the hoop as
will cover the bottom ;
then let into the hoop
another piece of cryftal-glafs fitted thereto
and cement the fides, that the quick-filver may
not run out, and it is done; the figure where-
of I have before fet. A. prefenteth the one
fide that giveth the form of one face to the
beholders ? B the other fide that multiplieth
the beholders face fo oft as there are holes in
the middle bottom. The ufe whereof I fhall
not infift upon, fince he that is verfed in the
former feats will better conceive of himfelf to
ufe it, than my words can either diredt or af-
fift him.
To make thefulminating or thunderingpowder.
Take three parts of falt-petre, two parts of
fait of tartar, and one part of fulphur, pound-
ed and mixed together, heat in a fpoon fix-
ty grains of this compofition, and it will fly a-
way with a fearful noife, like thunder, as loud
as a cannon, breaking through the fpoon
and every thing underneath it, for it exerts
itfelf downwards, contrary to the nature of
gun-powder.
I have here fet down, KIND READER,
not only all ufual feats, that either myfelf
have feen or heard of, but divers others alfo,
which
io8 The Art of Legerdemain ;
which I am fure were never in print, nor as
yet performed by any I could ever hear of ex-
cept myfelf, and all to give thee thy full con-
tent; and note this from me, if thou rightly
underhand this, there is not a trick that any
juggler in the world can fliew thee, but thou
fhalt be able to conceive after what manner it
is performed.
