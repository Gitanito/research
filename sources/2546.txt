INTRODUCTION
fit/ C. A. George Newmann
That Dariel Fitzkee has decided to publish a new, enlarged editiorygifB1
of his excellent monograph is welcome news indeed, as there is a
decided dearth of reliable information on a subject that should be
of interest to every enterprising entertainer who is on the alert for
something impressive that he can do at a moment's notice anywhere,
at any time, without special paraphernalia or preparation before a
co-operative audience of one or more persons.
In these particulars contact mind reading meets all requirements.
Moreover it is the only known method which enables the per
former to directly "read" or interpret the unspoken thoughts of
another without resorting to such commonplace conjuring jives as
codes, substitutions, chemicals, transparencies and the like. And
whether one regards the successful performance of such feats as due to
involuntary muscular action, or an interpretation of more subtle
nerve vibrations, is immaterial. The significant fact is this . . .
it is the only method of apparent thought transmission which is
truly psycho-physical in character, hence it is the closest approach
to telepathy as yet known.
It is good to know, but not at all strange, that so keenly analytical
a writer as Mr. Fitzkee should realize the value of contact mind
reading to performers of vision and versatility. What is more, his
treatise will serve to perpetuate this amazing art as first exhibited
by John Randall Brown, the father of contact mind reading. To
Brown its originator and greatest exponent, all succeeding demon
strators are eternally indebted, and any effort to shift the. credit of
priority from Brown to any later exponent can only be regarded
as a falsification of the history of contact mind reading.
In addition to being the only practical manual on the subject that
has appeared in the last three decades, Mr. Fitzkee's new edition will
doubtless do much toward keeping the historical record straight,
and so it affords me both pleasure and satisfaction to commend it
to all serious students.

PREFACE
It was in 1873 that John Randall Brown, the originator of con
tact mind reading, gave an impromptu demonstration of this phase
of mental work which resulted in publicity that led him to world
wide fame in this field. But Brown had been doing this sort of
experiment for years, having discovered it when he was but a boy.
Washington Irving Bishop, while an assistant to Brown, dis
covered the secret and left Brown, ultimately to make a reputation
for himself in this field. Another assistant, Charles Garner, also
discovered the secret while in Brown's employ and also became
famous under the name of Stuart Cumberland.
Through the years there have been many practitioners of contact
mind reading, including Andrew Seymour, Paul Alexander John
stone and others. Among women, Lucy de Gentry and Maud Lan
caster became prominent. Of recent years Dunninger, Polgar, Hell-
strom and others, including C. A. George Newmann, have attained
reputations in this field.
Since the publication of the first edition of CONTACT MIND
READING in 1935, the term "Hellstromism" has been used to
describe contact mind reading by at least two writers. While Hell-
stroin was a successful demonstrator of contact mind reading, he was
no better than many other contemporary performers, and he added
no new phase to this type of work. The term "Hellstromism" is
no more descriptive of contact mind reading than "Bishopism,"
which was Washington Irving Bishop's- description of his methods
as far back as 1887.
To my surprise, well-informed magical acquaintances have told
me, at various times, that they doubted whether contact mind read
ing actually could be performed by the methods described in this
work. Their doubt was so great that they never even attempted it.
Let me assure you that contact mind reading can be performed —
and successfully —by using these methods. While it is true that
some experimenters fail because they are just not fitted for this type
of work psychologically, by far the great bulk of people who try
it are successful. Their degrees of success, however, like degrees of
success in other lines of endeavor, are directly proportionate to their
expertness, talent and adaptibility.
Thoroughly understand these instructions. Understand the under
lying reasons for these, as Mr. Newmann calls them, "psycho
physical" phenomena. Then conscientiously try contact mind read
ing. You are almost certain to succeed.

CHAPTER ONE
Probably the nearest thing to genuine mind reading, within the
talents and training of the average magician, is contact mind reading.
For years it has been known popularly as "muscle reading."
Probably because successful performance is entirely dependent
upon extremely subtle principles, the general run of magicians seem
to make no attempt to incorporate it in their repertoires. Yet it is
not nearly as difficult as it seems. Many of the more simple tests,
tremend'ously effective in their impacts under the proper conditions,
are well within the scope of performers of extremely limited experi
ence.
Because these elementary tests provide the experience and train
ing necessary for the more involved demonstrations, contact mind
reading is a field of extremely fruitful endeavor magically.
In BEHIND THE SCENES WITH MEDIUMS by David P.
Abbott, in THE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA OF SPIRITUAL
ISM by Hereward Carrington, in ELLIOTT'S LAST LEGACY,
in Burlingame's HOW TO READ PEOPLE'S MINDS, and in some
minor references, may be found allusion to a system of mind reading
called "muscle reading. Varying in degree of detail and clarity of
explanation, even the methods of operation are revealed.
Yet for some reason, perhaps because, as I have pointed out
before, the principles may seem too subtle, only occasionally may
demonstrations be witnessed.
But contact mind reading, a term urged by Mr. C. A. G. New-
mann as more truly describing this type of work, fits ideally into all
types of mental demonstrations. Performers will do billet tests,
book tests, living and dead tests, and many other pseudo-psychic
and pseudo-spiritualistic effects without attempting anything in the
contact mind reading field.
It should be realized, I feel, that contact mind reading is perhaps
the nearest thing to genuine mind reading at present available to
mental performers. Actually, of course, non-contact mind reading
more closely approaches genuine phenomena. But reliable informa
tion is extremely scarce in the non-contact realm. There are few
successful non-contact demonstrators. Mr. Newmann is generally
conceded as being the most successful of the non-contact performers,
and he has not revealed his methods at this date.
CONTACT MIND READING— EXPANDED
\
Any attempt at discussing the methods of non-contact operators,
without the experience and knowledge acquired in a career as exten
sive as Mr. Newmann's, must almost inevitably result in failure—
failure to explain, failure to teach and, certainly, failure to acquire
the ability to demonstrate it successfully.
I am not a non-contact operator. While I have theories in this
regard, they are only theories. I have never succeeded in proving to
my own satisfaction that I can accomplish certain and positive
results.
I do feel, however, that extensive experience in the contact field
is the stepping stone to non-contact success.
So since I am not a non-contact operator, do not expect to find
non-contact methods here. Frankly, the contact field is big enough
for this present discussion.
First of all, let me assure you that contact mind reading is prac
tical. It positively will work. Do not let unfamiliarity with the
extremely subtle clues frighten you. Do not let a lack of confidence
in your ability to interpret these clues keep you from attempting it.
Try it. Try it first among close friends, friends you may be able
to interest from the viewpoint of interesting experiment.
If you fail in your first attempts, keep at it. Even if your results
are unconvincing in the beginning, if you have the proper tempera
ment, if you have the intelligence, if you have proper nervous acute-
ness, in an astonishingly short time you will actually be performing
these effects. But it will be necessary for you to do some experiment
ing so that you can recognize the clues when they come to you. I
urge you to give it a fair trial.
The field is made possible by a curious psycho-physical—the
word is Mr. Newmann's —phenomenon. Psychic, because its origin
is in the mind. Physical, because it manifests itself physically.
Psychologists know that deep concentration usually results in
some subconscious physical reaction. Contact mind reading is made
possible through the operator's interpretation of these physical clues,
sometimes extremely subtle but almost invariably unmistakable. These
clues come from a spectator-transmitter, by no means a confederate,
who is asked to concentrate upon the task which has been selected
for the performer-receiver. Usually these tasks, or tests, are selected
as the result of agreement among the spectators. The transmitter, one
of the spectators, who knows exactly what is required of the per
former, is selected to mentally guide the performer.
10
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
The fundamental requirement of this transmitter is that he con
centrate on what is required, step by step. As the result of the trans
mitter's concentration, willing the performer each step of the way,
the clues are given. Of course, the performer has some sort of physical
contact with the transmitter. The latter's concentration results in
certain physical reactions, entirely subconscious, which are trans
mitted to the performer. These physical reactions are interpreted by
the performer.
They result in the accomplishment of the task selected for the
demonstrator. The result is achieved solely through the mental
directions of an uninfluenced and unprepared spectator.
Can anything, in view of our present knowledge, more nearly
approach genuine mind reading?
As a matter of fact, experience in the field will reveal that contact
mind reading frequently approaches the genuine mind reading field
even more.
In ELLIOTT'S LAST LEGACY Mr. Newmann has written
a most interesting article called Experimental Telepathy With Cards.
In this paper he advances the theory that muscle reading is not muscle
reading at all, but "contact mind reading." Further, he points out
that a good "mind reader" often will run ahead of the transmitter,
and that extensive experience with the contact method will gradually
equip the performer to execute the tests without contact, and in some
cases, at a remote distance from the transmitter.
While acknowledging that my experience in no way matches
that of Mr. Newmann, I am inclined to agree. I agree simply because
my own experience tends to bear this out. And this is not naivete.
11
CHAPTER TWO
Essentially, the proper start is a discussion of the various types
of contact.
My personal preference, for general use, is for the transmitter,
the person who is to mentally guide the mind-reader, to grasp the
mentalist's left wrist with his right thumb and fingers. The fingers
should be on one side of the wrist and the thumb on another. Dis
courage the transmitter from holding you tightly, as this will make
the reading of the impulses more difficult. Rather have the spec
tator take your wrist naturally, so that he will not be under any
physical tension.
Too much muscular strain on the part of the transmitter will
evidence itself in involuntary physical contractions and relaxations,
difficult to distinguish from the true directing impulses. This may
be confusing- and may tend to send the receiver off on the wrong
track.
Just ask the transmitter to take your wrist naturally, without
any physical discomfort.
Another contact used by many performers is for the transmitter
to place his arm beneath the receiver's, or rather between the latter's
body and elbow. The performer's elbow presses that of the guide.
The sender's forearm lies parallel with the performer's, between the
performer's forearm and body. The hands are clasped together. Of
course, the transmitter uses his right arm and the performer his left.
Some performers take the transmitter's right hand and press it
to their foreheads, holding it with their lefts. This position is held
throughout the test. Others hold the transmitter's fingers lightly in
the palm of their hands.
John Randall Brown's method was to place the back of the
transmitter's hand to his—Brown's —forehead.
In all of these cases, the contacts may be reversed, with the per
former holding or touching the transmitter. In this event, the im
pulses are somewhat different in character, but they are fully as
evident.
Actually, it is not essential that the transmitter and receiver be
in personal contact. A stiff wire, a ruler or a stick may be grasped
in the sender's left hand with the opposite end being held by the
12
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
receiver. After some practice a length of watch-chain, a handker
chief or even a length of cord will be sufficient.
It is even possible to interpret the transmitter's directions by
having him hold his hand about six inches above one of the receiver's
hands. Or he may hold his hand approximately six inches in front
of the receiver's forehead. Another non-contact method is for the
performer to hold his hands extended one above the other. They
are held some fifteen to eighteen inches apart. The transmitter is
asked to extend his hand and hold it between those of the receiver,
maintaining it about the same distance from each hand.
Later in this work I shall relate some curious experiences I have
had with a third person interposed between myself and the trans
mitter. Of course, with the transmitter and receiver, both, grasping
the same arm of an interposed third person, the arm becomes a
common connection between the two.
Now as to this transmitter:
Obviously, he must know clearly what the test is to be.
He must understand that the success or failure of the test depends
upon the intensity of his concentration. It is essential, as Mr. New-
mann says, that he have "a lucid idea of direction."
You will find, with very little experience, that all transmitters
will give you, in general, the same impulses. The intensity of these
impulses, however, will vary considerably with the individual.
Itj
is
curious here to note that the intensity of the impulse does
not necessarily depend upon the physical strength of the transmitter.
I
have had women transmitters of no great physical strength, whose
abilities at concentration were intense, convey to me strong, unmis
takable indications, where many men of great physical strength have
conveyed little or no information.
Having your transmitter,
a
few preliminary movements on your
part will quickly give you indications as to the character of the
impulses you can expect. From this basis you will have to operate.
In the very few cases where you can get absolutely no impulses,
after some attempt,
it
will be necessary for you to ask for
a
new
transmitter. This should be done with extreme tact, explaining that
all people do not convey thought impulses —yet that
it
does not
imply lack of concentration ability —and that in this case
it
will be
necessary to ask for another guide.
You will find these cases are extremely rare.
13
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
Be very careful to give your guide a clear idea as to what he is to
do. Explain to him that, as this is a demonstration in silent thought
communication, it will be necessary for him to concentrate intensely,
and constantly, on what he desires the mind reader to do. He must
have a "lucid idea of direction" at all times, both in locating the
general vicinity of the test, and in the various individual movements
necessary for its accomplishment.
Explain to him that you can only do one thing at a time, and
that is the way you must be directed.
As an example: If he wants you to go forward, he must will it
intensely. Having arrived at the general vicinity, if he wants you
to move to the right or left, he must concentrate on that. Having
made this movement, if he wants you to put your hand out, tell
him to think the movement. Then, if he wants you to lower it, he
must think that also. If he desires you to close your hand about an
object, he must concentrate on that. Having closed your hand, if he
wants the object picked up, he must concentrate both on keeping the
hand closed and moving the hand up.
Now let me explain what this lucid idea of direction means to me:
When you are walking or doing anything, you do not think in
terms of "right" or "left" or "go over to the wall." What you
really think is "that way" or "this way." This is the way this idea
of direction must be conveyed. Be sure to get this clear: The guide
must will you to go "that way," thinking of the direction itself in
terms of its relative position, as he sees it, or "this way." If he wants
the hand to move forward he must think along the direction and
will, "this way."
If he wants you to close your hand he must will the encompass
ing feeling he would have in closing his own hand about the object.
If he desires you to pull back the rug, he must will that your
hand go down "that way." Then, he must will that you feel that
clutch, as he would feel it, if he took the rug. Then he must feel
the retention of that clutch and a definite movement back "this way."
EACH STEP MUST BE WILLED CONSECUTIVELY.
If he wants you to move your leg, and instead you move your
hand, he must feel himself as if he were moving his leg, and give you
a definite "stop" impulse, if you are doing the wrong thing.
Mr. Newmann states there are two essentials in instructing the
transmitter. "First, he must have a lucid idea of direction,— secondly,
14
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
he must exercise unwavering concentration on the details necessary
for a successful experiment." I can't give you any better advice.
But I would add one more essential. Perhaps it is included in the
second point by Mr. Newmann. This is that the transmitter must
"feel" himself doing the required action, like swinging back his foot
to kick, or throwing his arm forward to toss an item, or feeling
himself clutching an object. I think this sense of feeling himself
doing the required thing is quite essential.
Let me be clear: He does not think, "Close your hand." Rather
he feels himself closing his hand. He does not think, "Push the tack
in." He feels himself pushing the tack in. He does not think, "Go
to the right." He feels himself going in the direction desired, or to
the spot sought. He does not think, doing the wrong thing, "Stop."
No, he feels himself stopping.
These things should be clearly and unmistakably explained to
the guide before attempting the test.
Contact mind reading may be done with or without blindfold.
Personally, I think the receiver's perceptions are sharpened unmis
takably by the blindfold —even if not done genuinely. Certainly
the effect from the viewpoint of the spectator is far more impressive.
A handkerchief may be tied over the eyes. Or a large piece of
silk may be used. In this event, because he is able to see down the
sides of his nose, the performer is not genuinely blindfolded. To
the spectators, it will appear that he is unable to see.
Many tricked blindfolds have been explained in textbooks on
magic and mental effects. Burling Hull has published a manuscript
devoted to this subject exclusively.
Personally, I do not favor the hood type of blindfold. There
are several reasons for this, although the principal one is that it'
doesn't seem to me to look natural. A combination blindfold, using
cotton pads held with adhesive tape and the whole covered with a
folded handkerchief, is more convincing and much more effective
in my opinion. This blindfold is similar to that used in The X-ray
Eye Act and in Seeing With the Fingertips.
At Woolworth's, or at most drug stores, you can buy boxes
of small oblong or square cotton pads. These are quite suitable for
eye-pads. These stores also sell several types of adhesive tape. One,
in particular, does not seem to stick very well. It is useful in this
case because its removal is much easier.
15
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
However, a bit of cold cream applied sparingly to the areas where
the tape is to be attached, will expedite removal of the tape. Too
much cold cream will prevent the tape from sticking at all. Experi
ment with this.
A square yard of silk, plain or figured, and a safety pin will do
for the outside covering.
You may use any width tape up to one and one-half inches.
Personally, I prefer the narrower widths because they are fully as
convincing and much less likely to pull in removal.
Cut your tapes off to the proper lengths and lay them out before
you.
Now take one of the pads and place it over one eye. —You have
called upon a spectator to assist in the bandaging. —Ask the spectator
to put a length of adhesive over the pad, diagonally from the center
of the forehead down to the cheek.
As he does this the performer holds the pad, thumb underneath
and fingers outside. The performer squeezes and pinches the pad
together as much as possible at its juncture with the side of the nose.
This clears the line of sight downwards along the side of the nose.
Some performers dip the cotton pads in water before applying them
to the eye, in order that the fuzz on the edge of the pad will be
laid down, thus offering a clearer and wider vision. It is not entirely
necessary.
While the spectator sticks the adhesive to the forehead and over
the pad, the performer closes his eyes tightly and scowls, relaxing
as the tape is applied to the cheek. This lifts the cotton up and away
from the eye.
The same operation is repeated on the other eye.
Many performers have a piece of adhesive tape placed across the
eyelids prior to applying the pads. The natural difficulty of making
the tape stick, plus the application of cold cream to the lower lid,
causes it to let go at the bottom. This is needless, I think, and only
adds difficulty when the tape sticks too tightly to the upper lid, when
removing it.
Other performers put a piece of tape across the pads, across both
eyes, after the diagonal tapes are put on. This again is unnecessary.
But if it is used, all that is necessary to do is to close the eyes slightly
and hold the face naturally. The tape is brought tightly across the
eyes. However, there is slack naturally across the bottom, and the
new tape does not materially interfere with the vision.
16
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
After the. eyes are taped, the silk cloth is folded into a strip three
or three and one-half inches wide. This is brought over the eyes and
pinned in the back.
While the silk is being placed over the eyes, scowl again and ask
that the bandage be made tight. After it has been fastened you will
find it does not interfere with the vision, if you look downwards
along the nose.
As conditions are now, you can see things for a considerable
space, below the eyes. By lifting the eyebrows this area is consider
ably increased. At no time do your eyes convey to the spectators
other than what they seem to be—hopelessly blindfolded.
In working with this blindfold be careful not to tilt the head
back, as it will give the spectators cause for suspicion. It is not
necessary.
Also, if the performer will keep his eyes closed, he will be guarded
against any sudden movement on the part of some spectator who
might suspect that he can see. It will add much because the performer
will do things which he would not do if he could see. The performer
should open his eyes only when absolutely necessary.
Now, although contact mind reading can be done just as well
thoroughly blindfolded as with a trick blindfold, this combination
of the trick blindfold and contact mind reading will make it pos
sible for you to go much further in your demonstration, combining
elements of The X-ray Eye Act, or Seeing With the Fingertips, with
the genuine contact mind reading.
17
CHAPTER THREE
Let us assume that you have had your spectators select the tests,
while you were absent from the room. The transmitter has been
selected. You have returned to the room, and have instructed the
transmitter clearly as to what he is to do.
Now you establish contact with the transmitter in the form you
have found best for you. You are ready to begin.
To make things clear let us assume you have adopted the method
of contact where the transmitter grasps your left wrist with his
right hand.
Now try to make your mind as passive as possible. Do not try
to guess what you are supposed to do. Do not be apprehensive as
to the outcome. You cannot fail. Have confidence in this fact. You
cannot fail because the impulses are unmistakable, if you have had
even a little practice.
Start to move forward, and, at the same time, keep your mind
keenly sensitive to his fingers and thumb at your wrist. That is all
you pay attention to, the pressure of his hand at your wrist.
As you move forward step from side to side, something like an
open field runner does in a football game. Rock gently from foot
to foot, stepping from side to side in a wading motion, testing out
the contact.
You will suddenly discover that the transmitter is unconsciously
guiding you. If you step to the right, and he wants you go to left,
there will be an almost imperceptible pressure on the inside of your
wrist!
If you step to the left when he wants you to go right, there will
be a featherweight pressure on the outside of your wrist!
Here you have the nucleus of contact mind reading.
The secret is almost imperceptible pressure in the direction desired.
If you find the transmitter is leading you, or consciously direct
ing you physically, stop and tell him not to lead you, but to let you
lead him! This will eliminate all suspicion in his mind that he is
to be a confederate of yours. At the same time it will convince the
spectators that you are actually getting his thought impulses.
In starting out don't go slowly. Go as fast as possible, but you
must be sure you are getting the impulses.
18"
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
It is for the purpose of insuring the direction that I suggested
that you step from side to side as you proceed. You will find the
pressure on the wrist, first from one side and then the other, will
definitely indicate the direction you are to travel.
If you sense that he is holding you back, it is quite likely he
wants you to stop. Stop and test him. You will find the restraining
impulse if you start ahead, and you will probably feel a pressure on
one side or the other if you have passed the place. He is probably
willing you to turn.
However, if you feel the restraining pressure, and still do not get
the directional pressure, and meet a restraining impulse if you attempt
to back up, you are at the place he desires you to be.
Stand still! Being assured you will not move, he will then start
directing your hands.
Again you will feel the pressure. To insure your hand moving
in the right direction, move it from side to side. You will find a
pressure on each side of the wrist at certain limits. Move it forward
in a place about center of the restraining points. Of course, you are
moving your right hand, the hand opposite to the contact point.
You may find that the transmitter's pressure on your wrist is get
ting stronger and stronger. Shake your wrist slightly and tell him
to relax.
Then, as your hand moves forward, test him again and again by
moving your hand from side to side. Finally you will find that the
impulses cease. ,
Stop here and explain to the transmitter again that you are very
close to the object, and that from here on he must concentrate even
more strongly on EACH definite direction.
Stand still and wait. Soon you will perceive another definite
pressure—either downwards, forwards, backwards or to one side or
another. Move along that line carefully, testing as you go.
Having reached what seems to be the location of the object, test
each direction again —you will now find pressure in every direction
you move.
Again caution the transmitter to "feel" what he wants you to do.
You will detect a pressure in a definite direction which you must
follow slowly, suddenly you will feel him grasp you as if picking
up something.
19
CONTACT MIND READING — EXPANDED
You will find that your fingers have closed around some object!
This is the item you were expected to pick up.
Pick it up.
Then wait for further impulses. You may feel the impulse, or
pressure, to put it back and as you do so a relaxation of his fingers.
Let go of it. You have probably completed the test. Step back and
wait. If so, there will be no more pressure. If not, you will get an
other definite direction. Sometimes an audible response from the
audience will reveal that the test is concluded.
If the test is to continue, proceed as before. If not, ask the trans
mitter if that is all, and be guided by his answer.
It is always well to instruct the transmitter to tell you when you
have completed the test. This eliminates a delay which would kill
the climax.
I have gone into some detail to explain the interpretation of the
impulses. Eut eventually you may find that you will get a directional
clue and run right along, receiving little or no direction from the
transmitter.
When you are uncertain, stop and test. You will ALWAYS find
the indicating pressure to be there.
Sometimes you may have curious experiences in this connection.
At one performance I was given a transmitter who proved, to have
some nervous difficulty which caused his hand to shake from side to
side. I thought I should find it necessary to call for a new transmitter.
But as I started "testing" him I discovered that the more or less
regularity of his nervous difficulty did not prevent me from detecting
the "guiding impulse." We went through the test successfully with
out additional trouble except that it was necessary for me to be more
careful to differentiate between his difficulty and the directing
pressures.
When I completed the test, which was a preliminary one, I was
relieved that I had caught him for a simple test, instead of one of the
more involved ones. I have said before that I work with my eyes
closed, even when using a precautionary trick blindfold. Imagine my
consternation later, when I was starting on the difficult test, to dis
cover that I had the same transmitter! I didn't want to ask for a new
one, as I was curious1 myself as to how far I could go with a trans
mitter of this type. The test was concluded successfully, and, I think,
with little more time consumed than if the transmitter had been
normal.
20
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
I tell you this simply to emphasize the fact that there is more
reason for you to succeed than to fail.
As to the method of contact where the guide's arm is between the
receiver's arm and side, both clasping hands:
Again you will find that the impulse expresses itself in the form
of pressure. This is more evident than in the first method. You will
find the impulse given you not only from side to side and up and
down, but there will be pressure from his arm towards you, if to the
right, and against your elbow, if to the left.
With the method of contact used by Brown, where the back of
the transmitter's hand is pressed against the receiver's forehead: Em
ploy the testing motion, swaying about. Proceed in the direction
meeting the least resistance, as Burlingame says, "Go in the direction
you find it easiest for the subject and yourself to move."
If you go the wrong way, you will find more resistance.
"All the mind reader has to do," continues Burlingame, "is
simply to observe carefully the action of the muscles of the subject's
hand against his forehead, and to follow in the direction indicated by
the subject's muscles, and he will find himself led unmistakably
toward the place upon which the subject's mind is concentrated. Hav
ing reached the place, the mind reader will feel around with one hand
until the secreted, article is found, and as soon as his hand touches it—
although he has no previous knowledge of its nature —he will rec
ognize it instinctively for the subject has unconsciously imparted
such information by the relaxation of his muscles."
In the case of the contact where you are pressing the tips of his
fingers to your forehead, you will feel a definite movement towards
the direction as you work. There will also be a definite tendency to
squeeze the skin of the forehead when you are willed to grasp some
thing. The pressure becomes stronger when the transmitter wants
you to stop, and lighter when he is leading you.
The ruler or wire contact method gives you guiding clues in the
same way, except you will find the connecting object to be held more
rigidly when the transmitter desires you to pick up something.
A somewhat different procedure is necessary in the case of the
contact with the slack chain or ribbon or handkerchief. It will be
necessary for you to utilize the vision afforded you by the trick blind
fold. In this case, KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE SLACK.
When it is desired that you go to the left, your guide being on
21
CONTACT MIND READING — EXPANDED
your left, you will find the slack to lessen. Sometimes, when the
concentration is strong, the guide will pull the link taut.
In the case of a right turn, the slack is greater. Sometimes the
guide's hand will touch yours.
Watch the direction of his toes as he walks, or when he starts
out. It will give you a definite clue.
Proceed as in the first method —except that the impressions will
be given you in a different way. In the event he desires you to move
forward, there will be a tendency for his hand to move ahead of
yours. In going backward, the reverse will be found to be true. To
grasp an object, you will find the transmitter will contract his hand.
To have you release an object, he will relax his fingers.
Naturally, where you have a flexible contact, it will be necessary
for you to see. Therefore, you will have to dispense with a blindfold,
if you use a genuine one, or use one of the tricked type.
If you are using the non-contact methods, where the transmitter's
hand is held between yours or in front of your forehead, the impulses
are read much the same as in the flexible contact method. Your clues
come from the variations in the spacing between your hands and his,
or between his hand and your forehead.
If it is desired that you go forward, you will find you will have
difficulty in maintaining your distance, whether the transmitter's
hand is held in front of your forehead, or parallel to your extended
arm.. The proper impulse here is to follow the direction where it
is difficult to maintain your space. This movement is totally uncon
scious on the part of the guide.
Having arrived at the place it will be comparatively easy to locate
the object. In this case common horse sense will help you in inter
preting what is desired of you.
There is still another type of test which must be mentioned here
because, there is a slight difference in operation. These are the tests
where the mind reader duplicates a number whispered to the trans
mitter, or a geometrical figure suggested to the latter secretly.
As in all other cases, ultimate success rests with following the
line of least resistance. For these tests the transmitter may hold the
receiver's writing hand, or his contact may be by any of the other
methods.
Here the receiver, by making preliminary motions in the air,
as if trying to make up his mind, gives the transmitter an idea of
22
CONTACT MIND READING — EXPANDED
what he intends to do. This is done very slowly. If he is wrong,
the transmitter will give him. a sign. Finally, through these pressure
clues, the receiver transcribes the proper number or figure.
As a matter of fact, where the transmitter's hand is on the re
ceiver's writing hand, the transmitter will actually trace out the
number or figure for the receiver.
In the number test, there are three general starting locations at
the top of the writing space. Numbers two, three, five, seven —and
perhaps four —start at the left of center. Numbers six and eight —
and sometimes four —start at the center. Nine starts at the right,
although sometimes people may be found who start number eight
at the right.
The receiver first finds the starting location. Then he makes
preliminary testing starts of the numbers which start in that location.
The transmitter's indications will reveal the correct direction. This
is particularly true if the receiver proceeds slowly.
Much the same procedure is utilized in the geometrical figure
test. The performer begins the preliminary motions of a circle,
triangle, square, oblong and so on, once the starting place is clear.
There are a great many things you will observe in .practice and
experience which you recognize and act upon unconsciously.
Many times I go through these tests with only a few conscious
applications of conscious impulses, so great is my concentration on
the actual point of contact. Soon you don't seem to observe these
impulses consciously. You seem simply to move around without
resistance, stopping when you do encounter it. Sometimes these
tests almost work themselves.
This may account for the receiver seeming to run ahead of the
transmitter. I can't pass on this. Many people think the impulse
is actually transmitted to the receiver. Mr. Newmann seems to think
so. I cannot indicate an opinion because I am not at all certain
either way.
All I can say in this regard is that many curious and unexplain-
able things happen. If you are interested in this sort of investigation,
you will have to experiment yourself and reach your own conclusions.
In the line of theories in actual thought transference the article
by Mr. Newmann, referred to before, from ELLIOTT'S LAST
LEGACY, will give you interesting lines of thought.
23
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
I have done only a little experimenting in the field of remote
thought transference and the results to me were not conclusive. Cer
tainly Mr. Newmann's ideas open up some interesting vistas.
24
CHAPTER FOUR
Much difficulty and a great amount of useless and unnecessary
work may. be caused by lack of proper attention to routine. If you
have a general idea as to what you are to do in advance, instead of
rushing blindly into a test, the nature of which you are unaware,
many of the early hazards can be avoided.
There are several simple tests which are extremely effective. As
a matter of fact, for public demonstration there is no necessity for
entering into tests of which you have no general knowledge ahead of
time.
THE LETTER DELIVERY
The note or letter delivery test is an excellent example. Have
someone write the name of a person who is present, upon a sheet of
paper. This sheet may be folded or sealed in an envelope. The
identity of the written name is unknown to anyone except the
writer. The person who wrote the name then acts as your trans
mitter. He mentally guides you to the person whose name has been
written in the message. You deliver it.
This test is made possible through reading the impulses as detailed
previously. The difference between this and a complex test is that
you know exactly what you are to do. All you need from the trans
mitter is direction to the person he selected.
The problem is quite simple. The letter is put in your hands.
You are to deliver it to the person to whom you are directed.
Two or three people may write similar notes. Changing trans
mitters with each note, the performer does this multiple test as one
demonstration.
THE HIDDEN KNIFE
Have an ordinary pocket knife borrowed and hidden. Caution
the person hiding the knife to hide it in some place that can be
reached easily —a place that will not involve climbing or other risk
on the part of the mind reader, due to his being blindfolded.
Again you know what you are to do. Simply find a pocket
knife, to which the transmitter, in this case the person hiding the
knife, will direct you.
THE HIDDEN RING
Borrow a ring from someone present and have it hidden. The
test is to find the ring, return it to the rightful owner and slip it on
25
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
the proper finger.
This test is very effective. Again, it is not difficult, because all
you have to find is the ring, the lady and the finger. The rest, the
difficult part, you know.
SORTING OUT THE HATS
Five or six hats are borrowed and piled in some place in the
room, or hall. The transmitter is to memorize each hat and its
owner. The test for the mind reader is to find each owner and
place the proper hat on the proper head.
This presents no more difficulties than the previous test. The
entire affair depends upon the transmitter properly identifying the
proper owner of each respective hat.
THE HIDDEN OBJECT
This is merely the hiding of some object, unknown to the per
former, and finding it. The only new difficulty here is to identify the
hidden object. You will have no difficulty in finding the object and
in identifying it if you concentrate on the impulse interpretations
as discussed above.
PIANO TEST
Using contact mind reading methods, the receiver may pick out
the air of a simple melody.
NUMBER TEST
Tracing out a number or a geometrical figure, secretly suggested
to the transmitter, has been discussed in detail.
'
REUNITING SEPARATED COUPLES
Two people, selected as a couple, are separated. The mind reader
finds them out and reunites them.
THE MURDER MYSTERY
The murder mystery is always a favorite. This may be varied
somewhat by changing the crime to a kidnapping, a jewel robbery
or some other such happening. The detective story aspect maintains
interest.
While the mind reader is out of the room, the spectators decide
upon a victim, a murderer, a place where the crime was committed
and a weapon. The performer explains that the body is usually
hidden, in a real murder mystery, but that in this case it would be
26
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
more difficult to find the victim in the midst of live people. There
fore, the victim remains with the others.
The criminal also remains with the others, for the same reason.
The same restrictions as those outlined for the hidden knife test
should apply to the place selected for the crime, the place selected for
hiding the weapon and to the selection of the weapon itself.
Some performers go so far as to have an arresting officer, a judge
and a jury selected. But this drags the demonstration out too long
in my opinion.
The test may be elaborated by actually having the selected char
acters enact the crime. In this case the mind reader may include, as
part of his test, ultimately assuming the positions of the victim and
the murderer with the weapon at the time the crime was committed.
In the kidnapping case the principal characters, the place where
the crime took place, the place of hiding the victim and the form of
the ransom constitute the tests for the mind reader.
In the case of the robbery, the mind reader finds the victim, the
robber, the place where the jewel was kept, the place where it was
hidden by the robber, and the jewel itself.
RETURNING BORROWED PROPS
An effective bit, after doing a solution of this character, is to
ask the transmitter if he knows to whom the various objects belong,
and upon his affirmative answer to deliver them back to the owners.
FINDING THE MENTALLY SELECTED CARD
A card is selected —mentally, or taken from the pack openly. It
is returned and the pack is shuffled. Of course, the transmitter is
the person who selected the card. Sometimes it is advisable to have
the name of the card written down.
For this demonstration, the cards are laid on the table face up,
in a row or in a circle, so that all cards show.
The cards are found as before.
This card act may be elaborated to include taking a predeter
mined poker hand from the pack, separating the blacks from the reds,
and so on.
In the latter two tests, if the poker hand itself is mentioned
aloud, the trick nature of the blindfold will enable you to make
the selection or separation without any other difficulty than merely
looking at the pack as you go through it.
27
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
THE BOOK TEST
You may have a definite word, in a definite line, on a definite
page of a book selected. The transmitter will direct you to it.
The transmitter directs you as before, willing you which way
to turn the pages. Having arrived at two opened pages, he guides
you to the proper one. You run your hand up and down the page
to the proper line, and back and forth over the line to the proper
word.
You add a definite punch when you undertake to spell out the
definite word.
This may, of course, be done by taking advantage of the blind
fold, and then after several false starts, seem to hit upon the first
letter, then the next and the next until it is spelled out.
THE BLACKBOARD TEST
The writing of the selected word, or the writing of a mentally
selected card, or the drawing of a picture of the selected card may
be done genuinely, also.
Simply use the contact best suited to you, take the chalk in your
right hand and ask the transmitter to will the direction of your hand
movements. For this purpose it is better to print the letters, than
to write them.
Move the chalk very slowly, following the definite impulses of
the guide. Usually, when you are part way through, you can guess
the remainder of the word. In this event, finish as rapidly as possible.
LOCATING THE PARTS OF A DISMEMBERED CARD .
This is simply a variation of the hidden object test.
CARD PLAYING DEMONSTRATION
Mr. Newmann has suggested, in his article in the Elliott book, a
two-handed game of Pitch or Seven Up. Another demonstration
is for the performer, with the transmitter at his left, to play a game
of Poker or Bridge.
With the advantage given by the trick blindfold, you can fake
this. Apparently you get your direction from the transmitter,
although you can actually play this game, with the exception of the
betting and bidding, by the contact mind reading method alone.
You can even do the bidding and betting, if you want to take all
that time and trouble.
28
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
Of course, in the play you run your hand along the top of the
fan and pick out the card desired by the transmitter.
This can even go so far as picking up the tricks.
. I might say that an adept at running up the cards, or switching
to a cold deck, could bring this card demonstration to a knockout
conclusion by running up the pack while blindfolded. Then he
may play the hands. Almost any of the standard set-ups for poker
deals could be used, if the performer had a duplicate of his set-up
deck, and a natural method of switching.
NAMING THE CHOSEN OR MENTALLY SELECTED CARD
Your regular contact, or touching the finger tips of the trans
mitter to those of the mind reader, with the arms extended may
be used.
This is done by a process of elimination by saying "red" or
"black," over and over again until you are sure of the definite pulsa
tion. Then having the color, say "hearts or diamonds," or the other
suits, if the selection is black, until you can distinguish a definite
pulsation. Then narrow it down to face cards or spot cards, above
or below the five, and so on until you have eliminated all but the
right one.
, In tests of this nature, however, your pulsations or impulses are
much more difficult to distinguish, owing to the fact that the "direc
tional" impulse is impossible. This usually takes considerable prac
tice and experience. Such tests are not recommended at the beginning.
THE PIN OR TACK TEST
Probably one of the most effective tests in the entire category of
mental thought transmission is the one wherein a pin is driven into
the wall, then taken out and the pin hidden.
The test is for the mind reader to find the pin, then to find the
location of the pinhole and to insert the pin in the pinhole.
This may be executed totally blindfolded, relying on nothing
but the transmitter's directions. In this case, the pinhole should be
made somewhere about shoulder height. During the entire test, both
while finding the pin and while directing the pin to the hole, the
transmitter must be in such a position that he may CLEARLY, and
without difficulty, see the pin while it is being sought, and the hole
while the mind reader is trying to locate it.
29
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
This test is only a little more difficult than the others, in the
respect that you know in general what you are to do. The real
secret of this test, however, is in fitting the pin into the hole. If
you are actually blindfolded, you must "test" the transmitter repeat
edly, and with patience, gradually getting the area in front of you
contracted, until you reach a spot where you meet with resistance
in every direction. Then slowly push the pin home!
This test is a real knockout when staged properly.
With the advantage of the trick blindfold, it is almost impossible
to fail.
An effective variation of this test is the one where a pin or a
tack is hidden somewhere in the room, and a spectator draws a small
circle one-half or one-quarter inch in diameter. The demonstration
is to find the pin or tack, find the circle and to insert the pin or tack
inside the circle.
This test is effective and certain, if the performer is careful, PRO
VIDING THE PERFORMER INSISTS THAT THE CIRCLE
BE DRAWN SOMEWHERE BELOW SHOULDER HEIGHT.
You usually don't have the nice control of your hands above shoul
der height. It may be drawn beneath a rug, or on the bottom of.
something.
Of course, with the trick blindfold the test is made much easier.
I will say, however, that I once had an experience, while wearing
the trick blindfold, that was unusual.
I was doing the pin in the circle test, and, although when led to
the location, I could see clearly, I could not find the circle. Disre
garding the impulses of the transmitter, I picked up objects on the
table, thinking it was underneath something. But I simply could
not see thcj circle.
Finally, I decided to allow the transmitter to find it for me.
Gradually my hands were directed to some magazines in a rack, be
yond the table, and I knew that the magazines were the location of
the ring. Still I could not see the circle.
I moved my hand with the pin back and forth over the edge
of the magazines, yet the transmitter was constantly directing me off
the magazines.
Then I realized the circle was- not on the edge of the magazines,
which were standing up in the rack, but on the sides. As I looked
30
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
I could see that the trick, blindfold would be of little help. The
side indicated was in deep shadow.
So I let the transmitter direct me again, carefully testing, holding
the" pin at right angles to the surface of the book. Finally I reached
what I thought was the spot.
THE PIN WAS ALMOST IN DEAD CENTER OF THE
CIRCLE!
THE BLINDFOLD DRIVE
I do not recommend contact mind reading for the blindfold
drive, although many performers of great experience have success
fully accomplished it. It is far safer to use any of the prearranged
or faked methods for publicity purposes, due to the many dangers
both to the performer and to pedestrians.
You can safely undertake the blindfold walk. That is, if the
police will let you tie up traffic.
The same general rules are applicable.
31
CHAPTER FIVE
Remember again, before starting on your test, try out the trans
mitter. Move from side to side until you can distinguish the impulses
you are to expect, unmistakably.
Be mentally alert to the contact at your wrist. Concentrate on
the contact to the exclusion of all else, your own' ideas, or opinions.
Instruct your transmitter thoroughly and properly. Insist that
he undertake the test IN ALL SERIOUSNESS. Levity or comedy
or laxity in concentration simply will get you nowhere.
You can move with assurance and certainty until you reach the
general vicinity of the test. Then proceed more cautiously, testing
the transmitter by moving your body from side to side, and moving
your hand from side to side.
You will find that, as you get down to the actual fine points of
the test, the impulses may become less and less distinguishable. This
is because the transmitter may not have a CLEAR idea as to how to
direct you. If this happens, stop and reinstruct your guide. Explain
to him; that he must "will" each definite movement in succession.
That he must not even think of the next movement until the suc
ceeding one is accomplished. Then he must "feel" what he wants
you to do.
After a fair trial, if you cannot succeed, call for another trans
mitter. Be careful to explain to the first one that inability to transmit
completely does not necessarily mean that he is not strong minded,
or that he is incapable of deep concentration. Tell him it is simply
a condition that arises, wherein one person is capable of more certain
thought transference than another.
Be certain to make it clear to the transmitter that it is HIS mind,
HIS suggestions, HIS directions that you are interpreting, and that
if he is not concentrating strongly you cannot be successful.
Inefficient transmission is often a lack of clear understanding on
the part of the transmitter, either as to what is ta be done by the
mind reader, or how he is to direct the reader.
When hot sure of directions, keep moving from side to side, but
not advancing. This will cause insistence on the part of the trans
mitter, and the pulsation will become more definite.
You will find that an intelligent, nervous type makes a better
transmitter than the more stolid character.
32
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
The faster you move at first, the quicker you will get the definite
directional clue, and the stronger will be the guide's insistence.
THE GENERAL TEST
Most beginners in contact mind reading, until their experience
shows them that such a great amount of work is unnecessary, take
on tests the nature of which they do not have any idea. Tests of
this type are frequently done for the benefit of the scientifically
minded audience, as well.
Of course, in the latter case, they are advisable. But as a part
of an ordinary entertainment, there is no need to undertake a difficult,
slow or uncertain demonstration.
These tests are only limited by what the ingenuity of the spec
tators can devise. They may consist of a number of senseless, dis
connected tests. Or they may be a demonstration made up of a long,
detailed chain of operations combining the most illogical with the
most ordinary.
For this type of test there is little I can say except to give general
information.
Usually it is best to adopt one of the more close methods of con
tact, like the hand on wrist, or the arm to arm.
In starting out, "test" your transmitter carefully. The start is
much the same as any other test. Having arrived at the first stage of
the demonstration, proceed with caution. Here it might be well to
take advantage of the trick blindfold and look around a bit.
There may be several objects in front of you which the trans
mitter may want picked up. A cigarette case may mean that you are
to remove a cigarette. A book may mean that you are to open the
book to a definite page. A bouquet of flowers would suggest taking
one and putting it in yours or someone's else buttonhole. A hat
suggests putting it on someone's head.
Many articles will suggest an understandable, natural action.
BUT BE CAREFUL. The very naturalness of the anticipated action
may lead you into trouble.
Be sure! Test the transmitter repeatedly, with that side to side
and up and down movement of the hand I have told you about.
Keep mentally alert to the contact.
Start the motion of one of the anticipated actions, BUT TEST
EVERY INCH OF THE WAY. The moment you meet with any
opposition on the part of the guide, retrace your steps cautiously.
33
CONTACT MIND READING EXPANDED
As you retrace, continue testing, soon you will find a line of action
that does not meet with opposition.
Perhaps you have started for the wrong article. Perhaps, having
the right article, you are starting the wrong action. REMEMBER
JUST BECAUSE AN ARTICLE IS ORDINARY, USED FOR
AN ORDINARY PURPOSE, IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY
FOLLOW IT IS DESIRED THAT YOU DO AN ORDINARY
OPERATION WITH IT.
As an example of how unpredictable these tests may be: Recently
I witnessed a test wherein it was desired that the mind reader take
a person by the arm, help him to his feet, turn him around and
then implant a swift kick to his unsuspecting posterior! This was a
stag affair, and the test was not a proper one. Yet it was the test.
Another example : The performer was desired to pick a hat from
the floor and hang, it on the toe of a spectator who was seated with
his legs crossed.
I cannot emphasize too much the value of this repeated "testing"
as you proceed, particularly in the beginning of your experience. If
you test as you go, you can clearly detect an opposing influence and
change your course to one wherein you are being directed.
Start the natural thing to do and rely upon your repeated testing
to be sure that you are proceeding correctly. If you cannot imagine
what is desired, relax and intensify your concentration on the point
of contact. Do not try to impose your own conclusions upon the
guide. Carefully move along the line of his direction.
If this seems to be unproductive of result, stop and reinstruct
your guide. Be particular to emphasize that he must "feel himself"
doing the deed he is willing you to do. Emphasize that he must
definitely "feel" progressively, and in succession, the various moves
necessary to accomplish the purpose. Watch his hands and feet and
legs.
If moving the hands seems wrong, start moving the feet. Be
alert to the contact.
Eventually, through experimenting and testing you will reach
your objective. But emphasize clearly to your guide that HE MUST
HAVE A CLEAR IDEA AS TO WHAT YOU ARE TO DO
AND THE VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL MOVEMENTS NECES
SARY TO DO IT.
34 .
CONTACT MIND READING —EXPANDED
It should be evident now why it is such a great advantage for
the performer tq have, before starting, a general idea as to what the
test is to be. The difficulty of attempting an unplanned test is abso
lutely unnecessary in public performance. In fact, it is to be dis
couraged because of the great amount of time often taken up, much
to the discomfort of the spectators.
For public performance, I would recommend a carefully routined
program. Perhaps this could be made up of, some of the tests out
lined here. Or you might devise some original tests.
35
CHAPTER SIX
Not because I want you to follow this pattern, but because a
suggested routine always serves as a definite map for planning an
original program, I shall give you the fundamentals of a routine
which should run not more than thirty minutes.
The opening speech might run something like this:
New discoveries in the sciences are being made almost constantly.
Tonight I shall attempt a demonstration of something which may
afford you considerable food for thought on the possibilities of
mental communication.
Ideas which were ridiculed a few years ago are the facts of today.
Not long ago the newspapers announced that scientists had succeeded
in photographing the atom.
As you know, the atom is the basic constituent of all forms of
things which we classify as matter. They make up the earth, the
things of the earth, the water and the air.
An interesting feature of this discovery is that, after considerable
difficulty in photographing the atom, it was found that its basic
ingredients were merely negative and positive charges of electricity.
The atom is merely force!
Thus, the solid slab of granite is demonstrated to be actually no
more material or solid than a breath of the thinest air.
Things are developing to a point where science is demonstrating
that all of our material ideas are basically nothing but concepts of
thought.
In this connection, then, I should tike to point out the great
advancement made in thought communication when the telegraph
superseded the letter, when the telephone took the place of the tele
graph, and when the radio supplanted the telephone.
Tonight I shall undertake to demonstrate to you yet another
advancement in thought communication. This demonstration shall
be in the form of the communication of an unwritten and an uttered
thought from one individual to another.
Whether there is basis for a belief that there is a sixth, unde
veloped, sense in man, I shall leave to your decision at the conclusion
of the tests.
The performer now asks for the services of one or two spec
tators to supervise the bandaging of his eyes. They are brought to
CONTACT MIND READING — EXPANDED
the stage or platform for this purpose.
Then the audience is asked to select two or three people for
the sealed letter delivery test. These people are brought up and care
fully instructed in their parts, after which the tests are executed
with as much speed as possible.
If the performer cares to do so, he may casually add some demon
strations of The X-ray Eye Act or Seeing With the Fingertips. Only
three or four such demonstrations are done. They are done quite
without undue emphasis, as the performer is in the audience at the
conclusion of the letter delivery test. On his way back to the plat
form, the performer describes several people or articles quite matter-
of-factly. To be consistent, of course, this should be done with the
performer in contact with someone. He apparently gets these impres
sions through transmitted thought, not directly.
Returning to the platform once more, the performer does the
murder mystery.
This is sufficient for a short program. But, if time allows, a
final, smashing feature could be made of the pin in hole or pin in
circle tests.
Some performers open their programs, where they are giving a
full evening performance, with super memory demonstrations based
upon the principles of THE ROTH MEMORY COURSE or other
similar system of mnemonics.
Combining contact mind reading with the usual run of mental
effects based on trickery makes a strong salable entertainment. Thus,
billet readings, prediction effects, living and dead tests, mental con
trol effects and others of like nature may be used.
The writings of Ted Annemann, particularly his complete files
of THE JINX or a recent publication culled from the magazine,
ANNEMANN'S PRACTICAL MENTAL EFFECTS, supply a
wealth of suitable material. There are many other books detailing
tricks of this nature.
As I have said before here, I have heard it said by some magi
cians that they thought "muscle reading" to be fakery. Let me
emphasize again that this is not true. The principles set forth in
this work are true and workable. Anyone may try contact mind
reading. Having tried it, there will be no further need to fake these
tests, as you will quickly see.
It is not difficult. In fact, it is quite easy if you are of the proper
temperament. A person with acute mental perception may experiment
37
CONTACT MIND READING — EXPANDED
with several individuals for an hour or so, after which he can present
a demonstration. Perhaps there are people who lack sufficient mental
alertness to operate contact mind reading. But without question
one who is mentally quick will find no difficulty whatever.
Practice it. Then go out and try it. You will find it to supply
a dignified, impressive routine so engrossing, properly presented, that
audiences will be eager for it.
INTERPOSING A THIRD PERSON
Before closing this work I want to point out an interesting line
of speculation with contact mind reading, even though it may cause
some of the more skeptical of my confreres to shout, "Fake."
At various times I have experimented with the placing of a third
person between myself and the transmitter, each of us holding a
different hand. The third person was as ignorant as I of the test
to be done. We used the same method of contact, for all.
Now please don't insist that I explain why it is possible, and
do not insist that it can't be done if I can't explain it, BUT IN
THE MAJORITY OF THESE TESTS THE DIRECTIONAL
IMPULSES AND THE NECESSARY CLUES HAVE BEEN
RENDERED TO ME BY THE THIRD PERSON, EVEN
THOUGH IGNORANT HIMSELF AS TO THE TEST TO
BE PERFORMED.
This has actually happened; Not once, but many times. At
this moment, although I have1 never attempted it in public, I should
have no more hesitation in attempting some of the more simple tests
with a third person between myself and the transmitter, than I would
attempt any form of contact mind reading.
I repeat, I don't know why, I can't explain why; and I should
be very much interested in any information which may clarify this
for me. But it happens! Try it with confidence, in the same frame
of mind as the direct contact method. I think you will find it will
work.
But the further you get into this contact mind reading matter
the more you will become convinced that there are many curious
things that happen in the realm of the mind.
