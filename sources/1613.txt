PREFATORY ADDRESS
TO THE
ENGLISH NATION.
I had intended to visit England in 1817, and
had secured apartments in London for that pur-
pose, when I was informed that the government
did not permit persons who were skilled in.the
Ccelestial Science, to practise openly in then
profession. 1 was advised that I might he con-
sulted privately, and give subscription lectures
to the nobility and gentry, many of whom were
anxious for my arrival. But, having for many
vears enjoyed uncontrolled freedom of practice
in the French capital, I disdained to do any
thine covertly against the English laws ; and 1
had no wish to render myself at all liable to the
surveillance of the police. Thus the scheme
was abandoned, and, as far as the English peo-
ple were concerned, I was obliged to confine
myself to those who visited me at Pans.
Having now fallen into the vale of years, and
being much afflicted by disease, I have, for some
time, relinquished my practice ;
and as there is
no one among my relatives whom I consider at
IV PREFATORY ADDRESS.
all adapted to succeed me, I have resolved to
publish the Oracle, on which the whole of my
experience and fame, as a Fortune-teller, have
been founded.
Whilst I do this in my own language and
country, I also publish a translation of it, in
London. I publish it with more pleasure, as I
have been encouraged thereto by a great num-
ber of English, Irish, and Scottish nobility and
gentry who reside in France. From them, in
general, I have experienced much politeness
and urbanity; and have, on many occasions,
received valuable tokens of their regard. I
have, therefore, had the translation made by
very careful hands, and now transmit it to the
London booksellers, by my nephew M. Pierre
Le Bon, who shall superintend its publication.
I feel it due to the French and English pub-
lic, to relate, in this place, the history of the
original manuscript, of which the following is a
copy, and which I have had in my possession
ever since my thirteenth year.
My aunt, Madame Bichat, who had for many
years been eminent in the profession, being on
her death-bed, sent my mother for the Cur& of
St Sulpiee, in order to receive her confessions,
and to prepare her for another world. As soon
as my mother was gone, Madame Bichat, put-
ting her hand under her pillow, drew forth a vo-
lume bound in parchment, and fastened with
golden clasps.
“ My dear child,” said she, addressing herself
PREFATORY ADDRESS. V
to me, who sat by her bed-side, “ to you 1 be-
queath this precious volume;—peruse it fre-
quently and attentively ; —keep it carefully, as
long as you live, and may Heaven give you the
right understanding to comprehend its won-
derful secrets,—by which the destinies of all
men, from the prince to the peasant, from the
lord to his meanest hind, are unalterably swayed.
—Keep it carefully hidden from all mortal eyes
but your own ! I sent your mother for the Cur£,
in order to have an opportunity—to me the
only one now remaining—of appointing you my
successor in that art, by which, as you already
know, I have earned a handsome fortune, and
no inconsiderable portion of celebrity.”
In amazement at this extraordinary address,
I took the proffered Book, and, opening it, was
agitated by an instinctive terror, on inspecting
its contents. “ Be not alarmed, my dear child,”
resumed the dying penitent, “ but listen atten-
tively to the short account which I shall give
you of its history !
—Those names which you
see at the beginning, were inscribed there bv
the several Sorceresses,—do not be alarmed at
the word,—who have successively been its pro-
prietors. My own name is the last, and that
must be succeeded by yours, when you bequeath
the mystical volume, as I now do, to the person
whom you shall think most worthy of possess-
ing it after your death.
“ It would be tedious, and would only serve
to burthen your memory, to describe to you the
Vi PREFATORY ADDRESS.
characters of all the persons who possessed this
Oracle : —it is sufficient merely to state, that
the volume came into my hands by lineal de-
scent from the celebrated Madame Voisin, of
whom, and of whose wicked practices, you have,
no doubt, heard. She, not content with the
power and fortune which this Book gave her,
permitted herself to be seduced by the arch-
enemy of mankind ; and, instigated by the evil
spirit which he had infused into her, she gave
her assistance to those married women who
were desirous of getting rid of their husbands
in a secret manner, by poison. These infamous
purposes she accomplished by means of a deadly
draught, named the aqua tofana, which she had
great skill in preparing, and which she sold at
a high price. This poison was prepared of a
strength proportionate to the danger of dis-
covery, and effected the intended purpose either
immediately, or at the end of six, eight, or
twelve months, after administration, according
as suspicion was or was not, expected to arise
in the mind of the intended victim. But her
diabolical actions were at length brought to
light, and she soon suffered the penalty of her
crimes. She confessed at the place of execu-
tion, that she had learned the art of preparing
her venomous potions from a Sicilian sorceress,
named Eurythea.”
“ But,” said I, interrupting my dying relative,
“ if this Book teaches such practices as you
mention, I shall be terrified to keep it in my
PREFATORY ADDRESS. Vll
possession for a single day ; far less should I
be able to follow such a dreadful profession.”
“ Dearest child,” replied my aunt, with a faint
smile, “ it is not necessary that, to carry on the
profession of Fortune-telling you should sell
yourself to the Devil, as Voisin did: on the
contrary, we see in her fate, a most deserved
punishment for her enormous crimes. Be sa-
tisfied then ;
—all that you have to do is to read
attentively, and practise strictly, the instruc-
tions contained in this Book ; and to lead a be-
coming life, so as to merit the appellation of a
good Christian. One thing I would guard you
against, however : —never reveal to your con-
fessor that you have such a volume in your pos-
session. You may tell him every thing but
that, which is no sin, and with which he can
of course have no concern. Such a confession
might prove prejudicial to you, and would cer-
tainly tend to the destruction of that, in which
the fortunes of men have been revealed, in
France, from the days of Voisin;—in Italy,
from the time of the sorceress Lavinia, who
flourished under the emperor Justinian ;
—in the
city of Rome, where the augurs consulted it,
from, the days of Vespasian ; —and in Jerusalem,
where it had been used by the seers, or wise
men, from the Babylonish captivity until the
destruction of the Holy City by Titus,—who
found it in the innermost part of the Temple,
and carried it in triumph to his father. The
tradition states, that the Book was carried from
Y'lll PREFATORY ADDRESS.
Babylon to Jerusalem in the year 536 before
the Christian era, when Cyrus, the Persian king,
delivered the Jews from their cruel thraldom,
and rebuilt their Holy City and Temple : —but
respecting its further antiquity", nothing mate-
rial is certainly known, except that it was the
Book, from which the Magi of the East drew
their divinations.”
As Madame Bichat uttered these words, my
mother and the Cur& entered the chamber. The
latter going up to the bed-side, made a sign for us
to leave the room ; and as we were preparing to
obey, my aunt, beckoning to me, said, “ I must
now cease to think of earthly objects ;
therefore,
it is my wish that we should not meet again.
—My last words to you are. Remember my in-
structions, and be careful of my gift /” 1 pro-
mised to do as she desired, and we departed.
In the course of the same day, having received
the holy sacrament, she expired.
On due reflection, I have now determined,
for the benefit of the world at large, to publish
the Book in question ;
more particularly that,
(as I have stated at the beginning of this Ad-
dress,) I know of no individual who is worthy
of being the sole depositary of so valuable a
legacy.
I shall conclude, by stating my disbelief of
a report which has lately reached me, viz.—that
there i£ a fac-simile copy of this manuscript in
the Palace of the Escurial, and in possession of
the present king of Spain. It is said to have been

who found it in the library of the Holy Tribunal
at Seville, to which place it hnci been removed
on the destruction of the famous inquisition at
Thoulouse. The report further states, that the
volume was originally found on the person of an
heretic who was undergoing the torture, during
the persecution of the Albigieois.
*3 hat a book ot a singular character may have
been thus found and preserved, I will not deny ;
but, that it must be totally different from the
one now offered to the Public, is evident from
the fact, that Ferdinand’s conduct has been at
constant variance with common sense; and that
his bigotry and fatuity would not have led him
into so many perils, had he ever looked into, or
consulted, the following Work.

In order to consult the Oracle, with advantage, the
Enquirer must state the nature of his Question to any
Lady in the company, who shall act as Priestess for the
time being. The Priestess having inspected the Table
of Coelestial Signs, shall now point out to the Enquirer,
which of the whole Twelve, exercises an influence, or
presides over, the subject under consideration. The En-
quirer shall then write out, on a slip of paper, the Ques-
tion which is placed opposite to it : —that being the form
in which it must be put to the Oracle.
These preliminaries being duly arranged, the Priestess
must shuffle a pack of common Playing Cards,* and hav-
* Cards were originally invented in Egypt ; though the current
opinion of the present day is, that they were invented about a
century or two back, and first used for the amusement of a young
French prince. That Cards, however, are of the high origin
above asserted, is easily proved by their numbers, suites, and

characters, corresponding strictly with the astronomical signs and
calculations of the ancient Egyptians, who are acknowledged to
have been better acquainted with the motions of the heavenly
bodies, than any other nation that ever existed. But to the
proof :
—
The Colours are two, Red and Black, answering to the two
Equinoxes.
The Suites are four, answering to the four Seasons. The em-
blems of these formerly were, and still are, in Spain,—for the
Heart, a Cup, which is emblematic of Winter
;
for the Spade,
an Acorn, the emblem of Autumn
;
for the Club, a Trefoil,
the emblem of Summer
;
and for the Diamond, a Rose, which
is the emblem of Spring.
The 12 Court Cards answer to the 12 Months, and these were
formerly painted with the Signs of the Zodiac.
The 52 Cards, or whole Pack, answer to the number of Weeks
in the Year.

opposite to it, and which will be found to be the true

For the sake of example, I shall suppose that the
Enquirer had cut the Eight of Diamonds, which is

the Question asked, was, ((

THE FORTUNATE DAY.
In order to secure as favourable a result as the Fates
will allow, it is certainly the most judicious plan to fix
upon Fridays as the days most suitable for Consultation.
This day has been held mystical, and, as it were, set
apart from the other days of the week, both in ancient
and modern times ; and, assuredly, from my own ex-
perience, I can truly state, that the Oracle has, in nine
cases out of ten, been propitious to those persons, of all
nations, who have done me the honour to consult me on
a Friday, It was for this reason, that during all the
other days of the week, I steadily refused an interview
with the Russian Autocrat, and the other illustrious
DIRECTIONS, &c. xv
Grangers, who were in France in 1815 ; as I feared that
an unfavourable Answer might prejudice me in their
opinion,—seeing they might apprehend that I was pre-
determined to portend ill-luck and misfortune to men,
who, though victorious, were still looked on with hatred
by many of my countrymen.
So well vras my excellent and lamented patron, the
Emperor Napoleon, aware of the fortunate day, that,
twice only, during the whole course of our acquaintance,
did he consult me on any other day ; and the Answers
which he then received, with thqir almost immediate ful-
filment, were such as justified him in abstaining, ever
after, from consulting me except on a Friday. I am
tempted to relate, here, a curious circumstance, which
happened in 1809 : —Being in the neighbourhood of St.
Cloud, on a Tuesday, I sent a servant with my humble
duty to the Emperor, requesting an interview respecting
a favour which 1 wished to be granted to one of my
nephews. Napoleon returned me a note, saying “ that
he greatly desired an interview, but as there were matters
of great moment which he had to consult me upon, he
feared that he should be tempted to put the Question at
once; and that he was therefore afraid to trust himself
with me till Friday, when he should pay me a visit, and
grant my petition.” The Emperor came accordingly, and
I feel gratification when I look back, that the Oracle,
in this instance, was consulted with peculiar advantages
both to the Sovereign and the Empire at large.—I al-
lude to the victory of Waffram and the peace of Vienna.
XVI DIRECTIONS, &c.
I have adduced this instance, as the strongest in my re-
collection, of the propriety of adhering to a rule which
I consider to be indispensible for propitiating the cceles-
tial bodies which rule over our destinies.
I shall conclude this address by a brief
DISSERTATION ON ORACLES.
Ftw institutions have been so famous, or have taken
so strong a hold on the minds of mankind for a number
of ages, as Ohacles. In all truces or treaties of peace,
the Greeks and Asiatics never forgot to stipulate for the
liberty of consulting their own Oracles, or those in other
countries which were most famous for declaring the de-
crees of Fate. —No colony undertook new settlements, no
war was declared, no important affair begun, without first
consulting the Oracles.
The most renowned were those of Delphos, Dodona,
Trophonius, Jupiter Ammon, and the Clarian Apollo.
The manner of delivering the Oracles of Dodona was
very singular. There were several copper kettles sus-
pended from trees near a brazen statue, which was also
suspended with a bunch of rods in its hand. When
the wind happened to put it in motion, it struck the first
kettle, which communicating its motion to the rest, all of
them tinkled, and produced a certain sound ; after which
the Oracle spoke.
The Oracle of Jupiteu Ammon was in the desert, in
the midst of the burning sands of Africa. This Oracle
DIRECTIONS, See. XVH
declared to Alexander that Jupiter was Ins father. At'tei
several questions, having asked if the death of his father
was sufficiently revenged, the Oracle answered, “ Thar
the death of Philip was revenged, but the father of
Alexander was immortal.”
Diodorus Siculus, Plutarch, and several other authors
relate, that a herd of goats discovered the Oracle of
Delfhos, or of the Pythian Apollo, When a goat hap-
pened to come near enough to the cavern, so as to breathe
the air that passed out of it, she returned skipping and
bounding about, and her voice articulated some extraor-
dinary sounds. This having been observed by the goat-
herds, they went to look in, and were seized with a fury
that made them jump about, and foretel future events.
Pausanias describes the ceremonies that were prac-
tised for consulting the Oracle of Trophonius. Any
man that went down into his cave, never laughed his
whole life after. This gave occasion to the proverbial
saying concerning those of a melancholy air :
“ He has
consulted Trophonius.”
Tacitus speaks thus of the Oracle of the Clarian
Apollo: “ Germanicus went to consult the Oracle ol
Claros. It is not a woman that delivers the Oracle there,
as at Delphos; but a man chosen out of certain families,
and always of Miletum. It is sufficient to tell him the
number and names of those who come to consult him ;
whereupon he retires into a grot, and, having taken some
water out of a well that lies hid in it, he answers you in
verse to whatever you have thought of.”
XV111 DIRECTIONS, &c.
Dion Cassius explains the manner in which the Oracle
of Nymphea, in Epirus, delivered its responses. The
party that consulted took incense, and, having prayed,
threw it into the fire. If the thing desired was to he
obtained, the incense was immediately in flames ; and,
even in the case of its not falling into the fire, the
flame pursued and consumed it. But, if the thing was
not to succeed, the incense did not come near the fire
;
or, if it fell into the flame, it started out and fled.
Those who consulted the Oracle of AMPHiARnrs,
lay on the skins of victims, and received the answers of
the Oracle in a dream. Virgil attests the same thing of
the Oracle of Faunus, in Italy.
In the temple of the Goddess of Syria, when the statue
of Apollo was inclined to deliver Oracles, it sweated,
moved, and was full of agitations on its pedestal. Then,
the priests, carrying it on their shoulders, it pushed and
turned them on all sides, and the high-priest interrogat-
ing it on all sorts of affairs, if it refused to consent, it drove
the priests back; if otherwise, it made them advance.
Suetonius says, That, some months before the birth of
Augustus, an Oracle was current, importing, that “ Na-
ture was labouring at the production of a King, who
ivould be Master of the Roman empire that the senate,
in great consternation, bad forbidden the rearing of any
male children who should be born that year ; but that
the senators, whose wives were pregnant, found means
to hinder the inscribing of the decree in the public re-
gisters. It seems that the prediction, of which Augustus
DIRECTIONS, &c. xix
was only the type, regarded the birth of Jesus Christ, the
Spiritual King of the whole world ;
or, that the Wicked
Spirit was willing, to dispose Herod, by this example,
to involve the Messiah in the massacre that was made by
his orders of all the children of two years and under.
The whole world was then full of the expectation of the
Messiah’s coming. We see, by Virgil’s fourth Eclogue,
that he applies to the son of the Consul Asinius Pollio’
the prophecies, which from the Jews had then passed
into foreign nations. This child, the object of Virgil’s
flattery, died the ninth day after he was born. Tacitus,
Suetonius, and Josephus, applied to Vespasian the pro-
phecies that regarded the Messiah.
Thus, whilst the Oracles of the Demons deceived the
idolatrous nations, truth had retired among the chosen
people of God. The Septuagint has interpreted Urim and
Thummim, to be manifestation and truth, hhvo--»
which expresses how different those divine Ora-
cles were from the equivocal Oracles of Demons. It is
said in the book of Numbers, “ that Eleazar, the succes-
sor of Aaron, shall interrogate Urim in form,
and that a
resolution shall be taken according to the answer given.”
The ephod applied to the chest on the sacerdotal vest-
ments of the high-priest, was a piece of stuff covered with
twelve precious stones, on which the names of the twelve
tribes were engraved. It was not allowed to consult the
Lord by Urim and Thummim, but for the King, the Pre-
sident of the Sanhedrim,
the General of the Army, and
other ‘public persons, and on affairs that regarded the ge-
XX DIRECTIONS, &c.
neral interest of the nation. If the affair was to succeed,
the stones of the ephod emitted a sparkling light ; or the
high-priest, inspired, predicted the success. Josephus,
who was born thirty years after Christ, says, “ That it
was then two hundred years since the stones of the ephod
had given an answer to consultations by their extraor-
dinary lustre.”
The Scriptures inform us, only, that Urim and Thum-
mim were something that Moses had put in the high-
priest’s breast-plate. Some rabbins, by rash conjectures,
have believed that they were two small figures hidden
within the breast-plate; others, the ineffable name of God,
graved in a mysterious manner. If the Urim and
Thummim did not make answer, it was a sign of God’s
anger. Saul, abandoned by the Spirit of the Lord, con-
sulted it in vain, and obtained no sort of answer.
Several passages of the Scripture leave room to be-
lieve, that an articulate voice came forth from the Pro-
pitiatory, or Holy of Holies, beyond the veil of the taber-
nacle ;
and that this voice was heard by the high-priest.
It appears likewise by some passages of St. John’s Gospel,
that, in the time of Christ, the exercise of the Chief-
priest-hood was still attended with the gift of prophecy.
The cessation of Oracles is attested by several profane
authors, as Strabo, Juvenal, Lucan, and others. Plu-
tarch accounts for the cause of it,—either that the bene-
fits of the gods are not eternal as themselves are, or that
the genii, who presided over Oracles, are subject to
death.
DIRECTIONS, &c. XXI
Suidas, Nicephorus, and Cedrenus relate, that Augus-
tus, having consulted the Oracle of Delphos, could obtain
no other answer than this :
“ The Hebrew child whom
all the gods obey, drives me hence, and sends me back to
hell :
get out of this temple without speaking one word.”
Suidas adds, that Augustus dedicated an altar in the
Capitol, with this inscription :
“ To the eldest son of God !’’
Plutarch relates, that the pilot Tharnus heard a voice
in the air, crying out, “ The great Pan is dead T Where-
on Eusebius observes, that the accounts of the death of
the Demons were frequent in the reign of Tiberius, when
Christ drove out the wicked spirits. The same judgment,
however, may be passed on Oracles as on possessions.—It
was on particular occasions, by the divine permission,
that the Christians cast out devils, or silenced oracles, in
the presence, and even by the confession of the Pagans
themselves. And thus it is that we should understand
the passages of St. Jerome, Eusebius, Cyril, Theodore,
Prudentius, and other authors, who said, *'
That the
coming of Christ had imposed silence on them T—For, in
the case of the present Oracle, the Reader may perceive,
(as I have related in the Preface,) that it not only ob-
tained great celebrity among the ancient Jews and Gen-
tiles, but also preserved its reputation for a faithful ad-
herence to truth, amidst all the revolutions and civil com-
motions which have agitated the world, —not only from
the Babylonish captivity until the birth of Christ,—but
even from that era, until the present day.
