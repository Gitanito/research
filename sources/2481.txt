Pnmsrnss or THE Occum: MADAME BLAVATSKY by Gertrude
Marvin Williams is one more effort to attack and defame the life
and name of H. P. B. As is always the case, each attack brings to the
front defenders, not all members of or associated with any Theosophi-
cal Society. Meniand women of independent thought and strong
sense of justice resent muck-raking “biographies,” especially when the
victim is no longer alive to refute the charges.
Mrs. Williams’ book has called forth many letters of condemnation
from Theosophists and non-Theosophists alike. The following letter
addressed to Mrs. Williams is one. It does not by any means cover
the entire subject; a volume could be written —- and probably will
be — taking Mrs. Williams’ work to pieces point by point. Mr.
Carrithers’ excellent letter covers but a few of the points which make
the book vulnerable. , _ .
While the editors of Theosophical University Press are in full
sympathy with all defences of H. P. B., they cannot be responsible
for the wording of a private or open letter of any friend of the Great
Theosophist.
As long as attacks on the personality of Madame Blavatsky stir
lovers of Truth and the Ancient Wisdom to scholarly and enthusiastic
rebuttal, we may safely say: Madame, your last incarnation has not
been a failure! -

Owmo to the fact that the popular press has almost unanimously
boycotted all facts in favor of H. P. Blavatsky, and that the
writer himself was unable to undertake the independent publication
of this material, The Truth about Madame Blavatsky was ﬁrst sub-
mitted to the leading Theosophical publishing houses of America.
The writer wishes to extend impartial thanks to all of those who,
though unable to aid his literary endeavor, have volunteered their
advice and best wishes.*
But above all, he wishes to commend the Theosophical University
Press for its whole-hearted support of this opportune tribute to
H. P. Blavatsky on the 70th Anniversary of her ﬁrst literary work,
Isis Unveiled. To every Theosophist, it will be signiﬁcant that the
scurrilous barrage under discussion was launched at H. P. B. in the
seventh year of the tenth septenary cycle of her ﬁrst publication!
Regardless of belief or afﬁliation, Theosophists everywhere must
unite in that one universal conviction: The entire innocence of
H. P. B.
All admirers of H. P. Blavatsky, all lovers of Truth, all vigilant
inquirers everywhere, must make that one afﬁrmation an undying
ﬂame at that great martyr’s shrine!

Preface
O
WING to the fact that the popular press has almost unanimously
boycotted all facts in favor of H.P. Blavatsky, and that the
writer himself was unable to undertake the independent publication
of this material, The Truth about ~Madame Blavatsky was first sub-
mitted to the leading Theosophical publishing houses of America.
The writer wishes to extend impartial thanks to all of those who,
though unable to aid his literary endeavor, have volunteered their
advice and best wishes.*
But above all, he wishes to commend the Theosophical University
Press for its whole-hearted support of this opportune tribute to
H.P. Blavatsky on the 70th Anniversary of her first literary work,
Isis Unvei/,ed. To every Theosophist, it will be significant that the
scurrilous barrage under discussion was launched at H.P. B. in the
seventh year of the tenth septenary cycle of her first publication!
Regardless of belief or affiliation, Theosophists everywhere must
unite in that one universal conviction: The entire innocence of
H.P.B.
All admirers of H.P. Blavatsky, all lovers of Truth, all vigilant
inquirers everywhere, must make that one affirmation an undying
flame at that great martyr's shrine!

Introduction
THIS pamphlet is a reply to Priestess of the Occult (Gertrude
Marvin Williams, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1946). It is a discus-
sion of certain well-known, but illegitimate, methods of journalism.
It is a direct and unequivocal refutation (based on irrevocable fact
and evidence) of baseless charges and ﬁctitious histories. And it is a
challenge to specious editorial policies and questionable publishing
practices. .
Gertrude Marvin Williams, in her biographical work, has at-
tempted to portray the life of Madame Blavatsky. It will be shown
that her attempt was not, apparently, made in good faith — for, un-
fortunately, her literary data has been built of the debris that seventy
years of slander have cast up on the sands of time. She has made
charges of the gravest nature. But, as the reader will see, these
charges are here met fully and fairly on the judgment of proof, and
utterly discredited!
Further than this, however, counter-charges are directed against
Mrs. Williams and her propaganda-agents, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. —

dence has been made. "N at only has the refutation-evidence received

of the most deeply wronged women known to history!” WHAT she
was is the problem of the question and charges at hand. WHo she
was is easily stated.
Helena Petrovna Blavatsky was the Founder of the Theosophical
Movement; the literary-source of modern Occult Philosophy; and,
without doubt, the most dynamic Woman and the most baffling
character of the Nineteenth Century.
In less than sixteen years, with world psychology at the zenith
of a mechanistic-materialism, H. P. Blavatsky, almost alone and un-
aided, threw open the gates of Western speculation to the profound-
est spiritual philosophies of the East.
Challenging alike dogmatic science and bigoted theology, H. P. B.
(as she was called by her students) advanced the most disquieting
claims before that Victorian age. She declared that she brought a
message from Tibet to the Western world, a teaching that is “the
sub-stratum and basis of all world-religions and philosophies, taught
and practiced by a few elect ever since man became a thinking
being.”1 She maintained that this Primordial Wisdom, this Theo-
sophia or “Divine Knowledge” survives in its original virginity,
tended by the devotion of certain Eastern Adepts, Mahatmas, liv-
ing Sages who have pursued the evolution of human nature to the
extremities of spiritual perfection. She reafﬁrmed the reality of
ancient Magic, illustrating with apt demonstration the analogies of
Theurgy and the supernormal phenomena of modern Spiritualism.
But the immediate discussion is not one of philosophical exposi-
tion — but the charge of her critics that Madame Blavatsky was a
charlatan!
The charge is neither new nor original with Priestess of the
Occult. The accusation hounded H. P. B. from the founding of her
Theosophical Society to the day of her demise — and, when her ever-
pungent pen was stilled in self-defence by death, the volley of im-
putation increased ten-fold. It has been alleged by an endless pro-
cession of ferocious critics that Madame Blavatsky was, among less
gentle things, a French adventuress, a Russian spy, an embezzler, a
blackmailer, a forger, a plagiarist, a drunkard, a dope ﬁend, a fraud-
ulent Spiritist medium, a Satanist, an atheist, a Jesuit, and a bigamist.

Madame Blavatsky’s apologists contend, with some reason, that
her foes, unable to stem the irresistible logic of her philosophy and
the intractable vitality of her pen, have struck the foulest of all
blows — and have sought to discredit her writings by personal de-
famation.
Gertrude Marvin Williams, former newspaper journalist and self-
appointed “cult” doctor or critic, is the latest scribe to nurse some
of the more intelligible of these imposing charges. Her book would
hardly merit any attention were it not a veritable encyclopedic reiter-
ation of accusation. Mrs. Williams has consumed 354 pages with a
grand and splashing panorama of infamy. The six great, concluding
allegations of her pretentious “research” are that:
I. Madame Blavatsky’s claim to having visited Tibet was a
“smoke-screen” to obscure her “scandalous conduct.” (See Priest-
ess of the Occult, p. 26.)
II. Madame Blavatsky’s most formidable claim to recognition,
her literature, is dismissed by “scholars” as “inaccurate plagiarisms,”
and is the product of a ludicrous “fumbling” with Eastern Philo-
sophy. (Ibid., pp. 209-11.)
III. Madame Blavatsky’s claim of special knowledge and powers
for “Tibetan Adepts” is an “imposition on credulity.” ( I bid., p. 30.)
IV. Madame Blavatsky’s life was not “chaste in the austere paths
of Occultism,” but was a riot of lust and ignominy. ( I bid., p. 7.)
V. Madame Blavatsky was “exposed” in “ﬂagrant fraud” by the
English Society for Psychical Research; and one of her “confeder-
ates,” a Mme. Coulomb, produced Madame’s own letters to substan-
tiate the “exposure.” (Ibid., pp. 10 and 230.)
VI. Madame Blavatsky’s allegiance to “Mahatmas” or “Masters”
was only play, since the “messages and letters from Masters” were
her own deceitful handiwork. ( I bid., p. 165.)
Mrs. Williams summarizes H. P. B.’s life as a “musky” morass
of “ . . . scandals, shadows of lovers dead and gone, bigamous
marriages, an illegitimate son, fraud and trickery de luxe.”

with the accumulated “evidence” of all previous critics, PROVED
her charges against H. P. Blavatsky? What examination will the
basic conclusions of her book bear? And is there any unquestionable
proof to the contrary?
With these questions in mind, the writer unsuccessfully attempted
to engage the author and her publishers in open correspondence re-

December 13, 1946, I dispatched the following registered air-mail
letter to the author. With the addition of explanatory footnotes, it

The Exposure of an “Expose”
GERTRUDE MARVIN WILLIAMS, December 10’ 1946'
c/o Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.,
501 Madison Ave,
New York City.
Dear Madame:
After prolonged consideration, and on the advice of the Editors
of Newsweek Magazinez I am writing in regard to your current
book, Priestess of the Occult. Although you are undoubtedly aware
of most of the following facts and questions, I only anticipate that
my own observations may sustain previous objections.
To the casual reader, your detailed biography of H. P. Blavat-
sky gives evidence of sincerity of scholarship and accomplishment.
But from an intimate examination, it reveals only a superﬁcial ap-
pearance of ﬁnality.
Hugh D. Beach of Newsweek Magazine assures me that you
maintain:
“Theosophists never attempted to dispute my statements about
Besant nor can they in regard to Blavatsky. They are annoyed be-
cause my research brings into the open matters which they try to
forget. I have tried to be scrupulously fair and to be considerate of
devotees. My books are carefully documented. . . .”3
The idea that Theosophists (or, perhaps, anyone else for that
matter) can never dispute your beliefs regarding Mme. Blavatsky
is only a naive, personal assumption on your part — what a psycho-
logist might call a “wish-fantasy.” N 0 one is annoyed because your
“research” brings into the open any perturbing matters. These
“matters” are well-worn by now, and can always be competently
2. Vide Letter of reply, dated December 5, 1946. “If you would like to
continue this discussion any further, we would suggest that you write to Mrs.
Williams herself. . . . Hugh D. Beach for the Editors of Newsweek magazine,

Dear Madame:
December 10, 1946.
After prolonged consideration, and on the advice of the Editors
of Newsweek Magazine2
I am writing in regard to your current
book, Priestess of the Occult. Although you are undoubtedly aware
of most of the following facts and questions, I only anticipate that
my own observations may sustain previous objections.
To the casual reader, your detailed biography of H.P. Blavat-
sky gives evidence of sincerity of scholarship and accomplishment.
But from an intimate examination, it reveals only a superficial ap-

answered by well-informed “devotees.” Their current re-presenta-
tion is only a re-hash of previous “biographies” — with a special
debt evidentially due to Carl Eric Bechofer-Roberts and his blas-
phemously foul The Mysterious Madame (Brewer & Warren, 1931).
As to the “careful” documentation of your book, it appears that
the author herself, indeed! is the one who “wishes to forget” — and
has really already forgotten certain “matters.” Consider the follow-
ing undeniable facts, quite signiﬁcantly and prudently missing from
Priestess of the Occult:
I. H. P. B.’s TRAVELS IN TIBET
Writing in 1883, H. P. B. says, “I have lived in different periods
in Little Tibet as well as in Great Tibet, and these combined periods
form more than seven years. . . . I have stopped in Lamaistic con-
vents, visited Shigatse, the Tashi-Lumpo territory and its neighbor-
hood, and have been further into, and visited such places of Tibet
as have never been visited by other Europeans.”“
You class these claims under the order of hashish delirium or
blatant imposture. But it is interesting to note some of the many
facts, necessarily suppressed by your book!
Your “biography” fastidiously by-passes the fact that, after
Mme. Blavatsky’s deathf’ Major-General C. Murray (in 1854, Cap-
tain of Her Majesty’s Sebundy Sappers and Miners at Punkabaree,
beyond Darjeeling on the borders of Nepal) testiﬁed in a sworn affi-

answered by well-informed "devotees." Their current re-presenta-
tion is only a re-hash of previous "biographies" - with a special
debt evidentially due to Carl Eric Bechofer-Roberts and his blas-
phemously foul The Alysterious Madame (Brewer & Warren, 1931).
As to the "careful" documentation of your book, it appears that
the author herself, indeed! is the one who "wishes to forget" - and
has really already forgotten certain "matters." Consider the follow-
ing undeniable facts, quite significantly and prudently missing from
Priestess of the Occult:
I. H.P. B.'s TRAVELS IN TIBET
Writing in 1883, H.P. B. says, "I have lived in different periods
in Little Tibet as well as in Great Tibet, and these combined periods
form more than seven years. . . . I have stopped in Lamaistic con-
vents, visited Shigatse, the Tashi-Lumpo territory and its neighbor-
hood, and have been further into, and visited such places of Tibet
as have never been visited by other Europeans."4
You class these claims under the order of hashish delirium or
blatant imposture. But it is interesting to note some of the many
facts, necessarily suppressed by your book!
Your "biography" fastidiously by-passes the fact that, after
Mme. Blavatsky's death,5
Major-General C. Murray (in 1854, Cap-
tain of Her Majesty's Sebundy Sappers and Miners at Punkabaree,
beyond Darjeeling on the borders of Nepal) testified in a sworn affi-
davit that he had detained H.P. Blavatsky in an attempted penetra-
tion of Tibet - "to gather material for a book, as she said."6
Equally ignored is the testimony of Major Cross, Managing Proc-
tor to estates of His Majesty, the Dalai Lama of Tibet, who in 1927
on a home visit from the East, declared that he had " . . . traced
the progress of a white woman in 1867, through the most difficult
country of Tibet to a lamasery in the far north, through the recol-

substantiate her claims, for fear of exposing them before the prejudiced blast of
public ridicule - she suffered, uncredited, in silence!

lections of various old natives who were impressed by the personal-
ity of this unusual visitor. . . .” He identiﬁed her with Madame
Blavatsky.’
Here is proof of prime importance — skillfully left unmentioned
by a supposed biographer! Why? Because neither testimony can
be explained away on a wretched hypothesis of fraud! General
Murray’s testimony was published at the time of his declaration, and
he never retracted his statement. It cannot be excused on objections
of “forgery” or ﬁction — nor would a high ofﬁcer of the elite of
British India publicly lie to gratify strangers, the ostracized devotees
of a public-condemned “accomplished, ingenious, and interesting
imposter.” No critic has ever sought to assail the character of C.
Murray; no skeptic has ever challenged his assertion; and Gertrude
Marvin Williams very conveniently forgets it! !
Beyond this, the same holds true in the case of Major Cross.
There are, moreover, still living in Canada, those who witnessed his
declaration — and we leave the assassination of these witnesses to
future, more imaginative “biographers”!
This is a fact that, by itself, impugns the very veracity of your
book. Here is a fact that bears the most vital relationship to Mme.
Blavatsky’s claims, to her subsequent career, and to her entire life
work. That she was the ﬁrst white woman to penetrate Tibet” —
and that alone; that at twenty-three, she was the youngest European
ever to assault those Himalayan gates (“in quest of those Great
Teachers beyond the Snowy Range,” as she said) — all of this is a
fact proven on irrefutable testimony!
II. H. P. B.’s WRITINGS
In her great works, Isis Unveiled, The Secret Doctrine, The
Voice of the Silence et al., H. P. Blavatsky asserted that she was,
under the instruction of certain Tibetan Initiates, giving to the West-
ern World certain essential tenets of a great secret tradition, hitherto
partially concealed under the bonds of arcane darkness. As a re-
viewer summarizes it, you declare this to be sheer “poppycock” and

III. TIBETAN ADEPTS
Priestess of the Occult cites the testimony of W. W. Rockhill as
proof that the existence of a great Tibetan brotherhood of Initiates
is a hashish pipe dream. Tibetan lamas are supposed to have assured
him that no such order of Sages now exists and that “ . . . not even
the wisest and most revered among them possessed such [super
physical] power today. . . .” (Priestess of the Occult, p. 30.)
If the lamas told Rockhill that, they must have had good reasons
for resenting his profane snooping into their private affairs. H. P. B.
declared more than sixty years ago that no lama would ever admit
a curious inﬁdel into their secrets and sanctuaries — no Gelugpa
would do meipo or magic for the profane, or beyond the precincts of
the lamasery. One lama, perhaps only a little less ignorant than those
he professes to teach, could reveal nothing. Another, if he be an
Initiated Lama, would not!
That Rockhill, or anyone else, has failed to ﬁnd Madame Blavat-
sky’s Adepts in Tibet is proof of nothing. One of these Masters him-
self wrote, “Those whom we desire to know us will ﬁnd us at the very
frontiers. (Others) . . . would not ﬁnd us were they to go to
L’hassa with an army!”“ Rockhill’s “evidence” is as assumptive
12. It is signiﬁcant that Madame Blavatsky is the only Western scholar or
religious leader ever to have received the endorsement or cooperation of the
High Priests of the Norther n and Southern Schools of Buddhism (Tibet and
Ceylon), as well as the support of the leading native pandits of India. See

As noted, the above is a translation from the German — and
so, of course, your sly trap set for an unwary reader is simply a
farce, for the Doctor’s name is not misspelt but only an obvious
Anglicized rendition! It was pointed out at the time that the con-
cluding phrase regarding “gynaecological illness,” in the original,
nulliﬁed any possibility of miscarriage, etc. Hence, this is all dis-
tinct proof that H. P. Blavatsky never had a child — except in the
befouled fancy of scandal-mongering, 19th-Century viliﬁers!“
(Document now in the archives of the Theosophical Society at
Adyar, Madras, India.)2°
Your theory of forgery is absurdly stupid. Drs. Oppenheim,
Roeder, Schleiden, as well as Gebhard, were fully aware of this
document. It was made public during their lifetimes and after

We the undersigned hereby certify that the
above is a correct translation of the German
original now before us. \Vi.irzburg,
November 4, 1885.
(Signed) Hlibbe-Schleiden
(Signed) Franz Gebhard. "
As noted, the above is a translation from the German - and
so, of course, your sly trap set for an unwary reader is simply a
farce, for the Doctor's name is not misspelt but only an obvious
Anglicized rendition! It was pointed out at the time that the con-
cluding phrase regarding "gynaecological illness," in the original,
nullified any possibility of miscarriage, etc. Hence, this is all dis-
tinct proof that H.P. Blavatsky never had a child - except in the
befouled fancy of scandal-mongering, 19th-Century vilifiers!19
(Document now in the archives of the Theosophical Society at
Adyar, Madras, India.)20
Your theory of forgery is absurdly stupid. Drs. Oppenheim,
Roeder, Schleiden, as well as Gebhard, were fully aware of this
document. It was made public during their lifetimes and after
H. P. B.'s death. It is dealt with at length in the letters of the Coun-
tess Wachtmeister, widow of the Swedish ambassador to London,
as well as in other contemporary literature.21
In 1892, Mme. Blavatsky received an unconditional, public re-
traction of libel from the then most influential of American news-
papers, The New York Sun.22
The paper's legal staff, inspired by all
the resourcefulness of its brilliant Elihu Root, " ... before Judge
Beach of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, confessed in
19. Regarding the obscure origin of these perennial slanders, V. S. Solovioff,
H.P. B.'s most virulent "exposer," wrote, "This is how it came: she had wished
to save the honour of a friend, and had adopted the child of this friend as her
own. She never parted from him, she educated him herself, and called him
her son in the face of the world." See A Modern Priestess of Isis, p. 141.

open court their inability to prove their charge of immorality. . .”2i'
As the Editors of the Sun conceded in their pages, charges of im-
morality were “without solid foundation . . . not sustained by evi-
dence.” Thus the only time the question came to legal-court, the
traducers recanted!
If Mme. Blavatsky ever assured Prof. Aksakov that any “ru-
mours of immorality” that he chanced to hear were true, it was for
an obvious and diplomatic reason. She was working and battling
day and night in the vanguard of American Spiritualism “for what
little truth there is in it,” surrounded by the elite of that army -
Sargent, Lippett, Owens, and the others —- she could not afford to be
drawn into any racketing controversy over trivialities and personal
recriminations in an hour of such public crisis. She could only have
vindicated herself by implicating Aksakov’s personal friend, Baron
Meyendorﬁ, in the ﬁrst instance — while in the second, his relative
and her old and bitter enemy, D. D. Home, stood ready at the Pro-
fessor’s ear anxious to whisper new viliﬁcations! Rather than scan-
dalize the movement in the eyes of the public, or feed fodder to the
asinine scribes of mockery, she sacriﬁced herself -—- and kept silence.
Why is this dossier of facts missing from Priestess of the Occult,
any informed reader can ask. Simply because it is an unshakable
contravention to the yellow-journal fables, rescued from a morgue
of dead slanders by a hasty scribe!
V. THE S. P. R.’s “ExPosURE”
Lastly, Priestess of the Occult, with its volley of allegation, is
no more proof of “fraudulent conjuring palmed off as ‘divine mir-
acles’ ” than was Richard Hodgson’s devious Proceedings No. IX
of the Society for Psychical Research! In every paragraph ever
written on the occult phenomena of this strange Russian woman,
NOT ONE SINGLE FACT OF FRAUD WAS EVER OFFERED!

“exposure,” you attempt to build a wall of infallibility around this
general of the prosecution.“ But with all of his ﬁne personal recom-

scientists that he brought upon his own head by his wild surmises
and laughable “detections”!
Psychical Research as a science has advanced far into those ﬁelds
once pioneered by H. P. B. — since Hodgson stomped across the
stage! You fail to recall that he made a fool of himself more than
once in that domain, precisely the particular subject of the “Blavat-
sky Case," viz., physical supernormal phenomena!
Read what one of the most eminent investigators of Europe had
to say on the matter:
“ . . . I have not been able to agree with the assertions of the
English investigators (Sidgwick, Hodgson, and the conjuror, Maske-
lyne of London, 1895-6) that she [Eusapia Paladino] worked with
small apparatus smuggled into the sitting. I not only examined her
dress with a ruler before every sitting, or had a special dress made
for her, but I also had occasion to examine her whole luggage down
to the last needle. Not the slightest suspicious objects, such as are
required by every conjuror, could be discovered. . . . Eusapia
Paladino’s performances have been examined several times by emi-
nent conjurors (such as Rybka of Warsaw on the 13th December,
1893), and have been acknowledged in their written testimony.
Thus the famous American conjuror, M. Howard, [Thurston], said
the following on the occasion of Eusapia’s sittings in America: —
“ ‘I have been a conjuror all my life, and up to now have exposed
numerous mediums who produced physical phenomena, but I am
convinced that this medium (Eusapia), actually produced elevations
of the table, and I undertake to contribute a thousand dollars to a
charity if anyone can prove to me that Eusapia is unable to raise a
table into the air without trick, without fraud and without help,
excluding the use of fraudulent manipulations of knees or feet or
any other part of her body or utensils!’ ”25
Thurston was introduced to Paladino by Dr. Hereward Carring-
ton, now Director of the American Psychical Research Institute and

But in the problem at hand, you overlook the fact that Hodgson’s
own evidence belies the much-ﬂaunted “accuracy.” As a case in

The two chief witnesses of the S. P. R. were Mme. Coulomb and
V. S. Solovioff.” The chief witness of Mme. Blavatsky was Col.
H. S. Olcott. Now Hodgson’s ﬁrst witness testiﬁes, “ . . . Col. Ol-
cott was not a confederate in any of these frauds of Mme. Blavatsky
but the victim of credulity.”31 Hodgson, careful not to discredit
this valuable witness by any fabulous speculations of his own, agrees,
“I must state with emphasis that it is not my opinion that Col. Olcott
has taken any deliberate and active part in this fraud.”32
But now comes the dénouement: the S. P. R.’s second star wit-
ness, Solovioff, brought to court ten years after their ﬁrst self-judged
trial had miscarried, blandly testiﬁes, “Madame Blavatsky told me

30. Solovioff proved a poor witness for the S. P. R. when he speciﬁcally
nulliﬁed Hodgson’s climaxing hypothesis, i.e., that Blavatsky was an undercover
agent of the Czar, scheming to overthrow British rule in India. Hodgson gave
pages of “valuable evidence” to prove his charge, which he considered the only
possible explanation for her enduring sacriﬁces and hardships. Solovioff labeled
the charge “baseless and impossible.” See p. 114 A Modern Priestess of Isis, by
V. S. Solovioff, abridged and translated on behalf of the S. P. R. by Walter Leaf,
with an Introduction by H. Sidgwick. London, 1895. The charge was an obvious
appeal by Hodgson for political hysteria to rescue his ﬂimsy “case” from obscur-
ity-—-much as were Gertrude Marvin Williams’ breath-bated whisperings about
Theosophical “swastikas” and Nazi “Aryans”! Hodgson’s “evidence was as
valuable here as it was elsewhere”!

psychic phenomena of H. P. B. It appointed a Committee for that purpose. But
neither did the Committee do any investigating. It appointed an agent, Richard
Hodgson, but neither did he investigate the phenomena—for the phenomena
in question had taken place months (and often years) before! He gathered

of Mme. Coulomb's husband, a professional carpenter; that the engineering had
been done without H.P. B.'s knowledge and in her absence when the Coulombs
had exclusive access to her quarters; and that the entire scheme was a crude at-

expunged from it every reference to “Mahatma Letters”!! The
fact is that no expert, no professional caligraphist, has ever publicly
proclaimed the Mahatma Letters to be forgeriesl! All of the decla-

parison is made with Mme. Coulomb’s own handwriting, no cali-

identiﬁed by N ethercli ft! ”
Again, if it could not be proven that the Mahatma Letters were
in a script and grammar wholly dissimilar to H. P. B.’s own writing,
still there would be no proof whatever that the said letters were not
messages from extraneous Teachers. It is quite obvious that the
critics know little about the subject at hand, and even less about the
subject-problem in general. When Hodgson ﬁrst advanced his “as-
sumed script” theory, Psychical Research was in its ignorant infancy
— and Hodgson, one of the newly-born babes. Listen to what James
H. Hyslop, PH.D., LL.D., Secretary of the American Society for Psychi-

versity, had to say in his book, Life After Death (E. P. Dutton &

“The careful psychic researcher always admits the message,
whatever its origin, comes through the mind of the medium and is
colored by it in the transmission, whether by interpretation, con-
scious or unconscious, or by the habits of the organism itself. [Italics
mine. W. A. C.] He always expects the theory of their origin to be
qualiﬁed by these inﬂuences. . . . He does not expect any intelli-
gent person to read the facts as if they were living communications
or telegrams. He expects the reader has some intelligence above a

the highest terms of praise about her literary gifts. . . . And why
not mention that her Russian publishers offered her an exclusive
contract on the favorable terms as granted only one other author,
the celebrated Turgenev, (an offer, incidentally, which she rejected
on her Tibetan Teacher’s orders — so she could write, unproﬁtably,
for Theosophy! )5”
Plainly enough, she had no need to resort to tedious copywork,
especially if she were “weary”!
“However startling and impracticable the theory, that two per-
sons, who have (it is alleged) been clever enough to carry on unde-
tected the fraud of personating for ﬁve years several adepts — not
one of whom resembles the other; —- two persons, one of whom, at
any rate, is a fair master of English (Sinnett) and can hardly be

collections” that are manifestly contrary to fact, and recites his parade of “old
rumors” that are related without corroboration or proof of any kind! There
are only two instances which Witte mentioned that by his own account rested
on his own knowledge. The ﬁrst was his visits to Mme. Blavatsky’s ﬂower
shop; and the second — Mrs. Williams very conveniently fails to mention--
“On one occasion she (H. P. B. ) caused a closed piano in an adjacent room to
emit sounds as if invisible hands were playing upon it. This was done in my
presence, at the instance of one of the guests. . . . Let him who still doubts the
non-material origin and the independent existence of the soul in man consider
the personality of Mme. Blavatski. During her earthly existence, she housed a
spirit which was, no doubt, independent of physical or physiological being. . . . I
cannot help feeling that there was something demoniac in that extraordinary

the highest terms of praise about her literary gifts. . . .''51
And why
not mention that her Russian publishers offered her an exclusive
contract on the favorable terms as granted only one other author,
the celebrated Turgenev, (an offer, incidentally, which she rejected
on her Tibetan Teacher's orders - so she could write, unprofitably,
for Theosophy! )52
Plainly enough, she had no need to resort to tedious copywork,
especially if she were "weary"!
"However startling and impracticable the theory, that two per-
sons, who have (it is alleged) been clever enough to carry on unde-
tected the fraud of personating for five years several adepts - not
one of whom resembles the other; - two persons, one of whom, at
any rate, is a fair master of English (Sinnett) and can hardly be
51. Mrs. Williams "carefully documents" her book by omitting Witte's "re-
collections" that are manifestly contrary to fact, and recites his parade of "old
rumors" that are related without corroboration or proof of any kind! There
are only two instances which Witte mentioned that by his own account rested
on his own knowledge. The first was his visits to Mme. Blavatsky's flower
shop; and the second - Mrs. Williams very conveniently fails to mention· -
"On one occasion she (H.P. B. ) caused a closed piano in an adjacent room to
emit sounds as if invisible hands were playing upon it. This was done in my
presence, at the instance of one of the guests. . . . Let him who still doubts the
non-material origin and the independent existence of the soul in man consider
the personality of Mme. Blavatski. During her earthly existence, she housed a
spirit which was, no doubt, independent of physical or physiological being. . . . I
cannot help feeling that there was something demoniac in that extraordinary
woman." (See Memoirs, New York, 1921, pp. 5-10.) Witte was decidedly "criti-
cal," and relates that as a young boy, "I looked on them as mere sleight-of-
band performances." But his mature conclusion was that there was "something
demoniac" and independent of the physical in the strange phenomena! See
