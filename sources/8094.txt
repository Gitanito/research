  		              		Experience Description   

    I come from what most would consider a large family extended. We are Strong, Successful, Loving, Gifted, well known and loved by the community that surrounds us. I being the only girl and youngest of three children had a love for music and singing and meeting new people with open arms with no judgment. I was a good girl but very naive. I experienced trauma as a child from my birth mother and her bad decision-making and when she periodically showed up in my life. That is the only sense I can make or relate to the events that unfolded and changed my life forever.

  I was a young adult when my mother came back into my life after many years absent due to drug addiction and mental health problems. She convinced me to move in with her to help take care of her, I agreed. After a few years with her and minimal contact with my dad step mom and brothers, I needed to escape my living situation and started sleeping at friends' houses. I was asked one day to come check out a studio in a friend of a friend's basement to sing on an album they were making, that is where I met Bobby, who kept me imprisoned by horrific and constant physical mental and emotional abuse and threatening to kill me for 3 long years. I had no contact with family and right away found out he was in very big trouble with the Marshals and went on the run until finally he was caught. During that time period all I knew was the people or close family he or we were involved with daily, specifically a man named Mike.  When caught he received a 15 year sentence and I reunited with family after treatment and counseling thanks to the brave hardworking team of Marshall's that I will be forever grateful for. 

On April 21st, 2010 I was visiting a friend of mine at her mother's house and she told me she was expecting a few friends over. One of the persons who showed up at her house was Bobby's best friend Mike who I had not seen since before the arrest. He was with two men that I have never met before and they invited me specifically to follow them to their house to hang out. I hesitated but they insisted until I agreed. My friend begged me not to go because she had a bad feeling but I assured her I would be okay. Mike was the only one there for me during the horrible times with Bobby, so I trusted he would take care of me. We left to our destination the guys drove together in one car and I followed alone in mine. 

It was dark and we drove for quite a while, I had no idea where I was. Once there immediately I was offered a drink and I noticed the person who made it took a glass and mixed the drink with his back turned to me facing the top open freezer of the refrigerator. I thought it was odd but shrugged it off. By the time I finished my drink I remembered looking outside and the sun was coming up. I remember in an instant experiencing a feeling of dread come over me so intensely, followed by urgency. Mike was sitting on the sofa by the window next to the front door and I do not know where the other men were. I went to go sit next to Mike on the couch when a loud voice so clear said 'Ashley you need to leave now, get out!'. I looked at Mike and said I have to go now; his response was, 'No that is not a good idea.' He asked me if I was feeling okay and told me it was not safe for me to leave. Unable to convince me to stay he asked me for a ride home. We left and I have a flash of memory of dropping him off and leaving his driveway. 

Next memory I have is I was sitting outside of my car leaned up against my back tire. I remember feeling complete perfect stillness of calming, but no other emotion. I remember I looked up to the sky and it was so warm so bright but there was no sun, just beautiful blue sky. I looked around me and was in a field of gold colored wheat and there were beautiful mountains. I turned my head to the right toward my front tire and there was a woman sitting next to me with a blue and white striped shirt, beautiful curly brown hair and my first thought was she looks like the 80s Era. She was looking at me and crying but I could not feel any response emotion to her crying. I just remember being confused as to why she was crying but there was no physical emotion attached to my confusion 

I just felt one feeling and it was good and calm but my thoughts knew that my feeling when looking at her was that of confusion. She started telling me that everything is going to be okay and it's over now. She was telling me this but her mouth was not moving. She told me it's over I am okay now repeating, it's all done you are okay now. All of the sudden I felt really cold and my focus turned away from her and up in the sky with was now a dark gray and I could hear ambulance sirens in the background. I woke up in the hospital with a neck brace on and the nurse fed me lasagna and green beans. Then someone came in the room and placed fake money on the end of my bed and asked me to add up the coins to a dollar value. I was unable to and felt frustrated. 

The morning of the accident I later learned that the neighbor of the house I was at left for work that morning and found my purse in their yard. They felt something was wrong looked through my purse and found my ID. With no other contact information, the couple who found my purse looked me up on a social media site and linked me to our family's restaurant we were involved with building and working there during the start up. The couple called the restaurant and asked for me but was told I no longer work there. The couple explained they found my purse and immediately my family was notified and my brother called every hospital until he found me. I then found out that the morning of the accident I called my birth mother and told her I was driving down the road with Mike and said that I had a shotgun out the window and I was hunting ducks and I was coming home so she could cook them for me, I then disconnected the call and immediately my mother started praying in what she calls Tongues prayer. When my father came to get me from the hospital I let him know I was okay because this woman was with me the whole time and took care of me. After explaining her to him he looked like all the color drained out of his face. He dug up a few pictures from my baby book to share with me and right away recognized the woman in one of the photos was the one sitting outside my car with me. My dad went on to tell me that her name was Trish, she was my nanny when I was born and lived with us at the faith based home my parents ran called Park House. Trish died in a rollover when I was 1 year old. I also found out that a woman was driving behind me on a stretch of highway the morning of the accident and witnessed my car cross the median unto oncoming traffic where my car then struck a tree and roll down a steep embankment. 

I was not found outside my vehicle I had to be removed from it. I was drugged by Mike and the other two men, that were instructed to put an end to my life, supposedly. A few months after the accident I was in a youth group program that took us to the neighboring State of Wisconsin in the middle of nowhere to attend a Sunday service, the building holds 100 people max. After the service I made my way to the common area for coffee and was approached by a tiny very old lady who introduced herself by saying 'I heard you saw my daughter Trish', 'Trish used to write songs and music, will you find them for me, her poems?' That is all I remember of our conversation. Currently and forever more I am married to my best friend, the love of my life in our home with a job I love so much helping to take care of others, and have never been in a closer relationship with my whole family. Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I hope that even one word I shared will help someone out there.
