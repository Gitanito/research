 The journal and its competitor American Astrology were the leading astrology magazines of the last half of the twentieth century.  When Marion Drew left to edit Dal Lee's Astrology Guide, Grant Lewi (William Grant Lewi, 1902-1951) took over as editor.  He was a one-time professor of English at Columbia University, Dartmouth College and other schools who then, in the 1930s took up astrology, occasionally writing under the name "Scorpio."  He was the author of two of the most influential books on the subject: Heaven Knows What (1935) and Astrology for the Millions (1940).  In 1950 he became editor of the Astrologer, published in Springfield, Massachusetts.  The journal is most notable to non-astrologers for the large selection of  small advertisement that characterized the pulps of the era, advertisements for AMORC, "Earn Extra Money," "Inventors Wanted," "The 7 Keys to Power," rupture cures, "Valley Psychic," "Gypsy Fortune Telling Cards," "Let Candle Burning Light Your Way to Money, Power, Success," "Your Hidden Brain Power," etc.  Contributions by Louis de Wohl, Sydney Omarr, Llewellyn George, et al.
