  		              		Experience Description   

    My mother died and left her body during or shortly after WWII, which was before I was born.  On passing into the next heaven, she was met by two angels.  They told her it was not her time and she was being sent back.  Her purpose was to have  three more children; she had 2 children already. They told her one child would be a Male who would be taken before the Most High. She told me this during one of our short conversations about her life. 

My mother probably would have been perceived as more religious before it.  I perceived her as a positive, gifted, and intuitive woman who attracted other women to and around her.  She did not seem to fit into church-type settings, but was more spiritually sensitive than religious; yet she maintained a strong faith in God.
  
  My mother could not possibly have told anyone about her experience, not even my father. If she had, I cannot imagine this never being discussed within the family. Certainly no one would have imagined it would be me that was mentioned in her experience. They probably would not even believe it. I never heard anything about this story within my family growing up and later in life. She may have been afraid or ashamed to speak about it, having been brought up in a very religious home. She said she had committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills.
  
  In her late 80's, being extremely frail and going into dementia, she was sent to me to be cared for.  When I picked her up at the plane and wheeled her down to get the luggage, she wanted to tip me because she thought  I was the bellhop. I asked her if she recognized me, her son, a few times over the next few months but she would become confused and could not answer. She treated me as if she thought I was an aid, hotel employee or just a caregiver during that time. She often thought she was staying at a hotel and would get stuck paying  a big bill. For this reason, I was careful to not confuse her or create anxiety. She soon went further into dementia and had to be placed in a home for her safety and care.  There never was an opportunity for me to tell her that the prophecy had been fulfilled.
  
  I never mentioned to anyone that I had that STE experience when I was 20 years old up to that time my mom came to me, other than one close friend and a pastor of a church I knew. That seemed to cool the friendship off and the pastor stood up and walked out of my home before I finished telling my experience. The first time I publicly spoke about my STE experience was in 2008 on the NDERF site.  I never thought to tell my mom's side of the story at that time, as it was her story not mine. Recently, I read a NDE where the daughter was sharing her deceased mom's NDE. I realized I should tell her story too, as it may help others connect things up that God has many ways to get our attention. This is about something much bigger and universal than our earthly mind can comprehend.
  
  I originally found the NDERF site after coming to the place of realizing that there is just no way that I could be the only person on earth to have experienced what I did and I needed to find others like me. I am no one special. I am sure many religions would say I do not even measure up to their standards. Life has not been easy either, especially the feeling like I did not fit in anywhere. Everything was pretty much upside down and inside out here compared to the LOVE and ONE-ness I experienced in God's presence.  I can understand now looking back that I was just getting my life 'contract agreement' experiences that I needed to have here in this 'earth suit' so I could choose to master the lessons I signed up for. It's 50 years later and I am just now getting the understanding of what my life 'purpose' is for this 'autumn' time of my life.  My mom's NDE prophecy was fulfilled August 1973 in my 20th year.
