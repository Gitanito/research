 This was produced under the auspices of Franz Hartmann's Internationale Theosophische Verbruderung (ITV)/ Theosophische Gesellschaft in Deutschland (TGiD).  It was broader than Theosophy, with articles on occultism, philosophy, alchemy and metaphysics, all generally reflecting the concerns of Hartmann about the relationship of Theosophy and western, Christian occultism.  The journal contained contributions by or selections from Hugo Vollrath, Dr. Hubbe-Schleiden, Franz Hartmann, Jakob Bohme, Swami Vivekananda, Paul Carus, H.P. Blavatsky, W.Q. Judge, et al.  It also carried a notable and lengthy obituary of Carl Kellner by Hartmann, who opined that Kellner had died of occult causes and lacked maturity by his efforts to find Masters outside the Theosophical Society:

 "Dr. Kellner looked everywhere to increase his knowledge. He occupied a high position in Freemasonry and for several years was a member of a Rosicrucian League, which is mentioned in my book Among the Adepts. He was an idealist and consequently a fanatic; he looked for 'masters' on the outside and therefore fell into the hands of swindlers who praised him for so-called "yoga exercises" and to whom he submitted.  For example, he took lessons from a certain 'Soliman Ben Aisha,' an Arab who could pierce his tongue, take out his eye, eat snakes, and the like, and was also seen in public.  Then he took for his teacher an Indian from Lahore, named 'Bheema Sena Pratapa,' who had the ability to put himself into a sleep similar to apparent death by means of auto-hypnosis and also presented himself at the international congress for psychology taking place in Munich, and finally he placed himself under the leadership of a certain Indian named 'Sri Mahatma Agamya Guru Parahamsa,' who boastfully posed as a saint and 'master of all masters' and was also up to mischief in Berlin.  Dr. Kellner was instructed by this 'Agamya Guru' in the 'science of breath' and other exercises believed that he had arrived at the goal of his desires.  'Finally,' he wrote [me], 'I have found what I have been striving for all my life.'  However, the exercises which he undertook had one result, and this consisted in his attracting a multitude of astral influences, of which he could no longer separate himself could free.  In the room of his laboratory in Vienna, which he had set up for alchemical purposes, hauntings soon began to appear . . . ."  His error, Hartmann opined was in wanting "to enter the temple of diving wisdom through the back door in order to draw down the divine and use it for his own purposes."  Curiously, no mention is made of Theodor Reuss or Kellner's involvement with Memphis-Misraim or the O.T.O.

   The journal featured an extensive question and answer correspondence section on subjects like "Is the Theosophical Society a Yoga School?", "Is it necessary to go to India to be a Theosophist?", "Is ignorance the source of all evil?", etc.  It had as a supplement from October 1903 Hugo Vollrath's Theosophische Rundschau (q.v.), and contained a small dictionary to explain terms and expressions used in it.  Ernst Arthur Weber later published Vivekananda's Practical Vedanta.  In the 1960s another, unrelated Theosophical journal of similar name (Neuer Theosophischer Wegweiser Blatter) was published in Germany.
