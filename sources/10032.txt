I floated into a dark tunnel. I was wearing white clothes. At the end of the tunnel, I saw a shining white light. While I was going through the tunnel, I could hear nice Japanese music. I had never heard Japanese music before but I was very sure that it was a Japanese music. Before I got to the end of the tunnel my consciousness came back to me, my skin was so pale that it looked like death. I was sweltering and I could not raise on my foot, gradually I became normal again.
