  		              		Experience Description   

    In 2018,  a sudden and severe illness put me into a coma and in the  ICU for some time. As I was in a coma, that was the time I felt so close to the other realm. One proverb says, 'People will drift into the places where they are most desired for before their impending death.' I was unconscious and on a ventilator, yet I knew I was dying.     

My consciousness left my body like a stream of thin, green smoke and then I hovered up to the ceiling. I watched the doctors and nurses working on me as I glimpsed down my lifeless body lying still on the hospital bed. Slowly, all my surroundings became smaller and smaller.     

My soul arrived on a hill where the meadow was filled with cute, tiny, brilliant flowers. There was a brick house at the foot of the hill.  My grandmother and I used to live there when I was age five to to age thirteen before my parents brought me home to live with them. This place was peaceful and I felt at ease. Next, I floated to a dim-greenish colored warehouse-like building where it was crowded with so many people.  They were lined up in sequence and marching forward and from my viewpoint, they were not talking to each other. At this moment, I knew I had died. I felt relieved and was indifferent to my children, parents, any worries or burdens.  
  
  Later, we were asked by several guys in uniform to enter into a lobby to wait for a number to be called up.  It reminded me of getting a number and waiting in a bank. One of the uniformed guys told me, 'You are the next, don’t walk about. You have to come forward when it is your turn.' I nodded to silently confirm my understanding. There was a lady standing behind me whom I could not see her face. I could here her saying that she used to drive fancy cars and lived in a mansion. So, she felt no regret after death. She continued to criticize the rest of us for not having nice clothes to wear. Then the people all around me were scolding her, including those in uniforms, saying that she was a mistress who destroyed other people’s families, and that she deserved to be killed in a car accident. I was musing to myself that my life was so boring when compared to hers.   

  One of the guys in uniform came up to me with a list and said, 'What is your name?' I answered, 'I am XiaoYu.” Then he looked at me and said, 'No, not you! You are the one who did not deserve to die yet.' Suddenly, this announcement was repeated through a radio broadcasting, 'It is not your time; you are the least one who deserved to die here.' I was plunged into a wave of blankness afterwards.  

  The scene below me was chaotic. I heard so many beeping sounds coming from the ventilator and monitoring machines in ICU. I was surprised to find out after regaining consciousness, that I had been in coma for 14 days. Several resuscitations were performed on me during the time I was out.   

    Once I was out of critical state, I was moved to a patient ward for the next 15 days before my discharge from the hospital. I would be seen by the doctors near my village. While recovering, I could not walk, was unable to urinate, and was confined to a wheelchair with a catheter on me. During my physical therapy, I thought I might need to pay back my karmas; otherwise, I would be fixed on a wheelchair for the rest of my life until I die again.  

    I had forgotten many things while in coma except for this vivid experience that seemed like it happened yesterday. Later, I had told my story to the religious elders after I was discharged from the hospital.  They told me that I came back because I had not fulfilled my purpose so they let me come back. They also said, 'What you seed and reap. If you plant good causes, you must enjoy prosperity. If you plant the bad causes, you must continue to practice and survive to mend the karmas.'  

  I miraculously got better. Not only can I run super fast, but also I became normal as everybody else at work as well as daily life. Until now, you must think what I had told you was ridiculous and believe me, I felt the same as you do.  I was an atheist who believes that a person's consciousness ceases upon death. You don’t have to believe in God, but you can’t disregard the karmas.
