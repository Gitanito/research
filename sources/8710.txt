  Narratives Responses to Unity Survey Question:    Narrative responses by near-death experiencers to the NDERF survey question below

  Comments:     Introductory comments to near-death experience (NDE)


    This page contains 446 near-death experiences (NDEs) and their responses to the NDERF survey question “During your experience, did you encounter any specific information / awareness that a mystical universal connection or unity/oneness either does (or does not) exist (***experience only)?”  All narrative responses with a “Yes” or “Uncertain” response to this question are included.

      Methodology: 

      Experiences were scored as near-death experiences (NDEs) if they met all of the following:

  1.  A lucid, organized experience occurring at the time of a life-threatening event so severe that there is unconsciousness or clinically apparent death with an absent heartbeat.

  2.  An NDE Scale score of 7 or higher.

  3.  Shared by the individual who personally had the NDE.

  4.  Shared in English via the completed survey form on nderf.org.

  These are NDEs from the most recent version of the NDERF survey (nderf.org). They are sequentially shared NDEs from November 11, 2011 to April 8, 2021. All accounts were scored as NDEs if they met the above criteria and regardless of experience content to avoid bias in studying the content of the NDEs.

    The NDEs posted on the NDERF website are edited to correct obvious spelling and grammar errors. As remarkable as the NDEs are in this list, please remember that they accurately represent the real experiences of near-death experiencers (NDErs) from all walks of life and around the world.  

  We strive to make a larger collection of NDEs that include statements from NDErs about encountering awareness of a mystical unity or oneness during their NDEs. We would be delighted to collaborate in this endeavor with anyone with other credible internet sources of NDErs discussing the mystical unity or oneness that they encountered during thier NDEs.

      This list is public domain and may be used by anyone.

  Substantial efforts are made to minimize the risk of posting fraudulent NDE accounts on nderf.org: See a more detailed explanation. 

  We strive for accuracy in this list. If any NDEs should not be included for any reason, please email us at nderf@nderf.org with the NDE registry number and URL. Thanks!

    Even a brief review of the NDEs below shows that NDErs often encounter awareness of a mystical unity/oneness during their NDEs.  The narrative responses below were directly shared on the NDERF survey without grammatical or spelling corrections.

I was told that if I returned that my life would be filled with trials and hard times and that if I chose to enter the light that I would eventually have to experience rebirth and relive life straight out of the womb. Childhood, adolescent and young adulthood had been very unpleasant. I chose not to push my luck and opted for the here and now. When my decision was made I resumed life back in my body. An ambulance arrived. I rose from the pavement and walked to the gurney. Amazed eyes followed trip with disbelief. I believe one was a priest who had administered last rites.

Exceptional NDE due to blood loss with remarkably transcendent experiences.  		  		  			6137  			Paul S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1paul_s_nde_6137.html  			Just that undeniable feeling of universal love seems to thread through the universe.... it was like momentarily, I was part of that.... is the best way I can think of to explain that sensation.  			NDE due to pulmonary embolus.  		  		  			6138  			Rhonda C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1rhonda_c_nde.html  			There seemed to be no need for bodies or spoken words. Words were just heard. I felt I was not a &quot;form&quot;. perhaps just a consciousness.,  			NDE due to surgical complications and respiratory arrest after surgery.  		  		  			6141  			Harold R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1harold_r_nde.html  			I was aware of a oneness, a connection with God and all the other souls but also individuality.

NDE due to prolonged cardiac arrest.  		  		  			6205  			Isabel R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1isabel_r_nde.html  			That would be that if I didn't go back into my body I would be disrupting some sort of universal situation or plan. On the other hand, no matter what I did, it would be fixed, darned up like a sweater that had a hole in it. I don't understand it too well.

NDE due to cardiac arrest.  		  		  			6233  			Jenneane E NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jenneane_e_nde.html  			I believe in the oneness that I share with other spiritual people. I feel the God energy radiating out of them and we have a common understanding of the positive love energy of God. It overtakes my body physically in the form of goose bumps or chills when it is not a result of a temperature change that is similar to how the skin reacts to cold. I still feel at oneness with God and I will never lose that. We humans live in duality here on Earth but we are not used to that on the other side. We are naturally supposed to live in love and harmony but the negative side of us prevents that when greed, lust and the other seven deadly sins overtake our seven virtues. Their is an invisible energy that most of us cannot see visually. Some spiritual people can see auras around people and can heal them. I can only feel negative and positive energy. I cannot see it. I am sad that people live selfishly and negatively because it damages everything. I hope that with more and more spiritual awakening among people that the love will flow again like it did in the Garden of Eden. Man destroys himself sometimes with negative feelings and thoughts. True love is the most powerful energy and I could only image how beautiful the planet used to be. We are able to heal ourselves with our positive thoughts.  			NDE due to complication of childbirth.  		  		  			6240  			Nancy T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1nancy_t_nde_6240.html  			there was such a merging of love with the female presence that I felt aware of a oneness with her  			NDE at age 13 due to head injury.  		  		  			6241  			Laura L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1laura_l_nde.html  			I know for a fact that we go elsewhere after our earthly bodies are no longer useful to us.  			NDE due to blood loss after delivery.  		  		  			6243  			Dan BC NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1dan_bc_nde.html  			I interpreted the experience to mean that there is some kind of universal connection.  			NDE due to plane accident where 16 out of 22 on the plane were killed. Rare shared NDE where he encountered a friend of his who died in the crash during the NDE.  		  		  			6244  			Steve L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1steve_l_nde.html  			I was one with it  			NDE due to necrotizing pancreatitis.  		  		  			6246  			Natalie S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1natalie_s_nde.html  			In my book ‘Application of Impossible Things’ I describe it this way:  			Exceptional NDE as a result from a roadside bomb in Iraq. Remarkable account of healing and spiritual wisdom.  		  		  			  			  			  			  			  		  		  			  			  			  			The one reality includes all beingness or consciousness. It is the endlessly unknowable infinity of creativity and an apparent paradox of infinite numbers of unique individuals that are simultaneously one. This encompassing connection is within and of, and creates, is created by, and moves through each unique being, and is part of all while also existing separately from what I’ll call “All That Is.”  			  		  		  			  			  			  			This All That Is can be perceived simultaneously as a force and as an individual consciousness that exists within each consciousness and yet is separate from each consciousness or being. It’s what might be referred to as God, but the ideas of gods that we have are a pale and incomplete shadow of the All That Is that I perceive. Projecting an idea of a god or gods upon that infinite creative consciousness inevitably limits an understanding of the All That Is in ways that reflect the severely limited comprehension that we have of ourselves and the physical universe.  			  		  		  			6248  			Lois T NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lois_t_nde.html  			I felt a oneness...so I know it exists.

Shared 53 years later.  		  		  			6267  			Sheila EP NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sheila_ep_nde.html  			Seems like we are each comprised of energy forces, like energy balls, shared among all of us.  			NDE at age 16 due to auto accident and broken neck.  		  		  			6274  			Jill J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jill_j_nde.html  			I learned that a oneness exists. Not anything specific, just a feeling. As if I just knew.

My belief is that while in the light we choose which life to come back as, that these choices will provide us either with the lessons we are to learn or the lessons we are to teach. When we go back to the light I believe that we have an amazing ability to know everything including the lessons we still need to be involved in on earth and that we choose when and how to come back. Not in the way I would choose to have an apple instead of an orange, but a profound understanding of choice and knowledge.
