  		              		Experience Description   

    I stopped to help at a car accident near my office. When I lifted a fallen street light from roof of one of the cars, I was seriously shocked by light pole.

   I went flying backwards in air and was traveling at very high speed through  a dark tunnel. As I was moving the  spot of light at the end of the tunnel grew in size. Then, I was in a large vaulted room with rays of light with golden specks that were suspended in the air like large dust particles. I saw hundreds of people standing around me. My recently deceased mother and my maternal grandmother were with them. I looked them in the eyes and felt at peace. I was led from the room to the outside. It was like an open campus  area in vibrant light. I was led to a figure sitting on a stone.  The stone was an elevated throne with steps leading up to it. I received a message, but can't remember what it was.  
  
   Suddenly, I begin to fall rapidly through the dark.  Below me, I could see a point of light that kept growing as I got closer to it.  I could see it was a street light. I could also see my body lying face down in a pool of blood. I went from feeling light and in no pain to feeling heavy and in intense pain from my injuries. I rolled over and tried to get up. A security guard told me not to move.
