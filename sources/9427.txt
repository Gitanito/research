I saw beings in the form of 'aliens' but these may have been guardian angels lifting me away from earth into this amazing bright light that was like a tunnel. I felt so much love and beauty. It was such a peaceful experience that I did not want to leave. I was given a choice as I was travelling down this tunnel to live or carry on through the tunnel. I was going through a negotiation as to what would happen if I died and how badly it would affect my mother, husband etc. I also saw my future, that I had not experienced having children yet and had a lot more things to accomplish. It was not my time. I remember thinking we live on earth and we are humans and saw from a higher level how we exist on earth. I felt like it wasn't time yet so held my husband next to me and started breathing again and felt myself go back down to earth.
