it seems to me that the Bentwaters
incident is a classic case where an
apparent intrusion into our airspace in
indeed a landing in our country with
witnessed by serious minded people in
the military responsible people doing a
responsible job and Bentwaters is in a
sense a benchmark for how not to deal
with these matters in the future
I know a good bit about the Bentwaters
incident and I&#39;ve read half a dozen
books I&#39;ve interviewed a number of the
people who took part in it and what I
have decided after careful thought and I
have said it in public more than once
before there are only two explanations
of what happened that night in Suffolk
the first is that what the people
concerned including Colonel Holt who was
at the time the deputy commander of the
base and a lot of his soldiers or Airmen
they claimed that something from outside
the Earth&#39;s atmosphere landed at their
Air Force Base they went and stood by it
they inspected it they photographed it
the following day they took tests on the
worth of ground where it had been and
found radioactive traces they reported
this Colonel Holt wrote a memorandum
which was sent to our Ministry of
Defense he has appeared on British
television at least once to my knowledge
possibly more often in which he has
repeated effectively what he said in
that memorandum and what he said is what
I have just described that is one
explanation that it actually happened as
Colonel Holt reported the other
explanation is that it didn&#39;t and in
that case one is born to assume that
Colonel Holt and all his men were
hallucinating
my position is perfectly clear either of
those explanations is of the utmost
defense interest it has been reported
and claimed and I myself have raised it
with ministers at the defense ministry
in this country who deny that anything
they have been informed is of defense
interest surely to any sensible person
either of those explanations must be
cannot fail to be of defence interest
that the colonel of a an American Air
Force Base in Suffolk and his merry men
are hallucinating
when they&#39;re a nuclear-armed aircraft on
the base must be of defense interest if
indeed what he says took place did take
place and why on earth should he make it
up then surely the entry of a vehicle
from outer space
certainly not man-made to a defense base
in this country also cannot fail to be
of defence interest and it simply isn&#39;t
any good ministers and the Ministry of
Defence in particular saying that
nothing that took place that December
night in Suffolk is of Defense interest
it simply isn&#39;t true since my name has
become connected with UFO matters in
quite a big way in this country and in
one or two other countries too I have
frequently been asked by a person of my
background or former chief of the
Defence Staff a former chairman of the
NATO military committee why I think
there is a cover-up or what the reasons
may be for governments wishing to cover
up the facts about UFOs and a number of
explanations have often been put forward
on which the most frequent and perhaps
the most plausible is that the
government&#39;s concerned which are
primarily that of the United States and
that of my own country believe that if
they told the truth which is that there
are objects in our atmosphere which are
technically miles in advance of anything
that we can deploy that we have no means
of stopping them coming here and that we
have no defense against them should they
be hostile that I believe is because
governments fear that if they did
disclose those infects people would
panic people would rush about Jem
switchboard like they did in that famous
day in New York when there was a spoof
Martians have landed people will go mad
and they&#39;ll jump up and down I don&#39;t
believe that at all I&#39;ve said so in
print I&#39;ve said it in the foreword I
wrote to one of Timothy goods books I do
not believe that people today in the
21st century are going to panic at that
sort of info
after all they have put up with the
introduction of nuclear weapons the
destruction of two Japanese cities 50
years ago they put up not put up with
it&#39;s the wrong word they take as a
matter of course that we can land
vehicles on Mars they land to the
precise instant forecast years before
vehicles on distant planets why should
they panic they&#39;re much more interested
in this country in doing the pool&#39;s or
the lottery they shrug their shoulders
and take it as a matter of course anyway
they don&#39;t trust politicians in my
experience so I believe that that is the
most likely explanation there are of
course others but I think God have to
settle for that what I&#39;d like to say is
that there is a serious possibility that
we are being visited and have been
visited for many years by people from
outer space from other civilizations
that it behooves us in case some of
these people in the future or now should
turn hostile to find out who they are
where they come from and what they want
this should be the subject of rigorous
scientific investigation and not the
subject of rubbishing by tabloid
newspapers
from him
diving on the thing in the whole
aircraft shaky and it just took off in
the space several thousand miles and I
almost directly up now this was at night
reminded me a lot of the shuttle launch
