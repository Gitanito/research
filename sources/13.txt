 Jewish Theosophist, The.
 Devoted to the study of Judaism in the light of Theosophy and Theosophy in the light of Judaism / A Newer Magazine.
 1926-1932  Quarterly (irregular)
 Seattle, WA.  Publisher: Association of Hebrew Theosophists in America.  Editor: Henry C. Samuels (1886-1965).

 1/1, September 1926.  $1.00 a year, 32 pp.  Besides the usual Theosophical articles, largely taken from other Theosophical journals, and a marked enthusiasm for Krishnamurti, the journal and the association that published appear to have been focused on what Judaism could contribute to Theosophy and how Theosophy could enrich Judaism.  "The principal object of the Association of Hebrew Theosophists is to study Judaism in the light of Theosophy and Theosophy in the light of Judaism, and this magazine is devoted to that purpose. . . .  All seekers after truth are Theosophists at heart."  Notable in this project were articles on "The Ancient Kabbalah" ("practically unknown to the Jews of today") and Hassidism (complete with a picture of the Baal Shem Tov), both of which the editor introduces with explanatory detail that reveals his expectation that the topics were utterly foreign to most of his readers.
