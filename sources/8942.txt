  		              		Experience Description   

    I was a water-meter reader for the city. We were at the park to get our route books and return them there when we were finished. A bunch of us were at the supervisor's van turning in our books. He was parked on the other side of the parking lot from where we were parked. One guy had shown up with his car and said, 'Hop on the trunk and hood and I'll take y'all to your car.' About six of us hopped on his car. I sat on the driver's side front-fender. He started off slow and decided to show off and popped the clutch when he shifted to second gear. We were going probably 15 to 20 mph. I felt myself slipping off and decided that I need to push off to avoid getting run over. I made about two steps and fell face first into the blacktop street with the right side of my face hitting first. I remember the steps and falling. 

  The next thing I remember was hovering about 10 feet in the air over my body. I saw my supervisor holding my head in his lap. I heard a ambulance coming into the park and my supervisor screaming for get it to get over here, saying, 'He hasn't been breathing for several minutes!' Then  I remember  being in a place that was foggy, but not foggy. Hard to explain. It had no defined borders or colors. I was in a sense of peace, with no pain, and a feeling of it's o.k. I remember thinking that I wasn't  breathing. Yet, I felt no panic. It felt like nothing I can describe but it was like not breathing was normal. I don't know why I remember this but it seemed important at the time. 

  I started hearing a screeching sound and opened my eyes to see that I  was in a stainless steel box. It was the inside of the ambulance, but I did not realize it at the time. The emergency medical service  (EMT) guy was telling the other EMT that he couln't  stabilize me, so hurry up.

   Then I was back to the ethereal place. I then heard someone say, 'Do we know the next of kin?' I was on a gurney against the wall in the emergency room with a sheet over my head. I sat up and said, 'I can tell you.' A nurse with her back to me screamed and dropped the tray of things, she was carrying,  on the floor. A doctor ran over to me and I answered his questions like who I was, what was my wife and father's phone number. I then passed out and woke up two days later with a fractured skull, a severe concussion, and all the skin on the right side of my face missing.
