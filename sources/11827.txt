I was just a kid, about 8 years old.  I was standing in the bathroom before the mirror and my mom was applying Vicks Vaporub to my chest.  There was a very loud, almost electric-sounding buzzing sound that grew progressively louder.  In the next moment, I was flying at a rapid rate through a tunnel, accompanied by pinpoints of very bright light, which I immediately recognized as angels... lots of angels.  Then, I awoke to my mom slapping my face, shaking me, and screaming for my dad.  In the first instant, I came to awareness, I remember being VERY angry that I was back here.  I wanted to go on.  It was so beautiful, peaceful, and the purest joy I have ever known.  There has never been anything on earth to compare with the feeling.  I was told that I had gone into a convulsion and my heart stopped.  I was probably gone for about two to three minutes.

It was ALL significant to me, as I have an extremely compassionate and loving nature now.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       Yes.  I have spent my whole life since with a distinct sense of purpose and love.  I've had a knowing that I am here for a reason, though it is not clear exactly what that purpose is, other than to do my best to bring love and understanding to others and to perform healing on all levels.  I especially love animals and have had many experiences with wildlife and other animals that are of an unusual nature.    

  Experience Description 3810  I had a severe cold and my mom was 'greasing me up' with Vicks Vaporub.  I began to hear a buzzing sound that grew louder and louder. The next thing I knew, I was going rapidly through a tunnel toward a light.  I saw small, bright orbs of light accompanying me and I said to myself, 'Angels!'  Before I could reach the light, I returned to my body and came to.  My mom was slapping me, crying, and screaming.  I was very angry to find myself back in my body.  I wanted to go on... it was so peaceful and joyful.
