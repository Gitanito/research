"Phrenology being the knowledge of the most .tm·
portant part of man, n.nd showing the relations be-
tween the carebral organization and the manifestation
of mind, cannot be u~eless. It reduces philosophy to
demonstrative principles; furnishes new rules for the
arts of imitation; guides our judgment to social inter-
course; and is the foundation of the doctrines on insa-
nity and education."-Dr. Spurzfteim.
"We fear not ridicule; we heed not the denuncia-
tion ofmaterialism! atheism! and uiher bug-hear terms
used by fools to frighten greater fools. 'Ve care not
what a s~iencc teache~, so it be true; we care not
where it leads, so long as its path is that of truth; in
that path we arc willing to follow unheedingly, though
it terminates in infidelity to all religion; for religion
is true, or it is worthless.''-From the America~a
Monthly.

Philosophers in all ages and in all countries,
have had their dogmas; these they have uniformly
considered the standard for mankind, a.nd in ~up­

the prejudices, and fears of the multitude. That

up, was hurled, if practicable, into the depths of
oblivion.
No science has had to co~tend more strenu-

kind, than Phrenulogy. Its opponents would

THrs volume is offered to the notice of an en·
lightened and reflecting public. -
Its author presents it with the hope that the
reader will address himself to the subject on
which it treats, witt) the spirit of a phil,
osopher;
that he will divest his mind of all prejudice, ofall
preconceived opinions, hasty or party feelings,
founded upon the erroneous statements, misre-
presentations, raiJlery, or abuse of its adversaries.
Let him but calmly and dispassionately enter up-
on its examination, with a sincere desire to dis-
cover truth, and it fears no ordeal. Let him
scrutinize, investigate, analyze, submit to the se-
·verest test every proposJtton advanced; let him
place it, as it were, in the clear, brilliant, uncloud-
ed, meridian rays of the sun, then will he be pre-
pared to receive and appreciate facts in relation
to it as they really exist.
Phrenology is the mirror of human nature; in
it, man sees reflected his animal, moral, and in-
tellectual faculties: by means of it, each individu-
al perceives more clearly, and is enabled correctly
to account for anomalies, the existence of which
he may be conscious in himself or of which
he may be cognizant, in others. It is of lasting

watch-word "onward!" it flings the broad fold of
its banner to the breeze, and on it men behold in-
scribed in characters of gold, "Magna est veritas
et prcevalebit."
Already the wild red warrior of the "West,"
in astonishment, has declared to the Author, when
unfolding to him his peculiar traits of character,
that he had dealings with the Great Spirit.
To believe or dtsbelieve anv science, we must
understand the principles on·which it is based,
and to attain this end \Ve must investigate for our-
selves, and on this investiga.tion will depend our
belief or disbelief. It is impossible to believe that
which we do not understand, and though vve fre-
quently yield a blind credence to a doctrine, still
this is not reasonable or philosophical belief; that
belief which is the result of conviction is worth a
million of th~ other.
Ilow many ofthose who ore daily seen to sneer
and iaugh n.t the doctrines of Gall and Spurzheim,
have ever thought seriously of the matted not
one in a thousand!
The fool's weapon, ridicule, has been hurled,
with vengeance against the science-and like a
huge mass rolling from the loftiest mountain top
-it has swept in its course all those who have
not had force enough of their own, to withstand
its impulse. --

Convinced of the truth of their science, know-
ing the immutability of the basis on which it rests,
and that sophistry, combined with false philosophy,
and all the ingenuity of man, could not sap itsfoun-

opponents. "\Vith the conviction that phrenologv

FUNCTIONS OF THE BRAIN.
MAN has been justly called the "Lord of the
Creation," he- is the most intelligent of afl liv-
ing beings that inhabit this planet, he reduces
all nature to supply his wants and to grati(y
his appetites.
All this arises from his superior mental powers.
But deprive him of this bountiful gift of the Cre-
ator, and we have a being naked, more helpless,
destitute, and miserable in his naturai condition,
than any other animal. Being left without any
natural means of defence, he would have been
devoured by wild animals, or destroyed by the
elements.
But, from his organization, his reasoning facul-
ties were brought into action by necessity, and he
soon more than supplied all his natural deficiencies.
E:rperience having afforded him instruction from
generation to generation, until at last we find him
organized in to societies~ building towns and cities,
skilled in the arts and sciences. There being no
bounds to his power, we find him play·ing with
the clements, turning deserts into gardens, tra-
versing the ocean; making the heavenly bodies
sub~ervient to his purpose, turning the course
of rivers, levelling mountains, in fact the whole
olohc shows the mighty effects of human pow~r!

Are we to be biased in this investigation by the
many reigning speculations and doctrines, or are
'·.; to be guided alone by nature~
"'\Vhen we fearlessly and boldly seek for truth,
we are sure to find her; and though sometimes
she may be hid for a time by artificial me~ns, to
suit selfish purposes, still, when she does burst
forth, her rays are so powerful and brilliant, as to
eclipse all false doctrines. Truth is the language
of the Creator, and all truths emanating from him
must benefit and interest mankind. I then ha\·e
to prove Phrenology to be true, nor will I com-
:promise, in the irn·estigation, one item. to suit the
views of this or that party, and will leave the
science to its own. but sure destin\·, su.ccess.
Philosophers ha~e, from the eo.rli"est dawn of in-
telligence. supposed that the superiority of man,
depended upon some etherial essence, which was
not poss:~ssed by nny other animated being. If
we tr~ce the Zootogicai chain, from the polypus or
microscopic anirnalcula. up to man, do we not find
that gradually as the being becomes more and
more complir.ated in its structure, there is indicat-
ed, in the sume ratio, a greater share of intelli-
gence1 The nen·ous system is rem3.rkably simfle

ascends to quadrupeds, ·when we finJ it approach-

tended intercourse with the external world. Na-
ture hus added the more complex organs accord- .
ing as the relation of the species with the surround-
ing creation haYe become more numerous, it is thus
by the successive additions of new organs, and
the more perfect de\'elopment of others, that the
animal chain is elevated to mun himself.
FUNCTIONS O.lt' THE BRAIN. 13
Would not this, of itself, be very strong evi-
dence of the immediate connection between the
brain and the mind 7for we find other organs in
th_e lower animals cm·responding in perfection
With those of man, also whose functions exactly
accord. Is the function of the eye, ear, heart,
lungs, &c., different in the dog, o.x, monkey, ele-
phant, &c., from that of man? No; we invuriably
find like parts producing like functions in all ani-
mals.
Experience has demonstrated the functions of
the various portions of our body, their mere ana-
tomical structure does not, nor has not, been the
cause of the discovery oftheir uses. The Egyp--
tians were well acquainted with the general ap-
pearance of the brain, and so were all anatomists
with the structure of the heart; and until Harvey
explained and demonstrated its functions, no one
knew it to be the seat of circulation: again, until
Spurzheim and Sir C. Bell proved that a nerve,
simple in its appearance, could perform two dis-
tinct functions, all nerves were supposed to be
alike. Such is the consequence, when we rashly
infer that because an organ presents uniformity
of structure, of necessity its functions should
also correspond. Directly we abandon the path
of experience and resort to this a priori mode of
reasoning,we meet ·with perplexities, and are led
into a labyrinth of difficulties. The same kind of
reasoning which will prove the eye to be the or-
gan of sight, the stomach to be the seat of diges-
tion,and the heart ofcirculation,will prove the hraiu
to be the seat of the mind. {Has the mind ever
been known to exist except in connection with

the various parts in accordance w ith their sup·
posed resemblances; this seems to have been the
amount of knowledge possessed in regard to this
important organ, pnor to Drs. Gall and Spurzhe~m,
who have immortalized their names by making
kncwn not onlv its anatomical structure but its
fun ctions. "
'rhe brain is the most delicate and beautifl.llly
constructed oi all other organs of the body ; and
if we may judge of the importance of an organ by
the care and. protection which nature has taken
to shield it from injury, no organ ii of such im·
portance as the brain. From its structure the
blightest pressure would have altered its shape
nnd derun~ed its action; hence it is powerfully
guarded by several strong envelopes, the most
solid of which is its spherical, resisting, bony case,
in which it is contained. 'Vithin this bony case we
find three membranes, so placed as to prevent
concussions acting on its substance; externally,is
the scalp ou which is the abundant growth ofhairj
then, in its immediate neighborhood, are the five
extern~ senses, acting as so many sentinels to
warn and protect it from all casualties.
( In the human being the brain receives more
Lhan one-fifth of the whole volwne of blood which
is propelled from the heart: if it was of such little
importance a.s some would make us helie\-·e, l1ow
{ is it that such a portion of this valuable fluid
should be sent to it?
Again, its commanding, elevnted situation, &c.,

guo.ge, to the dwelling place of the emporium of

(may have lost his ]jmbs, and still his mind remain's
perfect. The heart by many is supposed to be
the seat of our passions, feelings, &c.; this organ
frequently becomes ossified, atrophied, hypertro·
phied, inflamed or affecting in a variety of forms,
without affecting the mind (except when the dis-
ease affects the system generally). 'Vhy then
should we aseribe to the heart any qualities of
{
mind? the heart of many of tne lower animals is
equally perfect with that of man, yet they do not
possess mind in common with him. Its office is
confined to the circulation of the blood, and a
very important one it is, without taxing on it arty _./
other function.
The diaphragm, ft thin, tendinous muscle, which
divides the ahdomen from the thorax, was again
by many ascribed os the location of the soul.
Van Helmont ~upposed the stomach to be the
seat of thought, jodgment, &c. Pinel thought
that a small ~andy glnrrd, situated in .the brain, was
the organ of the ~ul. In fitct, there is hardly a por-
tion ofthe body but what has been supposed, atone
period or another, to be the seat of thought and
mtelligence.
The brain was considered by Hipocrates to be
a sponge, which imbibed the moisture of the body.
Aristotle thought it a humid mass, intended to
temper the body, that is, when it was too hot, it
would throw out a fluid, to render it cold. Bichat,
thought it was merely an envelope to the more im-
portant parts within; in ~hort the offices a~cribed
to it, have been as numerous, as they have been ri-
diculous.
The ancient Egyptians were also ignornnt of
its real structure, and the moderns were content-
ed with cutting and slicing it, and giving name'S to

record; and ·when that organ is affected in any
tnanncr, we have a correspond~ng.e~ect produce-d
on the mind. When the bram IS mflamed we
have the ravings and delirium of the madman;
when it is compressed by a fracture of the .skull,
we find coma, insensibility and a suppression of
the mental manifestations; and when the surgeon
elevates the compressincr portion of bone, we see
the mind gradually resu~ing its po,vers. Is not
the mind modified in c-.·cry degree according to
climate, childhood, puberty, manhood, old age,
and decrepitude, &c7 Docs it act independently
in drunkennes~, inflammation, ulcers, e'fusions or
in a great many other atlcctions of the brain1
E\·ery body will acknowledge that these eircum-
stances modify, alter~ interrupt, arrest. elevate or
totally suppress. or change in a thousand ways, the
state of the mind.
The brain in the child is soft and yielding, and
by degrees attains soJidity, until mature age, when

quantity, we find the same beings filling the world
with amazement, some in the capacity of a Gali-
leo, a Kepler, a Newton, a Shakspeare, a Napo-
leon, or a \Vashington.
1'he reason why the physiology of the brain
remained so long a n ystery may be explained
from the fact, that dot...nnes sanctioned by length
of years, seemed sacred, and were revered from
generation to generation through successive •en-
turies, no one daring to burst through the existing
state of things. l\Iysteries of one age become the
subject ofscientific investigation, and are explain-
ed on philosophical principles in the next.
In proportion as any part of the body is used,
in the same ratio will it increase; there is no ex-
ception to this law. The capacit\· of the lungs
is much greater among those ch{sses, who are
employed the greater portion of their lives in ac-
tive, athletic exercises, as is observed in the broad
expansi\·e chest of the sailor, and the arm of the
blacksmith or shipwright, contrasted with the
comp::t.ratively emaciated muscles of the watch-
maker or penman. The hands of those who never
resort to manual operations, are much smaller
than those of the laborer; and the heads or brains
of the relined orders of society are much larger
than among the uneducated classes; this Iatter cir·
cumstance will be corroborated by every hatter
in the country. The rcfore, though our original
configuration of the bra;n Le bad, we may by a
proper course of traiuing in moral and physical
education, be enabled to change (>ntirely the shape
of the head, by the ti!ne the b•mg arrives at ma-
turity. Nor is the remedy t1 c;top here, for per-

sons of from 2;) to 40 yc:1.rs of age have, by sub-
duing their vicious tendencies, or uy applying the
mind to any particular stl;dy, either increased or
dimin:sLed the particular portion of the brain used
or disused.
It will be argued, that it is impossible to change
the formation of the hard and apparently unyield-
ing skull, and such a conclusion would apriori
nppear very rational; but the question is: Is this
the case? The brain is perfectly organized in the
child, even before a ·vestige of bone has been de-
posited on its surface; and the ossification is not
completed until puberty; and from this time to
the Jast moment of the being's existence, this bony
system is continual1y undergoing absorption and
redeposit. Is it reasonable to suppose that the
skull, which is evidently constructed and placed
so as to protect the noblest ofour organs, should
be an impediment to its growth? There is not a
single instance in the whole catalogue of animated
beings, ·where the soft parts are interfered with
in consequence of their hard coverings. Does
not the light of an:>..1ogy give the denial, in as
strong terms as is possible to be used. Look at
the oyster; ·when young it has a firm hard shell,
and, as the animal increases in size, its protection
or shell accommodates itselt: The same is ob-
served in the ca~e of the turtle, the lobster, the
tortoise. the snail. the limpet, and an immense va-
l·iety of the crustaceous tribes.
In fact we have no occasion to resort to proof
beyo~d ourselves. The head increase& materially
from mfrmcy to manhood. In chronic afiections
of the brain, sometimes the skull and brain hnxe
been redur.ed to half their natural size.
_ The org:m of Ant:tti\'enes~: (CerebPIInm.) which
FUNCTIONS OF THE BRAIN. 19
bears a proporti()!'l to the rest of the brain, in the
child is as one to tvurteen, whereas, in the adult,
it is in the ratio of one to five or six. In this par-
ticular region b._
, .\·ever, every one must acknow-
ledge an increase of skull, but, in consequence of
the gradual increase of these parts, it eludes de-
tection by our senses.
Tlte human skull again is known to increase to
an enormous extent in the disease called Hydro-
cephalus or water in the head; which was consi-
dered by the ancients to be nn absorption of the
brain; this of necessity would dcst•·oy the funda-
mcn tal position on ·which phrenolo~y is ba:;ed.
Drs. Gall and ~purzheim have again done service
to the "'·orld by exploding this doctrine; by show-
ing that the brain existed in all its part~, but was
unfolded and occupied a gl'eater surf~l.cc than in
the healthy state; they also demon:)trated its
fibrous structure. The skull, in the;;e ca.;cs, some-
time~ attains the size of 30 to 50 inches in cir-
cumference. I saw a case in 1831 at Bartholo-
mew's Hospital, London, of a child whose head
measureJ -ti inches; and many others varying
from 30 to 40, all of which confirm the above
statement.
The skull is sometimes increased to three or
four times its natura) thickness; but this never
takes place, except when the brain is affected by
disease, and a~ain, in other affections, the skull is
so thin, that tile )east pressure on its surface will
interfere with the manifestations of mind. Do
not then ,"eader,he led astray by those who obtain
such exceptions, and palm them off on the unin-
structed as natural.
The skull is acknowledged by the most eminent
anatomists of the age, to be ~tn exact counterpart of
20 FtJNCTJONS OJ' THI: BRAlN•
the brain. It is composed of two tables or pl~tes
of bone; the one external, being flexible and yteld-
ing; the inner, on the contrary, is brittle and
denser in its texture.
In youth these tables are in close apposition
thro11ghout, and in immediate connection with the
mc, nl~ranes which cover the brain.
\Vhcn any or<ran or set of organs, cease to be
acti,·ely cxercis~d, we find, as the result, that
their actual bulk is much diminished. And when,
as is sometimes the case, the decrease is very
sudden, the internal table fo1lows the brain, leav-
ing the external. The organ of Individuality i3
situated immediately between the eyes, over the
root or the nose (the location of the fi·ontal sinus,
when it exist~), tLe function of this faculty is, to
observe and see every thing within the sphere vf
vi ion; therefor\! it is found generally large in
children, who notice every trh·ial object and
pas-ing occurrence, without reference to their

flus explams the cause of the existence of the
frontal sinus, which has been used as one of the
most powerful weapons against the science· I now
show that it is one of the strongest proofs' in its
favor. And when it does exist, we have an in\·a-
riable beacon to indicate the same, namely,a sud-
den elevation of the supetciliary rido-es, which
any expert phrenologist can detect at ~nee. But,
conceive it, in its most unfavorable light, the only
condusion that we can come to, is, that those or-
gans in its neighborhood cannot be ascertained, and
we gi\·e the reason why, it does not therPfor in
the least degree invalidate the·truth of the science,
the craniology of the p:ut is alone affected, with-
out interfering with its phrenology.
1\Ian has much the largest skull in p1·oportion
to the size of his f~tce, when compared with all
other animals.
The ditference between the face and the skull,
was supposed by many philosophers to be the
meao:;ure of the human understanding over that of
the lower anim:tl~; the ferocity and stupidity of
the latter, being supposed to be greater as the
face and snout surpassed the cranium.
\Vith this i:n prcc:;sion, Camper adopted the fa-
cial angle, whic!1 is known by drawing a line from
the root of the nuse to the opening of the ear,
and another to the most prominent portion ofthe
forehead; the angle of the Horse 25 degrees, Dog
40 dc(rrees, t)apajou G5 degrees, Ourang-outang
67 degrees, and in the human subject, from G5 to
85 derrrees.
Th~ ancients were well acquainted with the
fact, that certain configurations of head inYaria·

it that the head of Nero, made in marble by the
Romans, corresponds exactly phrenologically with
his chara<'.ter? in fact no phrenologist could model
a head to depict the traits of the tyrant more for-
cibly than they are found in the statue; the low,
reccdinN forehead, showing a total want of the
organ of Benevolence, and the Yery smali deve-
lopementofthe moral and intellectual faculties,with
the immcn~c 111ass of brain in the animal region.
Contrast this hentl with that of ~cneca. nnd how dif-

t
It is admitted by all physiologists and philoso-
phers, that the brain is the organ of the mind;
the instrument by which alJ the phenomena of
intellect, sensation, memory, thought or judger
ment are produced. It is clear that when the
instrument used differs, the result \\'ill be differ-
ent; you cannot produce the same phenomena
from a bell, as from a dnun; then when the effect
is ditferent we find a ditierence in the structure
of the instrument used; ·when we hear the sound
of a flute, we know it toLe frotn a flute, when we
hear the sound of a drum. ·we know it to be from
a drum, &c. If all instruments could produce the
same results, we should ha,·e no occasion for a dif..
ference of instruments; and if all brains could pro-
duce the same result~ we should have no occasion
for a ditference of brains to produce different men-
tal manifestations, the brain ofan idiot, ·would be
of the same Yalue as that of a Bacon, or a Frank-
lin. The brain of eYery animal from the worm up
to man, is an exact counterpart ofhis intellect, and
sphere of action, with the external world. The
nervous system in reptiles nnd fishes is simple; in

stve; he3:d. not gene~ally very Ja:gc, but there is
great acttvtty of bram. Pers->i.B of this constitu-
tion are very irritable, sensitive to outward im-
pressions, always on the alert; th~ pulse is small
and quick; such was the temperament of Vol-
taire, Frederick the Great, Sterne, Jefferson,
Montesquieu, &c. &c.
BILIOUS,
The brain firm and dense, hair dark, skin swar-
thy, flesh firm, muscles well defined, body well
proportioned, chest wide, abdomen rather small,
the face dark and expressive, nose aquiline or
Roman, mouth curved, chiu square, pulse strong;
it is among individuals ofthis ternperament that we
find those who, in different ages, have governed
the destinies of the world-Brutus, Julius Cresar,
Alexander the Great, Mahomet, Peter the Great,
Cromwell, Napoleon, Wellington, &c. &c.
The temperaments are seldom if ever found
pure, for we find nervous and sanguine; lympha-
tic and sanguine; bilious and nervous; lymphatic
and bilious, &c. as the most common combinations.
T.IUIP.ERAKENT.
LYMPHATIC,
The worst constitution of the body, the whole sys-
tem being weak, with a great abundance of fat and
cellular tissue; the muscles are soft and not well
define..l; circulation is slow and sluggish; the eyes
want expression; the hair is usually light, and the
skin pule white. Examples, Daniel Lambert, &c.
In dissecting persons of this te111perament, I have
observed the correspondence in the tedut'e of the
brain; it being soft and watery, indicating want
of power during existence.
SANGUINE,
Is known by the general plumpness of the muscles;
the skin being clear, the hair of a light color, the
eyes L!ue,gray and haz~l. the complexion flo~·id,
pulse sh~rp, fretlttent and regnl~r, anrl sovn cxci~­
ed, a general t::.ttdency to corpulency and has :m
animated coun ten:\nc~. The par~on who posst>ss:>s
this constitution, with a head of the sa·ne size as one
of the NetTous or Bilious, wjll not ha\·e such pow-
er of mind; will require much more application to
proJuce the same effect, and wiH not be so bold
m his projects.
This temperament is frequently mixed with the
nen·ous~ and forms one of the best constitu-
tions, such as that possessed by Fox, Pitt, Burke,
Clay, &c.
NERVOUS,
Is characterized by the features being strongly
marked, the muscles small and emaciated, fine
thin h~ir, eye not large, but sp:1rkling and expres-
TEMPERAMENT. 23
powerful as !l large one, bearing in mind that the
structure is the same, nor is it more irrational to
suppose that a sm1.ll brain is of the same value as
one of double its size, than to ascrib0 the same
power to all brains.
TEMPERAMENT.
The temperament indicating the general consti-
tution, texture or quality of the whole system, and
the brain being a very important portion of that
system, does not escape participating. This is not
a matter ofspeculation for I have particularly inves-
tigated this subject, when in the large hospitals of
London and Paris, where abundant opportunities
presented themselves to observe the correspond·
ence between the texture ofthe brain and that ofthe
body,and I invariably found,that when the subject
was gross, corpulent, and possessed a g1·eat super-
abundance of cellular and adipose tissue, that tht-
brains ofsuch individuals presented,when observed
with'¥ollaston's reflecting microscope, coarsenes~
offibre,watery,and ageneral want of consistence.
This appearance is l::1own as the Lymphatic tem-
perament; there are three others, namely; the San-
guine, Nervous and Bilious,each being the criterion
ofa corresponding quality of brain. This is one of
the most important consideration~ in disco\'ering
the power of the mind, for the size ofthe bmin is not
alone indicative of power or excellence: two he3.d~
ofthe same size and configuration, the one having
the best temperament, will certainly manifest
much greater power anfi enE'rgy.

Un.con, Smith, Reid, Ultgald Stewart, Locke,

it requires the whole mind or brain to produce
any etlect. !lave we not distinct organs for
smelling, hearing, see~ng, &c., all of which they
allow to be mental opE"rations. Yet, that fear,
love, hatred, music, painting, mathematics, poe-
try, odoration~ mechanic~, &c. should ernanate
pell-mell from one organ, is repugnant to reason,
and forms an exception to every other portion of
the system.
If the brain was an unit, all men would have
talents alike, the- only ditl<.

no such thing as a genius in one department of
mind could exist. Yet we find Homer a poet,
Ca~sar a warrior, Lycnrgns a legislator, Archimi-

rive at that advancecl point where the brain from
th~ simple organ of Amativeness gradually re-
ceives additions, "each addition being marked
by some addition or amplification of the pow-
ers of the animal, until in man we behold it
possessing some part of which animals are des-
titute, nnd wanting some which they possess,
so that we are enabled to associate every faculty
which gives superiority, with some addition to the
nervous mass, even from the smallest indications
of sensation and will, up to the highest degree of
sensibility, judgment and expression."
In no instance do we find a simple brain, where
the faculties of the animnl are numerous, and
complicated, nor do we fincl a highly organized
brain where the functions of the animal are sim-
ple; and those parts of the brain which exist are
exactly adapted to their sphere of action, man
having those additions which give him reason and
inte1ligence. Therefore the brain of every ani-
mal is perfect in itself, the mind of a dog, a
horse, an elephant, or an ourang-outang is in an
exact ratio with the degree ofdevelopement oftheir
cerebral mass, and whenever we find an animal,
or a man, deficient in a particular organ of tbe
brain, invariably the faculty of mind correspond-
ing is also "\Vanting. It is as reasonable to sup-
pose any action of mmd being brought into ope-
ration without its app1·opriate organ, as to suppose
sight ·without an eye, or hearing without an ear.
Thus if the animal has no organ in the brain ap-
propriated to destructiveness, it cannot destroy.

HISTORY OF DR. GALL• .J.
IDSTORY OF DR. GAIAT..
Francois Joseph Gall, was born in a viJlage of
the grand Duchy of Baden, on the 9th of March,
1758. He was the sixth child. His father was
a merchant and the ::Mayor of Teifenbrnn, a vil-
lage two leagues distant from Pforzheim, in Swa-
bia. His parents profes~ed the Roman Catholic
religion, and had intended him for the Church;
but his natural disposition was opposed to it. He
afterwards pursued the i\Iedical profession, and
graduated in Vienna.
Dr. Gall gives an account, of which the follow-
ing is an abstract, of the manner in which he was
led to the study of the natnral talents and disposi-
tion of man, his views of which terminated in the
formation of the Pllrenologicttl system.
From an early age he was given to observation,
and was struck with the fact that each of his
brothers and sisters, companions in play, and
school-fellows~ possessed some peculiarity of tal-
ents or disposition which distinguished him from
all the others.
Some of his sr.hool-mates were distinguished by
the beauty of their penmanship, some by their
success in arithmetic, and others by their talents
fo1 acquiring a knowledge of natural history, or
of languages.
The composition of one was remarkable for
elegance, while that of another was stiff and dry:
and a. third connected his reasoning in a closer
young; and iu th : . we find the organ ofPhilopro-
gcn_iti\'Cness \\antiug. The bear and monkey love
thear young, and ··;e lind Philoprogenitivcness very
large. The uPa. ~r builds, ·we find Constructive-
ness very large. The nightingale, thrush: aud ca-
nary sing, and in them we find the organ of Tune.
The ourang-outang is sagacious, and we find au
extra quantity of brain iu the front region, which
raises him aboYe his brother monkies. The know-
ing elephant also shows his peculiar clmraeteris-
tics in the de\·clopement of brain, &c. The same
law holds in every living creatnre with \\ hieh man
has become acquaintc•l.
All the preceding ttrgurnen ts arc opposed to the
theories of the l\Ietaphysiciaus,who ascribP to the
mind general qualiti~s, such as perception, judg-
lllent, reflection, imagination, will &c., we might
as well pretend to dl'!"Cribc the qnalitic~ of iron or
golJ, &c., by l"itnply S<.tyin::!; that they possess
weight, culur, or other general qualities which
arc possessed by most substan:..:es.
Philosophers generally have described the ani-
ma], moral und intellectual nature of man !,y the
standard of thci r particular teelings. This state
of things has existed for upwards of twenty fi1
:e
hundre<l years; lmt as a grund era in the advance-
ment of medical s<;ieriee has l1
een datetl from Har-
vey's dis~o\·ery of the circulati'JU uf the blood, so
will an era even more glorious because fraught
with more usefulness and happiness; an era. in
l\Icntal sci~nce, involving the \·ery springs of hu-
man couduct, be dated from the existence of GaJI.

child. ~:;:.iie others again are brought Mtu activity
at p~berty. The organ of Amativeness ~n the
child, bears a proportion to the other portton of
the brain, as 1 to 12 or 14; and in the adults as
1 to 6 or 8.
The perceptive, or knowing faculties, are very
large in the child, whereas the reflective or reason-
ing ones are only brought into operation at ma-
ture age. If the brain were a simple organ this
could not take place.
Women possess certain faculties of the mind,
much more powerful than men; while we find men
again taking the ascendency in other particulars.
We even find children in one family varying in
their characters as widely as can possibly be con-
ceived; and I have found in the examination of
some thousands, that there is a corresponding de.
velopement of brain.
Those who apply themselves to one study, as
Monks, Priests, Ecclesiastics,Artists, Poets, Musi-
cians, are generally much more subject to mania,
and it is among these classes of men that we find
fanatics and enthusiasts; while we find those
who apply the mind to a diversity of subjects, as
Naturalists, Philosophers, Chemists, Geographers,
&.c., seldom affiicted ·with this disease.
'J'he lower animals again furnish another proof
qf ~he plurality of the mind. The fox is cun·
ning and sly; and in them we find the organs of
Secretiveaess and Caution. •
t- ·l'he cat, tiger, panther, &c., are treacherous and
co·wardly; and there we find Combath·eness and
Adhesi\•eness smaU, anrl Caution, Destructi,~eness
and Secretiveness large. In the dog, faithful and
courageous, we find Cor~~ bativeness and Adhesive·
nes~ lnrg~. Ostriches and cn._:~oos ne,·er see their
described called Somnambulism, which is a stat&
of incomplete sleep.
When some of our intellectual organs and one
of our senses are awake, we may be aware of the .
irrationality of our dream during that state.
When some of our mental organs are asleep
with two or more senses awake, then we can at-
tend to external impressions, and notice the gradu-
al departure of our slumbers.
\Vhen we are quite awake, and are so occupied
by mental operations, that we can divest ourselves
from all external objects,we have a revery which
de-ludes us like a dream. Is it not evident, that if
the brain were a simple organ and performed its
fuction as a unit, no such thing as dreaming could
take place? one part could not be in the waking
or active state while another remained in the pas-
sive or sleeping state; it must be altogether sleep-
ing or waking. ~
Every body is acquainted with the fact, that a
person may have be<.;ome fatigued in consequence
of applying his mind to one pursuit, and by chang·
ing the direction of his mind to one of some other
nature, no lassitude is experienced; for instance,
the mechanic or the merchant, after the toils of
the day, may apply himself without any effort to
any department of the fine arts, music, reading.
or other entertainments.
How is this analyzed, on the supposition that
the mind is an unit? In this case, every faculty
must be relaxed at the same time-no such thing
as partial fatigue cnn take placs.
The organs are not all brought into operation
at the same age; some remain dormant until rna•
ture age, others are vigorous and active in tho

~anner, and clothed his argument in the most for-
Cible langua~e. Their dispositions were differ-
e~t, and the1r diversity appeared also to deter-
n:tme the direction of their partialities and aver-
swns. Not a few of them manifested a capacity
for employments which they were not taught;
some cut figures on wood, to delineate them on
paper; some devoted their leisure to painting or
the culture of a garden, while others abandoned
themselves to noisy games, or traversed the woods
to gather flowers, seek for birds nests, or catch
butterflies. In this manner, each individual pre-
sented a character peculiar to himself, and Gall
never observed that the individual who in one
year had displayed a selfish or knavish disposition,
became in..the next, either good or faithful.
The scholars with whom young Gall had the
greatest difficulty in competing, were those who
learned by heart with great facility, and such in-
dividuals frequently gained from him by their re-
petitions, the places which he had gained by his
original compositions.
Some years afterwards, having changed his
place of residence, he still met individuals having
a great talent of learning to repeat. He then ob-
served that his school·fellows so gifted had pro-
minent eyes; and he recollected that his rivals in
the first -school had been distinguished by the
same peculiarity.
When he entered the University, h~ directed
his attention, from the first, to the students whose
eyes were of this description, and he soon found
that they all excelled in getting rapidly by heart,
and giving correct recitations, although many of
them were by no means distinguished in point of
general talent. He soon came to the conclusion,
46
llSTORY OF DR. GALL• - '
that it could not be the effect of chance, and af..
ter reflecting maturely upon it, he came to the
determination, that if memory was always accom.
panied by large, prominent eyes, our other facul·
ties must be connected with other external con·
formations. '• From this moment," says he, "eve.
ry indi\·idual distinguished for any peculiar quality
or propensity, became the object of my attention,
and of a close study of their heJ.ds." Great poets,
great 1\Iusicians, great .i\Iathematicians, great
Painters, great Artists, great \Varriors, great ora·
tors, &c. all became the object of his investiga-
tion, and he a.lways found a pJ.rticula.r part of
their head very much developed. ln making these
observations, he ne,·er concei\·ed for a moment,
that the skull \Vas the cause of the different ta-
lents, as has been erroneous! y repre::;ented by his
enemies; he referrt-d the influence, whatever it
was, to the brain. Dr. Gall had observed in the
writinris of the .:\Ietaphysicians, the variety and
discordance of opinions reb.ti,·e to the brain. He
observed that Philosophers and Physiologists as·
serted, that ull men are born with equal mental
fucul ties; and that the ditlerences observable
among thern. are owing either to education, or to
the accidental circumstances in which thev are
placed. ·
If all differences are accidental. he inferred that
there could be no natural signs of predominating
faculties, and consequently, that the project of
learning by observation. to distingnish the func-
tions of the ditreren t portions of the brain, must
be hopeless. This difficulty he soon oyercame,
by the reflection, that his brothers, sisters and
school-fellows had all recei,·ed the same educa-
ti0n= hut that he had ~till ob.;;en·ed E-ach of them
47
unfolding a distinct character, over which cir-
cumstances appeared to exert only a limited con-
trol.
He observed that frequently those, on whom the
greatest care had been bestowed in edueation, re-
mained far behind others. "Often," says Dr. Gall,
"we were accused of want ofwill, or deficiency in
zeal; but many of us could not, even 'vith the
most ardent desire, followed out by the most ob-
stinate efforts, attain, in some pursuits, even to
mediocrity; while, in some other points, some of
us surpassed others without an etrort, and almost,
it might be sai<l, without perceiving it ourselves.
But, m point of fact, our m1.sters did not attach
much faith to the system which taught the equali·
ty of mental faculties; for they thought themselve3
entitled to exact more from one scholar, and less
from another. They spoke frequently of natural
gifts of God, and consoled their pupils in the
words of the Gospel, by assuring them that each
woulQ. be required to render an account only in
proportion to the g!fts \vhieh he had received.";lf.
· Being convineed of thes~ filets, that there is a
natural and constitutional diversity of talents and
dispositions, he encountereJ in books, still another
obstacle to his success in determining the external
signs of the mental powers. He found that, in·
stead of faculties for languages, drawing, music,
mechanics, remembering places, corresponding to
the different talents which he had obspn·ed in his
different schoolmates, the metaphysicians spoke
only of general powers, such as perception, me·
mory, imagination, and judgment; and when he
endeavored to find external signs on the head for
-----------------------------
• freface by Dr. n:\11, to lhe "Attrttomil", &~. n I Cer\'et\U."
48
these generalities, he found perplexities without
end, and difficulties insurmountable.
Dr. Gall, therefore, determined to observe na·
ture, and abandon all kinds of speculation founded
on the preconceive(.} opinions of others.
Bein(l' Physician of the Lunatic Asylum in Vi-
enna, h~ had opportunities of observation, ofwhich
he availed himself, on the insane. He visited pri-
sons, and resorted to schools; he was introduced
to the Courts of Princes, to Colleges, and Courts
of Justice; and whenever he heard of an individ-
ual distinguished in any particular way, either by
anv remarkable endowment or deficiencv, he ob-
se;ved and studied the developement of his head.
In this manner, by an almost imperceptible in-
duction, he concei,·ed him~elf w·.uranted in be-
li~'ling that particular mental powers are indicat·
ed by particular shapes of head.
Hitherto he had resorted only to Physiological
indications, as a means of disc~wering the func-
tions of the brain.
On reflection, howe,·er. he \Y,B convinced that
Physiology was imperfect when separated from
Anatomy. Having observed a woman of fifty·
four yt'ars of age, who had been afflicted with
Hydrocephalus from her youth, and who with a
body a little shnmk, posse~::sed a mind as acth·e
and intelligent as that of other persons of her
dass. Dr. Gall declared his conviction. that the
structure of the brain in these cases must be dif·
fcrent from that generally recei,·ed; a remark
which Tulpius also had made, on observing a Hv·
drocephalic patient, who manifested the mental
faculties.
He, therefore. felt the necessit\· of makina ana·
tomical researches into the structure of thebrain.
)tJsTORi 0~ DR. GALL.O 49
ln every instance, when an individual, whose
h~ad he harl observed while alive, happened to
d1e, he used every means to be permitted to ex·
amine the brain, and ti·equerttly did so; and he
tound, ns n general fact, that on removal of the
skull, the brnin, covered by the duramater, pre·
sented a form corresponding to that which the
skull had exhibited in life.
The successive steps by which Dr. GalJ pro·
ceeded in his discoveries, are particularly deserv·
ing of attention.
He did not, as many suppose, first dissect the
brain and pretend by that means to have disco·
,·ered the scats of the mental powers; neither did
he~ as others have conceived, first map out the
~kull into various compartments, and assign a fa.
cuity to each, according as his imagination led
him to conceive the place approprir~ted to the
power. On the contrary, he first observed a con·
cornitancc betwixt particular talents and disposi-
tions, and particular forms of the head; he next
ascertained, by removal of the skull, that the figure
and size of the brain are indicated by these external
forms; and it wns only after these fa~ts were de-
termined, that the brain was minutely dissected~
and important light thrown on its structure.
From this time Dr. GaJI commenced lecturing
in public, and was shortly after joined by Dr.
Spurzheim, who was born on the 31st of Decem·
her, 1776, at Longvick, a village about seven
miles from the city of Treves, on the Moselle, in
the lower circle of the Rhine; after the year 1804,
these great men continued their Jn.bors conioint-
ly, travelling to different places, visiting hospitals,
prisons, and all places where persons were col·

lected in numbers. Dr. Gall died in Paris, 22d
August, 1828, in the seventy-second year of his
age; after having brought comparatively to a
state of perfection, a science, whose results \Viii
be of more importance to mankind than any other
that has adorned the path of civilized man. Dr.
Spurzheim, having travelled throu~h the greater
part of Europe, visited the United ~fates of Arne·

nacle of greatness, if they have the materials to
work with; and again, we find that if u man have
not this original structure, though he may be
placed in a l=l!tuation to improve, to a great extent,
still he cannot be what he originally was not; an
idiot can never become a Newton or Shakspeare.
Education therefore makes men, only so tar as
their organization will admit. The reader is refer-
ed particularly to the following considerations.
TEST OF THE ORGANS.
Every organ or faculty is established that comes
under the following rules:
l. Which exists in one kind of anirnals and not
in another•
. 2. Which varies in the sexes of the same spe-
Cie~.
3. Which is not proportionate· to the other fa-
culties of the individual. '
4. Which is not manifested simultaneously with
the r ther faculties; that is, which appears or dis-
appears singly, at earlier or later periods of life.
5. Which may act or rest singly.
6. Which may preserve of itselfits proper state
of health and disease.
FUNDAMENTAL POSITIONS .
•
Phrenology is based on the folJowing premises:
lst. That the brain is the material organ of the
mind.
2d. That the brain is composed of a number of
parts, each having a special function to perform.
5~
54 EXAlliNATION OF THE HEAD•
~J. That the bnin differs in shape, size and
constitution in different inJividuals.
4th. Toat the shape of the skull exactly cor-
responds to that of the brain; therefore, the shape
of t:1e brain may be known by inspecting the
skull.
5th. That the quality or constitution of the
hrain, may be ascertained by the temperament.
<3th. The larger the brain (the temperament be-
ing the same,) the greater its power.
7th. The larger an organ. the more disposed it
is to activity. and vice Yersa,-the more active an
organ, the more '\Viii it increase in size.
8th. The observation of 'Jlen in different situa-
tions. as criminals and others, with particular traits
and talents, national differences. and the con-
formation of the head of varir•us c:pecies of ani-
male::.
9th. Pathological observations of persons suf:.
fering from am~ctions oi the brain, ns of cretins,
idiots, insane. monomaniacs-of persons 'vhose
brains h:1.Ye been injured hy extern3.1 Yiolence or
other ca.usec:;-experiments with animals by emi-
nent physiologist~, as l\Iagendie, Vimont, G:tll,
Elliotson, Combe, &c., all tend to demonstrate
the truth of Phrenology.
E X A l\1 I N A T I 0 N 0 F T H E H E A D .
I have found that the surest method of examin-
ing a head, is first to observe the relati\'e propor-
tion, that the regions bear one to the other-next
ascertain the temperament. then with the palm of
the hand and the fingers. the part or parts should
be inspected,. (not with the idE-a of finding protu-
berances. or what are vnlg:wly called bumps,) but
E:XAUINATlON OF THE HEAT>. 55
the particular oonfigura.tion of the head. Great
care and circumspection, should be observed in
combining the various developements before even
an opinion should be given.
DIFFICULTY ATTENDING THE EXAMI•
NATION OF SOME OF THE ORGANS.
The organ of Amativeness is frequently mistaken
by the uninitiated, in consequence of the muscles
of the neck being very large; or again, when the
person is of the nervous Temperament, the parts
may present a smaller appearance than is really
the case.
The same caution should be observed in refe·
renee to Alimentiveness.
Constructiveness, again, is liable to be mista-
l{en in size for the temporal muscle; being large,
will give in the part an unusual enlargement.
Therefore, when being examined, should always
be desired to move the ]ower jaw, that the mus-
de may be put into motion, then its size will soon
be known.
In consequence of a large frontal sinus, the or-
gans of Individuality, Form, Size, and Locality,
may be mistaken, though a skilful Phrenologist
will detect in one moment the existence of this
cavity. The organs of Calculation and Order are
very aifficult to discover, except when they are
very large orsmall. The organ ofLanguage is situ-
ated immeJiately above the supra-orbital plates;
and when this organ is large, it causes this plate
to be depressed; therefore, we have a much smal-
ler cavity for the eye, which causec:: it to pro-
trude. The Phrenologist is frequently deceived
in this particular, if he does not observe the tem..

perament; those of the lymphatic having pro-
minent eyes are notalways linguists, ~ecause the
protrusion is caused by adepose ttssue. But
whenever we find a. prominent and ~ull eye in a
nervous or bilious person, depend on 1t, he has the
capacity to acquire languages.. . ..
Experience in all these parttculars 1s reqmstte;
and all those cmomencing the scienct-, should
give their opinions in regard to these with gn•at
care.
The brain is, literally speaking, a double organ;
that is, there are t\.\'Odistinct brains; eal!h hemi-
sphere being complete in itself, the same parts
being contained on each side; the hemispheres
present as nenr nn approach to each other, as the
eye does to its fellow. Therefore, when Phre-
~ologists speak of any faculty of the mind, they
mclude the organ of both hemispheres, for they
act in concert. the same as the two eyes produce
but one impression of the object seen on the mind.

vr.r~e to thn nl"rl't of his atlection; and "·hen
60
combined w ith large Firmness and Adhesiveness,
he will be constant in his ail~ctions; but with
Adhesiveness f.lmall, he will flirt with many; and
if Conscientiousness be a]~o small, with lat·ge 8e-
.-;retivene~s, he will cause each to belie\'e that he
is ~10nest in l1is intentions, and yP-t intend to de-
cen·e.
One with A.mati,:eness and Acquisitiveness both
large, and Benevolence small, will marry tor the
arrke of obtaining money; but with Ideality and
.Adhe~i\'encgs large, will marry for the beauty and
charms of his wife. One with th2 mora] faculties
also large, wil1 enioy the fami1 y circle; this feel·
ing will be a~ain increa.::.ed, if Prlilopro;eniti,~en ess
is large. The saU1e, having Destructiveness and
Col!1bati,·cness brge, ·will defend his family, and
e\·en puni.;;h tho~c~ whom he conceives to be their
enemies, with extreme se\rerin·.
One ha\ing Appr~.lbati,·eness and Self-Esteem
large will be very desirou3 of obtaining the favor
of the other sex. an1i will follow their ad\~ice on
e\·ery subje·"t: the~e kind of men are apt to be
ruled hy thei~· \Yi\·es, more e'recially when the
reasoning organs are small. 'Vhcn Bene,·olence
is lar,!_!e. and ~\.cqu~J tiveness on! y moderate or full,
he will spend money. &c.• to ~ratit~· the other sex.
"\\rhen Self-E-.t-"elll and SecretiYeness are Yery
large~ and the rdlecti,-c f:lcultie~ ~dso large. th·e
person, so constituted, wi1l be ju lo\·e, nnd not
let others know it; but when Secreti,·eness is small,
he will feel much pleasure in confiding in others,
and even rc,•eal the whole of his mind. "\Vhen
Idenlity and l\Iirthfulness are ~mall . he will be
coarse.and e\·en \'Ulgar.jn his a.m:1tory expressions;
but wlum these organs are large, with large reflec-
tive faculties he wiJI be elegant and choice in his
.AMATIVENEss- HI
expressions. 'Vhen Conscientiousness and the
reflective organs are small, he will, at a11 times,
yield to his inclinations; but when Conscientious·
nef's is large, Approbativeness, Self-Esteem and
Caution small, will repent and appear confused
when others tell him of his proceedings, and will
feel diffident in the cmnpnny of females.
Y ERY LARGE.--Tbe individual possessio~ this
organ very large, if he have not large Finn·
ne~s, and the reasoning facu1 ties also large, will
yield to his inclinations, will be loose in his pro..
ccedings, and give ''ray to profligacy, obscenity,
licentiousuess, &c. and all l\inds of Yice resulting
from the abuse of Amativeness. But, when com-
binccl with large FirrnncRs n.nrl Con<:;cientiousness,
and large Reflective facnl tie~, will be very foud
of the society of "\vomen, and sacrifice every thing
for t!:cir sake. This org·m is freed from any thing
gross or indelicate, by the Imaginative and Rea-
soning organs being large or very large.
FuLL.-Ama.tivencss full, makes the person, so
constitut0rl,lm·e the other sex, but not to the extent
of putting himself out of the common routine of
Jife on their account; will not be particularly anx-
iolls to please them. For other combinations
see Amati\·eness large.
l\IoDERATE.-Amativene~s moderate, with Ideal-
ity und Reflective organs small, ·will not care
al;out the company of the other sex; if, however,
Adhesiveness be large, he will like them merely
as companions, nnd not from any amatory feeling;
he will be chaste, and will dislike all kind~ of
obscene language.

words to convey his meaning.
1\'IouERATE.-Does not f~el those disagreeable
sensations produced by a continuance of feelings
caused by misfortune, &c.; can pass his mind
from one thought or subject to another; soon for-
gets unpleasant occurrences; and will have great
versatiiity of talent. This organ acts on all the
others, and according to its size, so will its influ-
ence predominate.
VE.RYSMALL.-One having this organ very small,
is fickle, undecided, will not remain in the same
mind long; is always changing his opinions, _&c.;
has a hundred projects, but never nct.:ompltshes
any of them; is al·ways seeking for variety; finds
it extremeh• diffieult to fix his mind in studv;
lacks applic~uion,and indicates laziness. Fhghty,

and when Justice is small, they wi!l never keep

facrlties are large, the individual w11l sltow him-
self oft to good advantage, and appPn,r to know

Justice are large, he may be ahle to adhere to his

UsE.-This organ causes the feeling of friend-
ship; a desire to associate; attachment to per-
sons; inclination to love and be loved; love of
marriage, &c.
LARGE.-Those having this organ large, wiJI
become warm and devoted friends; and when
combined with large Ama.tiveness, will be a de-
voted lover; '"·ill sacrifice every thil}g for the ob-
ject of their attachment; and if there be large Be-
nevolence and small Acquisiti\·eness and Caution,
will be very apt to serve a friend, even to his own
injury; with Combativene~s and Firmness large,
will defend the rights of others, despite his own
interest. If Benevolence, l\Iirthfulness, Ideality,
and the Reflective organs are large, he will be
very popular, and his society courted. One with
large SecretiYeness and Caution, will be very se-
lect in his choice of friends; and with Self-esteem
small, will ue bashful and diffident in the company
of strangers. 'Vith Acquisitiveness small or mo-
derate, and Bene,·olence large, \\ill spend n10ney
freely, when in the company of friends; and if
Approbativeness is also large, will spend to ap-
pear on an equality. or with the endeavor to out·
do others.
'Vith Self-esteem, Combativeness and Destruc·
tivencss large, the individual will be inclined to
dictate and command; with large Concentrative-
ness and Destructiveness, will be reYengeful,
and take every opportunity to renew an old of·
fence or quarrel; and if combined with large Se-
67
cretiveness, will take eYery artful, cunning, un-
der-handed llJC'Jn~ to debas.! the objects of his re-
venge; and, if\. "h small Conscientiousness, will
have recourse to unrair, treacherous, despicable
means; in f.tct, he will accomplish the end in view
at all hazards.
But when Consciousne:'s, Adhesiveness, and
Firmness are large, he may be depended on; he
will be frank and candid, more especially when
Secretiveness is moderate.
VEltY LAnG~:.-\Vill be devoted to his [·icnds,
and desire to be in their company; wishf's them
to accompany him on all occasiolls; will risk life
and tortnne tor thPir sake~; their loss is in~npporta­
ble. and often leads to in~anitv. Thi"> is mort
likely to be the case when Benevolence, Hope
and Vcneration nre large, and Caution only mo-
derate. \Vlwn sneh a pci·son profes~c:> friend-
ship, he thinks th:tt he ne,·er· can do too lllltch for
his friend. But when Selt:csteem and Conecu tra-
tivcncss arc also large, and he becomes ollcnded,
he will be as hitter nn enemy a~ he wnc; before,
attached as a friend. \Vith large intellectual organs,
he will seek for the societ v of men of his own

fond of' dressing in male attire, und going secrelly
out of doors to fight with blackguards in the
street:-. After her marriage she constantly sought
occa~inn to fight with men. \Yhen she had guest~
at cl"uner~ she challenged the strr·ngest of them
after the repast to wrestle. H e like·wise knew a
lady. who, a.ltlJuugh of small stature, and d~licate
cnn~t.itution, was often summom•d before a jus-

fond of talking and enforcing his opinions on
others; and with Firmness Jarge, will be obsti-
nate, and not even listen to the argument of
others; and with love of Approbation large, will
be a great boaster of his own doings and exploits~
and he is sure to make himself the hero in his nar-
ratives; when Caution is full, he will not fight ex-
cept he is obliged of necessiry; such appear brave
when danger is far off; they prove the words of
Butler's Hudibras:
"He that fights and runs away,
Lives to fight another day."
MooERATE.-VVill never fight or quarrel, except
when very much provoked; and when Caution is
large, will always avoid blows and act the coward;
if Firmness is small, he will require energy and
force of character, and will not oppose others,
even when he is in the right; and when Benevo-
!ence and Approbation are large, will yield to
others in order not to offend them; with Venera-
tion and Self-esteem small, will be meek, hwnble,
and a poor dependent being.
S&tALL.-One having Combativeness small, will
not contend for his right; with Benevolence large,
will be mild, and amiable, and will surrender his
rights sooner than contend for them, und will
avoid quarrelling; he is tame and inoffensive;
though, when Approbativeness is large, he may
have shown himself off, and in the estimation of
bis friends appeared a brave man, especially when
Secretiveness is large; hundreds of these cases
have come unde-.· my observation.

Dr. Gall was led to the discoYery of this organ,
by comparing the heads of carnivorous with her-
baceous animals; in the former, he found the large
mass of h::ain to lay aLout the ears, and in the
lower and back regions of the head; whereas, the
latter presentt>d quite a distinct configuration; he
afterwards examined the heads of seven noted
murderers, and found the same portion of brain to

in front of Self-E'iteem-its exact location may bs known by
ctnwing a perpendicular line from the opening of the ear,
clirectly upwards, wruch will pnss through the centre of the

perseverance, determination, and consistency io
character.
LARGE.-One with this organ large, will be so
fixed and determined in any position he mav

in others; the object of care being according to
the faculty developed.
1\-looER.ATJo:.-One having this organ moderate,
will act from the impulse of the moment, and be
exceedingly rash and precipitate in aU his doings
•mless modified by large Causality and large
~ecretiveness; in this case the person will desire
to undertake and feel an almost ungovernable
impulse to act, but his reason prevents him; he
does not commit hitnself in expression, but with

doings.

be guided by the opimon of others; ·with Self E~·
teem large will he Cluite indim~rent, and first please
himself; will not condescend to plense others, they
must accord with his opinions; such a man hav-

forward honourable ~ourse, even if by so d.:>ing he
creates many enen:lles.
S~f.\Lt..-One with Approbativeness small and
Self-Bsteem large, will be so indilferent to the
opinion of others as to appear rude, forward, bold;
cares not whether he pleases or displeases. With

in his expressions as to give offence, more especi·
ally when Secretiveness is also moderate.

EXTERNAL SENSES. 119
GENUS I.-PERCFPTJVE CoMMON.
Theae perceive the existence and physic-al qualities of external
objle\t :met their relalions--convey to the mind the knowledge
which could no\ be derived through the extemal senses.
EXTERNAL SENSES.
Many eminent Philosophers have considered
the senses as the only source of our intelligence.
If this were the case, the more perfect the sen-
ses, the more perfect would be the intelligence.
How is it then, that many of the lower animals
have some of their senses much more powerful
than man-for instance, the Falcon, the Eagle
and the Vulture have a keener eye; the Hare,
the Deer and Donkey, a more acute sense of
hearing; the Wolf, the Dog and the Ox, a more
perfect smell; the Sheep and most herbivorous
animals, a more delicate sense of taste. Again,
the Idiot has all his senses perfect, and yet we
find him destitute of reason: but on the contrary,
we often find great and talen ted men who have
been defective in some of their most important
senses-for example, Milton and Homer were
blind, &c. It must be evident to the reader,
that the more we abandon facts for speculation,
the more we multiply difficulties in ascertaining
the true nature of the mind. The senses are
merely the inlets to the mind, they take co.g~i­
zance of bodies in the abstract, but the qualtttes
of such bodies are analyzed in the brain. The
five senses are Touch, Smelling, Taste, Hearing,
and Seeing."lf

voJumee, hut the n:uuro of lhe book forbicla fuuher rletaiJ.
120 SENSE OF TOUcH, ETC•
SENSE OF TOUCH,
Is the most extensive of all senses; is distribu-
ted over the whole surface of the body, and gives
us direct impressions of pleasure and pain. This
is the elementary sense, for it is found in the
lowest class of animals, when all the others are
wanting; all the others being mere modifinations
of it, accommodated to certain qualities of bodtes.
All that is not seen, heard. smelt, or tasted, ~s
appreciated by the Touch: this instructs us in a
~reat measure of the qualities of substances which
Jt directly concerns us to lmow, as their temper-
ature, consistence, dryness, figure, size, or their
distance, &c. It corrects the errors of the other
senses.
SENSE OF TASTE .
This sense resembles closely that of Touch;
we may judge of the quality of bodies through
the medium of the tongue.
SENSE OF SMELL.
This sense differs from the two last, inasmuch
as it does not require immediate contact; it is
perfected by the loss of the other senses. It
beco~es blunted by the application of strong
matenals to the membrane on which the Olfao-
tory nen·e is distributed.
SENSE OF HEARING.
Hearing makes men and animals acquainted
with remote objects, and i~ the first to perceive
external things through an intermedium, the air.
The nerves of He.aring arc found from the lowe3t

The eye is a perfect optietd instrument; it is
cornposed of several part~; the.:>e are the Co::-nea,
Iris, Chrystalline lens, Yitrcous humor, Aqueous
humor, Hetina., Optic nerve, &c. The mechan-
ism of vision is performed in the following man-
n cr " The rays of light pas:;ing from any o!Jject
to •: ~ eye are those which p:.bs through ths iris,
and. this iris dilates or contracts in proportion
to ;,.:; stimulus rcecived; the rays admitted by
t:.e ;ris pass through the aqueous humor, :;.nd
rr:e~ t "\Vith the crystalline ]ens which powerfully
refra;ts them from its density, and lenticular
shapf ·, being brought towards the perpendicular
by this body, they pass on towards the retina
throL gh the vitreous humor, which being les~
dens1 ·, presen·es the refraction produced by the
cryst rrlline; the rays now being concentrated
strike at a spot on the retina, from thence the
object is transmitted to the brain through the
medium of the optic nerve.

classes of animals np to man. The human ear
cuns!sts of three distinct parts; the one placed
external1y, is intended to collcet sounds; the
middle car includPs the cavity td' the tympanum,
the small bones contained in this cavitv, the mas-
toid cells, eustachion tubes, &c. 'I'l!e intcrnal
ear, is the most important part of the apparatus,
for here the sounds are anuly?.cd and c0nvevr.d
to the brain. Many persons n ppo~e thnt music
is the result of this sense: if so, the sheep, the
eat, the dog, and the hog wunld excel man in the
performance on a musical in.;trument, for their
organ of hearing is more perfect than that of
man. Again, many birds sing and yet possess a
very imperfect ear. Other philosophers have
said that the formation ef the throat was the
c::mse of birds singing. How is it then, that the
female does not sing as well us the male, or that
mnnv birds that do not, have as perfectly form€'d
throat~ as those that do. The mystery is
explained immediately t>n observing the shape of
the head-there, and tbere alone is the cause of
the ditlerence.
SENSE OF !IGJIT.
This sense is a modification of that of touch,
light being its special stimulus; the pleasures and
advantarres derived through the medium of the
eye nrc ~o striking, tha' •he vision ~as been ?-nd
is, a subject of unive~·~a11bterest. fhe eye IS a

it signifies that it is unu~ually small: \Yhen 3, ;j or

signs +~ or more, and.-? or 1e~~, which bein.g
placed with a figure, stgmfies tl~at the orga~ IS

thry consti utc the higher mu} mon: important part
of the brain.
· ''The ossili('ation of the hones of the slmll is a

'; THtJS WE FIND THAT THE BONES OF THE HEAD ARE
llOULDED TO THE BRAIN, ~\NO THE PECULIAR SHAPF:S OP'
THE BONES OF THE HEAD ARE DETERMINED BY TrH~
ORIGINAL PECULlARlTIES OF THE SHAPF. OF' THE BRAIN."
-Si1· C. Bell, Vol. ii, page 82.
Cuvier says: ., In all mammiferous animals, the
brain is moulded in the cavity of the cranium,
which it exactly fills; so that the description of
the osseous part, affords us a knowledge of~ n.t
)east, THE EXTERNAL FORM OF THF ~IEDULLAftY 1tL\::iS
WITHIN."
Sir C. Bell says, he has seen a case wnere t!Je
skull decreased with the brain. "It occurred in an
indi\ridual who died at the age of thirty-two, after
having Jabored under chronic insanity for upwards
of ten years, and whose mental weakness augment-
eel in propo1·tion to the diminution of the brain and
shrinking of the skull. The diminution attracted
his own attention during life."
A somewhat sir.1ilar case may be seen in the
cabinet of Doctor lVIussev, Ohio l\1edical College.
It is the slmll of a Frenci1mn.n, who fell from fhe
top of a house, and indented in a great degree the
right side of the frontal bone, at the samf-l time
severely injuring the brain; the consequence vYas,
the anterior lobes of the brain diminished in bulk~
so much so, as to cause the internal table of the
skull to recede from the external, causing an ex·
traordinary frontal sinus, or cavity, extending the
whole length of the. frontal bone. The man b~­
came an IDIOT, and lzved seven years after tlte accz·
dent. .

Carus says in his Comparative Anatomy, page
231: "When, however, a more perfect evolutiOJ t
of individular portions of the chain of central
masses take place, as invariably happens with re-
gard TO THE BRAtN, and occasionally also in the
Spina} marrow, the EVIDENCE OJ:<' THE SEPARATE EX..
ISTENCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL MASSES IS NO LONGER
DOUBTFUL.''
From Dr. John D. Godm:m, late Professor of
Anatomy, New-York:
"If it be true, that certain protuberances of the
skull are found in numerous individuals, and each
of these individuals are remarkable for the posses-
sion of given qualities, or dispositions of mind;
and if it be true, that a number of persons are
found wanting in the same qualities of mind, and,
at the same time, destitute of the first mentioned
protuberances of the skull and brain; it is perfect-
ly justifiable, aftet' a sufficient extensive examina-
tion has been mnde to decide upon the general
rule, to declare that the protuberance is a correct
indication of the mental quality; or that the mani-
festation of the mental qualities indicates the pre-
sence of certain protuberan~es upon the skull.
"This is the foundation upon which the doc-
trines of Gall and Spurzheim rest-PURELY UPON
lli6 APPENDIL
ossERVATION; and this is the reason why th~se
doctrines have so TRIUMPHANTLY ouTLIVED ALL THE
MISREPRESENTATION AND VIOLENCE OF OPPOSITION.
"In this view of the case, it is altogether unes-
sential whether the protuberance be caused by the
brain within, or the membrane of bone without.
The fact of the relation between the natural pro-
tuberance and the intellectual character, is not in
the slightest degree altered by our being unable
to account for it. It is because we comtnence
with a determination to see and believe in a cer-
tain way, that our improvement is so much im·
peded, and our advances are so slow. We ap-
pear afraid to discover truth, lest we be obliged
to relinquish some cherished nolif)n, and we find
so much fault with those who attempt to arrive
at a better knowledge, as if they were doing so
with a view to our injury. ~l we remain unwil-
ling to submit to the evidence of our own senses, we
certainly are under no necessity of denouncing
those who do: yet such is the pen·erseness of our .
nature. that nothing is more common than this
preposterous conduct.
'• As a general rule, it is perfectly safe to infer
that the opponents of Gall and Spurzheim do not
understand the exact nature of the case against
which they dispute. At least no man who has
ever set himsolf honestly to work to examine the
subject fairly, has remained in opposition. A
great deal of ingenuity has been wasted in discus·
sion on both sides. The opposition taking it for
granted, that the whole doctrine is one supported
merely by plausible arguments, and therefore to
_be overthrown by argumentation; and the de·
fenders of Gall and Spurzheim unaV'ailingly en·
tleavoring to induce tho~e to reason from facts,

be perfectly satisfactory.
"But a few years have elapsed since the wri-

join in the hue and cry against them; so much was
his mind imbued with the prejudices derived from
the fulminations of a public teacher, whose "zeal"

Columbia, South Carolina, July 1st, 1838.
DEAR Sra:-
You desire my opinions of Phrenology.
·It is universally conceded, that all intellectual
phenomena, all sensation, consciousness, or per-
ception, and all voluntary action, depend on the
brain. You have no feeling but in the brain; for
by cutting, tying or compressing a distant nerve,
the sensation it would otherwise convey to the
brain, is stopt in its course; whether it commence
in the leg, or in the arm, or in any ()ther distanl
part. In like manner the muscles of voluntary

investigating to obtain arguments against it; this occurred in the

motion are paralyzed if the appropriate nerve Lj
cut or tied, or compressed, between the brain and
the muscle. By the brain, I mean the cerebrum,
the cerebellum, and medulla oblongata, and the
upper portion of the spinal column.
THE BR.\IN DoEs NOT ACT As oNE oRGAN. The
experiments of Bell, of Florens, of!\Iageudie, &c.
prove th3t difrerent parts ha,-e different functions,
as the cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla oblon-
gata. Indeed. every part of the brain is so mani-
festly difierent in structure from the other parts,
that it would be just as reusonal>le to ascribe the
same functions to the leg, and to the nose, as to
the optic ner.\·e and the medulla oblongata. Dif..
ference of con~truction, composition, and loca-
tion, must of course, imply difference of function.
The optic nen·e has one duty, the auditory nerve
another.
THE BRAl~, THERF..FORE, IS A CO.UPOU~D ORGAN;
consisting of parts destined to perform different
functions or duties. one part cannot perform the
duties of another.
The same neurilema or sheath incloses nerves
destined solelv to convey sensation') to the brain,
and nen·es destined solely to conYey the orders
of the brain to the Yoluntarymuscles. All known
facts tend to prove that every part of the animal
body is app~·opriated to its own pecular function
or duty, wluch cannot be well performed by any
other part.

are defective, idiocy is the re!':ult; and we disco-

of any faculty; if a man i~ ·wanting in the organ

This head indicates to the Phrenologist a mind
of a gigantic m·der, and such has been the mind
of Dr. Cooper. His Firmness, Combativeness,
Destructiveness and Concentrativeness, have en-
abled him to trample down and expose error, and
wield with success his mighty pen against bigotry
and superstition. Few men ever possessed more
moral courage than he. His Conscientiousness
is remarkably large, which combined with small
Veneration and large Reasoning facul tics, cause
him to be regardless of the frown of friends or foe,
so long as he considers he is vindieating the cause
of freedom. In consequence of his bold and de-
termined conduct, he has had many enemies; and
such men always have had, and always will meet
with, opposition from the grovelling mass. In fu·
ture ages he will be admired for having dared to
express himself as his reason dictated. Dr. C.
was examined by me in 1\iay, 1838.
