money because it seems like at any point
they can get sucked with the national
security order I mean seriously could
you try to everyone thinks the ETS are
gonna land and give us one of these
devices number one that technology would
be so many thousands of years advanced
from where we are no one would figure it
out you&#39;d have to do a multi-billion
dollar reverse engineering study number
two that&#39;s not why they&#39;re here they in
other words could everyone always asks
and I get this asked by people in
politics well if they&#39;re here why don&#39;t
they just land on the White House lawn
and force the issue I said because
they&#39;re wiser than that they know that
unless we as the people learn through
the steps of first stop line to each
other bring out the truth do this or so
there&#39;s no learning curve so if it was
imposed externally that would be about
as efficacious as us trying to impose
Jeffersonian democracy on the Warlord&#39;s
of Afghanistan so that is not a solution
and they are too wise to know that
thirdly if there was something that was
as overt as that begging the question
whether you can make hiding or tell us
what it is and we bypass this process of
coming together to do it I think we&#39;re
gonna lose a big lesson of what it means
to come together as human community to
do something and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s
trivial I mean I think that it&#39;s like if
you were had a child and every time it
stumbled you caught it so it never
learned to walk and you infantilized it
to the point of it never standing on its
own these civilizations I personally
believe and there&#39;s a lot of ancient
evidence for this I&#39;ve been around
thousands millions of years
and and I think that they&#39;re they&#39;re
watching us evolve in fits and starts
into something resembling a world
civilization but that we&#39;ve got no we
made some mistakes in the last number of
decades and we&#39;ve gone off track we need
to get back on track but if they did
something over to correct that for us
there would be no teachable moment then
moreover what&#39;s even worse is that the
intelligence community would love for
such an event to happen because they
would instantly say see we&#39;re being
invaded by aliens
give us another two trillion dollars for
Star Wars so I think that we have to if
I figured that out I&#39;m sure these
civilizations have I think they&#39;re
really looking for us to come together
find our own resources and make this
change happen now can there be
inspiration guidance that people have
had sure I know people who worked in
classified projects that have had some
amazing contact experiences based on
that were able to get exactly what
needed you know one of these devices to
be operational actually the man that we
were contracted with three years at four
years ago but I think that in terms of
it being more overt than that it needs
to come through humans where the
children of Earth were responsible for
this planet and I think the only way we
would see a larger intervention is under
certain worst-case scenarios which we
don&#39;t need to go into but really
cataclysmic biosphere or something like
that collapse and and I think short of
that it&#39;s it&#39;s incumbent on us to
educate each other and come together as
community and make this happen and in
that process it&#39;s that in and of itself
is edifying and evolutionary and taking
a shortcut around that I think is
potentially deleterious to our evolution
as a species no matter how attractive
that might look
oh yeah we&#39;ve done things at the their
headquarters and I did a briefing for
their board in fact uh senator Claiborne
Pell those of you when they were poor
like me who went to college on Pell
grants and thanked him was there I
thanked him actually I said I wouldn&#39;t
have gone that thank you I was raised
very very poor and we have and and
there&#39;s a lot of support in those
quarters yes and so there are many
organizations that are supportive and
interested in this entire subject and
many of them have gone on to become
these ambassadors to the universe and
and learn and we did just a one-day a
program at their retreat there in
pedalin near Petaluma and you know where
it is it&#39;s a nice facility there in the
north of the San Francisco Bay Area and
so yes there there are wonderful groups
like that that we&#39;re collaborating with
and I&#39;ve done trainings for
