EDiTORfAL Note : This book is not an official publication of The Theo­
sophical Society, nor is The Society responsible for any of the contents. But it
has been compiled with the utmost care, with the intention to provide all available
facts about The Society and its membership, and an appreciative survey of the
races, nations and faiths of the world.
FROM THE EDITOR
T he International Theosophical
Year Book will either meet a long-
felt want, or will so create a want
that members of The Theosophical
Society all over the world will
wonder how they could have done
without it for so many years.
The Theosophical Society needs
a Year Book, and here it is as
best we could fashion it for a
start. I hope it will be very
welcomfe, and that we shall in due
course be inundated with sugges­
tions for its improvement.
Its first object Is in handy form
to acquaint the 30,000 members
of The Society with what is the
state of the Theosophical world in
every country, so that they may
become increasingly Theosophical-
Society-conscious; for the more
they become Theosophical-Soci­
ety-conscious the more will they
pull their weight as members of
The Theosophical Society to their
own growing happiness and to the
helping of the world towards
brotherhood, peace and prosperity.
Its second object is to become
a link between member and mem­
ber, Lodge and Lodge, Section
and Section, so that The Theo­
sophical Society may become even
more of a family, with all the
amenities of the family life, than
it already is. The Year Book is
not only to be a guide as to what
is going on in the Theosophical
World, but also a means of com­
munication between those who
ordinarily feel undesirably put of
touch with others who ail over the
world are working as they are
working for Brotherhood and for
Truth.
The third object is to keep the
outer world acquainted with what
The Theosophical Society is, with
what it is doing year by year, and
how it is organized in country
after country. The Year Book is
as much for the outer world as
for the Theosophical world.
Every Lodge, whether English-
speaking or not, should have a
copy of this Year Book in its
Library. Every Section should
have several copies in its Library.
And every member should have a
copy in his home. Furthermore,
every Lodge and every Section
might well present copies to local
libraries and reading rooms, to
newspaper offices, and to individ­
uals whose positions make it
useful for them to*have copies
available.
I am very much obliged to
Mrs. Ransom, late General Secre­
tary of the English and of other
2 T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
Sections, who began the work of
compiling the Year Book with the
aid of many helpers, and to the
staff of the Press Department at
Adyar, who completed it. I
am also much obliged to those
who have ^sent material for the
Book. I hope that for the 1938
issue we shall have world-wide
co-operation from our member­
ship. W e have only been able to
include in this year’s issue a
comparatively smp.ll number of
names in our Theosophical W ho’s
W ho. I hope the list will be
much larger in subsequent issues.
This first issue is more of a
ballon d'essai than a model pro­
duction ; and will, I hope, as the
years pass, improve so radically
that no member will feel he can
afford to be without it. W e have
priced the Year Book as low as
we possibly could. In fact, it
will be impossible for us to give
any discount off the published
price, even to our own booksellers.
I request our various Theosophical
Publishing Houses to be good
enough to'handle the book without
asking discount, as a piece of
valuable propaganda. W e shall
•make no profit, and we do not
want to.
George S. Arundale
Adyar,
October 1st., 1936.
THE WORLD S CALENDARS
T he following notes throw light on
the monthly calendars which follow :
Christian : Adjusted to a Solar Year,
12 uneven months. Some festivals
occur on lunar phases. The Greek
Church follows the old Russian
calendar, about a fortnight earlier.
Midnight to midnight is a day. Most
Oriental calendars count dawn to dawn
as a day.
Jewish: Luni-solar, in accordance
with a system arranged in the 4th
century a .d . The Jews now employ
an Era of the Creation, whose epoch is
taken as 7 October 3761 b .c . Last
new year, 17 Sept. 1936 or 1 Tishri
5697; other months: Marcheshvan,
Kislev, Tebeth, Shebat, Adar, Nisan,
Iyar, Sivan, Tammuz, Ab, Ellul.
Mohammedan : Lunar, dating from
the Hejira era, day after Mahomet’s
flight from Mecca, which occurred on
the night of 15 July 622 a .d . Last
new year, 24 March 1936 or 1
Muharram 1355 ; other months: Saphar,
Rabia I, Rabia II, Jornada I, Jornada
II, Rajab, Shaaban, Ramadan, Shawall,
Dulkaada, Dulheggia.
P arsi : The solar year of 365 days is
divided into six unequal fixed periods
called Gahambars, festival times. The
Persian era dates from 632 A.D., the
accession of Yezdijird, the last of the
Sassanian line of Kings. Last new year,
6 September 1936 or 1 Farvardin 1306.
Other months : Ardibehest, Khordad,
Tir, Amardad, Sheherevar, Meher,
Avan, Adar, Deh, Behaman, and
Asfendarmad. The 12 Parsi months
have 30 equal days and at the end of
the last month five extra sacred days are
added to make up the solar year. The
names of these days are Ahunavad,
Ushtavad, Spentomad, Vohukshathra,
and Vahishtoyashta. As yet the Parsi
calendar does not allow for correction
through a leap-year ; consequently after
every leap-year, the Parsi new year is
one day behind the previous coincidence
with the Christian calendar. Example,
1940, September 5th not 6th will be
the Parsi New Year.
T H E T H E O S O P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 3
Hindu: Limi-solar. The Samvat
era dates from 57 *
b .c. Months are
divided into the sudi or bright fort­
night, and badi or dark. Each fort­
night contains 15 tithis. Last new
year 14 April 1936, or 134,3 Vaisakha
1 ; other months; Jyaistha, Ashada,
Sravana, Bhadra, Asvina, Karttika,
Marga, Pous, Maggha*, P h a l g u n a .
Chaitra.
The Fasli year (N. W. India) Luni-
Solar, was derived from a combination
of the* Hejira and Samvat*years by the
order of Akbar. Last New Year, 1
Oct. 1936, or 1 Asvina 1344: other
months: Karttika, Marga, Pausha,
Magha, Phalguna, Chaitra, Vaisakha,
Jyaistha, Ashada, Sravana, Bhadra I,
Bhadra II.
The Bengali ye$r seems also to have
been related at one time to the Hejira,
but the fact of it being Solar made it
lose 11 days each year.
Buddhist: Most festivals occur on
full-moons of Samvat calendar.
Jain,: Months and years correspond
with Hindu dates; but intervening
periods in months do not correspond, as
a day is dropped or added according to
the phase of the moon and only the
decision of Jodphur Haharaj, an eminent
Sadhu, is final. Jain Year " Vir
Samvat ’ ’ 2464 begins 4 November
1937.

THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY
The Theosophical Society is
a world-wide international organi­
zation, formed At New York
on 17tb November 1875, and
incorporated later in India with its
Headquarters at Adyar, Madras,
It is an unsectarian body of
seekers after Truth, Who endeav­
our to promote Brotherhood and
strive to serve humanity. Its
three declared OBJECTS#are:
First— To form a nucleus of
the Universal Brother­
hood of Humanity, with­
out distinction of race,
creed, sex, caste or
colour.
Second— To encourage the
study of Comparative
Religion, Philosophy and
Science.
Third—T o investigate unex­
plained laws of Nature
and the powers latent in
man.
The Theosofhical Society
is composed of men and women
who are united by their approval
of the above Objects, by their
determination to promote Brother­
hood, to remove religious, racial
and other antagonisms, and who
wish to draw together all persons
of goodwill, whatsoever their
opinions.
Their bond of union is a
common search and aspiration for
Truth. They hold that Truth
should be sought by study, by re­
flection, by service, by purity of
life and by devotion to high
ideals. They hold that Truth
should be striven for, not imposed
by authority as a dogma. They
consider that belief should be the
result of individual study or of
intuition, and not its antecedent,
and should rest on knowledge, not
on assertion. They see every
religion as an expression of the
Divine Wisdom and prefer its
study to its condemnation, and its
practice to proselytism. Peace is
their watchword, as Truth is
their aim.
• WHAT IS THEOSOPHY?
Theosophy offers a philosophy
which renders life intelligible, and
demonstrates the inviolable nature
of the laws which govern its
evolution. It puts death in its
rightful place as a recurring
incident in an endless life, opening
the gateway to a fuller and more
radiant existence. It restores to
the world the Science of the
Spirit, teaching man to know the
Spirit as himself, and the mind
and body as his servants. It
illuminates the scriptures and
doctrines of religions by unveiling
their hidden meanings, thus
justifying them at the bar of
intelligence as, in their original
purity, they are ever justified in
the eyes of intuition. The Society
claims no monopoly of Theosophy,
as the Divine Wisdom cannot be
limited; but its Fellows seek to
understand it in ever-increasing
measure. All in sympathy with
the Objects of The Theosophies!
Society are welcomed as members,
and it rests with the member to
become a true Theosophist.

WHAT IS MY POLICY?
B y G e o r g e S . A r u n d a l e
T o each President, as he assumes
an office the like of whiqh exists
nowhere throughout the world,
comes what may be called an
Instrument of Instructions— a
general outline of the work to be
accomplished during his or her
Presidentship. Such Initructions
may be a matter of the intuition
or they may perchance be hints
from Those to whom The Theo-
sophical Society ultimately be­
longs.
For myself, this Instrument of
Instructions requires that first of
all I shall do my best to promote
within 'fhe Society an active spirit
of Freedom and Friendship, so
that every member feels perfectly
free to express his.views and con­
victions, always remembering that
such expression demands courtesy
of utterance, no aggressive denun­
ciation of other views and other
convictions, but rather respect for
these and, on the part of those in
whom the power of brotherhood
already dwells in strength, gener­
ous appreciation.
Every individual who joins The
Theosophical Society becomes a
member of a Company of the
Free, each constituent unit of
which recognizes that Freedokn
is inseparable from a successful
search for Truth, for Truth is the
heritage of all and comes to each
in forms most easily recognizable.
He also becomes a member of a
Company of Friends, each con­
stituent unit of which knows that
Friendship is a universal form of
Truth. Where there is Freedom
there is Truth. Where there is
Friendship there is Truth. Where
there is Freedom directed by
Friendship, there Truth is being
discerned.
.More than knowledge, Friend­
ship matters. More than faith
or belief, conviction or opinion,
Friendship matters. Moffe than
the forms of Theosophy as set
forth in our classic literature
matters the Life of Theosophy
which is Friendship. When we
really know the forms we shall
perceive that they are but the
shadows of Friendship at work
inspiring all life to achieve King-
ship in the Universe of Friend­
ship, and to abide therein for ever.
A member of The Theosophical
Society who is friendly to all, be
they who they may, appreciative
of all, understanding of all, is a
Theosophist even though he may
never have opened a book de­
scribing the Science of Theosophy.
But he will be a better friend
if he is an earnest student of
Friendship’s Science, which is
Theosophy. Therefore, differences
must enrich us and increase in
us the spirit of solidarity. They
must not arouse antagonism, or
we are their slaves when we
should be their masters.
21
22 ; ^ H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
Next, this Instrument of Instruc­
tions requires that I shall be on
the lookout to strengthen The
Theosophical Society in every
possible way, both by insisting on
its fundamental purposes and by
aiding in the unveiling of any
facets of the great Diamond of
Theosophy on which less stress
may so far have been laid. Or
it may be my duty to try to effect
an adjustment in connection with
certain existing interpretations jof
Theosophy.
As regards the fundamental
purposes of The Theosophical
Society, these seem to me to be the
spread of Friendship and Freedom,
as I have already indicated, and
the study of Theosophy as the
Science of Life and therefore the
Science of Life’s two great pillars
— Friendship and Freedom. Theos­
ophy and The Theosophical
Society are twins. They must
grow in beauty side by side, even
though it be true that membership
of The Society does not require a
study of Theosophy.
As regards the natural unfold-
ment of Theosophy to eyes be­
coming increasingly accustomed
to its light, I find that the four
great interpretations of Theos­
ophy so far vouchsafed to us are
now to be enriched by a fifth.
The first was archetypal— Theos­
ophy as Wisdom, through H. P.
Blavatsky. The second was
Theosophy as W ill and Activity,
through Annie Besant. The third
was Theosophy as Science, through
C. W . Leadbeater. The fourth
was Theosophy as the science
of self-contained Individuality,
through J. Krishnamurti. Krishna-
murti has made Theosophy subject­
ive, and therefore calls it by no
name. ^Others have emphasized
Theosophy’s objective aspect, and
give it a myriad names.
I see the fifth as Theosophy as
Beauty, of which it would seem
that Rukmini Arundale will be
one of «the principal pioneers.
Each interpretation is different
from all the others. Each may
seem in many ways a contradic­
tion of one or more of the others.
But all are facets of the Eternal
Diamond of Theosophy, and
through each shines the Light of
Truth.
Finally, as regards any adjust­
ment which seems indicated, I
am moved to lay less stress on
the occult thanjms been necessary
for some years, and to lay stress
on the individual himself coming
face to face with Theosophy and
its value both to him and to the
world, discouraging rather than
encouraging reliance on external
authority and external revelation.
I do not for a moment ignore these.
External authority has its great
value, as has external revelation.
To believe even when we have
not seen has, under certain condi­
tions, a value less perceptible in
these modern days than in times
gone by. It is as possible to
under-estimate the value of author­
ity and revelation, and incident­
ally religion and ceremonial, as
to over-estimate it. But we have
been passing through a period
of growth in The Theosophical
T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 23
Society in which, by reason of the
presence in our midst of H. P.
Blavatsky, Annie Besant and
C. W . Leadbeater, unquestionable
authority and scientific revelation
have loomed large. Some may
deem they have loomed too large.
Be that as it may, we now, as I
hold, need to swing the pendulum
back to individual experience, to
individual intuition, to «the chal­
lenge of the individual “ I ” .
Further, this Instrument of
Instructions seems to require that
I should do all possible to encour­
age the relating of Theosophy
more practically and actively to
the world and its affairs, largely
through the Theosophical Order
of Service. It is borne in upon
me that only in the Science of
Theosophy are to be found the
solutions of the great problems
facing the world in every depart­
ment of its life. External panaceas
may temporarily alleviate, but
only Theosophy can cure.
The Instrument of Instructions
— please remember that I am
using this phrase in no formal
sense whatever— further requires
me to relate Theosophy to Youth,
by showing that Theosophy stands
for the spirit of Youth no less than
for the spirit of Trtith. A recon­
structed Round Table should be
potent in promoting such relation.
It may be a platitude to say that
the hope of the future lies with the
young. But it is a truth insistent
in its call to us to place at the
disposal of Youth all that we have
of wisdom and of power. I do
not think that any Lodge of The
Theosophical Society is really
effective save as part of its work
lies among the younger generation.
A great restoration of Theos­
ophy, the Eternal Wisdom, has
been vouchsafed to us. Wonder­
ful commentaries on Theosophy
are at our disposal in our classic
literature, in pronouncements by
the wise, in revelations by seers.
Now is the time for us to set to
work to gain experience for our­
selves, doubtless with the aid of
all these, for unless Theosophy
is our own experience it is not
Theosophy to us in fact. Let us
receive that which is offered to us,
be it in terms of suggested hy­
potheses, or of external authority,
or of external revelation. No one
is ever the worse for listening in
a spirit of sympathy and under­
standing. But let us judge in
terms of our emotions, our minds,
our intuitions, our wills. Let us
come to our own conclusions and
move forwards on our individual
ways. Theosophy may begin by
being a dogma. It must end by
being an inspiration and a light.
It may begin by being a dictator
and an acid test of orthodoxy. It
must end by being a friend and a
link with all. It may begin by
being form. It must end by being
Life.
24 T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L YEA R BOOK, 1937
A SEVEN-YEAR PLAN
Dr. Arundale inaugurated his Presi­
dential regime with a Seven-Year Plan
for the strengthening both of the Inter­
national Headquarters at Adyar, and
the Theosophical activities in the fifty
countries In which The Society is
organized. The Plan is well under way,
though much remains to be accom­
plished as regards certain items.
The first basic principle of the Plan
is that eveFy development must be
financially self-supporting, and must def­
initely contribute to the solidarity of T-he
Society. The President’s proposals •
were :
INTERNATIONAL
1. M anuals o f T h eosoph y: A
graded series of books to meet the re­
quirements of readers at different ages,
and students interested in special aspects
of life.
2. International Theosophical
Propaganda Fund: To consolidate
and strengthen the existing resources,
and to be administered by the Executive
Committee.
3. S h o r t-W a v e Theosophical
B roadcasting S tation: A donor of
Rs. 5,000 towards the cost of a Radio
Station has decided that until it is
practicable the interest shall be payable
to the Besant Memorial School.
4. Im provem ent o f P ropagan da:
The Publicity and the Press Depart­
ments set up at the Convention 1934 have
done splendid work under Mrs. Sellon
and Mr. J. L. Davidge respectively.
Unfortunately Mrs. Sellon died after a
serious operation in London in Septem­
ber 1936 ; she combined rare qualities
of organizing ability, tact and judgment,
besides the charm of a gracious hostess
and benefactor. Mrs. Adeltha Henry
Peterson was appointed Acting Publicity
Officer. The circulation of The Theos-
ophist is increasing. The Adyar News
was expanded into The Theosophical
World, which has proved a very suc­
cessful venture. Certain Lodges have
tried the dramatic interpretation of
Theosophy and found it gripping. In­
ternational lecturers are moving through
the Sections more freely. The Cam­
paigns for Straight Theosophy 1935,
Evolution 1935-6, and Understanding
1936-7 have. popularized the funda­
mentals of Theosophy in nearly fifty
countries.
DEVELOPMENT OF ADYAR
1. A dyar L ib ra ry : An entirely
new building is required, fitted in
accordance with the most scientific
library standards and providing adequate
space for many students. The Library
has been overhauled, and the Adyar
Library Association was formed in 1935
to extend its cultural influence.
2. V asanta Press and Theo-
sophical P ublishing H o u se : A re­
organization scheme is taking effect.
Both offices are under new management
and working with greater life and effi­
ciency.
3. Besant M em orial S ch ool:
This proposal, in compliance with the
last definitely-expressed wish of Dr.
Besant, materialized immediately. The
School is going splendidly, as is indicat­
ed in the Inspector’s reports and in the
comment on them by the Director of
Public Instruction. Dr. Arundale is
trying to collect an endowment fund of
Rs. 200,000 or £16,000 or $80,000 to
make the School financially safe for ever.
He hopes that a School Village Com­
munity will be living on its own spacious
grounds not far away from Adyar, and
that there will shortly be a College and
eventually a University. Their Excel­
lencies the Viceroy and the Countess of
Willingdon graciously expressed their
interest in the School and sent a donation
towards its funds. Dr. Rabindranath
Tagore on his visit to Adyar in
November 1934 became a patron of the
school.
4. Adyar Fellowships, to enable
younger people representing many
nations to live for a time at The Society’s
Headquarters, and become imbued with
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 25
the artist’s spirit. The T.P.H. is
already financing the Besant Fellowship.
5. Theosophical Training Centre,
for equipment in (a) the principles of
Theosophy, (b) the science of lecturing,
(c) the study of world conditions and the
application of Theosophy thereto.
6. Theosophical Press B ureau:
This has developed satisfactorily. The
Press Department supplies news to the
Press of India and correspondents in
other countries. Wider co-ordination is
proposed, embracing the European
Press Federation and other nlws services
with a view to creating a worldwide
Theosophical network of press bureaux.
7. F ilm o f A d y a r : A film showing
the beauty spots of Adyar, Headquarters,
Convention Groups, etc., is being ex­
hibited simultaneously in several
countries.
8. Y ou th : (a) Besant Scout Camp :
This camping centre was inaugurated
immediately after the President’s acces­
sion, andihas been a great success. It is
a miniature Gillwell Park. Over a thou­
sand Scouts use it every year. During
the Diamond Jubilee Convention (1935)
400 Rover Scouts camped on this ground.
(b) Adyar Youth Lodge, named
after Dr. Besant. The Vasanta Youth
Lodge, virile and vital, is a focus of
youth activity ; it makes close contact
with the college youth of Madras.
9. A d ya r P la y e rs: Many excellent
presentations have been given at Adyar
and Madras. This group is co-operating
with the International Academy of the
Arts.
10. A d y a r Theatre : An architect
of Shantiniketan, Rabindranath Tagore’s
School in Bengal, has designed a
Theatre in which the performances of
the International Academy of the Arts
will be given.
11. Adyar M useum : In embzfyo
this already exists, and a valuable
collection of relics is being built up.
12. Shrine o f G reatness: The
President projects a scheme which may
take many years to complete, namely, a
Shrine of Greatness, in three sections,
containing pictures or statues of the
greater workers for Brotherhood
throughout the ages, greater workers
for Religions, and greater workers for
Truth, also a memorial perpetuating in
- visible form by means of statues or
pictures the figures of outstanding
workers in The Theosophical Society.
Already the ‘*Garden of Remembrance ’ ’
has been erected on the sacred spot
where on September 21, 1933, the physi­
cal body of Dr. Besant was cremated.
The ashes of Dr. Besant and of Bishop
Leadbeater repose there in peace, and
the garden faces that North to which
they ever turned.
13. International Bureaux, or
Clearing Houses, for all progressive
activity in the cause of advancing
Brotherhood. This plan began to take
shape during the Geneva World Con­
gress 1936.
Dr. Arundale’s other projectsYelate to
the Adyar Estate, which was intensively
organized and improved during 1935-6.

HEADQTTARTEBS
Adyar is the ^Watch-Tower from
which the President of The Theosophi-
cal Society directs the world-wide work.
It was the home of the President-
Founder and H. P. Blavatsky, and
of Dr. Besant the second President,
and today it is the home of Dr.
Arundale. Situated seven miles south of
Madras, Headquarters was acquired by
Colonel Olcott in 1882. It was then
known as Huddlestone’s Gardens, and
the purchase price was nominal for the
reason that the high officials of Madras,
who had built summer residences on the,
Adyar River, moved to Ootacamund
with the opening of the railway to the
foot o f1the Nilgiris. Years later the
President-Founder wrote “ We have
never regretted our choice, for Adyar is
a sort of Paradise.”
Adyar is indeed one of the world’s
beauty spots. The estate is bordered
on the north by the Adyar River and on
the east the Bay of Bengal rolls up the
beach. Within the compound lives an
international community, whose offices
and bungalows are dotted over the
estate, some hundred families making
their homes here, in addition to a
fluctuating group of visitors which in­
creases towards convention time in
December. Accommodation for visitors
is provided for European guests at Lead-
beater Chambers and for Indians at the
Bhojanasala, though one finds Indians
living at Chambers and Europeans at
the Indian hostel. It is a matter of
taste, not of nationality.
Adyar is actually a successful experi­
ment in Theosophical living. The
community is international. Each re
ligion has its own shrine or temple in
the grounds, but on all important
occasions a joint ceremony is held in
the Great Hall, where Buddhists, Jains,
Christians, Hindus, Parsis, Moham­
medans and Hebrews join in worship of
That which is behind the diverse forms
of all religions. The community life at
Adyar is functional, and is successful
because its members have come together,
not from any desire to lead the com­
munity life as such, but because they are
all working for Theosophy and The
Theosophical Society, each along the
line of his maximum-individual express­
ion. This is the strength of Adyar.
Within the Adyar compound, which is
more or less a huge garden, many of
its trees imported from other countries,
are also extensive fruit gardens, groves
of palms and casuarinas, and nursery
gardens, all producing revenue to keep
up the beautiful lawns and flower beds
which make so delightful a setting to
Adyar life. In the midst of the estate
is the famous Banyan Tree, perhaps the
finest Banyan in the world, under whose
umbrageous branches Dr. Besant and
other Theosophical leaders have deliv­
ered their finest Convention addresses.
A Tree with a personality if ever there
was one !
Dr. Besant published a vision of
Adyar in which she saw it as “ one of
the great religious centres of the world.”
In another place she wrote: ‘ *The
place of Adyar in the history of The
Theosophical Society is unique, and
centuries hence it will still be the
spiritual centre of The Society.” Dr.
Arundale dreams of “ a glorious
Adyar, veritable Flaming Centre . . .
exercising an influence recognized and
appreciated throughout the world” —
an Adyar become fit for the residence
of a Master-President.
The unique features of Adyar may
thus be summarized : it is the greatest
spiritual centre in the world ; the great­
est Theosophists have left an indelible
mark upon it ; it is a great channel be­
tween East and West.
DEPARTMENTAL ACTIVITIES
To serve the needs of the residents
the estate has its own dairy, laundry,
and engineering department. Other
departmental activities are :

THE ADYAR LIBRARY
The Adyar Library attained its Golden
Jubilee on the 29th December 1935 in
the midst of Convention. It was in­
augurated during the tenth Convention
of 1885. The Library possesses today
56,000 volumes in two sections, eastern
and western. The eastern section con­
tains 10,000 volumes of Oriental manu­
scripts and 11,000 printed volumes, and
the western section 35,000 volumes.
The Adyar Library, though not
replete as to modern literature, is re­
cognized by scholars as one of the most
important in the world, particularly in
its eastern section. On 1st January 1936
an Adyar Library Association was
formed with Dr. G. S. Arundale as
President, to extend its world-wide
influence as a scholarly and cultural
centre. In February 1937 the Association
commences publication of a quarterly
journal.

martyrdom of Giordano Bruno, 1600—all
on February 17th. On this day homage
is paid to The Society’s leaders, and
donations are made to the Adyar Fund
foç International Headquarters.
INTERNATIONAL ACADEMY
OF THE ARTS .
Founded January 6, 1936 at Adyar.'
Objects : 1. To emphasize the essential
unity of all true art. 2. To work for
the recognition of the Arts as inherent
in effective individual, national and
religious growth. The Academy is a
physical expression and focus of the
new movement in The Theosophical
Society to interpret and express Theos­
ophy as Beauty. Under the auspices
of the Academy, Shrimati Rukmini Devi
in 1936 gave several successful Dance
Recitals in Madras and Adyar which
were welcomed by the Press as inaugu­
rating a new era in Indian Art. The
idealism of the Academy was adequately
expressed by Shrimati Rukmini Devi
(President) during her European tour,
1936, in a lecture entitled “ The Message
of Beauty to Civilization.” A teaching
section has been formed at the Besant
Memorial School to give intensive train­
ing in the arts of South Indian Dancing
and Music.
Others interested in the Academy are
Arun(fele (Hon. President), l?r,
Cousins (Vice-President) and Mr. Jina-
r&jadasa; Secretary Mr. R. Krishna-
murti, AdyafT*“"' ' ' ......................
^THE BESANT MEMORIAL
SCHOOL
The Besant Memorial School, Adyar,
is an experiment in Theosophical educa­
tion, and the nucleus of a College and
•28 T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
. a University of the future. Established
ill 1934, it embodies and perpetuates the
Ideals of Dr. Besant in education. Envi­
saging a Besant University near Adyar,
Dr. Arundale has said: “ The most
splendid memorial that can possibly be :
far better than any statues, far better
than any scholarship, far better than any
other memorial must there be a great
educational centre in which the young
citizens of India may become great
citizens and some of those perhaps great
leaders to help India onwards. ’ ' •
The School is administered by a
Trust of which Dr. Arundale is the
President. The education is from the
kindergarten up to the University. *
Teachers number 20, and scholars 104,
all “ hand-picked.” The school is
-officially recognized by the Educational
Department of the Madras Presidency
and receives Government grant. The
District Educational Officer has re­
ported (September 1936) : “ This is not
a mere High School in the ordinary
sense of the term. Here all the highest
ideals of education and training are put
into operation by men and women of
high intellect and culture, of course,
now compelled to limit the scope of
their ideals by the needs of a Public
Examination ; the staff as a whole are
trying to combine these two forces quite
successfully. **
The school has a Court of Honour,
numbering eight, who are setting an
example in self-government and a tradi­
tion for honour, justice and kindliness.
Headmaster, Mr. K. Shankara Menon,
M.A.
THE WORLD CAMPAIGN FUND
A ¿100,000 World Theosophy Cam­
paign Fund (“ World Fund ” for short)
has been proposed by Mr. Peter Free­
man, General Secretary for Wales.
Purposes:
1. To carry on the work of The
Theosophical Society for the next forty
years until the centenary in 1975.
2. To support: The Seven-Year Plan,
International Theosophical propaganda,
developments at Adyar, the International
Centre at fteneva.
3. To help to secure a Membership
of 100,000 F.T.S. throughout the world.
4. To provide travelling and other
necessary expenses for the President and
other officers and workers for The
Society.
5. To provide pensions for Theo­
sophical workers who have given a life’s
service for The Society.
Mr. Freeman proposes that an effort
should be made to complete the Fund
by 1941, when the next Presidential
election takes place. The name of every
subscriber to be recorded on a Centenary
Roll of Honour af Adyar.
In the meantime the President has
established the Faithful Service Fund
to provide for Theosophical workers
who have given the best of their lives
on subsistence allowances to the Theo­
sophical Movement. The Fund is re­
gistered under the Charitable Societies
Act. The Trustees are Mr. C. Jinaraja-
dasa, Mr. N. Sri Ram and Dr. G. S.
Arundale. Contributions may be made
to the Treasurer of the Faithful Service
Fund, Adyar.
THE HEAVEN OF ADTAR
Adyar is a Heaven in this outer world of ours, with many of the features
characteristic of the Heaven-worlds so beautifully described to us in our Theo­
sophical literature. Adyar is a reflection of its Inner Counterpart, of which many
have heard and which a few know. To this Inner Counterpart Adyar lives in
perfect adjustment, receiving and sending forth that Rhythm whereby all living
things move ever onwards to their splendid destiny.—G. S. Arundale in
A Guide to Adyar.

HISTORY OF THE THEOSOPHICAX
SOCIETY
Founding in America
T he organization which became
The Theosophical Society may be
said to have begun when Col.
H. S. Olcott, an investigator into
the phenomena of spiritualism,
met Madame Blavatsky at Eddy’s
farm, Chittenden, U.S.A., in 1874.
Such phenomena had taken place
for years, yet no rational explana­
tion of them had been forthcom­
ing, nor had they led to a deeper
insight into life’s problems. H.P.
Blavatsky offered explanations
and demonstrated her ability to
produce the phenomena herself.
Such was the interest aroused that
at a meeting held in New York
on 7th September 1875, Col.
Olcott suggested the organization
of a Society and sixteen names
were handed in. The title The
Theosophical Society was resolved
upon, the present seal adopted,
and an inaugural address given by
Col. Olcott on 17th November.
No mention of the word “ brother­
hood ” is found in the first pub­
lished Objects of The Society, but
in 1878 the Rules were amplified,
mentioning “ the universal brother­
hood of the human race,” and
dividing The Society into three
sections. Entering as a Fellow,
in the third section, a member
who became “ able to regard all
men as equally brethren ” might
pass into the second section. The
first section was reserved for
“ Initiates in Esoteric Science.”
Isis ITfiveiled ^1877) helped to
arouse interest in The Society and
men of the calibre of Alfred
Russell Wallace, F.R.S., William
Crookes, F.R.S., Thomas A.
Edison, and Camille Flammarion
joined. •
Founders Settle in India
* For a short time The Society
joined hands with the Arya
Samaj, a movement to bring
about a purer form of Hinduism ;
but it was soon felt that the
former, being unsectarian, could
not identify itself with any body
having purely sectarian aims.
Late in 1878, the Founders left
New York for Bombay, and after
their arrival in India great activity
set in. The Theosophist was
founded in 1879, and the First Con­
vention held. Mr. A. P. Sinjiett,
Editor of The Pioneer (Allahabad)
then India’s foremost paper, joined
The Society, together with Mrs.
Sinnett. In 1880 the Founders
visited Ceylon and aroused the
Buddhists. In 1881 Col. Olcott
published his famous Buddhist
Catechism, and founded a Bud­
dhist Educational Association. The
phenomena which H .P.B. still pro­
duced stimulated interest and
inquiry.
In lg§2 the Adyar estate was
acquired, and the Founders arrived
there on December 19th. The
36
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 37
? next year Mr. Sinnett, after close
\study of the Theosophic philo-
j sophy, returned to London, found-
ed the London Lodge, and
l published Tj^e Occult Wojrld and
Esoteric Buddhispt. About 1884
Mr. t . W . Leadbeater met the
Founders in Europe and later
accompanied H. P. Blavatsky on
her return journey to Adyar. This
, same year, during the absence of
the Founders, an attack upon
The Society was led by certain
‘ C h r i s t i a n ” missionaries of
Madras* who published a series of
forged letters, purporting to have
been addressed by H.P.B. to a
Madame Coulomb, ex-housekeeper
at Adyar. Hearing of these letters,
the Society for Psychical Re­
search,London, sent out a young
Australian^ named Hodgson to
investigate. His .report, made
without any previous reference to
H .P.B., was of an ex parte
character, hostile, partial, com­
pletely credulous and based on
insufficient knowledge. H.P.B.
left India in 1885 and seftTeTm
Wui^burg”
"fo work at The Secret
Doctrine; Col. Olcott carrying
on his organizing work in the
East.
Enter Annie Besant
In 1887, H. P. Blavatsky was
persuaded to visit London, where
she was assisted in bringing out
i? the first two volumes of The
Secret Doctrine in 1889. Having
reviewed the book, Mrs. Besant
well known as a Social Reformer
and Freethinker, sought out
H .P.B. and joined The Society.
She was soon lecturing and writ­
ing on * Theosophy, abandoning
completely the materialistic philo­
sophy she had held until then.
After writing The Key to Theo­
sophy and The Voice of the
Silence, and leaving instructions
for the revision of The Secret
Doctrine, H.P.B. left her body on
8th May 1 8 9 1 7 ^ ''
~ In 1893, Mrs. Besant was
warmly welcomed in India and
lectured at the Annual Convention*
and at every subsequent Conven­
tion until 1907, excepting 1897.
From 1893 onwards the harmony
of The Theosophical Society was
disturbed by the giving out of
“ messages ” of doubtful authentic­
ity by Mr. W . Q. Judge, General
Secretary, U.S.A. 1886— 1895,
culminating in the secession in
1895 of the bulk of the U.S.A.
Lodges. The next decade was
one of peaceful, steady growth*
Col. Olcott travelling far and
wide, and Mrs. Besant lecturing.
In 1906, The Society suddenly
plunged into an acute crisis
certain Fellows in the U.S.A.
took exception to personal advice-
in regard to sex difficulties given
by Mr. Leadbeater in a few in­
dividual cases— advice which was
twenty years ahead of his day
and is approved by modem
psychologists— they demanded his
resignation from The Society, and
he resigned. A calmer review
of the matter led to his reinstate­
ment (1908) and the replacement
of the American Executive in
1907. Late in 1906, Col. Olcott
met with an accident, and in
. 38 T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L YEA R BOOK, 1937
February 1907* he passed (
^ § y ,
after nominating Mrs. Besant his
successor as President, one of the
rules of The Society giving him
4t the right of nominating his
successor, subject to the ratifica­
tion of T^e Society.” The Presi­
dent-Founder was a great-hearted
man, with a unique gift for weld­
ing the members of the many
races and creeds into a united
whole.
A New Era Begins
Mrs. Besant’s term as Presi­
dent opened stormily. Though
dissenting from the advice given
by Mr. Leadbeater, to which re­
ference has been made, she upheld
his purity of life. Opponents
found in the word “ appoint,”
used unofficially by Col. Olcott in
regard to his successor, in his
letters to the General Secretaries,
an opportunity for disapproval;
although Col. Olcott had used the
word ‘ nominate ” in his official
communications. Mrs. Besant was
elected President by an over­
whelming majority. With her a
new era began. She spoke openly,
as she had promised H.P.B., of
her occult relation to the Master,
and at the same time gave a lead
in making Theosophy practical,
urging members to Theosophize
various fields of reform— religious,
social, economic, political. The
various lines adopted by members
under her leadership are grouped
under the Theosophical Order of
Service, which she instituted in
1908. As a result, the Section
headed “ Subsidiary Activities ”
then appeared for the first time
in the Convention Report, the
number of such activities growing
steadily from ye^r to year.
Krishnamurti
In i 908, Mrs. Besant publicly
announced the coming of a World
Teacher in the near future, and
in 1911 the Order of the Star in
the East« was organized to group
together those who wished to
prepare for it. In 1912, the father
of J. Krishnamurti, Head of the
Order, was persuaded to bring a
suit for the restitution of his sons
against Mrs. Besant, to whose
care he had entrusted them in
1909. In the final appeal to the
Privy Council in London, she
won the case on her own brief.
Opponents of Theosophy inMadras
instigated various attacks on Mrs.
Besant. The publicity gained by
these untrue charges aroused wide
interest, and brought into The
Society in India a larger number
of members than at any previous
time.
The formation of the Order of
the Star in the East had a further
repercussion in the disruption of
the German Section. Dx*. Rudolf
Steiner, a man of great ability
and of deeply philosophical
and mystical temperament, who
had done so much to vitalize the
Section, ruled, as General Sec­
retary, that no member of the
Order of the Star in the East
could remain a member of the
German Section. This limitation
of the liberty of Fellows being
unconstitutional, the Charter was
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y EA R BOOK, 1937 39
cancelled. Fourteen Lodges out
of sixty-nine were willing to carry
on the broader tradition. These
were chartered as the National
Society in Germany.
The war of 1914-1918 made com­
munication between Headquarters
and the so-called “ enemy ” coun­
tries impossible. During the four
years of its duration the President
was unable to visit Europe ; but
from May to December 1919, she
was in England. Meanwhile she
had developed her political work
in India, made additions to the
Adyar property, and aroused great
interest in Theosophical education
in India.
First 'VSforld Congress
In 1921, the First World Con­
gress of The Society was held in
Paris, and fraternal relations be­
tween the National Societies in
those countries which had been
at war were resumed. Mr. C. W .
Leadbeater in 1914 left for a
lecturing tour in Australia, where
he attracted many who were inter­
ested in Theosophy. In Sydney
he took up his permanent resid­
ence. After some years, his work
as à Bishop of the Liberal Catholic
Church led to difficulties with cer­
tain of the most active members
of the Sydney Lodge. In 1922 the
President visited Australia, and
was obliged to cancel the Sydney
Lodge charter. The Blavatsky
Lodge emerged from the crisis.
The opening by the President on
her 75th birthday of the Brahma-
vidya Ashrama at Adyar, where
students from all over the world
could gather and study, made
1922 an important year.
One of the chief eventfe of
1923 was the Vienna Congress
of the European Federation
founded in 1903. Mr. Jinarajadasa
presided. The Congress led to a
fresh access of life and interest in
Eastern Europe.
In 1924 Dr. Besant was again
in Europe visiting England,
France, Holland and Germany.
A- public tribute to her 50 years*
activity was paid her at a great
meeting in the Queen’s Hall,
London, held in July. Messages
were received from eminent men
and women all over the world.
The meeting made it possible to
trace the influence Dr. Besant
had exercised upon men and
movements of varying kinds, all
directed to the service and en­
lightenment of humanity.
The Society’s Jubilee
1925 was the Jubilee Year of
The Society, whose rapid growth
from the small beginning in New
York in 1875 is illustrated by
the following data: Number of
National Societies in 1925 : 41;
Number of Lodges : 1,576 ; Num­
ber of Members : 41,779 ; Num­
ber of Members who passed
through The Society in fifty years
1875-1925: 116,322. Since the
passing of the Founders, the
lectures, writings and investiga­
tions of Dr. Besant and Bishop
Leadbeater have thrown additional
light upon H .P. Blavatsky’s work,
and opened out fresh avenues of
thought and research, including,
. 40 3rTH E T H E O SO P H IC A L YEAR BOOK, 1937
in" particular, such researches as
are to be found in Occult Chernis-
f and Man : Whence, fiow and
\ Whltf&rTThe Pr-esident had the
gifF"of interesting large audiences
in her expositions of Theosophy,
and Bishop Leadbeater that of
clear, balanced descriptions of the
worlds open to his inner gaze.
At the brilliant Jubilee Congress
held at Adyar in December..1925
(the Second World Congress) the
past progress of The Society was
reviewed and plans for the future«
were formulated. It was, in parti­
cular, emphasized that there was
a vast amount of work yet to be
done, and to be undertaken by
each individual Fellow accord­
ing to his capacities and oppor­
tunities.
The next year, at a Convention
of the four British Sections, over
which Dr. Besant presided, the
following important resolution was
passed:
“ That in view of world-wide
endeavours to reinterpret the
fundamental bases of religion, this
Convention welcomes all new
expressions of religious truth from
whatever source, and urges upon
F.T.S. an open mind and a
receptive attitude towards every
declaration of such truth with a
I view to the fuller realization of
; universal brotherhood.”
t
Record Membership
The work continued to expand
during the next two years, and
in 1928 the membership returns
reached a record peak of 45,098.
Dr, Besant was re-elected for the
fourth time as President of The
Theosophical Society, and nomi-
nated Jvir. A. P. Warrington as
Vice-I^esidehfr" Tn 1929 a third
World .Congress was held in
Chicago, at which great enthu­
siasm was displayed. At Adyar,
the President, in what was almost
her last vigorous message, stressed
the danger to The Society of death
by orthodoxy, or, on the other
hand, of disruption due to party-
spirit, the result of identification
with any religious, economic,
political, or occult beliefs.
In the next three years the
President’s health began to fail,
and it was now fully realized
what a mainspring of vigour and
activity she had always been.
Economic depression had become
acute in most countries; in a
number of which there was, in
addition, much political unrest.
Doubt and controversy arose as
the result of Krishnamurti’s pro­
vocative and challenging words.
The membership returns showed
a decline, but two new Sections
were formed, one in Central South
Africa, the other in Central
America, while in the following
year the Section in the Philippine
Islands was chartered.
Dr. Arundale President
In September 1933, the Presi­
dent passedaway, to be joined in
February 1934 by her great and
loyal colleague, C. W . Lead­
beater. Mr. A. P. Warrington, the
Vice-President, temporarily as­
sumed control until arrangements
on a world-wide scale for the
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E fR BOOK, 1937 41 1
Presidential election could be com­
pleted. There were two candidates,
Dr. George S. Arundale and Mr.
Ernest W ood, the former being
elected T>y a majority of 10,779
votes. He assumed office in June
1934 for a term of seven years.
His ardent enthusiasm was im­
mediately reflected in The Society
as a whole, and resulted in the
autumn of 1935 in a Campaign
of Straight Theosophy, i.e., em­
phasis on the fundamental princi­
ples and teachings for which The
Society as a whole may be
said to stand. Every National
Society took part in this Cam­
paign.
THE JSTJEOPEAN FEDERATION
T he Federation of National Societies
of The Theosophical Society in Europe
■w
as inaugurated on 23rd July 1903, in
London, at the Annual Convention of
the British Section, The President,
Col. H. S. Olcott, became Chairman,
and Mr. Johan van Manen was elected
General Secretary.
Conferences were held yearly until
1906, when it was decided that they
should bp biennial except under special
circumstances. Thereafter they were
held at Munich (1907), Budapest (1909),
and Stockholm (1913). After the Great
War, the Congresses .were not resumed
till 1921, when the meeting coincided
with the World Congress in Paris ; at
this meeting Miss Dijkgraaf was elected
General Secretary. The Congress met
again in 1923, and in 1925 the Council
of the Federation met at Adyar, during
the Jubilee Convention. Subsequent
Congresses were held at Ommen in 1926
and 1927, Dr. Besant appointed Miss
Dijkgraaf as International Lecturer, and
the latter's tour in Southern Europe in
1927-8 renewed the interest which had
somewhat flagged. The ninth Con­
gress, held at Brussels in 1928, was well
attended, and the founding of an Inter­
national Centre at Geneva was decided
upon. A small National Societies’
Convention was held in Budapest in
1927, when Mr. Cochius was elected
General Secnitary;
Geneva (1930) saw the Congress dele­
gates received by the Civic Authorities,
the first pnblic recognition of the Con­
gress, and this recognition was repeated
in Barcelona in 1934.
Besides holding Congresses, the Fed­
eration works to form the nucleus for
the United Nations of Europe, on the
basis of Brotherhood, not of Politics.
It also tries to assist the formation of
new National Societies and sends inter­
national lecturers to the countries where
help is needed.
The General Secretaries of the Euro­
pean Federation since its inauguration
have been :
Mr. Johan van Manen (1904-1906)
Mr. A. R. Wallace (1906-1913)
Dr. J. I. Wedgwood (1913-1921)
Miss C. W. Dijkgraaf (1921-1929)
Mr. P. M. Cochius (1929- )
THE SOUTH AMERICAN FEDERATION
T he South American Federation . the second Congress held at Montevideo,
Secretary: Senor Alvaro A. Araujo,
Casilla de Correo 595, Montevideo,
Uruguay. The South American Feder­
ation was organized under the presi­
dency of the General Secretary for
Uruguay, Mrs. Julia Acevado de la
Gamma, and held its first Congress on
the 18th April, 1930, the following Sec­
tions taking part: Argentina, Peru,
Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. At the
April 1931, it was resolved to unify the
official organs of Argentina, Chile,
Uruguay and Peru into one publication
under the name of El Teosofo Sud-
American. The third Congress, post­
poned till 1933, took place at Santiago.
The fourth Congress was held at Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil, June 1934, Mr, C.
Jinarajadasa presiding. The fifth Con­
gress at Rozario, Argentina, 1935,

THEOSOPHY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
AN INCREASING MEMBERSHIP
T he decline in membership, caused
mainly by the depression, was complete­
ly overtaken in 1935, and The Theo-
sophical Society numerically is on the
upward arc. The total membership
on December 1, 1935 stood at 30,317
which showed a net gain for the year
of 572, as against a loss of 1,091 during
the previous year. The largest gains
were in the following nine Sections ;
America, England, India, Belgium,
Java, Burma, Denmark, Argentina,
Puerto Rico, which turned their minus
into a substantial plus.
The number of units within The
Theosophical Society on 31 December
1935 was as follows :
National Societies 45
Lodges ... 1,226
Federations of Lodges 4

NATIONAL SUMMARIES
The Theosophical Society is organized in the following
fifty countries, a veritable spiritual League of Nations. A
summary is given of the National Policy of each country,
its cultural activities, and its Theosophical History.
N a t i o n a l S u m m a r ie s : An attempt is made to
unfold before the reader the idealistic purpose of each
N ation: what is rights not what may be wrong with the
country. The world judges by the ephemeral shadows of
error and mistake which flicker a moment on the surface
of Reality and are gone. The Theosophist considers rather
the Right, the Real and the Enduring.
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y EA R BOOK, 1937 49,
B io g r a p h ie s : The story of Theosophy in each
country is inseparable from the biographies of its pioneer
and Section leaders. Limitations of space, however, pro­
hibit repetition, and the reader is referred to the list of
General Secretaries On p. 43, et s e q and the personal story
of each in “ W ho’s W ho.” Membership figures are to be
found on pp. 47-8. A list of Books of the Year in all
countries is given under “ Theosophy’s Classic Literature.”
AMERICA, CENTRAL
The Central America Section operates
in the Republics of Honduras, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa
Rica, and Colombia, with Headquarters
in Costa Rica. (Panama is under the
U. S. A. Section.)
Presidents of Republics:
COSTA R IC A : Don Leon Cortes,
8 Mar. 1936-.
HONDURAS : Dr. Tiburcio Carias-
Andino,’ ! Feb. 1933-.
GUATEMALA : General Jorge Ubico,
14 Feb. 1931-1943.
EL SALVADOR : pen. Maximiliano
Martinez, F. T. S., 1932-5, 1935-9.
NICARAGUA: Don Carlos Brenes
Jarquin, June, 1936. ,
COLOM BIA: Don Alfonso López,
7 Aug. 1934-8.
The five Central American Republics
signed 12 April 1934 a Convention for
Peace amongst themselves.
National Summary:
Beauty, and its expression through
Art, is the keynote of Central American
life : beauty of natural surroundings,
volcanic mountains, green and gold
plains with tropical verdure ; beauty of
architecture and city planning ; beauty
in the relics of ancient Indian civiliza­
tions. Even the humblest peasant
decorates his ox-cart with colour and
design.
Colombia on 12 November 1932 gave
married women full control of their
property and a share of that acquired
jointly after marriage.
Nicaragua is courageously rebuilding
its capital, Managua, almost totally
destroyed 31 March 1931 by earthquake.
An insurrection caused the abdication
of the former President in favour of
Ddn Brenes Jarquin, a prominent
Liberal.
Guatemala has promulgated im­
portant legislation, providing for a new
Penal Code, and classifying as crimes
veneral contagion and usury. Road
construction is proceeding apace. Great
tracts of land are being granted to rural
families, together with agricultural im­
plements, wel! selected seeds, and
initial funds. The State Bank is con­
structing and selling modern houses to
labourers on long-term credit. Amatitlan
Lake is being made a garden spot.
El Salvador again elected General
Maximiliano Martinez, an active worker
in The Theosophical Society, to serve
as President of the Republic until 1939.
Costa Rica, under its new President.
Don Leon Cortes, looks for new orien­
tation not only in all departments of
State, but in the country as a whole.
In Costa Rica capital punishment cannot
be inflicted.
Cultural Activities:
In all these Republics, great atten­
tion is paid to education. In Costa Rica,
El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras,
elementary education is free and com­
pulsory. In Costa Rica, the departments
which receive most attention are Educa­
tion and Public W orks; latest educa­
tional methods are followed, and there
is an average of one school and four
teachers for every hundred children.
In Guatemala plantation owners are
required by law to furnish schools for
over ten children. Colombia Jaas free
but not compulsory education, tut since
1934 the law requires that at least 10%
50 T H E T H E O S O P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
of State revenue must be demoted to
education. Among the oldest of the
fine universities in. Central America are
Colombia’s University of Bogota, found­
ed 1572, and the University of Guate­
mala, 1678. Nicaragua in 1934 opened
her schools which had been closed since
1931 owing to the financial depletion
caused by the earthquake.
The dominant religion in all these
countries is Roman Catholic, and in
Costa Rica, Honduras, and Colombia
Catholicism is the State religion. How­
ever, there is freedom of thought and
belief and a guarantee of individual
liberty. *
Beautiful parks and buildings stud the*
broad streets of San José, the capital city
of Costa Rica. Proud are the Costa
Ricans of their National Theatre with
its fine statues, precious wood parquetry
floors, painted ceilings, and carved, gold-
leaf-covered walls ; of the Cathedral
facing Central Park ; of the Temple of
Music in Morazan Park ; and other
cultural centres. Exhibitions of sculp­
ture and painting show appreciation for
national artistic archievement.
One of many interesting Festivals is
that of the Birds, early in November,
when hundreds of birds are set free by
children, followed by plays representing
scenes from bird life.
Craftsmanship is stimulated by dis­
plays of home-made toys, and the
beauties of embroidery and tapestry
done in the colours and designs of the
vases of the ancient Indian tribes.
There is the hope of establishing in the
near future an Institute of Arts and
Crafts.
Among the features of Central Ameri­
can artistic life are the Expositions held
in Costa Rica (one for plastic arts and
one for painting and sculpture) at which
the various countries exhibit annually.
There are two tendencies in painting :
classical and modernist. One of the
leading exponents of the former is Don
Tomas Povedano, father of Theosophy
in Central America. A number of young
enthusiasts have formed the “ Circle of
Friends of Art ’’ for its popularization
through lectures, expositions, and pub­
lication of artistic activities.
Many of the artists, architects, and
musicians of Central America are in­
ternationally known. Composers of
great strength are coming forward and
their works for band, orchestra, etc.,
are numerous. The President of Guate­
mala, General don Jorge Ubico, to
spread musical culture among the
masses, ordered the organization of a
Progressive Orchestra, composed of 35
professors under the leadership of the
celebrated director, José Casteneda.
This Orchestra gives radio concerts and
makes circuit tours. Academies of
Music and Art, museums, and other
stimuli to artistic endeavour, are readily
available in Central America for the
young aspirant to a Fine Arts education.
A musical outlet is found by the peasant­
ry through guitar, accordion, and native
instruments.
In the field of Archaeology, the
famous Copan ruins of Honduras, men­
tioned in Isis Unveiled, are being
restored through the joint co-operation
of the Carnegie Institute and the
Government. In the vicinity of Guate­
mala’s capital, «very ancient Indian
tombs have been unearthed ; in fact the
whole of Central America is a mine for
ancient Indian art.
A great wave of creative literary
activity has released a flood of books,
both prose and poetry, in every depart­
ment of human endeavour : science,
psychology, public economy, law, edu­
cation, history, biography, philology,
philosophy, religion, art, music, etc.,
In Guatemala the National Printing
Press, at the expense of the State,
prints many literary and scientific works
of merit. The percentage of periodical
publications is high.
In science should be particularly
noted the recent discoveries in glandu­
lar-endocrine research and therapy
through a study of sera and precipitins,
made by Dr. Picado of Costa Rica.
El Salvador is notable for research
on tropical sicknesses : the famous
‘ ‘ Sleeping Sickness ’ ’ germ was dis­
covered by Dr. Juan Segovia. Engineer
Isaias Araujo, Salvadorean delegate
to the Oceanographic Ibero-American
Conference, held in Madrid, April
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L YEAR BOOK, 1937 51
1935, presented the Electro-Magnetic
Theory of the Cold Sun. His treatise
contains an analysis of a new universe
structure and is being studied with inter­
est by other scientists.
Many famous experiniental stations in
Central America are solving the problems
of industrial and ornamental agriculture.
Theosophy in Central America :
General Secretary : Miss Esther de
Mezerville, 1933-7 ; Vice-Pres. : Julio
Acosta ; Sec. : José B. Acuna ; Treas. :
José Monturiol ; Other members of Exe­
cutive Council: Miss Lydia Fernández,
Mariano L. Coronado, José Coronado,
and the Presidents of all Section Lodges.
The Headquarters is located in the
beautiful building and spacious garden,
belonging to Virya Lodge.
History : The first Lodge recorded in
Central America was chartered in 1894
f in Bluefields, Nicaragua, as the Central
American Theosophical Society, with
Simon A. Howard and Joseph P. Moody
as President and Secretary, and was
' attached to the American Section. The
Lodge was short-lived, but made its
mark on Nicaraguan thought. The next
mention of Theosophical activity is that
of Señor Tomas Povedano, eminent
artist, who founded. Costa Rica’s first
Lodge, Virya, on 1st June 1904, under
the Cuban Section. Slowly, through
Señor Povedano’s efforts, and the efforts
of the Cuban Section to which these
countries were originally attached,
Theosophy spread into other Central
American countries—Salvador, Nicara­
gua, Guatemala, and Honduras, and
even into Colombia. In 1927, a
Presidential Agency was formed for
Central America and Colombia under
José B. Acuña and a monthly review
Virya started. 12 May 1929, Sefior
Mariano *L. Coronado was installed by
Mr. Jinarajadasa, as the newly con­
stituted Section’s first General Secretary.
Propaganda: While the economic
depression reduced membership, in­
terest in Theosophy remained as keen
as ever and a fresh wave of life and
optimism is today sweeping the Lodges.
The Section took advantage of the
Straight Theosophy (1935) and “ There
Is a Plan ” (1936) Campaigns, translating
all the material into Spanish for Lodge
work.
A lecture tour was made by Senor
Acuna to the Colombian Lodges in
1935. In 1929 and 1934 the Section
was visited by Mr. Jinarajadasa, who
addressed large audiences in the National
Theatre, Costa Rica, and aroused great
enthusiasm for Theosophy. The attempts
made by orthodoxy to forbid attendance
stimulated rather than deterred, and
huge crowds were attracted. Lodgeshave
been active in work for prisoners and
Indians, a Children’s Park movement, a
Theosophical School, The Youth Move­
ment, the prohibition of importation of
immoral literature, and other welfare
activities.
Theosophical ideals and wisdom are
broadcast from a powerful wireless
station, belonging to Luz de Valle Lodge,
Colombia.
The Section takes part in the cultural
life of the country, several of the
members being internationally known
as artists. Headquarters constitutes
itself as an appreciative receiving
station of books, works of art, and
other cultural achievements of members.
Several of the Lodges publish Theo­
sophical bulletins or journals.
AMERICA (UNITED STATES)
President of Bepublic : Franklin
Delano Roosevelt, re-elected November,
1936, to hold office March 1937-41.
National Summary :
* The keynote : 44The Spirit of the
I Quest of the New Age, and of giving
; spiritual values to material things.”
J {George S. Annidale).
A new social order is fighting its way
into being against the great odds of
determined and forceful capitalistic
opposition. President Roosevelt took
office during the period of deepest
financial depression. The banking
structure was on the point of collapse
through huge withdrawals of deposits ;
T H E T H E O S O P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
52
the small investors deprived of income
and the great mass of unemployed were
unable to spend ; those who had small
reserves, fearful 'of the future, were
hoarding, and many of the very wealthy
were converting securities into gold or
foreign investments. The case of the
young was tragic : thousands emerging
from school with no prospect of employ­
ment.
Given the power of emergency dicta­
torship, offered every assistance by a
thoroughly frightened Congress, and
even implorpd by banking and other
capitalistic interests to save the situa­
tion, President Roosevelt, counselled
by a chosen group of trained economists, <
known as his 4
1Brain Trust,” inaugu­
rated a series * of decisive measures
under, the name of the “ New Deals ”
which restored public confidence and
brought the country back to normality.
Secretary Henry A. Wallace summarizes
the New Deal as follows :
“ (1) A job for everyone who wants
one. (2) Wages high enough to leave no
one in serious want. (3) Hours of labour
short enough to give everyone time
to enjoy life. (4) Adequate insurance
against unemployment and old age. (5)
Comfortable housing at moderate cost
for all. (6) Sufficient planned utilization
of the land and other natural resources
so that unnecessary depletion by
erosion and similar processes will be
avoided. (7) Maintenance of such demo­
cratic institutions as free speech, free
criticism and free conscience.
“ In brief, the New Deal places
human rights above property rights and
aims to modify special privilege for the
few to the extent that such modification
will aid in providing economic security
for the many. '’
These decisive measures, are of
the new order of co-operation and pro­
tection rather than the old order of
cut-throat competition and unmerciful
exploitation. When, therefore, the
capitalistic interests began to breathe
again with relief, the immediate danger
over, an uproar was made, protesting
and abusing the people’s servant.
The people, however, have had a taste
bf Government planning for their social
security through the abolition of child,
labour; old age, unemployment and
health protection ; regulation of maxi­
mum working hours and minimum
wages; Government employment on
huge public projects ; loans made to
property owners for repairs and improve­
ments, and to prevent foreclosures;
guarantee of bank deposits; banking
and stock-exchange regulation. Even
business itself under industrial codes has
enjoyed a freedom from unfair competi­
tion which,has contributed materially to
its rehabilitation. Agriculture has been
salvaged. It is doubtful whether even
the annulment, as unconstitutional, of
some of these measures by a conservat­
ive Supreme Court will ever force the
people back to the old competitive
system. The overwhelming majority of
votes by which President Roosevelt was
re-elected in 1936 demonstrated the
people’s confidence in “ The New
Deal,” and his plans for the future.
In the world sphere the majority of
the people, egged on by financial in­
terests, favour the policy of isolation. On
the other hand non-official interest is
taken in world conferences, particularly
for disarmament or limitation of arms,
and economic adjustment; and there
is a large internationally-minded minor­
ity who are hoping that America will
yet take her place officially in the
League of Nations. A decided step was
taken when the President renounced the
country’s right, as a neutral, to trade
with belligerent nations, declaring that
he would ‘ ‘ insure that no act of the
United States helped to promote war.”
This he calls the policy of the “ good
neighbour.”
Cultural Activities:
America has not only given the world
many great scientists and artists, but hasj
for years been the Mecca for world-re­
nowned scientists^d ^ltlSts, driven out
of their own countries by political up-|
heavals As a consequence its universities, j

The standard of education is high :
college preparatory schools are free ;
there are many State universities, and
postgraduate courses are so readily
available to young people tjjat it is not
unusual for the Ph.D. degree to be
granted to promising young persons of
twenty-four. As original research is
the basis for the M.A. degree, as well
as the Ph.D., this is obviously one
factor in the stimulation of research ;
the other great factor being the highly
developed technical laboratories.
The newer education has two object­
ives : Adjustment and Creative Ex­
pression. Classes are being held in
junior ¿oHegesl'universities,and adult
night schools, on “ “‘How to get along
Wrtlr^FoIEs7^~a6 it is expressed in the
junior schools ; mentaj hygiene is taught
to the maladjusted. Special children’s
courts study rather than “ try ”
young offenders. Among the more obvi­
ous ways of stimulating creative ex­
pression are the competitions for
original works, such as the Guggenheim
awards in the Fine Arts ; the Pulitzer
Prizes in journalism ; the hearings and
i
exhibitions of Contemporary Art, such
as that at Harvard in 1936, at which
the poem Immanence by Mrs. Lawrence
Bull, F.T.S. was sung. A wave of
creative beauty in art and music is
sweeping the country. We find
older and more seasoned composers
vying with young men hardly out of the
class room. Some of these younger
men are frankly experimental and
a-tonal in their concepts, but chaos
comes before cosmos. On the other
hand such men as John Alden Carpen­
ter, Leo Sowerby, Deems Taylor,
Howard Hanson, Eric DeLamarter,
Daniel Gregory Manson are producing
less arrantly modern works but perhaps
more representative of American culture
at its best. The radio has been a
powerful, influence in tuning people in.
to fine music ; even the inevitable Jazz,
with its challenging rhythms, though
now demoralizing in its effect, may be
the precursor of a future *
*folk-song.”
The Government has recognized art
as a necessary function of life and the
Public Works Administration, Arts
Projects Division, is awarding contracts
for the embellishment of Federal builds
ings in many cities. Art is being taken
away from the collector and given to-
the people. City Planning is replacing
the haphazard cowpath type of town
with beauty in even the smaller villages.
The larger cities are zoning, tearing
down slums, and in general rebuilding
in line with the new cult of Beauty.
Factories, railway stations, public utili­
ties in particular show the influence o f
the new bridging movement to give
spiritual values to material obiects.
Claude Bragdon, F.T.S. and architect,
of New York, has contributed his ideal­
ism to the new art movement.
T h eosoph y in the U nited States :
Sidney A. Cook is in his third term,
1936-9, as General Secretary or National
President of ‘‘ The Theosophical Society
in America.” Vice-Pres., Norman
JPearson. Five other Board members*
also are elected every three years by
direct ballot. The National Secretary,
Miss Etha Snodgrass, and other national
officers are Presidential appointees.
History : The story of Theosophy in
America from 1875 to 1878 is identical
with that of The Theosophical Society
and its Founders. In January, 1879, en
route to India, the President-Founder
appointed "Major-General Abn^TJdSbJe
“tils representative in the United
States, with William Q. Judge as Secre­
tary. The
^frOm New York to Bombay caused an al*
most complete cessation of activities in
the United States. With the exception
of an application for a charter for a
Lodge in Los Angeles in April, 1879,
and one in Rochester in 1882, no
activity was reported until 1883, when
the Pioneer Lodge of St. Louis was
formed May 5th, and in December
a few members gathered round
Mr. Judge in New York and were
T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
54
-chartered as the ‘' Aryan Thepsophical
Society.” From then the movement
,grew steadily. America served as the
laboratory in which various methods of
national organization were tried by the
President-Founder. First the Presi­
dential agency, still used in opening up
new countries. Then a Board of
Control was instituted 13 May 1884,
.and later dissolved as unsatisfactory.
On 30 October 1886, the autonomous but
•closely linked to Headquarters Section
idea was instituted, and has been since
-adopted as ihe policy of The Society in
every country with more than seven
Bodges.
A tremendous impetus was given to*
Theosophy in America at The first
World Parliament of Religions held in
•Chicago in 1893, one of its sessions
.being devoted to the presentation of
Theosophy by Mrs, Besant and dele­
gates from other countries.
Wm. Q. Judge served as the first
<
T
(§‘nefarSecret^ry until 1895, as well as
Vice-President of the international
-Society, but owing to serious differences
«(refer to Old Diary Leaves, 5th Series)
he seceded from The Society with the
majority of the 102 U. S. A. Lodges.
.Shortly after Mr. Judge’s death in 1896,
•
asecession from the secession took place,
and that movement split up into several
minor branches and offshoots, losing
the cohesion which devotion to a strong
personality had maintained.
A nucleus of fourteen loyal Lodges
under the able leadership of Alexander
Fullerton, and stimulated by the lecture
.tours of Countess Wachtmeister and
Mrs. Besant, 1896 and 1897, drew
around itself many more Lodges and
members, and a strong American
Section with Headquarters in New York
was re-established.
Major and minor upheavals and
turmoils seemed to make only inappreci­
able effect upon the steady progress of
the Section. In the early years, it
received impetus from lecture tours of
great Theosophists: The President,
Founder, 1901 and 1906 ; C. W. Lead-
n
l903, 1905 ; Mrs. Besant, 1907-
C. Jinarajadasa assisted the
m Society in the crisis of 1906
and several subsequent years. From 1909
to the twenties, it was dependent more
particularly on its strong Section
leaders, its General Secretaries and
other stalwarts. The twenties and
thirties have again marked a renais­
sance of life with many visits from
Dr. Besant, Dr. Arundale and Shrimatj^
Rukmini Devi, and Mr. Jinarajadasa.
The Third World Congress, held in
Chicago in 1929, marked another epoch
in Section history.
Each General Secretary contributed
substantially to the progress of Theos­
ophy in America: Wm. Q. Judge,
1886-95, laid the foundations of Theos-
ophical interest in the major cities;
Alexander Fullerton, 1895-1907, rebuilt
the Section in its most difficult period.
The great scientist-surgeon, Dr. Weller
Van Hook, 1907-12, stimulated its
growth in the central area, moving the
national headquarters to Chicago. Albert
J?. Warrington, 1912-20, brought in a
phase of cultural and spiritual develop­
ment in the beautiful garden ashrama,
“ Krotona,” located in the Hollywood ,
hills of California^ The vision of L. W.
Rogers, 1920-31, established “ Olcott,”
the fine Headquarters, at Wheaton,
thirty miles west of Chicago, whose
cornerstone was laid with full Masonic
rites, 29 August 1926, by Dr. Annie
Besant, and whose 25-acre estate was
soon thereafter enriched by a 250,000-
dollar building. Sidney A. Cook, 1931— ,
has contributed a rare combination of
practical business ability and* spiritual
prescience, and is welding together all
parts of this country of magnificent
distances into a closely knit and well-
integrated working organization for the
Masters’ Service.
Propaganda : The American himself
is in a state of transition. Within him
is coming to birth the intuitional princi­
ple through mind and feeling. The
precursor of this intuition is evidenced
in a certain “ joining ” tendency. This
peculiar feature of American emotional
life, the expression of human solidarity
in feeling, gives rise to organizations
innumerable. In the world of the mind,
this emergence of intuition is indicated
by a ready acceptance of the truths of
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 55
Theosophy, without a too detailed in­
quiry or analysis ; in other words, a
direct “ knowing ” or Mhunch.” Ameri­
can children often distress teachers
by their impatience with long explana­
tions of what to them seem obvious
truths. To this new type Theosophy is
being presented, as well as to the
Nation’s finest minds and deepest
thinkers.
The policy of the Section Administra­
tion is not only propaganda to obtain
members, but a wise project to hold
them.
The Greater America Plan, inaugu­
rated in 1933, is a sustained effort to
unify the Section in deep and unbreak­
able bonds of understanding and sym­
pathy ; to develop the innate capacities
of the individual member, young and
old, for leadership and cultural expres­
sion ; and to put forth Theosophy with a
special cultural appeal to the finest
artistic, scientific, and philosophical
minds. ; Dr. Pieter K. Roest, a Pro­
fessor of Sociology, and Miss Anita
Henkel, welfare worker, were drafted
to put the Plan into operation, and with
the assistance of Dr. Pickett and other
field workers, it has been an ever-in­
creasing success for, the revivification
of the Section.
Direct contact is also maintained with
the Lodges through The American
Theosophist and personal letters from
the President. The annual Conventions
and Summer Schools are a continuous
source of inspiration.
Correspondence Courses have been „
found of great value to the inquirer and
student, and a new series has been
recently issued by Mrs. Simons.
The lecture tours of L. W. Rogers,
Fritz Kunz, and Dr. Roest, together
with the distribution of many propa­
ganda leaflets, are spreading Theosophy
over the Section. Particularly success­
ful is Mr. Kunz’s Visual Education
Scheme prepared by the Research
Setninars (Room 203, 9 East Hoth St.,
New York), and the ‘ ‘ reelslides ’ ‘ of
Mr. Norman Pearson.
A project is on foot to establish a
cultural and artistic centre at “ Olcott.”
This should attract those interested in
the Beauty aspect of the Divine Life.
Under the stimulus of Dr. Arundale
and Shrimati Rukmim Devi, there
has arîsert'-’àtr American Federation of
Young Theosophists, which is actively
spreading Theosophy among America's
youth.
The 1936 Convention, by discussing
the central subject of Justice in relation
to Races, Motherhood, Youth, Art, etc.,
was a preparation for the Geneva World
Congress, at which the Section was well
represented.
ABGENTINA

N ational Sum m ary :
Argentina may be viewed as a great
melting-pot from which is emerging a
new type of humanity, through a mixture
of different races from all parts of the
world. The tendency of the Administra­
tion is towards Conservatism though
extensive modifications of the Constitu­
tion have been discussed since 1934.
An extensive public works programme
was begun in April 1936 for public
buildings, highways, railway reconstruc­
tion and improvement. Argentina has
taken many steps to establish a friendly
entente with Brazil and other Latin-
American States, and has been host to
Pan-American conferences.
Cultural A c tiv itie s :
The civilization is modern, centering
around the capital Buenos Aires, a city
with fine public buildings and housing
two and a half million inhabitants. The
greatest expression of Art at the moment
is in Architecture. A new tendency
towards light and air marks the con­
struction of new buildings—they are
distinguished by simple beautiful lines.
There is no State religion, though the
Roman Catholic religion is supported
by the State, and its President and Vice-
President must be Roman Catholics.
All other creeds are tolerated and
3(5 T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
freedom of conscience prevails. Primary
education is free, secular, and compul­
sory between 6 and 14 years. Illiteracy
decreased 13% from 1916 to 1930. 24%
v
of the total expenditures of 1932 went
for education with a tenth of that
amount spent on universities.
Theosophy in Argentina :
Generalv Secretary, Señor Raul Angel
Wyngaard, and a General Council,
elected a three-year term by the
delegate! Assembled at Convention.
History : The Theosophical move­
ment in South America was started in
the Argentine Republic by Commandant
Don Federico Fernandez a'nd
Signora Antonia Martinez Royo, who4
*
founded 7 January 1893 in Buenos
Aires the first Theosophical Lodge, and
a Semi-monthly review under the name
of Luz (Light). The members of this
Lodge were enthusiastic and studious
investigators who have since occupied
prominent positions in Argentine
politics, science and literature. In
1898, the journal Philadelphia was
started. Ananda and Rosario Lodges
were founded 1899 ; and in 1901
Dharma Lodge, the only one of these
four pioneer centres still in existence.
The visit of Colonel Olcott in 1901 gave
a great impetus to Theosophical activity
in South America. He appointed Don
Luis Schneider as Argentina’s first
Presidential Agent ; succeeding Agents
before the Section was formed, 6 June
1919, were Èinar K. With, Federico
W. Fernandez, and José Malian. The
visit of Dr. Rosa de Luna, great
scientist, in 1909 was also a tremendous
stimulus. Other important lecture
tours were : 1923, Ernest Wood ; 1924,
the poet Rabindranath Tagore ; 1934,
C. Jinarajadasa ; 1935, J. Krishna-
murti.
Argentina has mothered first through
a Presidential Agent and then as a
Section all of the other South American
Sections and Federations and has taken
a prominent part in the South American
Federation.
Propaganda : An effort is being
made to form new Lodges in La Plata,
Rafaela, Casilda and Parana.
Since 1918, the Argentine Theosophi­
cal Library, with more than 300 mem­
bers and 8,000 volumes of Theosophical
and other literature, has been one of the
greatest agents for bringing members
into The Society. This Library
publishes leaflets and books, and organ­
izes Sunday public lectures. The Read­
ing Room is open to the public, and
subscribers pay a small monthly fee.
Kuntur, official organ of Section, and
Evolueion, of the Library, are Theo­
sophical expressions of national Art,
Science and Literature.
The Congress of South American
Lodges held in Argentina in 1935
brought The Society before the
public.
AUSTRALIA
Governor-General of Common­
wealth in British Empire: His
Excellency Lord Gowrie, V.C., P.C.,
C.G.M.G., C.B., £).S.O. 23 January
1936-. J y
National Summary ;
The note of this virile young country :
“ The Spirit of Adventure, and of
Brotherhood, and a widespread Ap­
preciation of the Beautiful.” (G.S.A.)
Within a century Australia, while re­
maining 98% British, has clearly
marked out within its .borders a
new Aryan type. Various authorities
have marked these differences; and
some have envisioned the Australian
archetype. In 1915, Bishop Lead-
beater stated in public lectures : VA
new and distinctly Australian race is
coming to birth. . . . The principal
characteristics will certainly include
strong will, great intellectual develop­
ment, and ready impressibility. ’’ During
the many years he lived in Australia he
lent his powers to the development of
the new race type. Sir Philip Gibbs
observed it in .the Great W ar: “ It
was when the Australians came—many
T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L YEAH BOOK, 1937 J7 *
of them from the hell of Gallipoli—that
one saw a new type of British manhood.
. . . They had a gypsy look at times,
but many of their hatchet faces and tall,
loose-limbed bodies would have made
them good models for Arthur’s knights
—Lancelot and Galahad.” Dr. Piet
Roest, anthropologist, distinguishes be­
tween the American and the Australian
branches of the new race : 4' Wedge
face . . . cheeks not full and round, as
with the almost square-faced Americans,
but tapering towards the narrow front
of the jaws, falling in line wfth the firm
but narrow chin. In the finer types the
whole expression of face and body
suggestsa curious combination of delicacy
and strength, of child-like sensitiveness
and dogged determination. The im­
pression of concentration is strengthened
by the thin nose and close-set eyes,
while the cheek-bones are rather high, ’ ’
Mr. Jinarajadasa finds the Australian
intuitive, he has 4
4the Englishman’s
reasoning ability, with intuition as
well.” The rapid unfoldment of this
new type is aided by the tropic sun in
40% of the country’s area and the
above-average shower *of 44cosmic rays ’’
which equals that in California.
4
4The Australian is nearer the spirit of
Australia than is the average man to the
spirit of his country, because the future
is nearer to the Australian, as the past
is nearer the citizen of many other na­
tions. The true Australian bears the.
mark of the Australian upon him : He is
openhearted, he is sincere, he is simple,
he.has vision.” (G.S.A.) Out of such
qualities arise leadership and to Aus­
tralia the world must look for men
and women, who can vision over
far horizens newer solutions to world
problems.
Australia has for over a decade given
social security to children, invalids and
the aged through adequate pension
allowances where the family income
falls below a living wage. Men and
women alike have the power to vote and
hold office.
The 1936-7 budget abolishes and dimin­
ishes many taxes, restores salary cuts,
increases pensions and maternity allow«
ances, and gives higher research grants
thus reflecting the remarkable economic
recovery of the Commonwealth.
Australia has taken a prominent part
in support of the League of Nations,
thus creating favourable opinion among,
the Mandated Territories. A chair of
anthropology founded at Sydney Univer­
sity should help to train suitable
administrative officers.
Australia is attempting to solve great
political and social problems by ah
innate quality of naturalness, a com­
plete absence of artificiality which is her
gift to the world.
Cultural Activities:
The pioneers of Australia built a
University before they had a water
supply and founded a library before the
streets were made. Primary education
is free and compulsory and higher
education is of the finest. State
grants enable the 44out-back ’’ child­
ren to travel to the nearest schools
and where this is impossible a system of
correspondence tuition, even for young
children, is successfully developing.
The Theosophical Society for years has
played an intimate part in the cultural
growth of the Commonwealth. Through
2GB, the Theosophical Broadcasting
Station, have spread waves of goodwill
and spiritual influence. Many Theos-
ophists have been active in the educa­
tional and artistic field.
Theosophy in Australia:
Gen. Sec. Ray G, Litchfield, 1936.
History : Theosophy was introduced
into Australia by W. H. Terry, a book­
seller and editor of the spiritualistic
journal, Harbinger of Light. In 1880
he ordered four copies of The Theos-
ophist and fourteen copies the next
year. In 1882 he served on its General
Council. The first actual nucleus was*
the Brisbane Lodge, formed in 1881 by
Carl Hartmann of Toowoomba, Queens**
land. The first Australian to contact
the Founders was Hon. J. Smith, who
visited them in Bombay in 1882.- An
early group of Theosophical students
was that in Melbourne who called them­
selves the Gnostic Society. They were
unable to organize as a Lodge until 1890
because of the difficulty in getting
sponsors for membership applications.
58 The theosophical year book, 1937
Other early Lodges were Wellington,
N.Z., 1888 and Hobart, 1890. The
President-Founder’s action in 1891 of
turning the bulk of the Hartmann estate
back to the legal heirs created a tide of
enthusiasm in Australia for Theosophy.
Sydney, Toowoomba and Adelaide
Lodges were formed during his lecture '
tour, and \before leaving he issued a
charter for an Australasian Section,
nominating Dr. A. Carroll as General
Secretary pro tern, and W. T. Willans
as his assistant. This charter was never
officially used until the visit of Mrs.
Annie Besant in 1894 who persuaded
J. C. Staples of England to come* to
Australasia and organize the Section,*
and serve as its first General Sec­
retary.
The visit of Mrs. Cooper-Oakley in
1893 had added life and vitality, and she
founded The Australasian Theosophist
(1894), a finely printed journal, edited
by Mr. E. Besant-Scott of Melbourne,
and succeeding a small typewritten
sheet, The Upadhi, produced by a
Sydney Lodge. This become Theosophy
in Australasia in 1895. Mrs. Cooper-
Oakley served as President of the first
League of Lodges— “ The Victorian
Theosophical League,’’ and in 1894
T. H. Martyn became President of
“ The Theosophic League, N .S .W ,”
thus showing the organizing tendency
of Australasia, even before the material­
ization of the Section.
Australia has not only a great
many devoted workers within its own
ranks, but was assisted by the lecture
tours of Dr. Besant, 1894 and 1908 ;
Countess Wachtmeister, 1896; Col.
Olcott, 1898 ; Miss Lilian Edger, 1898
and for many subsequent years;
C. W. Leadbeater 1905, 1907; Mrs,
Ransom, 1912; C. Jinarajadasa and
J. I. Wedgwood, 1918 and following
years, Miss Mary K. Neff-1922-7, 1935 ;
and many other international lecturers.
Mrs. Ransom and Miss Clara M. Codd
both assisted the Section as General
Secretaries.
But the greatest of all influences in
moulding the Theosophical destinies
of Australia was the establishment of
The Manor and long stay of Bishop
Leadbeater (1914-1931) with his group
of pupils and helpers in that Spiritual
Centre for the Southern Hemisphere.
He stimulated the work for young
people—Lotus Circles, Round Tables,
Theosophical Schools, etc., the revival
of Christian mysticism in the Liberal
Catholic Church movement, and the
esoteric aspect of ceremonial in the
Co-Masonic Order. Australia was also
greatly vitalized by the work of Dr.
Arundale, 1926-30, who aroused not
only Theosophists but all Australia to
the possibilities of its glorious future
through the Advance Australia
Journal. Under his leadership the first
Theosophical Broadcasting Station 2GB
was founded in 1926, and took its place
quickly as the premier commercial
Station, and its influence on public
thought has been considerable. Austral­
ia as a land of golden promise has
been still further helped by the many
lecture tours of Mr. Jinarajadasa, who
during most of 1935-6 resided in Sydney
as the head of The Manor.
As vigorous a Section as Austra­
lia could hardly expect to escape
severe upheaval! from time to time,
and The Society there has had its
minor and major convulsions. But
the Theosophical work steadily goes
forward.
Propaganda: Australia has always
been a vigorous centre of Theosophical
propaganda from the days when it
distributed the first volume of The Theos­
ophist in 1880. As an example, 3,000
copies of .„Dr.. .Besant’s Au stralian
Lectures 1908 were sold through the
dftief booksellers of the country, and
7,000 copies of leaflets were sent to the
clergy and other leading citizens. In
1909 all libraries (350) were presented
with a copy of TheJj.ncientMiedom^
Even before the formation of the Section
a Theosophical journal of some type
was consistently published. An effort
has always been made to contact the
Press, and this culminated in connection
with the Advance Australia movement
in a weekly Press Service Release Sheet
which was edited by J. L. Davidge and
served to make the public even more
Theosophy-conscious* Through 2GB*
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y EA R BOOK, 1937 59
beforementioned, an enormous public
was contacted over the air. A Radio
Lodge was formed in 1935 with 80
members, the first of its kind in the
world.
The splendid halls and buildings
owned by the various centres, and
the fine Headquarters, Adyar House,
29 Bligh St., Sydney, all create a
favourable impression of stability on
the Australian public. Melbourne, too,
is building an imposing edifice on
the site of Queen’s Hall in Collins
Street. *
The Youth Movement is co-ordi­
nated by the little magazine Zest^
edited by Bert Ferrie, and the work
of the Round Table in Brisbane has.
resulted in the formation of a Youth
Group in the local League of Nations
Union.
The name of the Section Journal has
been changed from News and Notes to
Theosophy in Australia.
AUSTRIA
H ead o f R epu blic : Dr. Wilhelm
„Miklas, re-elected 9 Oct. 1931.
N ational S u m m ary:
Keynote: “ The Spirit of Culture,
into which the Spirit of the Quest
largely enters.” —G.S.A.
Austria for centuries has been the
melting-pot of divers nationalities.
There is hardly a nationality in Europe
unrepresented in Vienna. As a con­
sequence the quality of adaptability and
a warm welcome of foreigners are
greatly in evidence throughout Austria.
Service to the Austrian is not a creed,
or a business expedient, but naturally
and spontaneously it *is an expression
of an inner urge.
After severe internal struggles in the
young Republic since its formation 12
November 1918, a new order has emerg­
ed with the present Constitution, which
came into force 1 May 1934. Dr,
Engelbert Dollfuss, emergency dictator,
lived just long enough before his assassi­
nation to see his dreams realized and
Austria stabilized. Dr. Kurt Schusch-
nigg, the present Federal Chancellor,
continues the work inaugurated by Dr.
Dollfuss. The new Constitution grants
to all citizens, men and women alike,
equality before the law both as to suff­
rage and the holding of office. A fine
feature of the new regime is the advisory
representation given to cultural and
Economic groups of people through a
Cultural Council, consisting of represen­
tatives of Religion, Education, and Art;
and an Economic Council made up of
representatives from the professions—
Agriculture, Business, Mining, etc.
There is also a State Council consisting
of citizens of merit and character, who»
from their past service to the State may
be expected to have a full understanding,
of the needs and duties of the State ;
and a Provincial Council consisting of
the eight Governors and their finance
members. From these Councils are
chosen the members of the Federal Diet,
or legislative body, the Councils acting
as its advisory bodies. Religious liberty
is a fundamental principle. Ninety
per cent of the population is Roman
Catholic. Elementary education is com­
pulsory, and there is ample opportunity
for higher education provided by the
State. A Juvenile Court adjusts the
problems of young offenders. Un­
employment insurance went into effect
24 March 1920. Since 1863 the poor
who are unable to obtain assistance
from any other source may claim sub­
sistence, medical aid and nursing service
from their native parish. Austria is con­
solidating its new order.
One of the most important and far-
reaching steps taken by Austria in 1936
was the establishment of friendly re­
lations with Germany, wherein Germany
agreed to withdraw Nazi propaganda
and agitation for 1
4Anschluss ’ ’ or
amalgamation of the two countries,
recognizing the full sovereignty of
Austria ; and Austria agreed to remove
certain taxes on German visitors and
import of German publications ; and to
recognize herself in principle as a
German State, this in no way to affect
T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L Y EA R BOOK, 1937
Ke Rome Protocol relationships of
1934-6. This rapprochemenf removes
one of the factors of constant friction
and, if these two great nations continue
as 4
4good neighbours ” should stabilize
conditions in Central Europe.
«Cultural Activities:
Culture, having gained a voice in
Government, is a dominant factor in
the national life. Austria is promoting
a Brotherhood of Culture through
4
4Cultural Treaties” with Italy and
Hungary, aiming at the exchange of
artists and artistic objects. Recently a
aeries of plays called The Voice of the
Nations in Dramq promoted apprecia­
tion of the spiritual treasures of all«
nations. The Salzburg Festival Plays
are a unique achievement of Austrian
art, both in drama and music. Austria’s
commanding position astride several of
the great European crossways suggests
not only a hopeful economic future,
but a revival of Vienna as one of the
world’s great centres of cultural in­
spiration.
Theosophy in Austria:
General Secretary: Fritz Franz
Schleifer.
History: The Vienna Theosophical
Society was organized in 1887 with
Friedrich Eckstein, as President. Little
came of the movement until 1912 when
John Cordes was sent from Adyar to
organize the Section. General Schemua
greatly assisted in overcoming official
resistance to the new organization and
the new Section came into existence
11 January 1913 with John Cordes as
General Secretary. Over the doors of
the first meeting room, owned by the
Knights of Malta, figures the Maltese
Cross. To Mr. Krishnamurti’s generous
gift of fifty pounds, the Section owes its
establishment 22 years ago in its present
beautiful Headquarters in an aristocratic
district of Vienna. This was shared for
fifteen years by the Order of the Stan
During the World War, the Section
Headquarters was closed, and the
General Secretary was forbidden to
lecture and in 1917 finally exiled. Mme
de Redlich purchased many more books
which were distributed during these
dark years and translations went steadily
forward, so the light of Theosophy was
only partihlly obscured.
March 25, 1919, marked the return of
John Cordes and propaganda went on
apace, an average of 150 members
joining every year. In 1923 the Austrian
Section entertained the European Feder­
ation at Vienna and the Theosophcn-
heim, centre of Theosophical and allied
activities, was established on the out­
skirts of Vienna. During periods of
greatest financial stress, the Section
refused to discontinue its journal which
brought to the whole of Central Europe
interesting articles on Theosophy ; de­
voted members typed out each issue,
and so the Section courageously carri­
ed on.
Propaganda : The greatest activity
is in Vienna through informal talks and
social and artistic gatherings for people
interested in Theosophy ; and the publi­
cation of translations and original
Theosophical booklets. The monthly
journal, Theosophimbe Nachrichten,
continues its excellent work of publish­
ing many translations, etc. In this
difficult period of financial and political
readjustment the Section is utilizing
every means ,in its power to keep the
Theosophical torch alight in Austria.
BELGIUM
K IN G : Leopold III, born 3 Novem­
ber 1901, succeeded his father 23
February 1934.
National Summary:
Keynote: 4
4The Spirit of Indepen­
dence and Virility.” —G.S.A.
Though Belgium has at one time or
another been under the dominance of
Spain, Austria, France, Holland, and
Germany, there remains a distinctive
Belgian type, called by some 4
4the in­
tractable Belgian,” for no discipline
has daunted him or made him sub­
servient to authority. Through the
successive occupations, he has never
assimilated ihe psychic character of the
T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 61
dominant nation, but remains above all
a Belgian. His mind is realistic, he
desires adequate proof and complete
understanding before acceptance, and is
marked by good judgment and delibera­
tion, never yielding to the lure of pro­
paganda. Seldom expressing emotion,
on occasions the Belgian can display a
stormy and magnificent patriotism.
While ardently desiring freedom for
themselves, Belgians are essentially
pacific and hold no hatred toward
other countries. They have a keen
sense of the social needs of the
world. The first King of the Belgians,
Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, was
elected by a National Congress, 4 June
1831 ; the royal succession is in the
direct male line in the order of primo­
geniture. Legislative power is vested
in the King, the Senate and the Chamber
of Representatives. A universal male
suffrage, with the addition of the votes
of women who have suffered cer­
tain war1losses (the loss of husband,
son, etc.), elects both Houses. In
local government there is universal
suffrage.
The May 1936 election showed a
Socialist increase in power in the
National Union Government, with the
addition of a new " Rex ” party whose
ideal is to strengthen Government
influence; it also advocates female
suffrage. Seats are distributed : So­
cialists, 70 ; Catholics, 63 ; Liberals,
23 ; Rexists, 21 ; Flemish Nationalists,
16 ; Communists, 9. Provincial Coun­
cils in the June election show out of
696 seats to be filled : Socialists, 221 ;
Catholics, 224 ; Liberals, 89 ; Rexists,
78. The Prime Minister, M. van Zee-
land, is a young man of 43 who took
over the Ministry three years ago when
Belgium was on the verge of political
and financial collapse. Though a
Catholic he was again been asked by
the King to lead the Government. The
new Government has made a declara­
tion of many forward measures, includ­
ing a 40-hour week, a 6-day annual holi­
day, a minimum wage of 32 francs for
an 8-hour day, unemployment insurance,
employer-employee industrial commis­
sions, redemption of foreign loans,
5
public works to reduce unemployment,
national control of arms and war sup­
plies, etc. The Government is also
attempting to deal with the very serious
splits into Flemish and French factions,
which have existed for many years,
by announcing that henceforth Army
officers will be enabled to carry out all
their studies in the Flemish language
and that a Flemish Academy of Science
will be created. A young King, a young
Prime Minister, and many comparative­
ly young men in high office, will have
an opportunity to demonstrate what
youth can do at the helm.
Belgium cannot be adequately con­
sidered save with reference to her great
colony, the Belgian Congo, eighty times
larger than Belgium, with a 9,000,000
native p o p u 1at i o n of Bantu and
Sudanese origin, and an 18,000 white
population. Some 3,000 missionaries,
the majority Roman Catholic, with the
aid of government grants, are giving
medical aid and elementary education.
Cultural Activities:
Not only is there full religious liberty,
but religion is held in such high esteem
in Belgium that part of the income of
the ministers of all denominations is
paid from the national treasury. The
majority of those professing religion are
Roman Catholic.
Each commune must have at least
one primary school, the expense for
which is borne by the commune with
subsidies from the State and provinces.
22% of the people speak two languages,
7% of these speaking three. There are
many universities, conservatoires, tech­
nical and pre-university schools. Prizes
awarded through the Royal Academy
(founded 1769) are keenly contested.
Belgian Art is realistic, both in music
and painting. Note such artists as
Rubens, Jordaens, Teniers, Breughel
and such a modern musician as Tongen.
The exceptions are Cesar Franck in
modern music, Memling in ancient
painting, and Jean Delville in modern.
The note of all Belgian art is colour.
As the Belgian public are so keenly
critical, when once an artist has won
approval in Belgium, his future is
assured in other countries.

founded in 1890 by Mme H. de Neufville
and Mme Johanna Stout. In 1891 two
centres, which had previously been

direction of M.A. Oppermann, amalga­
mated in the Charleroi Centre, 1892,
taking rooms for Theosophical prop­
aganda, and existing as a Lodge 1892-4.
The Section was organized 7 June
1911 by the great artist-sculptor, Jean
Delville, first General Secretary. The
present General Secretary has held
ofiice since 1813. The steadiness of the
Section is witnessed by the existence
today of some of its very oldest Lodges :
Brussels (chartered 1898) ; Antwerp
(1899) ; Central (1901) ; White Lotus
(1903).
Propaganda : A new p e r i o d i c a l
Uranus on Theosophical lines, has been
courageously undertaken, by Messrs.
Chapellier and Lemesrè and space in it
is reserved for Sectional information.
A feature of the lectures regularly
delivered at headquarters is the musical
programmes which precede them.
The Section has been favoured with
visits by many eminent international
lecturers. A newly organized H.P.B..
Training Class is enthusiastically train­
ing lecturers for the field.
Brussels headquarters is noted for
artistic productions by young people
directed by Serge Brisy : the 1936 drama
" The King's Dream " was one of the
most beautiful. The order of Service
and the International Order of Arts and
Crafts are active.
The Section takes advantage of All
Souls day to distribute near the ceme­
teries leaflets on Reincarnation and
Death.
The sacrifices of a small number of
members have enabled the Section to
balance its budget and amortize ap­
proximately Frs. 18,000 of its mortgage
debts.
The 25th Anniversary of the Belgian.
Section marked a new cycle of life,
especially attributed to close cooperation
with the President’s Campaigns.
BRAZIL
President o f R epu blic : Dr. Getu-
lio Vargas, 3 Nov. 1930-34, 18 July
1934.
N ational Sum m ary :
A crucible wherein diverse racial
elements are being blended into the
Unity of Brotherhood. Brazil has
taken many forward steps during the
transitional period between the revolu­
tion of 1930 and the formal Constitution
on 16 July 1934 of a new Republic.
The new Constitution embodies advanc­
ed statecraft ; it differs chiefly from the
old in the very large powers given the
State to regulate industry, gradually to
nationalize the banks and insurance
companies and to monopolize, subject
to compensation, any forms of industrial
activity thought desirable. Both em­
ployees and employers in agriculture,
industry, commerce, and transport are
separately represented in the Chamber
of Deputies. The liberal professions
have also their representatives in the
Chamber. Literate men and women
over eighteen years are compelled to
vote. Capital punishment has been
abolished. There is a form of judicial
separation but no divorce.
Few countries have progressed so far
toward economic rehabilitation as
Brazil, notwithstanding depression,
THE THEOSOPHICAL YEAR BOOK, 1937
communist uprisings, etc. The power to
resist the shock of the extremely low
prices of coffee and other staple exports
is traceable to the great undeveloped
resources of the country and the urge
of a growing population with small
consuming power to improve its living
conditions. Another factor is the little
advertised but heroic fight which Brazil
has made against its greatest plague, the
'' seccas ’ ’ or droughts which periodi­
cally endanger the existence of millions
of industrious citizens, especially in the
North-East. Prior to 193(J no fewer
than 91 huge dams had been erected
and 25 are under construction, A new
lease of life has been given to several
millions of people by 6,500 kilometres
of new roads. Agreements with
Argentina for mutual co-operation
constitute a forward step.
Cultural Activities:
Brazil is one of the most beautiful
contries in the world : Birds are famous
for the» beauty of their plumage and
their singing; butterflies of 5,000
varieties are of incomparable beauty,
and the richness of the flora, particular­
ly the orchid family, is remarkable.
Precious stones vie with the beauty of
the capital city, Rio de Janeiro, itself a
jewel of the Pacific. In such natural
surroundings, it is little wonder that
the Fine Arts play a prominent part and
Government itself maintains schools for
Art and Music. A conservatory was
established as early as 1841. Edu­
cation is free and in seven States com­
pulsory, and the Government under­
takes to provide in part for higher or
university instruction. The National
Library (founded 1807) contains over
a half million volumes and a wealth
of manuscript. The Brazilian His­
torical and Geographical Institute
(dating from 1838) is the oldest
South American historical society.
The Brazilian Academy of Letters
is modelled upon the French Academy.
There are many technical schools.
Scientific Research is followed assidu­
ously and two recent discoveries are of
special note : The cure of leprosy by
the external application of chaulmoogra
o il; and the study^
of the use of oxygen
63’
under pressure for the cure of cancer.
Brazilians have achieved notable success
in conquering tropical diseases (yellow
fever, neutralizing'snake bites, etc.).
Large sums have been spent on the
public health. Sports arouse great
enthusiasm.
Though the population is overwhelm­
ingly Roman Catholic, there are
numerous evangelic sects and advanced
thought cults and non-Christian re­
ligions have a generous representation.
The new Constitution restores the
link between Church and State for all
religions, and religious teaching is
encouraged in the schools.
Theosophy in Brazil:
General Secretary : Prof. M. B. de
Lima, who is chairman of an Execu­
tive Committee of six members.
History: The earliest Lodge in
Brazil was the Dharma Theosophical
Society chartered in 1905 in Pelotas,
Rio Grande del Sud. A tremendous
stimulus to the work came with the
advent of Com. Raimundo Pinto Siedl,
first President of Lodge Perseveranca,
chartered in Rio de Janeiro 5 June
1910, and three more Lodges came into
existence before 1914. Brazil worked
under a South American Presidential
Agent until its organization as a Section
20 January 1920 under Com. Siedl,
General Secretary, who fathered the
Section for eight years, Brazil has
always encouraged young people and
its oldest living Lodge (Perseveranca)
devotes itself especially to their develop­
ment ana activities.
Propaganda: Close contacts have
been made with the cultural elements of
the country who often co-operate in
Theosophical activities. An example
of this was the “ Blavatsky Week ” in
Rio de Janeiro, 1931, and Mr. Jinara-
jadasa’s recent South American tour in
which the cultured and artistic non-
Theosophical public gave splendid as?
sistance, and responded most enthusias­
tically to Mr. Jinarajadasa’s prophetic
message of South America’s future
greatness as a nucleus of the Seventh
Race. One fine contribution given by
Brazil to Theosophy is "T h e Thep-
sophical Hymn Mwritten by Viscountess
* 64 *nHE TH E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
06 Sande) for the Blavatsky Week.
Brazil has active Press and Radio
Departments which popularize Theos­
ophy in South America. The public­
ity division contains also a Pamphlet
Department which puts out Portuguese
and Spanish Theosophical propaganda.
Lecture tours are conducted under the
unique title of 44Voyages of Instruction
and Propaganda.” Altogether Brazil
is a vital stronghold of Theosophy in
South America.
BULGARIA
Reigning King (Czar), Boris III,
succeeded to the throne on the abdi­
cation of his father, 3 October 1918.
National Summary:
N ote: An indomitable persistence
that eventually triumphs over obstacles.
Bulgarians founded the first Slav State -
679 A.D., and in 865 adopted Christi­
anity as its religion. The First Kingdom,
in the reign of King Simeon (892-927)
comprised the territories of Rumania,
Hungary, Yugoslavia, Albania and
Epirus. During this period the invention
of the Bulgarian alphabet made possible
the translation of ecclesiastical and
philosophical literature, a great cultural
contribution to the Slavonic races.
From 1018 Bulgaria declined under
.the Byzantine yoke until the formation
of the Second Kingdom, 1186-1393,
under which again the country reached
a high level of prosperity, sending out
into Western Europe a Religious-
Humanitarian movement under the name
of the Albigenses.
After an exhausting struggle the
country was conquered for the second
time and came under Turkish rule for
some five hundred years. Aroused by
the fiery speeches of Father Paissy, a
monk of Mount Athos, the national
consciousness reawakened, European
public opinion was stirred up, and after
eighteen years as a Principality under
Turkish suzerainty, Bulgaria declared
her complete independence 5 October
1896, her third incarnation as a national
entity*
The present ruler came to the throne
in a period of financial and economic
difficulties, but rapidly succeeded in
gaining the affection and respect of his
subjects, among whom he moved very
freely. Out of a Bulgaria »torn with
Civil strife and disunion between a large
peasant party and the intelligentsia,
there is now a promise of return to con­
stitutional ^government, and a renewal
of constructive patriotism. The King’s
policy promoted peaceful and equitable
conditions with an especial regard for
the rights of labour, for since 2 August
1919, an 8- and 6-hour day has been in
effect. Cordial relations with the adja­
cent countries of Yugoslavia and
Rumania have been steadily maintained.
Cultural Activities :
The Clergy of the Orthodox (Greek)
Church and of other religious bodies
are paid by the State. Elementary
education is obligatory and free for
children between 7 and 14. There are
many facilities for higher and cultural
education most of them under National
control. A Free University teaches
political and economic science. Mu­
seums, picture galleries, an up-to-date
National Theatre and Opera, and the
National choruses and dances, appre­
ciated all over Europe, all give artistic
outlet to the people’s genius.
There is arising a new school of liter­
ature marked by originality in form ;
limpidity and sincerity pushed to the
point of candour. With artistic realism
scenes drawn from simple everyday life
are portrayed. A whole group of young
poets and talented writers of fiction are
the advance-guard of this new age in
Bulgarian literature.
Theosophy in Bulgaria :
General Secretary : Nikola Trifonov,
1935-8. Assisted by a Council of five
members.
History; In 1894, the first Theo­
sophical group was formed under the
chairmanship of M. Anastassieff, who
with the collaboration of his brother,
N. Moushoff, a well-known archaeolo­
gist; published some small books on
T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L YEAR BOOK, 1937 65 ‘
Theosophy, In 1903, the first Theo-
sophical Lodge (Sophia) was formed in
Sofia with Sophrony Nickoff as chair­
man. This Lodge translated and pub­
lished Theosophical booker and estab­
lished its own organ, The Theosophical
Review. It ceased to exist and again
a Lodge was formed 1 March, 1907,
which carried on with Theosophical
publications and the journal The Path
is in Thee. The first National Congress
was held in Sofia in 1912, and a steady
interest was maintained in Theosophy
during the ensuing years fill the for­
mation of the Bulgarian Section, 4 April
1920, with Sophrony Nickoff as first
General Secretary. Theosophy and
The Society in Bulgaria are held in
high esteem and the Hall of the National
University in Sofia has been opened to
Theosophical lectures. The Society in
Bulgaria is frequently asked to co­
operate with other social and national
organizations.
‘‘ Theosophy throughout the world ’ ’
was the theme of a series of meetings
held jointly by the Lodges and the
public, with the General Secretary in
the chair, tq promote the Straight
Theosophy Campaign, On lOth October
1936 the Seventeenfh Annual Conven­
tion was ppened by the President,
Dr. Arundale, and in a twice-packed
hall an enthusiastic audience listened
with deep appreciation to Shrimati
Rukmini Devi’s address on “ India’s
Genius in the Arts.” During 1936
the Section concentrated on supplying
the need for Theosophical literature in
the Bulgarian language. One group of
members worked on translations; another
collected funds, with the result that for
the first time since 1926 there is a Theo­
sophical •
*
journal Orpheus (Orfei) in
Bulgaria, and this activity has induced
an unknown donor to give 100,000 levs
for publishing Theosophical literature.
Another welcome development, is a
generous donation practically ensur­
ing the erection of a National
T. S. Headquarters. Bulgarian Theos-
ophists are showing the national
quality of triumphantly surmounting
obstacles.
BURMA
Governor of Province of British
Em pire : H. E. Commander the Hon.
Archibald Douglas Cochrane, R. N.
(retired), D. S. O., 11 February 1936-.
N ational Sum m ary: ,
j Burma’s Task: “ To proclaim the
I message of Lord Buddha in all its i
' purity and I f f i t s glory.” (N. A. Naga- j
: nathan, Gen. Sec.) In Burma Re­
ligion is so bound up in the life of
the people that the nation cannot be
considered apart from its cultural
activities. The most important event
in Burma’s history for 1935-6 was its
political separation from the Indian
Empire and the many treaty adjustments
necessary with India to insure the main­
tenance of stable equilibrium during the
transitional period.
Nearly every man and many women
have lived in the monasteries or nun­
neries as novices for at least a few
months, and thus have had training in
self-discipline and an intimate knowl­
edge of the purity and holiness of the
Buddhist.,Brothers. This accounts for
—the high respec’Fln which religion is
held in Burma and may even be the
basis for that great charity which is
characteristic of the Burmese people.
Dire poverty is utterly unknown, for
the people’s charity to each other is all-
embracing. Even the poorest man will
put out jars of clear, cool water by the
roadside under a little stand to refresh
weary travellers. In almost every village
there is a Buddhist monastery where
a good primary education is given
to all children. As a consequence,
Burma ranks as the most literate
Province in the Indian Empire.
The Rangoon University provides two
Arts Colleges, a Medical, and a
Teachers’ Training College. Technical
colleges and institutes provide special
ized training. ¿B f

Theosophy in Burma;
General Secretary: N. A. Nagana-
than, 1928-.
History : From the inception of the
Theosophical movement in 1885, T. S.
Lodges have been intimately linked
with the religious and social life of
Burma. The first visit of the President-
Founder, accompanied by C. W. Lead-
beater, was made at the request of*
King Theebaw, to stimulate a revival of
Buddhism in his country. Again in
1891, 1892, and 1893, in the interests
of Buddhism Colonel Olcott visited
Burma. His Buddhist Catechism
became a text-book in the schools and
his fiery enthusiasm for the spread of
^Buddhist Dharma aroused the already
devotional people whose national
characteristic of “ Sweet Joviality”
made them most responsive, to make
practical application of their ideals in
many fields of cultural life, such as the
Buddhist school at Moulmein, etc.
Theosophy has had a constant in­
fluence on the religious life of Burma
since 1885 when the first three Lodges
were formed: The Rangoon Theo­
sophical Society for Hindus ; the Shwe
Dagon Theosophical Society for
Buddhists, and the Irawaddy Theo­
sophical Society for Europeans and
Anglo-Indians. The Lodges had their
active and dormant periods, and The
Society as an organization was not
^stabilized until the visit in 1899 of the
President-Founder, accompanied by
Dr. AnnieJEtesa&tand the Prince-Priest
of "Sam, Since' 1899~ the..Rangoon—
TfieosophlCal Society has steadily
spread the message of Theosophy,
reviving the other dormant Lodges,
erecting a permanent headquarters and
book depot in Rangoon, and in 1902
establishing The Society in the com­
munity as a religious and charitable
institution.
Among many early T.S. workers
were W. A. Pereira, U. Shwe Hla,
U. Shwe Oh, Captain W. C. Prince,
N. G. Cholmeley, and particularly
M. Subramania Iyer to whom Burma
owes much for his many years of
sacrifice*.
The next great impetus to Theosophy
in Burma ^came with the visit of Dr.
Besant, C. W. Leadbeater and several
other Theosophists in January 1911.
On the 1st of October, 1912, the Burma
Section was formed with Maung Thain
Maung as its first General Secretary.
The Section organ, The Message of
Theosophy, first published in 1904, was
revived, and has since been regularly
issued. C. W. Leadbeater again helped
the Section in 1914 and 1926 ; C. Jina-
rajadasa in 1915 and many subsequent
years; and many other international
lecturers.
Propaganda: The Society is held in
high esteem by the Bhikkus of Burma
who consider that Theosophy is Buddh­
ism devoid of superstition. Several
hundred Bhikkus are members. Leaf­
lets and pamphlets have since the
earliest years been distributed by the
thousand. The public libraries and
literary clubs have been well supplied
with Theosophical books. Since 1913
the Burma Theosophical Educational
Trust has maintained schools, with a
recognized high standard of cultural
development. Other social activities
include : A Women’s League; a Burma
Humanitarian League, which has practi­
cally stopped animal sacrifices in non-
Buddhist temples and has secured over
a lakh of pledges to abstain from animal
food; Boy Scouts, etc. The Youth
Federation inaugurated 17 November
1935 reports a splendid year of progress.
Burma Section has high ideals and fine
plans for the future.
CANADA
Head of Country: A Governor- His Majesty King Edward VIII, 2
General, Baron Tweedsmuir, acting for November 1935.
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y EA R BOOK, 1937 67-
National Summary:
Keynote: A new-old country : New
with the aggressive pioneer spirit of
nation building in the heart of the
w ilds' old with lineage and loyalty to
the traditions of a wéll-loved Mother­
land.
Canada is experimenting with Na­
tional ownership of a large trans­
continental railway, previously privately
mismanaged. A step of far-reaching
importance was taken early in 1936 by
Canada, when the Government set in
motion missions to take ovét control of
the banking system. Over 400 munici­
palities have united in a Hydro-Electric
Power System to produce cheap power
and light. Canadians are attempting to
solve the difficult problem -of whether or
not to regulate the production of their
wheat, the back-bone of national
industry. In 1934, production was cut
in half under a high tariff regime, but
a reversal of policy is now being
followed under the present Liberal
government. Many progressive mea­
sures have been instituted by Canada
within the last yea? in an effort to solve
the economic situation. A vigorous
campaign against unemployment was
launched in June, 1936.
An experiment which the world is
watching with interest is Alberta’s
Social Credit System, an attempt to wipe
•out the public debt. Each citizen re­
ceives a monthly dividend upon signing a
pledge of mutual co-operation. To keep
money in circulation and provide reve­
nue, a “ velocity dollar” has been
created which costs its holder 2c. if kept
longer than one week.
Canada, being directly represented on
the League of Nations, declined to co­
operate in the Pan-American Conference
called by President Roosevelt, as she
wished to do nothing to weaken the posi­
tion and effectiveness of the League. On
the other hand the most friendly rela­
tions are maintained with the United
States. The encouragement of Teu­
tonic and Celtic immigration is be­
ing considered, as Canada does not
wish to adopt a ‘‘ dog-in-the-manger ’ ’
attitude with her abundant natural re­
sources,, which have so greatly aided a
steady upgrade from the recent world
depressiftn.
Cultural Activities: Canada is
famed for the annual exhibitions of
graphic arts, held under the auspices of
the Royal Canadian Academy, and the
Ontario Society of Arts. The national
Canadian Exhibition, held each August
in Toronto, is one of the greatest annual
Fairs in the world.
The Little Theatre movement holds
annual amateur dramatic competitions
with finals at Ottawa, judged by
English experts. Hart House, Uni­
versity of Toronto, has taken the lead
in» this and other movements fostering
the Drama, Music, and Literature.
In the last decade many musical
artists of note have arisen out of
Canada’s fine Conservatories.
The Canadian National War Memor­
ial, a majestic monument of Sacrifice
which King Edward VIII unveiled on
Vimy Ridge on July 24, 1936, was
created by Walter Allward, Canadian
sculptor and architect. It occupied his
energies for fourteen years.
The School of Seven have been ridi­
culed and lampooned, but their idealism,
largely based on what might be called
Theosophical theories of expression, has
made a strong impression on the public
taste.
O ’Callaghan’s realistic books and
Miss Mazo de la Roche’s Whiteoaks
series have gained great favour. In
1935, 812 new books were published in
Canada, including 78 poetry and 57
fiction; 204 were in French. The
Canadian Poetry Magazine com­
menced publication in 1936; total
periodicals 1748. The Royal Society of
Canada distinguishes Canadian authors
by election to its fellowship.
Education is almost entirely State-
controlled, and in most provinces free
through the college-preparatory stages.
There are special schools for aboriginal
Indian youth. Juvenile offenders are
tried in special courts.
Theosophy in Canada:
Three organizations represent The
Society in Canada : ^

tario ; (
The Canadian Federation (8
Lodges), Mr. Albert J. Harrison, Van­
couver, Secretary-Treasurer ;
The H.P.B. Lodge, Toronto, Ontario,
Mrs. G. Aitleen, Secretary.
Evidence of “ lost ” chemical ele­
ments no longer present on the earth
was found by Prof. George H. Hender­
son, Dalhousie University, Halifax,
Canada, from study of halos in mica
formed by radioactivity. William B.
Cartmel, University of Montreal, pre­
sented mathematical formulae ques­
tioning the validity of the theories
underlying the Michelson-Morley experir
ment to determine ether-drifts.
History : The first Lodge in Canada
was Toronto, charter in 1891 under the
American Section, with Albert E. S.
Smythe and A. H. Blackwood as
President and Secretary. At the time
of the Judge secession this Lodge
remained one of the few faithful to
Adyar. The next Lodge noted was the
Mount Royal in Montreal, chartered
1892 ; then Vancouver, B.c., 1898.
The Canadian Section was chartered
1919 with Mr. Smythe as General
Secretary.
Propaganda : The Canadian Section
reports three Fraternization Conven­
tions with other groups of Theo-
sophical students ; and a National tour
by Mr. Felix A. Belcher, stimu­
lating interest in Secret Doctrine
study classes, as their contribution to
progagandh. The Section journal, The
Canadian Theosophist was enlarged
for several issues, and the policy is
being continued of publishing standard
Theosophical works in serial form,
including a. classic translation of the
Bhagavad Gita.
The Canadian Federation welcomed
Mr. Jinarajadasa on his 1935 tour.
Most of their Lodges are promoting
the Research Seminar work of Mr.
Fritz Kunz.
CEYLON
Governor of Crown Colony of
British Empire : Sir Reginald Edward
Stubbs, G.C.M.G. 7 October 1933-.
National Summary :
i Keynote : The application of Lord
'Buddha’s teachings to life.
The Sinhalese are a quiet, happy,
affectionate, peace-loving people, in
whom religion has become embodied in
living. Adults of both sexes have territor­
ial franchise under certain limitations
and elect a State Council which aids
the King’s representatives in adminis­
tration. Ceylon’s benevolent Governor
is very popular. Ceylon is abreast of
civilization with model factories show­
ing the best methods of production, a
stimulation to manufacture ; a direct
telephone service with India, established
in 1935 ; and in construction one of the
best equipped airports in the East.
Cultural Activities :
The Buddhist priesthood is deeply
erudite, and among the High Priests of
the last 50 years we find such names as
Sumangala, Megittuwatte, Bulatgama,
and others known for their Scholarship
among Orientalists the world over.
Buddhism has raised in Ceylon some
magnificent temples.
Ceylon is an island of riotous colour
and aromatic fragrances. Among the
native manufactures are weaving, basket
work, tortoise-shell boxes, metal work,
lacquer work, and jewellery made up
with stones taken from the hundreds of
small-gem quarries of sapphires, rubies,
moonstones, catseyes, etc. While not
important industries commercially, they
satisfy the creative hunger of this
beauty-loving people. Even agriculture,
the principal occupation, takes on a new
meaning, amidst surroundings of such
luxuriant natural beauty.
Theosophy in Ceylon:
General Secretary, Dr. T. Nallai-
nathan.
History : Theosophy came to Ceylon
* in 1877 through the Buddhist priest
\Megittuwatte Gunananda, High Priest
^of the Temple at Kotahena, Colombo.
"He translated portions of a presentation
T H E T H E O S O P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 69*
copy of Isis Unveiled to further his
militant campaign for the revival of
Buddhism, the spiritual vitality of whlcTi
HSktf’Been greatly sapped by missionary
proselytism. He joined The Theo-
sophical Society through correspon­
dence, and interested H. Sumangala,
Principal of fhe Vidyodaya College for
Buddhist Priests. These two great
Buddhists invited the Founders to visit
Ceylon, and a question arose as to
whether they should locate the T.S.
Headquarters in Ceylon or India.
Though Adyar was chosen, it is a
significant fact that from May, 1880
(the date of the first visit 0Î Çôîonef
OÎUOÎT7 Madame BTavatsky and a dele-
gaflbif of Indian Theosophists), until
the President-Founder’s passing in 1907,
the movement in Ceylon claimed more
of his time and effort than any other
individual country with the exception of
India. On the first visit, the Founders
made a triumphal tour of the Island,
and formally identified themselves with
Buddhism by publicly taking pancha
sila amidst the enthusiasm of a multitude
who saw for the first time white men as
champions of their religion. Thus
began the second and permanent stage
of Buddhist revival.
The President-Founder brought all of
Ceylon Buddhism, the Chief Priests and
laymen, together inio The Theosophical
Society under a Buddhist Section " to
be composed of two subdivisions, one
exclusively laymen and lay branches
and another exclusively of priests.” In
this organization for the first time were
associated the Siam and Amarapoora
Sects. In the space of eight weeks the
Founders organized Lodges of this
Buddhist Section at Kandy, Colombo,
PânâdhTe, Bentota, Welitera, Galle,
Matara ; and a non-Buddhist .branch,
tEe Xanka, at Colombo. Before the.
Founders loft the Island the first Con­
vention was held of the seven Buddhist
Lodges to plan an immediate practical
campaign for Buddhist propaganda.
In April, 1881, the President-Founder
began to collect a National Education
fund to promote the education of B ud-
dhisl.-children. He summarized ’ the
simple teachings of Buddhism in a
Buddhist^ Catechism, which was care-
"fully bheoked" ani"pronounced authori­
tative by the High Priest Sumangala.
Published in both £nglish and Sin­
halese, it was adopted as a text-book
and found its way into every Buddhist

several years of earnest endeavour in the
educational field, founding the Ananda
College, organizing the Ceylon Section,,
and serving as its first General Secre­
tary, 1888-9. Special recognition should
be given to the long and devoted service
of Mrs. Musaeus-Higgins and Peter de
Abrew to the cause of Buddhist edu­
cation.
From 1889 to 1926, the Ceylon Sec­
tion, as such, did not exist, but the
individual Lodges carried on the edu­
cational work of the Buddhist Theo­
sophical Society reorganizing again
under Gen. Sec. Henri Frei.
Propaganda : The official (Govern­
ment) report of Ceylon’s educational
activities in 1935, shows a total of
407,904 or 65% of the Sinhalese children
receiving education in Buddhist schools,
of which 229 are directly under the
management of the Buddhist Theo­
sophical Society. Buddhists in Ceylon
now enjoy—thanks to the President-
Founder’s appeal to Government—a
toleration and freedom from missionary
persecution never experienced before his
intervention. To the Sinhalese has
been preserved a national consciousness
which was threatened with extinction,
with that of their Faith. The Buddhist
Flag, created by Theosophists in 1886,-
waves as a symbol of this renewal of
the soul of the people.
The great Days of Theosophy, Adyar
Day, Founders’ Day, etc., are observed
at celebrations to which the public are
invited. In 1935-6 Dr. Arundale and
Mr. Jinarajadasa lectured in Ceylon.
The Youth Lodge, Colombo, is active
both in T. S. and Sports Club and the
Section’s greatest asset are these fine
young men and women. The members,.

CHILE
President o f R e p u b lic : D o n
.Arturo Alessandri, 24 December 1932-8,
N a tion al S u m m ary:
Keynote : Independence, Innate Aris­
tocracy and Culture.
The keynote of the country was struck
in long-gone ages and was preserved in
the fastnesses of mountain areas by
tribes of Indians who still retain rem­
nants of the civilization of Atlantis.
This brave people with a burning love
of country made great sacrifices to
maintain their independence, which was
«acknowledged in 1724 by the Spanish
Dons from whom most of the Chileans
of today are descended.
The liberal Constitution and the
hospitality of the Chileans have en­
couraged foreigners to settle, thus
making cities of Chile cosmopolitan
centres. In municipal elections, for­
eigners of five years’ residence are
permitted to vote. Women have
municipal suffrage. The Government
in 1934 took over the control of the
70 Province subdivisions or “ Depart­
ments ” to safeguard a foreign loan.
.Ample coal and electrical power gives
Chile the possibilities for extended in­
dustrial development.
The year 1924 introduced a veritable
'«ra of social legislation, regulation of
labour contracts, salaries, hours of work,
hygienic conditions, conditions for wo­
men and children, security, arbitration,
syndical organization and methods of
co-operation. An extensive programme
for sanitary betterment was undertaken
by Government, which has resulted in
a lowered death rate. In December,
1935 the Government decided to
nationalize the Power Industry.
Chile has bravely come out of the
■depression, is balancing her budget,
paying interest on foreign debts, and
her exports in 1935 were 160% of her
imports. This favourable balance in
world trade is also one of the national
problems, for the temptation to overship
is strong. Wheat had to be bought
back in 11933, and so great was the
over-exportation in 1936 that Govern­
ment prohibited the export of certain
foodstuffs.
A very interesting plan was evolved
by Government in August 1936 to
protect the intellectuals, the greatest
sufferers from economic loss: Extra
working hours in all professions em­
ploying intellectuals and dual office­
holding were prohibited ; no one with a
private income over 2,000 pesos per year
can become or continue as a Govern­
ment officer; equal work, equal pay
for men and women, but women only
to form 20% of total personnel of
official and semi-official departments;
and 95% of all persons employed in
private industry to be of Chilean
nationality.
Cultural A c tiv itie s :
For many years the Roman Catholic
religion was maintained by the State,
and the laws tolerated no other; but
for over a century there has been no
marked opposition to the quiet per­
formance of worship under other faiths ;
in 1925 the church was dis-established.
There is no divorce.
Since 1850 Chile has been known for
the efforts of "Government in education,
and as early as 1857 the State furnished
free education and textbooks. In 1920
a four to six year education was made
compulsory for all; in 1928 this was
extended to include children between 7
and 15. The 1936 budget gives educa­
tion third place in estimated expendi­
tures, with an allowance of 17J% of the
total. This percentage compares very
favourably with amounts spent by world
powers.
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y EA R BOOK, 1937 71
930 newspapers and journals are
published in Chile, including 93 dailies
and 213 weeklies.
T heosophy in C h ile :
General Secretary, Sr. A r m a n d o
Hamel, 1925-.
History: The two oldest Lodges,
Arundhati in Santiago, and Lob-Nor
in Valparaiso, chartered in April 1902
are still vigorous centres of Theosophy.
The next great impetus to Theosophy
in Chile came in 1909-11 when seven
Lodges were formed. Work in Chile
was under the direction of ftie South
American Presidential Agent until 20
January 1920 when the Section was
chartered with Armando Zanelli M. as
first General Secretary.
The economic crisis somewhat dimin­
ished membership, but the General
Secretary’s report for 1935 shows a
turning pdint and net gain in member»
ship. *
Propaganda', Thebsophy h as an
ample hearing in intellectual circles;
and the general public is showing greater
interest. The library in Santiago is
spreading Theosophy through selling
and lending books. Mr. Krishnamurti
received hospitable reception in Sep­
tember, 1935. The Section has sent a
cordial invitation to President Arundale
and is hoping for a visit in the near
future. The greatest ideal of the Section
is to co-operate for the betterment of
international relationship, particularly
among South American Nations and
the Theosophical movement has had a
strong spiritualizing influence in the
Nation.
CUBA
President o f R e p u b lic: Dr.
Miguel Mariano Gomez y Arias, 20
March 1936-40.
N ational Sum m ary:
Keynote: The spirit of Freedom and
True Democracy.
Cuba is now working under a new
Constitution drafted by President Men-
dietta and his Cabinet, 12 June 1935.
It provides for a four-year term for the
President (without re-election), restores
the Vice-Presidency; gives Representa­
tives 4-year and Senators 8-year terms
of office, and grants votes to women,
Seven women were elected 10 January
1936 as the first Congresswomen in
Cuban history.
Cuba faces a diminishing demand for
its principal crop, sugar, owing to the
greater amounts being produced in its
former best market, the United States.
An attempt to meet the situation was
made by a limitation of raw sugar
production in 1935, through Presiden­
tial Decree.
Cuba is closely in touch with the rest
of the world through 52 long-wave and
2 short-wave broadcasting stations;
direct telephone connections with
American and European cities has been
maintained since 1921. A new and
impressive Central Highway, traversing
the island for 706 miles and costing a
hundred million dollars was opened 24
February 1931. Aliens are granted the
same property and personal rights as
are given to citizens.
Cultural A c tiv itie s:
Education is compulsory and free. In
each province the Government main­
tains a special Institute for advanced
education and normal schools. Univer­
sity instruction is given at the University
of Havana, founded 12 September 1721.
Ninetyfour night schools are maintained.
A feature of the educational system is
the group of 67 travelling teachers who
are teaching in 145 isolated com­
munities without school facilities, 3,089
children.
There is no State Church, though
Roman Catholics predominate.
Theosophy in C uba:
General Secretary : Lorgio Vargas,
1936-. Assisted by a Council of twelve
members, including a Secretary and
Treasurer. In the Section are two Fede­
rations ; The Federation of the Central
Lodges, in charge of Dr. Antolin Garcia;
and the Federation of Oriente and
Camaguey, in charge of Sr. Aatonio
A. Duany.
72 T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
History : In 1884 Don José M. Masso
found Theosophy and with it"a determi­
nation to spread its wisdom in Cuba.
In 1902-3 his hope was realized and the
following Lodges were chartered :
Sophia in Cienfuego (29 Oct, 1902) ;
Concordia (17 Nov. 1902) and Annie
Besant (1903) in Havana. Sophia and
Annie Besant Lodges are still vigorous
centres of Theosophy. Thus was
lighted a Theosophical lamp in Cuba
and its light spread far and wide
throughout Latin America. The
Cuban Section, organized 7 February
1905 with Sr. Masso as the first
General Secretary, started with «
- six
Lodges in Cuba and one in Costa Rica,
but it annexed one Spanish-American
domain after another, until in 1908 it
had 26 Lodges. Rafael de Albear, who
carried on as General Secretary after
the passing of Sr. Masso, continued the
same policy and in 1922 the Cuban
Section included seven countries, be­
sides mothering Mexico and Brazil,
which had become autonomous Sections.
In the early days, freedom of thought
was not permitted and propaganda was
carried on under great difficulties. A
private printing press solved the prob­
lem and the first General Secretary of
necessity became his own printer and
typesetter. An early group was founded
by Jimenez Serrano in 1893, two of
whose members, Dr. Ramón Rogina
Carbonell and Sr. Manuel Janer Román,
are still active workers.
Propaganda: A fine journal The
Cuban Theosophical Review presents
Theosophy to the public, with The
Review Supplement for members.
Pamphlets and leaflets are published.
Close contact with the newspapers is
maintained and much spontaneous
publicity is given. Public conferences
in the important cities are a valuable
means of spreading Theosophy. A
project i% on foot for the foundation of
a Permanent National Theosophical
Camp.
An active Young Theosophist Group
and Theosophical Order of Service
vitalize the Section’s work.
Dr. Besant said in 1923 of Cuba and
the activities of the first two General
Secretaries : 1' Central and South
America . will ultimately form
part of the continent of the seventh
root-race . . . Now the Latin-Ameri­
cans are steadily forging ahead, thanks
at first to the initiative and admirable
services of these two faithful Theos-
ophists, and secondly to the workers
they have gathered round them. The
seed they sowed has sprung up a
hundredfold, and Latin-America will
play a more and more active part in
the progress of humanity.’’
CZECHOSLOVAKIA
President of Republic: Dr. Edvard
Benes, 18 December 1935-42.
National Summary:
Keynote: The understanding of
Democracy as Reverence and Brother­
hood.
The ideal of Democracy was born
in the 15th century in Tabor, where the
people gathered all their jewels in a
vessel and offered them to found a
Community, endeavouring to build it
on selfless intention and spiritual
understanding. In this century also
the Czech-Brothers movement started.
Though the fulfilment of Brotherhood
is not yet perfectly realized, the new
generation is being educated according
to this ideal.
On 28 October 1918 the Czechs of
Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia, and the
Slovaks of Slovakiak, two branches of
the same Slav nation, “ decided of their
own freewill to unite . . . for the
purpose of forming a single sovereign
independent State under the title of the
Czecho-Slovak Republic,” which was
formally recognized by the Allied and
Associated Powers 10 September 1919.
This bloodless revolution, led by the
" Liberator-President,” T. G. Masaryk,
broke the fetters of a 300-year oppres­
sion. Yet so ingrained was the ideal of
Brotherhood that some days after the
revolution, the newly-formed Govern­
ment offered seats in the Convention
Parliament to the German minority.
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 73
The Constitution, passed by the
National Assembly on 29 February 1920,
embodies progressive principles. It
guarantees freedom of the Press and of
speech ; it safeguards racial minorities,
to whom it assures the rhaintenance of
their schools. Privileges derived from
sex, birth or calling are not recognized.
Marriage, the family, and motherhood
are placed under the special pro­
tection of the law. All these guar­
antees and rights are protected by
the Supreme Administrative Court
which sees to the legality of fhe public
administration.
Czechoslovakia is democratic in
administration as well as ideal. The
franchise for the Chamber of Deputies
is open to all citizens over 21, while all
over 30 are eligible for election. The
franchise for the Senate is open to
all citizens over 26 ; and all over 45 are
eligible for election. In the Chamber
of Deputies alone a vote of non-confi­
dence cain compel the resignation of
Government. A measure passed by the
Chamber of Deputies becomes law,
despite an adverse decision of the
Senate, if the Chamber of Deputies
adheres to its first decision by an
absolute majority of all its members.
By 1935, 1,913 estates, involving ten
million acres, or 28.6% of the entire
area, had been redistributed, approxima­
tely half left to original owners, and the
remainder among small proprietors,
national forests, etc. The original
workers on the large estates were given
land grant, employment, or cash com­
pensation. The beloved President
Masaryk resigned at the ripe age of 85,
after having guided his country in
seventeen years of steady constructive
work which won for it the approval of
many nations. He nominated as his
successor his most distinguished disciple'
and lieutenant, Dr. Benes, then foreign
minister, who is rapidly becoming as
popular and as beloved a leader. Dr.
Benes* great ideal is to bring all the
nations of the Danubian Basin into a
league to work out amongst themselves
a system of economic co-operation and
political appeasement. As head of the
State he has continued his policy of
establishing as many cordial relation­
ships as ^possible with neighbouring
and other countries, and is a firm«gup-
porter of the League *asl an adjuster of
differences.
Cultural Activities:
The people are very musical—almost
every child is able to play several instru­
ments. Their artistic nature is also
expressed through handicraft known
in many lands for its beauty. The first
International Congress of Music Educa­
tion was held at Prague 4-9 April, 1936
with eighteen nations represented.
Women have not only complete
equality but have representatives in the
Parliament.
There are many women’s societies
for educational and cultural purposes,
and for social welfare.
Education is compulsory between
6 and 14. There are practically no
illiterates. Many universities and pre­
college schools offer opportunities for
higher education.
There is complete religious freedom,
though the majority of the population is
Catholic. In January, 1920, the re­
formed clergy of Czechoslovakia decided
to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the
Pope and to found a Czechoslovak
Church which has close to a million
adherents.
Theosophy in Czechoslovakia:
General Secretary : Vaclav Cimr.
The seven original Lodges in Prague
(under Section charter 7 February 1909)
each had a distinctive type of Theo-
sophical study and activity to pursue and
were so named : Lodges Occultism ;
Mysticism ; Philosophy and Science ;
Religion, Ethics, Esthetics, Psychic
Studies. The First General Secretary,
Jan Bedrnicek-Chlumsky held office
until 1925.
History : Oscar Beer served 1925-27 ;
Josef Parchansky 1929-31, and the
present General Secretary in 1927-9 and
from 1931. Other pioneers are A. Koch,
Julius Zeyer, Vdclav Prochdzka and
Mrs. Pavla MoudrA.
Propaganda: Some of the meet­
ings are held in beautiful outdoor
spots, drawing the members close to
Nature. ...............
74 T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
Theosophy is also spread through
Esperanto.
Many Theosophical books have been
translated into Czech, and original
Czech work have been written by Mrs.
MoudrA, Dr. Bezdek, Dr. Samalik and
others. Among the active workers are
Viclav Cimr and Oskar Beer.
The chief ideal of the Section is to
keep the Peace in Central Europe.
Member^ see in the '' Small Entente ’ ’
—the brotherhood between Jugosla­
vians, Rumanians, and Czechoslovakians
working in practical co-operation—the
guarantee of Peace. “ We keep the
Fire burning, which can be spread as
the message of Brotherhood and Peace
in Central Europe.” (General Secre-
. tary.) From this country which produced
a John Huss, a Comenius, a T. G.
Masaryk, we may expect the fulfilment
of its pact.
DENMARK
Reigning King: C h r i s t i a n X,
14 May 1912-.
National Summary:
Tolerance, Gentleness, Co-operation,
Silent Strength, and Spiritual In­
dividualism are the national ideals.
In Denmark there are no marked
differences between rich and poor,
upper and lower classes. Even the
Crown was elective until it was rendered
hereditary by right in 1660. There is a
strong democratic tendency in all
classes, though there is great respect
shown for the royal family. The many
years of democratic government have
given the State great influence in Social
problems. Of late a liberal-socialistic
government has been in power. In 1933
Danish social legislation was co-ordin­
ated into four Acts (The Social
Reform). These provide for child
welfare, including half-oiphans, and
unmarried mothers; assistance for
burial, sickness, cripples and the blind ;
old age pensions, etc. Denmark has
abolished poverty in its most intense
forms, also the death penalty. Both
men and women have the franchise
and are eligible for election.
Denmark is one of the motherlands
of the great co-opeative movement
which has brought together producer
and consumer. While gaining much
by virtue of its collective co-operation,
in material things, the spiritual life of
Denmark has a strongly individualistic
character. The people are keenly in­
tellectual, balanced in temperament
with a well-developed sense of humour.
Great tolerance of other races and
peoples is a national characteristic.
The ideas of the League of Nations and
the international judicial principles of
Hague Tribunal have many votaries in
Denmark.
Cultural Activities :
Elementary education has been widely
diffused in Denmark since the beginning
of the ninenteenth century, and in 1814
it was made compulsory for all between
7 and 14. It is free for everyone. The
oldest University, Copenhagen, was.
founded in 1479 ; a Royal Academy
of Arts in 1754 ; a Polytechnic Institu­
tion in 1829. About 40% of university
students are women. Of total
budget 1936-7 16% is allocated to
education. The established religion is
the Lutheran, introduced as early as
1536. However, complete religious,
toleration is extended to every sect.
The Danish language is extraor­
dinarily rich in roots and abounds in
compact and intuitive words for all
natural objects. As one of the mildest
and richest European languages, its
musical softness as well as its clarity
and perspicuity in the expression of
abstract ideas favour its application to
poetry. Soren Kierkegaard, religious
inquirer, Georgr’T M i ^ ^ cntic, and
Harald Hoffding, philosopher, have
international renown ; while the sculptor
Thorvaldsen and Hans Chrisjjan
Affdirseh, story-teller,^are^ffeir”Tom e

In the domain of science the name
of Denmark is frequently mentioned
through such men as Orsted, inventor o f

electro-magnetism ; Valdemar Poulsen,

General Secretary, Ch. Bonde-Jensen,
1935.-
History : Theosophy was introduced
in to Denmark through the Copenhagen
Lodge, chartered in 1893 under the
Scandinavian Section, G. Howitz as
President. The Theoso^Kfcal Society
in Denmark held its first General As­
sembly in 1918, as the Danish-Icelandic
Society; five of the Lodges being
Danish and two Icelandic. The first
General Secretary was the Countess
E. B. B. Selby. A very successful
feature of the original propaganda was
the production at Lodge and public
meetings of really fine music. In 1920
the Section acquired its own Publishing
House. In the same year the Icelandic
Section was formed, leaving the Danish
Section with six Lodges and 360
members. *
Propaganda : All Theosophical activ­
ities, including offices, propaganda, and.
a public library have been centralized at
the fine Headquarter^ in Copenhagen,
recently acquired largely through the-
efforts of Marius Anderson. In 1935 a
Lodge in Odense, the first on the island
Fyen, was formed by C. E. Nielsen.
There is now a growing tendency for
Lodge members to intermingle. Among,
the factors responsible is the Summer
School of the Vikings in Nakskov, the
Centre-Work begun in Manager, in
Jutland, by Theodore Anderson, and
especially the influence of Edwin C.
Bolt for the last six or seven years who-
through his lecture and Lodge work has
not only linked together Scandinavia,
but Scandinavia to other parts of
Europe. It is impossible also to over­
estimate the value to the Danish Section,
of the visit of Mr, 1935
and of the President, Pr»jUmndale*«and
Shrimati RuYmini Devi to Nakskov and
Copenhagen in 1936.
EGYPT
R eign in g K ing : Farouk succeeded
28 April 1936 on death of Fuad I (his
father) Sultan from 9 Oct. 1917, who
took title as King on 15 March 1922 on
termination of British protectorate. King
Farouk will formally accede 7 August
1937 upon attaining his majority.
N ational Sum m ary:
Egypt’s keynote is the heritage of an
age-old past: Peace, and an eternal
certainty of the spiritual verities.
Inner Egypt remains physically as
she has always been spiritually—a bridge
linking Orient and Occident. Just as
the physical records of past ages have
been preserved in the dry desert climate,
so in the changelessness of Egypt’s
spiritual background have been preserved
the records of ancient Atlantis, the
source of its greatness. Even its Gods re­
main unaltered from dynasty to dynasty,
and the despair of archaeologists is to
have to date a statue as belonging to
any particular period.
Modern Egypt, after long subjection '
to foreign powers, has at last attained
her independence. After a brief period
under a British Protectorate (18 Dec.
1914-15—Mar. 1922), she is now wholly
free, though closely watched by all
foreign Powers because of her key posi­
tion as guardian of the Suez Canal.
; In spite of the declared independence
of Egypt, the military occupation by
British troops to guard the Suez Canal
was a source of constant irritation to
the Egyptians, and after many conver­
sations, an Anglo-Egyptian treaty was
negotiated 13 August 1936 which com­
pletely restored to Egypt her dignity as
a self-governing nation, at the same
time safeguarding British interests by
the retention of troops only in the
Canal Zone.
Great strides have been made in the
last decade, particularly along the line
of public health; pure food laws, pre­
vention and control of epidemic disease»
ophthalmic hospitals, control of stupe-
facient drugs, children’s dispensaries,
housing, town planning, etc. Forced
labour has been abolished.
76 T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y EA R BOOK, 1937
On 12 December 1935, King Fuad
signed a decree restoring the' 1923 Con­
stitution to Egypt, making again a con­
stitutional rather than absolute monarchy
of the State. Equal legal, civil and
political rights for all Egyptians, irres­
pective of race, language, or religion and
liberty of religious belief are guaranteed.
The young King Farouk has created a
good impression, starting with a partial
restriction of Royal prerogatives. The
Regents’ Committee announced a new
governmental policy of development of
local industries, agriculture (including
reclamation of waste lands), law control­
ling insurance companies, creation of an
Industrial Credit Bank ; and granted ân
amnesty for all persons convicted of
political crimes, except murder, since
1930. The Egyptian Women’s Union
is active in the political field.
The modern Egyptian is courteous,
affable, with a striking dignity of man­
ner. Filial piety, respect for the aged,
benevolence and charity are conspicu­
ous. Humanity to animals is another
virtue. Cheerfulness and hospitality
are remarkable, as well as frugality and
temperance in food and drink, and
honesty in the payment of debt. Egyp­
tians are very enthusiastic Freemasons.
Cultural Activities :
91 % of the population are Moslems ;
among the Christian sects is the Coptic,
the descendants of those ancient Egyp­
tians who adopted Christianity in the
firstcentury a .d .
The principal seat of Koranic learning
is the Mosque and University of El-
Azhar at Cairo, founded 962 a .d . Its
students come from all parts of the
Mohammedan world ; they pay no fees,
and the professors receive no salaries,
subsisting mainly on fees from private
teaching, copying of manuscripts and
the reciting of the Koran. All over
Egypt are scattered mosque-schools or
kuttabs conducted on similar lines where
pupils are taught to recite portions of
the Koran and learn to read and write
Arabic, and simple arithmetic. Numbers
of these are Government-controlled and
provide a good elementary secular edu­
cation. Education in 1933 was made
compulsory and free for all children
from 7 to 12.
Out of Egypt, now that she is free,
may come a revival of that artistic
creativity !which marked her past genius
for personal portraiture, exquisite per­
fection in the small arts of ivory carv­
ing, gold work, cloisonné inlay, jewel
setting, etc. Still are being mined the
emeralds, turquoise, porphyry, beryls,
and ornamental stones used in ancient
times.
Theosophy in Egypt:
Mme Olga de Lebedeff, L. C. Oltra-
marfc' and Egizio Verbnesi formed the
first Lodge in EgypTT / !90&Jn
Cairo under the name o f T
f É1 Hikmet
El Kadim.” During the Great War,
George Herbert Whyte and other Theos-
ophists stationed for periods in Egypt
gave the movement great impetus, and
16 January 1918 a Section was founded
under the General Secretaryship of
Egizio Veronesi. The Section existed
until 1926, when it became dormant,
and today there is a Federation of
Lodges under J. H. Perez, the last
General Secretary, who is now Presi­
dential Agent. Particular note should be
made of Mrs. Duckworth who for years
was a stalwart worker in Alexandria.
The members are *1standard bearers
still showing the Theosophical flag at
this carrefour between.^Europe-ané-the
Orient,” and between the two hemis­
pheres.

‘ ‘ The great achievement of the last

to terms of democracy and of monarchy,
and the system under which we live

of the Crown has diminished through
the ages, and yet today the spiritual
power of the Crown is not only far
greater than it ever was, but greater
than any man, in vision and in dream,
could have foreseen it. It is not only
the link that holds together our country ;
it holds together the whole Empire of
English-speaking peoples. It is, I be­
lieve, an indissoluble link, and it holds
together the myriad peoples of the East
in that great Indian Empire . . . The
power of the Crown is not today the
power of force, It is a great moral
power and it must depend on the
character and quality of him who sits
on the Throne.” (Prime Minister
Baldwin).
From King George’s Jubilee address:
‘*The Mother of Parliaments and her
children, grown to full estate, stand now
upon equal terms in common allegiance
to the Crown. The unity of the British
Empire is no longer expressed by the
supremacy of the time-honoured Parlia­
ment that sits here at Westminster. The
Crown is the historic symbol that unites
this great family of Nations and Races,
scattered over every quarter of the earth.
The United Kingdom and the Domin­
ions, India, the numerous Colonies
G
and Dependencies, embrace such wide
varieties M speech, culture, and form of
Government as have never beforedn the
world’s history been brought into a
Commonwealth of Peace.
” It is to me a source of pride and
thankfulness that the perfect harmony
of our Constitutional Monarchy has
survived the shocks that have in recent
years destroyed other Empires and other
liberties. Our ancient Constitution,
ever adaptable to change, has during
my Reign faced and conquered perils of
warfare, never conceived in earlier days
and has met and satisfied new demo­
cratic demands, both at home and over­
seas. The system bequeathed to us by
our ancestors, again modified for the
needs of a new age, has been found
once more, as of old, the best way to
secure government by the people, free­
dom for the individual, the ordered
strength of the State, and the rule of
Law over governors and governed
alike. The complex forms and balanced
spirit of our Constitution were not the
discovery of a single era, still less of a
single party or of a single person. They
are the slow accretion of centuries, the
outcome of patience, tradition and ex­
perience, constantly finding channels,
old and new, for the impulse towards
liberty, justice, and social improve­
ment inherent in our people down the
ages . . .”
A Great King passed on the 20th of
January, 1936—George V. For twenty-
five years he had nobly fulfilled his
Coronation Pledge : **To safeguard the
treasures of the past and prepare the
path of the future.” His Majesty’s
Jubilee of 1935 released a flood of love
and devotion from his people. “ First
gentleman in the land, he taught us that
only he who serves can rightly claim
that title . . . his people learned by
countless acts of simple kindness that no
interest, sorrow, or joy of theirs was
outside his thought or too humble for
his sympathy.” (Viscount Halifax).
One of His Majesty’s last conscious
utterances was “ How is the Empire ? ”
and he sank back in relief when his
secretary answered, “ All is well. Sir,
with the Empire*“
78 T H E T H E O S O P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
A Great King will be crowned on the
12th of May 1937. “ To ttfe Throne
he brings a personality richly endowed
with experience of public affairs, with
the fruits of travel and with universal
goodwill. He has the secret of youth in
the prime of age ; he has a wider and
more intimate knowledge of all classes
of his subjects ; not only at home, but
throughout the Dominions and India,
than any of his predecessors.“ (Prime
Minister Baldwin). For many years as
Prince of Wales, His Majesty was
devoted to -the service of his people, to
the relief of distress, and specially to
improving the conditions of England’s
youth. Under King George he was
head of every national movement for the
relief of sickness, suffering and want.
He not only travelled widely throughout
the Empire, but visited also The United
States and the South American Re­
publics, everywhere mixing freely with
men of all races and classes, and be­
coming affectionately known as the
**Ambassador Prince. ’’ As soon as possi­
ble after His Majesty’s coronation he
is planning an air tour of the Empire.
The British Commonwealth of
Nations:
Within the protection of the British
Empire are half a billion people of every
race and clim e: some older races, as
is India, the Mother Nation , others
younger as in Europe, America, and
Australia. Many of these peoples have
been brought within the world-encircling
fold of the Empire through conquest
to protect commercial interests; many
have voluntarily sought its protection ;
many have been put under the care of
the Empire through mandate of the
League of Nations.
We must look deeper than external
causes for the linking together of one-
fourth of the world’s two thousand million
(2,055,732,850) inhabitants under the
protectorate of a single Empire covering
over one-fourth of the continental popu­
lated area of the globe. One sees there
the beginning of a World Confederation
in the linking of East and West, North
and South, with the stronger bond of
unity than any league of warring
interests can hope to achieve.
There is a growing tendency in colo­
nial policy to give Self-Government as
quickly and in as great a measure as
the welfare of the protected nation
warrants. Dominions are granted equal
status with the Mother Country.
This policy was stated in 1926 by a
committee on inter-imperial relations,
defining the ‘' position and mutual rela­
tion ’ ’ of Great Britain and the domin­
ions : “ They are autonomous Com­
munities within the British Empire,
equal in status, in no way subordinate
one to another in any aspect of their
domestic or external affairs, though
united by a common allegiance to the
Crown and freely associated as mem­
bers of the British Commonwealth of
Nations . . Every self-governing
member of the Empire is now the
master of its destiny. In fact, if not
always in form, it is subject to no
compulsion whatever The
British Empire is not founded on nega­
tions. It depends essentially, if not
formally, on positive ideals. Free in­
stitutions are its life-blood. Free co­
operation is its instrument. Peace,
security and progress are among its
objects . And though every do­
minion is now, and must always remain,
the sole judge of the nature and extent
of its co-operation, no common cause
will, in our opinion, be thereby im­
perilled.”
Great Britain with a broad vision of
world equilibrium has steadfastly worked
for the Collective Security of all the
nations of the world and has courag­
eously attempted to maintain peace both
within and without her borders. A
Chilean demonstration recently paid
fine tribute to Great Britain for her
persistent endeavours to support weak
nations, maintain respect for interna­
tional rights, and serve the cause of
world peace.” Holding these ideals,
Great Britain has been one of the
greatest stabilizing forces tm world
history.
The British Nation silently and yet
surely progresses, avoiding on the one
hand great booms, and on the other
great depressions. A realistic people,
they have kept the British budget
79
T H E TH EO SO P H ICAL Y EA R BOOK, 1937
strictly balanced through adequate
taxation. One of the first nations to
reduce salaries, Great Britain was also
one of the first to restore them to the
original levels, and is ,now leading the
world in economic recovery.
Yet throughout a generation a magnif­
icent system of social security has been
built, including Unemployment In­
surance, National Health Insurance,
Widows, Orphans and Old Age Con­
tributory Pensions, Maternity and Child
Welfare, etc. During the difficult period
of world depression, many unique
methods were adopted to “ save the self-
respect of our fellow-countrymen," while
still insuring a subsistence through un­
employment allowances. The “ occupa­
tional club " —of which there are some
1,500 throughout the country—was
started in hard-hit towns, villages or
districts, and employed and unemployed
alike played and worked together,
building swimming baths, playing fields,
children^ playgrounds, nursery schools,
and in general working for the upbuild­
ing of the community, thus ‘ ‘ preventing
the demoralization and feeling of hope­
lessness and helplessness which results
from lack of work."
In the greatly depressed areas,
rehabilitation is being accomplished
through reorganization of the coal, iron,
and steel industries, special aid, em­
ployment regulation, and in general the
effort is (l) To create a revival of
industry in the area (through award of
Government contracts, etc.) ; (2) To bring
new industries to the- area ; and (3) To
take people where industry is.
A vast programme of housing and
slum clearance has been in progress
since 1932, with the result that in 1936
46% of all working-class families were
so well housed that the number of
persons in each family could be doubled
without overcrowding. Within seven
years the present programme will clear
London of all slums. Manufacturing
satellite towns are being carefully
planned.
Industry has been assisted where
necessary by subsidies, and on the other
hand carefully controlled and regulated.
An example of this was the undertaking
in 1936 qf gradual reorganization of the
electricity supply with a view to accom-
plish in fifty years ultimate public
ownership of all the suppj^r, retaining
and utilizing the larger and more
efficient existing undertakings and
absorbing the smaller and less efficient.
An important 1936 reform was the
elimination of the tithe rent-charge, the
State compensating for Church losses.
Great progress has been made in
dealing with offenders against the laws
of the land. Committals for drunken­
ness fell from 54,452 in 1910-11 to 6,838
in 1934; local prisons 56 in 1910, 26
noft ; annual receptions 186,395 in 1910
to 56,425 in 1934, and the daily average
population from 20,826 to 12,238.
Special attention has been given the
young offender, attempting to educate
and raise his standard of life rather than
frighten and embitter him. The work-
less are trained in centres for future
employment, local Government is taught
and' every effort made to inculcate true
citizenship. The Juvenile Courts have
been made most informal. The young
offender meets a friendly group of men
and women in a pleasant room, with a
complete avoidance of such terms as
" conviction " and “ sentence " and a
careful protection of the names of
offenders in custody. As a result the
number of lads sentenced to imprison­
ment has fallen from 9,891 in 1910 to
1,894 in 1934. In adult prisons, some
unique experiments are in progress in
which selected men are given outside
group agricultural work under minimum
supervision. A cafeteria meal service,
brighter dresses and many other
‘‘ humanizing ’ ’ reforms are in progress
for mental hospitals.
Great emphasis is laid upon youth.
This is exemplified in the growth of
the world Scout Movement under Lord
Baden Powell; the King George Jubilee
Trust which was used to assist existing
juvenile organizations of proved worth ;
and in the King George Memorial,
consisting of National playing fields
throughout the country, each with a
gateway designed by an eminent
architect and engraved %ith the late
King’s name.
THÉ THEOSOPHICAL YEAR BOOK, 1937
S
O
King Edward on 3 November 1936
inaugurated a Physical Fitness Cam­
paign, the aim of which is to provide
gymnasiums in every town in the
country; thousands of additional swim­
ming pools: more open spaces and
sports fields, together with intensive
propaganda to educate the nation in
physical \fitness and the facilities of
Britain’s existing health services—a
project in which the King has always
taken a close personal interest. Sports­
manship add fair play have always been
the mark of the British.
Cultural A ctivities :
For several years the tendency of r e ­
ligiou s bodies to amalgamate for greater
strength and unity has been developing.
In 1936 two great bodies of Christian
fellowship—the World Alliance for In­
ternational Friendship through the
Churches and the British Christian
Social Council (representing the uni­
versal Christian Council for Life and
Work) became one body under the title
of the British Christian Council for
International Friendship, Life, and
Work, which union has the support of
the governing bodies of all the Churches.
This Council is vitally interested in
world peace, and economic and social
questions. London acted as host in July
1936 to the World Congress of Faiths,
which met to consider the remedies to
be found in each religion for present-day
problems.
There are many signs of a widespread
awakening of interest in all the A rts,
as the following facts indicate :
(1) So popular was the Exhibition of
Chinese Art held in London in 1935
that it was decided to hold an exhibition
of the Eumorfopoulos Collection of
Chinese Art at the Victoria and Albert
Museum ; during the first week, there
were 5,000 visitors.
(2) Some months ago the Anglo-
French Art and Travel Society was
formed to promote the social intercourse
of people interested in art and travel in
the two countries. Facilities are afforded
to members to meet one another in.
Paris and London and reciprocal pro­
grammes are arranged. Russia sends
the famous Moscow ballet as an am­
bassador to aid in cultural rapproche­
ment. There is frequent interchange
of students between Germany and Eng­
land. The culture of India was repre­
sented in the opening of the first Indian
Bank in Britain with a religious cere­
mony. India is building in London
a Hindu Temple, the lack of which has
prevented many Indians from visiting
the British Isles. Two centuries of Brit­
ish Art were shown at the Municipal
Museum at Amsterdam and opened by
the Duke# of Kent in July 1936. The
Canadian Government Memorial which
the King opened at Vimy in July 1936
will always remain a cultural link be­
tween Europe and the British Empire»
(3) A Picture Lending Society (or
Library) has been founded in London
through which well known artists loan
pictures for a very small sum per month,
thus distributing art broadcast through
the nation.
(4) Craftsmanship, music and drama
have been stimulated through the occu­
pational clubs, where unemployed and
employed meet for comradeship and
mutual assistance ; in the schools a
stimulation to crafts and arts education
—spinning, weaving, woodwork, metal-,
work, pottery, modelling, painting,
carving, sculpture, embroidering is being
initiated ; in Birmingham the British
Industries Fair opened 17 February
1936 showed the products manufactured
by fifteen Empire countries, the ex­
hibit from India being specially at­
tractive.
The eightieth birthday of George
Bernard Shaw was celebrated 25th July
1936 at Malvern where he personally
rehearsed three of his plays. Drama
mourns the loss of Sir Henry Lytton on
the 16th of August. He was the only
Savoy actor to share with Gilbert and
Sullivan tike honour of a knighthood
and retired in 1934 after celebrating his
stage jubilee.
No word about the art of Britain
would be complete without mention of
her gardens. The English are flower-
lovers, and in addition to home-culled
blossoms spend ¿15,000,000 a year for
flowers or one-third of what the entire
population spends on the cinema.
81
THE THEOSOPHICAL YEAR BOOK, 1937
In the last decade (1924-34) there has
been a 76,8% increase in the population
served by public libraries, a 144.8%
increase in books issued annually; a
108.2% increase in stock of books and a
198.2% increase of registered readers for
home-reading only.
A spelling reform has been started in
the United Kingdom so that English,
one of the simplest languages in gram­
matical structure, may be more available
as a world language.
Two great writers passed in 1936 :
Rudyard Kipling was interred 23 Jan­
uary in the Poet’s Corner of West­
minster Abbey in a grave adjacent to
those of Dickens and Hardy ; and on
14th of June passed G. K. Chesterton,
novelist and biographer.
In the field of A rch a eology, Maiden
Castle, the great prehistoric earthwork
near Dorchester, is yielding many valu­
able relics of Roman and pre-Roman eras.
In the realm of m usic the Autumn
of 1935 witnessed two important events :
the first complete performance of
William Walton’s First Symphony,
that is, its fourth movement was heard
for the first time ; and the first hearing
of Arnold Bax’s Sixth Symphony.
A critic writes of Walton’s work :
first movement— 4*an impression of
powerful energy ” ; ‘ *dynamic inven­
tions *’ in the scherzo ; beauty emerged
from the elaborate adagio; and the
finale "suggests barbaric jubilation.’ ’
Clearly this work, like Vaughan
Williams’ 1934 Symphony in F minor,
is post-bellum music. The listener
receives an impression of music which
is vividly alive, and yet there is no
repose in it. The mere act of listening
demands a distinct effort.
But it is not alone large-scale works
which the musical public has been
offered ; mention must be made of a
comic opera by Vaughan Williams set
to a libretto by Evelyn Sharp—1' The
Poisoned Kiss,’ ’ and of Arthur Bliss’s
4’ Music for String Orchestra. ’ ’
In a brilliant season at Covent Garden,
Mme Kirsten Flagstad, a new Isolde
with a beautiful voice, won many hearts.
In less expensive way those who love
music have been catered fo r ; the
" Foundations of Music " item which is
broadcast* at 6.30 on week-nights has
revived less known music such*as that
of Monteverde, Schiitte, William Byrd,
etc., affording some twenty minutes of
rare pleasure nightly. The South Place
Sunday Concerts are being continued
in a modern concert hall. And the
1225th of the series was given on 6th
October 1935 ; chamber music is the
speciality. No reference to English
music would be complete without men­
tion of the annual Promenade Concerts
at Queen’s Hall conducted by Sir Henry
Wood which have been enthusiastically
received by music lovers for the past
thirty years.
The B.B.C. arranged two musical
items of special interest: a complete
performance of Purcell’s music to Dry-
den’s masque " King Arthur ” ; and a
rendering of Berlioz’s " Grande Messe
des Morts, ’ ’ which requires four bands
for its performance.
Turning for a moment to Jazz—it
would seem that all attempt at melody
has now been flung to the winds in the
latest ' ‘ productions ’ ’ ; a jazz record
now consists of a series of shouts, yells
and howls, with intermittent and cat­
like miaowing, against an accompani­
ment of saxaphones, guitars, etc. The
effect is shattering.
A notable and difficult achievement
of 1936 was the capture of bird songs
in their natural haunts ; now for the
first time can be heard beautiful repro­
ductions on records of the nightin­
gale, blackbird, and other British
songsters
Definite progress has been made in
the science of T elevision, and the first
high-definition broadcast of Television
took place 25th August 1936 from
Alexandra Palace to Olympia. A wireless
triumph is the discovery that ultra-short
waves used in television are capable of
reflection in lower layers of atmosphere
which will greatly extend the possible
range of television transmission from
fifty miles as a rough limit for effective
reception to inter-Continental distances
with sufficiently powerful transmitters.
A mobile Television Station will televize
the Coronation Procession.
82 T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
The year 1935-6 noted a consolidation
and expansion of previous wofk in Sci­
enceand a tendency to review theories in
the light of newly discovered facts rather
than many startling discoveries. The re­
cognition of the inadequacy of current
theories of variation and heredity at the
Royal Society’s Meeting, May 1936, is
significant. Striking advances have been
made in the field of twentieth century
alchemy, namely the transmutation of
large numbers of chemical elements,
resulting in the artificial synthesis of
new, aS well as old, types of matter.
Many of these synthetic elements show
radioactive properties comparable with
those of the natural radio-elements*
spontaneously disintegrating after long
or short periods of life into other lighter
elements. The achievement of transmuta­
tion in the laboratory may well indicate
that the modern scientist can not only
analyze matter but can reproduce on a
small scale the creative processes by
which the material universe was built.
The most outstanding tendency in
Medicine in 1935 was the change in the
official view on the question of com­
pulsory vaccination against smallpox.
A report of a Committee on Investigation
in the British Medical Association makes
the definite conclusion that the retention
of the Vaccination Acts at present in
force serves no useful purpose. A
further indication of the trend in Medi­
cine is found in the inauguration of the
Health Education and Research Coun­
cil, a body international, dissociated
from experiments on animals, three of
whose main objects are :
“ The study of the laws of health
and their application to individual,
occupational and social life.”
*‘ The critical investigation of the
results of prevalent medical theories
and practices, of laboratory research
and experiments on animals and human
beings, recorded in medical and scient­
ific journals, of operations and treat­
ment in hospitals and asylums, of
statistics in relation to preventive and
curative treatment, of injury and death
caused by vaccination and inoculation.”
The encouragement and support of
methods of healing which are dissociated
from experiments on animals such as
Homoeopathy, Herbalism, Nature Cure,
Physiotherapy in its various forms,
Hydrotherapy, Osteopathy, manipula­
tive treatment, light-ray and wireless-
wave therapy, vegetarian and fruitarian
systems of dietetics, Psychotherapeut­
ics.”
Another important tendency in re­
search has been the growing recognition
of the danger of the repeated use of
anaesthetics. There are signs that the
medical profession in England is begin­
ning to rebognize the importance of the
flow of vitality in the physical body.
Research scientists recognize what is
called the electrical field of the body,
and experiments are being made on
forces which disturb this field as well as
enhance its healthy activity
Among the most important and far-
reaching developments are those in the
field of education : an extensive ten-
year programme involves improved
provision for technical and art education ;
grant for new elementary school
buildings raised from 20 to 50% from
1st January 1936 ; grant towards school
transport increased from 20 to 40% ;
more nursery schools for children up to
five years of age ; further development
of adult education ; improved school
medical services ; schemes of physical
education covering all types of schools ;
extension of 44special places '' awards
in grant-aided secondary schools. This
programme is linked up with legislation
raising the school-leaving age by law
and necessitating accommodation for
more children. Teachers have received
improved standards of pay as from 1st
April 1936.
Beauty is a keynote in the new
luxury schools, brightly-coloured walls
with desks to match, large airy rooms,
tall wide windows, radio equipment in
every classroom and assembly hall.
Twenty courses in English and two in
Welsh (ten special from Scottish
stations) are given each week over the
radio, including travel talks, English
literature, history, German, nature
Study, biology, gardening, etc. ; 3,820
schools are on the radio register. A big
film project is making use of educational
T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 83
silent and '‘ talkie ’ ’ cinemas covering
geography, physics, biology, natural
history, and physical education.
Special attention is paid to education
in agricultural areas, and the Ministry
of Agriculture offers to sons or daughters
of land or rural workers, or workers on
the land, 130 junior and 10 senior
scholarships, the most coveted of which
provide for degree courses at Cambridge
or Oxford with generous outfit allowance
and living expenses for three or four
years.
School curricula are being carefully
revised and the whole system of com­
petitive examinations with intensive
special preparation is challenged by
school authorities. Week end and
Sunday homework has been abolished
by the Board of Education. The
country is keenly alive to the need for
radical changes in the educational
system and among suggestions advanced,
one notable idea is that of Sir Richard
Livingstone to the British Association
who advocates the sandwich system of
part work and part school after
adolescence, contending: “ At present
life is so arranged that most of us do
our thinking in youth at an age when
we are not best fitted for it, and having
left the university think, systematically,
no more.” Youth is trained for citizen­
ship and many youth organizations are
keenly interested in governmental
affairs. Education is given for peace,
and history is taught without partisan
colouring that gives to the conqueror
the guise of *‘ hero ’’ and to the con­
quered the mask of “ ruffian.”
The New London University build­
ings in Bloomsbury were occupied 17
August 1936, though the ten acres of
buildings of a monumental character,
which are intended to last for hundreds
of years, with architecture on a scale
grander than St. Paul’s, will take
thirty years to complete. By 1940 the
site will be half covered ; the buildings
are designed to be completed in units.
In the realm of A dventure an out­
standing achievement was the England-
Capetown-England flight of Mrs. Amy
Mollison in seven days, 22 hours, and
43 minutes in May 1936, breaking all
records. Miss Jean Batten on Oct. 11
broke the*solo flight record England to
Australia by 24 hours and 16 minutes.
After an initial failure, The Queen
Mary wrested the ‘ 1Blue Riband of the
Atlantic ’’ from the Normandie for the
fastest westward and eastward passages
on the 23rd and 31st August 1936, the
America-Europe passage being complet­
ed in 3 days, 23 hours, 57 minutes.
W om anhood has high esteem in Brit­
ain. Not only has suffrage been won,
but a full contractual equality is being
established. By order of King Edward
VIII the statutes of the Royal Victorian
Order were altered in May, 1936, so
that women might be awarded this
honour. Queen Mary was made the
first woman G.C.V.O.
Theosophy in England:
Mrs. Adelaide Gardner, General Sec­
retary, 1936-. Treasurer, Henry S. L.

is in the hands of the National Council,
Executive Committee and General
Secretary. The National Council con­
sists of the General Secretary, the
Treasurer, the Presidents, and Secre­
taries of Federations and one repre­
sentative per 100 members duly elected
by that Federation every three years, and
members of the Executive Committee
who do not represent Federations. The

History : Great interest in occultism
led C,.C, Jdassey, an English barrister,
to New York to investigate the phenom­
ena being produced by HelenaPetrov-
na Blavat§ky. He became one of the
sixteen original formers of The Theoso-
phical Society iirNew York l7 Novem-
ber 1875, and upon his immediate return
to England gathered around him an
informal group for the study of Theos­
ophy. On a visit to England, 27 June
1878, John Storer Cobb, Treasurer of
The Society, was^ authorized to form
this little group ‘ into “ The British
Theosophical Society ” with C. C. Mas­
sey, President, and Emily Kislingbury,
Secretary. Great names associated with
England’s early Theosophical history
are Sir Alfred Russel Wallace, Sir
William Crookes, Prof. Stainton Moses,
«4 T H S TH E O SO PH ICA L Y EA R BOOK, 1937
etc. In 1883 under the presidentship
of Dr. Anna Bonus Kingsford* the name
was changed to the " London Lodge.”
In September of the same year, as
Mother Lodge of the British Isles,
London was officially authorized to
endorse charters coming from the United
Kingdom,
of the Yii
who h&d
to Theosophy in India, became President
of the London Lodge and was the pillar
of the Lodge for many years.
Great impetus 4o the work in the
British Isles came with the arrival of
Madame Blavatsky, who had been
engaged in writing The Secret Doctrine,
in Europe. Lucifer was started Sep-
tember , 1887, 2S^~also the Blavatsky
ttfSge,meeting in Madame Blayatsky’s
home, 17 Lansdowne Road. From this
tnfftr f or t ? f t h e Lodges
in England, and London particularly,
was steady. The President-Founder
formally chartered the British Section,
19 October 1888, at a meeting attended
by delegates from the two Lodges in
London, and Liverpool, Dublin, Cam­
bridge and Glasgow Lodges. In October
1889, W.R. Old became the first General
Secretary. Much stimulus was given
to the Section by the lectures of Mrs.
Besant, who had joined The Society in
May of that year.
In July, 1890, Madame Blavatsky
moved from 17 Lansdowne Road, to
19 Aveniie Road, St John's Wood,
which“ became* the Headquarters of the
European Section as well as of the
Blavatsky Lodge. The new Hall was
the first Theosophical building in
Europe. Under the supervision of the
Countess Wachtmeister, lending librar­
ies were established in various places,
and hundreds of thousands of leaflets
and pamphlets were distributed all over
the country, this constituting the first
Theosophical propaganda in Britain.
During the next few years the work,
under Mrs. Besant and other leading
workers, went on steadily. In 1900
Bertram Keightley, the General Secre­
tary, reported that the membership
figure stood at 1,680. These few years
paw the output of much standard litera­
In 1885, A. P. Sinnett, one

rendered inesfimàhlè^Tüpport
ture, including some of Mrs. Besant's
best known Convention Addresses and
Mr. Leadbeater’s Man, Visible and
Invisible and The Other Side of
Death.
The passing of Madame Blavatsky,
8 May 1891, welded Ï
tffSFé^eToselÿ together in a common pur­
pose, and her many trained workers
nobly carried on the work of Theos-
ophizing Europe. In fact so many
Lodges had been formed in Europe
under the jurisdiction of the British
Section, that it was rechartered 17 July
1891 as “ The European Section,” and
was so reported until 1905, when
owing to the formation of autonomous
sections in Sweden, Holland, France,
Italy, and Germany, it again returned to
the title of “ The British Section,” to be
so known until the formation of autono1
mous Sections, Scotland 1910, Ireland
1919, and Wales 1922, made the name
44English Section ’' the only logical
one. England still shares with France
the mothering of unattached Europte&n
Lodges.
The years immediately preceding and
following the election of Dr. Besant as
President of The Society show great
activity. The Section journal was The
Vahan. Gut of the Bureau of Theo­
sophical Activities, of which Dr. Wedg­
wood was secretary, grew the Propag­
anda, later the Publicity Department,
and Summer Schools. In 1911 there
were 51 Lodges and 23 Centres in Eng­
land and Wales, and the activities of the
Section had so greatly increased that
a Propaganda Sub-Committee was form­
ed to organize and conduct the publicity
work. During this year it was hoped
to take possession of the magnificent
building, now the Headquarters of the
British Medical Association, which was
in course of erection. This dream, how­
ever, was unrealized. In 1912 the
membership exceeded 2,000, and the
next year found England and Wales
divided into three federated areas.
In 1915-16 Dr. Arundal&was General
Sécmejtgiv^anïï"Tfëndereâ great sëndceto
the~ Secfem by putting the various de­
partments, sociological, educational,
and so on, under experts. By 1917 thé
T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L YEAR BOOK, 1937 85
number of Lodges was more than double
the 1911 figure; for though the war
claimed its toll and conditions were
naturally adverse to development, yet
the interest aroused by the Theosophi-
cal teaching on life afteir death was very
great, 1918 showing the ¿lreatest.net
increase in" membership.
During the next few years the inter­
national aspect of the work became
marked. Many General Secretaries
passed through London, and demands
for literature were constant, particularly
for use in the Balkan countries. Another
feature of The Society’s work in Eng­
land was the co-operation in various
ways with many similar movements,
religious, social and international.
These years saw an increased ten­
dency also to encourage study, by
the holding of more Study Classes,
Students’ Week-ends, and Study Weeks
in all the Federation areas. By this
time also the movement had begun to
interest many young people, hence a
Youth Lodge and the Young Theos-
ophists Association.
An outstanding feature of these years
was the annual and eagerly awaited
visit of the President. The Convention
of 1926 was the largest ever held in
England. In 1930, for the first time for
twenty-four years, Bishop Leadbeater
visited England, and Dr. Besant being
also there, the two august figures appear­
ed together on the Convention platform.
The various internal and external prob­
lems now confronting members resulted
in a loss of membership, and these years
are records of the adjustments to doubts
and difficulties on the part of many of
those remaining. In 1934, the Section
acquired, as a permanent home, attrac­
tive, dignified and very central freehold
premises at 50, Gloucester Place, Lon­
don, W. 1.
An outstanding event of 1936 was
the Annual Convention, held at Whit­
suntide, the first to be held in the new
Besant Hall, which was dedicated by
the President 4' not to the memory but
to the ever-living presence of a great
leader.” The Blavatsky Lecture was
delivered by D&.Arundale on"""* Xha.
Foundations of Practical”Occultism.”
Following this, the President and Shri-
mati Rdkmini D
Conference in
Manchester, stimulating all they met
to a greater endeavour and more intense
purpose in the work.
Propaganda : The commodious pre­
mises of the National Headquarters
afford excellent accommodation for
the various administrative departments.
On the ground floor are situated the
Inquiry Office, a charming room for
members, where tea is served in the
afternoon, and a small lecture hall
capable of seating about 150. The
first floor is given over to the Lend­
ing and Reference Libraries where
10,000 volumes are housed in three
large rooms upon readily accessible
shelves. The General Secretary’s and
other offices are on the upper floor.
The Besant Hall seats an audience of
450. The whole building is charmingly
decorated, and is a dignified centre from
which to represent Theosophy to the
English nation and the heart of the
Empire.
The Publicity Department issues an­
nually a Year Book and Diary, giving
particulars of every Lodge and Centre
in the British Isles. It also describes
the organization of the Section. The
Department publishes pamphlets and
issues to Lodges a specially prepared
poster on which Lodges overprint local
particulars of lectures, etc. One valu­
able result of this is that the special
poster has acquired a quite definite
publicity value. The supply of leaflets
for resale or free distribution has proved
very valuable as an introduction to the
more serious study of Theosophical
literature. Perhaps the most important
work is the arranging from Headquarters
of lecture tours. In autumn 1935 about
400 lectures were arranged.
One of the greatest services that the
English Section has rendered to Theos­
ophy has been to provide two Presidents
of the Society (Dr. Annie Besant and
Dr. George S. Arundale) besides Bishop
Leadbeater and many of the Interna­
tional lecturers.
" The Society is standing for peace
and goodwill wherever and whenever
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L YEA R BOOK, 1937
possible and many Lodges as a part of
their regular work hold meditations for
peace and understanding . . . It is
hoped that our Section may play its
part in the re-emphasis and revival of
the spiritual life as a practical contri­
bution to meeting the needs of the world
today ” (General Secretary).

FINLAND
President o f Republic : Dr. Pehr
Evind Svinhufvud, 16 February 1931-7.
National Summary: *
Keynote: "Mysticism, devotion*
Spirit of Freedom." (G.S.A.)
Finland stands as a bridge between
Nordic and Slav nations and cultures.
Through many years of association with
Sweden, the Swedish language, religion
and culture became inextricably blended
in the national consciousness. In 1809
came union with Russia as an autono­
mous Grand Duchy, and from this time
on we can speak of the development of a
Finnish nation and a Finnish culture.
On 6 December 1917 Finland proclaimed
itself an independent and sovereign
State. The nation today is stressing
nationalism.
After gaining her independence, Fin­
land adopted laws which with certain
limitations gave tenants the opportunity
of purchasing their holdings at a price
below their value in the open market,
and a large number of tenants have thus
become small owners. This active
policy of improving the position of the
landless agricultural population had
been set on foot before the World War.
The co-operative movement has made
considerable progress in Finland.
A remarkable system of lakes connec­
ted with each other and with the Gulf
of Finland by canals yields 3,000 miles
of navigable and 23,000 miles of
floatable waterways for internal com­
munications.
Women have had suffrage in Finland
since 1906, and they are very active in
national affairs. One of the many
women’s associations, tfye Suomen
Naisyhdistys, has as its ideal, besides
the improvement of the status of
women, the raising of the standard of
education and the bringing of women
into contact with modern thought,
social work, and the duties of citizenship.
The prison system is progressive.
Children are dealt with in juvenile
courts.
Financial considerations have limited
the scope of actual legislation for social
insurance, but workmen’s compensation
for accidents was put on a comprehen­
sive basis by legislation in 1917 and
1925.
The Finnish people have been charac­
terized as having great strength,
stability, simplicity, as being earnest,
thoughtful, with a hunger for knowledge,
nature-loving, athletic, dramatic, musi­
cal, and artistic. Runeberg stresses their
patriotism, loyalty to legal government,
endurance, trustfulness, spirit of strong
comradeship.
Cultural Activities:
The National Church is the Evangeli­
cal Lutheran, but entire liberty of
conscience is guaranteed to members
of all religions. Obligatory educa­
tion has existed in Finland only
since 1921 ; but owing to the zeal of the
Lutheran Clergy, most persons for the
last 200 years have been able to read,
and in 1930 over 99% of adults over 15
were literate. Finland’s premier uni­
versity, now in Helsinki, was founded in
1640 at Turku. There are also a
Swedish University (1911) and a Finnish
University (1922) with many secondary
schools of high standard.
The Kalevala Festival Centenary 28
February 1935 celebrated the first
edition of Finland’s great national epic.
TH E TH EO SO PH ICAL YEAR BOOK, 1937 87
gathered by Dr. Elias Lonnrot from the
lips of the peasantry. This edition
contains 12,000 lines exactly as he
heard them sung or chanted. In 1849
a new edition of 22,793 verses in fifty
runes was published. Longfellow built
his Hiawatha on the metre of these
beautiful folk-songs.
Music from the “ land of a thousand
lakes '’ has a poignant and haunting
appeal. Jan Sibelius takes his place
among the foremost masters as an inter­
preter of the spirit of Finland in his
sombre and intensely individual sym­
phonies and songs. Since 1897 the
State has honoured him with a life-
grant. Other Finnish composers of
note have been Toivo Kuula, Erkki
Melartin, F.T.S., Oskar Merikanto,
F.T.S. (who composed among other
works a Theosophical symphony), Armas
Jarnefelt, Selim Palmgren, and A.
Launis.
Theosophy in Finland:
General Secretary, Armas Rankka,
1931-.
History : Theosophy reached Finland
through the Swedish newspapers of
1891, the first printed treatise in Finnish
h^ing that of Prof. Grotenfelt published
in 1894. A year earlier some Finns at
Helsingfors founded'a Lodge, which
was attached to the Scandinavian
Section. Lectures on Theosophy were
delivered from 1901. In 1903 a Theo­
sophical Publishing Company was form­
ed, and in 1915 registered. As soon
as the legal right to form a Section
was obtained in 1905, the members
worked vigorously, and on 21 October
1907 the Section was chartered with
Pekka Ervast as first General Sec­
retary. The Section grew rapidly,
adding five new Lodges in 1908, and
developed valuable literary and artistic
activities, mining the rich store of
occult lore in the mystic traditions of
Finland. The translation into Finnish
of The Secret Doctrine was begun
in 1911 by Mr. Ervast, and though
dropped for a period is now being
continued in the pages of Teosofi by
Dr. Angervo.
Finland can claim with the formation
of its Theosophical Young People’s
Association in 1911 one of the first youth
organizations in The Society. The
Section has weathered successfully
several upheavals ; among them the
surrender of the fine Headquarters in
1933 because of financial difficulties, but
the work was soon reorganized and the
Section is now one of the most vigorous.
Names that stand out in Section history
are Pekka Ervast, Dr. Angervo, Vaino
Valvanne and Dr. Sonck.
Propaganda : For many years the
Section has been active in free distribu­
tion of Theosophical literature. Since
1928 a Summer School has brought the
members together. During the 1936
Summer School at Kaunianen over half
the Section membership gathered to
hear the President and Shrimati Ruk-
mini Devi. Theosophy as Beauty has
long been emphasized in Finland through
choruses and choirbands of Theos-
ophists. Especially was Beauty empha­
sized by the performance at the 1935
Convention of the Mystery Play Kauko-
mieli written by Willie Angervo on the
Kalevala motive.
FRANCE
President of the R e p u b l i c :
Albert Lebrun, 10 May 1932-9.
National Summary:
Keynote : 1‘ The Spirit of Individual­
ity, of emotional and intellectual bril­
liance.” (G.S.A.).
France has been torn for years be­
tween the attempt to maintain the gold
standard and balance a Budget in a
currency-devaluated world, to maintain
what was considered an adequate
national defence for security, and to
alleviate the sufferings of a large number
of unemployed. Cabinet after Cabinet
in rapid succession has attacked one
angle of the problem, to be succeeded
in a few months by another Government
whose emphasis was laid on another
angle. Among the fifteen Cabinets in
the period 1932-36 two stand out for
H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
longevity : the 1933 Daladier and the
1934 Doumergue Governments, each
lasting for nine months» or two months
longer than the average duration of a
French Cabinet in the past sixty years.
The Daladier Cabinet laid emphasis on
economy ; in the 1
*truce ’’ Doumergue
Cabinet all the ex-Premiers in Parlia­
ment worked with the ex-President of
France, who was drafted by the
people to bring “ truce, appease­
ment and justice " into the political
situation!
The emphasis of the present Coalition
Government of Radicals, Socialists and
Communists, Léon Blum, Prime Minis­
ter, is upon social reform, and from
June 4, 1936 “ New Deal Mlegislation
includes :
A series of labour laws which suc­
ceeded in adjusting a difficult strike
epidemic that had brought the industrial
life of Paris and other important centres
almost to a standstill. (This legislation
granted the right of workers to belong
to trade unions, to permit delegates in
the shops, the 40-hour week, yearly
paid vacations, the right of collective
contracts.)
For the first time in history the
appointment of women in the French
Cabinet : Mme Irene Joliot-Curie,
Under-Secretary for Scientific Research
(since resigned) ; Mme Suzanne Lacorre
for Child Welfare ; and Mme Léon
Brunschveig for Education.
A Bank Reform Bill, which “ demo­
cratizes " France’s central bank of issue,
giving the voting power, hitherto held
only by the 200 largest, to all stock­
holders, and transforms the governing
body of the bank from the present Coun­
cil of Regents into a General Council
consisting of representatives of industry,
agriculture and the trade unions ; the
Governor and two Vice-Governors to be
appointed by the State.
A National Wheat Board was estab­
lished to " organize French wheat pro­
duction on rational lines and to guarantee
farmers a remunerative price for their
products." Co-operative marketing is
stressed.
Control of the price of coal by the
Minister of Mines.
Nationalization of the armament in
dustry under strict Governmental con­
trol.
Abolition of the notorious Devil's
Island in French Guiana as a penal
institution.
A programme of public works costing
¿260,000,000 spread over four years, to
be devoted to agricultural and rural
needs, to schemes for bringing drinking
water and electricity to the countryside,
reafforestation, modernization of school
buildings, etc.
A realignment of currency between
France, the United States and the
United Kingdom.
A reduction of tariffs as a gesture to
other countries. By 488 votes to two
the Chamber on 31 July 1936 approved
a motion inviting Government to submit
without delay a Bill giving women the
right to vote.
The Blum Government has many other
projects in view, among them the crea­
tion of a national unemployment fund
and an insurance system against agri­
cultural catastrophes, the reorganization
of agricultural debts, and the creation
of a system of pensions **guaranteeing
the working-men of the towns and the
country against misery." " A Free,
Strong, and Happy France " la one of
the slogans of the present Government.
Other important changes within the
period 1932-36 have been :
Under the Laval Cabinet 1935, a
reduction of the legal rate of interest,
suppression of usury, a public works
plan for the relief of the unemployed
through the building of roads, level-
crossings and anti-flood defences, mea­
sures to help agriculture, etc. In 1933,
the largest dam in Europe was opened
at Rodez and Espalion ; a new maritime
station was inaugurated at Cherbourg
with deep water dock enabling the
largest liners to berth alongside the
quays.
A National Old Age Pension Fund,
has existed since 1850, and since 1910
an old age compulsory pension system
has given aid to the worker from his
60th year, increased for all who have
brought up three children to the age of
at least sixteen. Many public and
Ô9
1THE T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
private inducements towards large fami­
lies are provided, including industrial
allowances to the worker upon the birth
of a child, exemption and reductions in
taxation for families over two, and extra
taxation of the childless and unmarried.
Maternity help has been legally estab­
lished, and since 1923 an allowance is
given to a family of more than three
children under thirteen. The 1928 law
providing for compulsory social insur­
ance against the risks of illness, prema­
ture unfitness, old age and death, and an
extension of maternity and unemploy­
ment benefits came into force 1 July
1930. Public assistance is given the
poor through bureaux de bienfaisance.
Crime in the opinion of the Société de
Prophylaxie Criminelle is a disease ra­
ther than a mere violation of established
laws and the endeavour in France is
now to prevent rather than merely re­
press. In cases of jury disagreements
as to severity of punishments the most
severe iè eliminated, a revote being taken
on the next penalty.
The composite racial origins of France,
the assimilator—at the moment two
million exiles are living in France—and
its political pre-eminence for many
centuries are in a measure responsible
for the high level of intelligence, taste,
artistic and creative power which charac­
terize the population. In the economic
domain France is the world's principal
creator of fine quality and luxury articles
which attract the fastidious through
their taste, quality and finish. The
individuality and inventiveness of crafts­
men in many small industries have not
been overwhelmed by urbanization and
industrialization. Other qualities dis­
played by the nation as a whole are
adaptability, staying power, physical and
moral, a passion for hard work (which is
equally conspicuous in school, factory
and field), the thrift of the peasantry.
An exceptional economic role is played
by the French woman, who works with
head and hand in workshop, office, home
and kitchen, and also takes her full share
in the field. Rural electrification
modernizes farm homes. French agri­
culture has long been strongly supported
by the State and has made immense
progress in general and technical effici­
ency. Cd-operative marketing is Strong­
ly organized. *
Paris is in process of being rebuilt as a
silent smokeless city surrounded by many
garden cities. One of the worst slum
areas is to become the world's first *‘Inter­
national City of Art and Thought,"
where artists and craftsmen of all nations
will find studios, laboratories, theatre,
lecture halls, hospital and library. The
plan for Paris is a city without slums ;
every street wide, beautiful, and clean ;
a system of underground motor roads to
relieve traffic congestion ; every house
with central heating , acres of parkland
and garden—the wonder city of the
future.
Cultural Activities :
France has long had the power to
confer distinction merely by giving
membership prize, or degree in one
of her outstanding cultural institu­
tions, such as L ’Institut de France with
its famous Académies, the Université de
Paris à la Sorbonne, and many others.
Most recently elected to seats in the
Académie Française are M. Jacques
Bainville, historian (7 November 1935) ;
M. Louis Gillet, political journalist, and
M. Georges Duhamel, novelist (21
November 1935) ; Edmond Jaloux, cri­
tic, and Joseph de Pesquidoux, a writer
of simple novels about Gascony (2
July 1936).
M. Louis Barthou, the great unifier-
ambassador, left the Académie Fran­
çaise a legacy in 1935 for the founding
of three memorial literary prizes, to
himself, to his wife for a woman author,
and to his son for a poet not more than
thirty years of age.
The French Academy Tercentenary
was celebrated on 17 June 1935 and its
great founder, Cardinal Richelieu, was
remembered by a special mass. The
Lafayette Centenary 20 May 1934 was
another grand celebration.
A new tendency in realism was marked
about 1890 in French literature. While
preserving as a fundamental principle
the scientific method of observation,
realism took into account not merely the
physical, but also the stuff of feeling,
the impulses o f the soul, and spiritua

energy. As a result, thought became
reinvigorated and took on a neV lease of
life. Men working from very different
inspirations, Poincaré, Hamelin, Berg­
son, all contributed to this awakening.
Present-day literature seems to be moving
in the direction of a classic revival in
which certain other elements are mingled.
At few 'periods has there been so
much young genius in the field of creat­
ive art.
A Chair of Peape, forming part of the
Faculty of Law, has been established at
the University of Lyons, the first in
Europe. An emphasis is laid on Peace
in the educational field, and Lavisse télls
the youngest pupils ‘ *Vous ne voudrék
pas dominer ni humilier les autres
peuples.” (“ You would not wish to
dominate or humiliate other people” ).
On the other hand the necessity for secu­
rity is stressed, and a 1936 measure
introduced compulsory military training
graduated according to age up to 14, with
more intense training 14 to 18 and a
pre-military course between 18 and the
conscription age of 21. Government
has announced its intention to raise
the school age-leaving limit.
Church and State in France are separ­
ate and only lay teachers are permitted
in schools. Education begins in France
with 3,808 infant schools (Ecoles mater­
nelles), rises through 79,909 primary
and 421 secondary schools to seventeen
universities and many technical institu­
tions which complete the education of
this brilliant people. Children are to
be made “ air-minded ” : From 9 to 14
years they will receive preliminary in­
struction in aviation ; boys from 14 to
17 will be given “ gliding” lessons;
and youths between 18 to 21 will be
trained in aircaft engineering.
Theosophy in France :
General Secretary: Prof. J. Emile
Marcault, M.A., LL,B„ 1934-.
History : Theosophy came to France
/ in 1878 through the Duchesse de Pomar.
^ïn* T'879uhder the direction of M.
JLeymarie the first Lodge was char­
tered, The T. S. of the French
Spiritists. In 1882 La Société Théo-
mphique d'Orient et d'Occident, was
formed with the Duchesse de Pomar
(Countess of Caithness) as Honorary
President and M. Dramard as Executive
President ; and in the same year under
the leadership of M. le Docteur Fortin,
a group of learned men founded the
Société Scientifique des Occultistes de
France. A galaxy of famous men and
women received Mr. Sinnett in June
1881 ; among them were M. Bonne?
mère (historian), Baron du Potet,
M. Fremeschini (astronomer), M Sody
Effendi (son of the Chief of the
Maronites of Mount Lebanon), M. Levy-
Bing (philologist and archaeologist).
M. Camille Flammarion, the great
astronomer, was noted as being out of
the city. The visit of the Founders in
1884 was the realization of an invitation
given by the Duchesse de Pomar in
1879, and in her brilliant salon many
gathered to learn from the great occul­
tist Mme Blavatsky. A charter was
given by H.P.B. to M. Dramard for
Isis Lodge in 1887 ; this Lodge was
short-lived, and in 1888 Hermes Lodge,
in 1890 Lotus Lodge and Ananta Lodge
were formed by M. Arthur Arnould. In
1888 the Blech family joined The Society,
the brother and his two sisters throwing
their whole energy into the work. New
Lodges were formed and gained mem­
bers in spite of difficulties, until a
National Charter was issued, 2 August
1899, with Dr. Théophile Pascal as
General Secretary. The oldest living
Lodges in France are the Grenoble
Lodge (1896), Théophile Pascal Lodge
of Toulon (1896), Le Rayon Lodge of
Lyon (1899) and Lotus Lodge of
Paris (1899).
“ M. Charles Blech (General Sec­
retary from 1906 until his passing in
1934) and the famille Blech are house­
hold words, not only in France, but in
every country where Theosophy; is
known . . . Under the care of this
united trio The Society in France has
grown and flourished ” (Annie Besant).
Through their devotion and that of
Alfred Ostermann, working from 1912,
a fine Headquarters was built, which
was formally dedicated by Dr. Besant
at the First Theosophical World Con­
gress. In these Headquarters is a large
hall, a publishing department, with
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y EA R BOOK, 1937 91
basement book-bindery, bookshop, lend­
ing library and reading room, and many
smaller rooms, besides a large amphi­
theatre with accommodation for 650
and equipped with a kinematograph
plant.

'Propaganda : Most of the classics of
Theosophy have bfeen translated into
French, thus finding their way into the
hands of the French reading public the
world over. Some original literature
has been printed from time to time, Le
Marcault. After years of strenuous
work The Society has been largely
successful in placing before the public
the great facts of Reincarnation, Karma,
etc., now topics of common reference in
the press, current literature, the theatre,
as well as the conversation of the man
in the street.
The French Section mothered the first
Lodges in Rumania, Greece, and
Portugal before these became indepen­
dent Sections. Today, under France
are listed Lodges in Monaco, Lux­
emburg, and the French Colonies
and Protectorates: Algeria, Tunisia,
Morocco, Indo-China, Annam, Guade­
loupe—all nuclei of future Sections.

The Rise of the Nazi Party : The
National Socialist Party (Nazis) was
formed in 1919 with seven members,
among whom was Herr Hitler. None
of these men held a prominent position
in German political life. In 1920, the
Party had 64 members; 1921, 3,700;
1922, 7,000; 1923, 30,000. Under the
leadership of Herr Hitler, from 70,000
members the Party, after 1927, gained
phenomenally. In 1930, 6,500,000 elec­
tors voted for Hitler ; in the Presiden­
tial election of 1932, 13,417,460 votes
were cast for Hitler as against 19,539,642
for von Hindenburg. As in the Reich­
stag, the Nazi Party had 196 votes as
against Socialists 121 and Communist
100, Herr Hitler was offered the
Chancellorship, but refused as he and
the President had not at that time come
to an understanding as to the methods
to be pursued in bringing the German
nation out of its chaotic condition. The
report in December 1931 of the Inter­
national Committee investigating Ger*
many’s financial condition regarding
her power to pay Reparations, stated
that production compared with 1928 had
fallen to 66%, unemployment was
continually increasing, agriculture was
in a bad way, taxation was so high it
could not be higher, many banks were
in difficulties, the receipts of the Govern*
ment railways were steadily decreasing«
etc. Add to this impartial report the
fact that Germany was a suspect nation,
every minute change in her internal
affairs being watched with grave concern
$2 ^ P ^ p E O S O P H I C A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
by other nations (etten the organization
. of groups for sport by von Hindenburg
in 1932 being misconstrued as a war
threat), and one can readily understand
the flocking of the people of Germany
to a party which pledged itself to
Nationalism in its foreign and Socialism
in its internal policy, with the watch­
word "Germany, only Germany, no­
thing but Germany."
Practically all of the political parties
of Germany in 1932 had their private
armies, the Nazi44Storm Detachments ''
or 4
4brown shirts " being that of the Na­
tional Socialist Party. During the politi­
cal crisis of 1932, the Nazi Reichstag was
dissolved by the Chancellor during the
process of passing a 4*No-Confidence in
Government" vote (514 for, 32 votes
against). Outdoor meetings were for­
bidden, as well as the wearing of
distinctive uniforms. Nazi headquarters
were raided. Only a Supreme Court
decision prevented the Nazis from being
banned from Government employment.
Broadcasting was not permitted until
June, 1932. Hitler kept his men in
check, ordering them to follow the
44legal path to the conquest of political
power." Centralization of Government:
The deadlock was broken between
Germany's majority party and Govern­
ment 30 January 1933, when President
von Hindenburg appointed Herr Hitler
as Chancellor of the Reich, with un­
conditional freedom to carry out the
aims of the National Socialist Party.
The Enabling Act of 24 March 1933
(passed 441 to 94 votes) gave absolute
power to the Chancellor and his Cabinet
until 1 April 1937. Government became
eventually centralized, the States be­
coming administrative units. The
judicial system throughout the States
was likewise unified and placed under
the control of a central Government.
Greater power was vested in the judi­
ciary by the addition 8 July 1935 to the
penal code of a provision that 4
4if an
act is against healthy public opinion '’ a
Judge can sentence, even if the offence
is not found specifically in the code.
As the goal of the National Socialist
Party was the centralization of Govern­
ment and the unification of the German
people, private armies were forbidden,
and eventually all other parties were
either dissolved by Government or self-
dissolved, most of the members joining
the Government Party. Freemasonic
organizations were also dissolved as
being no longer necessary 44now that
the German nation had found unity."
Germany and Her Neighbours : Ger­
many stated that with the regaining of
the Saar Basin, she could make no
further territorial demands upon France.
A non-aggression pact was concluded
with Poland and offers were made to
conclude with all those Eastern States
which border on Germany similar non­
aggression pacts. In July 1936 a formal
pact of understanding was reached with
Austria. Herr Hitler repeatedly has
stated that Germany does not want war
and will welcome complete or partial
universal disarmament.
Party Purge : Inevitably in a one-
party Government attempts were made
to exploit the German people. In June,
1934, a purge was made of the Party
and upon its leaders the following in­
junctions, among others, were laid
by Herr Hitler : 4
4From S. A. leaders,
expecially. I want simplicity and no
ostentation. I do not wish them to give
or receive expensive entertainments.
Millions of our members still lack the
necessities of life. It is unworthy of the
National Socialists to increase still
further the chasm that divides those
who have been favoured by fortune and
those who have not." Leaders were
positively forbidden to exploit their
party membership to enhance their
social position. Purity was demanded.
441 would like every mother to feel
assured that her son, in joining the S.A.
or Hitler Youth, will not be morally
corrupted."
Four-Year Plan : Government im­
mediately launched a Four-Year Plan
to 4
4enable the German peasant to
maintain the food supply and to rescue
the German workman by a mighty and
comprehensive attack on unemploy­
ment." One of the methods used was
Labour conscription, not only to attack
the unemployment problem, but that
4
4W ork" might be made the 4
1true
T H E T H E O S O P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 m
standard of citizenship . . . in order to
provide that every German, whether
the son of a Prince or a scholar or a
workman, would learn to work with his
hands and respect the work of others.
The young men do fcix months of
valuable service such as drainage work
in flooded districts, road building iA the
mountains, etc., and the young women
(conscripted since 1935) work in new
settlements, helping the wives of new
settlers to overcome their initial diffi­
culties ; in agricultural districts helping
the farmers and their wives ; and in the
4
1distressed ’1 industrial areas, doing
housework and caring for the children
of working-class women. Before the
conscription, large voluntary labour
camps of young men showed the deter­
mination of Germany’s youth not to be
doomed to a life of lounging on street
corners in misery and idleness. So
important is this training to the National
(Socialist life that all official positions
Require background. As a result
¿f this levelling of class and caste a
t<^ne of easy familiarity and comradeship
between employer and employed is noted
m factories, etc. As for unemployment,
from over 6,000,000 unemployed early in
1932, by August 1933 there was a drop
of 2,500,000, and by September, 1934,
unemployment had been reduced by
4.500.000. From that time consistently
decreasing totals have brought the un­
employed in July, 1936, down to
1.170.000.
The problem of agriculture was attack­
ed in a unique manner. First a general
Moratorium for farmers February to
October, 1933. Then, among other
measures, there were created two classes
of land owners, the large-scale owners
and the peasantry ; the latter in October
1933 were made a privileged class. To
encourage the small holders of less than
310 acres who were capable farmers and
German citizens, their land was relieved
of liability to debt, mortgage, sale, or
division among heirs.
The returning confidence and pros­
perity of the people showed itself in
an increase of savings bank accounts
in 1934 of 45,000 and in 1935
of 70,000, the total increase in moneys
desposited in 1935 being 51,000,000
marks. *
Disputes between capital and labour
were settled through the dissolution of
the trade unions and their reintegration
into one homogeneous union of manual
and office workers as a common
“ Worker’s Front” of employer and
employed. All industrial associations
were incorporated 13 March 1935 into
one Chamber of twelve sections repre­
senting the following branches of indus­
try : (1) Mining, iron and metallurgy;
(2) Machine contruction, electricity,
optics, clocks and other mechanism ; (3)
Iron, tin plate and nickel goods; (4)
Minerals; (5) Chemistry, oils and paper;
(6) Leather, textiles and clothing ; (7)
Foodstuffs; (8) Handicraft; (9) Com­
merce ; (10) Banking and Credit; (11)
Insurance ; (12) Transport. An Indus­
trial / Leaders’ Council and Honour
Court co-operate in settling disputes and
general industrial problems.
The Four-Year Plan started in 1933
was completed one year before schedule,
and in September 1936, a new Four-
Year Plan was announced, the principal
objective being to produce by German
chemists, mines, and factories raw
materials that would make Germany
self-sufficient industrially and agricul­
turally. Already a superior grade of
rubber, fats, soap, etc., is being obtain­
ed chemically, and the soya bean is
extensively cultivated as a meat substi­
tute and for its by-products.
Scientific research is going on apace.
For example, television for the people
is an accomplished fact in Germany not
only through ultra-short wave transmit­
ters, but also through television tele­
phone between Berlin and Leipzig which
is soon to be extended in other centres.
Germany in 1933 ranked second highest
in Europe in number of cinemas—5,071.
Social insurance, though curtailed
during the nation’s crisis, had existed
in Germany since 1883. It comprises
compulsory insurance of workmen and
employees against sickness (including
maternity), accidents, unemployment,
old age, and infirmity. Germany's social
legislation has served as a model for all
others. Health: The health of the
94 T H E fT H E O S O P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
people has been for many years one of
the principal concerns of the National
Socialist Party and always the health
standard demanded for the Storm Troops
has been high.
The *‘ Kraft durch Freude ' ’ (Strength
through Joy) organizations, through
Government co-operation, make it pos­
sible forvthe masses at an unbelievably
low cost, to enjoy such pleasures as
attending the theatre, taking delightful
week-end or even long steamer journeys
during their legally-fixed and paid-for
vacations.
Some eugenic measures taken by the
Hitler Government are: Sterilization
and the prevention of marriage of thje
unfit, i.e., drunkards, sexual criminals,
lunatics, and those suffering from trans-
mittable incurable disease. Herr Hitler,
encourages humanitarian measures.
Cruelty to animals is heavily penal­
ized ; hunting is prohibited ; promis­
cuous vivisection is abolished, and
experiments permitted in authorized
scientific organizations are carefully re­
gulated. Cremation, encouraged legally
as hygienic, is becoming common prac­
tice. The declining birthrate is ap­
proaching normal through the stimula­
tion of dowries or marriage allowances ;
loans of 1,000 marks to aid those who
wish to marry, if the wife promises not
to re-seek employment while her hus­
band’s income remains above 105 marks ;
and grants to aid those of limited
incomes with five or more children.
Two tributes to Herr Hitler are
worthy of note : One left by von Hinden-
burg in his political testament of 15
August 1934 : “ My Chancellor, Adolf
Hitler, and his movement contributed
a decisive step of historic importance in
the great aim of leading the German
people together, above all differences of
caste and class, to inward unity.”
The other tribute was by Lloyd
George on the occasion of a visit in
September 1936 to Germany: “ In
Germany today, there is for the first
time since the war a general sense of
security. It is a happier Germany.
One man has accomplished this miracle.
He is a born leader of men. A magnetic,
dynamic personality with a single­
minded purpose, a resolute will, and a
dauntless heart. The old trust him ; the
young idolize him. I have heard speeches
of prominent Nazi orators freely con­
demned. But not a word of criticism
or disapproval have I heard of Hitler
. . . The nation has become unified.
Catholic and Protestant, Prussian and
Bavarian, employer and workman, rich
and poor, have been consolidated into
one people. There is a passion for unity
born of dire necessity. The clash of
rival passions is not only deprecated but
temporarily suppressed . . . Those who
imagine that Germany has swung back
to its old Imperialist temper cannot
have any understanding of the character
of the change. The idea of a Germany
intimidating Europe with a threat that
its irresistible army might march across
frontiers forms no part of the new
vision.”
Cultural Activities :
The present trends in German cultur­
al life reveal a closer •Association
between the academically educated and
the people as a whole ; a new emphasis
on the ideal of Woman as the Mother ;
a war through Chambers and Senates
of culture in the Reich on vulgarity ; a
practical renunciation, without the
coercion of prohibition, of the use of
alcohol in the last decade; in religion
a new worship of an archetypal Nation
which is dimly sensed as God in the
becoming, miscalled “ pagan ” because
it harks back to ancient Norse heroes and
celebrates the age-old Aryan Solstice
Festival. But the greatest miracle in
present Germany is its Youth—lad and
maiden. Trained for selflessness, help­
fulness, patriotism, devotion, sacrifice,
and true comradeship, in them, as Dr.
Besant saw, is “ a splendid set of young
people of whom any Nation might well
be proud ; no resentment and no anger,
eagerness to serve and help, readiness
to take up their part as they grow into
manhood and womanhood.” As am­
bassadors of New Germany, they have
established friendly relations with the
youth of other countries through ‘ ' the
wandering scholar,” student interchange
and correspondence, because, like youth
everywhere, they are determined to
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 95
maintain peace in Europe and through­
out the world. The ideal “ Beauty
through Work '’ has stimulated in them
creative activity to the highest degree,
and the principle in their youth organiza­
tions that MYouth must be led by
youth ’ ’ has developed in them leader­
ship. In choosing a leader for all the
many divisions of the Hitler Youth, the
first question asked is : ‘ 1What has he
done ? ’ ’ For the principle of Service is
dominant and through it are eliminated
the old-time distinctions of class and
position, profession and education, birth
and money. It is in the camps, schools,
and celebrations of youth that New
Germany is being constructed as a free
community on the basis of a thorough­
going equality in social comradeship.
It is a Germany inspired with the spirit
of creative youthfulness and at the same
time conscious of a mighty cultural and
historical inheritance. It is a Germany
determined to preserve and advance
everything that is essentially German
and in accord with the German spirit.
This it believes is the best service which
a nation can render to the common
interests of mankind. It was such a
youth that welcomed the world in 1936
to the Olympic Games and reverently
placed the torch lit from the sacred
flame on Mount Olympus and carried
by fast runners the 2,000 miles to the
Berlin Stadium, on the shrine of
Germany’s heart and hope. Such is
young Germany.
Theosophy in Germany:
Activities in the Section are at the
moment self-suspended.
History : The Germania T. S. was
formed in 1884"bv the President-Found-.
er with Dr. H ubDe-SHileiHei^ a^X ^ge
President—the ™
Tar-sighted statesman
who developed the German colonial
policy adopted by Prince Bismarck. The
Gebhards of Elberfeld, whose home
housed the first Lodge, could well be
called the founders of the Theosophical
Movement in Germany. In 1894 the
Berlin Lodge under Dr. Hugo Goring
was founded, also the MuutCtrLudge,
and the Leipzig Centre. In T902Tthe
German Section was chartered under,
the General Secretaryship of Dr. Rudolf
Steiner, who held;this office until 1910.
The movement spread far and wide
thoughout Germany. Because the neu­
trality of The Society was threatened,
the General Council in 1910 transferred
the ‘ charter of the Section to a group of
Lodges that stood for liberty of thought.
Dr. Hubbe-Schleiden was elected
General Secretary, followed by Mr.
Lauwericks. The Great War forbade
all communications. A few faithful
members held together, and Dr. Von
Kapff guided them for a few months.
Then followed a gap of over four years.
In 1919 an effort at reorganization was
made, but public life was so shattered
that little could be done. Herr Axel
von Fielitz-Coniar, Herr A. Schwarz,
and Fraulejn^M. Kamensky tried to
draw fire scattered remains of the old
organization together, but not until
Herr John Cordes, the Austrian Gene­
ral Secretary, assisted in 1921 was the
Section reorganized with Herr von
Fielitz-Coniar as General Secretary.
The Section grew through the twenties
until in 1932 it reached a peak of
forty Lodges and approximately 500
members. In 1935 the Section be­
came self-suspended, but Theosophists
throughout the world echo the hope
of our German brethren that soon
again the light of Theosophy will be
rekindled in the New Germany.
GREECE
King of the Hellenes: Georgeos
II, 27 September 1922— 18 December
1923 ; 3 November 1935-.
National Summary:
Keynote: Individualism, Brilliance,
Beauty.
A young King was exiled in Decem­
ber 1923 from a Throne he had held
insecurely for a year following the abdic­
ation of his father Constantine. A King,
a Man returned to that Throne on the
25th of November in 1935, called by the
96 ^ fH p T H E O S O P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
overwhelming majority of his people.
A King with the ideal that Ms ancestral
motto, ” My strength lies in the love of
die people,” should again live in Greece.
A man because for many years he had
lived as a man in contact with all sorts
and conditions of men, instead of being
confined within a narrow and subservi­
ent circle of courtiers. To the troubled
Throne of Greece His Majesty brought
the unalterable determination that he
would be ‘‘.King of all the Greeks ”
and not btftwp hitherto irreconcilable
factions, ignoring politicians, he ap­
pointed a non-political man, Demertzes,
as Prime Minister of a Service Cabinet
from which all political leaders were
excluded. He granted a general politic­
al amnesty, called a conference of all
Party leaders, and then granted daily
interviews to any and all political
visitors, particularly to those who were
anti-Royalists. His absolute impartial­
ity soon gained the support of the
Greek Republicans.
A plot against the State was dis­
covered, 5 August 1936 and martial
law proclaimed; parliament was dis­
solved, a new Cabinet formed, and
General Metaxas assumed command as
Prime Minister. The ideal of the pre­
sent Government is to operate on the
authoritarian State plan with one party,
though giving fullest scope to private
initiative. ” When healthy social and
economic conditions have been estab­
lished, the Government contemplate the
setting up of a representative system
under which the workers will be able to
collaborate in the national reconstruc­
tions.” (Metaxas).
Many of the King’s ideals for the
social betterment of his people are now
taking shape : The State is preparing to
monopolize the insurance business to
stop abuses and prepare the way for social
insurance; regulation of the working
day and fixing of minimum daily wage is
promised; a five-year plan has been
started for improving the public health
at a cost of about ¿4,000,000, of which
a quarter will be spent on public relief ;
the Budget has been fully balanced by
economies rather than increased taxa­
tion ; a certain amount of Press freedom
has been re-established ; all of which
has helped to consolidate the non-
Parliamentarian regime. Reconstruc­
tion of defence forces and a final settle­
ment with foreign debtors are the next
items on the agenda.
Unemployment in Athens is decreas­
ing, although the population, through the
absorption of a major portion of the
two million refugees from Asia Minor,
increased from 275,000 to over a million.
An achievement of the Republican
regime was the conclusion of an age-old
feud by the Turco-Greek Pact which
among other provisions permits Greece
to represent Turkey or Turkey Greece at
international conferences.
Cultural Activities :
The Greek Orthodox Church is the
State religion, but complete toleration
and liberty of worship are guaranteed to
all other sects. Mount Athos with its 20
monasteries, each a little republic in it­
self, is an autonomous Government.
There the monks of Greek, Russian,
Bulgarian, and Serbian monasteries and
hermitages till the fields, tend the vine­
yards, weave, and carry on ah secular as
well as sacred duties.
Education is compulsory for all child­
ren between seven and twelve. A com­
plete educational system, from kinder­
garten to the two universities in Athens
and one at Salonika, together with many
technical schools, provides excellent
cultural opportunities. A Chair in Far
Eastern Languages and Culture was
formed at the National University in
September 1935. The Ministry of Edu­
cation is also charged with the Service
of Antiquities, managed by an Archaeo­
logical Council responsible for the
conservation and reparation of ancient
monuments of all periods (Prehistoric,
Classical, Byzantine, and Mediaeval),
the upkeep of museums and the conduct
of excavations. French, American,
Italian, Austrian, German, and British
Schools of Archaeology delve into this
fertile field of discovery. Many have
been the excavations at Knossos, Crete,
Melos, Sparta, Thessaly, Mycenae, and
elsewhere.
Between 1910 and’ 1928 there was an
all but total conquest of the entire
T H E T H E O S O P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 m
literary field by the spoken language,
called the demotic or romaic, after a
century’s struggle with the scholastic or
“ pure” tongue. Two of the first
works of a new literature uniting the
eternal spirit of ancient Hellas, of
Byzantium, and of modern Greece were
The King's Flute and The Immutable
Life by Kostis Palamas in 1910. The
newer poets have ventured even farther
than Palamas into uncharted territory.
Among them are Angelos Sikelianos,
who rediscovered the secrets of the
ancient myths of sea and land and who
hymns the greatness of life. Modern
Greek literature is becoming more and
more touched with western inspiration
aoid form, and increasingly less By­
zantine.
An age-old culture has been that
of Greece, a culture from Minoan
and Mycenaean Ages (3,000 or 4,000
B c.), which even then indicated an
originality and freedom of expression
that comd only have emanated from a
still more ancient and advanced civili­
zation ; a culture which produced a
Parthenon, and statues of heroic beauty
forming a bridge of superhuman state­
liness between God and man ; a culture
which conquered its conquerors, and
thus was preserved as a heritage to the
western world.
T heosophy in Greece :
General Secretary : Cimon Prinaris.
1929-. Joint General Secretary, Paris
Hadji Petro, 1929-.
History : The Ionian T. S., the first
branch o f The Theosophical Society,
was organized by Signor PasqualeMene-
lao as President and Otho Alexander as
Secretary in 187?. This continued as
an actiVë cêïttfPof theosophy through­
out the 19th Century. In Athens, in
1914 the Hermes Lodge, and in 1915
the Apollon Lodge was formed. In
1923 in Athens was organized the Platon
Lodge (oldest now existing), under
Basile Krimpas, President, and Jean
Charitos, Secretary ; in 1924 Athena
Lodge under Mme Julie Diomede as
President and Mme E. Zarifi as Secre­
tary. With a small but determined group
of workers a few more Lodges were
organized, all under the aegis of the
French Section. Finally a Federation
became possible in 1927, and 21 May
1928 a Greek Section was chartered
with Basile Krimpas as General Secre­
tary and J. N. Charitos as Joint General
Secretary. The Society is greatly in­
debted to Mme Julie Diomede for her
generous aid during the whole of its
existence.
Propaganda : Since 1926 the Society
has had a small suite of rooms in the
centre of Athens in which classes are
held. A larger hall is procured for
public lectures.
The Theosophicon Deltion, a month­
ly journal, and occasional translations
of Theosophical works into Greek spread
the Ancient Wisdom.
HUNGARY
R egen t o f K in g d o m : Admiral Nicho­
las Horthy de NagyMnya, elected 1
March 1920.
N ational S u m m ary:
Keynote : " Freedom, Mysticism, Cul­
ture, Chivalry,” (G. S. A.) Motto:
” My trust is in the ancient virtues.”
The ideal of Kingship is dominant.
Though Hungary is kingless, a Regent
rules in the name of a future King
who will be chosen when the country’s
equilibrium has been restored. In
February 1935 the Regent was granted
all the powers of a King except
those of conferring gew titles of nobility
and ecclesiastical patronage. Because
of the Regent’s supreme control over
and the confidence given him by all
parties, Hungary has been able to work
tranquilly on its economic reconstruction
with no major political upheavals.
The Nation suffered the great loss, 7
October 1936, of the passing of General
Julius de Gombos, Prime Minister,
whose chief ambition was the realization
of a programme of land reform to bene­
fit the small farmers, and also the
introduction of measures of relief for
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
the masses of the people. One of the
measures taken by Government to insure
the freedom of democratic institutions
was the restoration, 2 April 1935, of the
secret ballot in order that class dictation
of landowning gentry over the peasantry
might be avoided. (The present Premier.
M. Daranyi, is emphasizing Democracy),
Gen. yGombos’s long tenure of office
was characterized by constant endeav­
ours to rebuild Hungary on firm eco­
nomic foundations and to restore her
equality of; itfttus in European affairs
lost through the Treaty of Trianon.
He was largely responsible for the
establishment and maintenance of* cor­
dial relations with Italy, Germany,
Austria, Poland and neighbouring
countries. A State with a “ keystone ”
position astride the middle Danube,
Hungary has an important part to play
in fostering the progress of Eastern
Europe and linking it more closely with
the West.
The National Social Insurance Institute
was called into existence by two funda­
mental laws passed in 1927 and 1928 to
regulate optional and obligatory social
insurance. The Institute affords its mem­
bers medical and hospital treatment
gratuitously and pays a subsidy during
illness, granting old age and disability
pensions. The insurance of farm-workers
under the Agricultural Workers’ Fund is
optional. Poor relief is left to communal
administration. Much assistance is
given the unemployed. The new Budget *
for 1936-7 is definite evidence of a slow
but continuous improvement in Hun­
garian economics, both industrial and
agricultural production showing an
increased valuation.
The Hungarian is heroic, proud,
deeply chivalrous, as is shown by the
unparalleled act of the Hungarian
nobility in 1843 in spontaneously giving
up every feudal privilege and setting
free their subjects. The Hungarian’s
word is his bond; this is illustrated
in Hungary’s joining the Central
European Powers in the War of 1914.
Hospitality and respect for foreigners
are innate. A certain national trend
which might be called, Ceremonial
Order and Beauty reaches its apotheo­
sis in one of Hungary’s great heroes,
the Adept-Prince RAkoczi.
Hungary’s present enforced incapac­
ity and spirit of reaction are not a true
expression of the Self of the Nation.
Her mission is to preserve and later give
to a world reborn the beauty of the
ancient virtues.
Cultural Activities :
Religion is a necessity to the Hun­
garian, and no cultural organization
is permitted to exist whose leader does
not belong to one of the many legally
recognized religions (Roman Catho­
lic, and Greek Catholic, Evangelical,
Unitarian, Jewish, Mohammedan, etc.).
Throughout the centuries Hungary has
been an heroic defender of Christendom,
and yet in Hungary for the first time in
Europe (1568) was freedom of faith
proclaimed.
Public education ranges from infant
and compulsory elementary to technical
and university training. An attempt is
being made to extend the very excellent
educational advantages of urban popula­
tion to the farthest reach of steppes
where schools of necessity are few and
the people are very poor. Free Univer­
sity lectures are popular ; many of the
people are linguists. Hungary’s econo­
mic difficulties have scattered talented
young artists and scientists abroad to
give Hungarian culture to the world.
Notable work done in the field of
Science by Hungarians is the Vitamin C
isolation and study of Dr. Szent Gyor­
gyi at Szeged, the discovery by Dr.
I. Weiss of methylene blue and sugar as
cure for illuminating gas poisoning;
the work on diabetic therapy by Dr.
Eugen Sagi.
Many world championships in sports
and games have been won by Hungar­
ians.
The countryside is beautiful with the
picturesque brightly coloured peasant
homes. Everything is decorated with
carving and paint from the simplest tools
to the house fronts. The household
linen and dresses are known the world
over for beautiful embroidery. The
development of a national painting and
sculpture has been slow, as the greatest
artists remained abroad. One of the
99
T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
first-rank portrait painters, Philip de
Laszlo, resides in England. Following
the Hungarian war of.Independence in
1848, an artistic renaissance expressed
itself in historical paintings. In spite of
the economic situation,1 the State, and
especially the city of Budapest, does
much to help artists by purchasing their
works. In Budapest there is a large
State Art School, and in the country
several colonies of artists. Many of
Hungary's artists have been members
of the T. S., among them Prof. Robert
Nidler, painter, and Bela de Takach,
painter and architect.
Hungarian music had a great revival
through the two well known composers,
Bela Bartók and Zoltán Kodaly, who,
travelling over the country, collected
folksongs, thus saving the hidden
treasures of Hungarian folklore from
oblivion. Through using the national
uniqueness, even as Liszt did in his
Hungarian Rhapsodies, they have built
up works of universal value and
greatness.
After the War, literature set itself to
the task of national regeneration. It
voiced the grief of the divided country
and its longing for the lost provinces.
Latterly the novel has held the centre
of attention, and lyric poets strive to
write great novels. Nowadays the ap­
pearance of an essay causes more stir
than did a poem before the War. The
younger generation is striving to break
down the ideology of the past and to
voice the aims of “ neo-nationalism."
There has been a similar renaissance
of philosophical thought. Historians of
the first rank are to be found in Hun­
gary. The Cultural Congress of the
Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian
peoples held at Budapest in 1928, the
cultural treaties in progress with Italy,
and made with Poland, whereby a
mutual exchange of professors and
students and literatures is to be made
for better cultural understanding, indi­
cate that Hungary will serve as a
melting pot for the cultures of many
racial types, the fusion of which
promises a new element of Beauty.
Theosophy in Hungary:
General *Secretary : Miss Flora Sele-
ver, 1932-.
History : Mr. Kiroly Zipernowsky, a
University Professor, travelling through
Vienna in the eighties noticed in a book*
shop win4pw Sinnett*s Esoteric
through the book, he changed his
itinerary and went directly to London
to join the English Section, as
the first Hungarian member. A little
later a German Theosophist, Ernst
Krause, gave a lecture in Budapest at
which many who afterwards became
prominent members were present. Mrs.
I. Cooper-Oakley visited Budapest first
in 1905, and those interested formed a
Hungarian Lodge attached to the Eng­
lish Section, holding weekly meetings
in the homes of Messrs. Agoston, Har-
sinyi and Zipernowsky. According to
the bylaws a Section was formed at the
Convention of 2 March 1906 under the
chairmanship of the High Court Judge,
Desider Szentmariay. The Adyar char­
ter was formally issued 16 November
1906 for seven Lodges dedicated to
Theosophy as expressed through art,
history, science and philosophy. (One
of these original Lodges " Blavat-
sky ’ ’ still is active). A great im­
petus at this time was given to the
young Section by Dr. Besant and
Dr. Steiner who lectured in Budapest.
Another stimulus came through the hold­
ing of the International Congress of the
European Federation in Budapest in
1909, with Dr. Besant in the chair. In­
ternal difficulties arose in the Sec­
tion and in 1910 Mrs. Cooper-Oakley
was sent by Dr. Besant to help
the Hungarian Section, and the rest
of her life was faithfully conse­
crated to that purpose. Professor
Robert Nidler, General Secretary, 1911-
lb, revived in 1921 the war-torn Section.
Under the leadership of Mrs. de Rithr
onyi, General Secretary (1927-32), the
Section realized its *‘ golden age. ’’ All
the great leaders lecturing in Hungary
linked the Section to the world ; public
activities were multifarious ; the Federa­
tion Congress met in Budapest in May
1929, Dr. Besant was given an audience

K in g o f Sovereign State : King
Christian X of Denmark. Iceland since
1381 under the rule of Denmark, from
1 December 1918 has been united only
through the identity of the Sovereign,
and through an Act of Union (1918-40)
which places foreign affairs under
Danish control.
N ational S u m m ary:
Keynote : The indomitable spirit of the
Viking touched with the flame of Celtic
beauty.
Most of the original colonists who
founded the Icelandic Republic in 930
A.D. were Norwegians ; a few came from
Ireland and the Hebrides. Though one
of the latest countries to be colonized, it
claims a Parliament and code of laws
dating from the 10th century. Treaties
of Union were made in 1262 with
Norway. In 1381 Iceland swore alle­
giance to the Danish Kings, but always
demanded a status as an individual and
Sovereign State, which was definitely
recognized to the satisfaction of both
States in 1918. Under the Constitution
of 1920 (amended 1934) the executive
power is exercised by a Ministry of three
departments : Justice and Agriculture ;
Trade and Education ; Finance.
Within the last sixty years roads have
been made, bridges built over wild
rivers, a net of telephones laid over the
country, lighthouses placed along the
coasts, the country has been electrified,
a radio station installed, a complete edu­
cational system established headed by a
fix^e University, and a Capital City,
Reykjavik, built.
quarters for the Theosophical work.
They are dauntless in determination
to make Theosophy available in the
Hungarian language. When funds for
publication fail, they typewrite recent
books for their excellent circulating
library of 4,000 volumes. Weekly public
lectures attract good audiences and co­
operation of the Press is secured. Such
courage is bound to succeed, and already
a marked upward trend is noted in book
sales and public interest.
AND
Though Iceland lies half within the
Arctic Circle, no fewer than 109 farms
have successfully grown corn with
specially acclimatized seed, and now
even wheat crops are to be attempted in
the southern districts. H6at from the
abundant springs also permits the cul­
tivation of all vegetables and pven
tropical fruits in glass houses.
By the law of December, 1935, every
needy person is entitled to relief from
his community: since 1 February 1936,
four branches of social insurance.
Accident, Sickness, Invalidity and Old
Age, and Unemployment have been in
effect. Sanitation, stressed since the war,
has made a marked improvement of
the people's health.
The permanent neutrality of Iceland
is established and the Nation possesses
neither army, navy, nor fortifications.
Cultural A ctivities :
The Icelandic, mother of Scandinavian
tongues, is one of the mildest and
richest of all languages, abounding
in precise and compact roots, which
are enriched to express the most
delicate and intuitive shades of mean­
ing. The literature dates from the
12th century. Poetry is the art of arts
in Iceland. Old Icelandic poetry falls
under two heads—the Eddie lays and
Court poetry, and dates from the ninth
century. Outstanding among the many
modern Icelandic poets is the name of
Rev. Matthias Jochumsson (1835-1920)
author of the national hymn, whose
works are aflame with the life of the
spirit.
T H E T H E O S O P H IC A L Y E A R BO O R, 1937 101
The younger generation shows decided
tendencies toward creative originality in
art, music, drama and poetry. An
outstanding sculptor is Einar Jonsson,
the 4
' poet in stone. ’ ’ Jn his early years
he became acquainted with Theosophy,
and Theosophical ideas and ideals are
everywhere visible in his works, as in
Evolution, Karma, The King of Atlan­
tis, The Birth of Psyche, Bound by
the Letter, and the fine relief bust of
Dr. Annie Besant as a young woman in
which he expresses his ideal of her as
standing free, strong, true, fine, and
graceful. The State of Iceland has
built a Museum for his works, where he
also has his workshop and home. Paint­
ers are many. The most original
is Johannes Kjarval, delicate in his
treatment of colour and daring in style.
Asgrimur Johnsson is a noteworthy
painter of Iceland’s majestic hills and
mighty rivers.
A College for Music has been estab­
lished in Reykjavik and its symphony
orchestra gives five public concerts every
winter. Choir singing is practised in
all the larger towns. Among young
composers John Leifs is perhaps best
known outside the country. His orches­
tral arrangement of old Icelandic folk­
songs is striking and modernistic.
Sveinbjorn Sveinbjornsson, composer
of the National Anthem, is a note­
worthy representative of an older
school.
Candidates for the priesthood in the
national and only endowed Church
must have taken a theological degree at
the University of Iceland, have a
blameless reputation, and be chosen by
secret vote of parishoners over 21 years.
The Church is most liberal, and many
adherents to the new theology and
spiritualism are found among the
younger dlergy.
Theosophy in Iceland : '
General Secretary, Gretar Fells,.
1935-.
History : The first Lodge in Iceland
was Reykjavik, chartered in 1912 under
the Danish Section, Jon Jbffftsson,
President; Jakob Kristinsson, Secretary ;
the second Lodge was Akureyi, Syst-»
kinabandid, 1913, Jonasson, President;
Miss. A Sigurdaidottir, Secretary. Both
of these Lodges are active. The Section,
was chartered 5 January 1921 under
Jakob Kristinnsson, first General Secre-
tafy. At present the Section has only
six Lodges. From the seventh, the
Laugarnes Lodge at the Leper Hospital,
‘ ‘ one by one the members threw on
their miserable garment of flesh and
went to the Lodge above.” Mr. Jina-
rajadasa after a three weeks’ visit in
1927 brought back glowing reports of
a ” remarkably fine National Society.”
Mr. Bolt has greatly assisted the Section
since 1928, and organized their most
successful Summer Schools in 1933.
Propaganda : Novel methods are used
to reach the public—music recitals, com­
munity singing, lantern slides, social
gatherings, and the public meetings
are always crowded. The radio carries
Theosophy far and wide. The attrac­
tive journal Gangleri has a popular
appeal. The Order of Service is active.
Libraries with books well bound by the
members attract the reading public.
When financial difficulties assail the
work, the spirit of Iceland is expressed
by the General Secretary : ” The spirit
of the age seems to be against us, but
we are going on with our work and I
hope we will be successful in changing
the spirit of the age.”

National Summary:
Keynote : **The Spirit of Aryan
civilization and culture—Dharma—
latent in India as she is today, but
moving towards renaissance. India is
the heart of the Aryan wprld.” (G.S.A .)
India 'is on the eve of a form of
Government which will give her a
considerable amount of autonomy in the
various provinces and a certain amount
of influence at the Centre (Delhi). This
Constitution provides for Federations
which will for the first time unite into
one political whole British India and
the 600 or more Indian States. But the
Constitution is hedged about with safe­
guards and reservations (financial,
economic, and military) which have
made it unacceptable to many thinking
Indians. There can be no doubt what­
ever that the urge for complete self-
government is growing stronger day by
•day. The Congress party, which is
composed of the most dynamic elements
amongst the Indian people, has found
by experiment that its methods of non-
co-operation with Government and its
boycott of the Legislature are not
practicable under the present circum­
stances. Members of the Congress
intend now to take an active part in
the constitutional politics of the country
.and are bound to sway the Legislatures
in all Provinces.
The preamble to the Government of
India Act of 1919 stated : “ It is the
declared policy of Parliament to provide
for the increasing association of Indians
in every branch of Indian administration,
and for the gradual development of
self-governing institutions, with a view
to the progressive realization of respon­
sible government in British India as an
integral part of the Empire.” Only
when such a ‘*responsible government. ’ ’
of India by Indians has been established
can India fulfil her true destiny. Though
the new Viceroy under the 1936 Con­
stitution has many plenipotentiary
powers, he has made an appeal for
mutual trust and co-operation: “ I
shall never doubt your sincerity or the
integrity of your mind. I ask no more
than that you favour me with the same
whole-hearted trust . . . Let us
move boldly forward with faith and
courage, you and I, and with all our
strength, striving to better the lot of our
people, wherever they may be, and
sustain the fame and glory of the great
name of India over all the world.'
One difficult problem India has to
face is the widespread unemployment
both amongst the educated people and
the masses. Though forty.million are
listed as unemployed, in reality only
15,400,000 people are at work, each
providing for an unemployed family.
Women workers receive 4d. to 8d. a
day ; male unskilled labour a weekly
wage of five shillings, with a working
day of ten to eleven hours; textile
workers, the best paid, receive £ 3 to
£ 5 monthly. There are thousands of
homeless people in Bombay, only 4%
of the city’s entire population knowing
the joy of having a place to live in. Yet
many of the necessities of life, milk, for
example, cost as much as in other coun­
tries. This has favoured the growth of
the socialistic movement of which the
chief protagonist is the president of the
Congress, Pundit Jawaharlal Nehru.
This movement is still in its infancy, but
it is likely to grow more powerful as
time goes on. It is aimed at demolishing
vested economic interests, particularly
the Zamindari system (landlord-tenant
farms). Before foreign occupation, land
in India belonged to the King and State
in theory, but in practice it was used
by the villagers in common, each village
developing and profiting by the land
which was situated round about it.
Another very striking movement of
modern times is aimed at the uplifting
of the submerged classes. Mr. Gandhi,
the unquestioned leader of the Congress
during recent years, has identified him­
self completely with the objects of this
movement, even to the extent of suc­
ceeding in having thrown open to every­
one without distinction many temples
hitherto reserved for the use of the
higher castes. The recognition by the
great Law-Giver Manu of human society
as composed of four distinct divisions of
function—Priest, Warrior, Merchant or
T H E T H E O S O P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 103
Provider, and Server—with a code of
laws and caste-rules for each, has in
modern times become crystallized into
castes within castes, even the so-called
outcastes having innumerable divisions
making barriers between those with a
common cause. The President-Founder
early saw the need for assisting these
Panchamas (fifth-caste), and his schools
for outcastes, particularly the Olcott
Harijan School at Adyar, have served
as models in India.
To appreciate fully the part The
Theosophical Society has played in the
renaissance of India, one has only to
study the history of The Society and the
biographies of its leaders and workers.
Even be ore the Founders landed in
Bombay in 1879, Isis Unveiled, written
by Mme Blavatsky, had revealed
to a startled western world the wealth
of hidden treasure lying concealed
in the Oriental and particularly the
Indian civilization. The first lecture
delivered by the President-Founder* ap­
pealed to India to recognize her own
magnificent culture, her own spiritual
greatness, and not to overlay it with a
coating of western veneer. The first
westerner to be elected a Pundit in the
exclusive Pundits’ Association of Bena­
res, in that same year he entreated
Indians to make a determined effort to
revive the use of Sanskrit, not only in
translations of the ancient scriptures but
in the use of its rich terminology for
modern scientific lore. He instituted
the first '' Swadeshi ’ ’ Exhibition of
Indian craftsmanship under western
auspices. He toured the land, organi­
zing schools and associations of Hindu
religious thought wherein young princes
and high born youth'could be trained as
Indians rather than imitation westerners.
No less did The Society support the
other faiths of India: Islam, Bud­
dhism, Zoroastrianism, Jainism, etc.
The Adyar Library, known the world
over for its rich treasure of Oriental
MSS., remains one of the President-
Founder’s greatest contributions to
Indian culture.
The magnificent work of the second
President, Dr. Besant,* for India’s re-

generation falls into a natural sequence:
First thft vivification of Hinduism, the ,
religion of the greater portion M India’s
peoples, and the rousing of the national­
istic spirit amongst Indians, based on
an appreciation of her past and the
spiritual ideals underlying her culture
and civilization. Then she established
the Central Hindu College at Benares in
1898 (now the Benares Hindu Univer­
sity) and from far and wide came Indians
to the first school of higher education
where they could drink of the fount of
wisdom without a distinction of '' West ’ ’
or “ East.” Here was a school which
taught them of their country’s greatness,
which integrated them as Indians. Dr.
Besant later fostered a wider national
education movement; also an Indian
Scout Movement, which was later affili­
ated with the International Movement;
Lord Baden-Powell appointing her Com­
missioner for India and rewarding her
shortly before her death with the Order
of the Silver Wolf. Shortly before the
European War, Dr. Besant turned her
attention to Indian politics and launched
the Home Rule Movement. Synthesiz­
ing the aspirations of Indian patriots, it
gained instant popularity. While she
held uncompromisingly to the ideal of
full political freedom for India and equal
partnership with other dominions in the
British Commonwealth of Nations, she
held no less uncompromisingly to the
fact that India and Britain needed each
other, for only in the union of these two
great peoples in mutual and free co­
operation could the great Plan be ful­
filled of a union of East and West in a
Commonwealth of Peace and Comrade­
ship.
In close association with this great
woman who worked from so many
angles for the fulfilment of a people,
both in the educational field since 1903,
and in every movement she thereafter
instituted, was the present President,
Dr. George Sydney Arundale. In the
Central Hindu College, its Principal
during its formative years, Minister of
Education at the court of the Maharajah
of Indore, collaborator with Dr. Besant
in the Home Rule League, throughout
India he is esteemed for his more than

also in temples; Mohammedans have
congregational prayers in their mosques ;
a Jain must visit his temple daily. But
whether Hindu, Mohammedan, Bud­

Outstanding scientific work is being
done in India’s research laboratories

work of Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose,
who, through his delicate and precise
measurements of the reactions of plant
and mineral, proved conclusively the
identity of life in all kingdoms.

You find in the Hindu religion that the
Lord of the Dance has His manifesta­
tion as a Divine Dancer ,
‘ ‘ We are told that the Lord of the
Dance was asked by a very great man to
explain to him something of the philos­
ophy of the four Vedas, the great scrip­
tures of the Hindus. The Lord tried to
explain the philosophy to him, but the
man said : ‘ I cannot understand it in
those forms. They are too difficult.
Can you not show them to me in some
simpler form, so that I can appreciate
them ?, Then the Lord created the fifth
J£gda.i the Veda of the Dance, and He
showed that SII “
thè philosophy of life,
all the science of life, can be expressed
through the moving form and music.
So He danced His Divine Dance, and
as He danced the whole Universe dan­
ced with Him . . .”
The same is true of the exquisite and
penetrating sweetness of Hindu music,
the most highly and scientifically devel­
oped melodic structures known to art:
‘ ' Hinduism will tell you what its mean­
ing is, what its spiritual significance is,
and what the exact effect is upon
humanity . , . Music is as much an
offering to the Highest as flowers or
incense.
“ When India realizes her own message
that beauty is sacred, that beauty brings
happiness into the world, when the great
arts that exist in India today which are
unconscious and simple shall become
conscious . . . then India will make a
distinct contribution to their civiliza­
tions . . .
" Ugliness and vulgarity can have no
place in art . . . Through art will
come into the world real culture and
true refinement. Art is the equivalent
for humanity of the flower and the jewel.
We must in our humanity become the
flower, the jewel, and express this great­
ness in terms of understanding, in terms
of kindness, in terms of beauty in
everyday living. Remember that every
single individual is an artist. There is
no barrier in art. Let us bring the
materialistic happiness and the contribu­
tion of technique of the West to the
spiritual ideas and philosophy of the
East . . . Then only shall we have
true art, true civilization, and the fulfil­
ment of the Message of Beauty.”
The ideal of Indian womanhood is ex­
pressed in its purity by Shrimati Ruk-
mini Devi, its apotheosis : “ It is to be
herself more than anything else, to be
divine in her own being, to be a piece of
art, not only an artist . . . I do not care
what work a woman does, but I do care
what life she expresses. She must ex­
press the true life of the Divine
Woman . . . She can paint, make
statues, speak in public, do anything she
likes, but unless she lives the life of
a true woman and a true artist . . .
she cannot contribute to the happiness
of mankind. Woman is the npother of
the whole world . . . To give to the
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 107
world the spirit of motherhood is the
highest and greatest contribution of
woman."
Theosophy in India:
General Secretary : G. N. Gokhale.
The Section works through eleven
Autonomous Federations, and five direct­
ly attached, including a Youth Federa­
tion. The Headquarters of the Indian
Section at „genares, together with most
of TEe buildings7~\vere a gift of Dr.
Besant and her friends to the Section in
'Getobe^-1907. She further donated
her residence, Shantikunja, and Gyan-
geha, the total area comprising about
fifteen acres, with a valuation of
Rs. 1,35,000.
History : The very first Fellow of
The Theosophical Society in India was
Mooljee Thackersey who joined in 1877
after correspondence with the Presi­
dent-Founder. Several of his friends
also joined, including Kavasjee Mer-
vanjee Shroff, the first Parsi member.
Through this group the Founders were
put in touch with the Arya Samaj, and
for a time were closely affiliated with
this organization striving for the revival
of Hindu culture. The first Lodge was
The Bombay Theosophical Society in
Mayj.880^ The early history of Theos-
'frpffy^Tn India was the story of The
Theosophical Society itself which is to
be found in detail in the " Chronicle
of Events ” and the History of The
Society (p. 63). In those first years Theos­
ophy was active only in the immediate
environment of the Founders; even
in later years too great an emphasis
cannot be placed on the presence
of The Society’s headquarters as a
factor in the life and growth of the
Section.
But soon arrived those pioneer workers
who were to build up The Society in
India, from the handful of members
who greeted the Founders on arrival and
the one Lodge formed a year after, to
the 256 existing Lodges, and 21 Centres,
comprising 3,995 active members, not in­
cluding the 25 Youth Lodges with their
353 Youth Members. Great names
among the thousands of faithful workers
for Theosophy in India besides those
General Secretaries mentioned in the
W ho’s Who Section, include: Mr.
Hirendra *Nath Datta (Vice-President),
RnsTTOOrasea Arundale, J. R. Aria,
N. Sfi RamTTinafr^dger, C. Jinaraja-
dasa, Damodar K. Mavlankar, K.
Narayanaswami Aiyer, F. G. Pearce,
Dewan Bahadur R. Ranghunatha Rao,

das Dwarkadas, Mr. Kanji Dwarkadas,
Seth Ratansi Morarji, Upendranath
Basu, P. K. Telang, D. K. Telang,
Dr. Trilokekar. *
The Section was chartered in 1890,
Bertram Keightley having come from
England at the request of H . P. B. to be
its first General Secretary^ Some of the
principal events connected with the
Theosophical leaders in India, were: ;
The establishment of the Centrai-Hiadu.
College at Benares^ 1 July 1898 ; the
foundation “of fKe Benares*ffi^tl'(|ilar‘tersr
October 1907; New India founded
1914 ; Madanapalle College opened 19
July 1915 ; Women's College in Benares
founded 1916; Women’s Indian As­
sociation founded 8 May 1917 ; Young
Theosophist Movement started August
1923 ; 21 December 1925 consecration of
Bharata Samja Temple at Adyar. The
event of 1936 was the holding of
the International Convention at Benares.
Propaganda : As the various Federa­
tions are autonomous, methods of pro-
paganda vary greatly with the different
Sections. Out of the Rs. 4 annual dues,
the Sections retain Rs. 2, and with this
generally employ a paid Lodge Organi­
zer or pay the travelling expenses of an
honorary worker. Western and other
non-Indian visitors also greatly assist
the Section. The General Secretary,
Joint General Secretaries, and Federa­
tion Secretaries also cover as much of
the field as is possible. The Section
Journal, The Indian Theosophist,serves,
more as *a linOietween members than as
a means of propaganda. Many leaflets,
are distributed; and the Federations
are doing the much needed work of
publishing Theosophical works in the
various languages of India.

To the Indian Section is given
the grave responsibility and glorious
privilege of giving Theosophy to an
India in the throes of a great recon­
struction, an India wherein conflict­
ing forces are battling for supremacy.
And yet emerging fr6m the struggle
there is arising a new India, an
India with all the glories of her
ancient heritage, an India throbbing
with the vibrant hope of a future
fulfilment.

Keynote : ‘‘ The Spirit of Culture
and of closeness to Nature. Perhaps
a beautiful bridge between the
human and the angelic kingdoms
i G. S. A.). The Irish Free State
'(Saorstat Eireann), embracing all of
Ireland but the northern six counties,
having proclaimed itself a Republic in
January 1919, on 6 December 1921
signed a Treaty with Great Britain,
providing that it should have the same
relation to the Imperial Parliament and
Government as the Dominion of Canada,
.and that until the Irish Free State
could undertake its own coastal defence,
the defence by sea of Ireland would be
undertaken by the Imperial forces. By
the Treaty “ Northern Ireland” was
.given the option of continuing its
•existence as a more integrally linked
part of the United Kingdom, continuing
to return 13 members to the Imperial
House of Commons, though enjoying a
separate Parliament and Supreme Court.
The urge of the Free State for a
•complete individuality of expression as
a Sovereign Nation has led its Ddil or
sole Legislative body (the Senate having
been abolished 28 May 1936) to remove
the Oath of Allegiance, 9 May 1933,
and to pass a Citizenship Bill which
•changes the status of its citizens from
“ British subjects ” to “ citizens of the
Irish State,” making, however, an ex­
emption from its definition of ‘ ‘ alien ’ ’
citizens, subjects, or nationals of the
countries of the British Commonwealth
of Nations, the present Government also
affirming its will not to permit Ireland
to be used as a base for an enemy attack
against Britain. These measures so com­
pletely change the status of the nation
that a new Constitution is now in process
of formation. The Government declares
that the Irish Free State will not be
formally proclaimed a Republic without
a plebiscite to ascertain the people’s
definite wish. While the feeling against
partition of Ireland into Northern and
Free State is very strong in the South,
the North still affirms its allegiance to
the Crown.
Cultural Activities:
Greater even than the urge for
independence is the desire in Ireland
to preserve the Celtic cultural tradi­
tions. Since the establishment of
the SaorstAt the Irish language is
included as an essential part of the
curriculum for all National Schools
and the Gaelic script is used for official
documents. Elementary education fi
free and is given in National School«;
secondary or intermediate schools are
under private control and are conducted
in many cases by Religious Orders,
though receiving State grants. Techni­
cal and agricultural education is readily
available, and particular stress is laid
on co-operative organizations. Univer­
sity education is given at the University
of Dublin (Trinity College) founded
1591 and at the National University of
Ireland, founded in Dublin 1901 with
colleges in Dublin, Cork, Galway,
While the Roman Catholic Church
leads in both Northern and Southern Ire­
land in number of adherents, in Northern
Ireland Roman Catholics comprise
about 30% of the religious population
and in Southern Ireland 93%*

As a result of the “ Judge split “ in
1895, the members of the Dublin Lodge,
left with Judge, their fellow-countryman.
Another Dublin Lodge was formed in
1904, but ceased to function after
Colonel Olcott’s death.
Dr. Annie Besant revisited Ireland
in 1903 and stimulated the formation of
another Dublin Lodge. Dr. James H.
Cousins became its^Secretary and the
'members—were mainTy^y^hg^ people,
some of them undergraduates of Trinity
College. Lodges were formed in other
cities, but the departure of Dr. and Mrs.
Cousins for England and Adyar and the
outbreak of the War in 1914 postponed
the formation of a National Section until

and has become a treasure-hunt for
collectors. The present Section journal
is Theosophy in Ireland. There ha«
been a reawakening of enthusiasm, due
not only to the stimulus of the new ad­
ministration programme but also to the
inauguration of Summer Schools which

The March on Rome. To combat
the spread of Communism in Italy, the
Fascist Party, created and led by Benito
Mussolini, after three years of unofficial
conflict, called on Government to restore
order within forty-eight hours or ?*on
the expiry of this delay, Fascism will
assume full freedom to supplant the
State. ** A march was started on Rome,
the King sent for Mussolini, and to his
T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L Y EA R BOOK, 1937
i i o >
firm hand entrusted the destinies of
Italy. Order was restored, Corruption
uprooted, abuses were eliminated, and
deficits in public utilities converted into
surpluses. Great public works have
been achieved, including the reclama­
tion of a whole Province (Littorio) from
the swamps and marshes, construction
of gigantic aqueducts, electrification of
railways, the building of the magnificent
Forum Mussolini covering 328 square
miles. Compulsory insurance has been
inaugurated (for those with limited in­
come) against disablement and old age,
involuntary unemployment, tuberculosis
(with the aim of extension later to*all
diseases) ; mother and child are especi­
ally protected and cared for; ex­
prisoners are rehabilitated ; the Opera
Nazionale Dopolavora insures healthy
and profitable occupation of the workers’
leisure hours in the development of
physical, intellectual and moral capac­
ity. The Balilla and Avanguardisti
inculcate in youth the Fascist ideal.
But the unique development of the Fas­
cist era in Italy is the Corporative or
Guild State :
Every producer in Italy, capitalist or
labourer, employer or employee, profes­
sional man or intellectual worker, has
equal rights in State-recognized regional
Trade Union Syndicates, those of the
employees being based on the Fascist
Labour Charter. From the foundation
of this nation-wide mass of syndicates
arise federations and confederations and
twenty-two Corporations, all of which
protect the common interests of em­
ployers and employees from regional to
provincial levels ending, like pyramids,
in peaks (Sections of the Council) which
protect the common interest of employers
and employees on a national level.
These summits represent industry,
agriculture, banking, the arts, etc.
Builded upon the broad foundation
of the people as producing factors,
these Corporations are linked to the
Fascist State through Sections of the
Council of Corporations, the nerve-
centre and point of collaborative contact
between the State and the Corporations,
and reporting through a Minister of
Corporations responsible to the Prime
Minister himself. Thus, while the
Corporative State recognizes the rights
of private enterprise to produce, it so
regulates that production that all diver­
gent elements co-operate for the good of
the State. As Italy is a country of
small and medium-sized industries with
a strong agriculture, the Guild System'
is peculiarly adaptable to its needs.
However, 4
4 If the guild system is to be
carried out fully, completely, integrally,
revolutionarily,” Signor Mussolini holds,
4
4 three conditions are required : A
single party so that economic discipline
may be accompanied by political discip­
line, and so that rising above contrasting
interests all may be bound together by a
common faith . . After the single
party there must be the totalitarian
State . . . which absorbs all the ener­
gies, all the interests, all the hopes of a
people in order to transform and poten­
tiate them . . . The third and last
and most important condition is to live
in a period of high ideal tension. . . .”
Fascist Idealism : The following
quotations, all taken from Mussolini,
Fascism, Doctrine and Institutions,
indicate the Fascist idealism, as inter­
preted by Signor Mussolini :
Fascism on discipline, struggle,
peace: The very name 4
4Fasci Italini
di Combattimento ’ ’ embodies the idea
that ‘ ‘ Life for the Fascist is a continu­
ous ceaseless fight, which we accept
with ease, with great courage, with the
necessary intrepidity.” Asked to ex­
pound the significance of Fascism in one
sentence, Mussolini wrote, 4
4We are
against the 4easy ’ life.” 4
4Life, as
conceived of by the Fascist, is serious,
austere, religious.”
1
4 Struggle is the origin of all things.
. . . If a day came to pass when strug­
gle ceased to exist, that day would be
tinged with melancholy; it would be
a day of ruin, the day of ending. But
that day will not come, because history
ever discloses new horizons. By attempt­
ing to restore calm, peace, tranquillity,,
one would be fighting the tendencies of
the present period of dynamism.” (Com­
pare with Dr. Besant’s answer to
the question, 4
4What is the end of
the evolutionary struggle ?’ ’ namely that
T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1957 111
to vision an end would be stagnation and
unthinkable.)
“ The Fascist State expresses the will
to exercise power and to command. Here
the Roman tradition is embodied in a
conception of strength . . . The Fascist
doctrine is that best suited to the tenden­
cies and feelings of a people which, like
the Italian, after lying fallow during
centuries of foreign servitude, is now
reasserting itself in the world. But
imperialism implies discipline, the co­
ordination of efforts, a deep sense of
duty, and a spirit of self-sacrifice.”
" The individual by self-sacrifice, the
renunciation of self-interest, by death
itself, can achieve that purely spiritual
existence in which his value as man con­
sists . . . Not a supinely optimistic
doctrine which places the centre of life
outside man ; whereas, by the exercise
of his free will man can and must create
his own world.’ ’
'' A nation exists inasmuch as it is a
people. * A people rise inasmuch as they
are numerous, hard-working and well-
regulated. Power is the outcome of
this threefold principle.”
Fascism on Democracy : “ Fascism
denies . . . the right of numbers to
govern by means of periodical consulta­
tions ; it asserts the irremediable and
fertile and beneficent inequality of men
who cannot be levelled by any such
mechanical and extrinsic device as uni­
versal suffrage.”
Fascism on the State : “ The key­
stone of the Fascist doctrine is its con­
ception of the State, of its essence, its
functions, and its aims. For Fascism
the State is absolute, individuals and
groups relative. Individuals and groups
are admissible in so' far as they come
within the State . . .
" The State, as conceived and realized
by Fascism, is a spiritual and ethical
entity for securing the political, juridical
and economic organization of the
nation, an organization which in its
orgin and growth is a manifestation of
the spirit. The State guarantees the
internal and external safety of the
country, but it also safeguards and
transmits the spirit of the people elabora­
ted down the ages in its language, its
customs, its faith. The State is not only
the present, it is also the past and
above all the future. Transcending
the individual’s brief spell of life,
the State stands for the immanent
conscience of the nation. The forms
in which it finds expression change,
but the need for it remains. The
State educates the citizens to civism,
makes them aware of their mission,
urges them to unity ; its justice har­
monizes their divergent interests; it
transmits to future generations the
conquests of the mind in the fields of
science, art, law, human solidarity; it
leads men up from primitive tribal life
to that highest manifestation of human
power, imperial rule. The State hands
down to future generations the memory
of those who laid down their lives
to ensure its safety or to obey its law i
it sets up as examples and records for
future ages the names of the captains
who enlarged its territory and of the
men of genius who have made it famous.
Whenever respect for the State declines
and the disintegrating and centrifugal
tendencies of individuals and groups
prevail, nations are headed for decay.”
“ Without the State there is no nation.
There are merely human aggregations,
subject to all the disintegrations which
history may inflict upon them . . . ”
” For us the Nation is mainly spirit and
not only territory . . . a nation is great
when the power of the spirit is translated
into reality.”
" The Fascist State, as a higher and
more powerful expression of personality,
is a force, but a spiritual one. It sums
up all the manifestations of the moral
and intellectual life of man . . . The
Fascist State is an inwardly accepted
standard and rule of conduct, a discip­
line of the whole person : it permeates
the will no less than the intellect. It
stands for a principle which becomes
the central motive of man as a member
of civilized society ; sinking deep down
into his personality; it dwells in the
heart of the man of action and of the
thinker, of the artist and of the man of
science : soul of the soul . . . ”
” It is Fascism which has refashioned
the character of the Italians, removing
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
impurity from our souls, tempering us to
all sacrifices, restoring the (¿rue aspect
of strength and beauty to our Italian
face.*1
Cultural Activities :
In August 1936 the new film city of
Cinelandia was in construction two
miles south of Rome, where films are to
be produced on a large scale. The first
film will be " Scipione Africano ” to
celebrate the foundation of the new
Italian Empire.
Italy is encouraging the artistic and
intellectual exchange of professors and
students, music and exhibitions, transla­
tion of literary and dramatic works with
neighbouring cultures. Notable works
of sculpture are Barone Eugenio’s
Monument of Christ on a tomb in
the cemetery of Genova, and Messina
Francesco’s statue of Cristoforo
Colombo.
Some recent musical works of great
merit are II Campiello by Ferrari,
Giulio Cesare and La Passtone (sacred)
by Malipiero; Cyrano di Bergerac
by Alfano, Nottumo Fantastico by
Mangiagalli; Paolo e Virginia by
Gavazzeni, Orseolo by Pizzetti.
Archaeological discoveries are con­
tinually revealing the wonders of
ancient civilizations, some of the more
recent dating back to 2,000 B.c.
Architecture notes the Forum Musso­
lini, the Church of Jesus in Rome, and
renovations and reconstructions of
architectural marvels, ancient and
modern, in Rome.
Remarkable progress has been made
in aviation: petrol consumption has
been reduced to 20 gr. of petrol per
passenger per km. at the velocity of 400
km. per hour. With trimotor and
quadrimotor for 20 passengers, Italy
has the fastest commercial service
existing, 400 km. per hour (Savoia-
Marchetti) and the fastest hydroplane
in the world, 70Q km. p. h. (Agello),
a Fiat-Macchi machine.
In Science the most notable recent
work is that of Marconi whose wireless
and ultra short or micro-waves are
revolutionizing many other sciences,
among them telephony. Augusto
Fermi has contributed researches on the
atom and the study of molecular
physics. The new science of Radio-
Biology held its first Congress Septem­
ber 1934, and reported on its systematic
study of all that vibrates and lives to
prove its conviction that the phenom­
ena of vibration and those of life are
intimately connected. Medicine re­
ports notable contributions towards the
cure of cancer by radio-action ; studies
of hematology (diseases of the blood and
tissues) ; discovery of meteoropathy or
disease in relation to meteorology;
and much work on the function and
therapy of the endocrinal glands. In­
dustrial science has manufactured wool
from residues of milk and woven
materials from the cellulose of broom
and other plants.
The ideal of Motherhood is dominant
in Italy, and bachelors are taxed heavily
to help to provide premiums for marri­
age, birth, and healthy and well-educat­
ed families.
The treaty between the Holy See and
Italy of 11 February 1929 has established
a close understanding between Church
and State and confirmed Roman Catho­
licism as the only State religion. How­
ever, freedom of other creeds and dis­
cussion on religious matters is freely
admitted.
Fascism on Religion : Matter was
on the altars for one century; today it
is spirit which takes its place . . . All
creations of the spirit—starting with
those religious—are coming to the fore
. . . By saying that God is returning,
we mean that spiritual values are re­
turning. ’ ’
“ The Fascist State sees in religion
one of the deepest of spiritual manifesta­
tions, and for thi§ reason it not only res­
pects religion but defends and protects
it . . . Fascism respects the God of
ascetics, saints, and heroes, but it also
respects God as conceived by the in­
genuous and primitive heartof the people,
the God to whom their prayers are
raised.’ ’ (Mussolini).
Theosophy in Ita ly :
General Secretary : A w . Tullio Cas-
tellani; 1934-.
History : The earliest record of Theos­
ophy in Italy is the formation of the
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 113
Milan Centre in 1891 and the Olevano
Murphy
1892-5. The first Lodge and lending
library was initiated 1897 in Rome
through the efforts of Mrs. C. A. Lloyd
as President and Signor Decio Calvari
as Secretary, and the same year noted a
Centre formed in Genoa. Shortly after
came Mrs. Cobper-Oakley, to whose
devoted efforts and capabilities in found­
ing other Lodges in Florence, Milan,
Naples, Rome, Palermo, Genoa, and
Torino, the Section owed its organiza­
tion, 1 February 1902, under the General
Secretaryship of Captain Oliviero Bog-
giani. Mrs. Cooper-Oakley’s work was
greatly aided by the visits in 1901-2 of
and G. N. Chakravartljand a stay of two
months by C^^JLiSSBe^igr who presid­
ed at the opening of the Section.
The Italian Section has always been
noted for the high quality of its Theoso­
phical literary activities, starting with
the Nuova Parola (New Word) founded
in the nineties, which presented studies
of literature, art and history from the
Theosophical viewpoint; the Bollettino,
first a Sectional organ, then a review ;
II Loto, founded by Contessa Gamberini,
in 1929, showing the Unity of life in
Philosophy, Science, and Art; and the
review Gnosi, presenting Theosophy
according to Italo-Mediterranean tradi­
tions. Tlfe Ars Regia, the Theosophi­
cal Publishing House, founded by Dr. G.
Sulli Rao ana Mrs. Cooper-Oakley, was
an invaluable means of spreading Theos­
ophy in the early years of The Society
in Italy, and no less so today is
Prometeo, founded at Turin, under
the inspiration of the Contessa Reg-
hini.
Special mention should be made of
the devotion of Prof. Otto Penzig, the
distinguished botanist, whose balanced
judgment and broad tolerance steered
the ship of Theosophy through the
difficult years 1905-1918. His high intel­

MEXICO
President of Republic: General
Lázaro Cárdenas, 1 December 1934—
30th November 1940.
National Summary:
Keynote : The Spirit of Freedom—
Loyalty-Beauty through Colour and
Rhythm.
Mexico’s history falls into three
epochs. Annexed to the Spanish Crown
by conquest in 1521, for three centuries
she was governed through 62 viceroyal­
ties. 1822-1911, nearly a century of
building and shaping of the life of the
independent nation ; the last or revolu­
tionary epoch, commenced with coups
d'état and civil war and culminated
in bold social and economic experiments.
Three great socio-economic revolu­
tions have rent Mexico asunder during
the last hundred years. The first, begun
in 1810 by Hidalgo, substituted native-
born for European-born Spaniards in
industry, resulting in still greater power
and wealth for the Church, which by
1821 owned one-half the wealth Of the
capital city. The second revolution, in­
spired by the great Indian president,
Benito Juarez, in 1854, at a time when
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L YEAR BOOK, 1937
414
the Church owned one-third of the real
property of the whole Republic, separat­
ed Church and State, but worked to the
advantage of the great landowners. The
third revolution begun in 1910 and
reaching a climax in the present Marxist
Socialistic regime of General Cárdenas,
is directed chiefly toward agrarian re­
form b^ the distribution of every tillable
inch of land among the Indian peasantry,
together with regulation of property,
a partnership between worker and
capitalist, and above all, a more ex­
pansive movement toward popular edu­
cation. (Over 27% of Budget so spent.)
The present Government has given niore
land to the peasantry than the peasants
ever seized for themselves, five million
acres to some 300,000 peasants, making
a total of 8,500,000 acres of cultivable
land and 20,000,000 acres of barren
territory distributed amongst 900,000
peasants. There still remain in Mexico
2,500,000 rural landless toilers.
Newly created industries are being
assisted to hold out until markets are
secured, and an attempt is being made
to eliminate foreign capital by a special
fund of fifteen million pesos administered
through “ The National Bank for Mort­
gages, City Development, and Public
Works,” newly created, which will grant
long-term loans to industries of national
importance.
The new Penal Code of 1930 abolished
the death penalty (except for Army),
and without the aid of Courts, a com­
mission of alienists and other specialists
study and 4*try ” criminals to see how
they can refit them into social life.
The present Government is '4deter­
mined to stamp out terrorism and is
working for the restoration of complete
religious and political freedom.”
“ To help the introduction of new
ideas, give more intiative and prevent
the formation of bureaucracy,” no
Governor of the Federated States can
be re-elected before two years have
elapsed from his last term of office.
(December 1935).
Cultural Activities:
“ Mexico—a land of contrasts—the
old and the new working side by side
. . . women washing clothes in a
stream which runs beside a powerful
railway, native festivals conducted to
the accompaniment of an American
radio. The old world and the new,
inexorably interwoven, producing a
series of contrasts like the bright, clash­
ing colours of the countryside itself.”
(iChristian Science Monitor).
A country with the traditions of the
ancient civilizations of the Aztecs and
Mayas, themselves descendants of the
Toltecs, all tracing in codices of stone
their origin as 44coming to this land
from the other side of the sea.” (The
keystone has been discovered by Dr.
Alfonso Caso in Oaxaca, the first to be
found in Mayan structures.) A country
which had had the teaching of the '4One
Unique God ” from the lips of its Aztec
King and Poet, Netzahualcóyotl, cen­
turies before the arrival of Christian
teachers. A people in which the Spirit
of Beauty finds expression through
Colour, Dance and Song. Such a
people are blending the old with the
new in the rebirth of a Nation.
T heosophy in M exico :
General Secretary: Dr. David R.
Cervera, 1935-.
History : The Theosophical seed was
sown by Victor Ramond of Cuba in
Mexiccuin^ 1906. Of the several scat­
tered Lodges" founded that year, Au
Ra is still active in Mexico City.
These Lodges were attached to the
Cuban Section until 24 February 1920
when the Section charter (dated 12
November 1919) was brought to Mexico
and Señor Agustín Garza Galindo, its
founder, was made first General Secre­
tary. Within the next two years the
Section expanded from eight to twenty-
three Lodges. In 1929 the lecture-tour
of Mr. Jinarajadasa stimulated a veritable
revival of spiritual thought in Mexico.
Though forbidden by the Church to at­
tend the lectures, large audiences crowd­
ed the halls, many of them women, young
people, and labourers—a very remark­
able sign of the awakening of national
consciousness. The 1931 and 1932 tours
of Señora Consuelo R. de Aldag, of the
U.S.A, were of great value. Several
of the Lodges own their own homes.
Headquarters in 1930 acquired a massive
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 U5
\
hotyse located in the very heart of
Mexico City, which is utilized by Theo-
sophical and allied movements every
day. A lecture hall and shrine are now
being built. This Headquarters owns
six beautiful pictures of the Founders
and leaders done in oil by Daniel del
Valle, a devoted member.
The Section pays tribute to the work
of Francisco Gômez Rul, José Queijero,
Adolfo Montoya, Francisco Diaz Qui-
jano, Mrs. Gertrudis de la Pena Vda
de Cisneros, Carolina M. de Becerra y
Castro, who have passed from physical
work ; and to the active workers José
Antonio Garro, Dr. Alfred Cuaron,
Augustin •Ponte y Blanco, Guillermo
Blanco, Ramiro Gomez Camacho, and
its devoted General Secretaries.
Propaganda: Beside the sectional
bulletin for members, a four-page leaf­
let Amistad has a wide monthly distri­
bution to non-members, among them
many Government officials. Year after
year thousands of leaflets are printed for
the public, on the Section’s own press,
(1935, over 100,000). Broadcasting and
excellent Press notices spread the ‘ ‘ pre­
sent Theosophical mood : Art and
Fraternization.”

Keynote : “ The Spirit of Common
Sense, of Probity, and of Receptivity
for Practical Idealism-” (G.S.A.)
The Netherlands ideal is first and
foremost Peace. The people are inter­
nationally minded and have given pro­
tection and freedom to refugees of all
times. Yet they never permit this
neutral sanctuary to be violated by
agitators fomenting plots against other
nations, and they deport all such as
undesirables. Holland is a country
peculiarly placed geographically and
spiritually. It might be said to hold the
spiritual balance as the middle pin of
the Northern European scales. Hol­
land has endeavoured to break down
economic and other barriers with neigh­
bouring countries. The scrupulous
sense of fairness and honour of the
people is indicated in the splendid
National Song, in which William the
Silent honours Phillip of Spain, his
most bitter enemy.
The Queen of the Netherlands is no
mere symbol of authority, but, actively
at the helm of State, knows the minutest
details of her entire Empire, internal
and colonial, and within herself em­
bodies all those qualities for which her
people are honoured : Tenacious, thrifty,
independent, a pioneer people, and
one of the most efficient in the
world in character, in equipment and
in achievement. The world knows how
Holland has defended her territories
through a masterly system of dykes
from the inroads of an ever-pres­
sing sea. During the last century,
through magnificent reclamation pro­
jects, 300,000 acres of water-beds, and
800,000 acres of waste land have been
transformed into cultivable and habit­
able land. The second stage of the
present Zuider Zee reclamation project
will be finished by 1951, and will add
another i 20,000 acres of fertile ground
for the use of the country’s fast in­
creasing population. The electrification
of the important railways will be com­
pleted before May 1938, and these
railways are soon to be nationalized.
Through many central economic bureaux
the State is making itself felt in all
fields of political and economic life.
The Nation is seriously exibining
the question of the country’s in­
dustrialization, and many hundreds of
millions of guilders have been spent
on public works of lasting value in
the past 25 years. Labour Camps are
giving the unemployed an opportunity
for rehabilitation through constructive
I t s T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L Y EA R BOOK, 1937
wort, and sinc#19 September 1916
a Government scheme of unemployment
insurance has been in effect. So deep
is the respect for the Judges of the land
that trial by jury is unknown.
The political emancipation of the
Calvinist and Catholic groups, the
renaissance and influence of the border­
ing Flemish culture, the organization
and rise in prosperity of the working
class—all these have added richness and
depth to the national consciousness.
Cultural Activities :
Beauty is expressed through home,
husbandry, and the arts. Everyday life
is artistically lived amidst beautiful
homes and gardehs. The Dutch kitchen
is not a prosaic but a delightful spot for
home-making.
One feature of culture in the Nether­
lands is the large number of prosperous
institutions for the encouragement of
science and the fine arts, most of them
founded 1750 to 1850. Many of these
associations are international in scope,
as for example the Institute of Language,
Geography and Ethnology of the Nether-
lands-Indies, founded in 1851, which
has contributed materially to the sympa­
thetic understanding existing between
Holland and her distant colonies.
No less than seventeen Nobel prizes
have been won by Dutch scientists, one
of the most outstanding pieces of work
being that approaching the Absolute
Zero in the Kamerlingh Onnes labora­
tory at Leyden. Another the work by
Prof. Gaumann, which proves that
plants develop abnormal temperatures
during illness,some diseases causing acute
rises, mechanical injuries and other
diseases only slow fevers, thus again
reminding us of the truth long known to
the occultist of the identity of all the
kingdoms of nature.
In aquatic sports Holland holds many
world records, in the winning of which
Willy 6en Ouden, the famous woman
swimmer, is pre-eminent.
Some greatcelebrations during 1935-6 :
A Rembrandt exhibition on 14 July 1935,
commemorating the 50th anniversary of
the opening of the Rijksmuseum ; the
Third Centenary of the University of
Utrecht on 22 June 1936 ; the opening
of the British Art Exhibition in Amster­
dam by the Duke of Kent on 4th /uly
1936; the two-day Congress of the
Nation, as well as a Convention of the
T.S. Section, to commemorate the fourth
centenary of the death of Desiderius
Erasmus, friend of Sir Thomas More.
The Dutch schools of painting are very
famous : Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Jan
Steen, Ruysdael, and Hobbema. Dutch
architecture is developing along new lines
made famous by Berlage, de Bazel
(F.T.S.), and Dudok. In Music modern
Holland excels, and nine Theosophists
are composers. Many Dutch composers
have world reputations, as for example,
Dr. Willem Mengelberg, leader of the
Amsterdam Orchestra.
The Netherlands language is an ex­
cellent medium for prose, poetry and
philosophy. The modern trend is sim­
plicity and directness. In fact the
cultural ideals of the national life as
a whole are simplicity and perfection
in living.
Theosophy in the Netherlands:
General Secretary: J. Kruisheer,
1931-.
History : The first Lodge in Holland
was the Post Nubila Lux T.S., founded
^ 1881 in The Hague by^Captain A*, de
T^urbpn.~ This Lodge existed through­
o u t the eighties, losing strength with the
passing of its founder in 1887. On the
1st November 189 0 ^ group was formed
in 4nJaterda.nL^study and propagate
Theosophy, atftohg whom were W. B.
Fricke, Mr, and Mrs. Wierts van
Coehoorn, and Mrs. P. C. Meuleman,
“ the mother of Theosophy in Holland.”
In January 1891 a charter was obtained
from the English Section for a Dutch-
Belgian Subsection. Soon after, the
house in Amsteldyk 76 was rented and
this became the centre of administration,
propaganda, and study, as well as the
dwelling-place of eight or nine students
wljo worked there under the guidance
of Mrs. Meuleman. Other centres
mentioned in 1891 were Amheim, Cour-
celles, and The Hague. Several books
were translated into Dutch by Mrs.
A. S. Obreen toe Laer, and in May,
1892, the first number of the monthly
Theosophia appeared. Gradually the
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 ‘ 117
movement spread through the Nether­
lands and Belgium, Other future Section
leaders came into the ranks :* Mr. Johan
van Manen in 1895 at Haarlem, Miss
Dtjkgraaf in 1896; Mj-s. Windust, A. J.
Cnoop Koopmans, J. P. W. Schuurman,
Mrs. Ramondt-Hirschmann, Mevrouw
van Eeghen-Boissevain, Dr. van der
Leeuw, and many others.
The Belgian Lodges grew numerous
enough to have their own movement,
and in 1897 the Dutch Section was
chartered, the first meeting being held
on 18 July, G. R. S. Mead installing
W. B. Fricke as General Secretary.
The printing of Theosophical trans­
lations was organized by the founding
by H. J. van Ginkel of the Theosophical
Publishing House. The movement
grew steadily and surely until by 1929 a
Theosophical Temple and adjacent
structures, centralizing all Theosophical
and allied activities, was founded on
grounds near the old Headquarters
which is now devoted solely to housing
workers. A European Congress was
held at Amsterdam in 1935. Many great
Theosophists have contributed through
their lecture tours to the upbuilding of
the Section ; the Ommen Star Camp has
left a spiritual impress on the country ;
and greatest of all recent focuses of
spiritual life in the Netherlands is St.
Michael's Centre at Naarden, Huizen,
which co-ordinates Theosophical im­
pulses in the Northern Hemisphere.

Propaganda : The Section from its.
earliest yfcars has taken Theosophy into
every sphere of life, rather than sitting'
in its Lodges waiting for a reluctant
world to storm its doors. In the first
year of The Society’s existence (1890)
the Wilhelmina Catherina School to
bring Theosophy to the youth of Amster­
dam was founded by Mr. Fricke, intro­
ducing the comparatively unknown
Froebel Kindergarten systeni. Today
the Huizen School at Drafna carries on
the spread of Theosophy among the
Netherland youth. A strong Youth
Movement is making a platform of friend­
ship whereon it is possible for small
groups of diametrically opposed young
people to “ come together differently.”
This is having a far-reaching effect on
the youth of the Nation and its ultimate
outlook on its future responsibilities.
The radio and all modern methods of
propaganda are utilized to the fullest
extent.
The International Centre in Huizen
has been producing a series of interesting
“ National Festivals,” the first being
devoted to The Netherlands. These
Festivals express the ruling spirit of each
Nation with an intimate understanding
of its finest tones. International bodies
devoted to Brotherhood and the better­
ment of the world find a responsive
home here, all aiding The Netherlands
towards her cultural and spiritual
goal.

opment. A movement in 1910 started
the political renaissance of the Indone­
sian people, and they are steadily
growing toward autonomy, assisted
wisely and tactfully by an understanding
Government.
Cultural Activities:
The Netherlands Indies constitute a
bridge between the Asiatic and Australian
continents and civilizations. Flora and
fauna are blended in a proportion of
80%. Asiatic and 20% distinctly Austra­
lian. The population is blended in

118 T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L YEA R BOOK, 1937
somewhat the same proportions, inclu­
ding of course a large number of Euro­
peans. Advanced culture is found
in Java, Sumatra, and Bali. Three
currents of civilization have met in
Indonesia : the Hindu-Buddhistic, the
Mohammedan, and the Christian. Up
to the 15th century Java and Sumatra
formed -a very prosperous Hindu-Bud­
dhistic Kingdom; their great kings are still
famed in legend for wisdom and valour.
Then came the penetration of Islam,
which is now the predominant culture
in the land» though the art, literature and
popular customs of ancient Java are
still highly honoured. This may account
for the ready response of the people to
Theosophical ideals and ideas. Many
monuments still remain from that
glorious period of history, the most
wonderful being the splendid Boro-
boedoer, a mighty monument relating
in its sculptures the history of the
Prince-Teacher, Gautama Buddha.
Scattered over Java and Sumatra are
many other, less known, but magnificent
remains of temples, palaces, and monu­
ments, which make Java an Eldorado
for archaeologists and for history-loving
tourists.
Government has splendidly met the
problem of the fifty odd languages
spoken (the principal of which are
Dutch, Malay, Javanese, Sudanese,
Arabic and Chinese) by establishing
schools in the native tongues for a seven
years’ education, then link-schools with
a five-year course of instruction, follow­
ed by schools of higher and technical
training. Every effort is made (see
The Netherlands) to study and preserve
the indigenous cultures, and in conse­
quence the people live natural, happy
lives, free to express themselves at their
highest.
Theosophy in Indonesia:
General Secretary : A. J. H. van

History; H. P. Blavatsky, greatly

of Central visited the Islands in
_|852 and I860. In 1881 theTeSalongan
TheosopTiT6aT!‘'Society was chartered
with Baron von Tengnagel as its presi­
dent. After his passing in 1893 Theos­
ophy slumbered in Java, to be awakened
again in 1901 through a Lodge found­
ed at SeMfEffg by P. A. van Asperen
van de Velde which was attached to the
Netherlands Section. In May 1909 the
Indonesian Section was formed as a
Sub-Section of the Netherlands Section,
at the suggestion of K. van Gelder
during the first Theosophical Congress
of 1908. In 1911, the tour of C. W.
Leadbeater, accompanied Sy Joh^^SIf
well organized by D. van
Hinloopen Labberton, stimulated the
founding of an independent Netherlands-
Indies Section, which was granted a
charter 5 April 1912, with Mr. Labberton
as first General Secretary. The subse­
quent visits of Bishop Leadbeater,
1914, 1926, and 1929, several visits
(the last in 1936) of C. Jinarajadasa,
and Bishop Mazel, that of Dr.

T~T933‘“'T936T" have been of
inestimable value in building up the
Section to its present strength of 26
active Lodges and 9 centres, with a
total active membership of 1,335—a 4
net increase of 95 members in the year
1936.
Some events in the life of the Section :
The sending of the Wajang dancers
with a gamelan orchestra to the Golden
Jubilee Convention in Adyar, to give
their beautiful dances interpreting epi­
sodes of the life of Rama ; the founding
of a Banking Corporation in 1934 to
prove a strong barrier against the
/financial collapse then threatening
/members, the Lodges and their many
fine headquarters, and the Section
itself.
Propaganda: Theosophy has been
carried to the people of Indonesia
through many and varied vehicles:
Tours and Summer Schools, a growing
Section Library ; a magnificent system
of Theosophical schools with a range of
training from infant to college and
technical work; a movement of the
Friends of Light (Pemitran Tjahja) now
numbering over a thousand members,
which takes Theosophy out among the
common people and gives them its
blessed wisdom; the publication of
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 119
bulletins and journals in five languages,
and a handbook in two.
One of the outstanding features of
Theosophy’s expression h a s b e e n
through Beauty, The} Javanese people,
having an inborn sense of beauty and
art, quickened and fed by the natural
loveliness of their land, find an easy
expression for their inner life in music
and drama. The highest Theosophical
ideals and ancient occult teachings are
thus brought into daily life through the
art of the Drama-Dance, the Wajang-
Wong, performed by individuals, and
by the Wajang-Koelit, the Shadow-
Play. The European members in Java
no less than their Javanese brethren
have worked along the line of revealing
and teaching Theosophy through the
drama. ( T a b l e a u x , mysterv-plays,
eurhythmic dances, were created by the
members, their artistic capacities utilized
i to the full in devising beautiful stage
^ and lighting effects, designing artistic
i programmes and exquisite costumes and
jewelry. To see these beautiful perfor­
mances, halls have been packed not only
once but many times thrice. In this ,
way the Netherlands Indies Section has
for many years brought into this link
between North and South the special
asPect of ThegsophXJaBegalau..
~~0rilyTne wholehearted devotion of the
members in unlimited generosity and
unwearied labour could have achieved
these magnificent results. *

youthful and beautiful setting.” (G.S.A.)
New Zealand is one of the outstand­
ing nations in the progressive manner in
which she has faced and dealt with the
problems of economics and of wise ad­
ministration not only of her white
citizens but the primitive peoples en­
trusted to her care. New Zealand was
the first State to admit women to the
polls, in 1893, more than forty years
ago, and in 1919 women were eligible
to the House of Representatives. The
native Maoris are eligible to vote for
their own Maori members of the House
of Representatives. The ” goodwill ”
visit of a Government delegation in
July 1936 to hear the people's difficulties
in the Island of Samoa (a mandated
territory) and the liberal concessions
made by Government to the people, in­
cluding remission of tax arrears, the
right to home rule movements, etc.,
have brought the Samoan people again
into harmonious co-operation with the
Administration. The King Edward
VIII, a newly annexed Island in the
Phoenix Group, just south of the
Equator and six hundred miles north of
Samoa, is to be administered by New
Zealand.
After a phenomenal recovery from the
depression, the Budget for 1934-5 re­
vealed a surplus of ¿8,000. The un­
employment situation was met not only
by temporary relief measures but by
absorbing men into permanent employ­
ment through encouraging existing in­
dustries and developing new ones.
The aim of the present Labour
Government is “ to guarantee to every
person able and willing to work an in­
come sufficient to provide a comfortable
home and home life.” Every effort is
being made, therefore, to broaden and
deepen an already liberal scheme of
social security. New Zealand’s old-
age pension system dates back to 1898.
In August 1936, Government outlined
the new Budget in which the old-age
pension is raised to ¿1 weekly ; an in­
valid pension is established of ¿1 weekly
with 10s, for a wife and each dependent
child ; and other pensions and family
allowances are improved. A three-year
programme of public works to develop
railways, highways, roads, harbours,
and aerodromes and a substantial in­
crease in sustenance and relief work rates
for the unemployed will rehabilitate
the few remaining workless citizens.

During a short session of eleven
weeks, concluded 11 June 1936, the fol­
lowing measures were passed : (1) The
conversion of the Reserve Bank to com­
plete State ownership control, with
provision for State control of credit and
exchange and the financing of guaran­
teed prices; (2) Conversion of the
Mortgage Corporation"to State ownership
with enlarged powers of borrowing and
lending ; (3) Guaranteed prices for ex­
ported dairy produce with marketing
control of internal trade of primary pro­
ducts ; (4) Abolition of the Boards of

transport, and broadcasting which come
under direct ministerial authority ; «(5)
' Far-reaching amendments to industrial
law, including a restoration of com­
pulsory arbitration and the introduction
of compulsory trade unionism, a basic
wage, and a provisional 40-hour week.
This experiment in Government might
be termed a blend of Liberalism and
Socialism.
Cultural Activities:
Within a space of about 1,000 square
miles is to be found not only the impress
of subtropical beauty in North Island but
fjords, glacial caverns, and majestic
mountains that border the Antarctic
circle in the Island of the South. And
yet- the people have made of it another
England, an England of beautiful gar­
dens and picturesque homes, an England
with the traditions of centuries of cul­
ture. And in this blending of old and
new is developing the Sixth Subrace
(see Australia and America), New
Zealand having her special part to play
in its unfoldment. Some of the more
important artistic activities of the year
are ; Maori Portraits by E. Goldie of
Auckland, hung in the Royal Academy
in 1935 and 1936. The first dramatic
film made in New Zealand On the
Friendly Road, completed in Auckland
1936 by R. Hayward. Dennis Dowling
of Dunedin won the baritone solo
competition at the London Musical
Festival in 1936. New Zealand is pro­
ducing many young composers whose
work includes songs and orchestral and
chamber music. Two Compositions
yrorthy of mention produced during
1935-6 are Trio by Eric Waters (com­
poser of Abbess of Whitby), and The

History : The first Lodge in New
Zealand was formed in Wellington by
E, P. Sturdy in 1888, of Which John
Sinclair, of a welt-khOwn Auckland

The Auckland Lodge was founded 1891,
and its president in 1894-5 was Miss
Lilian Edger, a name inseparable from
the history of Theosophy in Australasia,
Among other names closely associated
with the early history are Rev. S. J.
Neill (Presbyterian Minister), Mr. Betts,
Dr. C. W. Sanders, the Draflins, the
Rt. Rev. J. R. Thomson. Thanks to
the help of the Countess Wachtmeister,
the Section was formed 7 April 1896,
with Miss Edger its first General
Secretary. Of the first Lodges there
are still active Christchurch (1894),
Dunedin (1893), Wellington (1894),
Wanganui (1896), besides many other
Lodges founded in the early twentieth
century. Many of the Lodges own
their own buildings.
Theosophist leaders and other over­
seas workers have assisted New Zealand,

* Propaganda: Lectures and distri­
bution of literature through many

Lodge, Auckland.
The Youth Movement is very vital,
not only in the beautiful Vasanta
Garden School, now in its 18th year,
but also in the Round Tablé with its
creditable monthly, The Torch, and in
the dramatic performances given by
young people 1
‘ which illustrate most
effectively the ideals of Theosophy.”
The Order of Service is particularly
active ip Peace, Drama, Health, and
Animal Welfare Groups. New Zealand
is a stronghold of Theosophy.
NORWAY
R eign in g S ov ereign : Haakon VII,
second son of the King of Denmark,
elected to the Throne by a plebiscite in
1905 after the formal establishment of
Norway as an independent Kingdom.
N ational S u m m ary:
Keynote : “ Nearness to Nature, Simpli­
city, Spirit of Adventure.” (G.S.A.)
Norway’s Sovereign is in the rare
positiori of being the choice of an over­
whelming majority of his people to set
up a new dynasty. The King’s Motto,
” All for Norway,” is a mark not only
of his own life and that of other members
of the Royal family, but is reflected in
the outlook of Cabinet and Storting
(Parliament) which assist in the adminis­
tration of this steady, strong, and pro­
gressive nation. (The Budget of 1936-7
reveals substantial allotments to social
improvement, and the most generous
of any single item on the Budget is
” Church, education, and the arts.” )
Queen Maud and Crown Princess
Martha, untiring in social service, and
the Crown Prince Olav, educated with
his fellow citizens in the public schools,
are beloved by all the people.
Municipal suffrage was granted to
women in 1901, parliamentary suffrage
in 1907 (the first women in a sovereign'
country in Europe to obtain the vote),
and since 1913 women have been entitled
to full suffrage equality with men.
Women in Norway are now appealing
for the right to become ministers of the
gospel and army officers, a proposition
accepted by one Chamber, but rejected
by the other. Illegitimate children have
equal rights of inheritance with legiti­
mate, except for peasants’ farms, and
heavy paternal obligations are imposed
for the protection of such children and4
their mothers. Arbitration before litiga­
tion is a recognized principle in legal
procedure, and town and district com­
missions of mediation attempt to adjust
all civil disputes, thereby greatly reduc­
ing the number of cases which find their
way to courts of law. The death penalty
has been abolished.
Inventions and discoveries of far-
reaching economic importance have
been made, and particularly noteworthy
ones deal with refrigeration, navigation,
fishing, timber felling, and electro­
chemistry. (Whaling through electro­
cution has been made painless.)
A growing rapprochement is evident
between Scandinavian countries which
have much of idealism and interest in
common.
Cultural A c tiv it ie s :
Before one can appreciate the cul­
tural life of Norway, one must
know Norway : Land of majestic moun­
tains, at whose feet course reverently
fjords of sapphire blue overshot with
pearl of glacier stream, and cascading
from whose peaks spray down mystic
veils of diamond drops, her waterfalls.
And over all the Midnight Sun, Such
beauty dreams through the life of the
people and expresses itself in an exu­
berant flood of art, music, and literature
that is epoch-making in its scope.
Such men as Kierulf, Grieg, Svendsen,
and Sinding in the musical field created
epochs. Monrad Johansen, Norway’s
most eminent living composer, Arne
122 T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
Eggen, Johan Backer-Lunde, Fridtjof
Backer Grondahl, Trygve Torjussen,
Fartein Valen, Pauline Hall, Anne-
Marie Orbeck (a young girl) carry on
the tradition of genius. There is a ten­
dency among Norwegian composers to
employ ‘1advanced ’ ’ harmonies and
rhythmic treatment, through which is
being unfolded a typical national music.
Nils Geirr Tveit (a new name), contin­
ues in his great work, The Dreams of
Baldur, an ancient Norse-Germanic
Saga. There is a strong interest in
opera, and the Norwegian singer, Kirs­
ten Flagstad, has won triumphs in
Wagnerian performances at the Metro­
politan Opera House, New York. The
Bach Jubilee was celebrated by a chorus
of 3,000.
Gustav Vigeland, Norway’s greatest
sculptor, in whose colossal studio one
walks through a forest of sculpture, is
now completing a monumental fountain
at Frogner, which depicts hundreds of
grouped and single figures, from age to
children at play, an expression of vivid
life. Architecture is monumental in
power, the recently completed Odd­
fellows Home in Oslo giving the im­
pression of a huge rock. The new
City Hall in Oslo and the restoration
of the Nidaros Cathedral at Trondheim
are projects in progress.
Painters are concentrating on social
topics, the national peace movement
stimulating a fine exhibition of paintings.
The altar-painting in Linköping’s
Cathedral by Henrik Sorensen is a
magnificent piece of work. The central
figure, a young and radiant Christ with
arms outstretched, surrounded by an
aura of shining colours, depicts the
artist’s vision of a timeless and cosmic
Christ. Norway’s greatest artist, Ed­
ward Munch, whose influence on the
younger generation has been incalcul­
able, despite his seventy years, is still
hard at work.
The Art of Handicraft Associa­
tion, a guild of workers, are reviving
beauty and simplicity in industry. A
recent achievement in craftsmanship is
a simple device which gives any violin
the full rich tones of a precious old
instrument.
Norway has produced many other
figures of world-wide reputation.
Among these are the poets Ibsen and
Bjornson, the violinist Ole Bull, the
painter Hans Gude, the explorers
Fridtjof Nansen and Roald Amundsen,
the mathematician Niels Henrik Abel,
and the physicist Kristian Birkeland.
Theosophy in Norway :
General Secretary : Fru Dagny Zadig,
1936-.
History : The first Lodge in Norway
was The Norwegian Lodge in Kristiania,
1893, G. Elfwing, president, and H.
^7ThfiTe,'"'secretary. Kristiania Lodge was
chartered 6-10-1905, Rich Eriksen pre­
sident, and Bergen Lodge, 1-3-1909.
From 1911 until the chartering of the
Section 8 October 1913, nine Lodges
were formed. Miss Eva Blytt became
the first General Secretary. Many
visitors have assisted the Section
in Norway, including recently Mr.
Edwin Bolt, Miss Jean Glen-Walker,
Mi\ Jinarajadasa (1935) and the Presi­
dentAhd Shrimati Rukmini Devi in i 936.
Propaganda: A vigorous effort has
been put into the Straight Theosophy
Campaign and all the literature has
been translated and published. The
Section Journal Norsk Teosohsk Tid-
skrift holds the scattered Lodges and
members together, and every effort is
made to keep the Journal at a high
level. A youth group is working at
Oslo for whom has been translated The
Spirit of Youth by the President. The
Summer School of 1935 was attended
by members from seven countries,, and
that of 1936, coincident with the Pre­
sidential visit, was an outpouring of
Theosophic life into the national con­
sciousness.
PABAGUAY
Provisional President of the Re­

in office by a military junta, 18
February 1936.
National Summary :
The Paraguayans are a brave and in­
dependent people, descendants of the
ancient Indians (Guaranis) and Spanish

adventurers who conquered the country-
in 1527. The territory of Paraguay in
the sixteenth cQ ^^y c o m p r i s e d
Uruguay, parts of Brazil, and a large
portion of Argentina. , Spain ceded a
part of this territory to Portugal. In
1811 Paraguay declared itself an in­
dependent Republic. An exhausting
war was waged with the neighbouring
territories in 1864, which reduced the
population from over a million to 28,746
men, 106,254 women over 15 years, and
86,079 children. In 1919 Paraguay
joined the League of Nations. An age­
long border dispute between Bolivia and
Paraguay, leading to armed conflicts
over a period of years, was settled
through the arbitration of South Ameri­
can members of the League, and a
treaty of peace was signed at Buenos
Aires on 22 January 1936.
The present Government came into
power as the result of a military, revolt.
Col. Franco immediately set about
establishing a “ Totalitarian State.”
All industries were placed under the
control of the Minister of the Interior,
and the Party and the State were de­
clared to be inseparable. The Platform
and programme of the National Re­
volutionary Party are : Amendment of
the country’s Constitution (dating from
1870) ; abolition of class distinctions
and privileges; protection for home
industries ; nationalization of certain
services and *‘ necessity ’ ’ industries ;
special law for the protection of peasants
and workers ; more extensive education
for the masses ; new laws govefning the
ownership of land ; a minimum standard
of living / for rural and working-class
families. A decree was signed 6 May
1936 providing for the expropriation
of four million acres of unused land
which will be distributed a m o n g
peasants.
Cultural Activities:
Education is free and nominally com­
pulsory, and since 1935 provision has
been made for adult schools. Secondary
schools and a National University
provide higher educational facilities.
The Roman Catholic Church is the
established religion of the State, but«
the free exercise of other religions is
permitted.
Theosophy in Paraguay:
The first Lodge in Paraguay was
chartered in 1912, Destellos de Oriente»
at Asuncion, Viriato Diaz Perez, Presi­
dent, and José Marsal Secretary. With
Uruguay and Argentina, Paraguay
united in the formation of the Argentine
Section 18 January 1920. In 1929,
during the visit of Mr. Jinarajadasa,
Paraguay was chartered as an indepen­
dent Section, with José Marsal as
General Secretary. But because of
extremely difficult economic conditions,
the Section in 1931 dropped to Federa­
tion status, and finally to one Lodge,
an isolated outpost of Theosophy.
PERU
President of Republic : General
Don Oscar Raimundo Benavides, 30
Ap. 1933 to 8 December 1936.
National Summary:
A strong, brave and beauty-loving
people in a land whose tradition dates
not only to an Inca Empire, but still
older civilizations “ of the Sun.”
The Republic of Peru, formerly the
most important of the Spanish Vice­
royalties in South America, issued its
Declaration of Independence on 28 July
1821 and in 1824 gained its actual free­
dom. Among other provisions of the
new Constitution of 9 April 1933, voting
is compulsory for all literate males be­
tween 21 and 60 years. Members of
“ political parties of an international
character ’ ’ are disqualified from hold­
ing public office.
A recent boundary dispute between
Peru and Colombia was amicably settled
by a League of Nations Commission 27
September 1935.
To promote the assimilation of the
Indian population, estimated at four
million, the Government in 1930 de­
clared June 24 of each year to be a
national holiday, “ day of the indigene,”
to be celebrated with appropriate
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
124 *
ceremonies. By a decree issued in 1927,
the Indians were freed from the peonage
system which existed in some regions.
Cultural Activities :
Determined efforts have been made
by Government in behalf of the public
health. Elementary education is free and
-compulsory for both sexes between the
ages of 7 and 14. Thé system is highly
■centralized, all teaching appointments
being made by the Ministry of Educa­
tion. There are special schools for the
Indians ; also 30 travelling schools.
Higher education is normally provided
at the Universidad de San Marcos in
Dima, founded by Charles V in 1551, and
four other universities and State Colleges
irof Agriculture, Arts and Trades, and
Engineering. Religious liberty exists,
but the Roman Catholic religion is
protected by the State, and in 1929 a
decree was issued permitting only Roman
Catholic religious instruction in schools,
State or private. All marriages are civil,
regardless of religion, and preceded by
medical examination. Liberal divorce
laws operate.
To trace the culture of the highly
civilized Inca Empire predating the
Spanish Conquest in the early sixteenth
century, we must go to contemporary
records such as those written by
Garcilaso de la Vega whose mother was
of the Inca blood-royal, and many
others. Since this period Peruvian
literature has been unbroken and of a
high standard. Among the many
writers of he twentieth century, three
Stand out pre-eminent : Ricardo Palma
(1832-1919), who recreated anecdotes
of the colonial period in six volumes
of Tradiciones Perunanas, a trea­
sure house of Peruvian history and
culture ; Manual Gonzales Prada (1848-
1918), poet, radical philosopher, and
essayist ; and José Santos Chocano
(1875- ), a poet of a new literary school,
who derives inspiration from the geo­
graphy, history, flora, fauna, legends
and mythology of Peru. Literature since
the declaration of the Republic has been
studied by José de la Riva Aguero in
Caracter de la literatura del Peru
independiente and by Ventura Garcia
Calderon in his anthology, Del Roman-
ticismo al Modernismo. Francisco
García Calderón is internationally known
for essays on contemporary history,
philosophy and literature. There are
a host of younger writers in Peru,
some of whom, like Luis Alberto
Sánchez (1901-), have already attained
fame.
Among contemporary men of learning
may be mentioned Julio C. Tello and
Luis E. Valcarcel (archaeology) ; H. H.
Urteaga and Carlos Wiesse (history);
Victor M. Maúrtua (jurisprudence) ;
Federico Villarreal (mathematics) ; and
Oscar Miró Quesada (philosophy). A
recently developed type of architecture
(neo-Peruvian) combines Inca and Span­
ish colonial characteristics. There are
several artists of international reputation,
such as Carlos Bacaflor. Among com­
posers, J. Valle-Riestra has written
several operas, the most famous of
which, Ollanta, was inspired by the
Indian music of the sierra.
Ruins of vast edifices at Tiahuanaco,
south of Lake Titicaca, at Cuzco and
at Olíantaitambo, about whose origin no­
thing is known, are entirely unlike the
structures built in the 13th to 15th cen­
turies by the Incas or V people of the
Sun.” Madame Blavatsky calls atten­
tion in The Secret Doctrine to the start­
ling resemblance between the architec­
ture of these colossal buildings and that
of the archaic European nations ; to the
striking similarity of the sacred mysteries
of the Mayas and the Quichés to the
rites and beliefs of Ancient Egypt;
to the upturning of fossil skulls in
Europe, reverting closely to the type of
the ancient Peruvian; to the old
Peruvian tradition that “ the Incas,
seven in number, repeopled the earth
after the deluge,” as giving direct
evidence of a former Atlantic Con­
tinent bridging Northwest Africa and
South America. Occult investigations
reveal an ancient Peruvian civilization
about 12,000 b .c . under wise and benefi­
cent priests and rulers, who, with a deep
sense of responsibility, under an ideal
Governmental system of social security,
developed to the fullest possible measure
the capacities of a happy child-like
people.

Theosophy in Peru :
The first Lodge at Lima was chartered
8 August 1903, with,v.José Arturo Ego-
"Sgïïïïre, “P re sid e n tiFederico Valles
Varges, secretary. A IÇarma Lodge was
founded in 1914. In 1924, the H.P.B.
Lodge in Lima joined the Argentine Sec­
tion. At the time of Mr. Jinarajadasa’s
visit in 1929 five Lodges were in exis-
125
tence; he personally installed three others
and a chatter was granted to the Section
with A. Benavente Alcazar as General
Secretary. Though enthusiastic during
its initial years, the young Section has
been unable as yet to consolidate its
position as a Sectional entity,, and the
last report lists one strong Lodge, a
nucleus for a future Section.
PHILIPPINES
President of Commonwealth:
Manuel Quezon, elected 17 Sept. 1935
to serve 15 Nov. 1935-41. American
High Commissioner : Frank Murphy,
who, relinquishing his post as Governor-
General in which he had served from
15 June 1933, took office 15 Nov. 1935.
His functions are chiefly liaison, between
Manila and Washington.
National Summary:
Keynote: Idealism, Craftsmanship,
Friendliness.
The newly formed Commonwealth
is undergoing a preliminary ten-year
training period under an Ordinance
regulating relations between itself and
the United States, until 15 November
1945, when the Commonwealth auto­
matically becomes the fully sovereign
“ Philippine Republic.” Its new Con­
stitution, accepted by the Philippine
Legislature on 1 May 1934, provides for
a President, elected for six years (and
ineligible for immediate re-election) and
a single-chambered National Assembly.
The President has only limited powers
of veto. Suffrage is enjoyed by all
literate or propertied adult males.
Women, enfranchised from 1 January
1935 under a previous law, adopted in
November, 1933, must now under the
new Constitution ratify a desire for
woman suffrage by a female vote of
300,000. The Constitution vdsts in the
Commonwealth all ownership of the
country’s natural resources which, apart
from agricultural land, may not be
alierihted, and the National Assembly
' has extensive power for the development
of these resources, as well as such
domestic matters as health, education,
and the promotion of general welfare.
9
To assist the young Commonwealth
the United States returned seventeen
million dollars from excise tax collec­
tions on cocoanut oil towards its thirty
million dollar annual Budget, and C on­
gress voted twenty-three million dollars
as compensation for the devaluation of
the dollar.
The Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army
has been requested by the Common­
wealth to organize the defences of the
new Government and is endeavouring
through a system of training of boys and
girls over ten in physical fitness, sanita­
tion, and elementary drill, together
with compulsory military service at
twenty, to build up the country’s inter­
nal defensive resources. At the same
time teachers are working to create a
national spirit among the 43 tribes
speaking 87 dialects, and most of all
they are attempting to give this fine
people confidence in their ability to
undertake the difficult task of Self-
Government.
Cultural Activities:
The dominant religion of the islands
is the Roman Catholic, which numbers
almost ten million adherents. But in
1902, an independent Filipino Church
was founded, which has grown from one
and a half million adherents in 1918 to
over four million in the last Church
Census. This Church, while using a
ritual similar to that of the Roman
Church, adheres to modern science, pro­
claiming that science is superior to
Biblical tradition ; denies the possibility
of miracles ; and conceives God as an
invisible Father with one essence and a
single person. Latin was originally
prescribed, but now Spanish is the
126 T H E TH E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
official tongue, and encouragement is
given to the vernacular dialects. Marri­
age is allowed to its apostles. 150,000
Protestants, 24,263 Buddhists, and
443,037 Mohammedans complete the
religious Census.
The expenditure on public-school
education for 1931 was seventeen million
dollars, or half the entire expenditure
of the Commonwealth. This provided
for 7,671 public schools with 188
American and 26,769 Filipino teachers,
7 provincial normal schools, a num­
ber of .special technical schools, 27
provincial trade schools and 24 agri­
cultural school^, together with 179 farm
settlen^nt schools, and the University
*o£ the Philippines with 499 professors.
Besides Government schools there are
35 private institutions of higher learning,
among them the University of St.
Tomas founded in 1611, and 404 other
private schools all accredited. An effort
is made to unify the people through the
common language— English.
Theosophy in The P hilippines :
General Secretary : Ismael S. Zapata,
1933-,
History : The first Lodge in the
Philippines was chartered inJJJ92-.in
Manila and noted until l£93”under the
active leadership of B. C. Bridger,
attached to the American Section. The
movement was revived through the
organization of Manila Lodge 19 May
1925 by Lieut, (now Capt.) Devereux
M. Myers, President, and F. L, Minton,
Secretary. Its ten members belonged to
seven nationalities : American, Jewish,
German, English, East Indian. Russian,
and Filipino. The second Lodge was
on the Island of Cebu, and largely
composed of professional men ; the
third, Lotus Lodge in Manila, were 90%
spiritualists. The José Rizal, Soliman,
Nueva Ecija of Muftoz, and Filipinas
Lodges completed the seven needed
Lodges, and on 5 November 1933 the
Section was formed with the present
General Secretary. Mr. Hodson gave
a series of lectures in 1933 to large
audiences. A Youth Group of univer­
sity students was formed the same
year.
Propaganda : Through The Lotus
journal, edited by Benito Reyes ;
through a translation into Tagalog, the
most widely known dialect, by Geo. and
Elinore Ragan, and through lectures
and classes, this youngest Section of
The Theosophical Society is spreading
Theosophy in the young Nation.

N ational Su m m ary:
Keynote: "Mysticism, Art, Endur­
ance, Freedom." (GS.A.)
Flags were flown on all public
buildings 23 April 1935 to herald the
birth of a new Constitution, describ­
ed by its authors as " a happy
medium between pure Parliament­
ary democracy on the one hand, and
the Totalitarian State on the other."
This Constitution confers great power
upon the President, and provides for a
Diet which is an expression of the
Nation’s opinion (the nominees for elec­
tion chosen by professional syndicates
such as Chambers of Commerce, Agri­
culture, etc.) and a Senate made up of
- persons of civic or military distinction,
together with men eminent in the econo­
mic and social life of the nation. Free­
dom of conscience and the right to vote
are granted to all citizens, and every
citizen of Poland’s many minorities has
the right of preserving his nationality
and developing his mother tongue. An
Amnesty Bill of 16 December 1935
released some 30,000 political prisoners.
During the last five years the Republic
has completed an almost entire unifica­
tion of the civil and criminal law codes.
January 1934 ushered in a unification
of former Social Insurance in a compre­
hensive scheme designed to bring secu­
rity to industrial and office workers for
Health, including maternity, invalidity,
old age, orphan, widow, unemployment,
and compulsory industrial accident and
disease insurance. Poland’s Premier is

self rewards cleanliness and honesty in
the peasant markets.
Through the strong guiding hand of
the late Marshal JosefPilsudski, Poland
has established an absolutely impartial
friendship with her great Russian and
German neighbours. Of Pilsudski the
President said :, 1‘ He was king of our
hearts and master of our desires. By
his life-work he freed us from chains.”
Pilsudski nominated his s u c c e s s o r ,
General Rydz-Smigly, who is now ac­
claimed by Premier and President as
Poland’s “ first citizen.” His aim for
Poland is 4‘ The creation of a powerful
and united organization of patriots
which will represent the unique, un­
contested will of the nation.”
A new Four-Year Plan for unemploy­
ment relief will spend £ 70,000,000 be­
tween 1936 and 1940 for the economic and
financial reconstruction of the country.
Labour camps are inculcating patriotic
principles in youth.
Cultural A c tiv it ie s :
A train of 57 wagons is touring the
country with a permanent exhibition
of the industrial, agricultural, and cul­
tural life ¿of Poland, so that every man,
woman, and child may become alive to
the national treasures. A treaty with
Hungary established a cultural entente
for the exchange of professors, students,
and literary and scientific works. Poland
gave the world of science Mme Curie,
taught by her Polish father, Prof.
Sklodovska ; the world of music Chopin,
Moskowski, Paderewski, Szymanowski,
Wieniawski, Godowsky, Rosenthal—
the list is extensive.

On 19 March 1933 the Estata Nova
Constitution, providing for a Dictator­
ship on a Corporative * basis was adopt­
ed, with Dr. Antonio de Oliveira Sala­
zar, Prime Minister and Minister of
Finance, as Dictator. Dr. Salazar
prophesies that in twenty or thirty years
there will not be a single parliament
with legislative powers. “ An assembly
cannot work seriously. It is contrary to
the fundamental exigencies of human

given to literate or propertied men and
educated women. Secret Societies are
regulated and in some instances prohi­
bited. Capital punishment, except in
time of war, is abolished.
The Portuguese are essentially a
pioneering and colonizing people. The
nineteenth century marked a period of
crusades and discoveries, culminating
in marking out an ocean route to India
in 1499. In the next century Portugal
acquired a foothold in every large conti­
nent and established an empire second
only to that of Great Britain, France,
and Germany. Portugal was given
Roman Catholic jurisdiction over the
whole of the Orient, a trace of which is
seen today in Portuguese India and a
portion of British India. Large bodies
of the sober, hardy, industrious peasan­
try of the northern provinces seek their
fortune in Brazil and the colonies;

Portugal is again taking a ¿decided in­
terest in colonial expansion.
Cultural Activities:
Literature in Portugal is distinguished
by the wealth and variety of its lyric
poetry, its primacy in bucolic verse and
prose, and the number of its epic and
historical books. The cancioneiros
remain as evidence that the early love
songs of the whole Iberian Peninsula
were written in Portuguese ; and the
Atnadis, as expressed in primitive
prose, was the prototype of all romances
of chivalry. Present-day literature is
notable for a flowing rhythm and music,
for its attempt to interpret universal
**nature and human joys and sorrows, and
its revival of spiritual values. Monu­
mental historical works have been
achieved.
Picturesque costumes; dances obvi­
ously Moorish in origin with their
graceful arm gestures ; ancient ballads
or perhaps the plaintive folk-songs,
which every farm-hand knows and
sings, fitted to new words ; music of
xiide clarinet or bagpipe, but more fre­
quently by the mandolin-like Portuguese
1‘ guitar ’ ’ ; craftsmanship of exqui­
site porcelain, laces, embroideries; a
kindly, sober, nature-loving people in
close touch with invisible realms—all
these are impressions one gains from
the Portuguese peasantry.
This year (1936) notes the erection of
a monumental statue of the Marquis

History : Under the French Section,
Isis Lodge of Lisbon was chartered in
lggQ^with M. Joao Antunes, President,
and M ?XrR. Silva, Jr,, Secretary. The
Section was chartered 5 September 1921
with Dr. Joao Antunes as General Secre­
tary. In 1936 three of its original
Lodges, Visconde de Figaniere and
Annie Besant (1921), and the oldest
LodgeTTsis*,.-alk in Lisbon, were still
active. Portugal deeply appreciate the
visits of MrLJinarajadasa in 1927» 38,’'34 ;

Among devoted General Secretaries,
served Col. Oscar Garçao, whose pass­
ing is noted in 1935. Though blocked
by a war-torn territory, the Section sent
a youth and adult delegation to the
Geneva Congress, one party travelling
via Africa.
Propaganda ; Lectures in the Lodges
and in the Headquarters Lisbon home ;
besides a quarterly bulletin, leaflets of
propaganda, and 54 works of a Theo-
sophical nature edited by the Clássica
Editora Booksellers and published in
Portuguese. Great Days, celebrated
with special festivals of Brotherhood,
Solidarity, and Friendship, give em­
phasis to the fundamental ideals of
Theosophy.
Intensive work has been done through
a National League for the Protection of
Animals, with about 2,000 members,
supported by the efforts of Theosophists ;
The League has treated 3,600 animals a
year. A Fraternal League for assisting
the poor distributes thousands of dollars
in small sums annually ; a Children’s
Home cares for the destitute. The
weight of economic depression never
crushes in the Portuguese the spirit of
generosity, and our Theosophical breth­
ren express this spirit in fullest measure.

Blanton Winship, 5 February 1934 .
National Summary:
An independent, religious, enthusi­
astic people.
Puerto Rico has been given an increas­
ing measure of self-government since
the Island came from Spanish to Ameri­
can hands 18 October 1898. Civil
government was instituted in May 1900
under the Foraker Act ; the Olmsted Act
of 1909 placed the Island’s affairs under
the jurisdiction of an executive depart­
ment ; and the Jones Act of 1917 desig­
nated it a “ Territory of the United
States organized but unincorporated,”
granting all who chose citizenship in the
United States. Legislative functions
are vested in an insular Senate and
House, and Puerto Rico is represented
in the U.S.A. Congress through a
Resident Commissioner elected by the
people. The Tydings Bill passed by
the U.S.A. Congress June 1936 pro­
vides that the Islanders may vote on
their independence in a future plebiscite.
Cultural Activities :
Education was made compulsory in
1899, and in 1935 there were 4,670 class­
rooms in 2,121 school-buildings with
246,414 pupils enrolled ; together with a
well-distributed system of night-schools.
Private schools and the University of
Puerto* Rico complete the educational
facilities.

Puerto Rico Lodge of Aguadilla, Luis A.
Torregrosa, President, and Ramon Vaz­
quez, Secretary; and then a Lodge in
San* Juan and one in Utuado in 1911.
With thirteen Lodges a charter was
gained 28 January 1925, through the"
devoted efforts of Enrique Biascoechea,
Eugenio Astol and the first General
Secretary, Lodo Francisco Vincenty.

the Section in 1930.
Propaganda : The Section owns its
own Headquarters with a hall accom­
modating 150 persons. A weekly radio
talk at the favourable hour of 8.45—
9 p.m. from San Juan on Theosophy has
elicited many inquiries from interested
non-members. Excellent results were
gained through the Straight Theosophy
Campaign and the members are now
vigorously at work promoting “ There is
a Plan.”

National Summary :
Keynote: “ Art, Mysticism, Effici­
ency.” (G.S.A.)
Wave after wave of civilization has
swept over the land that is Rumania
from the earliest " Black Earth Culture, ’’
dated as the first half of the third mil­
lenium b .c., and marked by remarkable
painted pottery, highly artistic in design
and shape; through the Bronze Age
which gives record of a noble people
who drew from Transylvanian mines"
gold for ornaments and plate which
form the finest products of the
European Bronze Ag e; maintaining
that Bronze Age while surrounding
countries succumbed to the Iron Age ;
in the eighth century b ,c., finally
yielding to devastating invasions from
Scythia ; but recovering with the pene­
tration of the Romans who brought
130 T flE T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
to the original Celtic Daces their present
civilization and language, together with
a strong Latin impress of physique and
countenance. From the 6th century on­
wards, again came the conquerors—
Goths, Huns, Buigars, Slavs, Turks,
Greeks, each bringing their gift; with
brief respites in which the Daco-Romans
(early Rumanians) struggled to establish
the nucleus of a Nation, finally achieved
23 December 1861 by the union of the
two Principalities of Wallachia and
Moldavia, as Rumania.
The heroine Queen Marie, looking
back in vision* describes her country
during this nertt period as " peaceful,
nblooming, full of abundance, its vast
plaiiis an ocean of waving corn amongst
which diligent peasants move to and
fro gathering in the harvest.”
Rumania for a time stood aloof from
the World War, maintaining a strict
neutrality, for she had strong ties of
blood and sympathy on either side.
When it seemed as if the smaller Powers
would be overwhelmed, a catastrophe
she could not brook, with the hope also
of regaining her lost lands, she plunged
into the fray, her young soldiers saluting
their adored Queen with the valiant cry :
“ We are going! Going to victory, so
that you may become Empress, Empress
of all the Rumanians.”
The brilliant heroism of the fast
dwindling Rumanians achieved miracles,
but in the face of steadily advancing
armies one thing alone remained : with
their own hands they lit the funeral pyre
of their hopes and the nation’s treasure
—their rich oil-fields, lest they fall into
alien hands, and fled, leaving only
devastation behind.
From this unhappy picture we turn to
the Rumania of 1936. On every hand
new buildings, new boulevards, the busy
port Constanza (which celebrated its
40th anniversary July 1936), all give
evidence of prosperity, not this time
brought by foreign conquerors, but the
result of her own integration as a reunit­
ed people. As a young nation Rumania

Gordon.
has many problems to face, principally
that of strong racial minorities in those
regained territories. This she is attemp­
ting to solve by giving these minorities
the right to establish and manage their
own charitable, religious, social and
educational institutions in which they
may use their own language, and assur­
ing the minorities a fair share of public
funds therefor.
King Carol himself, an ardent demo­
crat, states: “ The Rumanian ‘people
want neither autocracy nor tyranny.
Certainly I shall never attempt to force
a dictatorship upon them, nor shall I
ever abolish Parliament and other free
institutions.”
Rumania has been an enthusiastic
supporter of the League of Nations, and
through her former Foreign Minister,
Titulescu (made a life member July
1936 of the Senate because of his service
through ten Legislatures) Rumania has
played an important part in world
affairs. Twice the rulers of the Little
Entente (Rumania, Czechoslovakia and
Yugoslavia) met for friendly converse in
1936 (June and October). The aim
of the present Government (George
Tatarescu, Prime Minister) is : To
follow a foreign policy aiming at ever
closer relations with the Little Entente,
the Balkan Entente, Poland, Great
Britain, and particularly France, with
friendly relations with Soviet Russia
and all Rumania’s other neighbours ; to
allow all political organizations freedom
of action, provided they are law-abid­
ing ; to disarm all armed party guards,
whether of the Right or of the Left; to
lay the foundation of a new discipline
in the universities; and to continue
the accelerated equipment of the Army.
Prompted by a growing tendency
among Rumanian youth to join ex­
tremist political movements, compul­
sory labour service to inculcate patriot­
ism was introduced in September,
1936. More than a million young people
are members of the Sentinels, into
which are merged Boy Scout and other
boys’ and girls’ organizations. Their
aim is to guard King and country, irre­
spective of party or creed, and their
training is both military and cultural.

Cultural A c tiv itie s :
Music, everywhere—improvised by

boisterous wind from turret bells or
rung by strong arms to herald a joy­
ful occasion. Beauty everywhere ! The

cient Roman veil, the glittering tiara, the
garments richly embroidered in gold,
silver, and many colours,” the decorated
houses ; the rich flora and fauna uniting
Asia and Europe. ‘ 4The soil has im­
pregnated the soul of the race with its
perfume, while the race has stamped
on nature the seal of originality ’ ’ which
*4clothes the landscape with a character
of hidden poetry, gentle dreaming and
tranquillity.” (A. Sturdza).
The peasant men have a look of calm
which with age gives them a look of
patriarchal beneficence. The aristocracy
and town-dwellers, greatly influenced by
French culture, are gay, witty, widely
read, extremely versatile, and express
themselves fluently in at least three
languages.

N ational Sum m ary :
Keynote : Human Solidarity and
Equality, Intensity of Purpose, Creative

Alone and unaided, in fact in the
beginning hindered on seventeen battle
fronts, the Bolshevik (Majority) Party
in 1917 established its Union of Socialist
Soviet Republics, and attempted the
magnificent experiment of building a
Socialist Commonwealth of Republics.
Through sheer integrity of purpose in
its internal work of national reconstruc­
tion and through demonstration of
peaceful and neighbourly intent in many
non-aggression pacts, the U.S.S.R,
won not only the formal recognition of
the Powers but the right of participa­
tion in world affairs in the League of
Nations. From the chaotic state after
the World War and widespread
T H E T H E O S O P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
132
'unorganized revolt of the long suppress­
ed masses, there came into beijig a Union
of Republics which could meet the two
essential requirements of Government:
(1) the maintenance of authority with
the consequent prevention of the dis­
integration of the realm ; (2) purposeful­
ness in the organization of ¿the com­
munity* as demonstrated through two
Five Year Plans which have reorganized
the economic and cultural life of the
nation.
E conom ic A chievem ents : In the
first Five Year Plan (1928-33, concluded
in 1932),* the heavy or basic industries
(iron, steel, etc.) were developed, in
order that industrial expansion might
be on a firm foundation. For example,
from a 29 million ton production of coal
in 1913, in 1930 the output was raised to
48 million tons, and in 1934 to 92 million
tons, while the aim for 1937 is 152
million tons. To make the country in­
dependent in the development of raw
materials and machinery was the first
project. Mighty power stations, includ­
ing the largest in the world, were
developed. 4
4 Electrification ” was the
slogan. Transport (new waterways, air
and railways) and communications linked
ocean to ocean, Agriculture was re­
organized at a speed unparalleled in
history. The acreage of arable land from
1927 to 1931 increased by 47 million
acres. Tractor and implement factories
supplied agriculture with the necessary
equipment. 2,820 State farms were or­
ganized, the largest of which covers
five million acres. Agricultural re­
search has kept pace, and the very
fine Institute for Botanical Research
has among its 230,000 useful plants
29,000 varieties of wheat alone. The
two-thousand acre botanical gardens
now being laid out on the Lenin Hills
near Moscow for the coming World
Fair to celebrate the establishment
of the new Constitution, will, show
by a special system of subsoil refrigera­
tion or heating tropical and arctic
plants growing close together in the
open air.
Though expansion continued in all
previous endeavours, the Special em­
phasis in the second Five Tear Plan
(1932-7, but in many lines to be
achieved in 1936) focussed upon building
up the lighter industrial superstructure
on the foundations well laid in the
first Plan. The food industries (can­
ning, refrigeration, etc.) received partic­
ular attention. The aim in the second
Plan was 1
4to make every citizen well-
to-do 4
4 (Stalin). The problem of over­
production does not enter the Soviet
regime for the 4
4 ultimate aim is not
profits, but production, and we are
continually increasing our production.
If we have a great quantity of goods,
our prices drop. The buyer then gets
the opportunity of making cheaper and
larger purchases. Our Soviet policy
is to reduce prices regularly and make
goods increasingly accessible to the
population ” (Nikoyan).
As a consequence of its great internal
development and peculiar economic
system, the Soviet Union was only
lightly touched by the world ecbnomic
crisis and ‘ 4such symptoms as over­
production, accumulation of stocks,
unemployment, increase in foreign in­
debtedness, bankruptcy, and wage cuts,
were conspicuous by their absence 4
4
(Litvinoff). The rouble has now been
stabilized to a gold standard. Income
in 1935 was 16% more than 1934 and
three and a half times that of 1929.
Another achievement of the present
regime is that an agriculture has now
been created which seems able to guard
against the large-scale famines so com­
mon in Russia before the Revolution.
These results have been accomplished
through wise planning, an urge for
efficiency in execution, and a glorious
spirit of sacrifice on the part of the
people, who regard the whole under­
taking as being, so to say, “ Our work
to further the development of a country
owned by Us.”
The Com ing E ra (N ew C onstitu­
tion ) : Communism is a form of social­
ism which asserts that to establish a
classless society: (1) A complete re­
volution in thought, feeling and action
on the part of the people is essential;
(2) To accomplish this revolution, there
must be an absolute dictatorship of a
party of idealists who see the vision
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 133
for at least a generation so that the
4
4slave mentality ” induced by the past
centuries of capitalism may be replaced
by the consciousness of applied human
solidarity, the aim of trfue socialism.
Therefore, Soviet Communistic Rus­
sia has undergone for a generation (over
eighteen years) a period of the strictest
party rule until city and country alike
could be educated to the socialistic ideal.
A new generation of boys and girls has
grown up. These young people look
forward to an unlimited future of
freedom, equality, and fraternity. The
new classless society has been establish­
ed, and consequently there is no need
for the old system of absolute party
dictatorship : gradual decentralization
of authority has been in progress for
several years, and now a new Constitu­
tion is in process of formation. This
unique document does not refer to a
need for struggle, class against class, as
in previous Constitutions, but on the
contrary asserts : 4‘ The e c o n o m i c
foundation of the U.S.S.R. consists in
the Socialist system of economy and
Socialist ownership of the implements
and means of production.” After care­
fully defining what is meant by the
property of the State, it gives new
leeway in allowing ” small private
economy of individual peasants and
handicraftsmen based on individual
labour and excluding the exploitation of
the labour of others.” The economic
life of the U.S.S.R. is determined by
plan ” for the purpose of increasing
public wealth, of a steady rise in the
material and cultural level of the
toilers, of strengthening the independ­
ence of the U.S.S.R. and its defence
capacity.” Work is still ” the obli­
gation of each citizen capable of
working.” The basic rights and obli­
gations of the citizens are defined as the
right to work and the right to rest, the
right to material security in sickness
and old age, complete equality between
men and women, both economic and
political, the right to education, and
complete equality irrespective of race or
nationality. Religious liberty, the
right to hold political demonstrations,
freedom of the Press, free speech, and
security from arbitrary arrest are aB
*
sured. A secret ballot, universal suffrage
(with many previous barriers removed),
and equality of representation between
peasant and industrial worker, together
with two Houses of Parliament, estab­
lish a regime which, though based on
a one-party Government is still as demo­
cratic as that to be found in trade and
fraternal organizations where party
politics are usually subordinate to the
effort to get the right man for the right
place.
Cultural A ctivities :
Perhaps the greatest single achieve­
ment of Soviet Russia is the raising of
the cultural standard of the masses. The
182 different nationalities were harmony
ized into one Soviet Union, but auton­
omy was introduced into as many areas
as possible that the indigenous cultures
and languages might be preserved. This,
together with the adoption of a common
Latin script, and the creation of 74
new alphabets also made possible the
rapid education of the peoples (adults
and children) throughout the Union.
There are 10,000 newspapers published
in 86 different languages with a total
circulation of 37 million copies.
Particular attention is given to back­
w ard areas. For example in Tadji­
kistan, a small country lying just north
of Afghanistan and the nearest territory
to India, in 192£„ib£re were only 6
modern schools"; in 1931 there were
over 2,000 educational institutions with
over 120,000 students. Beside ordinary
schools, there are being opened kinder­
gartens, training-schools, libraries, and
reading-rooms. Camel tracks were once
the highways ; now motor roads carry
industrialists from cotton plantations to
mills in Tadjikistan, and as everywhere
else in Russia, electrification modernizes
the country. Even in the far North a
city has been built and land is dis­
tributed, with the former nomads
organized into collective farms and
hunting co-operatives.
Great sympathy is also felt with
depressed classes, and the new
Constitution especially provides that an
asylum shall be granted in the U.S.S.R.
to all Left-Wing leaders persecuted by
134 T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L YEA R BOOK, 1937
their own home governments. A
second “ Jewish National Home ” is to
be found in the Jewish Soviet Republic
of Biro-Bidjan ; there Yiddish is the
official language and Hebrew cultural
aspirations find expression. Fifty per­
cent of the Budget is devoted to schools,
theatres, and artistic education, seven
million 'roubles in 1936 being spent on
new schools and libraries. A university
is coming into being with well equipped
mining, agricultural, economic, and
medical colleges.
Many hovel educational experiments
were adopted by the path-finders of the
Soviet Union, some of which have since
been discarded for bid and tried methods,
•but one admirable characteristic of the
Party is its willingness to admit failure
and adopt new or even discarded tactics.
The system of honorary degrees has
been reinstated, the universities have
been given greater autonomy, and fixed
textbooks again appear in the schools.
Disabilities attached to bourgeois origin
in higher educational institutions were
removed in December 1935.
C h ild ren : A distinctive feature of
Soviet education is its attempt to link
the school with life outside the school at
every possible point. The school
children discuss the design and technique
of new structures and become as in­
terested as the engineers themselves.
Moscow children run a toy factory—all
duties from director or foreman down to
ordinary workers being fulfilled by the
children, who work in shifts of one hour
and a half. No small part of the
attraction is that each young worker
receives one of the toys produced.
Children as the inheritors of the
future Soviet State are given the best of
everything, even though others lack.
Over two-thirds of all school children in
Soviet Russia are served with free hot
luncheons in the schools. The former
Czar’s Village, with its two imperial
palaces, near Leningrad, is now the
*’ Children’s Village.”
Women, too, have more freedom and
at the same time special protection from
the State. They enter all. professions
and large numbers are engineers. The
first woman ambassador in the world
was Mme Kollontai. A great ” Central
Institute for the Protection of Mother
and Child ” is in charge of crèches
and maternity hospitals throughout the
Union. The new (May, 1936) Family
Life Code provides large bonuses for
children. The population increase in
1935 exceeded four million, and the
population estimate for 1966 is three
hundred million, approximately double
what it is today. This is attributed to
the new feeling of economic security.
The Union feels no anxiety for the
future, as with only 37% of its territory
explored and prospected, its present
aggregate of mineral resources is greater
than that of any other nation.
H ealth. Dr. L. Haden Guest,
eminent English physician and F.T.S.,
writing for the Press from Moscow in
October, 1936, stated that ” the medical
organization of the Union is up to the
standard of any European country . . .
and shows distinct signs of reaching a
point which will make it one of the
leading countries of the world.” For*
example, the death rate has declined
from typhoid 61.3%, diphtheria 80.1%r
measles 50%, croup 60%. The children
of collective farmers weighed on an
average l j to 2 kilogrammes more in
1936 than in 1926. Vitamin concen­
trates (Vitamin C from the wild rose,
etc.) are fed in sweetmeats. Much
of the education in hygiene, because of
the linguistic difficulties, is done through
pictorial methods, movies, posters, etc.
Men and women from remote areas
receive training in Leningrad and return
to their villages as pioneer workers.
Sports are increasingly encouraged,
though *' record-breaking ’ ’ is frowned
on, as physical culture is considered a
means of preserving and improving
health, not an end in itself.
A dventure : In May, 1936, the two
aviators, Vodopyanov and, Mahkotkin,
flying in separate planes from Moscow
to Franz Josef Land, made the first
plane landing on this nearest known
land to the North Pole. All inter­
national records in parachute jumping
belong to the Soviet Union and at
least 800,000 people have jumped from
135
TH E TH EO SO PH ICAL YEAR BOOR, 1937
towers and 13,864 from aeroplanes
in 1935.
Science : Though necessity lays em­
phasis on applied science, theoretical
science is in no way neglected : Russian
scientists were second to split the atom ;
a plan is now being developed to make
a window into the universe through
layers of ozone so that ultra-violet light
can be more accurately studied ; many
useful stratosphere observations have
been made at record heights. One
very helpful invention of 1936 is a
photo-electric appliance that enables
the blind to read any book through a
keyboard-like surface of pegs.
In a huge hermetically-sealed cli­
mate globe,” Russian scientists study
not only the various climates in the
vast area of the Union, but also such
climates as exist in the habitable planets
and their effect upon living organisms.
Supersonic vibrations and light rays
accelerate the growth of plants so that
they may be grown in arctic regions.
Huge broadcasting stations furnish
programmes to the Soviet Union. A
development in films is the giant cinema
in the Moscow Park of Culture and
Rest, where 15,000 persons watch
moving pictures on a screen as tall
as a three-storey building. Russia
in 1933 led the Worid in number of
cinemas, 8,539 permanent and 14,258
travelling.
A rt: The people take great interest
in artistic and archaeological treasures
and the museums. Meyerhold’s experi­
ments in theatrical presentation and the
work of the Moscow Art Theatre and
Ballet are well known. At the new
Theatre for National, Minorities produc­
tions are given in the mother tongue.
Simplicity is the keynote of post-revolu­
tionary architecture. However, the new
Government has not allowed the ancient
buildings to fall into decay. Domed
palaces and*minarets have been painted
and re-gilded. Mansions have been
redecorated as originally designed.
Churches of artistic merit have been
repaired. Theatres are the pride of the
people. A characteristic of the new
architecture is flat roofs and balconies
for the recreation of the workers, with
enormous glass areas to give maximum
window djjace. In this land of be-
low-zero temperatures, this introduced
special construction problems, all of
which have been adequately met.
Exhibitions and art discussions in
Soviet factories arranged by the co­
operative organization of Soviet artists
give a wider understanding of artistic
endeavour to the toiling masses. Young
artists are encouraged by commissions
for portraits of prominent individuals,
works on art on specific themes, sculp­
ture, etc By the contract system, the
artist receives from 500 to 2,000 roubles
a fnonth with the obligation only of
repaying the money by creative work
during a stated period. No effort iflp
made to restrict the artist in his selection
of subjects. He is only relieved from
material strain during his period of
creativity.
Literature : The Soviet Russians have
turned the full force of their intensity
on the upbuilding of the Union, and
books dealing with industrial and econo­
mic development are read with far more-
enthusiasm than the average novel.
Such radical changes in the life of a
people produce revolutionary changes in
poetry and prose. Though much of the
literature, especially prose, is propa­
ganda, yet there is a freshness and
exuberant vitality, a ruggedness and
virility that mark the new spirit of the
people. An example is the song October
"W e went, asking for work and for
bread,
Our hearts were oppressed with
anguish,
The chimneys of the factories point­
ed toward the sky like tired hands
without strength to make a fist.
Louder than the common, the
silence was broken by the words
of our grief and our pain.
O Lenin ! the desire of calloused
hands !
# * *
October is a messengerfrom the sun !
October is the will of -the revolting
centuries !
October ! It is a labour, it is a joy
and a song . . . ”

Theosophy in Russia:
And in all this splendid development
of Russia The Theosophical Society at
the moment can aid only with its sym­
pathetic understanding, for the Russian
Section exists Outside Russia. During
this great revolutionary change, as many
of the workers were former aristocrats,
and ware suspected of anti-Soviet lean­
ings, though with deepest understanding
of the proletariat, the Russian Section
of The Theosophical Society ceased to
function in the home of its founder,
Helena^^trovna Blavatskyy herselfsuch
a Teveller of caste that she refused to
permit the use pf her rightful titles and
preferred to be called simply “

"known merchant, was, as secretary, the
link with Headquarters. A Warsaw
centre is mentioned as existing from
1893 to 1895. But these isolated centres
attracted little attention. In the great
cities ‘ ' Theosophical teachings were
banned by the censor, though a Russian
Grand Duke used to have smuggled m a
copy of Lucifer, edited by his country­
woman. YeTcoulH not the Divine Wisdom

youths and maidens would steal across
the frontier, bent on gaming knowledge,
and as the gates were closed in their eager
faces in Russia, they e’en sought to
quench their thirst abroad. So many
a foreign university, in Switzerland,
Sweden, and elsewhere, welcomed (in
the eighties) these children of an unkind
mother, and they gathered ideas of
liberty as well as the lessons of science,
and went home enriched with knowl­
edge and with ideals of freedom, to
free their own people alike from ignor­
ance and from tyranny. Among these
was Anna Rabbinovitch, who had gained
some Theosophical knowledge during
her exile, and thought that she could
give to her people no more precious gift
than this. Sp she and a few others set
up a secret press, and printed Theo­
sophical pamphlets and these were passed
from hand to hand. After a while the
seed began to grow, despite the White

ing, Anna Kamensky dreamed of a
Theosophical Society in Russia, and she
and a tiny band of devoted women were
sent back as sheep in the midst of wolves.
Presently came a respite of tyranny, and
a little Lodge was formed, and then tiny
groups here and there, till the T.S. in
Russia became an accomplished fact (12
Nov 1908), and what had been whis­
pered from ear to ear was spoken aloud
for all to hear who would. The T.S.
in Russia sent its reports year by year,
and the fine genius of Russia spoke
through a Pogovsky, an Ootomsky, a
Poushlnne, and the hearts of the
pioneers were glad.” —Annie Besant.
The Section continued intensive work

of construction.
Cultural Activities:
Two streams of cultural life mingle in
the literature and Art of Scotland : The
deep and serious life of Calvinism, the
dominant religion of the land ; and the
lyric heritage of Gaelic ancestry with its
close contact with nature and invisible
realms. To know Scotland, one must
read the novels of Sir Walter Scott, the
poems of Robert Burns, the biographies
of its great pioneers, statesmen and
heroes.
A characteristic architecture is reveal­
ed in the Scottish National War
Memorial and certain of its old castles.
The modernistic movement in Europe
was introduced forty years ago by a Scot­
tish architect, Charles Rennie Mackin­
tosh, but it made little impression in his
own land. Scotland’s music has recently
been enriched by a bagpipe song written
by His Majesty the King, the revival of
the clarsach or small Celtic harp, and
the research of Marjorie Kennedy-
Fraser which brought to light the
poignant Hebridean folk songs. The
Grand Lodge celebrated its bicentenary
in November, 1936, at which the Kiqy
was made a Grand Master Mason.

private Lodge in 1891. The next
Lodge was the Glasgow T.S., 1888,
with E. Macbean as Secretary, rechar­
tered in 1900. The oldest living Lodge
was chartered in Edinburgh 1893,
G L. Simpson, President, C. M. Oliver,
Secretary. All these Lodges were
functioning when a Section charter was
granted 3 March 1910, under the able
leadership of Major David Graham Pole
who served until 1920. All the great
leaders have lectured in Scotland many
times. Its Silver Jubilee was celebrated
in 1935.
Propaganda: A fine Headquarters
sends out a steady stream of literature.
Various Youth organizations are active.
To further the Straight Theosophy
Campaign, thousands of pamphlets were
distributed among the general public,
resulting in 4

the general thought atmosphere of
Scotland, and a surer grounding in
the great truths of Theosophy. ’ ’

^National Summary:
A virile, independent cDominion,
deeply loyal to the Crown.
One of the most important events of
recent years, and visioned many years
before by Cecil Rhodes, was the fusion,
„2 December 1934, of the two largest
political interests, the South African
Party, under the leadership of Gen.
Smuts, and the National Party under
Gen. Hertzog, representing Boer in­
terests, in a United Party of South
Africa, with the following aims :
1. The recognition of the distinctive
cultural heritage of each section of the
people, aiming at the realization of*the
national aspirations and conviction qf
*sthe people with the motto, “ South
Africa first.”
2. Maintenance of the existing re­
lationship between the Union and the
British Commonwealth.
3. Co-operation with the other mem­
bers of the British Commonwealth.
4. An earnest endeavour to reach a
satisfactory solution of the native ques­
tion along lines which, without depriv­
ing the native of his right of develop­
ment, will recognize as paramount the
essentials of European civilization.
5. Protection of all sections of the
population against Asiatic immigration
or competition.
An Amended Natives Representation
Bill was introduced 27 Feb. 1936, de­
signed to unify the status of the native
throughout the Union, providing for
the abolition of the native franchise
in Cape Province and the creation of a
Native Representative Council, elected
from four great divisions in the Union,
the present voters to be registered on a
special roll that will entitle them to
elect three European members to the
House of Assembly and two to the Cape
Provincial Council. General Smuts,
who has defended native interests for
many years feels that though the Bill is
not ideal, it contains the elements of
justice and fair play, and believes that
the natives will realize that Government
has gone a very long way towards giving
them a square deal.
A surplus of over £ l.OOp.OOO is to be
paid into various funds for pensioners
both white and coloured, and help for
the farmers.
The Silver Jubilee of the Union was
celebrated 31 May 1935.
Cultural Activities :
The Empire Exhibition of South
Africa was opened at Johannesburg on
15 September 19:
36, illustrating the pro­
gress of South Africa and the British
Empire during the last fifty years and
commemorating the Golden Jubilee of the
City of Johannesburg, which has grown
in that period from a population of 50
to over 500,000. The aeroplane in which
Mrs. Mollison established the record to
Cape Town hangs in a central rotunda ;
a Palace of Arts shows artistic achieve­
ments of the Empire with special atten­
tion to native African life. A unique
architecture is that of the old Dutch
farmhouses, developed for more modern
conditions by the genius of Herbert
Baker, architect of many fine buildings.
A distinctively South African literature
has developed in both English and
Afrikaans, which are the official langua­
ges. The education of native races
is largely in the hands of missionaries
subsidized by Government (over 25% of
the Budget spent on education). There
are five universities in the Union.
Gen. Smuts visions a great National
Park from Kenya to the present Kruger
National Park, 200 by 40 miles, a
sanctuary for bird and beast.

African Section, with headquarters at
Durban, was chartered 27 April 1909.
Because of the vast distances between
the scattered chain of Lodges, a Central

but this experiment came to an end in
the amalgamation of 1936.

SPAIN
President of the Republic : Don
Manual Azaiia Diaz, 11 May 1936-.
^National Summary:
Keynote : 44The Spirit of Culture, In­
dependence and Adventure.' ’ (G.S.A.)
For many years Spain has been torn
with internal dissensions, and it was
hoped that the new Republic proclaimed
in Spain on 14 April 1931 with its re­
form Constitution would resolve the
discordant elements into a harmonious
and integrated nation. However, the
political struggles continued, Cabinet
after Cabinet being formed in rapid
succession in an endeavour to attain
national stability. These Governmen­
tal changes were punctuated with riots
and strikes, some attaining the dignity
of minor insurrections, and for many
months the country was declared by
Government to be in a 44state of alarm ’ ’
with consequent limitations of the privi­
leges usually enjoyed by the people.
Again it was hoped, when the new
President, Don Manual Azaiia, took
over the reins of Government in May,
1936, and initiated a comprehensive
programme of agrarian and general
social relief that a new era was in view
for Spain. However, on 18th July a
revolt broke out in many military garri­
sons of Spanish Morocco which spread
rapidly throughout Spain, and on 20th
November the insurgents had occupied
a large portion of the country, were
heavily shelling Madrid, and had set up
an opposition “ Nationalist Govern­
ment ’ ’ with General Francesco Franco
as dictator, A statement of his policy
on 1st October 1936 declared : 44An
authoritarian State, no Parliament, but
the will of the people to be made known
through corporative assemblies ; friend­
ship with all nations, except Sovietized
States ; the new State to give social
justice to all, with a hearth and bread
guaranteed to all workers ; the country
to be reorganized as a hierarchical
regime, typically Spanish.” Those
elements fighting with Franco for
4
4Nationalism ” are Royalist and Cle&r
cal, as the privileges previously enjoyed
by both have been seriously curtailed
under the new Constitution (dissolution
of the Jesuit Order, etc.). Strongly
supporting the 4
4Nationalist Movement ”
also are the land owners, large and small,
of Northern Spain, who resent Govern­
ment’s agrarian policy of reappor­
tionment to the wofully poor peasantry.
As Right and Left elements are closely
balanced, there is still hope that a
blending of idealism may result in a
new Spain in which all elements may
find expression and fulfilment.
Cultural Activities :
Political upheavals and civil war have
played havoc in the immediate past
months with the expression of a
Nation, essentially cultural, a Nation
which finds its normal outlet in liter­
ature, soiig, dance and the other arts.
With a return to normality will un­
doubtedly come a renaissance of cultural
life.
Among the eminent men of Spain
may be noted Rey Pastor, Professor
of Mathematics in Madrid University,
whose Foundations of Superior Pro­
jective Geometry comprise the sum total
of knowledge of Geometry of Spaces of
n dimensions; Gregorio Marafion, physi­
cian noted for endocrine glandular re­
search ; Juan de La Cierva, inventor of
the autogiro ; Manuel de Falla, a com­
poser of some of the most genuinely
representative modern Spanish music;

Theosophy in Spain :
General Secretary : Luis Garcia Lor-
enzana, 1931-.
History : The Theosophical Society
owes its development in Spain to the
devoted efforts of two enlightened Span­
iards : Don José Xifré, a man of wealth,
and Don Francisco Montoliu, agricul­
tural engineer. Don Xifré met H.P.B.
in London and joined The Society in
1889, staying with H.P B. until her
death two years later, during which
time he was one of her most devoted
pupils. In the same year 1889, Señor
Montoliu became a member and started
at once on the translation of Isis Un­
veiled. Through H P.B. these two men
joined forces in spreading Theosophical
teachings in Spain and Spanish America
through their translations of almost the
entire Theosophical literature.
In 1890 Don José Roviralta of Bar­
celona, a very scholarly man, joined
The Society; m 1891, another member
joined in Barcelona, as well as five more
in Madrid. These nine members con­
stituted the Spanish group of The Theo­
sophical Society for which Señor Monto­
liu had been working since 1889. Nine
more members joined in 1892, among
them Señor Trevifío, who is now the
oldest F.T.S. in Spain. The Barcelona
Centre was started in 1891, and in May
1893 both the Madrid and Barcelona
lodges were formed.
In 1895 eighteen members in «all had
Joined '¡nié Society. In that year Col.
jDlcott visited Madrid and the work was
stiirjurther síimüTated! '
The magazine Sophia was a valuable
instrument of propaganda from 1890
to 1914, having been preceded by two
short-lived magazines, Estudios Teoso-
fíeos and Antakarana. This maga­
zine was revived in 1926 by Señor
Garrido and published for five years.
Another magazine was issued in Barce­
lona, El Loto Blanco, which still carries
on under the title Theosophia. An
extensive Bulletin, was also published
during Señor Garrido’s administration
and revived in 1928 by Miss Nicolau
with the idea of preparing for a future
Spanish edition of The Theosophist,
a project approved by Dr. gesant.
Some outstanding Sates in fection
history are : 1908, the formation (thanks
to the munificence of Señor Xifré) of
a Theosophical Publishing House call­
ed The Orientalists Library, under
the able conduct of Señor Maynade ;
a campaign for popularizing Theosophy
in Barcelona through public lectures,
a library, etc. ; 1913, the Spanish
Group which had previously belonged
first to the European Section of The
Theosophical Society and later to the
British Section, was attached to Adyar
with Señor Xifré as Presidential Agent ;
1920, the passing of Señor Xifré and
the appointment as Presidential Agent
of Señor Garrido, who had long been
carrying the brunt of the active work
in Spain ; 28 April 1921, the formation
of the Spanish Section with Señor
Garrido as first General Secretary ;
1926, an attempt at Theosophical com­
munity life was made on the Alcait
Estate, to which Señor Giner bequeathed
a library; 1927, at Dr. Besant’s request
M. Charles Blech of France restored
peace in the Spanish Section and was
made Honorary Member ; jn September
Mr. Jinarajadasa presided at a General
Assembly at which new rules and
regulations were adopted emphasizing
the democratic spirit of The Society ;
1928, Miss Esther Nicolau (now Mrs.
Torra) cemented the peace of the
Section which has carried on happily
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 141
ever since; 1920 and 1934, Mr. Jina-
rajadasa’s second and third visits and
lectures in Spanish ; 1930-32 the lecture
tours of the great scientist Dr. Rosa
de Luna; 1934 the European Federa­
tion met in Barcelona,
Propaganda : The present General
Secretary, Señor Lorenzana, has for
many years been active in the propaganda
field, as early as 1931 having twenty
officers working for the distribution of
leaflets and pamphlets. In spite of the
political, geographical and ethnographi­
cal difficulties, Theosophical ideas are
steadily and surely permeating the
thought of the cultured classes in Spain
and Spanish Morocco, and even the
Balearic Islands has its Lodge (Palma
de Mallorca).
Artistic festivals of Spanish music
and dancing play a prominent part in
Theosophical activities; in Valencia
Lodge, for example, there is a group
of “ Practical Idealists ” with an
orchestrá of eighteen musicians. All
great days are observed. The Diamond
Jubilee Support Convention held in
July 1935 in Madrid was a great event
in the life of the Section. Conventions
are held every two years, alternating
between Madrid and Barcelona.
Beside the official Bulletin, several
of the Lodges publish monthly subsid­
iary bulletins. Recent Theosophical
publications are : El Egipto Misterioso
by Dr. Eduardo Alfonsb, and a series
of books on Masonry by “ Magister.”
The Presidential Campaigns from
Adyar have been enthusiastically backed
by the Spanish Section, and the Gener­
al Secretary attended the Diamond Jubi-
lee Convention at Adyar. Many unique
propaganda methods are in progress.
The Theosophical Atheneum of Madrid?
founded by Dr. Rosa de Luna brings
into the Movement sympathizers, of
whom many later become members.
The commodious Section headquarters
is centrally located in Madrid, with a
hall large enough to seat 400 people.
The Theosophical Movement is very
much alive in Spain.
SWEDEN
Reigning King: Gustaf V, b. 16
June 1858. Succeeded to Throne, 8
December 1907, Crown Prince Gustaf
Adolf, b. 11 Nevember 1882.
National Summary:
Keynote : *‘ Culture, Rectitude, Effi­
ciency.” (G.S.A.)
A country so stable that the crash of
financial interests within and a world
depression without made only the
slightest impression on its equilibrium.
The unemployed were absorbed into a
great programme (previously set in
motion during the World War) of pro­
ductive public works, such as airports,
canals, bridges, swamp drainage, refore­
station, harbour construction, roads, and
a co-operatiye housing plan. Direct
relief, save for the disabled, is practi­
cally unknown.
Swedish democracy is vital, vigorous
and constructive and the Nation is
really a crowned republic, Many of
the Princes have married commoners,
and from May 1936 a Prince who so
10
marries with the consent of the King and
Cabinet, will not forfeit his right to the
Crown. The co-operative spirit is strong
in Sweden, not only in economic fields,
but also in politics: the two largest
elements, Social-Democratic and Agra­
rian Parties united in September, 1936,
in a Coalition Cabinet, Hr. Per Albin
Hansson, Prime Minister.
The whole of Scandinavia is united
by this bond of democracy and good
fellowship. Scandinavians settle their
difficulties without rifle shots or rude
words. When, after 90 years of union
with Sweden, Norway proclaimed her
independence, Sweden accepted her
decision with the utmost friendliness.
Because of Sweden’s strict neutrality
in the World War, to her was entrusted
the inspection of prison camps of war­
ring nations; and after the war she
assisted large numbers of children from
impoverished nations back to health in
Sweden. A Swedish relief expedition
helped Russia; a Swedish ambulance
|42 frTJfE THEOSOPHICAL YEAK BOOK, 1937
corps helped the Abyssinians. Control
of armaments is now in governmental
hands. The death penalty is abolished.
Cultural A c tiv itie s :
Some great events in 1935-6 : The mar­
riage of Princess Jmgrid, only daughter
Of the Crown WHace, to the Crown
Prince of Denmark, 24 May 1935 ; the
Riksdagss 500th anniversary, at which
was unveiled the statue of Engelbrekt,
its founder, done by the sculptor Carl
Eldh.
Sweden’s modernistic architecture,
its straight lines, its bright colours, its
simplicity, seem to reflect the mental
outlook of the people. *
The descriptive realism of the niife-
iies, as shown by the genius of Johan
August Strindberg, has given place
to a more subtle realism with an ideal­
istic trend, the particular glory of
the last wave of Swedish literature
being its lyric poetry. The tendency
of the modern novel is toward an
intimate study of human life, and in
this field appear many great names,
among them Hjalmar Bergman, Judwig
Nordstrom, K. H. Ossiannilsson, Sigfrid
Siwertz, Erik Fahlman ; and the very
original woman writers, Selma Lagerlof
(one of Sweden’s oldest living novelists),
Elin Wagner, and Hildur Dixelius-
Brettner.
Recent scientific achievements in­
clude : The measuring of the whole
period from the ice age to the present day
by Ragnar Liden ; the vitamin, hor­
mone, and enzyme work of Prof von
Euler : the revolutionary discoveries in
biology of Prof. Svedberg ; the work of
Prof. John Reenstierna of the University
of Upsala for the cure of leprosy which
may eventually make true the inscrip­
tion above one leper hospital: 1*Do
not abandon hope Ye who enter
here.”
The Church (Lutheran Protestant) is
liberal, with a keen appreciation of the
beautiful, many freethinkers amongst
the clergy having a world vision. There
has been a revival of religious life among
the youth of Sweden.
The Nobel Prizes, created by Alfred
Nobel, and awarded for the first time in
1901, give a real insight into the idealism
of the Swedish Nation : Five prizes are
awarded yearly to those who have *' con­
ferred the greatest benefit on mankind ’ ’
in the realm of physics, chemistry,
physiology or medicine, to the person
who has produced the most distinctive
work of an idealistic tendency in
literature, and to the one who has
done most to promote the fraternity
of nations, disarmament, or the propaga­
tion of Peace.
Theosophy in S w ed en :
General Secretary : Mrs. Elma Berg,
J g & r-s , ..
Count Axel Wachtmeister in 1891 tells
the early story ; “ The Swedish Theo-
sophical Society was inaugurated on 10
Februaryl889 in Stockholm . . . There
has alwaJ’SHWen^-V' Tendency towards
metaphysical speculation in the mind of
the Scandinavians, so that the quick
development of Theosophy in Sweden was
not to be wondered at. The way had
been paved by the able lectures of Dr.
von Bergen, but the real impetus towards
forming a Theosophical Society in
Sweden was given in the first place by
the Countess Wachtmeister, who was
the first to introduce Theosophic litera­
ture into that country, and in the second
place by a body of earnest and able men
and women in the capital of Sweden, led
by Dr. Gustaf Zander, the actual Presi­
dent.” The Count then mentions the
President-Founder’s visit and his inter­
view with His Majesty Oscar II, who
had ‘4a cultured interest in symbolism
and kindred subjects . . . This visit
laid a solid foundation to the ever-in-
creasing building of Theosophic thought
in Sweden.” The Movement in the
whole of Scandinavia was localized in
Sweden, until one by one the local Soci­
eties grew strong enough to set up their
own Sections, Finland in 1907, Norway
in 1913, Denmark and Iceland in 1918.
The oldest living Swedish Lodges are :
Örebro (1893), Solleftea (1895), Sunds-
vall (1898), Stockholm (1899). Many of
the great leaders have given lecture tours
in Sweden and have spoken enthusiasti­
cally of the Section's activities. Mr.

SWITZERLAND
President of the Confederation
for 1936 ; Dr. Albert Meyer (Zurich).
Vice-President of the Pederal
C ouncil for 1936—Dr. Giuseppa
Motta (Tessin).
National Summary:
Keynote : " Freedom, Probity, Near­
ness to Nature." (G.S.A.) The Swiss
Confederation is made up of 22 small
but sovereign Statesdiffering from each
other as to religion, political structure,
industry, social customs, and language,
yet forming a unified and deeply patriotic
nation. Switzerland is regarded as a
model for a United States of Europe.
The people are the final authority both
as to the affairs of their individual
State and the Confederation as a whole,
and a referendum is often taken on
Federal legislation. Unity in diversity is
indicated by the motto " Each for all
and all for each."
Because of its peculiar geographical
and spiritual position, and perpetual
neutrality. Switzerland has been chosen
to promote humanitarian international
work. In Switzerland was born the
Red Cross. In 1936 the League of
Nations and nearly a hundred other
international institutions were centred
in Geneva. Because of her loyalty,
honour, and conservative good judg­
ment, Switzerland has won a special
place amongst the Nations, and on many
occasions an appeal has been made to
this small nation to act as arbitrator in
some delicate international matter.
Cultural Activities
In a country whose greatest distance
from frontier to frontier is 200 miles,
there are seven universities. In Europe,
Switzerland ranks first for university
full-time attendance (1 to every 387
persons), and holds second place for the
whole world.
The Swiss are skilled craftsmen and
their inventive genius has developed a
process for photographing directly on
cloth; a clock that never stops; an
automatic train, safety fuse, etc.
In spite of the attraction and use of
the languages of its three great neigh­
bours, Germany, France, and Italy,
there has developed a characteristically
Swiss note, and the work of Rousseau,
Mme de Staël, Benjamin Constant,
and Jung indicate the important contri­
bution of Switzerland to world culture.
The works of Prof. George Méautis,
one time General Secretary of the Swiss
Sedtion of The Theosophical Society,
throw great light on ancient civiliza­
tions. " Swiss writers are given t3
thought and self-examination ; they are
seekers after truth, less ready to com­
plain of destiny than to acknowledge
their own shortcomings, plain citizens
who are at the same time dreamers."
(Enc, Brit. 14th Ed.)
From the world over people visit the
Alps of Switzerland for restoration to
health and recreation. The Swiss are
famed for their skill in the winter sports,
skating, ski-ing, etc.
Theosophy in Switzerland:
General Secretary : M. Georges R.
Tripet, 1935-.
History : The Locarno Centre was
formed in 1891 by Dr. Pioda, the Berne
Centre in ^ T | | r^ H O farl Brun S t ^
and "the Zurich C&utceu aisb"llf§37Dy
J. SpQnheimer. " The German-speaking
Lodges were attached to the German
Section, and the French-speaking to the
French Section. The oldest recorded
Lodge was Philalethes, 12 January
1903. The Section was organized, Mile
H. Stephani as General Secretary,
1 December 1910, the German-speaking
Lodges still attached to the German
Section. In 1924 a few independent
Lodges were organized into a Swiss
Federation with Eric de Henseler as
President, which in 1926 amalgamated
with the Section. The founding of the
International Theosophical Centre at
Geneva 1 November 1928 has played a
very important part in spreading Theos­
ophy in Switzerland, and both the
Section and the Centre are housed in
144 T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
a mutually-shared Headquarters, central­
ly situated near converging» streets in
Geneva. All the leading Theosophical
lecturers, both International and Euro­
pean, have visited Switzerland many
times. The greatest event in the history
of the Section the Fourth World
Congress of The Theosophical Society,
held at Geneva 29 July—5 August 1936.
Propaganda : The activities of mem­
bers take many forms : literature and
lectures in both French and German ;
social service and work for peace ; the
projection of a film on reincarnation at
a large cinema in Geneva, with a talk
given by the General Secretary ; and
noteworthy work done to further the
Straight Theosophy Campaign.
URUGUAY
President of Republic : Señor Dr.
Gabriel Terra, elected 1 March 1931 ;
te-elected 19 April 1934, to serve 19
May 1934-8.
National Summary :
A progressive and internationally-
minded nation, Uruguay has taken an
active interest in the League of Nations,
in August 1936 proposing *4that limited
or regional agreements might be includ­
ed within the framework of the Con-
venant . . . without prejudice to the
universal character of the League, whose
governing organs will always have the
last word in case of serious confer­
ences.” In 1921 suffrage was granted
to women, and in 1934 Uruguay advoca­
ted at the 7th Pan-American Confer­
ence a removal of all discriminations
based on sex in matters of nationality.
Capital punishment was abolished in
1907. To include adequate representa­
tion of the two leading political elements
in Uruguayan politics, conservative and
progressive, under the new Constitution
(19 April 1934), both the Council of
Ministers and the Senate divide their
seats between the two political parties
obtaining the highest number of votes,
providing that these two poll an absolute
majority in presidential elections.
Cultural Activities :
Primary education is obligatory and
both primary and superior education is
free. In addition to the University at
Montevideo, a school of arts and crafts,
five normal schools, and 62 adult courses,
all State supported, there are many relig­
ious seminaries and schools for the
handicapped. State and Church are
separate, and there is complete religious
liberty. The 1908 census showed 430,095
Catholics, 126,425 Liberals, 45,470 Pro­
testants, and 45,470 unspecified.
Theosophy in Uruguay :
General Secretary: Rafael Fuller,
1935-.
History : The first Lodge in Uru­
guay was in jVTrmtfivi^lfin 22^Jnneul90A^
T. Enrique Viera, President, and
Ricardo Moratorio, General Secretary.
In 1905 is noted the Hiranya T.S.
Combining Paraguay and Argentina, the
Argentina Section was formed 18
January 1905, and January 1925 the
Uruguayan Section was chartered under
Señora Annie M. Gowland as General
Secretary. The work of the Section was
laid out along seven lines : education,
social affairs, art and sciences, religion
and philosophy, philanthropy, adminis­
tration, and finance.
The General Secretary of Uruguay,
Sra. Julia A. de la Gamma, was chosen
as the first General Secretary of the
South American Theosophical Federa­
tion in 1930.
Propaganda : Through a r t i s t i c
pamphlets, such as a translation of
Tagore’s poem 4
4Chitra,” by the Art
Group Vidya, through the interest of
such public officials as the Minister of
Education, who introduced Mr. Jinara-
jadasa to the public in 1929 ; through
the co operation of the press ; through
organizing an outer movement to study
the problems of youth, and many other
original methods of propaganda, the
Section presents Theosophy to Uruguay,

Ancient Druidic stronghold, in whose
soil the sacred oaks were long intertwined,
whose Isle of Anglesey (to which tradi­
tion still gives sanctity) may well have
been that mystic Ierna, shrine of the
perpetual fire, which Strabo places 4
4on
an Island near Britannia ’ ’ ; whose

ity of the Soul.” Stronghold of the
Christian faith in the early Christian
era, whose patron Saint, David, united
in one Christian body the British Isles.
Still a centre of Friendliness and Unity,
whose children since 1921 have on 18th
May broadcast a Message of Goodwill
to other children the world over, and
have in turn received replies from over
seventy countries. A strong desire to
express the National soul has led to a cul­
tural revival of the Welsh language and
traditions. The founding of the Univer­
sity of Wales in 1878-1905 marked an
immediate widening of horizons, and
this present century has built up a con-
* Pomponius quoted in Isis Unveiled, i, 18,

in technique and beauty.
Theosophy in Wales:
General Secretary : Peter Freeman,
since formation of Section 28 June 1922.
History : Cardiff and Llandudno were
established as centres jn 1,893r but the
first Lodge is noted in Cardiff* under
the Rev. J. Tyssul Davis in 1911. 10
Park Place, Cardiff was purchased as
Headquarters on 18 March 1918, the free­
hold being acquired three years later.
By. the time the Section was chartered
fourteen Lodges had been organized in
union with the English Section. Tl^
Welsh Theosophical Trust Ltd., was
formed 28 October 1925. The Headquar­
ters was dedicated 44to the Service of the
Masters and to Humanity ’ ’ on Adyar
Day, 17 February 1927. The Annie
Besant Memorial Hall at 10 Park
Place, Cardiff, was opened by the Lord
Mayor of Cardiff and dedicated by Dr.
Arundale on 8 October 1934. Conven­
tions are held annually and have been
presided over by Dr. Annie Besant
(four times) ; Bishop Leadbeater, C.
Jinarajadasa, Dr. Arundale (1934).
Propaganda : A Theosophical Inquiry

4Art, Emotion, Freedom.”
(G.S.A.)
The South Slavs (Serbs, Croats and
Slovenes) 1 December 1918 united as a
Triune Kingdom, on 3 October 1929,
taking the name of Yugoslavia. The
new State is the fulfilment of old
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937
strivings for an independent status,
dating definitely back to the 8fh century.
The welding of these peoples of diverse
tongues and faiths into a definite na­
tional consciousness was the goal of the
late King, and his nation bestowed on
him the title of “ the Heroic Unifier.”
His last words w6re "Guard Yugo­
slavia ! V
The present Government, Dr. Milan
Stoyadinovitch, Prime Minister, re­
mains true to the principle of Unity
voiced in the 1931 Constitution, and is
attempting to ‘*adapt our laws . . . to
the aspirations and desires of the people,
which means wide popular autonomy,
electoral freedom, freedom of the Press,
and the right of forming associations.
The Government desires to enable real
participation by the masses in the
direction of affairs of State.” A general
amnesty for political prisoners confirmed
the policy of the Government.
The whole nation is concentrating its
devotion on King Peter, a very intel­
ligent boy, whose title is " The Hope of
Yugoslavia.”
Friendly relationships have been
established with Yugoslavia’s seven
neighbours both through the Little En­
tente and other pacts. A Hungarian and
Yugoslavian rapprochement led to the
statement, March 1936, that both nations
"a re anxious to see the political and
mental barriers between the two countries
disappear and are ready to co-operate
wholeheartedly for the creation of a
better Europe.” Yugoslavia is a firm
S
rter of the League.
Lral Activities:
Three great religious elements meet
in Yugoslavia: The Serbian-Orthodox
Church with 49%, the Roman Catholics
with 37J%, and the Moslems with 11%
of the nations as adherents. All religions
have representation. Such spiritually
minded men as Bishop Strossmayer have
realized that Yugoslavia has an impor­
tant mission in bringing about a closer
understanding between Eastern and
Western faiths.
The aesthetic and heroic spirit, high
morals and fine sentiment of the South
Slavs were embodied in their national
poetry sung through the middle ages by
their famous blind bards. The cathe­
drals, monasteries and castles of
Dalmatia bespeak their art. Dubrovnik
was a centre of civilization from the
fifteenth century. Greek, Roman,
Byzantine and Teutonic cultures have
here merged.
" Three names of creative power
stand forth in the world today: Nikola
Tesla, a master of electricity who
transforms these waves into symphonies
of light; Ivan Mestravic, a master of
beauty, who in his architectural struc­
tures transforms life into symphonies
of Victory ; and €Jakob Gotovac, a
master of sound, who transforms the
soul vibrations of the South Slav
Nations into the ' National Symphony
of Yugoslavia. ’ ’’ (Jelisava V£vra.)
T heosophy in Y u gosla via :
General Secretary: Jelisava VAvra,
1925-.
History : Theosophy came to Yugo­
slavia in 1921^John Cordes assisting.
In 1923* seven Yugoslavian members
attended the Vienna Congress, and on
their return founded Lodges in Zagreb
with the aim of '*permeating our
Nation with Theosophical ideals in
order that it may fully utilize the
spiritual opportunities which are before
it.” As a result of the inspiring
visit of Dr, Armadale.. and Shrimati
Rukmini Devjfju__1925_the Section
was founded T charter dated 14 Septem­
ber 1925, the inauguration being per­
formed by Augustus Knudsen, with the
present General Secretary, assisted
by Valerija MayerhofFer, heading the
Section. Many lecturers from other
countries have visited the Section, the
great visit of 1936 being that of the
President and Shrimati Rukmini Devi.
Propaganda : The spirit of reverence
for greatness is deep in the member^
and every great Day in national and
Theosophical history, as well as birth­
days of leaders, is noted by the Lodges
in celebrations of from one day to a
week. The Society often responds tP
requests to assist in civic activities, such
as acting as host on the Great Silence
Day, etc. Books have been translated
and published, together with Teozofija,
the Section journal; a rapidly growing

library lends many Theosophical books ;
the Children and Youth Movement is
strong ; exhibitions of paintings and
craftsmenship showing ancient symbol­
ism are held. The Section motto is
“ Brotherhood in daily life /’ and from
its Headquarters emanates a steady flow
of devotion and love.
THE FAB, EAST
(China, Japan and Adjacent Territories)
President of the National Govern­
ment of China: Mr. Lin Shen (Feb.,
1932, re-elected December, 1935).
Reigning Sovereign of Japan:
Emperor Hirohito, 25 Dec. 1926.
Keynote of Par East:
A cultural consciousness and self-con­
trol born of a civilization, predating by
millenia the occidental eras. Reverence,
devotion, humility and obedience are
deeply ingrained qualities: in Japan
poured out to Emperor and State ; in
China turned to Family, present and past.
In both countries the people are industri­
ous, frugal, provident, skilful, polite, and
there is an emphasis on conduct. China
and Japan could well be compared with
the Brahmana and Kshattriya castes of
India, for the Chinese hate war and do
not consider superiority in military power
an attribute of a higher civilization, but
rather that a resort to force is proof of
a lower order of life. In China the
emphasis has been laid on scholarship,
and in no other country in the world
have intelligence and education been so
exclusively the means of obtaining public
distinction, and office.
The ideal of the Samurai of uncom­
promising manliness, self-control and
loyalty to death has dominated the Japan­
ese people, and the universal and com­
pulsory service in army and navy gives
not only training in military tactics but
in the ‘ ' seven duties of the soldier ’ ’—
loyalty, valour, patriotism, obedience,
humility, morality, and honour with an
insistence ugon frugality, simplicity* and
a Spartan existence. Yet withal a
loudly hearted, laughter-loving people.
The glorification of the war ideal is
shown in an official Staff pamphlet that
declares it 4‘ the father of all creative
work, the mother of culture, the vital
energy and driving force of the State.”
From half to three-quarters of the na­
tional budget is spent for militaristic
purposes. Even the leaders of 4
4big
business,” the eight families in whose
hands are concentrated the wealth of
Japan, live most frugally and have as
their ideal that business should be con­
ducted in reverent patriotism for the
greater glory of the nation. No ricn
man is criticized for making too much
money, since by tradition he lives most
simply, and his profits are put into that
which means national glory and upbuild­
ing, whether in art treasures or new
factories.
In Japan the Emperor is not only
chief executive but exercises also the
legislative power with the consent of the
Imperial Diet, which also has the power
to introduce legislation. The Diet is
made up of a House of Peers, (included
in which are special members nominated
by the Emperor for meritorious service
to the State or for erudition) and a
House of Representatives elected by
general manhood suffrage since 1925.
China, a monarchy for four millenia«
became on 12 February 1912 a Republic.
China, so long known as the 4
4change­
less,” is now a seething cauldron of new
and revolutionary ideals. Though old
China was considered an absolute mon­
archy, it always had a form of popular
representation through a Censorate or
Board of Control, whose duty it was to
examine all official acts of Ministry and
Cabinet, to institute inquiries, raise
objections to such measures as were
deemed detrimental to the best interests
of the country, and even to stop them
entirely. Many times were the personal
doings of an Emperor reproved by the
censors with more candour and plainness
than would be shown by high functi|yir
aries in European monarchies.
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y EA R BOOK, 1937

Just as old China had an unusual
type of Monarchy, so has new China an
unusual type of Republic. *
The National Government at Nanking
(March, 1936) is a Committee form of
Government appointed by and respon­
sible to the Kuomintang or National
People’s Party who are acting, during
the peripd of Educative Government (or
political tutelage) as trustees of the
people. Dr. Sun Yat Sen, founder of
the Kuomintang, in 1928 stated the
three essential principles of the new
Republic :
(1) Nationalism (National emancipa­
tion and racial equality). That a strong
national consciousness must be develop­
ed and the people welded into one
slrong organic group. That the old
learning, the old creative and inventive
power must be revived, and 4
4we must
go out to learn what is best in the
West.”
(2) Democracy (Political rights for
the people). Dr. Sun stated that China
had little to learn from the West as
'4in politics very little advance has been
made. ’’ The Chinese had had too great
a personal freedom in the past which now
they must 4
4sacrifice . . . in order to
gain national freedom.” 4
4China has
to face two problems . . . how to have
a strong central government and at the
same time to remove the fear of the
people of such government.”
(3) Socialism (Economic rights for
the peasants and workers). Dr. Sun
insisted that 4
4we must centre all our
problems around the welfare of the
people ’’ and avoid the western mistake
of taking 4
4material problems as the
central point in human history. None
of the forms of Socialism developed in
the West are fitted for our own country.
China has to avoid the dangers of
industrialism. Our great and immedi­
ate problem is not economic inequality
but economic poverty, not a fight
against capitalists, but the prevention of
the rise of capitalists in the future. Our
method of solving this problem is to
develop State industry.”
Revolutionary as he was, Dr. Sun
had a real respect for the^ancient insti­
tu tion s of China, and desired that the
new organization should be builded on
the old foundations of local self-govern­
ment which have from time immemorial
been the bedrock of Chinese society.
Since these principles were enunciated
China has been invaded by Japan
(1931) and a portion of Manchuria has
been occupied by Japan and proclaimed
a free state under the style of Manchu-
kuo, with the former Chinese Emperor
as Emperor.
A virtual protectorate has been estab­
lished by Japan over five Provinces in
North China. While self-protection
from Soviet Russia’s possible encroach­
ment through this *base upon Japan is
an avowed motive, a second and even
more fundamental ideal dominates this
aggressive policy—that of Paternalism,
a misson to form a 4
4Yellow Empire ”
for the union of nations of similar cul­
tures to resist the alleged exploitation
of white overlords. In other words
Japan is determined to save China even
from herself, and with great alarm
notes the growing friendliness of the
developing young Republic with Britain,
Soviet Russia and other alien races,
feeling that China should turn rather
to Japan, a brother nation, for counsel
and guidance.
On the other hand, Japan’s act may
be the means of bringing together the
loose elements in the Chinese State and
welding them together into a real as
well as nominal unity. Canton, strong­
ly anti-Japanese, representing Southern
China, will forget its political differences
with the Nanking or Central Govern­
ment if a determined effort is made to
repel the invader ; the large and intelli­
gent peasant Army (commonly called
the Chinese Reds), strongly entrenched
in the North-West and Far West, and
with many sympathizers throughout
bankrupt and debt-ridden a g r a r i a n
China, will forget their wrongs and
unite with the Central Gpvernment to
repel Japan ; in the seceding Northern
provinces and Manchukuo there is still
a strong pro-Chinese element that
would be glad of an opportunity to
rejoin the mother country; Young
China everywhere is eager to spring to
the defence of the Nation.
T H E T H E 0 S 0 P H 1 C A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 149
Any conflict between China and
Japan is not only a conflict of nations
but one of ideals. Age-old experience
has demonstrated that while the more
positive ideal at first seems to win the
victory, eventually the more subtle and
seemingly negative ideal either blends
or conquers. When militaristic Rome
conquered aesthetic Greece, the civil­
ization of Greece won the final vic­
tory. China and Japan have much
to give to each other and their mutual
co-operation would be of immense
benefit to the world.
The Central Government has been
making tremendous strides in internal
development with currency reforms,
measures for peasantry betterment, the
opening up of interior China through
provision of hotel facilities, the construc­
tion of railways and other means of com­
munication, the lack of which has
so greatly hampered distribution of
commodities and mutual understanding,
as withess the fact that during rice
famines some parts of the country have
been suffering from overproduction. An
attempt is being made to curb opium
production and consumption. Within
the borders of the Central provinces,
amazing progress has been made in
modernizing the form of government—
Shanghai, for example, has become a
model of civic development. In August,
1936, an edict granted equal franchise
to women.
Cultural Activities:
In both China and Japan great relig­
ious tolerance prevails, particularly for
those religions which demonstrate in
conduct the ideals reverenced. In China
the religions regarded as indigenous are
Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism.
The Japanese, always alert to anything
foreign that would be of benefit to japan,
in the 15th century sent ambassadors to
the Vatican to rendfer homage to the
Pope and opened their nation to Christ­
ian influence. But after three decades
of exploitation, the Emperor asked the
pertinent questions : *' Why do mission­
aries constrain Japanese subjects to be­
come Christians ? Persecute Buddhist
priests ? Incite their disciples to destroy
temples? Eat animals useful to men
such as cattle ? Allow invaders to
carry off #Japanese as slaves ? ” No
suitable answer forthcoming, the new
religion was extirpated, the ports of
Japan closely sealed, and for 250 years
she guarded herself in strict seclu­
sion from further contamination by
foreigners. Again, when Japan was
opened to foreign intercourse by the
American Commodore Perry, an Im­
perial Commission was ordered to
report upon the advisability of adopting
Christianity as the State religion and
reported against so adopting “ on the
ground that, judging from the moral
condition of the West, Christianity was
not there so potent an influence for
right living as were in Japan the relig­
ions (Shintoism or Way of the Gods
and Buddhism) which had so long held
sway among the island people.” In
1888 Japan sent a representative to in­
vite the President-Founder, Colonel
Olcott, to visit Japan to stimulate a
spiritual revival of Buddhism, such as
he had accomplished in Ceylon. As a
result of his tours he united in joint
action the fourteen sects of Buddhism,
and the following organizations to pro­
mote the spread of Buddhism arose : a
Young Men’s Buddhist Association,
three Buddhist universities and various
colleges, and many schools, 300 periodi­
cals advocating and defending Bud­
dhism ; an imperial Princess became
patroness of the newly-founded Bud­
dhist Women’s Society, an imperial
Prince became President of the Dasa
Sila Society to promote the obser­
vance of the Ten Precepts of Bud­
dhism, etc.
Colonel Olcott deplored the growing
trend of Japanese militarism and was
cordially 'invited by one of the Generals
to make his home in Japan, there to do
what he could to combat it, but the
Colonel’s primary work lay with The
Theosophical Society,
In Japan and China alike great re­
verence and affection have always been
paid to the teacher, the man of learning.
Both countries have compulsory ele­
mentary education in theory, though
in China voluntary teachers at^iiTate

enthusiasm to give education to the
masses. Anyone with initiative has
always been able to obtain education in
China and gain distinction, but mass
education has only come in, with New
China. In Japan in the middle school,
demand far exceeds supply and only
10% of qualified applicants get in by
competitive examination. China has
42 universities, 38 colleges and 31
technical schools and many institutes of
research ; Japan six Imperial univer­
sities and 41 other institutions of univer­
sity rank.«

In the field of religion it is for the most
part sceptical and rationalistic, and in
conjunction with the political agitation
of recent years has helped to give birth
to a widespread anti-Christian move­
ment in the ranks of ” Young China.”
More and more the student classes are
demanding to be heard on national
issues, and more than any other class
are they departing from the traditions
of Old China.
The chief moods of Chinese poetry are
a pure delight in the varying phenomena
of nature and a boundless sympathy with
the woes and sufferings of humanity.
In his love for hill and stream, which
he recognizes as peopled with genii, and
for tree and flower in which he feels a
sentient soul, the Chinese poet is seen
at his best. His views of life are deeply
tinged with melancholy and often
loaded with an overwhelming sadness.
The present day with its use of the
colloquial language for literary purposes
and its break with old conventions is
witnessing many new schools of poetry,
some of them strongly Chinese, others
with western prototypes.
One of the chief cultural outlets
of Japan is its science of flower arrange­
ment and its gardens. The aim of the
Japanese garden is to bring man closer
'pg^gture, and various means have been
Inone'& J® the, effor‘ 'to £-alize
^st^rden when the guest
stoops at the stone water basin to wash
his hands, he catches an unexpected
glimpse through the purposely obstruc­
tive trees of the shimmering sea, thus
being suddenly made to realize the
relation of the dipperful of water to
the vast expanse of sea and of himself
to the universe. Beauty is thus often
concealed so that it may be discovered
individually with a thrill of joy, and
in Japanese gardens a man’s spirit may
wander and find spiritual recreation
and sustenance.
Japan also is proposing a ” Cultural
League of Nations ” based upon a deep
understanding and ' sincere appreciation
of all national cultures and is attempting
to “ awaken the whole world to the
universal consciousness that all the
nations are the different sprouts of one
and the same tree of humanity.” This
ideal was enunciated by the First Tenno
Jimmu in the grand Edict concerning
the foundation of the Japanese Empire :
” In pursuance of the Universal Way
bequeathed by our Holy Ancestors, We,
Sovereign of this Land, should endeavour
to enlighten all mankind on the spiritual
unity of the world. Then, we shall
have to lay the foundation of the Capital
to develop this country peacefully into
a perfect Family State ; and at the same
time, this sublime ideal should be spread
to the Universe, so that distintegrated
humanity be converted into a world
family.”
Theosophy in the Far East:
Mr. Augustus F. Knudsen, President­
ial Agent, 1936-.
History : The first real touch of
Theosophy in the Far East was the visit
of the President:Fopnder to Japan in
1889before mentioned), tHougH a'gffiall
"‘Lodger -chartered in 1887 existed in
Kioto. This visit stimulated a perman­
ent revival of Buddhism in Japan and
Col. Olcott was offered by the leaders
of Buddhism as many Lodges and as
many thousand members for The Theo-
sophical Society as he wished if he
himself would settle in Japan to head
the Lodgesr China also invited him to
visit the -|pkntry, but lack of time pre­
vented. w orn 1909 the Rev. Spurgeon
Medhurst, at one-time a well-known
T H E T H E O S O P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 ÎSI
Baptist Missionary in China, worked for
the upbuilding of Theosophy. In 1916 he
was assisted by Dr. Wu Ting-Fang, the
great Chinese ambassador and states­
man, who was endeavouring to build up
the new China on the 'basis of brother­
hood. Dr. Wu Ting-Fang, while holding
high offices of State, wrote the first
Chinese Manual of Theosophy and was
president of the first native Chinese
Lodge (Shanghai).
The first Lodge in China (Saturn
Lodge) was chartered in 1920 in
Shanghai, and the work has since that
time been steadily /naintained, though
individual Lodges have risen and fallen.
The Hong Kong Lodge (now Manuk
Lodge) was chartered in 1923 with Mr.
Manuk as President, ftjr. Manuk was
appointed Presidential Agent for China,
and Hong Kong and Shanghai were
centres of his devoted work until his
passing in 1932. Shanghai and Manuk
Lodges in 1937 are vigorous centres of
Theosophy in China. Miss Dorothy
Arnold in 1925 started Theosophical
educational work in Shanghai and is
principal now of the large Besant Girls'
School, recognized throughout the pro­
vince for its high standards and cultural
advantages.
The work accomplished since 1928 in
Cochin China deserves special mention
for it strikes root mostly among the
cultured classes of Annamites and holds
charter under the French Section.
While centres have existed in Hanoi
(Tonking) and Cambodia, the active
Lodges are at Saigon (Leadbeater
Lodge) and Phuoclong (Vrais Boud-
dhistes). Miss Nguyen Tai-hai repre­
sented these Lodges (at the Diamond
Jubilee Convention. Mr. Jinarajadasa
visited Inijo-China in 1936. Splendid
work has also been done by the Russian
Section (Outside Russia) in Shanghai
(Helena plavatsky Lodge, chartered
1925); Harbin (since 1927); and Tientsin
(since 1925). In Tientsin Lodge the
devoted work of Mrs. A. Sokol has.
maintained an active centre throughout
many years of political difficulties.
In 1920 the work was revived in
Ja|)asr,^i^^T7frw
Cbusins while holding a
proTessörship in the TfUpeTiaribUniversity
of Tokyo and the. Tokyo International
Lodge was chartered under T. Suzuki
as •President. In 1924 the worF^wa^s
again stimulated by Prof. Labberton
who founded Orpheus Lodge. Mr^.
Beatrice Lane SuzuJdj wife of the fa­
mous poet-philosopher of Japan, organ­
ized the Mahayana in Kioto in
1924^. Though Ihls Lodge is at the
moment dormant, Mr;s. jäuzuki’s en­
thusiastic^ work continues to make of
Kioto a nucleus for the spreOTtSf^THeo-
sophical ideals. In 1935 the first Ani­
mal Welfare Society that ever existed
in a college in the Far East was formed
at Otani College, Kioto. Miroku Lodge
of Tokyo is an active Lodge doing
splendid work among the many national­
ities represented in their lecture audi­
ences.
Propaganda: Mr. Knudsen made a
lecture tour of China in 1936 which
raised great enthusiasm and showed
many possibilities for future expansion.
Under his direction translations are
being made of Theosophical literature
into Chinese and Japanese and he is
taking full advantage of the new ferment
of spiritual life for the spread o f
Theosophy.
THE GENEVA CENTRE
The International Centre at Geneva
has reached *such importance that the
President has determined it shall take
on a more official character and come
directly under the supervision at Adyar
of the President and the General Coun­
cil. Dr. Arundale realized during the
Geneva World Congress the vital need
for a source of Theosophical influence
in that international arena, from which
the work of the League of Nations
may be constantly affected. “ After
seeing the nature of the work of the
International Centre,” he writes. “ I H
rv
not think there can be any fo r m ^ The
city more pregnant with it*
152, THE THEOSOPHICAL YEAR BOOK, 1937
Geneva Centre was established in 1928 Kamensky. It is in close touch
by Mrs. Margaret Gpusins* with the with a" number of international move-
assist^ce^^oT^'l'he'*
"European Federa- ments, of which eighty-two of various
tion, and has been since carried on kinds have offices and activities in
with untiring devotion by Dr. Anna Geneva.
OUTPOST
There are many outposts of The Theo-
sophical Society in out of the way places
out of which future Sections will be born.
In Europe the Kitej Lodge in Es­
tonia and the
'Tierm&ny belong to the Russian Section
Outside Russia. France has two Lodges
in Luxemburg and one in Monaco (Es-
peranOtó, 1$07). In Latvia the Anjglo-
Latvm Lodge is attached"to England.
In'Cypfüs mié Hilarión Lodge is under

and Tokyo.
In T he Pacific ; Hawaiian Islands,
Honolulu Lodge .chartered 1894 by
U.S.A.
In Cen tr a ^ and South America :
The Central American Section unites
seven Republics ; Guatemala, Hon­
duras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa
Rica, Panama and Colombia. There is
a Panama Lodge in the Canal Zone
under U.S.A. The Dominican Republic
is in the Puerto Rico Section. Bolivia
is in the Argentina Section. Paraguay
and Peru were formerly Sections. There
is a Lodge at Barbados in the West
Indies.
In the past there have been Lodges in
Turkey, Gibraltar, Canary Islands,
Persia, Mauritius, Hankow, Cambodia,
Kioto (Japan), Venezuela; and in the
West Indies, Lodges in Haiti, St.
Thomas, Grenada, and Trinidad.
THEOSOPHICAL CAMPAIGNS
The spirit of Theosophy throughout
the world has been extensively and
scientifically pursued in many countries
through Campaigns initiated by the
Publicity Department at Adyar.
The “ Straight Theosophy” Cam­
paign, carried out simultaneously in all
parts of the world in the last quarter of
1935, promoted the fundamentals of
Theosophy through public lectures,
members’ meetings, distribution of pam­
phlets, and a special display of topical
books by Theosophist and other writers.
Equally successful is the Campaign on
Evolution entitled “ There Is a Plan,”
which cpqimenced on 1st October 1936
and terminates on 28th March 1937,
it covers the whole range of Evolution as
applied to the individual, to humanity and
to the living universe. The Plan is adapt­
ed to an understanding of the arts,
science, education, religions, the Hierar­
chy, and to problems of economics and
morality.
As the outcome and logical issue of
the Geneva World Congress, a “ Cam­
paign for Understanding,” is being
conducted during 1937, its aim being
to draw all nations and faiths into a
common understanding and spirit of
mutual appreciation. Were everybody
so at work’* Dr. Arundale says, “ the
world would soon emerge from the
shadow of war.”

The Theosophical Society as a body
was Comparatively inactive; its By­
laws became/a dead letter, its meetings
almost ceased . # *the signs of its grow­
Pancoast, and
ing influence are found in the increase
of home and foreign correspondence,
controversial articles in the Press, the
establishment of Branch societies at
London and Corfu and the opening up
of relations with sympathizers in India
and Ceylon. Influential Spiritualists who
joined had all withdrawn; meetings
in hired room discontinued ; fees upon
entrance of members abolished and The
Society’s maintenance devolved entirely
upon the two Co-Founders. 1

idea was never more vigorous, nor |he
movement more full of vitality, than
when it was divested of its external
corporateness, and its spirit was com­
pressed into our brains, hearts and
souls.”

THE THEOSOPHICAL ORDER
OF SERVICE
The Theosophical Order of Service
is a world-wide association founded by
Dr. Annie Besant for the service of
humanity without distinction of race,
creed, sex, caste or colour. Its aims
are : (1) To minimize the sum of
misery in the world ; (2) To forget
self in working for others ; (3) To
eliminate selfishness and substitute love
as the rule of the world ; (4) To live to
the highest that is within us.
The International Organizer is Mr.
D. Jeffrey Williams, appointed at the
Geneva World Congress 1936. The
organization is adapted to the needs
of individual countries, but generally
each of his representatives in the
different Sections appoints a cabinet,
with one member at the head of each
of the following departments: Social
Service, Animal Welfare, World Peace,
Harmonious Living, Healing, Arts and
Crafts.
The Order is doing much useful
work on practical humanitarian lines,
individual members putting the ideal­
ism of Theosophy into practice in
innumerable leagues and institutions
for world peace, clean politics, edu­
cation, prison reform, humane treatment
of animals, etc. As an example may
be cited the work of the late Mr.
Arthur Burgess, who called together a
group of organizations working in
London against capital punishment
which formed the National Council for
the abolition of the Death Penalty.
Address of Mr. D. Jeffrey Williams
(International Organizer) : 82 Boundary
Road, London, N.W.8, England. (Tel.
Maida Vale 7966).
" The life of love never gives liberation front service; the uttermost
service is the most perfect freedom." —Annie Besant.
THEOSOPHICAL WORLD CONGRESSES
1. Paris, 1921 #
•
2. Adyar, 1925
3. Chicago, 1929
4. Geneva, 1936 *
The first suggestion for an Interna­
tional Convention of The Theosophical
Society was made by Dr,. Arundale while
General'Secretary for England, 1915-
1916. His purpose was, in view of the
mighty reconstruction *‘ which was tak­
ing place, to survey and mstp out our
Society's duty to the New World, and
to cement^ still more strongly those ties
of Brotherhood between the members
of our various Sections upon the strength
of which rapid progress from discord to
hairiiibhy so much depends."
The Paris Congress, decided on be­
fore the War, was held 23-26 July 1921.
There were over 1,400 delegates, from
thirty-nine countries, of which nineteen
were represented by their General Sec­
retaries. The newspapers said that
Dr. Besant’s audience in the great
amphitheatre of the Sorbonne on July
26 comprised " the leading men in
diplomacy, science, and the University
of Paris, headed by its Rector." Her
subject was "Theosophy." At this
Congress Mr. J. Krishnamurti definitely
entered on his public life of service, and
presided over a Conference of the Order
of the Star in the East on July 27
and 28.
The Adyar World Congress was the
Golden Jubilee Convention of 1925,
memorable for an attendance of 3,000
delegates, from all parts of the world,
while visitors to the public lectures more
than doubled this number. Forty
countries were represented.
An important Message from an Elder
Brother was read, asserting that The
Theosophical Society once more found
itself *‘ a body over the face of which
broods the Spirit from beyond the
Great Range."
Dr. Besant announced that the work
of the next half century was comprised
in three institutions destined to become
world-wide : The World Religion, The
World University, The World Govern­
ment (by the restoration of the Mys­
teries) .
Dr. Besant, who presided over the
C h i c a g o World Congress, 24-29
August 1929, characterized it as " a
magnificent success." N e a r l y two
thousand delegates attended. The
Congress culminated in the dispatch
of a message from the President of The
Theosophical Society to the President
of the United States (Mr. Herbert
Hoover) praying him “ to lead the
Nations of the world to the outlawry of
war and to the establishment of arbitra­
tion for the decision of international
disputes."
The septennial recurrence of the
World Congress, whibh was interrupted
by the Adyar gathering in 1925, was
resumed at Geneva in 1936, the key­
note of the Congress being " Justice."
This note was sounded throughout a
splendid symposium of eminent Theo­
sophical speakers : Justice for the Na­
tions, for World Faiths, for Youth, etc.
Over six hundred delegates were pres­
ent, representing five continents and
about twenty five countries. Among
the Congress highlights were official
welcomes from the Swiss Government,
the City of Geneva, the League of
Nations, and a luncheon to the Congress
delegates from humanitarian movements
with headquarters in Geneva, headed
by the Duchess of Hamilton and Miss
Lind-af-Hageby.
This was the first World Congress
presided over by Dr. Arundale. He
describes it as " a very great success, ’ ’
its real title to the epithet lying ‘ 4in the
fine release of happiness and enthusiasm
which started from the very first day
and culminated in a great wave of joyous
friendliness at the close."
The outcome of the Congress was
Dr. Arundale's 1937 Campaign for
Understanding to "counteract, at least
to some extent, the extraordinary pre­
valence of that misunderstanding, which
164
T H E T H E O SO P H IC A L Y E A R BOOK, 1937 165
sooner or later breaks out in its virulent
forms of ill-will and war.”
The Congress was followed by a
Summer School on Art and Beauty.
THE DIAMOND JUBILEE
Ten years after the Golden Jubilee of
The Theosophical Society (referred to
above under the Adyar World Con­
gress), came the Diamond Jubilee, a
magnificent celebration at the Inter­
national Headquarters. Over 1,500 mem­
bers attended, representing practically all
the fifty-four nations. The unique
features of this Convention were :
1. It was a 1' family affair, ’’ because
throughout the world ‘ ' our brethren
were celebrating as we were celebrating
at Adyar,” not only with meetings and
addresses, but with tremendous goodwill
and friendliness.
2. The President struck the domi­
nant note of the existence of the Evolu­
tionary Plan Time and again he
stressed the fact that life is ever Plan-
fulfilling, but it is by no means yet
Plan-Conscious. His slogan— “ There
Is a Plan ’ ’—was carried forward
into “ The Plan of Evolution Cam­
paign,” which was pursued during
1936-37. Other aphorisms which the
President spread were : ‘ ' Think Theo-
sophically Ahead” and “ Win the
World to Theosophy.”
3. The Diamond Jubilee marked a
new development in the presentation of
Theosophy as Beauty. This the Presi­
dent presented as the fifth interpretation
of Theosophy to the outer world, the
earlier four being (1) the aspect of
cosmic and eternal wisdom through
the Founders ; (2) Dr. Besant’s inter­
pretation in terms of Will and Activ­
ity ; (3) Bishop Leadbeater’s in­
terpretation in terms of the larger
science; an$ (4) Krishnamurti’s inter­
pretation in terms of individual unique­
ness and self-sufficiency. The new
epoch of creative art was ushered in
with an Indian dance recital.by Shrimatl
Rukmini l5evi, which was held by art
critics and many orthodox Hindus as
inaugurating a new era in art in India
and giving to the religious science of
dancing its reverent due after long
centuries of comparative degradation.
Under the inspiration of this event,
the International Academy of the Arts
with headquarters at Adyar was estab­
lished, with the two-fold object of
emphasizing the essential Unity of all
true Art, and to working for the recogni­
tion of the Arts as inherent in effective
individual, national and r e l i g i o u s
growth. Thus, The Theosophical
Society once again initiated a grea£
world movement, as it had previously
released other significant teachings on
other lines of thought.
The Diamond Jubilee addresses were
delivered by Mr. Hirendra Nath Datta
(Vice-President), Mn ”^ jinarajadasa,
Prof. J. Emile Marcault, and Mr. Geoff­
rey Hodson, the President closing the
Convention with an exhortation to the
members to “ Look Forward to the
Future.”
The World Federation of Young
Theosophists came into being, with
Shnmati R ukmini Devi as International
instructed by Dr. Arundale to give the
Youth Federation all possible recogni­
tion and encouragement.
The Subba Row MedaJjwas awarded
to Dr. Arundale for his continuous con­
tributions to Theosophical literature over
a period of years, particularly for his
output during 1935 of You, Freedom
and Friendship, and Gods in the
Becoming.
The Golden Jubilee of the Adyar
Library, founded by Colonel Olcott on
December 29, 1885, was celebrated on
December 29, 1935, when an Adyar
Library Association was formed to pro­
mote its scholarly and cultural influence
throughout the world.
THEOSOPHY S CLASSIC LITERATURE
The following list of fifty or more “ classic ” Theosophical
works istgiven, nof with the idea of suggesting that there is

AT THE FEET OF THE R A S­
TER is ” a book of precepts, a bible,
a sacred scripture in miniature, vital
to the world of today, vital to all who
would tread the Way of Holiness and
reach that Freedom which is perfect
Service. It has been an inspiration to
me for many years, and in it I find
priceless guidance expressed in simplest
and clearest language. There would be
few problems confronting either indi­
viduals or nations were its advice to be
followed.” (G. S. Arundale).

YOUTH ACTIVITIES
WORLD FEDERATION OF
«
¡
W
T he Young Theosophists came into
existence at the Vienna Congress in
1923, at a time when youth the world
over was waking up to its responsibility
to build a better world. The Movement
spread very quickly. Of recent years,
the aipa has been to transcend the
national point of view and to work inter­
nationally.
The World Federation of Young
Theosophists was inaugurated at the
Diamond Jubilee Convention 1935 and
is gathering membership and momentum,
and becoming effective in organization.
The World Federation incorporates
Existing National Federations and Groups
in numerous countries. The World
President, Shrimati Rukmini Devi, was !
already President, as she still is, of ‘
several National Federations before the j
world union.
The objects of the World Federation
a re: (1) To spread the teachings of
YOUNG THEOSOPHISTS
Theosophy among the youth of the
world ; (2) To support and strengthen
in all possible ways The Theosophical
Society ; (3) To promote good citizen­
ship—national and international.
Young Theosophists work in special
ways in different places. The youth of
the universités offer a fine field in many
countries, specially India and America,
The Youth of Adyar maintain close touch
with the student youth of Madras, and
a recent festival at Adyar was attended
by over 500 Madras students of both
sexes.
Youth Day at the Geneva World
Congress 1936 was conspicuous for con­
structive plans for the future work of
the World Federation. Members are
actively supporting the Campaigns of the
two World presidents (Dr. Arundaleandf
Shrimati Rukmini Devi) for Understand*;'
ing and for Art and Beauty. >

Round Table plan and ceremonial to
the particular needs of the community,

THE LOTUS CIRCLE
The Lotus Circle held its first group
meeting 30-11-1892 in the Aryan Lodge,
New York. Stories and songs were
written and the werk spread to other
countries. London Lodge ( A v e n u e
Road, 1894) gave it a tremendous
impetus and a knightly character under
Ethel Mallet and Herbert Whyte.
When Bishop Leadbeater went to reside
at Avenue Road in 1895 he took charge
of the Movement. In 1900, when he
left for America, he gave the Lotus
Circle in charge of Captain Herbert
Whyte and others. The Lotus Lodge
was formed hy them, and Capt. and
Mrs. Whyte produced the Lotus Journal
In 1907, the idea of turning this young
people’s activity into an Order of
Chivalry came to Capt. Whyte, and
with the help of Dr. Besant and soxfle
of her friends the Round Table was
inaugurated in July of that year. Thus
out of the Lotus Circle grew the Round
Table, but the Lotus Circle has continued
over the world a source of inspiration
to many children.
THE GOLDEN CHAIN
A movement mainly for children, ex­
pressing the Principle of Love Universal
in its pledge :
I am a Link in The Golden Chain of Love
that Btretches Round the World, and I muBt
keep my Link bright and strong. I will try to
be kind and gentle to every Jiving thing I meet
and to protect and help all who are weaker than
myself. I will try to think pure and beautiful
thoughts, to speak pure and beautiful words,
and to do pure and beautiful actions. May every
Link in The Golden Chain become Bright and
Strong.
It was founded in 1899 by Wm. John
Walters of the United States, and pro­
tected throughout many years by Dr.
Annie Besant. It is now an Interna­
tional organization and affiliated with the
Theosophical Order of Service through
the Order of the Round Table, of which
it forms the Junior Section. Each Link,
Group, or Country is perfectly free to
work in any way it chooses. Creative
expression and correspondence between
Links is encouraged.

THE GOLDEN STAIRS
A clean life, an open mind, a pure
heart, an eager intellect, an unveiled
spiritual perception, a brotherliness for
all, a valiant defence of those unjustly
attacked, a courageous endurance of per­
sonal injustice and suffering, a genuine
search after Truth, a love for all living
creatures, and a constant eye to the
ideal of human progression and perfec­
tion which the Sacred Science depicts.—
These are the golden stairs up the steps
of which the Learner must climb to
the Temple of Divine Wisdom.— H. P.

MASTERS.

ally as a conversationist, with hear social
accomplishments, wide travels, and ex­
traordinary adventures.

philology, racial origins, fundamental
bases of religions, and keys to old
mysteries and symbols.”

privately in England, Germany, France;
honours in botany at Preliminary
Science Exam. Lond. Univ. and at
South Kensington Science and Art
Exam. In 1872 broke with the Church
of England and ruined her social
position through her passion for Truth.
Joined the National Secular Society,
1874 ; worked in the Free Thought and
Radical movements led by Charles
Bradlaugh, M.P. ; was co-editor with
him of the National Reformer ; wrote
many political and free-thought books
and pamphlets, 1874-88 ; was promi­
nent in the Labour and Socialist
movements and member of Fabian
Society and Social Democratic Feder­
ation ; took active part in Trades Union
work among unskilled labourers, and
with Herbert Burrows led great Match
Girls’ Strike to successful conclusion ;
aided defence of public meeting in
London ; was member London School
Board (for Tower Hamlets), 1887-90,
but refused re-election. In 1889, there
was scarcely any modern reform for
which she had not worked, written,
spoken, and suffered: women’s suff­
rage and equal rights, better housing,
school meals, abolition of sweated
wages, penal reforms, Empire Federa­
tion, antivivisection, organization of
Trade Unions, reform of land laws, the
right to freedom of thought and speech,
a reformed system of electorates, the
rights of subject peoples (championing
the cause of Afghanistan, 1879 ; the
Transvaal, 1881 ; Ireland, 1882 and
afterwards ; Egypt, 1882 ; the Soudan,
1885 ; working with Charles Bradlaugh
and Dadabhai Naoroji for India).
Materialistic philosophy failed to satisfy
her truth-seeing mind and heart from
1886, in spite of its appeal through
ideal of disinterested service to mankind.
Two Theosophical books by A. P.
Sinnett suggested a new line of in­
vestigation. “ From that time forward
I looked for other clues,” she said.
*‘ I had experimented then and before in.
Spiritualism and found many facts and
much folly in it. In 1899 I had a book-
given me to review . . . entitled
The Secret Doctrine . . . I knew
on studying that book that I had found
the clue I had been seeking, and I then
asked for an introduction to the writer,
feeling that one who had written it
might tell something of a path along*
which I might travel.” She joined
The Theosophical Society, 10 May
1889, and became devoted pupil and
helper of H. P. Blavatsky. “ The one
and the only one,” with prophetic
vision wrote H.P.B. of Annie Besant
in 1890. A.B. was appointed before
Mme. Blavatsky’s passing in 1891 aa
‘ ‘ Chief Secretary of the Inner Group*
of the Esoteric Section and Recorder of
the Teaching, ’ ’ and as her successor in
Outer Headship of the Esoteric
Section. Among other duties, she had
the custodianship of H .P.B .’s un­
published teachings, as explained by
the President-Founder in 1891 at the-
European Convention a few months
after H .P.B.'s passing : “ H.P.B,
has not gone away and left us absolutely
without unpublished remains ; on the
contrary she has left a large body of
them, and in the custody of her chosen
depositary, Mrs. Besant, who, in the pro­
per way and at the proper moment, will
give them out to the world.” Following,
the death of H.P.B., Mrs. Besant

pledged l^r utter l o y a l t y to the
Founder-President and the rCause of
Theosophy, and ever remained faithful
to her vow. In 1892, the first of the
Theosophical Manuals was written by
her, and from that time forward her
pen and voice were constantly used in
the exposition of Theosophy. (See
publications below.) In 1893 she re­
presented The Theosophical Society at
the World Parliament of Religions in
Chicago, U.S.A. 1893-4 she made a
$j$or of Indian Lodges ip the company
o f the President-Founder, whose Guru
told him that here was the promised
¡ Messenger to aid him. By her splendid
presentation of Indian philosophy and
|iier undisguised personal preference for
the Indian religions, she won support
o f most orthodox Brahmins to Theos­
ophy. In 1893 she started her famous
Annual Convention lectures, which with
a very few years’ exception, were con­
tinued till her last illness. Most of her
best-known published works are lectures
:given at Conventions or on tour. From
this time forward until 1930, she
travelled the globe over in the service
of the T.S. ; 1895 awarded the Subba
Row Medal. In 1887 reorganized
American Section. In 1907, was
nominated by the President-Founder as
his successor, and subsequently elected
as President of the T.S. ; re-elected,
1914, 1921, and 1928. As President
and as an individual, she protected and
co-operated with many reform and
forward-looking movements : L.C.C. ;
the Theosophical Order of Service,
with its many Leagues ; The Round
Table; Golden Chain. Organized
Indian Boy Scout Movement (1918) for
which she was appointed by Lord
Baden-Powell “ Honorary Commission­
er for all India of the Boy Scouts Assn. ”
and 5 Oct. 1932 was awarded the
'' Silver Wolf ’’ for her service to the
movement. In Co-Masonry she pioneer­
ed in Britain in 1902, India in 1903,
later becoming M.P.G.C. of the British
Federation, and Sov. Lieut. G. C. of
the Supreme Council of International
•Co-Masonry, and 33° Mason. Always
John the Baptist, her London Lectures
in 1909 and 1911 culminated in the
announcement of the appearance of a
Great Teacher in the not distant future,
who would give a fresh spiritual im­
pulse to a distracted world. She warned,
however, that the Teacher’s message
would be striking, even challenging,
appealing to intuition rather than intel­
lect. She protected the world-wide
Order of the Star in the East, herald of
the Coming. “ Her radiant spirit re­
kindled India’s faith in her own ideals
and destiny.” (Sarojini Naidu), In
India she worked for many social
reforms : the abolition of child-marriage
and the reform of tlje caste-system. Her
early years’ work went to the revival and
uplifting of eastern faiths, and especially
of Hinduism. Then came her edu­
cational work : #
the founding of the Cen­
tral Hindu College, Benares, (1898-9),
the Central Hindu Girls’ School
(1904), and the aid given in founding
the Hindu University, serving on
Court, Council and Senate ; her lectures
to Hindu College students, inspiring
them with patriotism and devotion to
the Motherland. “ She made men.”
(C. J.) Finally her work for the Freedom
of the Motherland, the dignity of an
Indian Nation, a self-ruled member of
the British Commonwealth of Nations.
She founded the Home Rule League
and was elected President, 1916. Though
she stressed the need for constitutional
procedure, her work brought her into
conflict with the authorities, and in 1917
she was interned; but three months
later her unconditional release was
ordered, amidst scenes of tumultuous
enthusiasm. Shortly afterwards she was
elected President of the Indian National
Congress, but owing to her firm attitude
against all violence, she lost popularity
with the masses. General Secretary
National Convention of India, 1923.
The Commonwealth of India Bill
which she drew up in consultation with
Indian opinion was introduced in H.
of Commons in 1921, and passed Second
Reading. Dr. Besant’s attitude to the
struggle between two possible World-
Empires was defined after the outbreak
of the Great War, when she declared that
Great Britain in standing for freedom,
with e v e r-increasing self-government

of peoples, was destined to be a
Protector of Humanity.
On 20 Sept. 1933, she laid aside her
body at Adyar, passing as she had
lived—A Warrior Soul; yet withal so
tender that of her the poet Gerald
Massey in 1879 wrote :
“ You have soul enough for seven ;
Life enough the earth to leaven ;
Love enough to create heaven ! ’ ’

educ. Madras; has~travelTe3 in many
countries; specially interested in the
regeneration of Indian women, in the
revival of Indian culture, and in the
Arts. In Jan. 1936 founded International
Academy of the Arts at Adyar : objects
(1) To emphasize the essential unity
of all true A rt; (2) To work for the
recognition of the Arts as inherent
in effective individual, national and
religious growth. On 15 March 1936
gave a dance recital in the Adyar
Theatre inaugurating the fifth inter­
pretation of Theosophy as Beauty;
Y E A R H iP K , 1937 187 BASU, U P E N D R A N A T H
critics acclaimed her a genius of the
dance, with great promise for the fu­
ture. Was inspired to dance by Anna
PavlcfaaT^In summer 1936 toured FGrO*—
p&ajT'l-tections and addressed Geneva
/World Congress on “ The Message of
Beauty to Civilization.” ^Her marriage
in 1920, to Dr. George S. Arundale,
aroused a storm of protest from orthodox
Hindus, but his long services to India,
specially in educational and political
fields, and his association with India’s
foremost leaders eventually reconciled
the people to what would normally have
been regarded almosjt as an attack upon
Hinduism itself. Address: Adyar,

hidden side of life ; Lover of Humanity
and Spiritual Teacher of tens of thou­
sands ; Co-workes with Dr. Annie
Besant for over forty years in The Theo-
•sophical Society, b. 17-2-47, North­
umberland, England. Elder son of
Charles and Emm^ Leadbeater. His
parents, while orthodox, were in contact
with occult thought, and as a child he ^
met the famous occultist, BuIwerXytton,
at “-Ills fatliei r
s“’ home, and witnessed
phenomena in Lytton’s presence. His
future powers were presaged by an
early inemory of past lives. At thirteen
he went with his parents and younger
brother Gerald to Brazil, whither his
father, a director of a company con­
structing a line from Bahia, was sent to
supervise construction. The father and
brothers were captured by insurgents
in a local rebellion, all being required to
trample on the Cross. All three refus­
ing, the father escaped, Gerald was
killed, and Charles was tortured, but
was later rescued by his father and a
Negro servant. Returning to England,
he was about to enter Oxford, when the
family was ruined in the Overend Gur­
ney smash, cutting short this phase of
his education. He entered a bank, but
after two years decided on taking holy
orders. His education never ceased,
however, and in later life he was known
for his minute and accurate knowledge
on innumerable subjects. He was a
keen student of astronomy. Took orders
in the Church of England 1878. He
was a High Churchman, on one occasion
preaching in St. Paul’s at a Gregorian
commemoration. Personally investi­
gated Spiritualism during this period.
While still a curate at Liphook, Hants,
[ in the parish of his uncle, who was the
rector, C.W .L. was attracted to Thao*
sophical teaching by the writings o f
A. P. Sinrtett. He met Mme Blavatsky
several times. He was received into the
London ¿Lodge in 1883 at the same
meeting as Sir William Crookes. On
receiving two letters from his Master»
he decided to go to Adyar in 1884, and
under instructions joined H.P.B. at
Cairo. Took Pansil as a Buddhist from
the High Priest Sumangala in Colombo,
1884. Arrived in Adyar in Dec., 1884.
Rec. Sec. T. S. 1884-8, succeeding
Damodar K. iSlavalankar. In the eastern
octagonal bungalow in Adyar, he un-
fcided and perfected his psychic faculties
under the inner guidance of his Guru.
Accompanied H.S.O. on first Buyna.
tour, 1885. Appointed by H.S.O. on
first T.S. Exec. Ctee ’85. Accompanied

affairs of the Buddhist Theosophical
Society and its educational movement.
Founded Ananda College, Colombo.
Spent about three months of each year
in India. Wrote his Smaller Buddhist
Catechism, a classic. 1888-9 recalled to
Adyar by H.S.O. to edit The Theos-
ophist, serving at the same time as Gen.
Sec., Ceylon. He returned to England
in 1889 with C. Jinarajadasa. Acted for
two years as tutor of Mr. Sinnett’s son
and of G. S. Arundale Worked for a.
while in the London office of The
Pioneer. In 1893 he started the clair­
voyant investigations which terminated
only with his passing over forty years
later. In 1894 he published The Astral
Plane. In 1895 he investigated with
Dr. Annie Besant by clairvoyance the
conditions of the Mental Plane (Deva-
chan) and wrote afterwards The Deva-
chanic Plane. Together both began
the investigations in Occult in Chemis­
try, published later as a joint work.
1895-9 was a member of the household
of workers at 19, Avenue Road, London,
N.W. ; 1896-1906 he made lecturing
tours of many countries in Europe*
America, Australasia, etc. In 1906, much
acrimonious discussion was caused by
the fact that when asked by certain
youths for help in cases of sex difficulty»
X .E AD BE A TE R , C. W . •

ie had suggested measures which have
-since been recognized as admissible by
medical authorities of the' last two
decades. Immediately he resigned from
the T.S., discontinuing this advice. But
in 1908 by a unanimous vote of all
General Secretaries, he was invited
to return, and in February, 1909,
he came again to-Adyar, where he
wrote' lectured, and continued his clair­
voyant researches. Many of his most
famous books were published in this
period of six years, several in collabora­
tion with Dr. Besant, who examined
with him by clairvoyance many Akashic
records, written out by them in Mah:
Whence, Mow'and Whither. In 1913,
he »»went to Sydney, Australia, where he
fixed his abode, and in 1922 became
head of The Manor, a community house
at Mosman, overlooking Sydney Har­
bour. There gathered around him for
training pupils young and old from
Australia, Java, U.S.A. and India.
In 1916, he entered the Liberal Catholic
Church (see Wedgwood), and was con­
secrated Bishop. He was elected Re­
gionary Bishop of Australia in 1922
with the Church of St. Alban, Sydney,
as his episcopal seat. Later became
Presiding Bishop of the L.C.C. Joined
the Order of International Co-Free­
masonry, T5; acted as R.W .M .; M.E.Z.,
M .W .S., and attained 33°. For some
years Administrator-General for Co-
Freemasonry in Australia, and Senior
Knight of the International Order of the
Round Table. With characteristic
care, he undertook a series of investi­
gations into the hidden side of Church
sand Masonic ceremonial and embodied
them in a most interesting series of
books. Among other tours from Austra­
lia, he attended the Golden Jubilee,
Adyar, 1925. In 1927 he again made
Adyar his home. After a visit to the
Continent and England, in 1931, he
returned to Adyar and was with Dr.
Besant during her long illness. He
took part in the Convention of 1933,
giving a lecture entitled Annie Besant
as Occultist. Upon her passing in
September 1933, he succeeded her as
Outer Head of the E. S. In the course
of a voyage to Sydney, he passed away in
Perth, West Australia, on 1 March 1934,
and his remains were taken to Sydney
for cremation.

Of Bishop Lea<Jbeater in his 77th

colleague, united to him by ties un­
breakable, knowing him as none other
living in the outer world knows him, I
stand by him in storm and sunshine
Our world is not the world of
transient phenomena, but the world of
Power, of Wisdom, of Right Activity,
and we strive together to serve our
Elder Brethren, careful only to make
ourselves the channels of the One Will
in the Service of which is perfect

The Authentic History of The Theosophical Society
By.COL. H. S. OLCOTT
The pioneering adventure of Theosophy is still, and ever will
be, going on and on. Fortunately the doings of the Founders
sixty years ago were written down by the President-Founder in
his diaries, and much of this material has been published in
these volumes. *
VOL. I : Records the historic meeting of the Co-Founders and
the founding of The Society in New York, 1875, with most
readable historical detail. c
VOL. II. 1878-83: The Colonel narrates his travels in India and
Ceylon while he was firmly establishing The Society; also
c wonderful phenomena by H. P. Blavatsky. . .

Masters in travels; the final fixing of The Society’s Head­
quarters at A dyar; H.P.B.’s last departure from India; the
Coulomb troubles; the opening of the famous Adyar Library
and the subsequent growth of The Society and its literature
are all vividly portrayed.
VOL. IV. 1887-1892: During these years the President-Founder
travelled round the world, visiting Japan, Ceylon, Europe,
Australia, America, Burma, besides making long lecture tours
in India. The advent of Annie Besant, the passing of Madame
Blavatsky, and the President-Founder’s meeting with King
Oscar of Sweden are some of the outstanding happenings
covered by this volume.
VOL. V. 1893-1895: Annie Besant’s first Indian tour, her work
for India; the difficulties in America; the formation of the
Australasian Section ; a review of the progress of The Society
during its first twenty years ; and the commencement of the
Convention series of lectures.

journeys; his experiments in hypnotism and mesmerism in
France; the final shape of The Society’s constitution safeguard­
ing the freedom of each member.
