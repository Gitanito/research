  Krishna :   &nbsp; Hindu   Faith, &nbsp;2000 B.C. &nbsp;Holy Scripture: Bhagavad-Gita

Who in all   his work sees God, he in truth goes unto God....

He is the   never-created Creator of all: he knows all, ... the creator of all time.... From   him comes the transmigration of life and liberation: bondage in time and freedom   Eternity.

The   transmigration of life, takes place in one's own mind. Let one therefore keep   the mind pure, for what a man thinks that he becomes: this is a mystery of   Eternity.

The   Spirit, without moving, is swifter than the mind; the senses cannot reach him:   He is ever beyond them. ...

... the   Spirit though one, takes new forms in all things that live. He is within all,   and is also outside.

The Spirit   that is in all beings is immortal in them all: for the death of what cannot die,   cease thou to sorrow.

At the   moment of death the sum of all the experiences of life on earth comes to the   surface of the mind-for in the mind are stored all the impressions of past deeds   and the dying man then becomes absorbed in these experiences.

  Moses &nbsp; Jewish   Faith, 1330.B C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holy Scripture: Old Testament

A good name is   better than fine perfume, and the day of death better than the day of birth.   Ecclesiastes 7:1

...the   dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave   it. Ecclesiastes 12:7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

...he who   goes down to the grave does not return.&nbsp;    Job 7:9

... Even though I   walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for you are with   me...Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will   dwell in the house of the Lord forever. &nbsp;Psalms   23: 1-6

  Buddha &nbsp;&nbsp; Buddhist   Faith, &nbsp;560 B.C. Holy Scripture: Tipitaka Quotes from: &nbsp;(The Tibetan Book of the   Dead)

First of   all there will appear to you, swifter than lightning, the luminous splendor of   the colorless light of Emptiness, and that will surround you on all sides.   ...Try to submerge yourself in that light, giving up all belief in a separate   self, all attachment to your illusory ego.

...   Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will for seven days appear to you in their benign and   peaceful aspect. Their light will shine upon you, ... Wonderful and delightful   though they are, The Buddhas may nevertheless frighten you. Do not give in to   your fright! Do not run away! Serenely contemplate the spectacle before you!   Overcome your fear, and feel no desire! Realize that these are the rays of the   grace of the Buddhas, who come to receive you into their Buddha-realms. Pray to   them with intense faith and humility, &nbsp;...

But if you   miss it, you will next be confronted with the angry deities, &nbsp;... threatening   you and barring your passage ... &nbsp;because you turned a deaf ear to the saving   truths of religion. All these forms are strange to you, ... &nbsp;they terrify you,   ... &nbsp;and yet it is you who have created them. Do not give in to your fright,   &nbsp;... flee them not! They are but ... the contents of your own mind... If at this   point you should manage to understand that, &nbsp;... and you will find yourself in a   paradise among the angels.

The   judgment: &nbsp;You are now before Yama, King of the Dead. In vain will you try   to...deny or conceal the evil deeds you have done. ... the mirror in which Yama   seems to read your past is your own memory, and also his judgment is your own.   It is you yourself who pronounce your own judgment, ...

  Christ      Christian Faith, &nbsp;1 A.D. &nbsp;&nbsp;Holy Scripture: &nbsp;New Testament &nbsp;

...Whoever   hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be   condemned; he has crossed over from death to life. ...

I am the   resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies;   and whoever lives and believes in me will never die.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John 11:25,26-5:24

If there   is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body...And just as we have borne   the likeness of earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the man from   heaven.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I Corinthians 15:50

So we fix   our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen. For what is seen is   temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II Corinthians 4:18

The spirit   gives life the flesh is of no avail.&nbsp;John 6:63

...The   body without the spirit is dead. ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James 2:26

As long as   we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord... and would prefer to be   away from the body and at home with the Lord. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II Corinthians   5:5-6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Nothing in   all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare   before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hebrews 4:13

God will   give to &nbsp;each person according to what he has done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romans 2:6

  Muhammad      Muslim Faith, 622 A.D &nbsp;&nbsp;Holy Scripture: Qur'an

They know the   outward shows of this life present but of the next life are they careless. Have   they not consider the heavens and the earth and all that is between them but for   a serious end, and for a fixed term? But truly most men believe not that they   shall meet their Lord. &nbsp;30:6-7

... and we   will test you with evil and with good; and unto us shall ye &nbsp;be brought back.&nbsp;   &nbsp;21:35-36

Whatever   good works ye send on before [death]... ye shall find with God.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13:20

And they   will ask thee of the spirit. Say: The spirit proceedeth at my Lord's command;   but of knowledge, only a little is given to you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17:18

On a   certain day shall every soul come to plead for itself, and every soul shall be   repaid according to its deeds; and they shall not be wronged. &nbsp;

By God ye   shall be called to account for your doings! 16:58

  Baha'u'llah &nbsp; Baha'i   Faith 1844 A.D. &nbsp;&nbsp;Holy Scripture includes writings of The Bab (the forerunner),   Baha'u'llah (the prophet founder), and 'Abdu'l-Baha &nbsp;(the son of &nbsp;Baha'u'llah)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Know, thou, that   the soul is a sign of God, a heavenly gem whose reality the most learned of men   hath failed to grasp, and whose mystery no mind, however acute, can ever hope to   unravel. It is the first among all created things to declare the excellence of   its Creator, the first to recognize His glory, to cleave to His truth, and bow   down in adoration before Him. &nbsp;... Verily I say, the human soul is exalted above   all egress and regress. &nbsp;It is still, and yet it soareth; it moveth, and yet it   is still. &nbsp;It is, in itself, a testimony that beareth witness to the existence   of a world that is contingent, as well as to the reality of a world that hath   neither beginning nor end.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The soul,   after its separation from the body, will continue to progress until it attaineth   the presence of God, in a state and condition which neither the revolution of   ages and centuries, nor the changes or chances of this world, can alter. It will   endure as long as the Kingdom of God, His sovereignty, His dominion and power   will endure. It will manifest the signs of God and His attributes, and will   reveal His loving kindness and bounty. When the human soul soareth out of this   transient heap of dust and riseth into the world of God, then veils will fall   away, and verities will come to light, and all things unknown before will be   made clear, and hidden truths be understood. &nbsp;&nbsp;

The nature   of the soul after death can never be described, nor is it meet and permissible   to reveal its whole character to the eyes of men. &nbsp;The Prophets and Messengers   of God have been sent down for the sole purpose of guiding mankind to the   straight Path of Truth.&nbsp; The purpose underlying Their revelation hath been to   educate all men, that they may, at the hour of death, ascend, in the utmost   purity and sanctity and with absolute detachment, ... The light which these   souls radiate is responsible for the progress of the world and the advancement   of its peoples ... and constitute the animating force through which the arts and   wonders of the world are made manifest.

Bring   thyself to account each day ere thou art summoned to a reckoning; for death,   unheralded, shall come upon thee and thou shalt be called to give account for   thy deeds.

... The   decrees of the Sovereign Ordainer, as related to fate and predestination, are of   two kinds. Both are to be obeyed and accepted. The one is irrevocable, the other   is, as termed by men, impending. To the former all must unreservedly submit,   inasmuch as it is fixed and settled. God however, is able to alter or repeal it.   As the harm that must result from such a change will be greater than if the   decree had remained unaltered, all, therefore, should willingly acquiesce in   what God hath willed and confidently abide by the same. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Unto each   one hath been prescribed a preordained measure, as decreed in God's mighty and   guarded Tablets. &nbsp;All that which ye potentially possess can, however, be   manifested only as a result of your own volition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Abdu'l-Baha

The wisdom   of the appearance of the spirit in the body is this: &nbsp;the human spirit is a   Divine Trust, and it must traverse all conditions, for its passage and movement   through the conditions of existence will be the means of its acquiring   perfections.

The human   spirit may be likened to the bounty of the sun shining on a mirror. The body of   man, ... &nbsp;grows and develops through the animal spirit.

This   perfected body can be compared to a mirror, and the human spirit to the sun.   Nevertheless, if the mirror breaks, the bounty of the sun continues; and if the   mirror is destroyed or ceases to exist, no harm will happen to the bounty of the   sun, which is everlasting. This spirit has the power of discovery; it   encompasses all things ...

In the   beginning of his human life man was embryonic in the world of the matrix. &nbsp;There   he received capacity and endowment for the reality of human existence. &nbsp;The   forces and powers necessary for this world were bestowed upon him in that   limited condition. In this world he needed eyes; he received them potentially in   the other. &nbsp;He needed ears; he obtained them there in readiness and preparation   for his new existence. &nbsp;The powers requisite in this world were conferred upon   him in the world of the matrix.

Therefore,   in this world he must prepare himself for the life beyond. That which he needs   in the world of the Kingdom must be obtained here. &nbsp;Just as he prepared himself   in the world of the matrix by acquiring forces necessary in this sphere of   existence, so, likewise, the indispensable forces of the divine existence must   be potentially attained in this world.

That world   beyond is a world of sanctity and radiance; therefore, it is necessary that in   this world he should acquire these divine attributes. In that world there is   need of spirituality, faith, assurance, the knowledge and love of God. These he   must attain in this world so that after his ascension from the earthly to the   heavenly Kingdom he shall find all that is needful in that eternal life ready   for him.

The mind   and spirit of man advance when he is tried by suffering. ... &nbsp;&nbsp;so suffering and   tribulation free man from the petty affairs of this worldly life until he   arrives at a state of complete detachment. &nbsp;
