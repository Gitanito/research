  		              		Experience Description   

    This happened when I was 4 years old.  I was riding my bicycle late evening and school just started that year. One day, close to the weekend, a school bus driver honked at me while I was riding my bike on the side walk. The bus was driving the same path as me but I was on the driver-side side walk. I looked back and waved at the driver, during that time of riding my bike, I veer to the left and to the left was a house on the corner street. The house was lower than the sidewalk with no fence. And down I go towards his backyard. The sidelines of me falling down on top of the boulders of rocks along the wall to the ground. I flew face first. I was down, next thing I know I didn’t feel any pain, and I was floating up then I looked down seeing my body. I look back up and it starts getting black around me closing in and I started to see a light which was warm to me. I was stopped. I felt a presence, and something told me. It didn’t sound like a man or women but something both. It said, it wasn’t my time, go back. I said, 'okay.' 
  
Next thing I knew, I woke up taking my bike, blood running down my face, hurting in pain, and 3 houses up was where I lived. Heading up the hill I can see my mother talking to my aunt looking for me. All I said was, 'Mom' and I collapsed once again near the edge of the front lawn. I woke up not knowing the date or time. I had amnesia knowing who my family was and did not speak for 2 years. I heard from my brother the ambulance had to do an adrenaline shot. I still have the scar also for the tube down my throat.
