  		              		Experience Description   

    I had an asthma attack caused by unknown triggers. The attack came on very suddenly. I experienced a sense or an urgency that I needed to go to the hospital before I  began to feel symptoms. Within the fifteen or so minutes it took to get to the hospital, I was down to less than 40% lung function. They attempted to treat the asthma attack at the hospital. But after more than an hour of this procedure,  I was considered clinically dead. 
  
  I had an out of body experience where I could see the doctor and nurse working around my body on the table in the emergency room. I was conscious of the fact that they were injecting medications to try and restore lung function, since other medications had failed. But I couldn't feel anything they were doing. 
  
  Shortly after observing this, I felt the sensation of being lifted upwards. I found myself floating in a void.  I had a subconscious sensation of being in space above the Earth. The level of alertness I felt was beyond anything I have encountered. I was perfectly aware and more awake than I have ever been in life.  I also was aware of exactly what had happened during the asthma attack, going to the hospital, and seeing my own body. There wasn't any real positive or negative sensation involved. I had a feeling  of peace that any of the problems that I had been dealing with on Earth was finished.  I felt that I didn't need to worry about them, as though all of my affairs had been completed and taken care of exactly as they should have been. 
  
  As I floated in the void, I was also aware that I was not alone. There was another presence  with me. I didn't ask who or what they were, but I received a voiceless message from them telling me that they were my 'oldest friend.' He/they told me their  name was Heimdall.  I had never heard of that name before. He told me that I would always have what I  needed. They did not explain what that meant.  
  
  I remember asking, 'Am I dead?'

  Shortly after that, I awoke in the hospital. I had been dead for six minutes and unconscious for nearly a week. As a teenager, I was mostly angry because the nurse had botched my IV when putting it in. I did  not mentioned my experience to my family because they were extremely religious and I knew they wouldn't accept what had happened to me. 
  
  While I wasn't aware of receiving information during the encounter itself, I also woke with the knowledge that I had been shown a series of events that would happen in my future. Most of what I was shown was  almost immediately forgotten. As for the statement that I would always have what I need, that has proven true. I've had a lot of ups and downs in my life since the experience, but even under the most dire circumstances, I have always had food, shelter, medicine, and whatever else is necessary. Sometimes these things are made available to me through bizarre coincidences or circumstances.

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes   Illness.      Asthma.  Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function).   I had an asthma attack caused by unknown triggers. Within the fifteen or so minutes it took to get to the hospital, I was down to less than 40% lung function.

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Neither pleasant NOR distressing  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  I was able to see the hospital staff who were working on me in the emergency room. These events were verifiable because the marks on my body mirrored those of the treatments that were used (needles marks, adhesive from medical tape, etc.).  I lost awareness of my body  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I was more alert and aware than I had ever been in normal life.  
  
At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         During the entire NDE, especially after I had left the emergency room.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         No     

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Protestant     

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I converted from Christianity to paganism.  

What is your religion now?         Other or several faiths   Eclectic Pagan.  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I was raised in a heavily Christian household. My parents were missionaries. The experience itself was completely contrary to what had been taught, and subsequently led to a change in religious views.  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I changed religions and became interested in reincarnation.  

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   There was another presence with me who identified themselves as my 'oldest friend,' and gave the name Heimdall. I had never encountered the name before. Since then, I have come to believe that this person is someone I may have known in a past life.  
  
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I sensed their presence  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         Uncertain   The entity I encountered shares their name with the Norse deity Heimdall, but I do not believe they are the same individual.  

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     Knowledge of knowing the entity Heimdall. While that fact was known to me, most of the information I have recalled about him happened after the experience itself.  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     The entity Heimdall indicated that he was my 'oldest friend,' which I later came to learn was related to knowing him in a past life.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     Before my experience, I was Christian. I am now pagan, and have a strong interest in past life regressions and how reincarnation works within the framework of reality.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes Considering I was a teenager when it happened, I'd find it odd if my relationships hadn't changed in the time that has passed.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  As I am autistic, I have difficulties with memories of daily events, especially ones that are as old as my NDE. However, I remember every moment of the NDE with perfect clarity.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          No parts of the experience were more or less significant with others.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I've spoken about it periodically with friends, but have never had any significant responses to it.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I knew that it was a real experience as clearly as I know how much I like tea. That was never a question for me.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     My view has not changed.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   I was promised that I would never be without the things I need. That has proven true even under extraordinary circumstances, such as having a friend appear out of the blue when I greatly needed assistance or finding money that wasn't previously in a location I had already looked.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         No, I think I've covered it.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         N/A
