    （as told by Lee Shi’s grandnephew)  

  My fourth grandaunt was my grandmother's elder sister.  She never married for her entire life.  

It was during the Chinese government implementation of the land revolution policy around 1950.  She reported her nephew who had concealed weapons to agrarian reform officials.  Once the nephew found out that the whistleblower was his aunt, he searched for her everywhere.  When he found her, he shot her in the stomach with a gun. She bled badly and passed out. 

After she woke up, she told everybody what happened when she passed out. She said that she was in purgatory while she was collapsed. She reached to the edge of a bridge and saw houses on the other side of the bridge were very beautiful, much more prettier than the ones of her own and ours.  Before she approached towards the bridge for a tour，a guard by the bridge had stopped her. Two men came over to her saying fiercely, 'It is not your time yet, go back!'  Then she regained consciousness.
