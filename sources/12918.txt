  		              		Experience Description   

    I had bronchial asthma and was having so much difficulty breathing that I was rushed to hospital with my mother. Once there,  they injected me with the penicillin. 

  At that moment, I was up in a corner of the ceiling in the treatment room. I was watching my mum, the nurse, and a doctor urgently moving around my body that was slumped in a chair. I could see everything from different viewpoints within the room, but mostly from above. I watched and felt the urgency within the medical staff and the loving compassion and concern of my mother. I am not sure how long it lasted but it seemed like time ceased or paused while this was happening. I watched as a doctor came rushing in and injected me with a needle. Later, I found out it was adrenaline or something like that. As soon as I saw the doctor inject me in my thigh, I was back in my body but no longer had difficulty breathing. 

My mum was crying and relieved, as were the medical staff.
