    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Server, The.
 News Magazine of the Order of the Star in the East / Official Magazine for the Order of the Star in the East in America.
 1916--1927  Monthly
 Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA.  Publisher: Order of the Star in the East in America; Ojai Publishing Company.  Editor: Fritz Kunz, editor; Ernest Stone, manager; Marie Russak Hotchener.
  1/1, June 1916-1927.  20 pp., $1.00-$3.00 a year for non-members of the Order of the Star in the East in America; subscription included in membership dues of $2.00.

  This was yet another journal to promote Krishnamurti and the Order of the Star.  It contained addresses by J. Krishnamurti and articles by Annie Besant, Emily Lutyens, Marie Russak Hotchener, A.P. Warrington, Marjorie Tuttle, J.J. van der Leeuw, et al., all coupled with news of the progress of the order, and regular progressive articles and notices on parenting, social structure, temperance, dietetics, protection of animals, prison reform, child welfare,education, anti-vivisectionism, and other progressive ideas of the period, many of which seem strangely consonant with the offerings of progressivism today: "Rodeo Means -- Broken Necks Broken Legs Broken Horns, Choking and Strangling Little Calves -- the Animal Victims of This Commercialized Cruelty," etc.  National Library of Australia.
