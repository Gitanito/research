my name is Richard Haines I&#39;ve been a a
research scientist since the mid 1960s
in working in the field of Aeronautics
and Aero
I should say aerospace physiology and
vision and optics perception lighting
the Tama tree have worked on the Gemini
program for the space program worked on
the Apollo program the Skylab program on
several aeronautical programs and I
retired from Federal service in 1988 and
since then I have taught at a local
university
from a science point of view I can&#39;t
ignore the data the phenomena is just so
beautiful so powerful so curious that it
demands some scientific involvement and
I feel that the the pilot sightings are
very valuable because of a number of
factors the pilots are highly educated
and trained first for the first point
and what that means is that they have a
career at stake and they&#39;re not going to
come forward with a report of some
strange object or or light off the you
know side of the aircraft or near the
aircraft unless they&#39;ve already
eliminated all of the prosaic
explanations they&#39;re just risking their
career to do so and so that&#39;s the first
reason I like pilot cases another reason
is that they&#39;re flying aircraft that are
just packed with electromagnetic sensors
onboard of all kinds you see or
equipment that may be influenced by
eeehm radiation and so if we can find
some characteristic change in those
instruments or the radio or radar or the
direction finder or vor s or DME s or
various kinds of onboard cockpit
instruments we&#39;re learning something
about the nature of the radiation that&#39;s
we think related to the phenomena in
some way and of course that&#39;s what
science is about that science can get
interested in the phenomenon if it has
some good firm data to work with
in some cases jet interceptors Air Force
interceptors have been set up many cases
actually to help Oren to identify or
investigate the phenomenon but the pilot
might ask for radar coverage did you see
anything on radar and captain Daniels
story includes that very event did you
see anything on radar in Boston air
traffic control said no we don&#39;t see
anything but sometimes they do I have
many many cases in my air cat files
where there is good positive visual
radar correspondence I&#39;m asked quite
often to say something about air cat
it&#39;s these initials stand for air
catalogue this is a rather extensive
library I&#39;ve been collecting for almost
30 years now from commercial military
private and test pilots I have over
3,000 cases now a certain proportion are
certainly historical that I&#39;ve not
interviewed myself because I in some of
them they&#39;re so old I wasn&#39;t even alive
it wasn&#39;t born yet and many of them come
from Project Blue Book which is the
official Air Force study of the subject
but many of the more recent ones I have
investigated and have tape recordings or
video recordings of the interviews with
the pilots I have FAA tapes that you can
obtain as a citizen through Freedom of
Information Act requests and so this
database is very large and those cases
that are not complete are usually the
result of or what I would say a
hesitancy on the part of the pilot to
disclose everything if their commercial
pilot for instance
there may be concerns about job security
or ridicule some you know reasonable
I shouldn&#39;t say reasonable but
understandable reasons why they
I&#39;ll say in half of the cases at least
the phenomenon appears to approach the
airplane not the other way around it&#39;s
as if the aircraft is the focus of
attention or curiosity if I may use that
word of the phenomenon that the pilots
flying along minding his own business
and something comes up alongside one
wing for 15 minutes at cruise altitude
true speed and then sometimes will flip
over to the other wing or stay right at
the nose of the aircraft and then do
barrel rolls along the flight axis some
very interesting maneuvers the kind of
flight maneuvers that our aircraft are
generally not capable of doing here&#39;s an
interesting case involving magnetic
compass deviation it took place on May
26 1979 at about midnight over south
central Utah and this is a private
aircraft James gala guard left Blackfoot
Idaho before midnight and it was now at
10,000 feet altitude in his light
aircraft
he was just no south of the shallows
National Forest intent upon landing at
Friedman Memorial Airport at Haley and
Idaho about 14 miles south of Sun Valley
in his own words quote I looked up in
front of me and saw these five orange
objects in a horizontal formation in
front of me and then they tilted like an
aircraft would dip its wings and I
thought it was lights on an aircraft of
some kind then they spread out and I
knew damn well it wasn&#39;t an aircraft
unquote at one point the object
regrouped and formed a vertical line
then they moved around randomly
apparently coming closer to me then all
five came to the left side of my
aircraft quote my magnetic compass
started spinning in my automatic
direction finder started spinning at
that point they were in a straight line
formation and then they just blinked out
I did have trouble receiving on the
radio because of heavy static
my engine started running rough unquote
it&#39;s also of interest to note that a
Braniff flight crew also reported seeing
orange objects below their altitude the
same morning while flying at 35,000 feet
altitude only 120 miles south of
Gallagher&#39;s sighting and again at 253
after midnight a.m. when they were some
70 miles northwest of Ogden Utah ground
radar also tracked the objects during
this encounter so there we have an
interesting case of several aircraft
compasses deviating radio frequency
interference and radar there&#39;s a wealth
of data there and it just amazes me that
my colleagues in the physical sciences
just for some reason aren&#39;t interested
in this subject
recently I went through all of my
thousands of pilot reports and I was
looking in that review just for American
aircraft registered aircraft and within
that subset not foreign but American
what number of reports could I find that
seemed to impact aviation safety
I found a hundred cases that I felt had
some important impact where flight
safety was impaired or reduced in some
way now in the process of doing that I
reviewed I had to read all the foreign
cases as well and I was blown away by
the similarity of Close Encounters of
American and foreign aircraft flight
crews let&#39;s say it suggests that the
phenomenon is worldwide of obviously we
take that for granted now it&#39;s not
showing up differently by culture for
instance that the behavior of the
phenomenon near an aircraft is the same
for foreign aircraft as it is American
aircraft as I would expect so we start
raising questions about intelligence is
there some intelligent guidance behind
the phenomenon well that&#39;s a scientific
question that&#39;s a valuable scientific
question and to me where I am right now
in the data analysis I think there is
I&#39;m gaining more and more data to make
this case that there is a high degree of
intelligence and control behind this
phenomena but when I look historically
back at the data from 50 years ago well
I know something about Aero space
technology from from the space program
at least I don&#39;t know about the military
work because that&#39;s been highly
classified but from the last 50 years or
so of automation I could say that at
least in the the non-black programs we
could not do what these objects were
reported is doing
and so that says that if it&#39;s
intelligent it&#39;s probably not human
intelligence to me intelligence is
generally shown by non-random kinds of
events regular events for instance and
my book called Project Delta is an
analysis of multiple objects seen either
from the ground or the air
there are many pilot cases there but
when I look carefully at the flight
dynamics the the flight formations that
multiple objects seem to to display next
to a pilot I have to say that they are
precisely guided that they know where
they are in three-dimensional space at
any moment they know where their
neighbors are in three-dimensional space
they seem to be able to communicate so
that they all execute manoeuvres
simultaneously not like the Navy Blue
Angels that take a little you know a
fraction of a second before the reaction
time sets in they&#39;d like to be and they
would like to be simultaneous but
they&#39;re they&#39;re really not there&#39;s a
time lag there but another illustration
of intelligence and this can be disputed
this can be debated I understand
I had a b-52 captain tell me once that
he was flying in the front left seat of
a brand-new b-52 from Wichita Kansas
where it was made by the Boeing
Corporation and his job was to ferry
that aircraft with a light crew not a
full crew to an Air Force Base in the
southwestern part of America clear sunny
day beautiful bright sky and an object a
round sphere probably four or five feet
in diameter with no markings no rivets
no seams no insignias no USAF on the
side showed up right off his left wing
tip well his copilot said captain we
have an object off our right wing tip
and he described and it was the same
shape size and every identical to the
on the left wing so there&#39;s two objects
now keeping up with the aircraft at
cruise altitude and cruise speed well to
make a long story short he told me that
an object showed up behind the aircraft
above the aircraft below the aircraft
and off each wingtip five total and I
said well what did you do he said well I
hit the autopilot button on the control
column and went into evasive maneuvers
which is kind of standard operating
procedure to try to shake these things
and he said I tried to if they were
balloons they weren&#39;t going to keep up
with us very long if they were birds why
were they at that altitude and flying at
three or four hundred miles an hour so
forth and so on
good typical piloting behavior checking
off what they weren&#39;t you see well he
said no matter what I did with that
aircraft they were stayed with the
aircraft perfectly aligned
they was called station-keeping so he
said after a while of this we&#39;re running
out of fuel and I have a job to do he
said he added power got back up to
cruise altitude and put it on back on
autopilot and he said after 15 or so
minutes more the objects departed from
the aircraft in the exact opposite order
they arrived intelligence to me that&#39;s
that&#39;s not random
that&#39;s intelligence that&#39;s deliberate I
can say happily that we don&#39;t know of
any major cases where deaths have
occurred from UAP the reason for that is
very interesting that there have not
been any collisions that we know of with
commercial flights from UAP why because
the phenomenon seems to get out of the
way in time highly maneuverable great
deal of energy to deal with and enter
flying in airplanes fundamentally
manipulating energy from one form to
another
thrust-vectoring is another way of
thinking about that well now think about
that for a moment that if this
phenomenon is so maneuverable that it
can avoid a collision at the last minute
and this technical report has scores of
cases like that zipping over the top of
the aircraft just at the last moment
pilot doesn&#39;t do anything that says
something about intelligence doesn&#39;t it
it&#39;s in just technology at least it
suggests a an understanding of energy
management that I don&#39;t think we have
now the skeptics some skeptics will say
that these are all visual illusions and
I can&#39;t buy that not all these cases not
with three sets of eyeballs in that
cockpit and not with radar confirmation
not with ground confirmation by radar or
even additional aircraft nearby pilots
being human beings are subject to the
same pressure psychological pressures as
anyone is in our culture against
reporting these strange experiences
these strange phenomena that shouldn&#39;t
exist the authorities tell us there&#39;s no
threat they tell us that there&#39;s nothing
to worry about that there&#39;s really
nothing there so why report something
that&#39;s not really there you see so
pilots being professionals to have
careers at stake and so it&#39;s easier not
to report them so they don&#39;t report them
now we don&#39;t know how many are not
reported all we know is the number that
are reported obviously but my estimate
is that for every one pilot who does
come forward and makes a confidential or
a public report I would estimate there&#39;s
2030 other pilots who don&#39;t as a result
of this review of my air cat files I
found a number of cases back in the 60s
for instance when the Air Force was
still heavily involved in this subject
where they stepped in and interrogated
interviewed let&#39;s use the word
commercial pilots not just their own
military pilots but commercial pilots
and ended the interview by saying you&#39;re
not to tell anybody about what you saw
captain ken tjuta Ruchi was piloting a
Boeing 747 Japan Airlines from Paris
France to Tokyo over the polar route and
I interviewed him by phone I&#39;ve been the
only civilian to interview this
gentleman after he and his crew had a
major sighting over northern Alaska on
their way to Anchorage to land for
refueling
and as a result of his following the
rules which he did making a report out
landing safely delivering the cargo
being a good pilot Japan Airlines asked
him to not fly anymore and I happened to
meet the chief medical officer for Japan
Airlines on that incident and I asked
him why why did you relieve captain
Terauchi from his flying duties flying a
desk right and his answer was well we
convened a medical review board on this
incident and we decided that it was not
wise for Japan Airlines to have a pilot
flying who sees such strange things and
that was the answer given so captain
suruci was then
not demoted I guess you&#39;d say but at
least in that culture that&#39;s hard on ego
on self-image on pride very hard and so
I have to tell you the end of the story
and it was that I may have said too much
to this Japanese gentleman in a
three-piece suit in Japan Airlines but I
said well I have to disagree with you
sir I think you have a fine pilot there
captain suruci is a very fine pilot he
did follow the instructions he did
report accurately he did maintain
control of that aircraft at all times he
did deliver his cargo and he was not the
only pilot that I know of that has seen
such strange things as that very large
objects for instance this was a huge
object near his aircraft and he said
well that&#39;s very interesting
would you like to submit any information
in his behalf I said I&#39;d be delighted so
I came home and put together a packet
about two inches thick where I said all
this in writing and appended examples
from my files of similar cases to show
that captain Terauchi was not the only
person who&#39;s ever had an experience like
this and I sent it off to Tokyo never
heard another thing for about oh I don&#39;t
know maybe six eight months maybe even a
year I don&#39;t remember now and I learned
later
that he was reinstated to flying status
so he&#39;s now flying again
happy to say there are very often
multicolored lights on these objects
daytime and night well why do you need
lights on in the daytime you see as
collision avoidance perhaps not with a
reflecting surface the lights are not
FAA approved very often they&#39;re blue
lights and that&#39;s not an approved air
aircraft color you see so something else
is going on the lights are often
sequenced on and off on and off in some
regular pattern they would be rotating
clockwise around the circumference for
instance aircraft don&#39;t have that when
we look at daylight sightings of UFO
phenomenon in general there is probably
more commonality than difference I&#39;ll
have to say that for instance they the
great majority of the phenomena reflect
ambient light what that means is it&#39;s
like a bumper of a car that&#39;s polished
chrome and it reflects sunlight you see
a little image of the Sun well that&#39;s
the kind of surface characteristics of
the objects almost always have not
always but usually another
classification of surface
characteristics is pitch black almost a
black hole where it&#39;s absorbing light
for instance during the daytime the
great majority of these objects seem to
reflect light just like a solid surface
would just like a chrome bumper of a car
would reflect sunlight for instance
however very seldom do we see seams
markings rivets any sort of insignias
there&#39;s almost none that these are just
smooth arid aeronautical II shaped very
seldom do we find sharp edges they&#39;re
usually smooth rounded edges quite often
there&#39;s a little protrusion either on
the top or the bottom or both that some
people describe as a cupola or a cockpit
of some sort and very often they&#39;re
transparent and detail can be seen
inside the windows very interesting I
have a number of cases where the object
or whatever it is let&#39;s call it an
object does not reflect light but it&#39;s
pitch black
that it&#39;s a like a black hole it almost
absorbs light typically they have sharp
edges they&#39;re not fuzzy edges which
suggests a physical object there as
opposed to an atmospheric an optical
phenomenon in one case in particular
comes to mind and this is a Canadian
pilot flying by himself in a two engine
propeller cargo aircraft a dc-3 and he&#39;s
flying about sundown to the south after
having dropped off an oil crew at a
little strip north of Canada
Saskatchewan I think it was and he&#39;s
flying about 5,000 feet altitude about
ready to land and his wife is down there
has a coffee on and at the radio on and
he radios to her that hey honey I&#39;m
going to be home in 20 minutes get the
coffee going and I&#39;m hungry and he said
to me that off to the western horizon
the son is about on the horizon ready to
go down he noticed a black speck
and at that great distance off to his
right he thought it was another aircraft
so he kept an eye on it he just keeps on
going straight ahead obviously he said
this object whatever it was was at his
altitude and moving rather quickly from
right to left until it was pretty much
right ahead of him and then he said it
stopped it came to an abrupt halt right
in front of his aircraft and he started
to gain the distance was lessening and
it got bigger and bigger and bigger I
said well what did it look like he said
it looked like a bullet it was flat on
its rear end pointed on its front and
kind of parallel at the top and then it
tapered down to the to the point on the
front well what did you do he said
nothing I could do it was just there in
front of me and then it maintained
distance it just kept a constant
distance it didn&#39;t change in size in
other words
so we&#39;re equating size of the object
with separation distance and what
happened I said well after some minutes
it just continued on its way in its
original direction end of story
almost he radioed his wife to describe
what had happened he found out that they
had lost so she&#39;d lost some time some
time had passed
longer than should have normally from
where he was to worry should be going
to land the aircraft and I suspect when
the object was right ahead
that&#39;s when the tug missing time
occurred and for a pilot to look you in
the eye and tell you that you know at a
hundred yards distance at altitude that
has a great emotional impact on me I
must say
you
