 &nbsp; &nbsp;     Periodical:  The Seer and Celestial Reformer</I>      

      Summary:  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Seer and Celestial Reformer, The.
 1884--1884  Monthly
 Kingsley, by Frodsham, Cheshire, England. 
 Publisher: J. Thomas, F.T.S.; Printed and Published for the Proprietor by J.J. Morse. 
 Editor: John Thomas (1826-1908). 
 Succeeded by: The Occultist
  1/1, July 1884-December 1884.  1s. 6d. a year; one penny a copy.  4 pp., 11 x 14.

 	  Remittances and letters to the editor were to be sent in care of J.J. Morse in London, and the journal recited that it was "Printed and Published for the Proprietor by J.J. Morse," so Morse, a medium who had been involved over the years with a half dozen spiritualist journals, may have had a hand in Thomas's more occult endeavors as well.  The appearance of the magazine coincided with the first notice of Thomas's British and Foreign Society of Occultists, the "Celestial Brotherhood," to whose liberality the journal owed its existence and whose esoteric and exoteric principles it claimed to expound.  The founder of this group (which included at various times Alan Leo, John Yarker and Francis George Irwin) was the Welsh astrologer, seer, Mesmerist, herbalist and medium, John Thomas.  See Robert A. Gilbert, "The Disappointed Magus: John Thomas and His â€˜Celestial Brotherhood,'" Theosophical History 8/3 (July 2000), 98-111.  University of London, Warburg.
