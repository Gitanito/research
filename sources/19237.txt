hello I&#39;m a dr. Steven Greer founder of
the disclosure project and the creator
of the film serious and I&#39;d like to make
a wonderful announcement that all of you
have been waiting for the film serious
which went to one of the most watched
and top picks on Netflix in the past
year and has been seen by millions of
people around the world we are now
releasing on our YouTube channel which
is youtube.com slash s disclosure in its
entirety and it can be seen for free and
we&#39;re doing this because we want the
public to see the last crowdfunded film
we did and we&#39;ll have that as a
foundation for education for anyone who
wants to see it but also to introduce
the next film and that is this
documentary feature film called
unacknowledged and expose of the
greatest secret in human history and it
will have a book that goes with the film
and will be launched with a massive
disclosure event and celebration and
concert we want everyone to be able to
see this film but we would also like if
you can to contribute to the
crowdfunding campaign million
contributing your network and networking
with friends and other organizations but
also how you can contribute even if it&#39;s
just a few dollars to this campaign so
that we have enough resources to do this
next project which will is a campaign
that ends illegal secrecy on UFOs and
free energy once and for all that it&#39;s
not just this one film and book that is
going to be supported but a whole
initiative that goes on into the future
so enjoy the movie serious many of you
have seen it many have not and I hope
that you can also support us in this
next project unacknowledged thank you
very much
you
most people don&#39;t know what a dead man&#39;s
trigger is and even fewer need one dead
man&#39;s triggers a safety valve the
reasons of security a person prepares a
recourse of such severe action that if
harmed they will release the cachet of
damaging evidence against those enemies
given his situation dr. Steven Greer is
one of those rare men
why would he need one he&#39;s not the first
person to push the disclosure of a
corrupt military-industrial agenda in
the council&#39;s of government we must car
guard against the acquisition of
unwarranted influence whether sought or
unsought by the military-industrial
complex in his final public speech a
farewell address knoweth in a time when
every second on TV was priceless United
States President Dwight D Eisenhower
decided not to brag about his victory in
the Korean War
instead he cashed in all his chips to
warn this nation of a hidden enemy we
have been compelled to create a
permanent armaments industry of vast
proportions the total influence economic
political even spiritual is felt in
every city every state house every
office of the federal government we
recognize the imperative need for this
development yet we must not fail to
comprehend its grave implications when I
was with Lawrence Rockefeller at his
ranch in 1993 he turned to me and he
said the implications of this are so
vast and so profound that no aspect of
life on earth will be unchanged by its
disclosure I say yes Lawrence that&#39;s why
it&#39;s been kept secret it&#39;s not because
it&#39;s trivial it&#39;s because the
implications are so profound so there
have been attempts to bring this
information out for over 60 years and
here we sit in 2012 with the world still
burning oil and gas and coal when we
have had technologies sciences and all
the information we need to have had in
completely new civilization
what Eisenhower warned us about over
sixty years ago according to Steve Greer
has long become truth in Washington DC
and why is Washington DC booming because
the rest of the country is sending their
money here I know in a beautiful through
the trees my name is Ted Lauder I&#39;ve
been working with C SETI program and dr.
Greer for 15 years huh yeah what one
always wonders if that if the public
really knew what was going on with
government covert programs and how much
money has been put into it you know
hundreds of billions of dollars I think
the public would be a little annoyed
Thomas Jefferson believed all men have
the right to life liberty than the
pursuit of happiness the government they
formed would serve to secure those
rights but when corporations or other
specialized groups of men become more
powerful than those who govern our
security is at stake
Thomas Jefferson wrote about unchecked
power of the corporation being a threat
to the democracy of banks and the banks
you see the US Federal Reserve Bank
issues every dollar bill yet it is not
run by the US government or any elected
official his own by a private banking
cartel but here I find a chairman of the
Federal Reserve who&#39;s in charge of the
dollars in charge of the money in charge
of what the money supply is going to be
the middle class is being wiped out and
nobody&#39;s understanding that it has to do
with the value of money prices are going
up so how are you able to defend this
policy of deliberate depreciation of our
money part a lot of it depends on what
happens to the price of oil the four
horsemen or families of banking who own
and run the Federal Reserve also run the
four largest oil companies oil is also
used to make and run machinery and
current mechanical technology of course
there&#39;s one industry that needs these
more than anyone else the
military-industrial complex you begin to
get into this very scary scenario that
has to do with the human condition the
proclivity to accumulate vast amounts of
power around a handful of people
alright sit down and shut up
and right now these misanthropic
sociopaths are running the planet into
the ground when when Congress or
whatever else their budget directors say
well the the you know we&#39;ve lost a
hundred billion dollars in black program
what is the public do what can the
public do we can complain to our
congressmen but our congressmen can&#39;t
get any information with lobbyists
interest groups campaign funding the
economic powers that be have learned to
control the political sphere these
politicians become almost like
placeholders and they don&#39;t realize that
until they get into the White House or
into the Senate Intelligence Committee
it doesn&#39;t matter who the president is
they&#39;re gonna do what they want to do
and that which is good for them isn&#39;t
always good for everybody else
from 1945 to 1998 2053 nuclear bombs
exploded along this planet the United
States detonated over half of them now I
am become death the destroyer of worlds
when the first nuclear bomb was exploded
in Trinity Robert Oppenheimer one of the
founding fathers of the nuclear age said
we have done this before
it could have been that Oppenheimer was
speaking about weapons described in the
ancient Sanskrit texts like the
Mahabharata in which they refer to a
bolt of iron charged with the light of a
thousand suns this bolt of iron was
hurled in anger and led to an explosive
event which is very graphically
described in this religious scripture
specifically showing all the key
indications of radiation sickness and
the various problems with nuclear
weaponry that we&#39;ve come to expect
we started detonating thermonuclear
weapons atomic weapons and developing
these sort of destructive technologies
the civilizations that have been
watching this planet for millennia said
oh my god
these people are going way off the
reservation they are now an existential
threat to themselves but also to other
planets potentially all over the world
we see very conclusive evidence that
ancient people were in contact with
extraterrestrial life
the Japanese said that their
civilization was given to them by a
people they called the Dogu who came
from what they described as on a mon
alto de una which translates as bird
boat universe meaning flying boats from
the universe the ancient Sanskrit
writings of India have elaborate
descriptions of be bottles or flying
craft these texts are thousands of years
old they predate any conception that we
have of spacecraft or aircraft but
evidence is not just found in ancient
texts it is also captured in our
ancestors art as if it was plainly
obvious that et vehicles appeared in
agents guys
it is a foregone conclusion my most
broad-minded people then we are not
alone in this universe the question is
how close are they we all looked at it
once it was almost like in an
intelligence told us hey look over here
we&#39;re here
so if you had lights and a triangle
almost exactly overhead
I saw these things I ran inside and got
my brothers and sister
and it actually lifted up in a
catastrophe turn
I wasn&#39;t one who believed the universe
might exist I receptors vibration see
they estimated a hundred yards from the
left wings was this hundred-foot this
me
a lot of the astronauts are told keep it
quiet and they&#39;re good Americans too
they developed the film from the moon
everything that&#39;s done by NASA
because sin asanam called it after super
yo
there&#39;s so much evidence out there that
even if less than 1% is true that would
be enough to collapse the current
paradigm and change the whole planet
this is our signature tones that we
broadcast over small walkie talkie they
were recorded in the crop circle what
happens is the extraterrestrials they
come into the area where we we vector
them in with this signature tones that
we broadcast then it enables them to
home in and get a a real good fix on
where the site is where we&#39;re all kamal
we&#39;re set now
the whole concepts of the crossing point
of light the physics of consciousness
and interstellar communication all were
developed on a kind of Vision Quest we
did here in 95 or 96 astronomer J Allen
Hynek developed the scale to identify
the types of human he encounters from
his original three categories a fourth
more controversial has been added ce4
even more controversial Steven Greer
added a fifth kind of encounter ce-5
human initiated contact so how is this
done given Schrodinger&#39;s idea that the
number of all minds in the universe is
one in order to make this type of
contact a human could potentially access
that single inner consciousness through
intense meditation and then visualize
his location down through the Milky Way
to the planet earth to wherever he sits
under the stars in the theory than any
extraterrestrial passing by would be
able to hear the broadcast and know
exactly where to go if they choose to do
so it&#39;s interesting how many people have
never been out in a place like this
where they can see the whole Milky Way
galaxy most people who come for a week
it&#39;s alters their life
there&#39;s meditation techniques there&#39;s
remote viewing techniques and once you
start learning these processes and
refining them then you can make contact
more quickly more easily and be more of
an asset to the group checking to be
sure that there&#39;s no source from anyone
else so that when we do start having
electromagnetic signals through this we
know that it&#39;s a legitimate source
my name is Emery Smith I&#39;ve been with Si
studying for approximately three years
getting the baseline reading from us my
duties consist of a couple things I&#39;m
doctor bear&#39;s head security detail I
also am their photographer I operate
anywhere from two to six cameras at one
time many of the craft that are coming
in or transdimensional and the way I
understand it not visible to the human
eye and that&#39;s where this new technology
the night vision that&#39;s where that&#39;s
coming into play in with the advent of
new technology that&#39;s out there it
becomes easier and easier for us to
capture these beings and these celestial
objects on film after you do the night
vision it has that green hue of course
and after a while when you get back to
real life you&#39;re thinking why doesn&#39;t
everything green this can&#39;t be reality I
want to show an early one from Gulf
Breeze from 1992 we went down there and
one of the fun things that happened is
that I had about 40 50 people let&#39;s go
out on the beach and we didn&#39;t have good
cameras then but you&#39;ll get the feeling
of how exciting it was have all these
people and one and then two and then
three and then four
et craft materialized right in the sky
the point the point is is fun
it&#39;s your responsibility to go into
meditation find a little bit of time 10
15 minutes and remote-view who&#39;s up
there and how many I can attest to the
fact that real phenomenon happens here I
really feel that his ce-5 protocols are
based on a spiritual kind of positive
contact and I think that that is an
excellent model for any kind of
communication whether it be on earth if
the United Nations or wherever but in
this particular field is with cosmic
cultures and we use consciousness
meditation visualization remote viewing
certain tones and we do it in a group
when we can or even as individuals it&#39;s
just it&#39;s just been this series of
unbelievable events that are amplified
by by our meditation it enforces this
communication between us and the ETS and
it&#39;s it&#39;s so interactive
let&#39;s do it let&#39;s do it we can&#39;t you
feel as if it would feel that this is
perfectly normal
you know this is relaxed and getting
that flow of consciousness exactly I was
jarred by our group getting like tripped
out and in that kind of like it I was
startled by some of the ways that our
group or it was being and I was going
and then there&#39;s Mo&#39;s where I was like
wow I can only imagine a visitor the ETS
picked up on your intentions and if
you&#39;re really out there just to learn
and really want to communicate with
these extraterrestrials well it&#39;s going
to happen in cha cha yes Chicago go be
the yogi and we asked these
extraterrestrial civilizations to join
us as they begin to learn of us to help
us to understand us even as we endeavor
to understand them and welcome them here
to this beautiful planet
oh here comes the military playing very
quickly yeah - they&#39;re very fast
military
oh it turned right through it yeah
literally my heart literally sunk when
that with my jet on a jet you know got
to where where the crap had to had to
phase out yeah I liked it to feel all
that love build and then to feel that
jet coming in and it was on a heart
lovely my heart literally song yeah Jack
across the path
so the camera that Sergey got you got
like this light family traveling
traveling traveling you can see it&#39;s not
like the sunlight where it&#39;s got like a
path it&#39;s got and then it&#39;s gone
when I was 17 I injured myself that got
so infected and at the time because I
was very poor and I didn&#39;t have any
health care I just laid there and I got
sicker and sicker and sicker and I had a
near-death experience
I found myself out in deep space and it
was this experience of complete oneness
with the cosmos not just with earth and
life on Earth but with the Stars and the
infinity of creation
it certainly altered the course of what
I would end up doing because I then
learned meditation I actually became
very aware of the power of the mind
this experience helped guide the
direction of his life though greer went
on to earn a medical degree and raise a
family
continued to study consciousness and
contact and decades later it seems he
would be the doctor called upon first to
examine the very unusual body this came
to us in the last couple of years and
there was a man who runs an institute in
another country that i cannot talk about
but he came into possession of a little
creature it is humanoid it does not look
human we have acquired an EBE and
extraterrestrial biological entity we&#39;re
flying over to europe soon to take some
tissue samples and do some DNA testing
this was found in the Atacama Desert we
don&#39;t know how it came about here&#39;s the
great view of the face and cheek bone
very complex now there is a fracture
here and behind this right ear is caved
in and that&#39;s how how this this this ET
beam was killed we have the best
scientists in the u.s. from stanford
that were going to be doing the testing
itself to see what this really is and
also to rule out what it&#39;s not
the initial reaction that I had is the
same reaction that many of my colleagues
here at Stanford and elsewhere have had
when I&#39;ve shown them is it Wow
what is this the question is important
enough in at least two ways the primary
reason is that there&#39;s a lot of claims
about specimens and claims about aliens
and of course there&#39;s a lot of ridicule
associated with that so one of the best
things that we should be doing of course
then is bringing the best scientific
techniques to bear the techniques are
available the techniques are cheap the
answers are nearly absolute so let&#39;s do
it in setting up for this I&#39;m gonna be
giving Steve not only the tubes that
this should be going into but I&#39;m also
going to be sending across the
microscope that I feel they should be
using to do the analysis with before we
even get started with some of the
analysis I think it&#39;s going to be
important to rule out some of the
obvious critiques that could come up and
one of those critiques is that this is a
syndrome or a mutation this is a bone
dysplasia and luckily here at Stanford
we happen to have literally the world&#39;s
expert the man who wrote the book on
bone dysplasias and syndromes gentleman
by the name of dr. Ralph Lachlan who has
kindly agreed to look at the specimen
both pictures as well as the CT scans
and the x-rays to help determine whether
or not it&#39;s anything that he&#39;s ever seen
before I think that a dozen or even 15
years ago answering the question of what
is this would really not have been
possible because the kinds of
technologies were not available as are
available today but really the DNA tells
the story and because we have the
computational techniques that allows us
to determine in very short order whether
in fact this is human so this will be
basically an absolute level of proof
as to what this actually is
the problem is not proving that UFOs
exists it&#39;s when you begin to expose the
energy and propulsion systems behind how
they&#39;re getting here you&#39;re talking
about unveiling an entirely new science
that would replace oil gas coal nuclear
power public utilities and this is the
six hundred trillion dollar problem the
Patent Office after they fired me I had
to wait six years before I got rehired
everybody at the office was avoiding the
case but when they finally did the
arbitrator wrote an 80 85 page report on
how the media had caused my dismissal so
I only got a 30-day suspension of the
whole thing which was taken out of the
tiny little bit of 6-year back pay so
that was great yeah it was it made it
all worth it so to speak because that&#39;s
how we were able to open the offices and
stuff it was very comfortable no feeling
of being shocked or anything else just
to you know a good feeling uncomfortable
what scientists need to do and normal
people need to do is they need to look
at the hardcore evidence decide that oh
my gosh ETS are real and then get over
that and if that&#39;s the case then you can
start extrapolating because they&#39;re
getting here which means they have
solved the physics problem if you will
that&#39;s an actual photograph that mark
Whitford took friend of mine and you see
the stars in the background so this is a
fixed camera the craft was a triangular
craft moving away from him and all of a
sudden it makes it right hanging with
her apparently it has what I would
describe as an inertial shielding it&#39;s
the only way something can make a right
angle turn without having everybody
killed inside of the craft though we
experience inertial forces every day
their origins remain a mystery however
there are theories that point to
interactions between objects with mass
and a quantum energy field the inertia
is due to the zero-point energy
interaction you&#39;re interacting with a
charged matrix which is a zero-point
field you try to change that then you
get a reaction
there must be an interference shield of
electromagnetic nature that would stop
the interaction what is your point field
and you can suspect that UFOs have
already figured this out because they
wouldn&#39;t be flying around and still have
an ambulance
new energy scientists today are
attempting to find new ways to define
the relationship between electricity
gravity magnetism and propulsion but as
history has shown change does not always
come easy
it&#39;s like Newton&#39;s why is that Apple
falling nobody ever asked that question
before or even tried to come up with an
answer and Newton comes up with
something called Newton bucket or a
Newton&#39;s problem the only guy that
solves it 300 years later is Einstein so
you know how smart can we be if you look
at everything normal within the
conventional wisdom you&#39;re not gonna
learn anything new my name is Morgan
Boardman I am the chief financial
officer of Morningstar Applied Physics
my business partners are Paul Murad and
dr. John Brandenburg what we&#39;re doing
like I said earlier is we&#39;re using a
magnet magnetic field that&#39;s rotating
about the axis with the hope of
generating a magnetic vortex in essence
we are trying to start a civilian
Advanced Research Projects Agency
okay alright so basically we have four
options option one is a [ __ ]
potential option two is a lagging and
edge right option three is pointing
vector as a motive for propulsion or
however that may be what&#39;s happening
right
yeah and that&#39;s actually check taking of
angular momentum and changing it into
linear momentum if it&#39;s working the way
we wanted to right okay
and then the fourth one the fourth one
is that we are somehow either generating
and/or absorbing gravity waves do we
accept Einsteins viewpoint that thou
shalt not go faster than the speed of
light if you look at a black hole the
comment is the gravity is so strong then
nothing leaves but it does have
something to eat that leaves a black
hole and that is gravity so does that
imply that gravity moves fast in the
speed of light would be gravity is
another one of those seemingly
self-evident forces that has raised a
number of questions how does it really
work
how can we use it to our advantage in
the mid-1920s t Townsend Brown
discovered that electric charge and
gravitational mass are coupled and that
by building devices that harness these
interactive forces we could create
advanced propulsion at about the same
time Nikolai Tesla and Thomas Edison won
the Nobel Prize in Physics but both
refused it Tesla was at the end of a
long career of inventing he had advanced
technology in the fields of x-ray radio
waves internal combustion and of course
atmospheric electricity and everything&#39;s
said and done he had earned 112 US
patents he proved that electricity can
travel wirelessly in the air and
ultimately died penniless however his
work did influence many others most
notably Lester Hendershot and dr. T
Henry Moray Hendershot invented a
magnetronic generator to energize an
impossible flight if fueled by gas that
took Charles Lindbergh in the spirit of
st. Louis from New York to Paris dr. T
Henry Moray developed the more a vowel a
device for extracting radiant energy
from the zero-point field and
demonstrated this device hundreds of
times and had dozens of signed
affidavits supporting his science yet in
the end even these two notable
scientists were ignored and bullied dr.
morays device was hammered down and
broken into pieces by a competitor and
before he could finish reconstruction he
passed away
causes undershot fled to Mexico to
continue work but was found dead at 61
years of age attributed to suicide
there&#39;s all kinds of skullduggery that
happened there
I don&#39;t think TN r amore ever got a
decent chance to ever do anything with
that there is absolutely no question
that T Henry Moray had a system that
produced 50 about 50 kilowatts out of a
55 pound box
the conventional electrodynamics model
does not allow this to happen in other
words it doesn&#39;t allow you to extract
excess energy from the vacuum and use
that to power your loads it costs just
as much to restore it as was used to
destroy it so we got to put in more than
we can ever get out in a load with such
a squirrely circuit and that&#39;s the only
kind of circuit we&#39;ve used in power
systems since day one we&#39;re still
building them we&#39;re still making power
systems that deliberately kill them so
we pay the power company they have a
giant wrestling match inside his
generator Lou&#39;s in the 1950s there were
some very provocative articles saying
that electrogravitics is the best thing
since sliced bread how all the aviation
companies are now backing
electrogravitics they&#39;re all doing
experiments on it well within a couple
of years there was no news at all once
they figured out that they could really
control gravity 1954 it all went black
do you think the boys and the black
projects have solved that problem
because it sure sounds like it from what
the witnesses have told me I wouldn&#39;t
know
I wouldn&#39;t know sorry but I can can&#39;t
even think about it
I see so many things in my life it&#39;s
just hard to say what Stan shared with
me was interesting in order to run this
engine off of water we&#39;ve also had to
learn the ability to adjust the burn
rate of hydrogen the co eco the fossil
fuels so he plans for a patent and then
he gets a call from actually a
visitation by two guys from the Pentagon
last week to look at Mars and vision
there&#39;s talk of possibly using it in the
Star Wars defense program and to one our
meetings but he asked that this become
public patent so that the civilians
could benefit from it and he indicated
that if we don&#39;t do that overseas people
will in 1996 Meyer was sued by his
investors the claim the device was not
revolutionary
despite verification of the unique
voltage intensifier circuit by the US
Patent Office Meyer was brought to trial
but key evidence was not allowed his
oral testimony was not even recorded due
to an audio recorder malfunction and the
judge recessed early for vacation later
Meyer made an appeal it was denied he
was found guilty of fraud in order to
repay his investors putting an immediate
dent on the idea of funding new
technology on March 20th 1998
Stanley joined his brother and two NATO
officials for dinner meeting Stan took a
sip of cranberry juice he grabbed his
neck ran out of the restaurant and fell
to the ground saying they poisoned me he
fell down after eating at a restaurant
nearby where he lived fell down the
parking lot said I have been poisoned
collapsed and that&#39;s how the police
report the police report confirms his
words the cause of death was written to
be an aneurysm though he left behind
just enough materials for others to
piece together his process the full
secrets of his device died with him
so from this I began to do more work
with administration various people
friends of the president the Rockefeller
family the Lawrence was the white hat in
that crowd who wanted us to bring this
information out I actually hosted us at
the Rockefeller ranch and the Tetons one
night he pulled me out on on the deck
and he said well you know we really need
you to do this
I said Lawrence you&#39;re old you&#39;re rich
and you&#39;re rockefeller what do you want
me to do I&#39;m just a country doctor
banging around in an ER in North
Carolina says no no we want you to do
this I want okay so I&#39;m the throw away
guy I&#39;m the guy you can throw away
because I my life doesn&#39;t matter
we are back in Rachel Nevada with our
first two distinguished guests Steven
Greer is a North Carolina doctor he does
a lot more than watch the skies he fires
off messages and he says that someone or
something is responding dr. Greer is
looking for Close Encounters of the
fifth kind what at this minute do you
believe our assessment at this point is
that there is at least one
extraterrestrial civilization which has
managed to make its way to our corner of
the universe and number two that there&#39;s
no evidence at all that they have
hostile intentions towards this planet
and number three that the priority at
this point must be trying to establish
some sort of a liaison to them some sort
of a diplomatic way alone to them and
that&#39;s what we&#39;re working on
we contribute over with yes officer X a
high ranking military veteran joined
forces with dr. Greer in order to use
his military and government influence to
gain access to high-level officials
well dr. Greer did indeed a mountain of
an initiative and did go to him to
Washington did speak with high-level
government people I attended and helped
him with that we briefed certain members
of Congress some of their staffs some of
the people from the White House we
talked with people in the Pentagon it
led me to the
that people in high-level government
have very very little if any information
valid information one of the most
important of all the meetings was with
CIA director R james Woolsey here I fly
up to Washington the cover story was a
dinner party one of the things that I
found was that this CIA director wasn&#39;t
lying when he communicated to us that he
had not had access to these projects he
was shaken to his core we met for not 20
minutes almost three hours and by the
end of it I handed him my hands were
shaking I handed him this document and
it was a position paper recommending
executive orders and the things the
Clinton administration and he needed to
do to get control of this mess and he
looked at it he looked at me he says yes
he says but how do we disclose that
which we have no access to
and I almost wept I went what dr. Greer
approached many DC officials in an
attempt to gain an audience one of the
people who took him seriously was former
CIA director Bill Colby who if there&#39;s
truth in it there can be a danger in
that situation we&#39;ve seen that happen in
other cases I said you have to consider
the possibility of some danger to not
only your reputation but to your person
I mean there are people do react rather
violently to some kinds of charges or
particularly if they&#39;re true
now you know I&#39;m a 30-some year-old
doctor with four kids a golden retriever
and a house in North Carolina so I&#39;m
going this is down the rabbit hole fast
but that is the situation my friends
when you&#39;re dealing with secrecy that is
criminal and illegal in 1997 in an
effort to push his message deeper into
Congress in the White House greer headed
to Phoenix to prepare a video with his
best evidence to show in Washington DC
while he was in the editing room the
biggest UFO witnessed events in history
is about to happen
March 13th 1997 when the hale-bopp comet
was very clear in the south Northwest
sky thousands of people are outside
trying to get a glimpse of it when they
also caught a glimpse these orbs giant
orbs equidistant in a v-formation
of a mile to two mile wide and some very
credible reports and that&#39;s the
particular area where these phenomena
keep popping up from my vantage point
the Native Americans living in the basin
between South Mountain and the estrellas
have told me that not only were they
looking up at the Phoenix lights during
the mass sighting but they&#39;ve been
looking up with them for centuries I
live in a community called loop
northeast of Flagstaff on the Navajo
Indian Reservation
we&#39;ll have to go back in time one day
before we saw six to seven lights that
were circling along the horizon the
entire street came out it was almost
like a block party everybody turned off
their lights everybody sat in their
front yards and everybody watched this
unusual light show I squeezed down the
best of what I found and finally came
forward in 2004 with the Phoenix lights
a skeptics discovery that we are not
alone
10,000 people approximately witnessed is
one of the largest experience of the
sword ever recorded the Phoenix lights
phenomena didn&#39;t seem to be falsifiable
in any way it was being validated by
which everybody bets on the ultimate
choice a insult was the governor of the
state of Arizona Fife Symington finally
calling a news conference saying that he
has finally got the answer to the
Phoenix lights and he introduces some
staff member dressed up as a space a
people that very angry because here is
the top elected official of the state
making fun of what I estimate to be
close to probably 10,000 people saw this
under the watchful eye of the public
Symington retracted his statement if you
had been here 10 years ago and standing
out here and looking up there at the at
the lights in the view you would have
been astounded you would have been
amazed the so-called Phoenix lights were
seen by many people in 1997 skeptics say
there were military aircraft or flares
but not the former governor who&#39;s
probably some form of an alien
spacecraft
Barcelona
dr. Bravo are you ready for the trend
I&#39;m so excited
wonderful working on yelp waiting
emergence upon driving in Spain to look
at the being for the very first time I
was kind of skeptical it was definitely
a game-changer for my thought process to
actually see it in person that to see it
on film the first thing we had to do was
go to the radiology lab because we
needed x-rays in cats camp before we did
anything let me take it out and look
what a big heaping
okay money : another this is no the head
radiologist at the center solid beam I
was quite impressed and first thing she
said Wow looks like an ailing
cat scan images started coming up on the
computer
it was just profound and I saw inside
the bone and I saw you know organs and
blood aterial bringing material I knew
that this is not a hoax it was not fake
that this is actually some sort of
living creature right well somebody made
it they have a future in microsurgery
because they were smart enough then to
put in these millimeter wide of bone
holes where the arteries go in to feed
the bone marrow and so now the challenge
is to prove what it is right my interest
frankly is to disprove that it&#39;s
anything unusual or anything paranormal
I would like to prove that this is human
I would like to prove that this is just
an interesting mutation but obviously if
you leave your mind to open or I should
say if you leave your mind closed to
alternatives you&#39;ll never see what those
alternatives might actually be in every
situation with scientists your
reputations at stake you know I have
every expectation that even doing this
is going to lead to some ribbing from
some of my colleagues right but I think
that that&#39;s perfectly acceptable because
at the end of the day who&#39;s going to
validate these things if someone isn&#39;t
willing to step forward and do it right
then you&#39;re going to have it sitting out
there forever hanging in limbo right I
mean if you let other people and their
opinions stop you from believing what
you know to be true then all you&#39;re
doing is stopping the possibility of
progress
anytime anybody tries to study this
subject seriously
we&#39;re subject to ridicule I&#39;m a full
professor at a relatively major
university and I&#39;m certain that my
colleagues at the University laugh at me
and and hoot and holler behind my back
when they hear that I have an interest
in studying unidentified flying objects
there&#39;s really a subtle kind of
suppression of play here you don&#39;t worry
about what the CEO of Enron thinks about
what you say you worry about what your
friends think you worry about what your
parents would think if you posted
whatever you care about on Facebook or
something we take the risk to appear to
be a crackpot there may be people who
are going to be threatened by that for
any number of reasons my feeling was
that I was involved in a lot of strange
activities so I tried to say to myself
let&#39;s not look at this with too much
exposure and mention it because there&#39;s
a question of credibility this should be
the subject of rigorous scientific
investigation and not the subject of
rubbishing by tabloid newspapers MUFON
is the mutual UFO network and it was
founded in 1969 by Walt Andres and our
mission statement is the scientific
study of UFOs for the benefit of
humanity MUFON is the world&#39;s largest
UFO investigative organization we have
approximately 3,000 members worldwide
approximately 500 of those have their
PhDs these are people who really would
like to delve deep into the UFO
phenomenon and try to figure out not
only what is it but how it&#39;s happening
armed with what he thought was some of
the best available evidence including
the Phoenix lights Steve Greer organized
a project starlight briefing before
several Congress and gone and White
House staff members
things seem to be on the track
disclosure of the with a lot of detail
and it&#39;s a cutaway this was done and
escaped government control where I event
waters case took 20-some years in
England so this is in our possession and
not the Ministry of Defense would never
go into a black hole but then the bad
news came Shari Adamiak Steve&#39;s partner
and longtime friend along with Steve and
another team member were all suddenly
diagnosed with a malignant cancer I&#39;ve
had these experiences since I was a
child or a young man but the to
articulate him so other people
understand him I need someone with
capacity to hear it she was that person
I mean this van can&#39;t resolve it was
very hard for me you know
but one of the last places she wanted to
come was here so she asked that her her
ashes be placed on the land so we put
her ashes around that tree
I don&#39;t take anything for granted
frankly and so each time that I do a
presentation or lead a group I think
this may be the last time
the thing that has kept me going the
most is not any external thing
but the experience of that near-death
experience where I know that there&#39;s an
aspect of us that doesn&#39;t die that is
why I can go mano-a-mano with these
elements and not be afraid
I shouldn&#39;t say could be afraid not
stand down everyone has fear I&#39;ve
certainly had my fears but it gives you
an anchor so that you can go forward
more than ever
dr. Greer understood when he had always
sensed was not the power of a cosmic
field or quantum vacuum that would
propel us into a new world it was the
mind this really is the opening to an
entirely new science of consciousness
you can maybe think of consciousness as
a television set on the TV screen you
see pictures and sounds and so forth and
if you tried to find out where that was
coming from and you looked inside the
television you&#39;re not gonna find it it&#39;s
not there the signal is in the radio
waves around it invisible to us that&#39;s
being interpreted by the television as
pictures and sounds so this is very much
like the state of how we understand the
mind and consciousness dr. John at
Princeton proved that putting your
awareness on a device that was a random
number generator would affect it so you
have this random number generator and
it&#39;s producing 50/50 ones and zeroes and
then you introduce a person into the
picture and you tell them try to affect
it with their mind I think more ones or
more zeroes you measure that and sure
enough what they found was that there
are more ones or more zeroes being
produced that correlate to that person&#39;s
attention so you can see effects being
produced forwards and backwards in time
which is really strange distance doesn&#39;t
seem to matter as much you can get the
same strength of effects if you&#39;re right
in front of the RG or if you&#39;re on the
other side of the planet
consciousness is a non-local field and
it isn&#39;t limited to your brain waves and
body dr. John once had the opportunity
to ask the Dalai Lama if he thought the
random number generators themselves were
conscious and the Dalai Lama thought
about it and his reply was that if you
think they&#39;re conscious then they&#39;re
conscious just like consciousness can
have positive effects on the zeitgeist
or ether you can also work the other way
unfortunately when you start to deal
with inventors who have anomalous
results that seem to be over unity
paranoia seems to accompany that process
and John Searles famous for having a
circular magnetic device that has both
energy and propulsion and built into one
unit and the electric company felt that
this guy was stealing money took him to
court went to jail his house caught fire
and all of his property you know all of
his designs burnt the concept of freedom
this sort of idea of people having the
Liberty to pursue happiness and to
pursue abundance this has been
completely in a sense turned upside down
we actually reprinted a report on the
military involvement of the Department
of Energy and it&#39;s so extensive it&#39;s the
major operation that goes on there there
have been over 5,000 patents that have
been sequestered by the national
security state taken out of the public
domain many of them deal with energy
technologies
it&#39;s policy that the military seems to
feel is necessary for national security
however at this point we often wonder 50
years after World War two in the Cold
War whether such sequestering is
necessary
suppression of new technology would be
an obvious play in the idea and strength
of a free market system yet it still
seems to happen right in front of our
eyes this is a huge controversy one of
the largest maybe most intense
controversies in history of science
there&#39;s nothing worse I found than
suggesting to academic physicists in
particular and academics in general that
they are not only wrong but disastrously
wrong catastrophic Allah wrong
coal fusion patents have not been
approved they will not get through
American citizens of being denied their
constitutional rights I inadvertently
was looking through some piles of paper
that had been given to me in a casual
manner by all these hot fusion
physicists as they were trying to do
their calorimetric repeat of the pons
Fleischmann experiment and I was stunned
I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing it
looked like monkey business to me at the
time and it has turned out to be exactly
that it was represented as a negative
result when it was positive and that
data is scientific fraud as far as I&#39;m
concerned it&#39;s been referred to legal
authorities in the government I asked
for a review at MIT got nowhere if this
type of manipulation had occurred in any
legitimate research area such as cancer
research AIDS research
global warming research anything that&#39;s
accepted as reasonable to be researching
the people would lose their jobs they
wouldn&#39;t be in science and yet these
people today their data is used today to
year 2000 and all before to reject
patents
yes there is serious criminal activity
going on that ultimately must be rooted
out
it became very clear to me that you know
you kind of had a tiger by the tail here
and that this was serious for a moment
dr. Greer considered shutting everything
down he had been threatened and swindled
far too many times sherry was gone
he had no office no staff no money
literally the month that Shari adamak
passed away within 30 days I have this
scheduled event so she just want a war
came and she&#39;s an emergency doctor like
I am that was in 1998 by 2000 when we
were planning and storyboarding and
working the whole disclosure project
event out and pulling together all these
hundreds of witnesses we didn&#39;t really
have the funding to do it but she got so
supportive and involved that she lived
very modestly and took all of her excess
income and donated it
and I want to acknowledge some amazing
people that are here dr. Jan Bravo
without whom we would not have the
disclosure project but it&#39;s not just a
funding she&#39;s provided it&#39;s the moral
support and the encouragement and the
friendship and and so she&#39;s just an it
become a very key person and you know
it&#39;s sort of metaphysical and odd that
literally the month that Shari adamak
passed away within 30 days I have this
scheduled event not alone anymore with
the support of a loyal team dr. Greer
grew his witness list from a couple
dozen to over 200 see that little dot
rated that that don&#39;t belong there
they said I&#39;m one of those what you
would call the high government official
in the FAA I was the division chief it
was only three or four down from the
Admiral I was awarded the Air Force
guided missile insignia I was the first
photographic officer in the Air Force to
get the they called it the missile badge
so it was a call but he says we got a
problem here what&#39;s the problem he says
well it&#39;s that UFO
we weren&#39;t launching real nuclear
weapons we were watching dummy warheads
they were the exact size shape and
dimension and weight and we were looking
down south west and the missile popped
up through the fog it was just beautiful
and I hollered there it is then our guys
on our m45 tracking mount with 180 inch
lenses on it got it we sent the film
back down to Vandenberg the Japanese
airline 747 was coming from the
Northwest going across the Alaskan
territory he called and asked the
controller if the controller had any
traffic at his altitude
his radar is picking up a target he sees
this target with his with his eye and
the target the way he described it
a huge ball with the lights running
around it and I think he said it was
like four times as big as a 747 I was
called in to major major Mansmann office
at the first strategic aerospace
division headquarters and a major
Mansmann said watch this
there was the launch from the day or two
before it had Big Sur we watched that
stage burn out we watch the second stage
burn out we watch a third stage burn out
and it&#39;s going like this and into the
frame came something else it flew into
the frame like this and it shot a beam
of light at the warhead fires another
beam of light goes around like this
we&#39;re going like this fires another beam
of light goes down like this far is
another beam of light and then flies out
the way it came in and the warhead
tumbles out of the outer space they
brought in three people from the FBI
three people from the CIA and three
people from Reagan&#39;s scientific study
team and I don&#39;t know where the rest of
the people with when they got done they
actually swore all these other guys into
this never took place this was one of
the guys from the CIA no I saw that I
don&#39;t give a goddamn what anybody else
says about it I saw that on film fill
class can kiss my ass he wasn&#39;t there I
was he said this the first time they
ever had 30 minutes of radar data on a
UFO he said you are never to speak of
this again
as far as you&#39;re concerned this never
happened so I said yes sir and walked
out and that was the last I talked about
it for 18 years
I had the original video that I took and
I had the pilots report and I had the
FAA z-- first report that was all
downstairs a my my table they didn&#39;t ask
that so I didn&#39;t give it to him there
are things that I know about that I did
in the service that I won&#39;t talk about
to you now because they&#39;re top secret
and I could get my ass in trouble for
talking about him if you parse what
major Mansmann said he said you&#39;re to
say this never happened
well that&#39;s not classifying it top
secret is it and I was a part of a
United States Air Force cover-up for 18
years but who do you tell that you were
involved in a UFO incident without them
looking at you like you ain&#39;t wrapped
too tight what we photographed up there
affected me for the rest of my life and
made a huge impact on my understanding
of the universe and of governmental
manipulation of of our minds
now with the witnesses on his side dr.
Greer had the firepower to attack
Washington again we are not alone
that&#39;s the message a group of pilot
scientists and former government
officials won Congress to hear 21
members of that group already have
testified in Washington for what&#39;s known
as the disclosure project and we had all
volunteers who organized that whole
event and there was no paid staff so
when people look at that whole period we
didn&#39;t have a we didn&#39;t have an office a
secretary and one paid staff person but
we did it dr. Steven Greer heads up the
disclosure project a group that compiles
information from people who say they&#39;ve
encountered extraterrestrial forms of
life 20 years ago in 1980 I was a
security specialist assigned an RAF
Bentwaters objects made incursions over
RWS a fired bit pencil-thin beams of
light into them and adversely affected
the ordnance possibly the robot &#39;is that
were involved with some of these crashes
also some were alive what do members
plan to do with their information they
hope Congress and President Bush take
notice that we are asking for the US
Congress and for President Bush to move
towards an official inquiry and
disclosure on this subject those that
don&#39;t want to believe you will never
believe here anyway so it doesn&#39;t matter
it doesn&#39;t change the truth a
spokesperson for the Senate Science
Technology and Space Committee says no
congressional hearings are planned right
now Elaine Quijano CNN
I stand before you today in my almighty
god and I tell you this if Congress
calls me in and says will you testify in
detail what you know I stand here today
prepared and ready to do just that
governments must never lie to the people
thank you
the number of people dr. Greer had
managed to get behind him was monumental
in a perfect world an event of this
proportion with that amount of coverage
would have been enough to start a
legitimate movement but of course we
hardly live in a perfect world 9/11
became the mother of all news stories
and completely changed the game for
everyone fear panic and strife were
imprinted in the public consciousness to
what end not to go after al-qaida but
rather to invade the sovereign nation of
Iraq given such a drastically overt
misstep on the part of a US government
led by an oil family the question on
some people&#39;s minds is whether or not
this disaster was exploited or worse
engineered gulf of tonkin in the Vietnam
War Chiang kai-shek in the Korean War
false flag operations are nothing new
however according to some the ultimate
card to play might be yet to come
how do you grow the trillion-dollar
military-industrial complex that
Eisenhower warned about into a two or
three trillion dollar program you got to
have a bigger enemy out there
von Braun&#39;s purpose in life during the
last years of his life his dying years
was to educate the public and
decision-makers about space-based
weapons first the Russians were the
enemy against whom we&#39;re gonna build
space-based weapons then terrorists
would be identified and that was soon to
follow in 1977 I was at a meeting in
Fairchild industries and in that
movement room were a lot of charts on
the walls with enemies identified
enemies names that people had never
heard of names like Saddam Hussein and
Gaddafi but we were talking then about
terrorists the potential terrorists no
one had ever talked about this before
and they continued the conversation
about how they were going to antagonize
these enemies and that at some point
there was going to be a war in the Gulf
according to these theorists after the
military-industrial complex had its war
against terrorism the next enemy dr. von
Braun identified on earth
third world country fanatics but with no
more enemies left the people would soon
be taught to look into space the next
enemy was asteroids now at this point he
kind of chuckled the first time he said
it asteroids against asteroids were
going to build space-based weapons so it
was funny then and the funniest one of
all was against what he called aliens
extraterrestrials that would be the
final card and over and over and over
during the four years that I knew him
and was giving his speeches for him he
would bring up that last card and
remember cow all of it is a lie
99% of all the information out in the
public on this subject is well-crafted
disinformation designed to scare people
to support the next phase in global
warfare and this kind of corruption is
why the only things that are being made
on this subject are things that re down
to paranoia and fear and the
military-industrial complex
I occasionally think how quickly our
differences worldwide would vanish if we
were facing an alien threat from outside
this world I don&#39;t think we&#39;re moving
forward if we trade you know factional
and ideological war from one ethnic or
religious or economic system into an
interplanetary conflict because that&#39;s a
not survivable and B would be even worse
in terms of galvanizing the world around
a military structure that has been the
central organizing principle of our
society for a few thousand years
actually it is hard to concretely prove
that 9/11 was a false flag attack
because the people behind it are so good
at covering their tracks especially with
the compliance of mainstream media if
you had trillions of dollars
you&#39;d be pretty good after to the
adversaries closer to home it&#39;s the
Pentagon bureaucracy according to some
estimates we cannot track 2.3 trillion
dollars in transactions 2.3 trillion
dollars according to the Comptroller
General of the United States there are
serious financial problems at the
Pentagon fiscal year 1999 2.3 trillion
missing fiscal year 2000 1.1 trillion
missing and DOD is the number one reason
why the government can&#39;t balance his
checkbook I would like for you to
respond to the questions that I&#39;ve put
to you today I&#39;ve forgotten what the
second question was how does one carve
out a billion unacknowledged or 10
billion unacknowledged taxpayer dollars
in many cases at the end of the fiscal
year when there is so-called leftover
money they may or may not know that
money may in fact go to a special access
program there are two main types of
special access programs acknowledged and
unacknowledged or you saps those
programs are basically totally off the
books and they are able to actually
vacuum up money to be self-perpetuating
funding mechanism
certain use apps are waived and also
completely managed and controlled by
private contractors so they enjoy the
secrecy protections only afforded to
private corporations there is virtually
no high-level government oversight for
these types of usage in many cases no
elected official including even the
president have knowledge a particular
use app even exists
between 1947 1949 the government passed
the National Security Act and the CIA
Act these laws allowed the intelligence
community to withdraw money from any
agency without disclosure essentially
money could be stolen from any program
and no elected official would ever know
about it look at this creature and you
look at the cranial vault how large it
is the the size from the eyes up is at
least three times that of a human one of
the first things that dr. Lachman
immediately remarked upon was the shape
of the head in the skull it was not
something that he is accustomed to
seeing and it was quite interesting and
some ways exciting that the Associated
features that you would expect from a
syndrome of that nature were not found
yeah
this specimen does not fall under any
known to me class of disorders or
syndromes in many respects the
proportions of the spine and extremities
are normal
the major abnormalities appear to be one
the size of the specimen mid-face
hypoplasia and under development of the
jaw and that the specimen has only ten
ribs humans normally have 12 rarely 11
one of the most remarkable aspects of
this is when we came down to study the
actual bone density one of the features
of fetuses that specialist looks at is
the so called growth plates of the
epiphyseal joint say of the knees the
the shock I think and the surprise was
and the and the absolute certainty that
dr. Laughlin had was that this specimen
is between the age of 6 to 8 years old
the shock was that this specimen was
clearly not fetal how do you explain how
something six inches tall survived to
any length of time that would allow for
it to survive a hundred or a thousand
years ago
and what amazes me is the media well
they&#39;re so compromised of this they
don&#39;t do anything they don&#39;t dare do
anything but follow the company line on
it the company line being a series of
lies this is a document talking about
the current program at the CIA and it
says that the PA o Public Affairs Office
has relationships with reporters from
every underlying major wire service
newspaper news weekly and television
network in the nation in many instances
we have persuaded reporters to postpone
change hold or even scrap stories that
could have adversely affected national
security now what&#39;s the purpose of this
the CIA has no mandate for anything
domestic FBI is domestic what the hell
is this where are we now we are in a
bread and circus this is a phrase used
to describe the creation of public
approval not through excellent public
policy but rather through diversion and
distraction keep people fat keep them
happy to keep them diverted and keep
them entertained with dribble and shock
and nonsense that&#39;s unfortunately the
sort of thing that has taken the place
of news and information so that what
we&#39;re seeing today is a world in which
perception is being managed by as little
as five major media corporations who
collectively control magazines
newspapers corporate news websites
television stations movies documentaries
who are these people who could be behind
the curtain who could possibly be
controlling us
so effectively a shadowy government with
its own Air Force his own Navy his own
fundraising mechanism and the ability to
pursue his own ideas of the national
interest free from all checks and
balance
and free from the law itself whatever
activity is going on to the extent that
it is a clandestine group at cause a
government group a quasi a private group
it is without any type as far as I can
tell of high-level government oversight
and that is a great concern ladies and
gentlemen the very word secrecy is
repugnant in a free and open society and
there is very grave danger for we are
opposed around the world by a monolithic
and ruthless conspiracy that relies
primarily on infiltration instead of
invasion on subversion instead of
Elections it&#39;s preparations are
concealed not published it&#39;s mistakes
are buried not headlined
it&#39;s dissenters are silenced not praised
it is a system which has conscripted
vast human and material resources into
the building of a tightly knit highly
efficient machine that combines military
diplomatic intelligence economic
scientific and political operations and
we are as a people inherently and
historically opposed to secret societies
to secret oaths and to secret
proceedings
pequeño de la Costa not too much tissue
are there no piece of the bone from at
least uh like a 0.5 of a millimeter in
oh maybe a medium Ethel
we took material from inside the cranium
also two clippings of the anterior front
ribs of this bean and we were able to
see under the dissecting microscope that
in fact it did have bone marrow in them
so that meant there should be some good
genetic material in there it was really
nerve wracking imagine you know two big
guys here trying to operate on this 13th
on their long beam but we did it
the DNA analysis is being done by some
of the world&#39;s best but even the world&#39;s
best need to be cross-checked which is
why I&#39;m doing the three different
facilities
so I actually went in for samples I ran
a sample of my own blood I was very
small amount just 100 microliters I ran
two blanks things that just had water in
them because that would be essentially a
contamination of control and then of
course the sample itself and really the
all-important first result was whether
or not there was in fact any DNA which
was isolated and the actual shock for me
was when I got the amount of DNA out of
this sample it was way above what I had
originally expected what you have on the
left here is a so called DNA ladder this
is a size standard this one on the end
is in fact my DNA and it has an expected
size distribution as well as some
banding and validating the original
measurement is this analysis that
basically shows that we have a nice
distribution for the samples DNA
when we physicists look for alien
civilizations we don&#39;t look for little
green men we look for energy consumption
we look for type 1 type 2 and type 3
civilizations what are we we are type
zero we got our energy from dead plants
oil and coal around the year 2100 we
will become a type one civilization and
we see the beginnings of that now what
is the Internet the Internet is a type
one telephone system imagine if you will
sitting down to your morning coffee
turning on your home computer to read
the day&#39;s newspaper well it&#39;s not as
far-fetched as it may seem information
has largely been controlled in a
top-down way what we&#39;re seeing now is
the dissemination of discoveries coming
up from the grassroots and not from a
top-down centralized authority which has
the ability to say this isn&#39;t making it
because we don&#39;t believe it&#39;s true this
is making it because it fits the
mainstream when we want to form a new
team in the new country then all we have
to do is contact someone there using the
internet and suddenly they&#39;re a member
of the node from this online collective
seems to come a real communion people
from all over a gather
groups to investigate UFOs with safety
in numbers against ridicule and
disinformation what we found in the past
is we had a lot of anecdotal stories but
we didn&#39;t have a whole lot of data with
the advent of computers personal
computers and the Internet we&#39;ve been
able to collect the data and analyze it
through some 200 plus data points to
allow us to be able to compare cases and
to see exactly what&#39;s happening and what
the trends are Nick Pope is our guest he
made this information public he&#39;s also
the former head of the Ministry of
Defense&#39;s UFO project so if anybody
knows we think it&#39;s you Nick the
Ministry of Defence is in the process of
declassifying and releasing its entire
archive of UFO FILES going back decades
it&#39;s interesting and worth pointing out
that while the British government is
releasing their files in their documents
President Obama who promised to do the
same during the campaign he still has
not 15 years
but I figured that you know after the
disclosure Friday we&#39;d get this
information out and we keep going with
life how do we keep battering the RAM at
this door where do we find the strength
to keep going for when you think that
you&#39;re the only person that has the
knowledge you become marginalized Steve
was instrumental in bringing together a
large group who had been involved in
this subject and who for the first time
realized that they were not alone in
trying to come forward on the subject
government&#39;s we&#39;ve discovered have not
gone far enough so we&#39;ve decided that
it&#39;s people using the ce-5 protocols
form our own movement and do what
governments have not been doing and we
think of this as the people&#39;s disclosure
movement and so we feel it&#39;s important
to create an effort that&#39;s a global
effort which this has become my name is
Mark Benz and this is Rex and we&#39;re in
Bodega California and we&#39;re doing ce-5
my name is Jeff bird and here in
Winchester Virginia USA we are doing
ce-5 my name is Peggy Brewster and here
in Middleton you know think of America
we are doing the e5 we have eleven
hundred and fifty teams of cd5
ambassadors which has spread over 52
countries my name is Andre and here in
Sweden we are doing ce-5 it&#39;s about c5
here in Burlington Ontario Brisbane
Australia from Chester Virginia Hamilton
Ohio we are
good boy I&#39;m a Daniel Daniel tuna sauce
is Leo Ortiz and here in Vancouver
British Columbia to see if I&#39;ve to see
if I&#39;ve complex to Mars say a single CD
5z5 we&#39;re doing ce-5 and the reason I
think that&#39;s so important is that it not
only builds the knowledge base but it
also further potentiates this concept of
pioneering a new pattern of peaceful
contact and that is something that no
other group large group on earth is
doing certainly isn&#39;t being done by the
State Department and and the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee it seems to
be it only takes one person to make
contact but hundreds of voices worldwide
does a call that can&#39;t be missed and
likewise with innovation the more heads
in the game the more likely we are to
find a solution there&#39;s many many
technologies that people have talked
about many ways to the mountaintop we
have so many modes of converting quantum
vacuum energy or zero-point energy some
people think they know how to do it okay
fine but if you do it theoretically
that&#39;s one thing but then you got to do
it experimental that&#39;s the hard part
those opposed to new energy technologies
can tie the hands of hundreds of
inventors but how will they ever fare
against tens of thousands output Miller
amperage is more than the input
fear indicator of overunity I&#39;m gonna
ask you to look away
I love my hands what it hurts
the life I have isn&#39;t what I&#39;d seen
the sky is not blue inside
when you oscillate or vibrate magnetic
fields there&#39;s an effect in the gravity
field how to do that linkage is what
you&#39;re trying to get at is I Maxwell&#39;s
equations are in that term right there
and what happens is if you&#39;re gonna have
a gravitational effect it&#39;s going to
happen over there
this channel here represents revolutions
per minute
these are representing weight that we&#39;re
measuring on the load cells
full steam ahead
look at our data we lost 70 cents of
Waitrose we move this thing and it loses
weight and must be generating gravity
waves though the device maintains its
shape and size in terms of dimension it
is losing maths that&#39;s a possibility
if it is losing mass then certainly it
would also be affecting time in a very
localized manner by looking at new
technology you could break through new
commercial aspects to improve our
society we should be looking for a
disruptive breakthrough in this
technology within the next 10 years
we&#39;re on the brink of developing any
number of potential propulsion systems
which would take us out of the solar
system I think we&#39;re going to beat NASA
to the market so I graduated from the
UCLA School of Engineering in 1976 got a
flier from the School of Engineering
inviting me to a lecture by Ben rich Ben
rich was the director of Lockheed
skunkworks for 16 years
the oversaw a number of use apps that
were secretly managed at the skunk works
including most notably the development
of the f-117 stealth fighter
been shared a slide set of about 40
slides of different things starting with
the u-2 spy plane going all the way up
to the stealth fighter at that time
mentioning that he couldn&#39;t talk about
the other secret stuff but when he ended
his talk was he had a slide of a black
disc zipping off into outer space and he
added is taught this talk with these
words we now have the technology to take
e.t home so you have to have vision and
you have to have the guts the courage to
go out past the steps and do something
of any value and we have to go past our
grasp and we ask them questions about it
you know what you mean when you said we
have the technology to take e.t moments
been shared three major things that I
think are worthy of research by
researchers worldwide at this point in
time first was we&#39;ve somehow figured out
how to do interstellar travel already
it&#39;s known the second point he made was
that there was an error in the equations
my suspicion is is probably Maxwell&#39;s
equations for electro magnetic magnetic
theory the third thing he said was how
does ESP work and I was really kind of
startled to because I didn&#39;t know what
to say but I blurted out I don&#39;t know
all points in time and space are
connected and he looked at me back in
the eye and he said that&#39;s how it works
history has taught us that to simply
innovate new technology may not be
enough we have to find a way to get past
the suppression we&#39;ve already now had a
breakthrough just a couple months ago of
the tritium battery finally a company
has come up with an actual
commercializable unit but it&#39;s very
small it&#39;s designed for an hour IC or
some small circuit component so this is
a good sign because it shows the way to
introduce a free energy device is to
introduce a small version of it if you
have a revolutionary energy device it
has to be introduced in a way that
doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s revolution
science is always changing I mean even
back in the 1960s they thought that
biofeedback for example was impossible
but now of course we know that that
itself is an absurd statements we have
even toys on the market that allow
people to you know play these Sciences
have been around for decades they have
been ruthlessly kept secret because of
the kleptocracy of what I call the petro
fascists the people who are hell-bent on
maintaining the power of a centralized
petro dollar oil gas coal system so that
does create scarcity because that is a
zero-sum game but when you take us off
that system onto this new system it&#39;s an
entirely new macroeconomic order and
scarcity becomes non-existent after
years of disappointments dr. Greer and
his team are now attempting to build an
Energy Research Lab in Virginia where
scientists and inventors with working
prototypes will have a safe haven to
build
so this is an example of how the
analysis is done using what&#39;s called a
genome browser and it&#39;s more or less a
schematic representation of the
chromosomes and at a very high level of
resolution so the sequence that we got
from the mitochondria tells us with
extremely high confidence that the
mother was an indigenous Indian from the
Chilean area and the haplotype is called
B 2a now the other thing that
immediately fell out of the analysis is
that it&#39;s male it has so-called Y
chromosome material in fact it&#39;s got a
full white chromosome it probably died
in the last century if I were to make a
guess I can say with absolute certainty
that it is not a monkey right it is
human or as close to human closer to
human than chimpanzees would be but when
you count up the number of mutations
that were observing what we&#39;re seeing is
more than what we would expect to be
caused by simple cell division when the
sequencer is creating or making these
reads it&#39;s doing it more or less at
random
so what does the computer program do
that people have written and designed it
takes every one of the little sequences
and tries to match it against the known
and then anything that doesn&#39;t match it
puts in a little side file and says this
is unknown at a certain point when
enough knowns are matched I can feel
comfortable saying oh this is human
right but if I&#39;m not careful and I don&#39;t
pay attention to what&#39;s in the garbage
can right what the computer program is
throwing away I could literally be
throwing the baby out with the bathwater
what we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve scaled back and
we&#39;re seeing several chromosomes and
pieces of chromosomes across the top
which basically leaves us with a very
strange conundrum right here you&#39;ve got
this six inch tall let&#39;s call it human
right because the DNA says that so
it&#39;s human at least the way that we&#39;re
looking at it this gene PC NT which is
known to be associated with primordial
dwarfism we don&#39;t have any mutations
here it lived to the age of six to eight
obviously it was breathing it was eating
it was metabolizing and it wasn&#39;t living
in an environment where there was a lot
of advanced medical attention that was
given to it to allow it to live to that
age causing the question how big the
thing might have been when it was born
so genetically you might explain that by
saying that there&#39;s some advanced aging
mutation something that caused the bone
to age anomalously quickly a gene that&#39;s
known to be associated with progeria
that also no changes there so the next
problem of course is the the ribs and
the number of ribs in the specimen only
ten whereas they&#39;re supposed to be 12 so
there are no mutations which are
specifically associated with that kind
of phenomena because it&#39;s rarely if ever
seen the digits are all correct the
hands are all correct there are problems
with the face so there&#39;s a mid-face
hypoplasia and then there&#39;s the larger
skull so again I think in summary there
are genes associated with any one or two
of the anomalies that we see in the
specimen but there is no mutation which
is known to accommodate or call for all
of the mutations even with the things
that we know could be assigned to one or
more of the anomalies we don&#39;t find them
in the genetics of this specimen that
leaves open the question what genetics
is causing the anomalies that we are
observing so although I entered this
thinking DNA was the answer it made me
realize that in the context of the
bigger biology questions there are other
levels of control that need to be
understood and answered the non-coding
RNA epigenetics etc and things that we
probably haven&#39;t even thought
yet so if I just look at this is
base-pair nineteen million eight hundred
thousand or so at this edge of the open
region I can go all the way over here
and now I&#39;m at twenty-one thousand or
twenty-two thousand
so the answer is not finished and it&#39;s
not as easy as actually frankly I
thought it was going to be at the
beginning so that&#39;s basically two
million base pairs of DNA where nothing
seems to say it&#39;s just like the way
societies do things they try to fit
things in boxes we have literally
written a computer program that does
exactly that tries to fit in on the box
doesn&#39;t seem very efficient so on that
basis people would call it junk but I
think we now know that there&#39;s any of a
number of other features of what DNA is
doing in there it is expressed and so we
need to be careful obviously that we
don&#39;t let our instincts or the programs
that we write to match our instincts
make the decisions for us no matter what
for me this has been a fascinating more
than an exercise as soon as I&#39;ve
collated this information into a form
that other people can take advantage of
and it&#39;s accepted for publication I&#39;m
just going to put it out on the web you
know I don&#39;t have the resources to study
and follow down every single angle that
this opens up but you know maybe there
is a listener out there who will be
sufficiently intrigued by this to do the
analyses themselves and maybe they&#39;ll
find something that I missed
great if additional samples or examples
are seen of this I&#39;ll be the first in
line to want to sequence it because then
all bets are off I want to say other
things here but I also don&#39;t want to
open myself up for you know attack
this search may have uncovered a major
finding about life in the universe
it&#39;s origins
what is this beam could it be a missing
link in evolution could it be an
entirely new species or simply a disease
we have never seen before or could this
be an extraterrestrial being from
another world
whatever the case may be this challenges
the boundaries view scientific knowledge
dr. Gary Nolan has set a new precedent
for scientific investigation and rigor
in the realm of the seemingly impossible
now we have now over 4,000 cases of
extraterrestrial vehicles that have
landed 3500 pilot cases over 5000
documents from the US government and
hundreds of thousands of pages of
documents from 14 countries that have
opened their files since the disclosure
project was launched 11 years ago and
yet and yet this is an on CNN every
night and this is probably the most
important thing going on in this planet
today and yet nobody talks about it
if we don&#39;t explore what to do we&#39;re
gonna miss the boat and that could be
why Eisenhower&#39;s final message wasn&#39;t
just doom and gloom it was a charge to
the people to spit out the bread look
away from the circus and take some
responsibility only an alert and
knowledgeable citizenry can compel the
proper meshing of the huge industrial
and military machinery of Defense with
our peaceful methods and goals
the dam is in fact working and you&#39;re
beginning to see countries all over the
world begin to come forward with what
they know to be absolute effect since
2001 24 countries have opened their UFO
FILES to the public
including Australia the UK Vatican City
Germany Russia and Canada the United
States is not yet among them what we
have to do is pave the way for these
leaders because if the people will lead
the leaders will follow they&#39;ll have to
and it isn&#39;t about overthrowing the
Pentagon it&#39;s about leaving it behind
my goal when I started this was to make
this so that I wasn&#39;t it important at
all in it that there would be enough
people that they go on without me and
that way that matter if I drop dead the
future is here already the technologies
are here contact is happening and if we
come together as a people what we&#39;re
gonna find is that all of us working
together are going to be able to create
a world that is amazing if every single
one of us told everyone we know that
we&#39;re being visited by intelligent life
that the sciences are here to give us a
new civilization we&#39;re liberated from
that macroeconomic slavery or this is
the destiny of humanity thank you very
much god bless you all
thank you
what we&#39;ve come to learn is this we are
standing at the precipice of a new age
there is power in the many but only when
they&#39;re acting as one that&#39;s when
resonance happens whether joining
together as a responsible citizenry
against the forces standing to divide us
or joining consciousness to unite with
the beings who are prepared to
communicate with us
in order to succeed in this endeavor or
life we must come together as one
