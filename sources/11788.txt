  		              		Experience Description   

    I left my body when my heart stopped beating and I flatlined. 

  I was rising up to the level of the ceiling and I saw my body in the intensive care room. I went into a tunnel. On each side of the tunnel, I saw deceased members of my family. They made fun of me. I heard very soft sounds and saw radiant colors that didn't dazzle me.  

I was advancing towards a very bright, white light at the end of a tunnel. My little brother Philippe, who died 12 years before, took me by the hand and was smiling at me while taking me in front of the light. 

A strong, but not nasty voice, asked me why I wanted to die. I answered that the absence of my little brother was too hard for me, and that my mother felt resentful towards me because of Philippe's death. Phillip died of  leukemia at the age of 7 and I was not compatible as a marrow donor.

 I said that I took all the medications that I could find in the medicine chest, and that my mother didn't do anything to stop me. I know that it was God talking to me, as he said that I had to go back to my family, that I would give birth to six children, and that I still had a mission to accomplish. I wanted so much to stay there because I was surrounded by unconditional love. But, I saw my lifeless body as well as the doctors doing everything to reanimate me. I brutally came back into my body through the top of my head and I opened the eyes. 

I was crying a lot as I didn't want to come back.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   A CVA in 2015. I had a cardiac arrest and saw the deceased of my family again. God was at the end of this Passing into or through a tunnel, that I seen for the second time, and he told me that it wasn't the moment yet to join my loved ones.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         There really is another life after our physical death.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Why doesn't the medical profession take us seriously? Why did I have to see a psychiatrist who had me admit into a psychiatric facility, because I discussed my experience with the doctors reanimating me? Why are religions all saying that this subject is taboo? Is it possible to create associations all over the world, including small towns, for experiencers? In France, father François Brune is dealing with this subject, and the Catholic religion didn't appreciate his stand for the experiencers, and it's impossible for me to get his address and phone number. Do you believe that it could be possible to form this kind of associations everywhere in the world?
