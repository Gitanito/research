INTRODUCTO;RY REMARKS.
The following outline of Phreno-Mnemotechny, is not
intended as a treatise on the subject, from which a learner
can, without assistance, obtain a knowledge of this interest-
ing Science. The design of this work is to aid the Author
in his lectures, by presenting the application of the System
to a variety of subjects, omitting all, or nearly all explana-
tion in the work, but giving them during his course of Iec?-
tures. If the author of this treatise has a piJWer of memory
beyqnd most others, the cause lies in this System. To be-
come fluent in Phreno-Mnemotechny, requires but little
time ; depending on the industry and tact of the learner.
Having disposed of an edition of one thousand copies,
within three months, the following greatly improved edition
is published. The dates, names and facts, embodied in the
work, having been compared with the most approved author-
ities, can be relied on as correct. In the first eight pages the
learner will find examples of words containing one, two,
three and four articulations, which will comprise a sufficient
. variety for practice in translation. 'Fhe study necessary to
become familiar with the subject is very little, comparatively
nothing ; what is necessary is practice. The pages follow-
ing the first eight, will contain t:ome valuable tables of in-
formation on a variety of interesting subjects. The learn-
ing of these tables willbe found a very easy,task, though
it is not a necessary exercise in becoming acquainted with
t'Qe Art by which they are .}earned. They will usually be
committed to memory for the information they convey, and
in so doing, the student's progress in Phreno-Mnemotechny
·will be facilitated. PLINY MILES.

techny, before he pronounces it
a. " humbug," he would only be
convicted of an incapacity to
comprehend it ; but in giving it
a. wholesale denunciation, while
totally ignorant of the subject,
he adds to ignorance and stupid-
ity/ the most consumate impu-
dence and knavery. Could there
be a better personification of the
" Booby," than he ? We think
not. '
100 Regina! Heber, Bishop of Hin-
dostan. Eminent as a " builder
of the lofty rhyme," and an ex-
pounder of the word of God.
His Missionary Hymn will be
read, sung and admired as-long
as the English language is
spoken, the Christian religion
endures, and feeling hearts are
known.

tesy, and then rides in a PHAETON.

o:rThe object of this problem, all the squares of the CheSs-bQard
being systematically numbered, is to conduct the Knight all overthe
board, from No.1, or any other number, to come back again to the
same point whence it started from, .without its having stepped twice
upon the same square, in its course.
This interesting problem WllS solved by the celebrated mathemati-
cian Euler, after a number ofyears. of constant expeFiments.
The Ches1-board being numbered:
The Knight, if starting from No. 1, will have.to run over the fol
lowing squares, namely:

A Dutch vessel having lost a number of hands in a gale at sea, a
press-gang was sent ashore to obtain recruits. The requisite number
being procured, and brought on board, their names were asked, and
registered in the ships books. The last man called, gave his name
as follows:
" Hadad, Hughdnd, Pipe and Pin Hute, and Brass ; Nip Nop and
Pin Davis, Acco Yunahon, Con Tunken, Van Heuven Barrack;

REMARKS.
Would the natural memory be able to learn and retain perman~nt­
ly such n large number of facts ns the numerous and lengthy Tables
contained in this book1 And would any person, however gifted, be
enabled to commit to memory, each page in from thirty minutes to
one hour's time, (as the most of these pages were committed) and re
tain the whole without any efforts or study, to be called up at a mo-
ment~ notice, with accuracy and perfect certainty 1 I presume I.
am correct in believing that not one person in the world, with the
exception of the compiler of this, knows three-fourths of the tables
and facts contained here; nor probably one person in a thousand
that can tell a quarter of it : facts that are interesting to every per-
son of an inquiring mind. This may appear egotistical ; but let it
be understood that 1 Jay no claim to a knowledge of statistical Sci-
ence, only through the medium of Phreno-Mnemotechny. With
many thanks for the cordial support received during my Lectures in
the west, for the last eight months, I close my remarks, and give
place to the opinions of persons, the most-of whom are considered
good authority on all subjects of general interest.
Detroit, December 5, 1844. PLINY MILES.
PHRENO-MNEMOTECHNY.
The undersigned, members of Mr. Pliny Miles' class, to whom,
by a course of six lectures, just closed, he has imparted the new Sys-
tem of Phreno-Mnemotechny, invented and taught by Professor Fau-
vel-Gouraud, deem it a pleasure to express the satisfaction with which
they have attended Mr. .Miles' lectures, and their admiration of the
ingenious and interesting principles of this truly wonderful Art.
To improve the memory ; to be furnished with a striking, easily
acquired method of storing the mind with useful knowledge, is a de-
sideratum which every reading man must highly appreciate. We
have it in this Art.
The unparalleled success of its introduction to the public by its
learned originator, and the unfailing certainty of the instruction
conveyed, prove its high claims to the confidence of all who wish to
acquire it.
The principles are simple, easily remembered, perfectly certain in
their application to the recollection of names, events and facts-to a
wide range of historical, mathematical, political, religious nnd va-
rious :;;cientific information, and in its application to these subjects we
have been surprised and delighted at its power over the memory.
To the ability and diligence with which 1\fr Miles instructshis clas-
ses we bear the most cordial testimony ; and trust that the success of
his introduction to any of the intelligent communities of this State,
will be commensurate with his talents, and courteous deportment, nnd
the importance of the Art he teaches.

1 believe it the greatest discovery in Literahue that the present age
has seen. Everything about it ;,bows the work of n master mind,
and exhibits a versutility of mental power far beyond any thing ofthe
kind I have ever met with. Nothing short of a wonderful mind
. could have developed anything at once so useful, ingenious and
.beautiful. Its discoverer brings with him letters of the strongest
.character, from a multitude of the most eminent minds in the
United States; men who confess the deepest obligations to him
for his Mnemotechnic Science. • • • • • Nothing approaching its
powers for perfecting human knowledge is to be found in human re-
cords, and all who apply themselves to it, will look on this discov-
ery as one of the greatest of human benefits.
As a parent, and as a student, I would not be deprived ofthe ben-
efits of Professor Gouraud's System for five thousand dollars. It
has benefits in it that mankind should be induced to enjoy.
THEO. S. BELL, M. D.
Louisville, Ky., June27,1844.
At a meeting of the cia~ attending the lectures on Phreno-Mne-
motechny by Prof. Pliny Miles, in the city of Louisville, Prof. J.
H. Harney, President of Louisville College, was elected Qhairman,
and Mr. Otis Patten, Secretary. The following resolutions were
passed by the unanimous vote of the class :
Resolved, That we consider the system of Phreno-Mnemotechny
taught by Professor Miles, a most beautiful, ingenious, and useful
System of Artificial Memory, and that its value and importance can
hardly be overrated.
Resolved, That while in our opinion persons of all ages may be
greatly benefuted by the system, we consider it especially adapted to
produce very important and beneficial results in the education of the
young.
Resolved, That Professor Miles has fulfilled in good faith, and to
our entire satisfaction, all the pledges he gave in his Introductory

I take pleasure in saying that in· my opinion this system is capa-
ble of imparting to those who do it justice, a vast facility in acquir-
ing knowledge of any kind, and of retaining it for an indefinite pe-
riod of time, in a manner, and with a certainty utterly impractica-
ble in any other way. I take pleasure in recommending Mr. Miles,
to the attention of the community, as a gentleman who will afford
them both pleasure and profit in the deli very of his Lectu:-es.
