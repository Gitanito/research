MADAM,
IT is with feelings of the most devout respect and
veneration, that, by your Imperial permission, I take the
present opportunity of laying the following Work at your
Highness feet.
According to your Imperial Highness gracious com
mands, this Translation, although in some passages free,
(in order to adapt it to the customs of England,) is still
almost a fac-simile, of the only and original Manuscript,
lately in possession of the ever-to-be-lamented Emperor
and King.
In adhering strictly to your Imperial commands, I hope
that my endeavours to embellish the Work, according to
the original Drawings, will meet with your Imperial
Highness gracious approbation.
With feelings of the most profound respect,
I remain,
Your Imperial Highness'
Devoted Servant,
HERMAN KIRCHENHOFFER.

TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.
THE following Work is translated from a Manuscript, in the German lan
guage, which was found among the camp equipage belonging to the late
Emperor of France, when he retreated from Leipzic, after the defeat of his
army, in the year 1813. It fell to the lot of a Prussian officer, who, ignorant .
of
its
great value, sold
it
for
a
few Napoleons
to
a
French general officer,
then
a
prisoner
of
war
in
the fortress
of
Koningsburg. This gentleman
aware
of
its
great importance, and knowing from Napoleon's arms, which
were emblazoned upon
it,
that
it
once belonged
to
his imperial master, was
resolved
on
his return
to
France
to
present
it
at
the Tuilleries; but alas!
he
did not live
to
accomplish this purpose; for, although
his
medical attendants
gave him every hope
of
recovery from his wounds, their efforts
to
restore him
to
health proved unavailing, for
he
died soon after from mortification which
took place after amputation
of
the right arm.
By will, hastily drawn up, the personal offocts
of
this officer were trans
mitted
to
his family, who were enjoined
to
take the earliest opportunity
of
putting the Manuscript
in
question into the Emperor's own hands; but Na
poleon's manifold occupations, both civil and military, from time
to
time,
prevented this.
During the early part
of
Napoleon's ostracism
in
St. Helena, means were
found
of
conveying the Manuscript
to
the Empress, who unfortunately never
had
an
opportunity, although she eagerly sought for
it,
of
sending
it
to
her
husband. After his death her Highness gave the Translator her imperial
permission for
its
publication
in
the English language.
Regarding the purpose which Napoleon had
in
view
in
the private perusal
of
this Work,
it
is
necessary
to
inform the Reader; but, previous
to
this,
it
will
be
proper
to
state the manner
in
which
he
himself became possessed
of it.
It
is
well known that many French artists and literati accompanied
General Bonaparte
in
his famous expedition
to
Egypt, for the purpose
of
exploring the antiquities
of
that celebrated region, where once flourished
vi.

| PREFACE.
the arts and sciences, in greater perfection than in any other country in the
world, the most civilized nations of Europe in the present day not excepted.
At the head of the Commission of Arts was M. Sonnini, whose travels
have since excited so much attention. This gentleman having succeeded in
perforating a passage into the interior chamber of one of the royal tombs in
Mount Lybicus, near Thebes, found therein a Sarcophagus, in which was a
mummy of extraordinary beauty, and in fine preservation. Having examined
this curiosity very minutely, he discovered attached by a peculiar kind of
gum to the left breast, a long roll of papyrus, which, having unrolled, greatly
excited his curiosity on account of the hieroglyghics which were beautifully
painted on
it.
M. Sonnini's deseription
of
these tombs, which are
of
the most astonishing
structure,
is
as
follows: The whole
of
the mountain Lybicus, which begins
at
half
a
league
to
the west
of
the Memnonium, and ends immediately oppo
site
to
Medinet-abou,
is
pierced from
its
base
to
three-fourths
of
its
elevation
with
a
great number
of
sepulchral grottos. Those which are nearest the
surface
of
the ground are the most spacious,
as
well
as
the most decorated
;
those which are
in
the most elevated part
of the mountain are much more
rudely contrived and executed; while such as
hold the middle place, bear
an
adjusted proportion
of
space and ornament. Those which belong
to
the
poor are the most interesting, because they always contain some representa
tion
of
the arts which flourished, and the trades which were practised,
at
that epoch. The plan
of
these grottos
is
in
a
great measure the same.
A
door, opening towards the east, displays
a
gallery
of
about twenty feet
in
length, which
is
sometimes formed
in
a
straight line, and
at
other times runs
off from the entrance
in
a
right angle
:
it
is
indifferently supported
by
columns
or
pilasters,
of
which the number varies from four
to
ten. At the
extremity
of
the gallery are wells which lead
to
the catacombs, where the
mummies are deposited. The depth
of
these wells varies from forty
to
sixty
feet, and they are connected with long subterraneous passages, rudely shaped
in
the rock, which terminate
in
a
chamber
of
about thirty feet square, whose
sides are supported
by
pilasters, and contain large remains
of
the mummies.
There are evident traces of numerous other subterraneous communications,
which probably lead
to
other chambers, that are
at
present concealed.
In the upper gallery are sculptured
in
basso-relievo,
or
painted
in
fresco,
a
crowd
of
subjects relating
to
funeral ceremonies. The most interesting
pictures which are seen there, offer
a
detail of circumstances connected with
the ancient inhabitants
of
the country. There, are represented their first
occupations, such
as
the chase and the fishery; thence we may trace the
progress
of
civilization,
in
the employments
of
the sadler, the cartwright, the
potter, the money-changer, the husbandman, and
in
the duties and punish
f PREFACE. º vii.
ments of military life. Each grotto is adorned with a ceiling painted with
subjects of fancy, and whose design is exactly the same as that of the paper
hangings which were fashionable in France about thirty years ago.
The tombs of the kings are about six thousand four hundred paces from
the river. They have been formed in a narrow valley, in the centre of the
mountain Libycus. The ancient way thither is not known, and the spot is
now gained by an artificial passage. These sepulchres occupy a large
ravine, which is flanked by the bed of a torrent. The plan of one of these
tombs will be sufficient to explain the general disposition of the rest. Every
grotto communicates with the valley by a large gate, which opens to a gal
lery hollowed in the rock:
its
breadth and height are generally about twelve
feet, and
its
length
is
twenty paces
to
the second gate, which opens
to
another gallery
of
the same breadth, and twenty-four feet
in
length. To the
right and left
of
this gallery are chambers
of
five feet
in
breadth and ten feet
long. There, are found paintings
of
arms; such
as
hatchets, poignards,
curvated sabres, straight swords, lances, javelins, bows, arrows, quivers,
coats
of
mail, shields, implements
of
husbandry, vases, and trinkets
of
every
kind. The detail
of
preparing food
is
also represented.
A third gallery succeeds,
of
the same dimensions
as
the former, and leads
to
a
chamber above the level
of
the other apartments, which iseighteen feet
square. From this chamber
is
the entrance
to
a
gallery
of
thirty-four paces
in
length; there
is
also
an
inclining gallery, whose length
is
twenty-eight
paces:
at
its
extremity
is
a
corridor
of
sixteen paces, leading
to
a
chamber
of
eleven paces square, which
is
connected with another
of
the same size
by
a
gallery
of
six paces.
A
square saloon then succeeds, supported
by
eight
pillars;
its
length
is
twenty paces, and
its
breadth twenty. Here
is
the sar
cophagus which contained the mummy
of
the king. The Romans made
some attempts
to
carry away this sarcophagus from the grotto where
it
is
deposited; they had even tried
to
level the ground,
in
order
to
facilitate
its
removal, but they very soon renounced the impracticable enterprise.
'
To the saloon
of
the sarcophagus, another apartment succeeds,
of
twenty
five paces
in
breadth, and forty
in
length. The height
of
the tomb
is
seven
feet,
its
length eight, and
its
beadth six: the total length
of
the gallery
is
two
hundred and twenty-five paces. The tombs
of
the kings throughout their
whole extent are covered with pictures and hieroglyphics;* but the greater

part are painted in freseo, and represent the most fantastic subjects that can be
conceived. Here it was that the Romans caught that idea of the grotesque,
which formed a principal subject of their compositions during the second and
third ages of the erapire. The researches into Herculaneum have discovered
a great number of paintings executed in a similar taste.
-
-
One of the most interesting of these grottos contains a sarcophagus that
is still entire and in
its
place.
Its
length
is
sixteen feet,
its
height twelve,
and
its
breadth six.
It
still preserves the lid, adorned with the effigy
of
the
king, which
is
a
single block
of
granite. The astonishment that
is
felt,
on
reflecting that this enormous mass was transported
to
the extremity
of
a
sub
terraneous passage two hundred paces
in
length, exceeds
all
bounds, when
it
is
considered that
it
was worked upon the place where
it
remains. What
difficulties must have been surmounted,
in
order
to
transport
a
weight
of
several hundred tons, across the almost impracticable roads
of
the moun
tain l Here we found the famous mummy and papyrus roll.
Human sacrifices are continually represented,
as
well
as
a
diversity
of
curious Hieroglyphical Figures, one
of
which represents Isis walking
on
the
Earth, and Flowers springing forth from under her Feet.
-
From the time
of
Strabo, there were reckoned seventeen tombs
of
kings:
and we shall still find the same number,
if
we may comprehend
in
this
enumeration
a
superb grotto, whose plan
is
equally large and beautiful with
that
of
the sepulchres
of
the Theban sovereigns. This grotto is half
a
league
to
the north
of
the Memnonium, and
is
scooped out
at
the bottom
of
a
mountain, whose inclosures contain many other tombs: the entrance
of
several
of
them
is
closed, and the greater part
of
them have been violated.
It
appears that those,
of
the ancient Egyptians, who had remained faithful
to
their worship, endeavoured, from respect
to
the memory
of
their princes,
to
conceal the knowledge
of
their sepulchres, either from their conquerors,
or
the professors
of
other religions.
-
The ancient Egyptians, from the king
to
the lowest
of
his subjects, were
very attentive
to
the construction
of
their burying-places,
in
the firm belief
that, after several thousand years, the soul would return
to
inhabit the body,
if,
during that time,
it
should have remained undisturbed. Hence proceeded
the custom
of
embalming, and the position
of
sepulchres
in
places inaccessi
ble
to
the inundation of the river.
In
the neighbourhood
of
the Memnonium, and among the grottos
of
private individuals, many are found which are still filled with the fragments
of
mummies. When the Arabs, who consider the grottos
as
the property
of

each family, apprehend that they may be visited by strangers, they set fire
to the mummies which they contain, in order to turn the curious from the
research. There are some of these caverns still untouched; as the perseve
ring traveller has not yet discovered them.
The sepulchres of the rich are exhausted. None of the mummies which
are sold by the people of the country are dressed in the envelope, upon
which the figure of Death was painted. A few fragments of these envelopes
are
all
which now appear.
It
is
indeed very extraordinary that, except
in
the
present instance,
no
traveller has found the manuscripts
on
the papyrus,
which the mummies
of
distinguished persons never fail
to
enclose. These
manuscripts are without contradiction the most ancient that have been
preserved, and appear
to
contain the prayers made for the dead, and also
the mysterious books used
by
the priests. They are written
in
hieroglyphics
or
characters, and are decorated with drawings that resemble the pictures
which cover the walls
of
the sepulchres. Many
of
the mummies have the
nails, both
of
their hands and feet, gilt. Two rolls
of
the papyrus are some
times found with them, which are often placed under the arm-pits, though
they are also deposited
in
the division
of
the thighs, and near the organs
of
generation.
-
M. Sonnini hastened
to
General Bonaparte, whose curiosity likewise being
much excited by viewing this hieroglyphical treasure, sent for
a
learned
Copt, who, after
an
attentive perusal, discovered
a
key whereby
he
was
enabled
to
decypher the characters. After great labour,
he
accomplished
this task, and dictated
its
contents
to
Napoleon's secretary, who,
in
order
to
preserve the matter secret, translated and wrote them down
in
the German
language.
-
General Bonaparte, having consulted the German translation
of
the roll
regarding some transactions
in
his own life, was amazed
to
find that the
answers given, correspond strictly with what had actually occurred. He
accordingly secured the original and translated Manuscripts
in
his private
cabinet, which ever after accompanied him, until the fatal day
of
Leipzic
above mentioned. They were held
by
him
as
a
sacred treasure, and are
said
to
have been
a
stimulus
to
many
of
his grandest speculations,
he
being
known
to
consult them
on
all occasions. Before each campaign, and
on
the
eve
of
every battle
or
treaty, Napoleon consulted his favourite Oracle.
"
His
grief for the loss
of
this companion
of
his
priyate hours, was excessive and
it
is
said that,
at
Leipzic,
he
even ran the risk
of
being taken,
in
his eager
mess
to
preserve the cabinet, containing
it,
from destruction.
In
a
list, drawn
up
in
Napoleon's own hand-writing,

fixed to the translated Manuscript, are to be seen the following Questions, as
put to the Oracle, with their Answers as received by that illustrious man.
They are here selected, from among many others on account of the very
strong analogy, I might say identity, which exists between them and some
of the most important actions of his life.

PREFACE.

XI.
I shall forbear further quotation, as the rest of the answers in the list are
either obscure, or relative to matters of inferior or domestic import.
Regarding the personal application of the above answers (except the last,
of which I shall speak presently,) to the late Emperor, there can be no
difference of opinion: this is too obvious to admit of any discussion;
indeed, I have been confidently informed, that when he aspired to the impe
rial throne, he was actually transported with rapture and amazement, when
he read the words contained in the Answer to Question 8, viz. Thou shalt
meet with many obstacles, but at length thou shalt attain the highest earthly
power and honour.
In the second Answer to Question 15, that
is,
the last which
I
have
quoted from the Emperor's list, the reader will perceive that the Autocrat
of
Russia
is
indicated; but whether the words have any direct reference
to
what passed before the treaty
of
Tilsit,
or
to
any future boundaries which
have been,
or
may be, opposed
to
Russian aggrandizement,
is
not equally
certain. At all events,
it
must be allowed, that Napoleon's invasion
of
the
Russian territory clearly proves that his own sentiments were
in
entire
accordance with the latter suggestion.
It
had been
a
happy circumstance for Napoleon, had
he
uniformly abided,
or
been ruled
by
answers
to
many other questions, which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
putting
to
the Oracle, and which doubtless, forewarned him
of
danger, and most probably
of
his downfall: but
he
was
so
accustomed,
from
a
long series
of
success
in
almost every pursuit which
he
undertook,
to
look
on
the bright side
of
every circumstance, that,
to
a
mind like his, such
forewarnings were not likely
to
be
productive
of
that salutary restraint which
some
of
his speculations required.
As instances
of
the lamentable effects
of
this want
of
confidence
in
the
oracular counsels contained
in
the following Work,
I
may adduce the battle
of
Leipzic itself, and the fatal consequences
of
the Russian campaign, viz.
the conflagration
of
Moscow, the destruction
of
his brave army, and finally,
the abdication
of
a
sceptre which
he
was long accustomed
to
wave over the
heads
of
those very monarchs who now compelled him
to
relinquish
it.
To return
to
the subject
of
the Manuscripts themselves: What became
of
the original Papyrus
is
not known, but
it
is
supposed that from the frailness
of
its
texture,
it
was destroyed
in
the general pillage.
If,
however,
it
should
be
in
existence, the present proprietor
is
hereby earnestly entreated
to
com
municate thereupon with the Secretary
of
Her Imperial Highness, making
whatever demand for
its
restoration which
he
may deem requisite;
or
he
may,
if
more convenient, deposit
it
in
the Imperial Museum
at
Vienna,
-
xii. priefAcre.
where he shall obtain a receipt for the same in due form. In the care
of the administrators of the Museum, he is required to leave a sealed letter,
addressed to her Imperial Highness' Secretary, containing the demand of
money, which he feels himself entitled
to,
in
the way
of
remuneration.
It
remains now
for
the Translator
to
say something respecting the nature
and quality
of
the Answers which are contained
in
the Book
of
FATE.
In
the first place then respecting the nature
of
the Answers,
it
will appear that
some
of
these seem
to
have
so
direct
a
reference
to
the manners and customs
of
the present age,
as almost
to
deprive them
of
the same just claims
to
an
tiquity which
it
will be allowed the others undoubtedly possess. But this
impression will speedily vanish, when we call
to
mind, that among the
ancient Egyptians the same arts were cultivated,
as
are now carried on
in
England and other countries
at
the present day. Do not the paintings
in
the
tombs, which are still
in
preservation
in
Egypt, prove this?
It
is
likewise
necessary
to
take into account, that the work has already passed through
two successive translations, consequently,
in
some passages there must
be
a
considerable deterioration from the original sense; but more particularly,
as
in
phrases
of
a
domestic
or
professional application,
it
is
sometimes impossi
ble
to
preserve the real idiom
of
a
translated language.
In
my own case,
I
have
to
state, that from
a
long residence
in
this country,
I
have been enabled
to
attain
a
knowledge
of
many
of
the peculiarities both
of
customs and language among the English people. This knowledge has
been
of
great use
in
my recent labours, and
it
will account for those slight
deviations which
I
have sometimes found necessary,
in
adapting an ancient
Egyptian work
to
modern eyes and ears. These deviations, however, are
few, and
I
may add slight; but they will
be
more certainly appreciated
when the Reader has had
an
opportunity
of
perusing the present translation,
and then comparing
it
with the German and French ones, which
I
intend
to
have published immediately
on
my return
to
the Continent.
In
the second place, regarding the quality
of
the Answers,
I
have
to
observe, that they are
of
five kinds, viz, positive, mandatory, presumptive,
admonitory and conditional. As examples,
I
shall select five, (that
is,
one
of
each quality,) from among seventeen, which have been returned
to
various
persons who consulted the Oracle since
it
has been
in
my possession.
*
.
First then,
of
the positive.
It
was asked (Question 17,)
by
a
gentleman,
Will my beloved prove true
in
my absence
1
The Answer returned was,
(Hieroglyphic
of
the Plough,) The affections
of
the being whom thou
lovest, will
be
placed
on
none other but thyself.
PrerACE. xiii.
Example of the mandatory. It was asked (Question 6,) Shall I make,
or mar, my fortune by gambling ! The answer was, (Hieroglyphic of
Cross Bones,) Be warned from henceforth, never play for money, nor
money's worth.
As an example of the presumptive, it was asked, (Question 28,) Shall I
ever find a treasure? The answer was such as to leave no doubt on the
consulter's mind that he should find a treasure; but at the same time it con
tained such good counsel, as to the application of
it,
as
was absolutely
required
by
a
man
of
his circumstances and disposition.
It
was, (Hyeroglyphic
of
Horn
of
Plenty,) When thou findest
a
treasure, teach thy tongue
to
be
silent; and see that thou makest good use
of
thy riches.
-
To exemplify the admonitory,
I
may give
an
instance
of
a
lady who con
sulted the Oracle
in
the following words, (Question 24,) Inform me
of
all
particulars relating
to
my future husband. The Answer was, (Hieroglyphic
of the Bow and Arrow,) Consider well whether thou oughtest,
at
present, to
change thy condition
in
life.
Lastly,
as
an
example
of
the conditional Answers,
Iselect the following.
It
was asked, (Question 19,)
by
the mother
of

of

of
thy offspring, let thy discipline
be
strict, but not severe; lose
no
opportunity
of
improving their understand
ings, and,
in

Another quality which pertains
to
a
few
of
these Answers,
is
the close affi
mity which seems
io
exist betwem them and some
of
the most favourite
moral axioms
in
use among the civilized nations
of
antiquity: but
is
this
to
be
wondered at, when we consider that Egypt had long been the residence
of
the Hebrews, and that
it
had been overrun both by the Greeks and Romans,
who afterwards formed settlements there
!
It
cannot
be
doubted, therefore,
*
that the Hebrews not only retained the arts which they saw cultivated, and
learned
in
Egypt, but also that their priests became possessors
of
copies
of
books which were
in
use
in
the temples. That the Greeks and Romans did
so,
is
beyond speculation; for
it
is
well known (being asserted
by
Herodotus
and other historians) that
all
the Oracles, afterwards established
in
the states
of
Greece and elsewhere, owed their origin
to
books found
in
the Egyptian
temples, which were pillaged and plundered upwards
of
3000 years ago.
That these books were mere transcripts
of
the original copy
of
the work
now given
to
the world, there can likewise
be
no
doubt; consequently, the
inference
is
a
fair one, that, the moral axioms, above spoken of, were bor
rowed from these books, and that, being greatly admired
by
the literati
of

those days, such passages were afterwards transplanted into their own works,
as original.

This explanation of the apparent identity will be perfectly satisfactory to
every candid reader; but, in order to throw as much light on the subject as
possible, I have prefixed to the present work an authentic and interesting
account of the ORACLEs which bore so famous a part in the histories of
ancient Egypt and Greece.

INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT
OF
ArtIBNT ORACLAs.
No institution is more famous than the ancient Oracles of Egypt, Greece
and Rome. They were said to be the will of the gods themselves, and they
were consulted, not only upon every important matter, but even in the affairs
of private life. To make peace or war, to introduce a change of govern
ment, to plant a colony, to enact laws, to raise an edifice, or to marry, were
all
sufficient reasons
to
consult the will
of
the gods. Mankind,
in
consulting
them, showed that they wished
to
pay implicit obedience
to
the command
of
the divinity, and, when they had been favoured with
an
answer, they
acted with more spirit, and with more vigour, conscious that the undertaking
had met with the sanction and approbation
of
heaven.
.
In
this, therefore,
it
will not appear wonderful that
so
many places were sacred
to
oracular
purposes.
The small province
of
Boeotia could once boast
of
her
25
oracles, and
Peloponesus
of
the same number. Not only the chief
of
the gods gave
xvi. INTRODUCTION.
oracles, but in process of time, heroes were admitted to enjoy the same
privileges; and the oracles of a Trophonius and an Antinous, were soon
able to rival the fame of Apollo and of Jupiter. The most celebrated
oracles of antiquity were those of Dodoma, Delphi, Jupiter Ammon &c. The
temple of Delphi seemed to claim a superiority over the other temples;
its
fame was once more extended, and
its
riches were
so
great, that not only
private persons, but even kings and numerous armies, made
it
an
object
of
plunder and ofrapine.
The manner of delivering oracles was different.
A
priestess
at
Delphi
was permitted
to
pronounce the oracles
of
the god, and her delivery
of
the
answers was always attended with acts
of
apparent madness and despe
rate fury. Not only women, but even doves, were the ministers
of
the
temple
of
Dodona; and the suppliant votary was often startled
to
hear his
questions readily answered
by
the decayed trunk,
or
the spreading branches
of
a
neighbouring oak. Amnon conveyed his answers
in
a
plain and open
manner; but Amphiarius required many ablutions and preparatory ceremo
nies, and
he
generally communicated his oracles
to
his suppliants
in
dreams
and visions. Sometimes the first words that were heard, after issuing from
the temple, were deemed the answers
of
the oracles, and sometimes the
modding
or
shaking
of
the head
of
the statue, the motions
of
fishes
in
a
neighbouring lake,
or
their reluctance
in
accepting the food which was
offered
to
them, were
as
strong and valid
as
the most express and most
minute explanations.
-
-
It
is
a
question among the learned, whether the oracles were given
by
the
inspiration
of
evil spirits,
or
whether they proceeded from the imposture
of
the priests. Imposture, however, and forgery, cannot long flourish, and
falsehood becomes its own destroyer; and
on
the contrary,
it
is
well known
how much confidence the people, even
of
an
enlightened age, place upon
dreams, prophecies, and unaccountable incidents. Some have strongly
believed that all the oracles
of
the earth ceased
at
the birth
of
Christ, but the
supposition
is
false.
It
was, indeed, the beginning
of
their decline; but they
remained
in
repute, and were consulted, though perhaps not
so
frequently,
till the fourth century, when Christianity began
to
triumph over paganism.
The oracles often suffered themselves
to
be bribed. Alexander did
it,
but
it
is
well known that Lysander failed
in
the attempt. Herodotus, who first
mentioned the corruption which often prevailed
in
the oracular temples
of
Greece and Egypt, has been severely treated for
his
remarks,
by
the histo
rian Plutarch. Demosthenes
is
also
a
witness
of
the corruption, and
he
observed that the oracles
of
Greece were servilely subservient
to
the will and
pleasure
of
Philip king
of
Macedon,
as
he
beautifully expresses
it
by
the
word Philipidzein. - -
When
in
a
state
of
inspiration, the eyes
of
the Priestess suddenly sparkled,
her hair stood
on
end, and
a
shivering ran over all her body.
In
this con
intropucºr ion.

vulsive state she spoke the oracles of the god, often with loud howlings and
cries, and her articulations were taken down by the priest, and set in order.
Sometimes the spirit of inspiration was more gentle, and not always violent;
yet Plutarch mentions one of the priestesses who was thrown into such an
excessive fury, that not only those that consulted the oracle, but also the
priests that conducted her to the sacred tripod, and attended her during the
inspiration, were terrified and forsook the temple; and so violent was the fit,
that she continued for some days in the most agonizing situation, and at last
died. At Delphos, the Pythia, before she placed herself on the tripod, used
to wash her whole body, and particularly her hair, in the waters of the foun
tain Castalis, at the foot of mount Parnassus. She also shook a laurel tree
that grew near the place, and sometimes ate the leaves, with which she
crowned herself.
~
The Priestess always appeared dressed in the garments of virgins to inti
mate their purity and modesty, and they were solemnly bound to observe
the strictest laws of temperance and chastity, that neither fantastical dresses
nor lascivious behaviour might bring the office, the religion, or the sanctity
of the place into contempt. There was originally but one Pythia, besides
subordinate priests, but afterwards two were chosen, and sometimes more.
The most celebrated of
all
these
is
Phemonoe, who issupposed
by
some
to
have been the first who gave oracles
at
Delphi. The oracles were always
delivered
in
hexameter verses,
a
custom which was some time after discon
tinued. The Pythia was consulted only one month
in
the year, about the
spring.
It
was always required, that those who consulted the oracle should
make large presents
to
Apollo, and from thence arose the opulence, splen
dour, and the magnificence
of
the celebrated temple
of
Delphi. Sacrifices
were also offered
to
the divinity, and
if
the omens proved unfavourable, the
priestess refused
to
give
an
answer. There were generally five priests who
assisted
at
the offering
of
the sacrifices, and there was also another who
attended the Pythia, and assisted her
in
receiving the oracle.
We shall now proceed
to
describe some
of
the most celebrated
of
the
ancient Oracles:
oracle of Delphos.
DeLuros, now called Castri, the capital
of
Phocis,
in
Greece, was anciently
much celebrated for
its
Temple and Oracle
of
Apollo.
It
was also called
Pytho,
by
the poets
:
from the serpent Python, which Apollo killed
in
this
place. Pausanias, however, says that this name Pytho was given
to
the city
of
Delphos,
by
Pythis, son
of
Delphus, and grandson
of
Lycorus. The
Greek historians gave
to
this city the name
of
Delphos, which some suppose
to
have been
so
called from Adelphoi, brethren, because Apollo and his broth
3
xviii. INTRODUCTion.
er Bacchus were both worshipped there; and others, with greater probability
derive the name from Delphos, single, or solitary, referring to the retired
situation of the city among the mountains.
Justin questions, which was the most worthy of admiration, the fortifica
tion of the place, or the majesty of the god, who here delivered his oracles.
The Temple of Apollo occupied a large space, and many streets opened to
it.
The first discovery which laid the foundation
of
the extraordinary vene
ration
in
which the Oracle
of
Delphos was held, and
of
the riches accumula
ted
in
the temple,
is
said
to
have been occasioned by some goats which were
feeding
on
mount Parnassus, near
a
deep and large cavern, with
a
narrow
entrance. These goats having been observed
by
the goat-herd Coretas,
to
frisk and leap after
a
strange manner, and
to
utter unusual sounds immediate
ly
upon their approach
to
the mouth
of
the cavern,
he
had the curiosity
to
view
it,
and found himself seized with the like
fit
of
madness, skipping, dan
cing, and fortelling things
to
come.
At the news
of
this discovery, multitudes flocked thither, many
of
whom
were possessed with such frantic enthusiam, that they threw themselves head
long into the opening
of
the cavern; insomuch, that
it
was necessary
to
issue
an edict, forbidding all persons
to
approach it. This surprising place was
treated with singular veneration, and was soon covered with
a
kind
of
chapel,
which was originally made
of
laurel boughs, and resembled
a
large hut.
This, according
to
the Phocian tradition, was surronded
by
one
of
wax,
raised
up
by
bees. After this
a
third was built
of
solid copper, said
to
have
been the workmanship
of
Vulcan.
This last was destroyed
by
an earthquake, or, according
to
some authors,
by
fire, which melted the copper; and then
a
sumptuous Temple, altogether
of
stone, was erected
by
two excellent architects, Trophimus and Agamedes.
This edifice was destroyed
by
fire
in
the 58th Olympiad,
or
548 years
B.
C.
The Amphictyons proposed
to
be
at
the charge
of
building another;
but the Alcmeonides,
a
rich family
of
Athens, came
to
Delphos, obtained
the honor
of
executing the building, and made
it
more magnificent then they
had
at
first proposed. The riches
of
this Temple, amassed
by
the donations
of
those who frequented
it
and consulted the Oracle, exposed
it
to
various
depredations. At length the Gauls, under the conduct
of
Brennus, came
hither for the same purpose, about 278 years
B.
C.; but they were repulsed
with great slaughter. Last
of
all, Nero robbed
it
of
500
of
its
most precious
brazen and golden statues.
It
has not been ascertained
at
what time this Oracle was founded.
It
is
certain, however, that Apollo was not the first who was consulted here.
AEschylus,
in
his tragedy
of
the Eumenides, says, Terra was the first who
issued oracles
at
Delphi; after her Themis, then Phoebe, another daughter
of
Terra, and,
as
it
is
said, mother
of
Latona, and grandmother
to
Apollo.
Pausanias says, that before Themis, Terra and Neptune had delivered ora
1 NTRODUCTION, XIX.
cles in this place, and some say that Saturn had also been consulted here.
At length the Oracle of Apollo became established and permanent; and such
was
its
reputation, and such were the multitudes from
all
parts that came
to
consult
it,
that the riches which were thus brought into the temple and city,
became so considerable
as
to
be
compared with those
of
the Persian kings.
About the time when this Oracle was first discovered, the whole mystery
requisite
for
obtaining the prophetic gift,
is
said
to
have been merely
to
ap
proach the cavern and inhale the vapour that issued from
it;
and then the
god inspired
all
persons indiscriminately; but
at
length several enthusiasts,
in
the excess
of
their fury, having thrown themselves headlong into the ca
vern,
it
was thought expedient
to
contrive
a
prevention
of
this accident, which
frequently occurred. Accordingly, the Priests placed over the hole, whence
the vapour issued,
a
machine which they called a tripod, because
it
had
three feet, and commissioned
a
woman
to
seat herself
on
it,
where she might
inhale the vapour without danger, because the three feet
of
the machine stood
firmly upon the rock. This Priestess was named Pythia, from the serpent
Python, slain
by
Apollo,
or
from the Greek puthesthia, signifying
to
inquire,
because people came
to
Delphi
to
consult this deity. The females, first em
ployed, were virgins selected with great precaution; but the only qualification
necessary was
to
be
able
to
speak and repeat what the god dictated.
This was done
by
placing her ear close
to
one
of
the horns
of
the altar,
and listening
to
the voice
of
one
of
Apollo's priest,
to
whom the question had
been communicated. This Priest, who stood near the altar,
in the interior
of
the Temple, having been assisted
by
his brethren
in
the necessary devo
tions and sacrifices, opened the BOOK OF FATE, which was deposited
in
the Temple, and after many prayers, worked the required problems. The
ANsw ER, which from the nature
of
the case
in
hand, was often conditional,
being communicated
to
the Priestess
on
the tripod, was, after various cere
monies, delivered
to
the enquiring multitude, or to the individual who came
privately
to
consult the Oracle.
The custom
of
choosing young virgins continued for
a
long time, till one
of
them, who was extremely beautiful, was dishonoured
by
a
young Thes
salian. An express law was then enacted, that none should
be
chosen but
women above fifty years old. At first there was only one Priestess; but
afterwards, there were two
or
three. The oracles were not delivered every
day; but gifts and sacrifices were
in
some cases presented for
a
long time,
and even for
a
whole year; and
it
was only once
a
year,
in
the month bosion,
which answered
to
the beginning
of
spring, that Apollo inspired the Priest
ess. Except
on
this day, she was forbidden, under pain
of
death,
to
go
into
the sanctuary
to
consult Apollo. -
Alexander, before his expedition into Asia, came
to
Delphion one
of
those
days when the sanctuary was shut, and intreated the Priestess
to
mount the
tripod, which she steadily refused, alleging the law which forbade her. The
xx. INTRoduction.
prince, naturally impetuous, became impatient, and drew
the
Priestess
by
force from her cell, and whilst
he
was conducting her
to
the sanctuary, she
took occasion
to
exclaim, My son, Thou ART INVINCIBLE ll" As soon
as
these words were pronounced, Alexander cried out that
he
was satisfied, and
would have no other oracle.
It
is
here
to
be
observed however, that great but unnecessary preparations
were often made for giving mysteriousness
to
the oracle, and for command
ing the respect that was paid
to
it.
Among other circumstances relating
to
the sacrifices that were offered, the Priestess herself fasted three days, and
before she ascended the tripod, she bathed herself
in
the fountain
of
Castalia.
She drank water from that fountain, and chewed laurel-leaves gathered
near
it.
She was then led into the sanctuary
by
the priests, who placed her
upon the tripod.
As soon
as
she began
to
be
agitated by the divine exhalation, said
to
arise
from the cavern, but which was merely the vapour
of
incense burnt there,
in
order
to
give more mystery
to
the affair, her hair stood
on
end, her aspect
became wild and ghastly, her mouth began
to
foam, and her whole body
was suddenly seized with violent tremblings.
In
this condition she attempt
ed
to
escape from the Priests, who detained her by force, while her shrieks
and howlings made the whole temple resound, and filled the by-standers
with
a
sacred horror. -
At length, unable
to
resist the impulse
of
the god, she surrendered herself
up
to
him, and
at
certain intervals uttered from the bottom
of
her stomach,
,
or
belly,
by
the faculty
or
power
of
ventriloquism, some unconnected words,
which the Priests ranged
in
order, and, put
in
form
of
verse, giving them
a
connection which they had not when they were delivered
by
the Priestess.
The oracle being pronounced, the Priestess was taken off the tripod and
conducted back
to
her cell,
where she continued several days
to
recover
herself. Lucan tells us, that speedy death was frequently the consequence
of
her enthusiasm. The oracles pronounced
by
the Priestess being generally
delivered
to
the poets, who attended
on
the occasion, and being put
by
them
into wretched verse, gave occasion
to
the raillery, that Apollo
the
Prince
of
the muses, was the worst
of
poets.
-
The Priests and Priestesses,
to
whose conduct the responses
of
the Oracle
were committed, were however, frequently guilty
of
fraud and imposture.
And many instances might
be
mentioned,
in
which the Delphic Priestess was
not superior
to
corruption. Hence she persuaded the Lacedaemonians
to
assist the people
of
Athens
in
the expulsion
of
the
30
tyrants. Hence also,
she caused Demaratus
to
be
divested
of
the royal dignity
to
make way
for
Cleomenes; and supported the impostor Lysander, when
he
endeavoured
to
ehange the succession
to
the throne
of
Sparta.
It
is
not improbable, that
Themistoeles, who well knew the importance
of
acting against the Persians
s

by sea, inspired the god with the answer he gave, to defend themselves with
walls of wood.
-, * . . - -
These answers were likewise, on many occasions equivocal. Thus, when
Croesus was about to invade the Medes, he consulted this Oracle upon the
success of the war, and received for answer, that by passing the river Halys,
he should win a great empire. But he was left to conjecture, or to determine
by the event, whether this empire was his own or that of his enemies. Such
was also the same Oracle's answer to Pyrrhus,
Aio
te,
Æacida, Romanos vincere posse.
which meant, I say unto thee
O
Greek, thou canst overcome the Romans,
or, I say unto thee, the Romans may overcome the Greeks.

Oracle of Delos.
The Oracle
of
Apollo
in
Delos, was one
of
the most famous Oracles
in
the world, not only for
its
antiquity, but for the richness
of
the sacred pre
sents dedicated
to
the god, and the numbers of persons that resorted hither
from
all
parts for advice;
in
which respect
it
surpassed not only all the
Oracles
of
other gods, but even those
of
Apollo himself that
of
Delphos
alone excepted. Some writers say, thºt the island had the name
of
Delos,
*
from the clear and simple terms
in
which the answers were here given
by
the Oracle, contrary
to
the ambiguity observed
in
other places; but
it
was
consulted only while Apollo made Delos
his
summer residence, for his winter
abode was
at
Patara,
a
city
of
Lycia. The presents offered
by
the votaries
to
Apollo were laid
on
the altar, which,
as
some say, was erected
by
Apollo
himself, when
he
was only four years old, and formed
of
the horns
of
goats,
killed
by
Diana,
on
mount Cynthus.
It
was preserved pure from blood and
every kind
of
pollution,
as
offensive
to
Apollo. The whole island was
an
asylum, which extended
to
all
living creatures, dogs excepted, which were
not suffered
to
be
brought on shore. -
The native deities, Apollo and Diana, had three wers: exº~~. tennales.
erected
for
them
in
this island. Tha'
of
Apollo, was, according
to
Strabo,
(ib.
x.)
begun
by
Ery-apthus,
the
son
of
Cecrops, who
is
said
to
have pos
sessed this Island 1558 years
B.
C.; but
it
was afterwards much enlarged and
embellished
at
the general charge
of
all
the Grecian states. But Plutarch says,
that
it
was one
of
the most stately buildings
in
the universe, and describes
its
altar,
as
deserving
a
place among the seven wonders
of
the world. The
inscription
in
this temple,
as
Aristotle informs
us,
(Ethie.
I.
i.
e.

was
as
xxii. INTRODUCTION.
follows: Of all things the most beautiful is justice, the most useful is
health ; and the most agreeable is the possession of the beloved object.
Round the temple were magnificent porticos, built at the charge of various
princes, as appears from the still legible inscriptions. To this temple the
neighbouring islands sent yearly a company of virgins to celebrate with
dancing the festival of Apollo, and his sister Diana, and to make offerings in
the name of their respective cities.
Delos was held in such reverence by most nations, that even the Persians,
after having laid waste the other islands, and every where destroyed the
temples of the gods, spared Delos ; and Datis, the Persian admiral, forebore .
to anchor in the harbour. -

Oracle of Amnon.
The Temple of Jupiter Amnon was in the deserts of Libya, nine days journey
from Alexandria. It had a famous Oracle, which, according to ancient tradi
tion, was established about 18 centuries before the time of Augustus, by two
doves which flew away from Thebais in Egypt, and came, one to Dodona,
and the other to Libya, where the people were soon informed of their divine
mission. The Oracle of Amnon was consulted by Hercules, Perseus, and
others; but when it pronounced Alexander to be the son of Jupiter, such
flattery destroyed
its
long established reputation, and
in
the age
of
Plutarch
it
was scarcely known. The situation
of
the temple was pleasant; and there
e
-
was near
it
a
fountain whose waters were cold
at
noon and midnight, and
warm
in
the morning and evening. There were above one hundred priests
in
the temple, but the elders only delivered oracles. There was also
an
Oracle
of
Jupiter Amnon
in
AEthiopia.
----eee---
Oracle of Dodona.
Dodona was
a
town
of
Inresp. .
in
Epirus. There was
in
its
neigh
bourhood, upon
a
small hill called Tmarus,
a
--lahrated Oracle
of
Jupiter.
The town and temple
of
the god were first built
by
Leuc.1:... after the
universal deluge.
It
was supposed
to
be
the most ancient Oracle
of
all
Greece, and according
to
the traditions
of
the Egyptians mentioned
by
Herodotus,
it
was founded
by
a
dove. Two black doves,
as
he
relates, took
their flight from the city
of
Thebes
in
Egypt, one
of
which flew
to
the
INTRoduction. xxiii.
temple of Jupiter Amnon, and the other to Dodona, where with a human
voice they acquainted the inhabitants of the country that Jupiter had conse
crated the ground, which in future would give oracles. The extensive grove
which surrounded Jupiter's temple was endowed with the gift of prophecy,
and oracles were frequently delivered by the sacred oaks, and the doves
which inhabited the place. This fabulous tradition of the oracular power
of the doves, is erplained by Herodotus, who observes that some Phoenicians
carried away two priestesses from Egypt, one of which went to fix her resi
dence at Dodona, where the Oracle was established. It may further be
observed, that the fable might have been founded upon the double meaning
of the word peleiai, which signifies doves in most parts of Greece, while in the
dialect of the Epirots, it implies old women. In ancient times the oracles
were delivered by the murmuring of a neighbouring fountain, but the custom
was afterwards changed. Large kettles were suspended in the air near a
brazen statue, which held a lash in
its
hand. When the wind blew strong,
the statue was agitated and struck against one
of
the kettles, which commu
nicated the motion
to
all the rest, and raised that clattering and discordant
din which continued for
a
while, and from which the priests drew their pre
dictions. Some suppose that the noise was occasioned
by
the shaking
of
the
leaves and boughs
of
an
old oak, which the people frequently consulted, and
from which they pretended
to
receive the oracles.
It
may
be
observed with
more probability that the oracles were delivered
by
the priests, who, by con
cealing themselves behind the oaks, gave occasion
to
the multitude
to
believe
that the trees were endowed with the power
of
prophecy. As the ship Argo
was built with some of the oaks
of
the forest
of
Dodona, there were some
beams
in
the vessel which gave oracles
to
the Argonauts, and warned them
against the approach
of
calamity. Within the forest
of
Dodona there was a
stream with
a
fountain
of
cool water, which had the power
of
lighting
a
torch
as
soon
as
it
touched
it.
This fountain was totally dry
at
noonday,
and was restored
to
its
full course
at
midnight, from which time till the ſol
lowing moon
it
began
to
decrease, and
at
the usual hour was again deprived
of
its
waters. The oracles
of
Dodona were originally delivered
by
men, but
afterwards by women.

The Roman Augurs.
*
.
The Augurs were certain Priests
at
Rome who foretold future events,
whence their name,
ab
avium garritu. They were first created
by
Romulus
to
the number
of
three. Servius Tullius added
a
fourth, and the tribunes
of
the people
A.
U.
C.
454, increased the number
to
nine; and Sylla added six
xxiv. INTRODUCTION.
more, during his dictatorship. They had a particular college, and the chief
amongst them was called Magister Collegii. Their office was honourable;
and if any one of them was convicted of any crime, he could not be deprived
of his privilege; an indulgence granted to no other sacerdotal body at Rome.
The augur generally sat on a high tower, to make his observations. His
face was turned towards the east, and he had the north to his left, and the
south at his right. . With a crooked staff he divided the face of the heavens
into four different parts, and afterwards sacrificed to the gods, covering
his head with his vestment. There were generally five things from which
the augurs drew omens : the first consisted in observing the phenomena of
the heavens, such as thunder, lightning, comets, &c. The second kind of
omen was drawn from the chirping or flying of birds. The third was from
the sacred chickens, whose eagerness or indifference in eating the bread
which was thrown to them, was looked upon as lucky or unlucky. The
fourth was from quadrupeds, from their crossing or appearing in some unac
customed place. The fifth was from different casualities, which were called
Dira, such as spilling salt upon a table, or wine upon one's clothes, hearing
strango noises, stumbling or sneezing, meeting a wolf, hare, fox, or pregnant
bitch. Thus did the Romans draw their prophecies; the sight of birds on
the left hand was always deemed a lucky object, and the words sinister and
larvus, though generally supposed to be terms of
ill luck, were always used
by the augurs
in
an
auspicious sense.

The Sibylline Books.
A
strange old woman came once
to
Tarquinius Superbus, king
of
Rome
with mine books, copies
of
the following work, which she said were the
oracLEs
of
THE sibyls, and proffered
to
sell them. But the king making
some scruple about the price, she went away and burnt three
of
them
;
and
returning with the six, asked the same sum
as
before. Tarquin only laughed
at
the humour; upon which the old woman left him once more
;
and after
she had burnt three others, came again with those that were left, but still
kept
to
her old terms. The king began now
to
wonder
at
her obstimacy,
and thinking there might
be
something more than ordinary
in
the business
sent for the Augurs'
to
consult what was
to
be
done. They, when their divi
nations were performed, soon acquainted him what
a
piece
of
impiety
he
had been guilty
of,
by
refusing
a
treasure sent
to
him from heaven, and com.
manded him
to
give whatever she demanded for the books that remained.
The woman received her money, and delivered the writings, and only charg
ing them
by
all
means
to
keep them sacred, immediately vanished. Two
of
INTRODUCTION. xxv.
the nobility were presently after chosen to be the keepers of these oracles,
which were laid up with
all
imaginable care
in
the capitol,
in
a
chest under
ground. They could not
be
consulted without
a
special order
of
the senate,
which was never granted, unless upon receiving some notable defeat, upon
the rising
of
any considerable mutiny
or
sedition
in
the state,
or
upon some
other extraordinary occasion. -
The number of
priests
in
this,
as
in
most other orders, was several times
altered. The Duumviri continued till about the year
of
the city 388, when
the tribunes
of
the people proffered
a
law, that there should
be
ten men
elected for this sarvice, part out
of
the nobility, and part out
of
the commons.
We meet with the Decemviri all along from hence, till about the time
of
Sylla the dictator, when the Quindecemviri occur.
It
were needless
to
give
any farther account
of
the Sibyls, than that they are generally agreed
to
have been ten
in
number; for which we have the authority
of
Varro;
though some make them nine, some four, some three, and some only one.
They all lived
in
different ages and countries, were all prophetesses; and,
according
to
common opinion, foretold the coming
of
our Saviour. As
to
the writing, Dempster tells us,
it
was
on
linen.
Solinus acquaints us, that the books which Tarquin bought, were burnt
in
the conflagration
of
the capitol, the year before Sylla's dictatorship. Yet
there were others
of
their inspired writings,
or
at
least copies
or
extracts
of
them, gathered
up
in
Greece and other parts, upon
a
special search made
by
order
of
the senate; which were kept with the same care
as
the former, till
about the time
of
Theodosius the Great, when the greatest part
of
the
senate having embraced the Christian faith, they began
to
grow out
of
fashion; till
at
last Stilicho burnt them all, under Honorius, for which he
is
severely censured by the poet Rutilius.

Ye who in the sacred city Diospolis, have dedicated your lives to the ser
vice of the King of the Gods and of men HERMEs, the interpreter of the
will of Osiris, greets you!
* To Hermes Trismegistus, a sage as highly revered among them, as Zoroaster was
among the Persians, the Egyptians ascribed the inventions of chief use to human life; and
like every people who are unable to settle the antiquity of their origin, they represented
his works to have outstood the shock even of the universal deluge. They otherwise called
him Thoth; and their priests constantly mantained that from the hieroglyphical characters
upon the pillars he erected, and the sacred books,
all
the philosophy and learning
of
the
world has been derived, and
all
the oracular intelligence has been drawn.

tjNTO THE PRIESTS OF THE TEMPLE. --- xxvii.
It is the will of the Gods, in grand assembly convened, that ye preserve
your lives free from stain and pollution.
It is their will that ye continue to instruct the nations, as far as they may
be permitted to know.
- -
It is the pleasure of Osiris, sitting on his throne of clouds, and surround
ed by the inferior deities, that ye make known to his subjects, his children
upon earth, whatever may concern their DESTINY, and what matters ye
shall find written in the book of books :-THE WRITTEN ROLL OF
MAN'S FATE, now committed to your safe keeping: that ye do this
strictly and truly, without fear of danger, or hope of reward, according to all
questions that may be asked, by individual persons, by tribes, by rulers of
states, and by conquerors of nations.
Osiris commandeth the servants in his favoured sanctuary to shew
favour unto none, in the answers which it will be their duty to give from
this book. Let sacrifices and gifts and invocations be made ; let the ques
tion be asked in
all
humility and strong faith, and when the DIvin
ER
hath
consulted the windings and intricacies
of
the problem, according
to
the in
structions hereunto appended,
let
the result
be
written and handed
to
the
chief PRoPHET
or
PRoPHETEss, (seated
on
a
stool having three legs;) who
shall read and interpret the writing
of
HERMES unto the enquirer,
in
the face
of
all the assembled people.
And the PRoPHET
or
PROPHETEss shall read no writing but what hath
been truly given
to
her
by
the priest who doth officiate
in
the sacrifice; and
the priest shall not add to, nor diminish from, what
he
findeth to
be
the true
answer
to
the question asked,
as
in
this ROLL OF MAN'S FATE con
tained
:
neither shall
he
substitute one answer for another, but
in
all things
he
shall
do
according
to
the instructions herein given.
The highest among the Gods,
in
like way, ordaineth, that
no
bribe, nor
private gift, shall
be
offered
or
taken, either
by
the individual who enquireth,
or
by
the priest who maketh answer
to
the consultation: let the gift, which
is
to
be offered,
be
of
free will, and let
it
be
put upon the altar after the sa
crifice hath been consumed,
in
the face
of
all the people.
If
herein the
priests offend, they shall,
on
the instant,
be
struck down and pinioned
to
the
earth
by
the piercing and fiery arrows which the great Osiris
in
his anger,
speaking from the clouds, hurleth
at
offending mortals.-Look
to
it,
that
in
this, ye offend not.
It
is
further enjoined that
ye
take strict charge
of
this book; that
no
one
but the priests
do
touch
it
with their hands, and that
it
be
preserved
in
a
chest
of
alabaster,
to
be
placed under the altar
in
the midst
of
the temple.
It
is
in

of
the book
be
written
as
occasion
requireth, and that they
be
transmitted unto the priests
of

throughout the earth: also that they

When the body hath been embalmed and sufficiently swathed in fine
cloth, let the roll of writing be placed under the left breast, and let the vest

The body shall then be attended by the princes and priests and people to

HOW THE ENQUIRER SHALL OBTAIN A TRUE ANSWER
To THE QUESTIon which HE PUTTETH To THE orACLE.
When a man or woman doth come to enquire ought of you, O Priests
let the gifts be made and the sacrifices offered up ; and let the invocations of
the servants of the temple be chaunted. - -
When silence hath been restored, the DIvin ER shall direct the stranger
who hath come to enquire of the ORACLE, to trace, with a reed dipped in
the blood of the sacrifice, in the midst of a circle containing the twelve
SIGNs of THE ZoDIAc, five rows of upright or inclined lines, in the manner
following | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | , taking care that each be readi
ly seen to contain more than twelve lines, in respect of the number of the
SIGNs of THE ZoDIAC, but he must by no means do this studiously, or
count the number he hath marked, but guide the reed quickly, so that the
number, while it be more than twelve, shall be entirely of chance, as far as
he knoweth.
-
The DIvi NER shall now reckon from the left unto the right hand line of
of each row, which the enquirer hath written, marking off twelve, thus:
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | and keeping count of the remainder, so
that he may know whether the remaining number of each be odd or even.
If the number of a row be odd, the Divis ER shall attach to the right hand
side thereof one small star, and if it be even, he shall attach two stars; and in
, the same manner with the other rows, as herein set down:
| , | | | * , (odd)
| , || | * * (even)
| , | | | | | * (odd)
|, | | * * * (even)
|, | | | | * * (even)
* The translator feels it incumbent on him, here to notice (from the experience of him
self and others in consulting the Oracle,) that he considers some of the above mentioned
formalities may, on most occasions, be dispensed with. He has found that for
all
ordinary
consultations
the
circle and signs may
be
omitted; and instead
of
a
reed dipped
in
blood,
he
and his friends have, invariably and without the least detriment, used
a
pen dipped
in
*
...
UNTO THE PRIESTS OF THE TEMPLE. xxix.
This double column of stars shall be, to the Divisiºn, for a Sign whereby
he shall be enabled to discover the fate of the ENQUIRER.
Let the ENQUIRER now consult his own breast what he requireth to
know; and whether the matter cometh within compass of the question
herein writ, and set down in order, as followeth.* If it doth, the Enquirer
shall straightway pronounce the question, audibly as it is written, without
adding to, or diminishing therefrom, and shall while he uttereth the words,
point to the number of the questions with the forefinger of his left hand.
The DiviNER, in his proper vestments, having invoked Osiris, shall now
place the forefinger of his right hand on the spot whereon the ENQUIRER
had previously placed the same finger of his left: he shall then search out
among the SIGNs, or columns of stars, placed above the hieroglyphics, for
that individual SIGN, or column, which shall answer in every respect to the
one which hath been cast up, by the addition of the lines previously traced
by the ENQUIRER. º
When the Divin ER hath found the corresponding SIGN, or column of
stars, he must place thereon the forefinger of his left hand; he shall now
move this finger, and likewise the same finger of the right hand, from the
points whereon they have been placed, so that they may approximate, or
meet each other, at right angles. -
The HIERoglyphic whereat the fingers meet, must now be noted; and
the D1 v INER, having looked into the roll, is therein to search out the coun
terpart of the same HIERoglyphic. -
Having found
it,
he
is
to
search further
on
the left hand side
of
the
matter,
or
answers, appended unto this hieroglyphic for the counterpart
of
the SIGN,
or
column
of
stars, which,
in
the commencement
of
the consulta
tion, had incidentally, or BY THE ORDINATION
of
FATE, been produced by
the enumeration
of
the surplus over twelve,
of
the lines traced
by the
ENQUIRER within the circle.
The words attached
to
the SIGN,
or
column
of
stars, will
be
the just and
-
true answer
to
the question put
;
which see
no
one
do
pervert
to
any false
purpose
of
deceit, enmity
or
wickedness.
No further ceremony now remaineth, but that the PRIEST who hath acted
in
the divination,
do
write down the answer truly, and, with his finger placed
upon his lips, hand
it
unto the PRoPHET
or
PROPHETEss, who shall
in
a
loud:
,
voice proclaim
its
contents unto the person who came
to
enquire.f
common ink. As
to
the gifts, sacrifices, and invocations,
he
considers them
in
a
Christian
land
to
be
entirely superfluous; but
in
their stead
it
is
doubtless requisite that the consulter
should have
a
firm reliance
on
the goodness and providence
of
the Creator
of
all
things.

In
order
to
make the English reader,
as
much
as
possible, acquainted with the proper
mode offinding answers
to
the
questions
of
those who consult the Oracle,
it
be
will neces.
xxx, THE WRITING OF BALASP is
In conclusion, I am commanded to write unto you, that it is the duty of
the PRIESTs to instruct
all
those who consult the ORACLE, that
it
behoveth
them
to
be
contented with whatever ANswer, they may through FATE
receive
;
and
to
follow implicitly, and without reservation, whatever the
ORAcLE,
in
its
Answers, may happen
to
dictate.
If
the instructions
of
HER
MEs
be
not obeyed, what booteth
it
to
enquire If the ConsulTER
be
herein disobedient
to
the will
of
Osiris, the evil
be
upon his own head.
Further,
O
PRIESTs be warned
to
make no divination, nor
to
admit of
any gift, sacrifice or consultation, save during the night season, and that too,
only whilst Isis shineth
in
the fulness
of
her beauty. Neither shall
ye
give
Answers
on
those days ornights
in
which either Osiris who ruleth the hea
vens
by
day,
or
the Queen
of
his love, who ruleth
by
night,
do
veil the
comeliness and majesty
of
their countenances from the eyes
of
mortals, and
whilst they
do
retire from the labours
of
their celestial course, whithin the
chambers
of
their sanctuary
of
rest.f
sary here
to
state one example.
I
shall take the same rows
of
lines, and the same SIGN,
or
double column
of
stars,
as
are set down
in
the original instructions for consultation,
as
above. We shall suppose, then, that the QUESTION asked
is
No. 27,
as
marked
in
the
Frontispiece
or
TABLE, viz: Shall my intended journey
be
prosperous
or
unlucky
2
By looking
at
the column
of
stars,
or
Sign, corresponding with that cast
up
we shall find
it
numbered 20, and the consequent HIERoglyphic produced
by
the combination
of
this
SIGN and the QUESTION asked, will be that
of
the CRoss Bon Es.
Now by reference
to
this HIERoGLYPHIc and
its
subservient SIGN,
or
column
of
stars,
in
the Book
of
Fate, (folio 14) we find that the ANswer given
by
the Oracle
is
When
thou hast arrived
at
thy place
of
destination, lose
no
time
in
executing thy errand, and
return without delay, which ANswer, whilst
it
suggests
a
necessary caution, whereby
evil
or
danger
is
avoided, perfectly corresponds with the QUESTION asked.
-
In
a
similar way, appropriate ANswers will
be
given
to
all
the other QUESTIONs
in
the
TABLE
;
that
is,
by
paying attention
to
their particular HIERoGLYPHIcs and SIGNs,
N.
B.
The Translator considers
it
proper
to
state, that
in
order
to
faciliate the search
for the Hieroglyphic (resulting from the combination
of
the QUESTION and SIGN,)
in
the
Book
of
FATE,
it
will
be
necessary for the ConsulTER
to
cast his eye over the highest
line
of
Hieroglyphics
in
the FRONTISPIECE, and
to
note the NUMBER which lies immedi
ately over
it.
This number will
be
found
to
correspond with that folio
of
the Book
of
Fate, over which presides the Hieroglyphic
in
question.
*
I
presume that here the meaning
of
BALASPIs,
is,
that the Oracle should not
be
con
sulted but when the Moon
is
at
the full. Among the ancient Egyptians Isis typified the
Moon, whilst the name
of
Osiris was always given
to
the Sun.
t
By this mode
of
expression,
it
is
evident that eclipses
of
the SUN aud Moon are
meant; But
it
is
necessary
to
notice, that,
as
far
as
the experience
of
the translator and
his friends has enabled them
to
judge, there
is
no
apparent reason
or
necessity for con

fining the consultation of the Oracle to any particular time or season. One thing, however,
the Consulter should be aware
of,
which
is,
that
it
would
be
improper for him
to
ask
two questions
on
the same day;
or
even
to
ask the same questions, with reference
to
the
same subject, twice within one calendar month.

ZOLD LAOLOGY:
On the Science
of
Foretelling Events and Characters
by
the Signs
of
the Zodiac and the Planetary System.
THE period
of
our birth
is
generally marked with some peculiar circum
stances that have
a
visible effect on the future conduct of our lives, our
passions, and our general character. Of these circumstances none appear
more worthy our attention than the situation
of
the planets
at
the moment
when we first respire the breath
of
life; since from
a
judicious and accurate
observation
of
their position
at
that awful time which brings
us
into
a
varied
scene
of
trouble and confusion, may
be
easily gathered what kind
of
existence
our destiny has decreed for us; what propensities will distinguish our career;
what pursuits will mark our way, and what success we may reasonably ex
pect
to
attend our exertions. Thus,
an
education suited
to
our particular
genius and talents may
be
given
us,
and
we
may thereby
be
enabled
to
turn
many
of
those distinguishing peculiarities, which more
or
less stamp all the
beings
of
the human species,
to
our advantage and happiness, that without
this necessary information, might become the sources
of
our WRETCHED
NESS and MISERY.
2 THE BOOK OF FATE.
The philosopher and adept, who suffered no part of the future to escape
his
penetration, has enabled
us
to
afford our readers some useful and enter
taining discoveries
on
the effect
of
the planets over the race
of
man; and
as
the sun
is
the most powerful and conspicuous, we shall proceed
to
mark his
way through the different signs
of
the Zodiac, and show the effect
of
his
revolutions, beginning, for the sake
of
enabling our readers more readily
to
find what they may want, with the month
of
J&nuary, although the ancients
began their year
in
March.

THE BOOK OF FATE. 7
It will be here necessary to observe, that the dispositions and events we
have mentioned will be more forcible in proportion to the progress the sun
has made in the sign; and that they will be considerably altered by a junc
tion of any of the other planets in the sign with the sun; as their motion is
very unequal, we can only lay dowu the general influence they have,
leaving it to the judgment of the reader to apply them ; we shall here lay
down a plan by which they will be enabled to ascertain what planet was
mostly in conjunction with the sun at the time of their birth. When you
have ascertained positively the month and the day, examine your own dis
position, and that with strict impartiality, neither attributing to yourself
virtues you do not possess, nor ascribing to yourself vices to which you are
not addicted. Separate
all
your qualities
in
your mind, and try which
of
them has the greatest sway, by this means you will easily discover what
planet was predominant
at
the time
of
your birth from what we are going
to
describe of them and their influence over human nature.
SATURN
Is
the most malignant
of
all
the planets, and
is
thirty years passing through
the twelve signs, thus
it
happens very rarely that the sun enters the same
sign with him,
at
the same time, which
is
absolutely necessary
to
give an
influence over him. This may
be
deemed
a
very fortunate circumstance for
mankind,
as
persons who are born under his influence are morose, sour,
tyrannical, cruel and bloody
in
their dispositions, given
to
murder and rob
bery,
in
short worse than savages. Whenever blood
is
wantonly shed,
or
murder
is
attended with any shocking barbarity, you may
be
well assured
that Saturn presided
at
the birth
of
those who perpetrated such foul deeds,
it
being the character
of
this planet.
-
JUPITER
Is
twenty-three months
in
performing his revolution through the signs:
his conjunction with the sun therefore happens but seldom
;
those born
under this planet are remarkable for their ungovernable ambition,
to
gratify
which they would trample down the lives and fortunes
of
their fellow crea
tures without remorse, and sever the dearest and most tender ties which
nature has given
to
man.

8 THE BOOK OF FATE.
MARS
Is also twenty-three months journeying through the signs; persons born
under the influence of this planet, who seldom comes in conjunction with
the sun, are remarkable for their desire of glory, and the reputation of being
courageous. Thus it is that men frequently destroy-their fellow-creatures
to satisfy their idle appetites, and acquire a reputation for what they falsely
conceive to be courage and glory. -
VICNUS * -
Is the most benignant of
all
the planets, she presides over, and inspires
that secret desire, that natural impulse which pervades
all
creatures
to
pro
pagate their species, than which nothing can give
so
pure,
so
durable, and
such frequent transport to the thinking mind
;
that inspiration
to
love each
other which
is
found
in
the sexes, entirely
on
her constant attendance
on
the sun. Without Venus,
a
tiresome and stupifying apathy would diffuse
itself over the whole creation; it
is
to
her benign and maternal influence
that
is
owing the existence
of
that desire that constantly urges
us
to
seek
in
each other the comforts
of
which
no
individual
is
capable
of
finding
in
him
self, and
it
is
her alone that keeps this vivifying spark alive
in
the human
breast. Her mildness restrains and ameliorates the rugged suggestions
of
the other planets;
it
is
thus that frequently we witness the ambitious man
losing sight
of
his object, and retiring
to
enjoy the exquisite bliss which
a
iudiciously selected female alone can bestow
;
thus we see the hardy and
veteran soldier, after the fatigues
of
battle, solacing himself
in
the embraces
of
a
favorite female companion; thus
we
see the miser, whose very soul
is
"absorbed
in
the treasure, and who deprives himself
of
every comfort and
necessary
of
life, under the benign influence
of
this planet, suffering
a
be
loved woman
to
bring forth his hoards, and unlºck those chests that the
calls
of
his own nature and the distresses
of
his fellow creatures, essayed
to
open
in
vain;
in
short, every bliss
of
which the lover partakes,
is
owing to
the influence
of
this planet, who happily for mankind
is
found frequently
in
conjunction with the genial sun. Venus may with great truth
be
said
to
light the torch
of
Hymen.
MERCURY
.
Is
equally benignant with Venus, but hath
a
different influence over men
:
he
is
the sun's constant companion, and
it
is
to
him that we are indebted for
wit, memory, understanding, vivacity, and health; but for the predomi
nance
of
some other planet less favorable
to
man, we should enjoy
a
state
of
uninterrupted happiness,
be
equal
in
privileges, and
be
in
continued
felicity from the influence
of
this beneficent state.
- THE MOON
Performs her journey through the signs
in
about thirty-eight days; when
she has the superiority
at
the birth
of
an
infant,
he
is
dull, inactive, heavy,
THE BOOK OF FATE. 9
-
frigid, insensible to those scenes that take place around him, his blood cir
culates feebly through his veins, he is a stranger to the joys of love, and
nothing but the irresistible power of Venus can arouse him from his lethargy,
or set his passions afloat ; when he sacrifices to the hymenial altar, he does
it more after the manner of a brute than a human being, incapable of sin- .
cere attachments; he is like a blank in the universe, neither enjoying
himself nor promoting the enjoyment of others.

A BRIEF PROGNOSTICATION CONCERNING CHILEREN Born
ANY DAY OF THE WEEK.
Sunday, the child shall be of long life, and obtain riches.
Monday, weak and of an effeminate temper, which seldom brings a man
to honor. -
Tuesday, worse: though he may, with extraordinary vigilance, conquer
the inordinate desires to which he will be subject, still be will be in danger
of dying by violence, if he has not great procreation.
Wednesday, he shall be given to the study of learning, and shall profit
thereby.
Thursday, he shall arrive to great honor and dignity.
Friday, he shall be of a strong constitution, yet perhaps lecherous.
Saturday is another bad day, but notwithstanding the child may come to
good, though it be seldom ; but most children born on this day are of a
heavy, dull and dogged disposition.
