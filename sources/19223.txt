yeah regarding disclosure the issues of
free energy technology is this a proper
picture it seems that the direction
we&#39;re in disclosure looking down the
road is one of Greater consciousness
right right well yeah he&#39;s asking me is
the big picture about disclosure is
greater consciousness it&#39;s not just
greater it&#39;s the correct
consciousness that can support a
peaceful application of this and also a
new way of you know as Einstein said no
problem has ever saw by the
consciousness that created it and the
problem of endless war and the problem
of taking every advance of technology
and turn it into a new type of club to
hit someone in the head with this is a
big problem and as this kernel and the
airforce pointed out these technologies
would enable someone in another country
to deliver a payload in less than a
second from the Middle East to
Washington think about it okay so all
technologies can be weaponized now in
covert programs they already have been
but so on the one hand we have to
acknowledge that there&#39;s this secrecy
it&#39;s needs to be overseen properly but
the disclosure is when the work begins
when this information is fully out there
including the technologies beginning to
come out we&#39;re gonna have to completely
change the way the world thinks and
works now it&#39;s going to have to be a
world of collective security where if
there&#39;s anyone anywhere on the face of
the earth that weapon Isis and tries to
use these technologies for harm they are
stopped by all means necessary and I
mean all means necessary could we do it
yes now do we already have the means to
monitor and enforce that yes why haven&#39;t
we because they want to subvert world
peace by keeping endless war going
because war for the recorded history of
the human
has been the central organizing
principle of every city state nation and
they don&#39;t know what to do how do you
organize people if all of a sudden
there&#39;s World Peace so an interplanetary
peace so always point out we don&#39;t want
to have a unified peaceful world in
order to have interplanetary war this is
the going backwards a big step not
forward so but that is the biggest jump
in human consciousness we&#39;ve ever seen
and it is a spiritual and social
psychological issue more deeply than it
is a technological or information one
absolutely 100% yes sir
yes so there&#39;s so many people working on
zero-point and similar approaches and
the genies getting out of the bottle can
they contain all of them and is anyone
close yes they can contain them and yes
there are people close in fact there are
people who have them let me give me one
example we believe there&#39;s a fellow
named Rossi and Italy who has a device
that generates apparently overunity
excess energy and heat although no one
knows the mechanism of action he&#39;s
keeping it a trade secret very big and
probably fatal fatal error the people I
met with who have developed these
systems have all either taken it to
their graves or had them confiscated
before they can get out to the public
significantly because of some central
strategic errors that have to do with
the idea that they&#39;re going to be able
to handle that technology like you would
a new app or a new Silicon Valley
computer system when you&#39;re dealing with
something like this it has to be done
completely openly open-source and you
have to have millions of people know
what&#39;s happening in real time Stan Meyer
took his knowledge to the grave you know
if you look at the workshop I did about
a year ago here is that there have been
literally hundreds or maybe thousands of
people who have discovered this same
effect and they&#39;ve all made the same set
of predictable errors based on their
handling the technology as if it were
conventional technology when it is not
and so I would say yes or are people out
there who are working on it some I
believe have I have a friend at Stanford
University who works who knows a man at
the National Security Agency who
confided that they&#39;re tracking what
Rossi is doing very carefully which
indicates to me were there smoke there&#39;s
fire
they&#39;ve Rossi&#39;s listen heads up so but
strategically
tactically and strategically he&#39;s
handling it in a way that guarantees
failure because by keeping it tightly
held coveting trying to keep it secret
overly concerned with monetizing the
technology instead of getting it out he
is going to step into every booby trap
that&#39;s been set out there and the
chances that it will make its way out to
the public is infinitesimally small and
that&#39;s not just true of Rossi&#39;s
technology but of every other person who
has that same idea again it&#39;s because
the system exists to Hoover up suck up
all those technology and sequester them
now I just recently learned in the last
couple months of a man who was working
with a group of investors who was
funding a man up in New York at a
university a professor a physicist who
had discovered how to take just natural
gas and burn it so there was zero carbon
and a hundred percent utilization that
technology was going through the second
round of funding and was bought out by a
division of the Army and black shelved
this is fairly recent
there was another technology he was
working on dealing with batteries and as
you know like Tesla Motors has like nine
hundred pounds of lithium batteries in
that car is a very inefficient system we
have a Chevy Volt that runs on our solar
farm out in the country but it&#39;s
incredibly backward technology and a man
group had developed a battery that was
instead of 900 pounds a hundred pounds
that would charge in 15 minutes
that would take that the okay but it was
so radical that Tesla and some of the
other groups had put together I think it
was about a billion dollars between two
different groups to acquire it and
British Petroleum came in bought it for
god knows how much and black shelled it
this is fairly recent so these are not
conspiracy this happens air every day so
if you have a technology and you go the
conventional investor route funding
route
route intellectual-property wrote it&#39;s
DOA dead on arrival now we&#39;ve seen this
over and over again going all the way
back a hundred years so you know the
definition of insanity is doing the same
thing over and over again expecting a
different result all right so what I
want to say to these technologists and
inventors is that don&#39;t keep making the
same mistake but ultimately the money
factor and the greed factor and the
power factor people wanting power and
money into the dough they really think
they can just like be like the next
Facebook guy or the next you know
Standard Oil Rockefeller family that
thinking is what ends up being their
Achilles heel because ultimately they
didn&#39;t going to work that way and
someone&#39;s going to have more money and
power than the next person has and
they&#39;re gonna buy it out or it&#39;s gonna
get sequestered through a national
security order so the only way to do it
that I can see is to do it openly
transparently in real time every step of
your development is uploaded to the
internet which is my proposal for the
energy research and development program
we want to do well we don&#39;t have the
funding to put that together
but if I were just to be put on the
advisory board for these new energy
researchers I would say that&#39;s the first
thing you have to do the problem is many
of them are trying to get funding from
people who want to be able to get a
return on their investment so that gets
into the question of you have to find
people who are true angel investors who
want to put the funds in and they may
never see a penny out but that&#39;s very
very hard to do because you know it&#39;s
the the golden lamb that sort of thing
and that&#39;s that&#39;s the real problem and I
think that until we learn that lesson
that the last hundred years of
experience has given us collectively
we&#39;re going to keep making that same
mistake and all I can do is advise I
can&#39;t force folks to do it man we&#39;ll see
I would like to see someone make it
through that juggernaut
and but I&#39;d be very surprised if they do
using the strategies of conventional
business intellectual property finance
and investor concepts
