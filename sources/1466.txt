NEW BIOGRAPHY OF VISIONARY
__________________________________
Interest is growing in the Victorian prophetess Anna Kingsford (1846-1888). In
Psypioneer May 2006, we noted that a new web site devoted to her had been
established. www.anna-kingsford.com. Mrs Kingsford’s illuminations offered a
mystical interpretation of Christianity.
Now Alan Pert, a University of Sydney librarian has reassessed her life in an elegant
illustrated and readable biography “Red Cactus” (Australia, Books and Writers, 2006,
reprinted 2007). http://www-personal.usyd.edu.au/~apert/annakingsford/excerpt.html
This challenges the account given by her co-worker Edward Maitland on many points.
For example, Maitland’s “Life (3rd
edition, 1913) displays a considerable
preoccupation with Spiritualism, but Pert argues (p.195-6) that this was his rather than
Anna’s.
Nevertheless, Anna remains an important part of the psychic scene in the London of
1881 when LIGHT was founded. Her friends such as C.C. Massey and Lady
Caithness recur in many contexts. Pert’s biography, which draws on hitherto unknown
material, is a valuable addition to scholarship.

MODERN SPIRITUALISM
CHAPTER III
THE MENACE OF THE FUTURE
IF a Spiritualist be one who maintains that it is possible and desirable to hold
communication with the spirits of the departed, it must be admitted that such a
definition embraces many classes of believers whose religious tenets and practical
aims may be very divergent in character. There are not a few Spiritualists for
whom the criticisms set out in the present booklet would have but an indirect
application. The sort of person I have mainly in view is the dogmatist who not
only holds that intercourse with departed friends is to be encouraged for the
consolation of the survivors, but that guidance in the most momentous affairs of
life is to be looked for from the same source in ever increasing measure. By these
enthusiasts the high "controls" who purport to impart their wisdom through
mediumistic channels are presented to us as sages whose range of knowledge
embraces the future as well as the past, and who speak as moral teachers with a
breadth of outlook which puts to shame the pitifully narrow theology of the
Churches.
As a representative of the particular mental attitude I have in mind it will be
convenient to take Mr. H. Dennis Bradley, who claims a wide publicity for the two
spiritualistic books which have already appeared under his name, (1) emphasizing
the fact that they have been translated into German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch,
Portuguese and other languages. I have no thought of disputing that the volumes in
question have found a wide circle of readers. It is for that very reason that they are
selected here for special notice.
When Mr. Horace Greeley, to whom reference has more than once been made
in these articles, summed up his views on Spiritualism in his "Recollections of a
Busy Life," he concluded his list of seven more important objections with the
following statement:
VII. I find my "spiritual" friends nowise less bigoted, less intolerant, than the
devotees at other shrines. They do not allow me to see through my own eyes,
but insist that I shall see through theirs. If my conclusions from certain data
differ from theirs, they will not allow my stupidity to account for our difference,
but insist on attributing it to hypocrisy, or some other form of rascality. I
cannot reconcile this harsh judgment with their professions of liberality, their
talk of philosophy. But, if I speak at all, I must report what I see and hear.
I venture to think that those who are best acquainted with the writings of Sir A.
C. Doyle, Mr. H. Dennis Bradley and some other of the more conspicuous
representatives of the movement, will hardly venture to dispute the justice of this par-
ticular criticism. Whether it be the conviction that the views they enunciate are
97
endorsed by the denizens of the highest spheres, or whether it be a sort of bluff
engendered by the anticipation of hostile criticism, it would be hard in any other
department of literature to find a parallel for the self-confidence with which these
writers propound their conclusions.
Mr. Bradley, for example, believes that his book "Towards the Stars" is "the most
staggering record of the evidence for survival ever published." (2) He informs us that
"since I possess a keen intelligence, my impressions are of infinitely greater value than
those of any scientist or theorist," (3) also that "my experience in these two years
amounts to more than the whole of the Society for Psychical Research put together for
the forty odd years of their existence." (4) He wrote to Sir Oliver Lodge in February,
1925: "With regard to the phenomenon of voice mediumship I feel that I understand
more of this than any scientist in the world." (5) He speaks of himself more than once as
"one of the most advanced scientific investigators of this form of phenomenon." (6) He
tells us further that "as a psychologist, my psychical studies have sharpened my powers
of observation, and human character is easily stripped of its decoration and veils." (7) If
he mentions that he is "a writer of international repute," he assures his readers that "this
statement is not any blatancy on my part; it is an irrefutable proof of the trend of the
studious mind," and he supplements it with the remark, "I can now read the mentality of
any man or woman within a few minutes." (8)
One feels, it must be confessed, a momentary doubt whether Mr. Bradley has been
equally successful in reading his own mentality; but he certainly manifests no
diffidence in pronouncing judgment upon the intellectual shortcomings of opponents.
He gives us an inkling of his attitude to criticism on the second page of "Towards the
Stars." "My philosophy," he says, "will be regarded by fools as insanity. Which
argument will be advanced by material [? materialist] leaders in defence of their own
disgusting imbecility." To this he adds: "My words are to the new and virile generation;
I despise the decadence of worn-out minds. To them I concede only the spittle of my
scorn"; (9) or again:
Does any fool imagine, after the revelations that have been made to me, that I
care one iota how the scientific critics may regard my evidence? Like beaten curs
the foolish and dull witted unbelievers may seek refuge with the herd-like cry of
"telepathy" or "subconscious mind" or some such drivelling explanation. (10)
Similarly he proclaims: "I quench the fire of my contempt for any fools who
dare to say that all this is telepathy." (11) "I am going to advance an argument
which mutton-headed imbeciles may scoff at." (12) "Europe is overrun by political
and social masculine pygmies, barnacled with cat-like and beak-nosed feminine
appendages who add to the chaos by their drivelling chatter." (13)
Apparently the leading members of the Society for Psychical Research are to be
reckoned among the "mutton-headed imbeciles" and "masculine pygmies," for Mr.
Bradley expresses his "amazement at their lack of knowledge of the rudiments of
phenomena" and his "astonishment at the naive manner in which they exposed
their ignorance." (14) Moreover, of his son Pat, then seven years of age, who
wanted to be present at a seance, Mr. Bradley remarks that "since he is far more
intelligent in fundamental matters than the average member of Parliament, I saw
no reason to deny the gratification of his wishes." (15)
98
After these citations it is interesting to note that Mr. Bradley gravely disapproves
of Oscar Wilde's "colossal egoism," (16) and that he has cause of complaint against
his own friend Mr. De Wyckoff, who "in common with most financial magnates of
his calibre, is accustomed to his own way; and is intolerant of suggestion,
criticism and opposition." (17)
If I should appear to have been somewhat meticulous in accumulating these
characteristic utterances, (18) it is because the writer claims to be heard as a
philosopher and as a scientific expert in psychic matters. In fact, he declares that
"to be of value to the world it is necessary for spirit communication to be
developed to the highest plane of philosophical dignity, before it can hope to claim
universal acceptance by persons of intellect." (19) Is it unfair to suggest that philo-
sophical dignity is a quality which seems to be conspicuously lacking in the
volumes with which we are here concerned? The mentality revealed impresses one
as far removed from the philosophic temper. If this is the frame of mind
engendered by intercourse with the world beyond, the fact, I submit, would
already constitute a grave objection to the prosecution of such researches. The
dogmatism of the Churches which, after all, has behind it the tradition of nineteen
centuries and the adherence of countless generations of high-thinking Christians
who were among the most unselfish of mankind, is exchanged here for a
dogmatism based upon the supposed communications of "Dr. Barnett" and
"Johannes," whose very existence is incapable of proof.
I am not here questioning the reality of the phenomena which Mr. Bradley
chronicles. Without expressing any final opinion about a matter I am not in a
position to investigate, I am quite content to assume that on a single evening Mr.
Bradley and his guests have heard twenty different voices speak through the
trumpet or from space, that these voices were not fraudulently produced, that they
spoke in many different languages, including ancient Chinese, Basque and
idiomatic Welsh, which tongues, of course, were quite unknown to the medium, an
uneducated man, that there were often recognizable voices of those who had
recently passed over, preserving the tricks of manner and phrase which were
habitual in life, and that some of them disclosed matters which could have been
known to no one living, but which proved to be quite correct. Still, none of these
things, in my judgment, constitutes proof of the identity of the communicator. So
long as we suppose, what adherents of the movement commonly admit, that spirits
are all around us, and that what we may hide here in secrecy and darkness, is
known to thousands in the other world; so long as we have reason to believe from
the experience of skilled investigators, - such, for example, as Stainton Moses -
that personation is constantly attempted, we can never be sure that we are not
being tricked by some clever mimic in the world of shades.
Assuming for the nonce the truth of the ectoplasmic theory which is now favoured
by so many, one is tempted to ask whether it is only the discarnate spirit of the
dead man himself which can fashion his own semblance. If so, it is hard to see
why. Is it only he who can build up organs of speech to reproduce the tones of his
living voice? Is it only he who can so control the muscles of the automatist that the
script shows an exact imitation of the handwriting familiar in life? Were Mr. and
Mrs. Gladstone really floating in the air upside down, when Mr. Hope of Crewe, in
taking the photograph of Mr. Walter Wynn and his wife, obtained an "extra" or
99
spirit picture of the distinguished statesman and his consort in that unusual
position? Under the mediumship of Marthe Beraud (Eva C.) tiny adult faces often
appeared; was it only the spirits of those they represented that had the power to
mould them out of the ectoplasm? In Stainton Moses' still accessible sheaves of
script there are scores of different handwritings - in one of them, by the way, the
great Stagyrite purports to have signed his name Aristoteloj (!) - some of these
undoubtedly resemble the communicator's calligraphy, others do not. Are we to
take the resemblance as a test of authenticity?
My own conviction is, as I have previously argued elsewhere, that we can never
have conclusive proof of the identity of the spirit that purports to hold converse
from the other side. It would be easier to believe in its possibility in the case of
those recently deceased, but for such controls as Johannes, Dr. Barnett, Pheneas,
Phinuit, Imperator (who said he was the prophet Malachy), Rector (alleged to be
Hippolytus of Portus), Patience Worth and all the rest, I cannot persuade myself that
any trust can be reposed in their affirmations.
Now the special mischief which seems to me to be inherent in such works as those
of Sir A. C. Doyle and Mr. Bradley is the promise which they explicitly or implicitly
contain of wonders to come especially for those who will take pains to develop as
mediums. Mr. Bradley himself has developed as a medium, and has for some time past
obtained living-voice manifestations. Further, he has taught the Marquis Centurione
Scotto to develop on similar lines, and Light loudly proclaims his achievements. Lady
Doyle has also developed as a medium; just as the daughter of judge Edmonds did some
seventy-five years ago. But in spite of the thousands who were encouraged to do the
like in the United States in the middle of the last century, the movement led to no result.
Nothing whatever was added to the sum of human knowledge. Endless contradictory
messages were received, weird phenomena were witnessed and recorded, time beyond
calculation was wasted, but nobody was benefited. As we have already seen, within a
quarter of a century, all living interest in the cult collapsed.
We learn from Mr. Bradley that Mrs. Osborne Leonard, one of the most famous and
respected of modern mediums, holds that "most people could develop psychic powers of
some kind. It only needs patience and perseverance, and if possible the co-operation of
someone whom one has loved or who has passed over to the spirit side." And to this
Mr. Bradley adds on his own account that "there are tens of thousands possessing
mediumistic faculties which are undeveloped or which have been thwarted or knocked
out in youth." (20) Moreover, he teaches without disguise that "a thorough search should
be made for persons possessing mediumistic faculties. These persons should be fostered
and developed in the way best suited for the strengthening of their powers. Their
services should be utilized for the advancement of humanity in science, art, philosophy
and culture." (21)
Supposing that these exhortations took effect what would come of it?
Well, in the first place, if the Dr. Barnetts and Johanneses and Pheneases were
multiplied, it would inevitably lead to a very jumpy condition of nerves which would
not be very good for industry or the peace of the world. One of the most curious and
suspicious features of the communications from the other side recorded in Mr. Bradley's
two books is the attitude of all the controls to the subject of war. During 1917 and 1918
100
Mr. Bradley became conspicuous as a pacifist, and now all the messages he receives are
tuned to that note, just, I may add, as his known views on other subjects are strangely
given back to him by the spirits in the beyond. He probably holds that the sentiments
expressed from the other side about war, vivisection, sexual matters, capital
punishment, religion, etc., are made in emphatic terms because these views represent
the truth. His readers will suspect with good reason that these strong opinions are
only elicited by the tone of his own conscious or subconscious mind. Johannes, he
tells us in italics, "states deliberately that war is doubly criminal to murder,"
(22) developing the topic at considerable length. One has to know something of the
violence of Mr. Bradley's own views on the subject of war to appreciate the full
bearing of this coincidence.
At the same time it surely cannot tend to promote the spirit of peace, which he
considers so desirable, that Dr. Barnett and other controls abound in the most
gloomy forebodings regarding trouble ahead in the immediate future. For example,
what could be more likely to produce that panic in which the most brutal instincts
of mankind come into play than such an announcement as the following:
Dr. Barnett again gave a very grave warning about the secret preparations
of Japan and Germany for war in the air. On several occasions Dr. Barnett has
referred to this, and although any forecast is problematic, yet he insists on the
point that the next war will be comparatively soon and that it will be the most
terrible that human civilization has had to endure. (23)
As I ventured to urge recently in connection with much of the Great Pyramid
and British-Israel rubbish, these unverified and unverifiable prognostications of
calamity to come are in the highest degree pernicious. What, we may ask, would
Mr. Bradley have us do? After the pages he devotes to the denunciation of war and
his passionate indictment of the Churches for not condemning it, (24) one may
presume that he would not recommend as a remedy that England should set to
work building aeroplanes with even more feverish energy than Germany or Japan.
Nevertheless his book reverts to this danger many times over. For example, on
March 21, 1925, "Dr. Barnett went on to deal with war on this planet and spoke of
the possibility of a devastating war in the air between 1926 and 1927. England,
America, Japan, Germany, Russia and France might be involved," (25) and again,
"Dr. Barnett spoke of the terrible possibility of further wars in the very near
future. He said that Japan was building aeroplanes at a tremendous pace and in
very great numbers, and that the Japanese were preparing as fast as they could
for a great war in the air." (26) At a still earlier date the same control had
announced that there was "very great danger of another great war during the next
two years and only a universal spiritual movement can prevent it." (27) Apparently,
though very few of us are conscious of the fact, there must have been "a universal
spiritual movement"; for more than three years have passed and nothing has
happened so far.
The same tone is adopted by the control Warren Clarke, though his forebodings
of disaster turn rather upon catastrophes in the physical order. "There will be
storms, great storms, great winds and tidal waves. With the coming upheaval there
will be earthquakes in England and the great majority of the people will be
terrified; it will make their hair stand on end. "Warren Clarke goes on to say: "It
101
might be next year or within the next two years." (28) As this prophecy was made
on November 18, 1924, three and a half years have already expired and one would
think that we are justified in dismissing this peril from our minds. No earthquakes
have so far occurred in England which made people's hair stand on end. Perhaps
the spirits have again intervened and averted the blow. But can any sober-minded
person deny that the circulation of these alarmist rumours, if only from the point
of view of public polity, is much to be regretted? The only palliation can be that
probably very few people pay heed to them.
Still more disquieting is the prospect suggested by certain disclosures and
diatribes against living people, which seem to be a comparatively novel feature in
these communications from the other side. In the Oscar Wilde script, which came
to Mrs. Travers Smith some four or five years ago, there were many acrimonious
attacks on prominent men in the literary world. Mrs. Travers Smith took legal
advice and was informed that she certainly could not print these things without
exposing herself to an action for libel. More recently, in the various
communications recorded by Mr. Bradley, the same tendency is discernible. I am
not accusing him of making public things which ought not to be made public. But
the alarming feature in the case is the claim of the spirits to possess secret
knowledge of forgotten scandals and the readiness to impart that knowledge to
those who were previously in ignorance. Take the following incident from Mr.
Bradley's pages:
The spirit of Mrs. De Wyckoff's mother talked to her daughter.
THE SPIRIT: We are very disappointed in-
MRS. DEW.: Why?
THE SPIRIT: He told-'s wife that . . .
MRS. DE W.: I don't think he could have said that. How do you know?
THE SPIRIT: Because we heard him.
I am unable [adds Mr. Bradley] to give further particulars of the incident
referred to, other than to say that the statement had been made by an outside
person and had resulted in very unpleasant consequences. It was absolutely
startling to hear the confirmation and disclosure made by a spirit voice. I could
not restrain myself from shouting: "This is perfectly true. It is a scandalous
thing." (29)
He further tells us in a footnote that the name here suppressed was heard by
everybody in the room, and that "the dashes represent five words which were heard by
all and which referred to a fact that I alone knew." He does not seem to have
considered the possibility that it was from his own mind after all that the information
was derived; but obviously this remains a possibility.
Again, at a seance held with the medium Valiantine on March 7, 1925, Mr. Bradley
reports that his sister and Warren Clarke, both deceased, discussed hints of financial
102
irregularities, previously given, in which the full Christian and surname of a certain
person had been revealed, and he continues:
On the date of this sitting I was still continuing my investigation which had already
resulted in the disclosure of the embezzlement of tens of thousands of pounds. This
subtle and malevolent treachery, emanating from an unexpected quarter, had been
persistent, and might never have been discovered but for the communications I received
from my two great spirit friends. (30)
Now, while taking it for granted that this disclosure really did come from the other
world and was not suggested by some suspicion latent in Mr. Bradley's
subconsciousness, and while congratulating him on the fact that these criminal
defalcations were at last arrested, I cannot help asking whether, apart from the particular
case, this interference in human affairs by spirits from beyond the veil would not
introduce a terribly dangerous complication into life? (31)
Sir A. C. Doyle, the speakers in every Spiritualist meeting, and the writer we are
here discussing, proclaim in strident tones that in a few years Spiritualism will sweep all
before it. "Dr. Barnett" in February, 1924, declared that "great revelations would be
made in the near future and that a tremendous leap in human knowledge would take
place probably about 1926 or 1927." (32) In answer to the question "How long do you
think it will be before the Roman Catholic Church accepts Spiritualism?" the same
control affirmed that this would happen quite soon, (33) and Mr. Bradley himself reports
that "within this twentieth century the Roman Catholic Church will accept the fact of
direct spirit communication and will adapt her religious philosophy to embrace this
new discovery. '' (34) The picture presented in Sir A. C. Doyle's "Pheneas Speaks" and
the books before us is that of a world seeking guidance in all its daily affairs from the
spirits in the beyond, a world in which mediums are to be found in every street if not in
every family; a world, in fact, reproducing the conditions which existed in New
England seventy years ago before the movement collapsed. I confess that the
prospect does not fill me with enthusiasm, and more particularly for this reason,
that if those who have passed over take the course of ventilating their grievances
to their earth friends and of paying off old scores by revealing hidden scandals, the
atmosphere of harmony, which it is difficult enough to preserve at present, will
certainly not be enhanced.
Mr. Bradley will no doubt be shocked at the suggestion that his controls could
possibly convey false information or be animated by a malicious purpose, but,
after all, even Sir Arthur Doyle, who apparently believes that there are no
fraudulent mediums, will not dispute the existence of lying spirits, and if
communication becomes general in all classes of society, can anyone for a
moment suppose that all these undesirable communicators will be successfully
strained out? The prospect of a world, flooded with what I may call backstairs
gossip, to which vital importance is attached because each recipient believes that it
has come to him from on high in such a wonderful way, is not an attractive one.
Surely, anyone who seriously reflects must see that the difficulty is real.
But what perhaps affords even graver matter for consideration is the reflection
that the most prominent representatives of Spiritualism look forward to an era
103
when we shall take not only our facts, but our moral teaching from the guides who
address us from beyond the veil. "Pheneas" is presented to us in Sir A. C. Doyle's
record of his sittings in the domestic circle, as a most exalted personage,
possessing a wisdom which transcends the knowledge of man. "Dr. Barnett" and
"Johannes" seem to have inspired Mr. Bradley with an almost equal enthusiasm.
Of the former he tells us in one place: "Dr. Barnett was brilliant throughout the
sitting. It was, of course, never a question of argument with him. Each subject he
handled with determined knowledge. . . . His statements were made with the
unhesitating confidence of an intelligence above that of the human mind."
Of Johannes Mr. Bradley - apparently somewhat startled by the control's view
of the Deity that "He contains all in Himself, supreme in love, supreme in hate and
cruelty"-does indeed say, that "if we accept Johannes as a spirit of high
intelligence, even so there is no reason why we should accept his views as
infallible." (35) But he also is tremendously impressed by Johannes' wisdom and
fluency, and he remarks, "I have a great liking for the spirit of this intellectual
Jew." (36)
Now what are the moral standards towards which those who accept the
guidance of such controls as Johannes and Dr. Barnett are apparently tending? I
think I can best answer the question by making a few quotations. The passages
seem to me to speak for themselves and to render comment unnecessary. In a
sitting held under the mediumship of Mrs. Travers Smith in November, 1923, Mr.
Bradley put this question to Johannes:
Let us presume that during a man's lifetime he has physically and mentally
loved, either in marriage or without it, a plurality of women; always with
kindness and with a care that they should not suffer, in any preventable way,
for having loved him. By this I do not mean lovemaking in the promiscuous
animal sense, but I do mean completely with every sense. Is this regarded as an
offence or a foolishness for which he will be required to pay a penalty in his
after-life?
The reply of Johannes, somewhat too long to quote entire, takes the
following shape:
Not by any means. The explanation of this is very simple. It all comes from
the nature of the man. Some men are made like the strings of a lyre; they must
be played on by many fingers, which will bring out many different readings of
the music. . . . She, the woman, may suffer. . . . But if he cares for her, protects
her and gives her a certain portion of his mental part, he has done her no
wrong. . . . Over here no penalty awaits him except that his affinity is not yet
born as a single soul, and he must wait before the other half completes him. (37)
On this Mr. Bradley comments:
The prescribed code of the miserable and hypocritical rulers, which is
meekly accepted by the herd of fools, is that it is evil to love and be loved by a
woman in the sweetness of passionate ecstasy, that it is good to be "patriotic"
and blind and shatter human lives, and that it is right to blast the lives of
lovers. Such acceptances are despicable. They nauseate, sicken and revolt the
104
mind so that one walks through the world with a horrified contempt for the
human cattle who inhabit it. (38)
I hope I am not doing Mr. Bradley any injustice, but I confess that this sounds
to me uncommonly like the "Free Love" teaching which did so much to bring
about the collapse of the Spiritualist movement in the United States fifty years
ago. Moreover, it is difficult to retain any doubt as to Mr. Bradley's meaning when
we turn to other pages of the same book. For example, on p. 244 he asks Johannes
to "give his view of sex from the morality point of view." To which Johannes
replies: "My dear man, why should you, who seem to me a sane, even a wise
person, ask such a foolish question? There are no morals. Nothing is moral or
immoral, but there is wisdom and folly, and the mistaken use of sex on your planet
is merely a form of folly." Still earlier in the volume we find Mr. Bradley falling
foul of Sir A. C. Doyle over a similar question of sexual morality. The difference
of opinion arose apparently in consequence of some remarks contributed by Sir
Arthur to the Sunday Herald in 1923. I quote exactly from the text of "Towards
the Stars" (pp. 6o-61).
In the article in question [Mr. Bradley writes] Sir Arthur theorized on how
spiritualism might affect humanity. He asks: "How could a young man walk into
a house of ill-fame, if he knew that the spirit of his dead mother was walking by
his side"
To this Mr. Bradley objects:
Now that is intended to propound the decadent doctrine of the rule of fear. It
is a degrading argument, not only for the son, but for his mother's spirit, which
would surely possess the delicacy of oblivion to such scenes. This is dragging
Spiritualism down to a disgusting and inartistic level of thought. . . . This
miserable conception of the immortal spirit is frightful and wrong. To imagine
that its function is to pry upon our sordid lusts is the thought of a miserable
mind! If a spirit deigns to glance upon the pranks of human frailty, it is only to
smile in tolerance.
That the views on the essential wickedness of war and the harmlessness of
conjugal infidelity which purport to emanate from Johannes are merely the
reflection of Mr. Bradley's subconscious mind seems to me to be highly probable.
(39) He certainly does not disguise the low opinion in which he holds the female
sex. In his book "The Natural State" he writes as follows:
When enquiry is made whether men are naturally polygamous, it follows as a
corollary to ask whether women are polyandrous. The answer, so far as the
cities of Europe are concerned, is that the percentage of persons who are not so
inclined may be generously estimated as .01 percent [i.e., one in ten thousand].
Those who lift their hands in conventional horror at this decimal, do not
participate in these ideas by reason of fear or impotency. (40)
Such views would be less harmful if they were avowedly no more than the
extravagances of a free lance in revolt against the established moral code. But they
are often presented as the philosophy of an exalted being, "the great words spoken
105
and conceived by a higher intelligence than mine." (41) I fully recognize that Mr.
Bradley's principles would by no means be endorsed by all his fellow-spiritualists,
but, as indicated at the beginning of this chapter, he claims by implication that his
two volumes are the most epoch-making works which the cause has produced
since Spiritualism came into the world, and they certainly have been widely read.

However, it is perhaps only fair to notice that in Mr. Bradley's view: "It is useless to
give knowledge in whispering accents. To be understood nowadays it is necessary to
give some vulgar shout…. The arrogance of tone that I adopt is merely the usage of a
weapon with which to lash the herd to understanding." "Towards the Stars," pp. 161-
162.

HARRY PRICE – THE PSYCHIC DETECTIVE: -
Richard Morris’ new book “Harry Price- The Psychic Detective” (2006, Sutton
Publishing, £18.99 ISBN 0-7509-4271-1) was reviewed by Leslie Price in last
month’s newsletter1
. Richard Morris responds: -
Dear Paul
In Leslie Price’s even-handed review of my biography about Harry Price he said that
in the book I don’t always draw the obvious conclusion and cites the cases of William
Hope and Rudi Schneider.
First off, I concluded that Price faked evidence against Rudi because of the strong
evidence in favour of it. I’m not so sure whether he faked evidence in the Hope case
but it seems likely. I wrote that although Harry stated that he passed the supposedly
faked plate to an independent photographer to develop they were in fact developed by
one of Harry’s close friends, Charles Reginald Haines. Haines was also implicated in
Price’s attempt at passing off fake antiquities and a staged robbery at a village church
in the 1920s.
My statements regarding Stella Cranshaw having had an abortion followed on from
careful analysis of her letters, Price’s replies, her medical condition and her sudden
switches of behaviour – which 3 independent psychologists said were symptomatic of
some type of deep trauma. The pregnancy and abortion are supposition, but my duty,
as Price’s biographer, was to work out why Stella may have acted in the way she did.
My conclusions were based on her close relationship with Price and his subsequent
relationship with other women.
Yours faithfully
Richard Morris

SPIRITUALISM IN MODERN JAPAN
By Mr. W. Asano
(President, Japanese Society for Psychic Science)
You all know that the Restoration of Japan in 1868 marked an epoch in Japanese
history. It gave birth to New Japan, and severed it entirely from Old Japan.. The old
Japan was the world of tradition and conservatism, where sentiment prevailed over
reason, and the traditional faiths were readily accepted. The people of Old Japan took
in without question Shintoism, which popularly is ancestor worship, or Buddhism
somewhat modified to suit Japanese life. Secure from any foreign influence, they
were leading a peaceful but rather a simple life. If propagated at that time,
Spiritualism would have found a smooth paved way before it, for in fact almost all
Japanese people of that time might be called Spiritualists.
Some might say "The Japanese people are pantheists, as other peoples in the Orient,
and because of their lack of faith in the Supreme Being they can not in a true sense be
called Spiritualists." This is a mistake. Briefly speaking, the Japanese people have
such faith as may at the same time be called pantheism as well as monotheism. For
the highest symbol of worship of Shintoism, Amenominakanushino-kami (god ruling
the inmost centre of heaven), means nothing but God in Christianity, Bhutatathatu in
Buddhism, and Heaven in Confucianism; in other words, it is the Infinite Intelligence
of the Universe. Other objects of the Japanese worship, Yaoyorozunokamigami
(million gods), signify mainly the ancestral or inner beings.
Spiritualism had thus been a dominating force for centuries in the old Japan until it
lost its hold upon the people's minds on the national change created by the Meiji
Restoration, when the western civilisation flooded the country. The material progress
made in Europe and America over a considerable length of time was then a revelation
to the undeveloped mind of the old Japanese people. Awakened from a long lethargy,
they rushed headlong to take in the new material civilisation, giving up without stint
everything old, regardless of its value, and things pertaining to spirit were sadly put
aside for some time. The marvellous development made in Japan during these fifty
years in every field of scientific knowledge and various phases of social organisation
is really incomparable with the history of any other nation under the sun.
Through those frantic efforts, Japan could, as far as material civilisation is concerned,
now rank with the great powers of the world; but from the spiritual point of view it
has come to bear the aspect of a wild and barren land. Spiritualism, which is still
exposed to severe criticism and treated with disdain in various directions, even in
Europe and America, would find many more difficulties in Japan, where the Govern-
ment are absolutely heedless of the subject, and no interest is taken in it either by
109
religionists or scientific men. It is no wonder, therefore, if the general public remain
quite indifferent to any spiritual movement going on in the West.
There is, however, no question that the people cannot long be left in such an unnatural
and absurd condition. When they paid no attention to the existence of spirits, the latter
seemed to be working to influence them from the other world; this is presumable from
the fact that during these fifty years many powerful mediums appeared and kept the
people well puzzled over various psychic phenomena they produced. I am now going
to name a typical one of these mediums, and will speak very briefly about her life.
Miss TOSIE OSANAMI The psychic faculty Miss Osanami possessed was not the
result of hard training it was born in her. Physically, she was well developed and
healthy as well as beautiful in form. She was abstemious in her diet, which consisted
mainly of water and little raw fruit. Everything she took had to be raw; even a cup of
warm water, when heated artificially, was immediately vomited.
The recognition of Miss Osanami as a powerful medium was established among her
family and friends in 1892, and from that time until 1907, when she died at the age of
forty-five, she was noted as such by people around her. She possessed very strong and
varied mediumistic faculties. I will relate now some of the abnormal phenomena
produced by her.
1. Prophetic Faculty. Miss Osanami could always give in a condition not appearing to
be deep trance a ready and clear answer to any question put to her even on things
occurring in the future. Her prophecy of the China-Japanese War in 1893 was a well-
known fact among a group of people at that time.
2. Aerial Music. While in trance, very often there was heard in the air far above her
head an exquisite music, in which the sounds of a flute, a sort of flageolet and harp
and also of a bell were harmoniously mingled. The phenomenon was believed to be
the sign of the approach of gods, and it was said that many times the gaolers were
surprised by it, while she was detained at the Turugaoka jail under the suspicion of
fraud.
3. Phenomena of Apports. She also showed a marvellous power in furnishing books,
charms, medicines and various other objects to those who asked her for such apports.
I would illustrate as the record-breaking phenomenon her remarkable power in
producing liquid medicine within empty glass bottles.
Her patients would come to ask for medicine, and bring their own bottles. These were
put together on a table placed in front of her family shrine. She would then kneel
down before it and offer prayer of the Shinto rite for about ten minutes. When the
prayer was ended they would see those empty bottles filled up at once with liquid of
different colours. The colour of the medicine differed according to the nature of
illness; red, blue, yellow, orange, etc. Sometimes as many as forty bottles would be
filled at one time.
Such phenomena occurring every day made her the talk of the gossips in Turugaoka
City of Akita Prefecture, where she was twice put to prison as an impostor. The
phenomena even took place during her imprisonment, and she was finally acquitted
110
on the ground of insufficient evidence. In the spring of 1900 she removed to Osaka,
where she stayed at her brother's. Here, her abnormal powers were described in the
Osaka Asahi [newspaper – PP), and once more she had to undergo the interference of
the police. Accused of being a swindler, she was tried in the District Court of Kobe.
In the Court of justice, however, before the judge and other judicial officers, she
succeeded in producing as usual some brown liquid medicine within an empty bottle,
sealed tight. This, of course, made everybody present speechless with astonishment,
and she was consequently acquitted on the spot. She died in November, 1907, and her
remains were buried in her native province, where a small shrine now stands to
celebrate her.
This record clearly shows that behind the materialistic and worldly garment of new
Japan there still remained the spiritual element of old Japan, which was well
illustrated in the abundant abnormal phenomena occurring from ancient times
throughout the country, and on account of which the people were proud of the empire,
calling it "the land of gods". It seems, therefore, that the rather indifferent attitude of
Japanese people towards Spiritualism for the past half a century was partly a reaction
from the blind belief of old days and was also attributable to the radical change that
required for a time all the attention of the people to the material side of things.
Whatever the reason, it is evident that Spiritualism in present Japan has no solid
foundation, and in systematic study of it Japan is regrettably far behind England,
France, America, and other countries. The first organised body of Spiritualists of new
Japan appeared in Tokyo about thirty years ago under the name of "Shinshokai". The
founders of the society were Mr. K. Matumura and Dr. S. Miyake and other well-
known scholars and religionists of that time. They published an organ of the society,
which did not last more than a few years. Prof. T. Fukurai, of the Tokyo Imperial
University, then took up his solitary study of the subject.
Prof. Fukurai was first interested in the study of hypnotism and gradually turned his
keen attention to psychic phenomena. He made an extensive study of clairvoyance
with such mediums as Mrs. Nagao, Miss Mifune, Mrs. Takahashi, Mr. Mita, who
were all well known for their remarkable psychic faculties among the Spiritualists.
These mediums were put to very severe tests, and many precise and trustworthy
records were taken by Prof. Fukurai to prove their genuineness as clairvoyants. But
the ignorant and prejudiced public of that time could not believe in psychic pheno-
mena. Prof. Fukurai had, consequently, to stand the most unsympathetic attitude
among his co-workers in the university and severe criticism in newspapers and
magazines, and was finally forced to leave the chair in 1911. This unhappy event
caused the miserable death of the two mediums, Mrs. Nagao and Miss Mifune, and
checked the growth of the study of Spiritualism in new Japan until 1923, when a
powerful new society was organised in Tokyo to pursue the study of psychic
phenomena. This organisation is the Society for Psychic Science which I am now
leading.

THE HARBINGER OF LIGHT
_____________________________
DEATH OF MR. JOHN TYERMAN
[Note by Psypioneer: - We are grateful to Elizabeth Kennedy of Auckland New
Zealand who has provided us with a copy of the obituary for Mr. Tyerman which
appeared in Harbinger of Light, December 1 1880. This provides information not
present in the biographical article we published last month.2
]
OUR readers will regret to hear of the sudden departure from amongst us of the above
energetic apostle of Spiritualism and Freethought who passed to the higher life, from
Sydney, on Saturday last.
Mr. Tyerman was lecturing in Melbourne during the early part of November, but
finding his health giving way, and fearing a serious illness, he determined to return
home, and left for Sydney on the 15th ult. He wrote from Sydney on the 20th, stating
he was better, and no anxiety was felt on his account. The reception of the telegram
conveying the news of his decease naturally created a sensation amongst those who
were made cognizant of it, and sincere regret was manifest by many who knew him.
The first public announcement of the event was made in the Lyceum on Sunday
morning by Mr. Terry, who after briefly reviewing his career as a public man, paid a
tribute to his energy and industry in the advancement of Freethought and Spiritualism
during the last decade.
Mr. Tyerman, who was an ordained minister of the Wesleyan Church, in New
Zealand, came to Victoria about eleven years since, bringing introductions to the then
Bishop of Melbourne (Dr. Perry) who placed him, on probation, in charge of the
Church of England, Kangaroo Flat. Between this and the period appointed for his
induction, several of his congregation became in interested in Spiritualism, and some
being convinced, seceded from the Church. Mr. Tyerman, not wishing to condemn it
without examination, determined to investigate for himself; the result being that
instead of discovering its error, he became seriously impressed with its truths. His
proceedings being reported to the Dean, he was catechised by that dignitary, and his
answers not being deemed satisfactory, was suspended. He appealed to the public of
Sandhurst, the Theatre being crowded to hear his justification, and shortly afterwards
visited Melbourne, giving his first public address there in November 1871.
In the early part of the following year he was engaged by the Victorian Association
of Spiritualists and lectured for them at the Masonic, Turn Verein and St. George's
Halls till the close of that year, during the same period he had a public discussion
extending over three days with Mr David Blair, ably maintaining his position and
vindicating the truths of Spiritualism to the entire satisfaction of that body. In the
following year he founded the Spiritualist and Freethought Propagandist Association
and was elected the first president, in November of the same year he started a weekly
paper, entitled the Progressive Spiritualist and Freethought Advocate, it was carried
on with spirit for about nine months when it collapsed for want of funds. In the
2
http://www.woodlandway.org/PDF/PP3.4April07..pdf
112
following year he visited Sydney and lectured there, and was subsequently engaged as
the permanent lecturer of the Spiritualists and Freethinkers of that city where be
continued to lecture in the principal theatre for a period of two years, excepting the
time employed in a visit to Brisbane where he delivered a short but successful course
of lectures. In 1877, hard mental work began to tell upon his brain, and he was
compelled to abandon the platform, the medical men of that city telling him he would
not be able to resume it. He came to Melbourne, and placed himself under the
treatment of the writer, who told him that with the aid of magnetism his brain power
would be restored. Mr. Singleton undertook his treatment in this direction; the result
being that in three months be was able to resume his ministrations. It had been the
object of his ambition to make a tour of the world, and in 1878, circumstances
favouring its accomplishment, he left for America, staying a month to lecture at
Auckland on the way.
He lectured successfully at San Francisco and Boston, and was highly eulogised as
a public speaker at the latter city, his principal lecture (on Immortality) being reported
in full by the Banner of Light, and subsequently published in pamphlet form. He
afterwards lectured in London and the provinces, creating a most favourable
impression, and returned to Sydney in 1879 to find his platform filled by Mr. Charles
Bright. There not being room for two permanent lecturers in that city, Mr. Tyerman
paid a visit to Adelaide, and broke ground there. Subsequently he visited Dunedin,
and lectured for the Freethinkers of that city, and prior to the burning of the Victoria
Theatre at Sydney, gave a successful course of lectures there. Overtures had recently
been made to him to visit Queensland, and it was his intention to have made a tour
from Brisbane to Townsville and Charters Towers, which his untimely departure will
frustrate.
Mr. Tyerman was a rational, energetic, and consistent worker in the fields of free
religious thought and Spiritualism; and in addition to his platform labours, wrote a
number of books and pamphlets, some of which have run through several editions, his
last publication being a noble vindication of Freethought. He leaves a wife and several
children who, through the naturally precarious circumstances of his work and income,
are unprovided for. We trust, therefore, that some effort will be made by those who
appreciate his work to help those be has left behind, and thereby pay a tribute both
graceful and practical to his memory.

Spiritualism, Psychical Research, and Nineteenth Century Discussions of Apparitions,
1813-1879. However, the reader should be aware that there are overlapping interests.
I have emphasized books over articles. In addition, the reader should be aware that the
publications listed below are but a selection from the many other works also available
in the database.
Mesmerism
The holdings include a volume of the Zoist (Vol 7, March 1849-January
1850), as well as Deleuze’s Instruction Pratique sur le Magnétisme Animal (1836),
Esdaile’s Natural and Mesmeric Clairvoyance (1852), and Haddock’s Somnolism &
Psycheism (1851). The latter includes accounts of the clairvoyance of a subject named
Emma, while in his book Animal Magnetism and Magnetic Lucid Somnambulism
(1866), Lee discussed the gifts of Alexis Didier. Later books representing the neo-
mesmeric movement include those of Baraduc (1904) and Chazarain and Declé

The collection has much information about specific fascinating figures of the past.
One of them was Andrew Jackson Davis. Some of his books listed below include The
Great Harmonia (1850-1861), A Stellar Key to Summerland (1868), Memoranda of
Persons, Places, and Events (1868), and The Principles of Nature (1871). In the first
volume of The Great Harmonia (1850) Davis discussed health, disease, sleep,
psychology, and healing. There is also information about Carl Baron von
Reichenbach, and his work with the Od force. An anonymous reviewer in the Eclectic
Review (1851) stated that Reichenbach’s work “opens a new era in natural history, as
well as in the history of the human mind.” The database has two of his books:
Physico-Physiological Researches on the Dynamics of Magnetism, Electricity, Heat,
Light, Crystallization, and Chemism, and their Relation to Vital Force (1850), and
Somnambulism and Cramp (1860).

Spiritualism and Spiritism
The collection has several early books on the subject. Rogers influential Philosophy of
Mysterious Agents (1853) discussed concepts of force that did not require the
intervention of spirits, a topic also discussed in several other works such as Brittan
and Richmond’s A Discussion of the Facts and Philosophy of Ancient and Modern
Spiritualism (1853), which presented debates between the authors as to the
explanation of spiritualistic phenomena. Carpenter (1877) focused on conventional
explanations, such as expectation and automatic nervous phenomena. Others defended
discarnate agency, among them the French spiritists Kardec (1860), and Delanne
(1897). Two very important and influential books were Edmonds and Dexter
Spiritualism (1853), and De Gasparin’s Des Tables Tournantes (1854), published in
the United States and in France, respectively. The collection includes a volume of
Brittan’s Journal of Spiritual Science, Literature, Art, and Inspiration (1874, 2), and
of the Spiritual Magazine (1862, 3; 1868, 3[n.s]; 1869, 4[n.s.]).

Psychical Research
The collection includes many early classics such as Crookes’ Researches in
the Phenomena of Spiritualism (1874), Flournoy’s Des Indes à la Planète Mars
(1900), and Myers’ Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death (1903).
117
Reviews and discussions of late nineteenth-century ESP and theoretical attempts to
explain the phenomena were presented in Ochorowicz’s Mental Suggestion (1891)
and in Podmore’s Apparitions and Thought-Transference (1894). While Bell (1904)
and Lodge (1920) included much material about American medium Leonora E. Piper,
Flammarion (1909) and Lombroso (1909) did the same for Italian medium Eusapia
Palladino. There is also much about mediumship in the books by Flournoy (1911),
Hyslop (1919), and Maxwell (1905). A few issues of the Proceedings and Journal of
the Society for Psychical Research and the American Society for Psychical Research
are also available in the database (JSPR, 1887-1890, 3-4, 1901-1904, 10-11; PSPR,

Nineteenth-Century Discussions of Apparitions, 1813-1879
There were many important studies of apparitions conducted by the SPR, such as the
last reference listed above. In addition, there is a considerable previous literature on
the topic, as well as studies of hallucinations. Several authors compiled cases of
apparitions, such as Catherine Crowe’s The Night–Side of Nature (1850), which also
summarized ideas of German students of the subject, such as Jung-Stilling in his
Theory of Pneumatology (1834). Several other collections include Jarvis’ Accredited
Ghost Stories (1823), Day’s Remarkable Apparitions, and Ghost-Stories (1848),
Calmet’s The Phantom World (1850), and Harrison’s Spirit Before Our Eyes (1879).
While most of the above mentioned authors were disposed to accept apparitions as
spiritual phenomena of different sorts, others, such as Brierre de Boismont (1855),
argued for conventional hallucinatory explanations.
Other examples of this literature include the works of Ferriar (1813), Hibbert (1825),
Newnham (1830), and Clarke (1878).
