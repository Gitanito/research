They opened my chest, connected an external circulation of blood, and made my heart to stop; my aorta artery was replaced over a large portion with a Dacron prosthesis.

During the procedure (about six hours), I felt perfectly well, and suddenly, I saw a bright white light, which had the shape of a galaxy, and was turning in an anti-clockwise direction. It lasted quite a long time I think, but how could I measure the length of time. This light was composed of the energy (souls?) of disappeared Beings; it was, somehow, paradise, but where individuals were inseparable. However, a great joy emanated from the whole thing, a total wellbeing, nothing bothering, and I wanted to stay there for eternity; I was part of that sort of galaxy, but at the same time, I was an outside spectator. 

Then, everything disappeared, much to my regret. Maybe when my heart was restarted. I do not know.
