He is noted in particular for his participation the Naples investigation of the physical medium Eusapia Palladino.&nbsp;A large collection of his writings and correspondence is held in the Princeton University library.

Hereward Hubert Lavington Carrington was born on 17 October 1880 in St. Helier, Jersey and attended school in London and Kent.1 &nbsp;He visited the USA in 1888 and later moved to Boston before settling in New York City in 1904, where he worked as an assistant editor for Street and Smith magazines.

Carrington became interested in psychical research after encountering books on the subject, joining the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in 1899 and the American Society for Psychical Research in 1907. He was chiefly interested in physical phenomena of poltergeists and mediumship, and is said to have sat with almost every prominent physical medium of the time, both in the UK and elsewhere. He is best known for his in-depth report of an investigation of Eusapia Palladino, which decisively endorsed at least some of the observed phenomena as genuine (see below).

Carrington founded the American Psychical Institute and Laboratory in New York in 1921 which closed after two years, but was re-opened ten years later.

Carrington was a consultant for The Mysteries of Myra, a fifteen-episode silent film series released in 1916, which introduced various paranormal concepts. &nbsp;He is said to have been the model for Payson Alden, the psychical investigator in the films.2  Mediumship

An extensive knowledge of conjuring made Carrington sceptical about the claims of séance mediums. His 1920 book The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism, Fraudulent and Genuine gives detailed descriptions of tricks that he argued were used by mediums such as Henry Slade, the Eddy brothers and William Eglinton to deceive scientists and spiritualists.3 &nbsp;However, a shorter section describes mediums he considered to be genuine, notably DD Home, William Stainton Moses and Eusapia Palladino.

In 1908 Carrington, with fellow SPR researchers Everard Feilding and WW Baggally, carried out an investigation of Palladino in a hotel in Naples. Contrary to the results of an earlier investigation held in 1895 in Cambridge, which concluded she was entirely fraudulent, the trio became convinced that much of the phenomena they observed could not be accounted for by such tricks as she undoubtedly often used. In particular, Carrington noted, the more stringent their precautions the stronger the effects became. Carrington also commented on the psychological barriers to conviction that the investigators experienced, and which had hitherto been underestimated.4

Keen to show Palladino to an American audience, Carrington acted as her manager in a tour of US cities in 1910, which, however, led to accusations of cheating that damaged her reputation.5&nbsp;

For a full assessment, see Eusapia Palladino.

Carrington later took part in a long-running investigation of the American medium Mina Crandon (Margery), who likewise convinced him of the genuineness of the observed phenomena. However, he is also said to have admitted carrying on an affair with her, which sceptics argue may have affected this judgement.6 See Margery (Mina Stinson Crandon)

Starting in 1932 Carrington undertook experiments with the Irish clairvoyant medium Eileen Garrett, aiming by the use of word association and other tests to establish whether ‘Uvani’, her ‘control’, could be considered to be an entity independent of her. Significant variation was found in eleven out of a hundred stimulus words, sufficient to convince Carrington but not Garrett herself.

A visit to the Lily Dale Assembly spiritualist camp in New York convinced him that all seventeen of the mediums working there were fraudulent.7

Considering research carried out with the clairvoyant medium Leonora Piper,8 Carrington opposed James Hyslop, who considered it to be strong evidence of survival, adopting instead an explanation in terms of secondary personalities and telepathy among the living. Carrington accepted that Piper’s ability to demonstrate knowledge of facts unknown to the sitter might be considered a major obstacle. However, he argued that this could be accounted for if people are unknowingly able to obtain knowledge telepathically from others.  Out-of-Body Experience

In the 1920s Carrington collaborated on two books with Sylvan Muldoon, who described frequent occurrences of out-body-experiences, or what they called ‘astral projection’. The second of these, The&nbsp;Phenomena of Astral Projection,9 has become a classic and is described fully here.  Works  Books
