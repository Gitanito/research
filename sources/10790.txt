After weighing me the nurse told me that the doctor wanted to take off six kilos. I said that I was already dry and challenged his request.  I was thirty minutes into the treatment and happened to be eating my lunch at the time. I remember starting to pass out and calling for the nurse. In the next instant, I was in a place, a garden, with the most incredible array of brilliantly colored flowers. There I met my mother who was deceased and another figure whom I did not recognize, the feeling of warmth and peace was as I had only experienced once before in a meditation. There was a feeling of timelessness and comfort that I cannot explain, but I do recall that when I came to I wanted so badly to go back to that place. From what the nurses told me I was out for less than a minute. But in reality time is an illusion.

Did scenes from your past come back to you?      My past flashed before me, out of my control

Did scenes from the future come to you?      No

Did you come to a border or point of no return?      No

God, Spiritual and Religion:

What was your religion prior to your experience?   Moderate   apathetic I have investigated many religions and read much about the religions of the world

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?      No

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?     No   Dialysis treatment.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?      No

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?       Having to come back to my sick body.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?    Yes    My family members think I am crazy anyway but my friends were accepting of my experience.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?    No

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?      In May I will be six years post-transplant and know that I do not have near the answers that I would like to have regarding life.  I do think now that when I am critical of others I immediately look at my own shortcomings and try to be more tolerant and accepting.
