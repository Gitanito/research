PREFACE
The growing public interest in Evolution has ren­
dered it desirable to summarise the comprehensive
Oriental system outlined in The Secret Doctrine by
Helena P. Blavatsky. The work itself, although in
steadily increasing demand, is too bulky and abstruse
for the general public. The remarkable evolutionary
scheme, both cosmic and human, which it unfolds, how­
ever, is contained in a comparatively small number of
Stanzas from the Archaic Records, translated by the
author with full explanatory commentaries, and a great
quantity of comparative and confirmatory material
from both Eastern and Western sources.
In order to present as clear an idea as the nature
of the subject permits, these explanations have been
reduced to the simplest possible proportions, with the
addition of notes and diagrams. Since this monumental
work was first published in 1888, scientific discoveries
have been made which confirm or approximate to
many of its statements and teachings. I have there­
fore summarised these at their appropriate places for
the reader’s information.
Moreover, the apparently unbridgeable gulf existing
at that period between Science and Mysticism has
grown steadily smaller, until to-day one of our most
distinguished astronomers and physicists, Professor
Eddington of Cambridge University, asks:
“Are we, in pursuing the mystical outlook, facing
the hard facts of experience? Surely we are. I
think that those who would wish to take cognisance
II
of nothing but the measurements of the scientific
world, made by our sense org-ans, are shirking one of
the most immediate facts of experience, namely, that
consciousness is not wholly, nor even primarily, a de­
vice for receiving sense impressions. We may the
more boldly insist that there is another outlook than
the scientific one, because in practice a more trans­
cendental outlook is almost universally admitted”
(Swarthmore Lecture to the Society of Friends,
London, 1929).
“Reduce everything to terms of consciousness”
said H.P. Blavatsky to her pupils. /fUse your key of
analogy and correspondences. Everything in the
Universe follows analogy. As above, so below.” It is
in this spirit that we may look forward to a fairer
and more impartial consideration of the Oriental
Archaic System, which, as H. P. Blavatsky points out,
is, after all, the result of observation and study by
countless generations of seers or mystic philosophers,
trained in the higher powers of consciousness which
afford that “transcendental outlook” on which Pro­
fessor Eddington insists in actual practice.
Another eminent astronomer, Sir James H. Jeans,
asks the startling question: “Are the stars, per­
chance, a dream, while we are brain-cells in the mind
of the dreamer?” And he estimates that “the human
race has a future that must be measured by at least
a million million years” (Astronomy and Cosmogony,
1929). To which the Secret Doctrine quite logically
adds a past of like extent. Such ideas would have been
laughed to scorn only a few years ago; yet they are
quite in line with what will be found in the ensuing
pages, and more, far more, in the work itself.. “Wq
have turned a corner in the path of progress,” says
Eddington in The Nature of the Physical World, “and
our ignorance stands revealed before us, appalling
and insistent.”
Ill
Dr. Henry Fairfield Osborn, America’s leading
palaeontologist, testifies to the intense public interest
in the question of Human Ancestry. His address on
the Tertiary Dawn Man, as a substitute for what he
calls “the outworn Ape-Man theory”, brought him
clippings from the religious and lay press of all coun­
tries. “In fact,” he says, “we have all borne with the
monkey and ape hypothesis long enough and are glad
to welcome this new idea of the aristocracy of man
going back to an even more remote period than the
beginning of the Stone Age.” (Broadcast on “Dis­
covery of the Dawn Man”, Feb., 1930). But Dr»
Osborn went further than this, in concluding the
address he refers to: “To my mind,” he said, “the
human brain is the most marvellous object in the
whole universe and no geologic period seems too long
to allow for its natural evolution” (Address of the
retiring president of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, Des Moines, December
27, 1929).
This mystery, so strongly emphasised by Pro­
fessor Drummond in his Ascent of Man (1897), is
explained in the Secret Doctrine by a triple evolution,
Spiritual-Mental-Physical, in man alone. The element
of Mind is shown to be the product of previous cycles
of evolution, which, entering the physical form of man
in the Secondary Age of this cycle, made him a think­
ing and speaking self-conscious being before he begot
in the Tertiary the ancestors of the apes as an ac­
cidental by-product which was not in the evolutionary
scheme. The “brain” of man, then, which is still a
mystery for the Western scientist, is, from the
Oriental standpoint, only the instrument of a de­
veloped Ego. For, as the great Indian scientist Sir
Jagadish Bose, says: “India’s great thinkers, the
Rishis, still have the Sannyasin spirit which utterly
IV
controls the body and can meditate or inquire end­
lessly while life remains, never for a moment losing
sight of the object or letting it be obscured by any
terrestrial temptation... .We often forget that the
real laboratory is one’s own mind. The room and the
instruments only externalise that. Every experiment
has first to be carried out in that inner region. To
keep the mental vision clear great struggles have to
be undergone” (“Discoveries and Writings”, pp. 39,
, 70).
The future, then, is full of promise. IT. P.
Blavatsky, “that great path-breaker in the wilderness
of a Paradise debased,” has put the Master Key into
our hands. It is our own fault if,through ignorance,
prejudice, or indifference we fail to use it. “In the
twentieth century,” she writes in her Introduction,
“scholars will begin to recognise that the Secret Doc­
trine has neither been invented nor exaggerated, but,
on the contrary simply outlined; and finally, that its
teachings antedate the Vedas.”

INTRODUCTION.
The Secret Doctrine establishes three funda­
mental propositions:
(а) An Omnipresent, Eternal, Boundless, and
Immutable Principle on which all speculation is
impossible. This Infinite and Eternal Cause—dimly
formulated in the “Unconscious” and “Unknowable’
of current European philosophy—is the Rootless
Root of “all that was, is, or ever shall be.” It is
“Be-ness” rather than Being (in Sanskrit, Sat) ,
symbolised under two aspects: Abstract Space and
Abstract Motion.
(б) The Eternity of the Universe in toto as
a boundless plane, periodically “the playground of
numberless Universes incessantly manifesting and
disappearing.”
(c) The fundamental identity of all Souls
with the Universal Over-Soul, the latter itself being
an aspect of the Unknown Root; and the obligatory
pilgrimage for every Soul—a spark of the former—
through the Cycle of Incarnation (or “Necessity”)
in accordance with Cyclic and Karmic Law during
the whole term.
The history of Cosmic Evolution, as traced in
the Stanzas of Dzyan, is, so to say, the abstract
algebraical formula of the Evolution. It can be
applied, mutatis mutandis, to all evolution: to that
of our tiny Earth; to that of the Septenary chain of
planets of which that Earth forms one; to the Solar
VI
Universe to which that chain belongs, and so on, in
an ascending scale, till the mind reels, and is
exhausted in the effort.
The Seven Stanzas given in Part I represent the
seven terms of this abstract formula. They refer
to and describe the seven great stages of the evolu­
tionary process, which are spoken of in the Purdnas
as the “Seven Creations,” and in thei Bible as the
“Days” of Creation.
The Twelve Stanzas given in Part II outline the
development of Man, from his first appearance on
this Earth in this Bound to the state in which we
now find him. A “Round” is one of seven circuits of
the planetary chain.
In each case only the modern translated version
is given, as it would be worse than useless to make
the subject more difficult by introducing the archaic
phraseology of the original, with its puzzling style
and words. Extracts are given from the Chinese,
Tibetan and Sanskrit translations of the original
Senzar Commentaries and glosses on the Book of
Dzyan, these being rendered for the first time into
a European language. Dzyan is the Tibetan form of
the Sansl^ Dhyan or Jndna (Guyana), and the
Chinese Ch’an the wisdom or higher knowledge
obtained by trained meditation in the esoteric
schools of that name. It is also written Dzyn, Dzen,
or Zen (as in Zen Buddhism).
Senzar is the mystic name for the secret
sacerdotal language or the “Mystery-Speech” of the
Initiated Adepts all over the world. The forefathers
of the Toltecs understood it as easily as the inhabit­
ants of the lost Atlantis, who inherited it in their
turn from the Sages of the Third Root Race
(Lemurians), who learnt it direct from the Devas of
the Second and First Races, the Divine Progenitors,
VII
who are progressed Egos from previous cycles of
evolution on other planets.
The dispassionate reader cannot; fail to be
struck with the fact that the Secret Doctrine pre­
sents the only attempt at a logical system of Human
evolution in a septenary series1of great Root Races
and Continents, which are in strict correspondence
with the whole septenary scheme of the Solar Sys­
tem and the 'Universe. Western Science, while it
has now proved the truth of the Oriental doctrine
that the atom is a microcosm of the macrocosm—a
miniature solar system—and thereby has broken
down the materialism of nineteenth century Physics,
has got no further in Anthropology than a classifica­
tion based on the fossil remains of some of the more
primitive peoples. Even in this there is considerable
disagreement and some prejudice, as the following
extract from an article on the “Springbok” man of
South Africa by Dr. Robert Broom, F. R. S., shows:
Sixty years ago the famous Collyer jaw was got in a
very old deposit in Norfolk. It was examined by all the
eminent scientists of the day, but, as it was not of a typical
monkey type and had a pointed chin, Science threw it in the
waste-paper basket. The Galley Hill skull seemed quite cer­
tainly of great antiquity; but, alas it had a large brain and
a pointed chin. So to-day anthropologists regard it with
suspicion. )
In the past, anthropologists have not been entirely free
from blame. They have assumed, without any satisfactory
evidence, that a skull with a large brain and a pointed eliin
is not likely to be old, and almost invariably when such a
skull has been found, even though its credentials seemed to
be thoroughly satisfactory, the anthropologists would have
none of it. In 1863 a pointed jaw was got at Moulin Quignon,
in France. It was found associated with mammoth teeth and
old stone axes, but, as it was of what is called the “modern
type,” it was discarded, and is now forgotten. ,-;i
That western science has hitherto declined to
recognise the Oriental doctrines is scarcely surpris­
VIII
ing when we recall that the Royal Society refused
recognition to the great Indian scientist Sir Jagadish
Bose for twenty years. In 1901 he demonstrated
before that body his discoveries of the universal
sensitivity of matter, and that life reactions of plants
'were similar to those of animals. At p. 113 of his
“Life, Discoveries, and Writings” (Natesan and Co.,
Madras) he says:
My physicist friends were puzzled by my incursion into
the field with which they were less familiar, and the physiolo­
gists present resented my intrusion into their preserve. I
had evidently offended the etiquette of an unfamiliar caste
system, and I was roundly told to keep to my trade. The re­
sult was that my communication was for the first time refused
publication by the Royal Society.
It should be pointed out that the Stanzas, as
printed by themselves at the beginning of each
volume of The Secret Doctrine, contain a few errors.
These were corrected when H.P.B. came to deal with
each verse separately in her commentaries; more­
over, she added missing or elucidatory words in
parentheses which help the sense in the more
obscure passages.
Regarding this, she says in a footnote to Stanza
I, Vol. II, which applies equally to Vol. I:
All the words and, sentences placed in brackets in the
Stanzas and Commentaries are the writer’s. In some places
they may be incomplete and even inadequate from the Hindu
standpoint; but in the meaning attached to them in Trans-
Himalayan Esotericism they are correct. In every case the
writer takes any blame upon herself. Having never claimed
personal infallibility, that which is given on her own authority
may leave much to be desired, in the very abstruse cases
whei'o too deep metaphysic is involved. The teaching is offered
as it is understood; and as there are Seven Keys of in­
terpretation to every symbol and allegory, that which may not
fit a meaning, say from the psychological or astronomical
aspect, will be found quite correct from the physical or
metaphysical.
IX
The oldest religions of the world—exoterically,
for the esoteric root or foundation is one—are the
Indian, the Mazdean, and the Egyptian. Then
comes the Chaldean, the outcome of these—entirely
lost to the world now, except in its disfigured
Sabeanism as at present rendered by the archaeo­
logists; then, passing over a number of religions
[dealt with in the S.D.], comes the Jewish; esoteric-
ally, as in the Kabala, following in the line of
Babylonian Magism; exoterically, as in Genesis and
the Pentateuch, a collection of allegorical legends.
Read by the light of the Zohar, the initial four
chapters of Genesis are the fragment of a highly
philosophical page in the World’s Cosmogony.
The days of Constantine were the last turning-
point in history, the period of the supreme strug­
gle that ended in the Western world throttling the
old religions in favour of the new one, built on their
bodies. From thence the vista into the far distant
Past, beyond the “Deluge” and the Garden of Eden,
began to be forcibly and relentlessly closed by every
fair and unfair means against the indiscreet gaze
of posterity. Every issue was blocked up, every
record that hands could be laid upon, destroyed.
Yet there remains enough, even among such mutilat­
ed records, to warrant us in saying that there is in
them every possible evidence of the actual existence
of a Parent Doctrine. Fragments have survived
geological and political cataclysms to tell the story;
and every survival shows evidence that the now
Secret Wisdom was once the one fountain head, the
ever-flowing source, at which were fed all its
streamlets—the later religions of all nations—from
the first down to the last. This period, with
Buddha and Pythagoras at the one end and
X
the Neo-Platonists and Gnostics at the other, is the
only focus left in History wherein converge for the
last time the bright rays of light streaming from the
aeons of time gone by, unobscured by the hand of
bigotry and fanaticism (xliv).

it has been found in study classes to be difficult for the

THE NIGHT OF THE UNIVERSE.
This Stanza describes the state of the O
N
EBti during
Pralaya, before the first flutter of re-awakening manifesta­
tion. Such a state can only be symbolised in negatives; for,
since it is the state of Absoluteness per se, it can possess none
of those specific attributes which serve us to describe objects
in positive terms. Hence that state can only be suggested
by the negatives of all those most abstract attributes which
men feel rather than conceive, as the remotest limits attainable
by their power of conception.

The “Parent Space” is the eternal, ever pre­
sent Cause of all—the incomprehensible deity, whose
“invisible robes” are the mystic root of all matter,
and of the Universe. Space is the one eternal thing
that we can most easily imagine, immovable in its
abstraction and uninfluenced by either the presence
or absence in it of an objective Universe. It is with­
out dimension, in every sense, and self-existent.
Spirit is the first differentation from t h a t, the
Causeless Cause of both Spirit and Matter. Thus,
the “Robes” stand for the noumenon of undifferenti­
ated Cosmic Matter. It is not matter as we know
it, but the spiritual essence of matter, and is co­
eternal and even one with Space in its abstract
sense.
l
2
(a) By the ‘‘Seven Eternities,” aeons or periods
are 'meant. The word “Eternity” as understood in
Christian theology, has no meaning to the Asiatic
ear, except in its application to the ONE existence;
nor is the term sempiternity, the eternal only in
futurity, anything better than a misnomer. Such
words do not and cannot exist in philosophical
metaphysics, and were unknown till the advent of
ecclesiastical Christianity.
The “Seven Eternities” meant are the seven
periods—or a period answering in its duration to
the seven periods—of a Manvantara [cycle of mani­
festation], extending throughout a Maha-Kalpa or
the “Great Age”—100 “Years” of Brahma*—making
a total of 311, 040, 000, 000, 000 of our years; each
“Year” of Brahma being composed of 360 “Days”,
and of the same number of “Nights” of Brahma
(reckoning by the Chandraydna or lunar year) ; and
a “Day of Brahma consisting of 4,320, 000,000 of
mortal years. [These figures are taken from the
“Chronology of the Brahmins” which follows the
comments on Stanza II, v. 9. in S.D. II, 68.]
2. TIME WAS NOT, FOR IT LAY ASLEEP IN THE IN­
FINITE BOSOM OF DURATION, (a).
(a) Time is only an illusion produced by the
succession of our states of consciousness as we travel
*The male creator of the Hindu Pantheon, as distinguished
from Brahma (neuter, with final a not accented) or Brahman,
the impersonal, supreme and uncognizable Principle of the
Universe from the essence of which all emanates, and into
which all returns. It is eternal, beginningless and endless,
whereas Brahma exists periodically in his manifestation only,
and is annihilated when the Universe is in obscuration
(Plalaya).
3
through eternal duration, and it does not exist where
no consciousness exists in which the illusion can be
produced; but “lies asleep.”
The real person or thing does not consist solely
of what is seen at any particular moment, but is com­
posed of the sum of all its various and changing con­
ditions from its appearance in the material form to
its disappearance from the earth.
Under “Relativity and The Secret Doctrine” in
Buddhism the Science of Life, 2nd. Ed. p. 121, it is
shown how closely the more advanced scientific thin­
kers approximate to these definitions.
In Space, Time and Gravitation, Professor Edding­
ton says:
“The reality is in our own consciousness.
There are mental aspects deep within the world
of physics. . . Everything is relative to human
perception.”
“Time”, writes the Initiate K.H. (M. L„ 194)
“is something created entirely by ourselves. . . Of
all the sentient and conscious beings on earth, man
is the only animal that takes any cognizance of time,
although it makes him neither happier nor wiser.”
The Secret Doctrine postulates abstract space,
motion, and duration as the three aspects of the
absolute; whereas Time is finite and can be divided.
3. UNIVERSAL MIND HAS NOT, FOR THERE WERE,
NO AH-HI (CELESTIAL BEINGS) TO CONTAIN
(HENCE TO MANIFEST) IT. (a).
(a) “Mind” [Sk. Manas] is a name given to
the sum of the states of Consciousness grouped under
Thought, Will, and Feeling. During deep sleep,
ideation ceases on the physical plane, and memory
is in abeyance; thus for the time being “Mind is
4
not”, because the organ through which the Ego mani­
fests ideation and memory on the material plane has
temporarily ceased to function.
A noumenon can become a phenomenon on any
plane of existence only by manifesting on that plane
through an appropriate basis or vehicle; and during
the long night of rest called Pralaya, when all exist­
ences are dissolved, the “universal m in d ” remains
as a permanent possibility of mental action, or as
that abstract absolute thought, of which Mind is
the concrete relative manifestation.
The AH-HI (Dhyan-Chohans, “Lords of Medita­
tion”) are the collective hosts of spiritual beings—
the Angelic Hosts of Christianity, the Elohim and
“Messengers” of the Jews—who are the vehicle for
the manifestation of the divine or universal thought
and will. They are the intelligent forces that give
to and enact in Nature her “laws”, while themselves
acting according to laws imposed upon them in a
similar manner by still higher powers; but they are
not “the personifications” of the powers of Nature,
as erroneously thought.
The Causes of Being.
4. THE SEVEN WAYS TO BLISS (MOKSHA OR
NIRVANA) WERE NOT (a). THE GREAT CAUSES
OF MISERY (NIDANA AND MAYA) WERE NOT,
FOR THERE WAS NO ONE TO PRODUCE AND GET
ENSNARED BY THEM, (h).
(a) There are seven “Paths” or “Ways” to
the bliss of Non-Existence, which is absolute Being,
‘
Existence, and Consciousness [Nirvana'}. They
“were not,” because the Universe was, so far, empty,
and existed only in the Divine Thought.
(b) The Twelve Nicl&nas, or Causes of Being.
Each is the effect of its antecedent cause, and a
THE TIBETAN BUDDHIST WHEEL OF LIFE.

5
cause, in its turn, to its successor. They belong to the
theory of the stream of catenated law which pro­
duces merit and demerit, and finally brings Karma
[Law of Cause and Effect or Ethical Causation. Tib.
Le-dyum-dre'], into full sway.
[The Nidanas (Tib. Ten-dre) are symbolically
depicted in the twelve divisions of the Tibetan Bud­
dhist Wheel of Life (Ten-dre-gyi-khor-lo), and the
doctrine involved is fully dealt with in Tsong-Kha-pa’s
great work, the Lam-rim chen-mo (C.D. 537). See
The Voice of the Silence, Peking Ed. p, 114.]
Maya, (Illusion) is an element which enters into
all finite things, for everything that exists has only
a relative, not an absolute, reality, since the appear­
ance which the hidden noumenon assumes for any
observer depends upon his power of cognition.
Whatever reality things possess must be looked
for in them before or after they have passed like a
flash through the material world; but we cannot
cognise any such existence directly, so long as we have
sense-instruments which bring only material existence
into the field of our consciousness. Maya, is trans­
cended when Absolute Consciousness is reached.
“It is just because the five senses (normal to our
present race—the Fifth) are delusive, that the con­
clusions and observation of Western science are liable
to error; whereas those of the trained Seers and Ini­
tiates of the East are the result of developing the sixth
and seventh senses which rise above Illusion” (B.S.L.
125). >
5. DARKNESS ALONE FILLED THE BOUNDLESS ALL
(a), FOR FATHER, MOTHER AND SON WERE
ONCE MORE ONE, AND THE SON HAD NOT
AWAKENED YET FOR THE NEW WHEEL AND HIS
PILGRIMAGE THEREON. (6).
6
(a) “Darkness is Father-Mother: Light their
Son”, says an old Eastern proverb. Light is incon­
ceivable except as coming from some source which
is the cause of it; and as, in the instance of
primordial light, that source is unknown, though as
strongly demanded by reason and logic, therefore it
is called “Darkness” by us, from an intellectual point
of view. As to borrowed or secondary light, what­
ever its source, it can be but of a temporary mayavic
[illusionary] character. Darkness, then, is the
Eternal Matrix in which the sources of Light appear
and disappear.
(b) The Father-Mother are the male and
female principles in root-nature, the opposite poles
that manifest in all things on every plane of Kosmos,
or Spirit and Substance, in a less allegorical aspect,
the resultant of which is the Universe, or the Son,
whose “pilgrimage” is his cycle of re-births during
the Maha-Kalpa.
They are “once more One” when in “The Night
of Brahma”, during Pralaya, all in the objective
Universe has returned to its one primal and eternal
Cause, to re-appear at the following Dawn—as it
does periodically.
^Wheel” is the symbolical expression for a
world or globe, which shows that the ancients were
aware that our Earth was a revolving globe, not a
motionless square as some Christian Fathers taught.
The “Great Wheel” is the whole duration of our
Cycle of being, or Maha Kalya, i.e., the whole revolu­
tion of our special chain of seven planets or Spheres
from beginning to end; the “Small Wheels” mean­
ing the Rounds, of which there are also Seven.
Cf. Tibetan Wheel of Life {ante).
[In The Buddhist Praying Wheel (London;
1896) Mr. William Simpson has collected valuable
7
information on the symbolism of the Wheel and
circular movements in custom and religious ritual
all over the world.]
6. THE SEVEN SUBLIME LORDS AND THE SEVEN
TRUTHS HAD CEASED TO BE (a), AND THE
UNIVERSE, THE SON OF NECESSITY, WAS IM­
MERSED IN FARANISHPANNA (ft) (ABSOLUTE
PERFECTION, PARANIRVANA, (TIB. YONG-GRUB)
TO BE OUT-BREATHED BY THAT WHICH IS AND
YET IS NOT. NAUGHT WAS. (c)
(a) The seven sublime lords are the Seven
Creative Spirits, the Dhyan-Chohans, who corres­
pond to the Hebrew Elohim.... They watch suc­
cessively over one of the Rounds and the great Root
Races of our planetary chain. [See diagram of
Rounds, Races, etc.]
(b) “Paranishpanna” is the absolute perfection
to which all existences attain at the close of a great
period of activity, or Maha-Manvantara, and in
which they rest during the succeeding period of re­
pose. Up to the day of the Yogacliarya school the true
nature of Paranirvdna was taught publicly, but since
then it has become entirely esoteric; hence so many
contradictory interpretations of it. It is only a true
Idealist who can understand it. It is absolute only
in a relative sense, since a higher standard is set in
the next period of activity, each being an effect of its
predecessor and cause of its successor.
(c) By “that which is and yet is not” is meant
the Great Breath itself, which we can only speak of
as Absolute Existence, but cannot picture to our ima­
gination as any form of existence that we can dis­
tinguish from Non-existence.
7. THE CA USES OF EXISTENCE HAD BEEN DONE
AWAY WITH (a); THE VISIBLE THAT IRAS, AND
8
THE INVISIBLE THAT IS, RESTED IN ETERNAL
NON-BEING, THE ONE BEING (b).
(a) “The Causes of Existence” mean not only
the physical causes known to science, but the
metaphysical causes, the chief'of which is the desire
to exist, an outcome of Niddna and Mayci. This desire
for a sentient life shows itself in everything, from
an atom to a sun, and is a reflection of the Divine
Thought propelled into objective existence, a
law that the Universe should exist. According to
esoteric teaching, the real cause of that supposed
desire, and of all existence, remains for ever hidden,
and its first emanations are the most complete
abstractions the mind can conceive. . . These
abstractions become more and more concrete as they
approach our plane of existence, until finally they
phenomenalise in the form of the material Universe,
by a process of conversion of metaphysics into
physics, analogous to that by which steam can be
condensed into water, and the water frozen into ice.
(b) The idea of Eternal Non-Being, which is
the One Being, will appear a paradox to anyone
who does not remember that we limit our ideas of
Being to our present consciousness of existence;
making it a specific, instead of a generic term. . .
In our case the One Being is the noumenon of all
the noumena which we know must underlie pheno­
mena, and give them whatever shadow of reality
they possess, but which we have not the senses or
the intellect to cognise at present.
[Noumenon. Gk. The thing perceived. Metaph.
An object perceived by the mind as opposed to a
phenomenon].
Alone the Initiate, rich with the lore acquired
by numberless generations of his predecessors,
9
directs the “Eye of Dangma” [see next verse, 8]
toward the essence of things in which no Maya can
have any influence. It is here that the teachings of
Esoteric Philosophy in relation to the Nidanas and
the Four Truths become of the greatest importance;
but they are secret.
The Eye of Spiritual Vision.
8. ALONE, THE ONE FORM OF EXISTENCE
STRETCHED BOUNDLESS, INFINITE, CAUSELESS,
IN DREAMLESS SLEEP (a); AND LIFE PULSATED
UNCONSCIOUS IN UNIVERSAL SPACE, THROUGH­
OUT THAT ALL-PRESENCE WHICH IS SENSED BY
THE “OPENED EYE” OF THE DANGMA. (b).
(a) The tendency of modern thought is to
recur to the archaic idea of a homogeneous basis for
apparently widely different things—heterogeneity
developed from homogeneity. . . The Secret Doctrine
carries this idea into the region of metaphysics and
postulates “One Form of Existence” as the basis
and source of all things; but perhaps the phrase is
not altogether correct. The Sanskrit word is
Prabhavapyaya, “the place, or rather plane, whence
emerges the origination, and into which is the resolu­
tion of all things,” says a commentator. . . The
Puranic Commentators explain it by Karana—
“Cause”—but the Esoteric Philosphy by the Ideal
Spirit of that Cause. It is, in its secondary stage, the
Svabhavat of the Buddhist philosopher. [See Stanza
II v. 1. (d) ].
“Dreamless sleep” is one of the seven states of
consciousness known in Oriental Esotericism. . . It
is here applied allegorically to the Universe to ex­
press a condition somewhat analogous to that state
of consciousness in man, which, not being remember­
ed in a waking state, seems a blank; just as the
10
sleep of the mesmerised subject seems to him an
unconscious blank when he returns to his normal
condition, although he has been talking and acting
as a conscious individual would.
(b) In India it is called “The Eye of Siva”,
but beyond the great range [Himalayas] it is known
as “Dangma’s opened eye” in Esoteric phraseology.
Dangma means a purified soul, one who has
become Jivanmukta, the highest adept, or rather a
Mahatma (so-called). His “opened eye” is the inner
spiritual eye of the seer, and the faculty which mani­
fests through it is not clairvoyance as ordinarily
understood, but rather the faculty of spiritual intui­
tion, through which direct and certain knowledge is
obtainable. This faculty is intimately connected
with the “Third Eye”, which mythological tradition
ascribes to certain races of men. [See Part II, Stanza
X, v. 42.]
The Universal Soul.
9. BUT WHERE WAS THE DANGMA WHEN THE ALAYA
OF THE UNIVERSE (SOUL AS THE BASIS OF ALL,
ANIMA MUNDI) WAS IN PARAMARTHA (a) AB­
SOLUTE BEING AND CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH ARE
ABSOLUTE NON-BEING AND UNCONSCIOUSNESS)
AND THE GREAT WHEEL WAS ANUPADAKA? (b).
(a) The two terms Alaya and Paramartha
have been the cause of dividing schools and splitting
the truth into more different aspects than any other
mystic terms. Alaya (Tib. Nying-bo) is literally the
“Soul of the World or Anima Mundi, the “Over-Soul”
of Emerson, and though eternal and changeless in its
inner essence on the planes which are unreachable by
either men or Cosmic Gods (Dhyani-Buddhas), it al­
ters during the active life-period with respect to the
lower planes, ours included.
11
In the Esoteric Schools of Mahdyana Buddhism,
Alaya has double and even a triple meaning. In the
Yogachdrya system it is both the Universal Soul and
the Self of a progressed Adept. “He who is strong in
the Yoga can introduce at will his Alaya by means
of meditation into the true Nature of Existence,” says
Arydsanga, founder of a Buddhist esoteric school.
[Yoga. The Science of Spiritual development].
Esoteric Philosophy teaches that everything lives
and is conscious, but not that all life and conscious­
ness are similar to those of human or even animal
beings. Life we look upon as “the one form of exis­
tence,” manifesting in what is called matter; or, as
in man, what, incorrectly separating them, we name
Spirit, Soul and Matter.
(b) The tern Anupadaka “Parentless,” [i.e.,
Self-created] without progenitors, is a mystical de­
signation having several meanings in the philosophy.
By this name celestial Beings, the Dhyan-Chohans or
Dhyani-Buddhas, are generally meant. But as these
correspond mystically to the Mtinushi (Human)
Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, the latter are also de­
signated Anupadaka, once that their whole personality
is merged in their compound sixth and seventh prin­
ciples (Atma-Buddhi), and that they have become the
Diamond-Souled (Sk. Vajra-sattva; Tib. Dorje-
sempa), the full Mahatmas.
The expression “The Great Wheel was Anupa­
daka” means that the Universe was in its formless,
eternal, or absolute condition, before it was fashioned
by the “Builders.” [See next Stanza].
STANZA II.
THE IDEA OF DIFFERENTIATION.
The stage described in this Stanza is, to a Western mind,
sc nearly identical with that mentioned in the first Stanza,
that to express the idea of its difference would require a
treatise in itself. Hence it must be left to the intuition and
the higher faculties of the reader to grasp, as far as he1can,
the meaning of the allegorical phrases used. Indeed, it must
be remembered that all these Stanzas appeal to the inner
faculties, rather than to the ordinary comprehension of' the
physical brain.
The Architects of the Universe.
1. WHERE WERE THE BUILDERS, THE LUMINOUS
SONS OF MANVANTARIC DAWN? (a). IN THE UN­
KNOWN DARKNESS IN THEIR AH-HI (CHOHANIC,
DHYANI-BUDDHIC) PARANISHPANNA (6), THE
PRODUCERS OF FORM (RUPA) FROM NO-FORM
(ARUPA), THE ROOT OF THE WORLD—THE DEVA-
MATRI AND SVABHa VAT, RESTED IN THE BLISS
OF NON-BEING, (d).
(a) The “Builders”, the “Sons of Manvantaric
Dawn”, are the real creators of the Universe; and in
this doctrine, which deals only ivith our Planetary
System, they, as the Architects of the latter, are
also called the “Watchers” of the Seven Spheres. . .
[The “Seven Spheres,” or Planets, of our
System correspond to the Seven Dhyani-Buddhas
emanating from Adi-Budha (Primeval Wisdom).
Under each is born one of the human groups which
is guided and influenced thereby. These Seven
12
13
Planets are in direct astral and psychic communica­
tion with the Earth, its Guides and “Watchers” (see
above)—morally and physically. The visible orbs
furnish our Humanity with its outward and inward
characteristics, and their Regents of Rectors with our
Monads and spiritual faculties. . . The Planetary
origin of the Monad (Soul) and of its faculties, was
taught by the Gnostics.—See I, 575-7.]
(b) Paranishpanna (q.v. ante) without Para-
martha, the Self-analysing consciousness (Svasamve-
dana) is no bliss [Nirvana], but simply “extinction.”
(d) Devamatri “Mother of the Gods,” Aditi,
or Cosmic Space. In the Zohar, she is called Sephira
the Mother of the Sephiroth, and Shekinah in her
primordial form, in abscondito.
[Zohar. Ancient treatise on Hebrew Esoteric
doctrines].
Svabhavat. The Root of all things, the Buddhistic
concrete aspect of the abstraction called in Hindu
philosophy Mulaprakiti. . . Chinese mystics have
made of it a synonym of “Being”. [See v. 5.]
“Study the laws and the doctrines of the Nepau-
lese Svabhavikas” (writes the Initiate K.II. to A. P.
Sinnett.—M.L., 140) “the principal Buddhist philoso­
phical school in India, and you will find them the most
learned as the most scientifically logical wranglers in
the world. Their plastic, invisible, eternal, omnipre­
sent and unconscious Svabhavat is Foi’ce or Motion
ever generating its electricity which is Life.” This
is the “Cosmic Electricity” called Fohab, which is in­
telligent. [See Stanza III, v. 12.]
2. WHERE WAS SILENCE? WHERE WERE THE EARS
TO SENSE IT? NO! THERE WAS NEITHER
SILENCE, NOR SOUND (a). NAUGHT SAVE CEASE­
LESS, ETERNAL BREATH (MOTION) WHICH
KNOWS ITSELF NOT. (b).
14
(a) The idea that things can cease to exist and
still be, is a fundamental one in Eastern psychology.
Under this apparent contradiction in terms there
rests a fact of Nature to realise which in the mind,
rather than to argue about words, is the important
thing. Existence as water may be said to be, for
Oxygen and Hydrogen, a state of Non-being which is
“more real being” than their existence as gases; and
it may faintly symbolise the condition of the Universe
v/hen it goes to sleep, or ceases to be, during the
“Nights of Brahma”—to awaken or re-appear when
the dawn of the new Manvantara recalls it to what
we term existence.
(b) The “Breath” of the One Existence is used
in its application only to the spiritual aspect of Cos­
mogony by Archaic Esotericism; otherwise it is re­
placed by its equivalent on the material plane—Mo­
tion.
To know itself or oneself necessitates conscious­
ness and perception (both limited faculties in rela­
tion to any subject except Parabrahm) to be cognis­
ed. Hence the “Eternal Breath which knows itself
not.” Infinity cannot comprehend finiteness. The
Boundless can have no relation to the bounded and
conditioned.
In the Occult teachings, the Unknown and the
Unknowable mover, or the Self-Existing, is the ab­
solute Divine Essence. And thus being Absolute
Consciousness and Absolute Motion—to the limited
senses of those who describe this indescribable—it is
unconsciousness and immoveableness.
Consciousness implies limitations and qualifica­
tions; something to be conscious of, and someone to
be conscious of it. But Absolute Consciousness con­
tains the cogniser, the thing cognised, and the cogni­
tion: all three in itself, and all three one.
15
3. THE HOUR HAD NOT YET STRUCK; THE RAY HAD
NOT YET FLASHED INTO THE GERM; (a) THE
MATRIPADMA (MOTHER LOTUS) HAD NOT YET
SWOLLEN, (b).
(а) The ray of the “Ever Darkness” becomes,
as it is emitted, a ray of effulgent light or life, and
flashes into the “Germ”—the point in the Mundane
Egg, represented by matter in its abstract sense. But
the term “point” must not be understood as applying
to any particular point in Space, for a germ exists
in the centre of every atom, and these collectively
form the “Germ”.
(б) One of the symbolical figures for the Dual
creative power in Nature (matter and force on the
material plane) is Padma, the water-lily of India.
The Lotus is the product of heat (fire) and water
(vapour or Ether). Fire stands in every philosophical
and religious system as a representation of the Spirit
of Deity, the active, male, generative principle; and
Ether, or the Soul of Matter, the light of the fire,
for the passive female principle from which every­
thing in this Universe emanated. Hence Ether or
Water is the Mother, and Fire is the Father.
The Lotus is, moreover, a very ancient and
favourite simile for the Kosmos itself, and also for
man. Its root sunk in the mud represents material
life, the stalk passing up through the water typifies
existence in the astral world, and the flower floating
on the water and opening to the sky is emblematical
of spiritual being.
4. HER HEART HAD NOT YET OPENED FOR THE ONE
RAY TO ENTER, THENCE TO FALL AS THREE INTO
FOUR IN THE LAP OF MAYA. (a).
(a) The Primordial Substance had not yet
passed out of its pre-cosrcic latency into differentiated
16
objectivity, or even become the (to man, so far,) invi­
sible Protyle of Science. But, as the hour strikes and
it becomes receptive of the Fohatic [see Stanza III,
12] impress of the Divine Thought (the Logos, or
male aspect of the Anima Mundi, Alaya) its heart
opens. It differentiates, and the THREE (Father,
Mother, Son) are transformed into four.
Herein lies the origin of the double mystery of
the Trinity and the Immaculate Conception. The first
and fundamental dogma of Occultism is Universal
Unity (or Homogeneity) under three Aspects. This
led to a possible conception of Deity, which as an
Absolute Unity must remain forever incomprehensible
to finite intellects.
Say the Kabalists: “The Deity is one, because it
is infinite. It is triple, because it is ever manifest­
ing.” This manifestation is triple in its aspects, for
it requires, as Aristotle has it, three principles for
every natural body to become objective: privation,
form, and matter. Privation meant in the mind of
the great philosopher that which the Occultists call
the prototypes impressed on the Astral Light—
the
lowest plane and world of Anima Mundi.
The union of these three principles depends upon
a fourth—the LIFE which radiates from the summits
of the Unreachable, to become a universally diffused
Essence on the manifested planes of Existence. And
this Quaternary (Father, Mother, Son, as a U n it y ,
and a Quaternary as a living manifestation) has been
the means of leading to the very archaic Idea of Im­
maculate Conception, now finally crystallized into a
dogma of the Christian Church, which carnalized this
metaphysical idea beyond any common sense. For one
has but to read the Kabala and study its numerical
methods of interpretation to find the origin of that
17
dogma. It is purely astronomical, mathematical, and
pre-eminently metaphysical.
The “Son” of the immaculate Celestial Virgin (or
the undifferentiated cosmic protyle, Matter in its
infinitude) is born again on Earth as the ‘Son’ of the
terrestrial ‘Eve’ (our mother Earth) and becomes
Humanity as a total—past, present, and future—for
Jehovah or Jod-he-vau-he is androgyne, or both male
and female.
Above, the ‘Son’is the whole K o s m o s ; below, h e
is M a n k i n d . [This is the Key].
The Triad or Triangle becomes Tetraktys, the
sacred Pythagorean number, the perfect Square, and
a 6-faced cube on Earth. It is now in the “Lap of
Maya,” the great Illusion, and between itself and the
Reality has the Astral Light, the great Deceiver of
man’s limited senses, unless Knowledge through
Paramarthasatya comes to the rescue.
The surface of the Cube is composed of six
squares, and the Cube unfolded gives the Cross, or
the vertical Four barred by the horizontal Three.
The six thus make seven—the Seven Principles
(Pythagorean seven properties) in Man. See
Skinner’s Source of Measures.—T.B.L. II. 7.
Paramarthasatya (Tib. Don-dam-den-pa. C.D. 644).
Absolute Truth. From Parama (above everything),
artha (comprehension), and satya (absolute true
being or Esse). Its opposite is Samvritisatya Relative
Truth only, the Tibetan equivalent meaning “Illu­
sion-creating appearance.”
5. THE SEVEN (SONS) WERE NOT YET BORN FROM
THE WEB OF LIGHT. DARKNESS ALONE WAS
FATHER-MOTHER, SVABHAVAT, AND SVABHAVAT
WAS IN DARKNESS, (a).
(a) The Secret Doctrine, in the Stanzas given
here, occupies itself chiefly, if not entirely, with our
18
Solar System, and especially with our Planetary
Chain. The “Seven Sons,” therefore, are the creators
of the latter.
6. THESE TWO ARE THE GERM, AND THE GERM IS—
ONE. THE UNIVERSE WAS STILL CONCEALED IN
THE DIVINE THOUGHT AND THE DIVINE BOSOM,
(a).
(a) The “D ivine T hought” does not imply the
idea of a Divine thinker. The Universe, as the
Absolute Being, with the Past and Future crystalliz­
ed in an eternal Present, is that Thought itself re­
flected in a secondary and manifest cause. Brahma
(neuter), as the Mysterium Magnum of Paracelsus,
is an absolute mystery to the human mind. Brahma,
the male-female, its aspect and anthropomorphic re­
flection, is conceivable to the perceptions of blind
faith, though rejected by human intellect when it
attains its majority.
Hence the statement that during the prologue,
so to say, of the drama of Creation, or the beginning
of Cosmic Evolution, the Universe or the “Son” lies
still concealed “in the Divine Thought”, which had
not yet penetrated “into the Divine Bosom.” This
idea, note well, is at the root, and forms the origin
of all the allegories about the “Sons of God” born
of immaculate virgins.
STANZA ill.
THE AWAKENING OF KOSMOS.
This Stanza describee the Re-awakening of the Universe
to life after Pralaya. It depicts the emergence of the “Monads”
from their state of absorption within the one; the earliest and
highest stage in the formation of “Worlds”, the term Monad
being one which may apply equally to the vastest Solar System
or the tiniest atom.
1. THE LAST VIBRATION OF THE SEVENTH ETERN­
ITY THRILLS THROUGH INFINITUDE (a). THE
MOTHER SWELLS, EXPANDING FROM WITHIN
WITHOUT LIKE THE BUD OF THE LOTUS (b).
(a) The seemingly paradoxical use of the term
“Seventh Eternity”, thus dividing the indivisible, is
sanctified in Esoteric Philosophy. The latter divides
boundless duration into unconditionally eternal and
universal Time, and a conditioned one (Khanclakdla).
One is the abstraction or noumenon of infinite
time (Kala) ; the other its phenomenon appearing
periodically, as the effect of Mahat (Universal In­
telligence limited by Manvantaric duration).
(b) Therefore, the “last vibration of the
Seventh Eternity” was “foreordained”—by no God
in particular, but occurred in virtue of the eternal
and changeless Law which causes the great periods
of Activity and Rest, called so graphically, and at
the same time so poetically, the “Days and Nights
of Brahma”.
The expansion “from within without” of the
Mother, called elsewhere the “Waters of Space”,
19
20
“Universal Matrix”, etc., does not allude to an ex­
pansion from a small centre or focus, but, without
reference to size or limitation of area, means the
development of limitless subjectivity into as limitless
objectivity.
[This may seem rather puzzling, but evidently
it means that Kala and Khandakdla are the noumenon
and phenomenon of Duration.
Kala (Sk.). Infinite Time or Eternity.
Khandakdla (Sk.). Finite or conditioned Time
in contradistinction to Kala.']
The Eternal Pilgrim.
2. THE VIBRATION SWEEPS ALONG, TOUCHING
WITH ITS SWIFT WING (SIMULTANEOUSLY) THE
WHOLE UNIVERSE, AND THE GERM THAT DWEL-
LETH IN DARKNESS: THE DARKNESS THAT
BREATHES (MOVES) OVER THE SLUMBERING
WATERS OF LIFE (a).
(a) The Pythagorean Monad is also said to
dwell in solitude and darkness like the “germ”. The
idea of the “breath” of Darkness moving over “the
slumbering Waters of life”, which is primordial mat­
ter with the latent Spirit in it, recalls the first chapter
of Genesis. In all Cosmogonies Water is the basis
and source of material existence. It is used by Oc­
cultists in a generic sense, and in Cosmogony with a
metaphysical and mystical meaning.
[H.P.B. distinguishes between the Monad of
Leibnitz, Spinoza, Humboldt, etc., and that of
Pythagoras, the great Greek Adept, who studied
the Indian Esoteric systems, and taught Re-incarna­
tion and other fundamental laws.]
“Eternal Pilgrim” is the appellation given to
our Monad (the two in one; Sk. Atma-Buddhi)
21
during its cycle of incarnations. It is the only im­
mortal and eternal principle in us, being an in­
divisible part of the integral whole—the Universal
Spirit, from which it emanates (to use an awl^rrd
and incorrect expression for lack of a better in
English), and into which it is absorbed at the end
of the cycle. See “The Eternity of the Pilgrim” (I, 16).
3. “DARKNESS” RADIATES LIGHT, AND LIGHT DROPS
ONE SOLITARY RAY INTO THE WAT'ERS, INTO
THE MOTHER DEEP (a). THE RAY SHOOTS
THROUGH THE VIRGIN-EGG; THE RAY CAUSES
THE ETERNAL EGG TO THRILL, AND DROP THE
NON-ETERNAL (PERIODICAL) GERM, WHICH CON­
DENSES INTO THE WORLD EGG (6).
(a) The solitary ray dropping into the mother
deep may be taken as meaning Divine Thought or
Intelligence impregnating Chaos. This, however,
occurs on the plane of metaphysical abstraction, or
rather the plane whereon that which we call a
metaphysical abstraction is a reality.
The Virgin Egg, being in one sense abstract
Egg-ness, or the power of becoming developed
through fecundation, is eternal and for ever the
same. It is the microcosmic symbol of the.
macrocosmic prototype—the “Virgin Mother”—
Chaos or the Primeval Deep.
[Microcosm. The name given by the philosophers
of the Middle Ages to Man as representing the
Macrocosm or Universe in Nature. See Stanza V, 1
(a) on the Atom as a microcosm and the recent
discoveries of Science in this connection under “Exit
the Material Atom of Science.”]
(b) The “World Egg” is, perhaps, one of the
most universally adopted symbols, highly suggestive
22
as it is, equally in the spiritual, physiological, and
cosmological sense. Therefore, it is found in every
world-theogony, where it is largely associated with
the serpent symbol; the latter being everywhere, in
philosophy as in religious symbolism, an emblem of
eternity, infinitude, regeneration, and rejuvenation,
as well as of wisdom.
4. (THEN) THE THREE (TRIANGLE) FALL INTO THE
FOUR (QUATERNARY). THE RADIANT ESSENCE
BECOMES SEVEN INSIDE, SEVEN OUTSIDE (a).
THE LUMINOUS EGG (HIRANYAGARBHA), WHICH
IN ITSELF IS THREE (THE TRIPLE HYPOSTASES
OF BRAHMA, OR VISHNU, THE TPIREE “AVAST-
IiAS” OR “STATES”), CURDLES AND SPREADS IN
MILK-WHITE CURDS THROUGHOUT THE DEPTHS
OF MOTHER, THE ROOT THAT GROWS IN THE
OCEAN OF LIFE (6).
(а) In the Book of Dzyan, as in the Kabala,
there are two kinds of numerals to be studied—the
figures, often simple blinds; and the Sacred Num­
bers, the values of which are all known to the Oc­
cultists through Initiation. Number is, as Balzac the
unconscious Occultist thought, an Entity, and, at
the same time, a Breath emanating from what he
called God and what we call the ALL....................
(б) Astronomically the “milky way”, the world-
stuff, or primordial matter in its first form. [See
Stanza. IV v. 5 (d) on Comets].
In Occult Science and Symbolism it is the most
complicated of glyphs, enshrining more than a dozen
symbols.
In Hindu allegory, besides Amrita, the water
of life or immortality, “Surabhi”the “cow of plenty”,
called “the fountain of milk and curds”, was ex­
tracted from this “Sea of Milk”. Hence the universal
23
adoration of the cow and bull, one the productive,
the other the generative power in Nature: symbols
connected with both the Solar and the Cosmic deities.
The specific properties, for occult purposes, of
the “fourteen precious things”, being explained only
at the fourth Initiation, cannot be given here. The
Japanese Secret Science of the Buddhist Mystics, the
Yamabushi, the ascetics of Kyoto (the Dzenoclu),
and the mystics of the Lao-Tze sect have “seven
precious things” or “jewels” which are really
“mysteries”. Only, the Chinese and Japanese Bud­
dhist ascetics and Initiates are, if possible, even more
reticent in giving out their “knowledge” than are
the Hindus.—I, 3^S., 173.
5. THE ROOT REMAINS, THE LIGHT REMAINS, THE
CURDS REMAIN, AND STILL OEAOHOO (a) IS ONE

[AUM is the glyph of the “Triple Fire” in the
Universe and Man, sacred alike to the Hindus and
the Buddhists. Mani (Jewel) is the Inner Divinity
or Higher Self in the Lotus (Padme) or body of man.
HUM (Sk.) is a mystic syllable used in meditation or
chanting a mantram, such as the above, as symbolic
of the highest bliss. In Tibetan the vowel A (Ah)
is symbolic of the Absolute or Unknowable, and M
24
(Ma) of non-attachment to objects of sense. See
Tibetan-English Diet, by Sarat Chandra Das.]
(b) Non-Separateness of all that lives and has
its being-, whether in active or passive state. In one
sense Oeaohoo is the “Rootless Root of All” ; hence,
one with Parabrahman; in another sense it is a name
for the manifested ONE LIFE, the Eternal living
Unity.
Parabrahman. Lit. “Beyond Brahman.” The
all-inclusive Kosmos or Infinite Space. In Northern
Buddhist philosophy Adi-Budha (Tib. Chog-gi dangpoi
Sangye. C.D. 437).
6. THE ROOT OF LIFE WAS IN EVERY DROP OF THE
OCEAN OF IMMORTALITY (AMRITA) AND THE
OCEAN JRAS RADIANT LIGHT, WHICH WAS FIRE
AND HEAT AND MOTION. DARKNESS VANISHED
AND WAS NO MORE. IT DISAPPEARED IN ITS
OWN ESSENCE, THE BODY OF FIRE AND WATER,
OF FATHER AND MOTHER (a).
(a.) The essence of darkness being absolute
light, Darkness is taken as the appropriate allegorical
representation of the condition of the Universe during
Pralaya, or the term of absolute rest, or non-being,
as it appears to our finite minds.
The “fire”, “heat”, and “motion” are the under­
lying abstractions the noumena, or essence of the
material manifestations of physical Science.
DARKNESS is the one true actuality, the basis
and root of light, without which the latter could never
manifest itself, nor even exist.
The Divine Dragon of Wisdom.
7. BEHOLD, OH LANOO, THE RADIANT CHILD OF
THE TWO, THE UNPARALLELED REFULGENT
GLORY, BRIGHT SPACE, SON OF DARK SPACE,
WHO EMERGES FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE
25
GREAT DARK WATERS. IT IS OEAOHOO, THE
YOUNGER, THE . . . . (WHOM THOU KNOWEST
NOW AS KWAN-SH^I-YIN.—Comment) (a). HE
SHINES FORTH AS THE SUN. HE IS THE BLAZING
DIVINE DRAGON OF WISDOM. THE EKA (ONE) IS
CHATUR (FOUR), AND CHATUR TAKES TO ITSELF
THREE, AND THE UNION PRODUCES THE SAPTA
(SEVEN) IN WHOM ARE THE SEVEN WHICH BE-,
COME THE TRIDASA (THE THRICE TEN) THE
HOSTS AND THE MULTITUDES (b). BEHOLD HIM
LIFTING THE VEIL, AND UNFURLING IT FROM
EAST TO WEST. HE SHUTS OUT THE ABOVE AND
LEAVES THE BELOW TO BE SEEN AS THE GREAT
ILLUSION. HE MARKS THE PLACES FOR THE
SHINING ONES (STARS) AND TURNS THE UPPER
(SPACE) INTO A SHORELESS SEA OF FIRE, AND
THE ONE MANIFESTED (ELEMENT) INTO THE
GREAT WATERS (c).
(a) “Bright Space, son of dark Space,” cor­
responds to the Ray dropped at the first thrill of the
new “Dawn” into the great Cosmic depths, from
which it re-emerges differentiated as Oeaohoo the
younger, (th e “new L i f e ” ) , to become, to the end
of the life-cycle, the germ of all things.
Lanoo (Sk.) is a student, a disciple {chela) who
studies practical Esotericism.
Kwan-Sh^i-Yin (Sk. Avalokiteswara) is an
androgynous deity, like the Tetragrammaton and all
the Logoi of antiquity. In China his female aspect
is Kwan-Yin (Jap. Kwannon), the Goddess of Mercy,
called the “Divine Voice.”
(b) The “Dragon of Wisdom” is the One, the
Eka (Sk.) or Saka. . . The “One and the Dragon
are expressions used by the ancients in connection
with their respective Logoi. Jehovah—esoterically
(as Elohim)—is also the Serpent or Dragon that
tempted Eve; and the Dragon is an old glyph for
the Astral Light (Primordial Principle), ;“which is
the Wisdom of Chaos.”
26
The primitive symbol of the Serpent stood for
Divine Wisdom and Perfection, Regeneration and
Immortality. The “Dragon” was also the symbol
of the Logos with the Egyptians, as with the
Gnostics.
“Tri-dasa,” or three times ten (30), alludes to
the Vedic deities, in round number’s, or more ac­
curately 33—a sacred number. They are the 12
Adityas, the 8 Vasus, the 11 Rudras, and 2 Aswins—
the twin sons of the Sun and the Sky. This is the
root-number of the Hindu Pantheon, which enumer­
ates 33 crores or over three hundred millions of gods
and goddesses. [These symbolise powers and elements
in Man and Nature].
(c) The intelligence that moves the Universe
is fire, and fire is intelligence. And while Anaxi­
menes said the same of air, and Thales of Miletus
(600 years B.C.) of water, the Esoteric Doctrine re­
conciles all those philosophers by showing that
though each was right the system of none was com­
plete.
8. WHERE WAS THE GERM, AND WHERE WAS NOW
DARKNESS? WHERE IS THE SPIRIT OF THE FLAME
THAT BURNS IN TIIY LAMP, OH LANOO? THE
GERM IS THAT, AND THAT IS LIGHT-. THE WHITE
BRILLIANT SON OF THE DARK HIDDEN
FATHER (a).
(a.) The answer to the first question, suggested
by the second, which is the reply of the teacher to
the pupil, contains in a single phrase one of the most
essential truths of Occult philosophy. It indicates
the existence of things imperceptible to our physical
senses which are of far greater importance, more
real and more permanent, than those that appeal
to these senses themselves.
27
To understand the mystery it is necessary:—
(1) To admit the postulate of a universally
diffused, omnipresent, eternal Deity in Nature;
(2) To have fathomed the mystery of
electricity in its true essence;
#
(3) To credit man with being the septenary
symbol, on the terrestrial plane, of the One Great
UNIT (the Logos), which is Itself the Seven-vowelled
sign, the Breath crystallized into the WORD.
[See Stanza IV and M.L. XXII cited and com­
mented on in B.S.L. 72, where it is stated that no­
where in the Universe has even the insight and
knowledge of a Buddha been able to find anything
but that unconscious involuntary action exhibited also,
by the cerebellum in man. The conscious voluntary
power exhibited by his cerebrum has no counterpart
in the Universe. . . This is the scientific ba,sis of the
Mahayana doctrine that there is “no Deity (Creative
Power) apart from man himself."]
9. LIGHT IS COLD FLAME, AND FLAME IS FIRE, AND
THE, FIRE PRODUCES HEAT, WHICH YIELDS
WATER, THE WATER OF LIFE IN THE GREAT
MOTHER (CHAOS) (a).
(a) The words “Light,” “Fire”, and ’“Flame”
are adopted from the vocabulary of the old “Fire
philosophers,” (Magi) to render better the meaning
to Western minds.
Light is called “cold flame” because, in the order
of Cosmic evolution (as taught by the Occultist),
the energy that actuates matter after its first forma­
tion into atoms is generated on our plane by Cosmic
heat; and because Kosmos, in the sense of dissociat­
ed matter, “was not,” before that period.
28
The Web of the Universe.
10. FATHER-MOTHER SPIN A WEB WHOSE UPPER
END IS FASTENED TO SPIRIT (PURUSHA), THE
LIGHT OF THE ONE DARKNESS, AND THE LOWER
ONE TO MATTER (PRAKRITI) ITS (THE SPIRIT’S)
SHADOWY END; AND THIS WEB IS THE UNIVERSE
SPUN OUT OF THE TWO SUBSTANCES MADE IN
■ONE, WHICH IS SVABHAVAT (a).
(a) Brahma “expands” and becomes the Uni­
verse woven out of his own substance.
The same idea has been beautifully expressed
by Goethe, who says:
Thus at the roaring loom of Time I ply,
And weave for God the Robe thou see’st Him by.
[Emil Burnouf, the great French Orientalist, has
seized the idea perfectly, when saying that Brahma
does not create the earth, any more than the rest
of the universe. “Having evolved himself from the
Soul of the world, once separated from the First
Cause (Brahma neuter), he evaporates with, and
emanates all Nature out of himself. He does not
stand above it, but is mixed up with it; Brahma and
the Universe form one Being, each particle of which
is, in its essence, Brahma himself, who proceeded out
of himself.” The Immanent God of Western mysti­
cism expresses a similar idea.]
11. IT (THE WEB) EXPANDS WHEN THE BREATH OF
FIRE (THE FATHER) IS UPON IT; IT CONTRACTS
WHEN THE BREATH OF THE MOTHER (THE ROOT
OF MATTER) TOUCHES IT. THEN THE SONS (THE
ELEMENTS WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE POWERS OR
INTELLIGENCES) DISSOCIATE AND SCATTER, TO
RETURN INTO THEIR MOTHER’S BOSOM AT THE
END OF THE “GREAT DAY” AND REBECOME ONE
WITH HER (a). WHEN IT (THE WEB) IS COOLING,
IT BECOMES RADIANT, ITS SONS EXPAND AND
CONTRACT THROUGH THEIR OWN SELVES AND
HEARTS; THEY EMBRACE INFINITUDE (b).
29
(a) The expanding of the Universe under the
breath of FIRE is very suggestive in the light of the
“Fire mist” period of which modern science speaks so
much, and knows in reality so little.
(b) The expanding and contracting of the
Web—i.e., the world-stuff or atoms—expresses here
the pulsatory movement; for it is the regular con­
traction and expansion of the infinite and shoreless
Ocean of that which we may call the noumenon of
matter emanated by Svabhavat, which causes the uni­
versal vibration of atoms.
12. TIIENSVa BHa VAT SENDS FORAT TO HARDEN THE
ATOMS (a) EACH (OF THESE) IS A PART OF THE
WEB (UNIVERSE). REFLECTING THE “SELF-
EXISTENT LORD” (PRIMEVAL LIGHT) LIKE A
MIRROR, EACH BECOMES IN TURN A WORLD (b).
(a) It is through Fohat that the ideas of the
Universal Mind are impressed upon matter. Some
faint idea of the nature of Fohat may be gathered
from the appellation “Cosmic Electricity” sometimes
"applied to it; but to the commonly known properties
of electricity must, in this case, be added others, in­
cluding intelligence. [See also Stanza V: “The Various
Aspects of Fohat.”]
(6) This is said in the sense that the flame from
a fire is endless, and that the lights of the whole Uni­
verse could be lit at one simple rush-light without
diminishing its flame.
STANZA IV
THE SEPTENARY HIERARCHIES
This Stanza shows the differentiation of the “Germ” of
the Universe into the septenary hierarchy of conscious Divine
Powers, who are the active manifestation of the One Supreme
Energy. They are the framers, shapers, and ultimately the
creators of all the manifested Universe, in the only sense
in which the name “Creator” is intelligible; they inform and
guide it; they are the intelligent Beings who adjust and
control evolution, embodying in themselves those manifestations
of the ONE LAW, which we know as the “The Laws of
Nature.” Generieally, they are known as the Dhyan Chohans,
though each of the various groups has its own designation
in the Secret Doctrine. This stage of evolution is spoken of
in Hindu mythology as the “Creation” of the Gods.
1. LISTEN, YE SONS OF THE EARTH, TO YOUR IN­
STRUCTORS—THE SONS OF THE FIRE (a). LEARN
THERE IS NEITHER FIRST NOR LAST; FOR ALL
IS ONE NUMBER, ISSUED FROM NO NUMBER (6).
(a) “Sons of the Fire,” are the first Beings
evolved from Primordial Fire. Fire is /Ether in its
purest form, and hence is not regarded as matter,
but it is the unity of /Ether—
the second manifested
deity—in its universality. But there are two “Fires”
and a distinction is made between them in the Oc­
cult teachings. The first, or the purely Formless and
invisible Fire concealed in the Central Spiritual Sun,
is spoken of as “triple” (metaphysically) ; while the
30
31
Fire of the manifested Kosmos is Septenary, through­
out both the Universe and our Solar System.
(b) That which is absolute is of course No
Number; but in its later significance it has an ap­
plication in Space as in Time. It means that not only
every increment of time is part of a larger increment,
up to the most indefinitely prolonged duration con­
ceivable by the human intellect; but also that no
manifested thing can be thought of except as part
of a larger whole: the total aggregate being the One
manifested Universe that issues from the unmani­
fested or Absolute—called Non-Being or “No-Num­
ber,” to distinguish it from BEING or “the One
Number.”
2. LEARN WHAT WE, WHO DESCEND FROM THE
PRIMORDIAL SEVEN, WE, WHO ARE BORN FROM
THE PRIMORDIAL FLAME, HAVE LEARNED FROM
OUR FATHERS (a).
(a) The first “Primordial” are the highest
Beings in the Scale of Existence. They are the
Archangels of Christianity, those who refuse—as
Michael did in the latter system, and as did the eldest
“Mind-born sons’” of Brahma—to create or rather
tc multiply.
3. FROM THE EFFULGENCY OF LIGHT—THE RAY OF
THE EVER-DARKNESS—SPRANG IN SPACE THE
RE-AWAKENED ENERGIES (DHYAN-CHOHANS) :
THE ONE FROM THE EGG, THE SIX AND THE FIVE
(a) ; THEN THE THREE, THE ONE, THE FOUR,
THE ONE, THE FIVE—THE TWICE SEVEN, THE
SUM TOTAL (b). AND THESE ARE: THE ESSENCES,
THE FLAMES, THE ELEMENTS, THE BUILDERS,
THE NUMBERS, THE A R lT
PA (FORMLESS), THE
RUPA (WITH BODIES), AND THE FORCE OR
DIVINE MAN—THE SUM TOTAL. AND FROM THE
DIVINE MAN EMANATED THE FORMS, THE
SPARKS, THE SACRED ANIMALS, AND THE
MESSENGERS OF THE SACRED FATHERS (THE
PITRIS) WITHIN THE HOLY FOUR (c).
32
(a.) Relates to the sacred Science of the
Numerals:
It is on the Hierarchies and correct numbers
of these Beings invisible (to us) except upon very
rare occasions, that the mystery of the whole Uni­
verse is built.
“The One from the Egg, the Six and the Five,”
give the number 1065, the value of the first-born
(later on the male and female Brahma-Prajapati),
who answers to the numbers 7, and 14, and 21 re­
spectively.
In the Mahabharata the Prajdpati are 21 in num­
ber, or ten, six, and five (1065) thrice seven.
(6) “The Three, the One, the Four, the One,
the Five” (in their totality—twice seven) represent
31415—the numerical hierarchy of the Dhyan-
Chohans of various orders, and of the inner or cir­
cumscribed world.......... Mathematically they re­
present the well-known calculation, namely, that the
ratio of the diameter to the circumference of a circle
is as I to 3.1415, or the value of the (pi), as this
ratio is called—the symbol being always used in
mathematical formulae to express it.
The “Sacred Animals” are found in the Bible
as well as in the Kabala, and they have their mean­
ing (a very profound one, too) on the page of the
origins of Life. . . . . .With the astronomical key these
“Sacred Animals” become the signs of the Zodiac.
(c) The 4, represented in the Occult numerals
by the Tetraktys, the Perfect Square, is a Sacred
Number with the mystics of every nation and race.
It has one and the same significance in Brahmanism,
Buddhism, the Kabala and in the Egyptian, Chaldean
and other numerical systems.
33
Potency of Speech and Sound.
4. THIS WAS THE ARMY OF THE VOICE—THE
DIVINE SEPTENARY, THE SPARKS OF THE SEVEN
ARE SUBJECT TO, AND THE SERVANTS OF, THE
FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH, FIFTH, SIXTH,
AND THE SEVENTH OF THE SEVEN (a). THESE
(“SPARKS”) ARE CALLED SPHERES, TRIANGLES,
CUBES, LINES, AND MODELLERS, FOR THUS
STANDS THE ETERNAL NIDANA—THE Ol-HA-HOU
(THE PERMUTATION OF OEAOHOO) (&).
(a) The “Army of the Voice” is a term closely
'connected with the mystery of Sound and Speech,
as an effect and corollary of the cause—Divine
Thought.
[In Sanskrit, Tibetan, and other ancient Oriental
languages every letter has its occult meaning and
potency, the vowels being especially powerful.]
(b) The literal signification of the word Oeao-
hoo is, among the Eastern Occultists of the North,
a circular wind, whirlwind; but, in this instance, it
is a term to denote the ceaseless and eternal Cosmic
Motion; or rather the Force that moves it, which
Force is tacitly accepted as the Deity but never
named. It is the eternal Karana, the ever-acting
Cause.
5. ........... WHICH IS:—
“DARKNESS,” THE BOUNDLESS OR THE NONUM­
BER, ADI-NIDANA SVABHAVAT: THE O (FORX.
UNKNOWN QUANTITY) :
I. THE ADI-SANAT, THE NUMBER, FOR HE IS
ONE (a).
II. THE VOICE OF THE WORD, SVABHAVAT, THE
NUMBERS, FOR HE IS ONE AND NINE (6).
III. THE “FORMLESS SQUARE.” (ARUPA.)
AND THESE THREE ENCLOSED WITHIN THE O
(BOUNDLESS CIRCLE), ARE THE SACRED FOUR,
AND THE TEN ARE THE ARUPA (SUBJECTIVE,
FORMLESS) UNIVERSE (c); THEN COME THE
34
“SONS,” THE SEVEN FIGHTERS, THE ONE, THE'
EIGHTH LEFT OUT (d) AND HIS BREATH WHICH
IS THE LIGHT-MAKER (BHASKARA) (e).
(a) “Adi-Sanat.” Literally the First or “prime­
val” ancient. Sanat is a title of Brahma, the Creator.
Compare also Adi-Budlia (Primeval Wisdom) and the1
Kabalistic “Ancient of Days.”
Svdblidvat.” The mystic Essence or plastic root
of physical Nature. Number in its Unity of Substance,
on the highest plane. Buddhist synonym for the four­
fold Anima-Mundi [Almja. See Stanza 1.7a] Occultists-
identify it with “FATHER-MOTHER” [see Stanza
III, 10] on the mystic plane.
(b) “One and Nine” make ten, or the perfect
number applied to the “Creator,” the name given to
the totality of the Creators blended by the Monothe­
ists into One, as the “Elohim,” Adam Kadmon or
Sephira—the Crown—are the androgyne synthesis-
of the 10 Sephiroth, who stand for the symbol of
the manifested Universe in the popularised Kabala.
The esoteric Kabalists, however, following the
Eastern Occultists, divide the upper Sephirothal
triangle from the rest (or Sephira, Chochmah and
Binah), which leaves seven Sephiroth. As for
Svabhavat, the Orientalists explain the term as mean­
ing the Universal plastic matter diffused through
Space, with, perhaps, half an eye to the Ether of
Science.
(c) This means that the “Boundless Circle”
(Zero) becomes a figure or number, only when one
of the nine figures precedes it, and thus manifests,
its value and potency, the Word or Logos in union'
with VOICE and Spirit (the expression and source o f
Consciousness) standing for the nine figures and
thus forming, with the Cypher, the Decad which con­
tains in itself all the Universe. The triad forms within
/
the circle the Tetraktys or Sacred Four, the Square
within the Circle being the most potent of all the
magical figures.
(d) The “eighth left out” is the Sun of our
system. In the Rig Veda the allegory says: “Eight
"Sons were born from the body of Aditi [Mother
“
Space, the Cosmic matrix from which all the heaven­
ly bodies of our system were born] ; she approached
the Gods with seven, but cast away the eighth,
Marttanda,” our Sun. [The great Temple of the Sun
in Kashmir is called Martand.] The Seven Sons,
•called the Aditya, are, cosmically or astronomically,
the Seven Planets; and the Sun being excluded, shows
that the Hindus knew of a seventh planet without
calling it Uranus. The Secret Doctrine teaches that
the Sun is a central Star, not a planet. Yet the An­
cients knew of and worshipped seven great gods, ex­
cluding the Sun and Earth.
“The Seven allow mortals to see their dwellings”
[visible planets] “but show themselves only to the
Arhats,” says an old proverb. [One has only to read
what one of these Arhats (the Initiate K.H.) says
of the true nature of the Sun and Planets, to realise
the limitations of exoteric Astronomy which can only
see the “dwellings.”—M.L. lfc&
. et seg.]
The Occult Doctrine rejects the hypothesis born out
of the Nebular Theory of Laplace that the (seven)
great planets have evolved from the Sun’s central mass,
not of this our visible Sun, at any rate. The first con­
densation of Cosmic matter of course took place about
a central nucleus, its parent Sun; but our sun, it is"
taught, merely detached itself [or, rather, as we have
seen above, was detached] earlier than all the others, as
the rotating mass contracted, ana is their elder, big­
ger brother therefore, not their father. Replying to
the question of a student, H.P.B. said:
35
36
The “One Rejected” is the Sun of our system
which is older than any of the planets, though
younger than the Moon. When bodies or planets
began to form, helped by its rays, magnetic radiance
or heat, and especially by its magnetic attraction, it
had to be stopped, otherwise it would have swallowed
all the younger bodies, as Saturn is fabled to have
treated his progeny. The planets are not thrown
out by the Sun, as modern Science teaches, but ac­
quire their growth under its Rays. (T.B.L. II 45).
{cl) The “Breath” of all the “seven” is said
to be Bhaskara (light-making), because they (the
planets) were all comets and suns in their origin.
All began life as comets, detaching themselves from
the world-stuff of the Milky Way {ibid).
Comets Become Suns
Astronomical science seems to know no more
about comets and cometary matter than it did when
the S. D. was written. Sir James Jeans dismisses
them very briefly as debris of a cataclysm destined
to be gradually swept up by the planets. His genealogy
for our system is: “Chaos—Nebula—Sun—Planets—
Satellites.” His theory is that nebulae of the spiral
type throw off by rotation vast masses of gas which
subsequently condense into stars {The Universe
Around Us, p. 206).
In the S.D., on the other hand, we find that the
genealogy is: “Chaos—World-Stuff—Nebulae—Comets
—Sun—Planets.”
The World-Stuff is the first differentiation of the
invisible primeval cosmic matter, visible from our
Earth as the Milky Way [the “Curds” of Stanza III].
The way in which suns and planets are formed from
this material is thus described by H. P. B. in reply
to a student’s question: “Were all the planets in our
Solar System first comets and then suns?” :—
37
“They were not suns in our, or in their present
.solar systems, but comets in space. All began life as
'wanderers’ (comets) over the face of the infinite
Kosmos. They detached themselves from the common
storehouse of the already prepared material, the Milky
Way (which is nothing more than the quite developed
world-stuff, all the rest in space being the crude ma­
terial, as yet invisible to us). Then, starting on their
dong journey, they first settled in life where condi­
tions were prepared for them by Folmt, and gradual­
ly became suns. Then each sun, when its Pralaya
arrived, was resolved into millions and millions of
fragments. Each of these fragments moved to and
fro in space collecting fresh materials, as it rolled on,
like an avalanche, until it came to a stop through the
laws of attraction and repulsion, and became a planet
in our own, as in other systems, beyond our telescopes.
The Sun’s fragments will become just such planets
after the Solar Pralaya. It was a comet once upon a
time, in the beginning of Brahma’s Age [See Part II,
Stanzalll, “Brahmin Chronology”]. Then it came to
its present position, whence it will burst asunder, and
its atoms will be whirled into space for aeons and
aeons, like all other comets and meteors, until each,
guided by Karma, is caught in the vortex of the two
forces, and fixed in some higher and better system.
“Thus the Sun will live in his children as a por­
tion of the parents lives in their offspring. When
that day comes, the semblance or reflection of the
Sun which we see [i.e. what appears to us to be the
real sun] will first fall off like a veil from the face
■
of the true Sun. No mortal will see it, for no mortal
eye could bear its radiance. Were this veil once re­
moved for even a second, all the planets of its system
would be instantaneously reduced to ashes, as the sixty
3
8
thousand of King’s Sagara’s Sons were destroyed by
a glance of Kapila’s eye.”—T.B.L. II, 45.
For further information concerning the Puranie
allegory of Kapila’s Eye and the terrible sidereal
force it represents, see Part II, Stanza XII, “Aero­
planes used by the Atlanteans.”
Dr. Harlow Shapley, Director of Harvard Ob­
servatory, stated in December, 1929, that among “the
nine major mysteries” are: “the birthplace of the
comets,” the “source of energy that runs the Uni­
verse” and “the sources of the shooting stars.” All
these are explained in the Secret Doctrine, as I en­
deavour to show in this brief summary. Science has
observed that the tenuity of cometary matter is
shown by the phenomenon of the tail, which, as it ap­
proaches the Sun, is thrown out as much as ninety
million miles in a few hours, but always away from
the Sun “by some repulsive force, probably electrical”
(I, 504). This is explained by the statement that “the
Sun is neither a solid nor a liquid nor yet a
gaseous glow, but a gigantic ball of electro­
magnetic Forces, the storehouse of universal life and
motion” (M. L. 165). The flames regarded as
“vapour” and “gases” are “simply magnetic matter
in its usual state of activity, the magneto-electric
aura, the phlogiston of the Sun” {ibid.) An­
other point to bear in mind is that there is here no-
gravitation properly speaking, only attraction and re­
pulsion, as in the above case of the comet’s tail.
We are told (S.D. I, 203) that the way in which
a comet gets started on its career, is, that a nucleus
of primordial substance is informed on/‘fired up” by
the freed principles of a just deceased sidereal body
(Fohat guiding the transfer; See p. 43) , and whirls-
off into space in order to strengthen its homogeneous
39
organism by an accumulation and addition of differ­
entiated elements. The tail is a result of its great
velocity. Those which move slower and are propelled
into an elliptic course are doomed to annihilation
sooner or later. Others moving in parabolic curves
.generally escape destruction, owing to their velocity.
This is a teaching as old as the Rishis, but astronomy,
as w
re have seen, is still as far as ever from accept­
ing any such explanation of the “mystery.” It is
strikingly summarised in the following Occult Com­
mentary, which, if carefully analysed and reflected
upon, will be found as scientific as Science could make
it:
“The Central Sun causes Fohat to collect pri­
mordial dust in the form of balls, to impel them to
move in converging lines and finally to approach
each other and aggregate” (Book of Dzyan) . . . “Be­
ing scattered in Space, without order or system, the
world-germs come into frequent collision until their
final aggregation, after which they become Wander­
ers (Comets). Then the battles and struggles begin.
The older (bodies) attract the younger, while others
repel them. Many perish, devoured by their stronger
companions. Those that escape become worlds.”

Lipika. Lit. the Scribes, from lipi (writing).
The Recorders who, under the Law of Karma, im­
press on the (to us) invisible tablets of the Astral
Light a faithful record of every act, and even
thought, of man; of all that was, is, or ever will be,

connection with photography, radium, etc., tend to
prove that the existence of the Eternal Record or
Book of Life is not a fantastic dream but a scientific
fact.]
Before we come to the next Stanza on the pro­
cesses of world formation, the following is important
to bear in mind: The Nebular Theory of Laplace, re­
cently abandoned by science, is discussed in S. D. I,.
Part III, 588 et seq., where the French astronomer
Wolf is quoted as saying in 1886 (Hypotheses
Cosmogoniques) that this theory “does not regard the
Comets as involved in that particular evolution which
has produced the Solar System.” The Esoteric
doctrine, on the contrary, does, because it, too, re­
cognises the Comets as forms of cosmic existence co~
ordinated with the earlier stages of Nebular evolution?
and [as explained ante] it actually assigns to them
chiefly the formation of all worlds (I, 599).
ST A N Z A V.
HOW A WORLD IS FORMED
In this Stanza the process of world-formation is des­
cribed:—First, diffused Cosmic Matter, then the “Fiery
Whirlwind,” the first stage in the formation of a nebula.
That nebula condenses, and after passing through various
transformations [e.g. Comets, see ante], forms a Solar
Universe, a Planetary Chain, or a single planet, as the case
may be.
1. THE PRIMORDIAL SEVEN,- THE FIRST SEVEN
BREATHS OF THE DRAGON OF WISDOM, PRODUCE
IN THEIR TURN FROM THEIR HOLY ClRCUMGYRAT­
ING BREATHS THE FIERY WHIRLWIND, (a).
Hegel said that the Unconscious evolved the
Universe only “in the hope of attaining clear self-
consciousness”, of becoming, in other words,
MAN.... The Mind-born Sons, Rishis, Builders, etc.,
were all men—of whatever forms and shapes—in
other worlds and the preceding Manvanlaras. All
intelligences in any world who have reached the
appropriate equilibrium between matter and spirit
are reckoned as human; and we have done this since
the middle point was passed for the Fourth Root
Race [Atlantean] in this, our Fourth, Round.
(a) The “Fiery Whirlwind” is the incandes­
cent Cosmic dust which follows magnetically the
directing thought of the Creative Forces.
Every atom in the Universe has the potentiality
of self-consciousness in it, and is, like the Monad of
41
42
Leibnitz, a Universe in itself, and for itself. It is an
atom and an angel.
The Monad of Leibnitz.
Leibnitz was one of the great metaphysicians of
the seventeenth century, others being Descartes,
Malebranche and Spinoza, who represented different
-aspects of the system known as Cartesianism. Des­
cartes based his sys' em on the axiom Cogito ergo sum
(I think therefore I am). Influenced by the training
■
of the cloister and St. Augustine, the result of his
ethics is ascetic. The passions, like the senses, have
no relation to the 1igher life of the soul, whose seat)
he believed to be the Pineal gland (see Stanza X, v.
42, d, on the Third Eye). Spinoza was a pantheist
with a naturalistic and a mystical side. He postulat­
ed one infinite substance of which all finite existences
are modes or limitations.
To the intuitive perceptions of Leibnitz, how­
ever, “the ultimate elements of the Universe are in­
divisible centres of force which he called Monads
(Monadologie). They are the very atoms of Nature,
the elements of things. They are metaphysical
points, or rather spiritual beings whose very nature
is to act. Every monad is a microcosm, the Universe
in little, and according to the degree of its activity is
the distinctness cf its representation of the Universe”
(Encyclopaedia Brit, on Leibnitz, b. at Leipzig 1646,
d. 1716).
He was an absolute idealist in maintaining that
“material atoms are contrary to reason” (Systeme
Nouveau, Erdmann, p. 126, col. 2). For his matter
was a simple representation of the monad, whether
human or atomic. Monads he thought (as we do);
are everywhere. Thus the human soul is a monad,
and every cell in the human body has its monad, as
43
every cell in animal, vegetable, and even in the (so-
called) inorganic bodies. His discovery that an active
energy forms the essence of Substance is a principle
that places him in direct relationship with the Seers of
the East. See S.D. I, sect. XV on “Gods, Monads,
Atoms.”
Exit the Material Atom of Science.
At the time The Secret Doctrine was written
(1888) western science still regarded the hypothetic­
al atom as the smallest conceivable speck of matter.
Sir James Jeans puts it in his latest work, The
Universe Around Us, (Ch. II, "Exploring the Atom”) :
"All the changes of the universe were supposed to
amount to nothing more drastic than a re-arrange­
ment of permanent indestructible atoms; like a
child’s box of bricks, these built many buildings in
turn. The story of twentieth-century physics is
primarily the story of the shattering of this concept.”
He goes on to say that towards the end of last
century, Crookes, Lenard, and Thomson began to
break up the atom, the last-named showing in 1895
that fragments chipped off were identical: “they
were of equal weight and they carried equal charges
of electricity. On account of this last property they
were called ‘electrons’. . . . Observation shows that
a complete atom carries no charge at all, so that
somewhere in the atom there must be a positive
charge of electricity, of amount just sufficient to
neutralise the combined negative charges of all the
electrons.”
In 1911, as a result of experiments, Rutherford
propounded the theory of a central “nucleus” carry­
ing the necessary positive charge, around which the
negative electrons described orbits. In fact, he re­
garded the atom as a miniature solar system, the nu­
44
cleus being the sun and the electrons the planets.
See Stanza III, v. 12.
Thus, barely twenty years after the author’s
death, we find The Secret Doctrine endorsed on two
important points. First, that the structure of the
atom is essentially electrical and its vortical move­
ment is due to that force (See Part I, Stanza V, on
the action of Fohat, or Cosmic Electricity, on the
atoms). Second, that the atom is a miniature Solar
system, an actual microcosm of the macrocosm (See
S.D. I, sect, XV: Gods, Monads, Atoms). It is there
explained that the Gods are the Egos or conscious
intelligent architects who execute the plan in the
Divine Mind; the Monads are the Elementals who
“form collectively and unconsciously the grand Uni­
versal Mirrors of everything connected with their
respective realm sw hile the Atoms are the material
units which are “informed in their turn by their
apperceptive monads, just as every cell in a human
body is so informed.... Atoms fill the immensity of
Space, and by their continuous vibration are that
Motion which keeps the wheels of Life perpetually
going (See note below^on Einstein’s Quantum
theory). It is that inner work that produces the na­
tural phenomena called the Correlation of Forces,
Only, at the origin of every such ‘force’, there stands
the conscious guiding noumencn thereof—Angel or
God, Spirit or Demon—ruling powers, yet the same”
(632-8) .... The ancient Initiates, who were followed
more or less closely by all profane antiquity,
meant by the term A tom a Soul, a Genius or Angel,
the first-born of the ever-concealed Cause of all
causes; and in this sense their teachings become com­
prehensible. . . . They taught the revolution of the
Heavens, the Earth’s rotation, the Heliocentric
System, and the Atomic Vortices—Atoms—in reality
45
Souls and Intelligences. But those Atomists were
spiritual, most transcendental, and philosophical
Pantheists. It is not they who would ever have con­
ceived or dreamt that monstrous contrasted progeny,
the nightmare of our modern civilized Race namely,
inanimate material, self-guiding atoms on the one
hand, and an extra-Cosmic God on the other” (569).
To convey an idea of the “extreme emptiness of
astronomical space”, Sir James Jeans says that a
few specks of dust in the area of a large railway
station represent the extent to which space is oc­
cupied by stars. Similarly with the atom: a few
wasps in the same area would represent its electrons
(102-2). We learn further that the atom contains,
in addition to electrons and protons, a third ingredi­
ent termed Electro-magnetic energy which can be
thought of as “bottled radiation”. The laws of
Maxwell and Faraday required that “the energy of
an atom should continually decrease, through the
atom scattering the energy abroad in the form of
radiation”, but experiments in what is called “cavity-
radiation” proved that this was not so. In 1900,
Professor Planck cf Berlin “discovered experiment­
ally the law by which ‘cavity-radiation’ is distributed
among the different colours of the spectrum.”
His concept, “sensational, revolutionary, and even
ridiculous, as many thought at the time,” was
in 1917 put in the more precise form known as
Einstein’s Lav/. Einstein supposes that “radiation of
a given type can effect an atomic or molecular
change, only if the energy needed for the change is
46
precisely equal to that of a single ‘quantum’* of the
radiation” (119). This is called the ‘Quantum’ theory.
For reasons which this theory has succeeded in
elucidating, “there are, in every atom, two orbits in
which the energy is equal and lower than in any other
orbit.... Provided the electrons are not being
excited by radiation or other stimulus, each
atom sinks in time to a state in which its
electrons are occupying its orbits of lowest energy,
one in each.” It then “becomes a true perpetual
motion machine. ... It seems astonishing and quite
incomprehensible that an atom in such a state
should net be able to yield up its energy still further,
but, so far as our experience goes, it cannot. And
this property, little though we understand it, is in
the last resort, responsible for keeping the universe
in being. If no restriction of this kind intervened,
the whole material energy of the universe would dis­
appear in the form of radiation in a few thousand-
millionth parts of a secondt.... By prohibiting any
emission of radiation except by complete ‘quanta,’
and by prohibiting any emission at all when there
are no ‘quanta’available for dissipation, the ‘Quantum’
theory succeeds in keeping the universe in existence
as a going concern” (126-7).
*A ‘quantum’, the writer explains, is a certain amount of
energy depending on wave-length. It is supposed to be pro­
portional to the frequency cr number of vibrations of the
radiation per second. The illustration of the automatic penny-
in-the-slot machine is given, the ‘quantum’ being likened to
the coin which must be a certain size and weight to make the
machine work.
fOne of the Oriental Initiates writes: “The ruin of the
Solar System occurs in the twinkling of an eye, but not with­
out many preliminary warnings” (M.L. 99). The same ex­
pression is used in Revelation, which is a Book of Initiation
in symbolical language based on the ancient Mysteries.
47
Sir James thinks that the realities underlying these
phenomena “may well he so fundamental as to be be­
yond the grasp of the human mind.” But The Secret
Doctrine asserts: “The exact extent, depth, breadth,
and length of the mysteries of Nature are to be found
only in the Eastern esoteric sciences. ■So vast and
so profound are these that hardly a few, a very few
of the highest Initiates—whose very existence is
known but to a small number of Adepts—are capable
of assimilating the knowledge. Yet it is all there,
and one by one the facts and processes in Nature’s
workshops are permitted to find their way into the
exact Sciences, while mysterious help is given to rare
individuals in unravelling its arcana*. We are at the
close of the cycle of [the first] 5,000 years of the pre­
sent Aryan Kali Yuga (Iron or Black Age) ; and be­
tween this time (1888) and 1897 there will be a large
rent made in the Veil of Nature, and materialistic
science will receive a death-blow” (I, 612). The dis­
coveries relating to the atom, which began in 1895,
may be regarded as one example of the fulfilment of
this prediction.
Electro-Magnetism, Radiation and Relativity.
Let us now turn to Mr. James Rice’s booklet on
Relativity: An Exposition Without Mathematics for
some further interesting information regarding the
electrical constitution of the atom and its important
*Eor example, in Rice’s popular booklet on Relativity he
says: “Einstein had, by one those flashes of insight which are
the prerogative of genius, realised that something deeper than
suitable hypotheses about the properties of matter or skilful
mathematical analysis was involved.” Such inspiration can
come either from the person’s own higher Ego, or from the
mind of a more advanced being who knows how to transmit
Shis knowledge by a telepathic process. There are many Ori­
ental Initiates who can do this.
48
bearing on the breakdown of the materialism of the
nineteenth century foreshadowed by The Secret
Doctrine. He tells us (p. 47) that Clerk-Maxwell,
soon after the middle of the nineteenth century, pre-
dieted that “electro-magnetic waves” should be cap­
able of propagation through space; but it was near­
ly twenty years before Hertz actually produced the
first “wireless waves” at Munich.
“Nowadays we are so far from worrying about
a material ether as a transmitter of a mechanical
radiation that we actually regard radiation as an
entity in itself, requiring no medium for its trans­
mission, having an independent' existence quite as
real as that of an atom or electron” (p. 48). Cf.
Stanza V, v. 2 “Various Aspects of Fohat,” where
it is stated that, as the “personified electric vital
power,” Fohat is “looked upon by the Occultists as
an entity.”
The nuclei and electrons “are really minute por­
tions of positive and negative electricity whose move­
ments within the atom give rise to the waves. Each
atom is a minute ‘broadcasting station’, emitting
electro-magnetic waves, each type of atom having its
own characteristic wave-lengths or frequencies. . .
These structural details of the atom which give rise
to radiation are, we now believe, also responsible for
those forces of ‘affinity and cohesion’ (Cf. Stanza V,
v. 4 (a) “Fohat...the electric Power of affinity and
sympathy”) which bind the atoms in the molecule,
the molecules in the solid body, as well as the electrons
and nuclei in the atom. So there is an electro-magnetic
origin for the forces exhibited in the constitution of
matter as well as in the propagation of radiation”
(P- 49).
“Relativity could not have arisen apart from the
electro-magnetic theories of Light and Matter, and so
49
anyone hoping to understand it should have some
idea of the results of the impact on the traditional
materialism of the nineteenth century made by Clerk-
Maxwell” (p. 53).
“When Einstein began in 1905 to consider the
repercussions of the idea of ‘relative motion’ on our
notions of Space, Time, Inertia, Light, and Electro­
magnetism, he found that the postulate that the forces
involved in the constitution of matter are of electro­
magnetic origin was entirely consistent with his
views. One phenomenon alone appeared to stand out­
side—Gravitation—
if Newton’s law were absolutely
true. This difficulty he ultimately conquered by dis­
covering a law of gravitation which is just a little
more accurate than Newton’s, and which, by com­
pletely abolishing the notion of gravitation as an ‘ac­
tion at a distance’, makes its absorption into the Re­
lativity scheme quite feasible. This about 1915” (54).
How nearly the more intuitive scientific minds
are now approaching the Esoteric philosophy may be
seen in the following passage from Professor Edding­
ton’s Space, Time and Gravitation: “The theory of
Relativity has passed in review the whole subject of
physics. It has unified the great laws which by their
position hold a proud place in knowledge, and yet
this is by itself an empty shell. The reality is in our
cwn consciousness. There are menial aspects deep
unthin the world of physics. We have only regained
from Nature what man has put into Nature. Every­
thing is relative to human perception.” (Italics mine.

i.e„ HE IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THEIR

NING THROUGH THE FIERY CLOUDS (COSMIC
MISTS) (6), TAKES THREE, AND FIVE, AND SEVEN
STRIDES THROUGH THE SEVEN REGIONS ABOVE
AND THE SEVEN BELOW (THE WORLD TO BE).
HE LIFTS HIS VOICE, AND CALLS THE INNUMER­
ABLE SPARKS (ATOMS) AND JOINS THEM TOGE­
THER (c).
(a) This shows the “Primordial Seven” using1
for their Vahcin (vehicle) or the manifested subject
which becomes the symbol of the Power directing it),
Fohat, called in consequence the “Messenger of their
will”—the fiery whirlwind.
[The difference between the “Builders,” the Plane­
tary Spirits, and the Lipika must not be lost sight of.
See v. 6 (a) and S.D. I, 128].
(b) Dzyu is the Tibetan term for the one real
(magical) knowledge, or Occult Wisdom, dealing
with eternal truths and primal causes. Dzyu-mi is its
antithesis, dealing with illusions, as in our exoteric
sciences.
Dzyu is the collective wisdom of the DhycLni-
Buddlias. Esoterically, there are seven of these (cor­
responding to the Seven Root Races) of whom five
(we are in the Fifth Root Race) have manifested,
and two are to come in the Sixth and Seventh Root
Races. They are the eternal prototypes of the
Buddhas who appear on Earth for each Race, and
Avaloltitesumra (the Third Logos) is their synthesis.
(Sec: Buddhism the Science of Life, Appendix).
(c) The “three and seven” strides refer to the
Seven spheres inhabited by man, of the Esoteric Doc­
trine, as Well as to the Seven regions of the Earth
. . . .The Seven Worlds or spheres of our planetary
51
chain are distinctly referred to in the exoteric Hindu
scriptures; e.g. the “the three strides of Vishnu”
through the “seven regions of the Universe” in the
Rig Veda.
The Seven was a Sacred Number with every na­
tion, but none applied it to more physiologically ma­
terialistic uses than the Hebrews.
3. HE IS THEIR GUIDING SFIRIT AND LEADER.
WHEN HE COMMENCES WORK, HE SEPARATES
THE SPARKS OF THE LOWER KINGDOM (MINERAL
ATOMS) THAT FLOAT AND THRILL WITH JOY IN
THEIR RADIANT DWELLINGS (GASEOUS CLOUDS),
AND FORMS THEREWITH THE GERMS OF
WHEELS. HE PLACES THEM IN THE SIX DIREC­
TIONS OF SPACE AND ONE IN THE MIDDLE—THE
CENTRAL WHEEL, (a).
(a) “Wheels” are the centres of force, around
which primordial Cosmic matter expands, and, pas­
sing through all the six stages of consolidation, be­
comes spheroidal and ends by being transformed into
globes or spheres. . .This law of vortical movement in
primordial matter is one of the oldest conceptions of
Greek philosophy, whose first historical Sages were
nearly all Initiates of the Mysteries.
By the “Six directions of Space” is meant the
“Double Triangle,” symbol of the junction and blend­
ing of pure Spirit and Matter.
The Various Aspects of Fohat.
Fokat is an occult Tibetan term for Daioiprakriti
(Primordial Light), and is a Turanian compound.
In China Pho or Fo is the word for “animal soul,” the
vital Nephesh or the breath of life. Some say ihat it
is derived from the Sanskrit Bhu, meaning existence,
or rather the essence of existence. Now Swayarnbhu
5
2
means Brahma and Man at the same time. It means
self-existence and self-existing, that which is e’-ec-
lasting, the Eternal Breath. If Sat is the potentiality
of Being, Plio is the potency of Being. The meaning,
however, entirely depends upon the position of the
accent.
Again, Foliat is related to Mahat. It is the re­
flection of the Universal Mind, the synthesis of the
“Seven” and the, intelligences of the seven creative
Builders, or, as we call them, Cosmocratores. Hence,
as you will understand, life and electricity are one
in our philosophy. They say electricity is life, and
if so, then the One Life is the essence and root of all
the electric and magnetic phenomena on this mani­
fested plane.—T.B.L. II, 6.
Fohat is the key in Occultism which opens and
unriddles the multiform symbols and respective al­
legories in the so-called mythology of every nation;
demonstrating the wonderful philosophy and the deep
insight into the mysteries of Nature in the Egyptian
and Chaldean as well as in the Aryan religions. Fohat,
shown in his true character, proves how deeply versed
were all those prehistoric nations in every science
of Nature, now called physical and chemical branches
of natural philosophy. In the Egyptian papyri
the whole Cosmogony of the Secret Doctrine is found
scattered about in isolated sentences, even in the
Book of the Dead. Number Seven is quite as much
insisted on as in the Book of Dzyan... Both Fohat
and Toum are addressed as the “Great ones of the
Seven Magic Forces,” who “conquer the Serpent
Apap,” or Matter.—s.d. I, 674. See also Stanza VI,
v. 4 (b).
Fohat is a generic term and used in many senses.
He is the light (Daiviprakriti) of all the three Logoi—
the personified symbols of the three spiritual stages
5
3
of Evolution. Fohat is the aggregate of all the
spiritual creative ideations above, and of all the
electro-dynamic and creative forces below, in Heaven
and on Earth. There seems to be great confusion
and misunderstanding concerning the First and Se­
cond Logos. The First is the already present yet
still unmanifested potentiality in the bosom of Father-
Mother; the Second is the abstract collectivity of
creators called “Demiurgi” by the Greeks, or the
Builders of the Universe. The Third Logos is the
ultimate differentiation of the Second, and the in­
dividualization of Cosmic Forces of which Fohat is
the chief; for Fohat is the synthesis of the Seven
Creative Rays or Dhyan Chohans which proceed from
the Third Logos.—T.B.L. I, 33. Ans. to Qn. “Is B^ohat
one of the Three:—Father, Mother and Son?”
When the “Divine Son” breaks forth, then Fohat
becomes the propelling force, the active Power which
causes the One to become Two and Three—on the
Cosmic plane of manifestation. The triple One dif­
ferentiates into the many, and then Fohat is trans­
formed into that force which brings together the ele­
mental atoms and makes them aggregate and combine
(I, 109).
The “Sons of Fohat” are the various Forces hav­
ing fohatic, or cosmic electric life in their essence or
being, and in their various effects.
Fohat, then, is the personified electric vital power,
the transcendental binding Unity of all Cosmic
Energies, on the unseen as on the manifested planes,
the action of which resembles—on an immense scale—
that of a living Force created by Will, in those
phenomena where the seemingly subjective acts on
the seemingly objective and propels it to action.
54
Fohat is not only the living Symbol and Con­
tainer of that Force, but is looked upon by the Oc­
cultists as an Entity—the forces he acts on being
cosmic, human and terrestrial, and exercising their
influence on all those planes respectively... In his
his secondary aspect, Fohat is the Solar Energy, the
electric vital fluid, and the preserving fourth prin­
ciple, the animal Soul of Nature, so to say, or—Elec­
tricity (111). Fohat’s “three, five and seven strides”
refer to the seven spheres of the Esoteric Doctrine,
inhabited by man, as well as to the seven regions of
the Earth (112).
The Sun we see gives nothing of itself because
it is a reflection, a bundle of electro-magnetic forces,
one of the countless milliards of “Knots of Fohat.”
Fohat is called the “Thread of Primeval Light,” the
“Ball of thread” of Ariadne, indeed, in this labyrinth
of chaotic matter. This thread runs through the
seven planes, tying itself into knots. Every plane be­
ing septenary, there are thus forty-nine mystical and
physical forces, larger knots forming stars, suns and
systems, the smaller, planets, and so on.—T.B.L. II,
24. [These “Knots” are mentioned by Jeans at p.
199].
Electricity, on our plane, is one of the most com­
prehensive aspects of the universal primordial fire. . .
But the electricity which is seen, for instance, in an
electric lamp, is quite another thing from Fohat.—•
Ibid. 27.
From an Occult standpoint, electric phenomena
are very often produced by the abnormal state of the
mplecules of an object or of bodies in space: electri­
city is life and it is death : the first being produced by
harmony, the second by disharmony. Vital electri­
city is under the same laws as cosmic electricity. The
combination of molecules into new forms, and the
5
5
bringing about of new correlations and disturbance of
molecular equilibrium is, in general, the work of, and
generates, Fohat.—Ibid, 28.
4. FOHAT TRACES SPIRAL LINES TO UNITE THE SIX
TO THE SEVENTH—THE CROWN (a); AN ARMY
OF THE SONS OF LIGHT STANDS AT EACH ANGLE
(AND) THE LIPIKA—IN THE MIDDLE WHEEL.
THEY (THE LIPIKA) SAT, “THIS IS GOOD” (6).
THE FIRST DIVINE WORLD IS READY, THE FIRST
(IS NOW), THE SECOND (WORLD), THEN THE
“DIVINE ARUPA” (THE FORMLESS UNIVERSE OF
THOUGHT) REFLECTS ITSELF IN CHHAYALOKA
(THE SHADOWY WORLD OF PRIMAL FORM, OR
THE INTELLECTUAL) THE FIRST GARMENT OF
(THE) ANUPADAKA (c).
(а) This tracing of “Spiral lines” refers to the
evolution of man’s as well as Nature’s principles.
Fohat, in his capacity of Divine Love (Eros), the
electric Power of affinity and sympathy, is shown
allegorically as trying to bring the pure Spirit (Atrna,
the 7th principle), the Ray inseparable from the ONE
Absolute, into union with the Soul (Buddki, the 6th),
the two constituting in Man the Monad, and in Na­
ture the first link between the ever unconditioned and
the manifested.
(б) The “Army” at each angle is the Host of
angelic Beings (Dhyan-Chohans) appointed to guide
and watch over each respective region from the be­
ginning to the end of the Manvanlara.
The “First is the Second” because the “First”
cannot really be numbered or regarded as the First,
as that is the realm of noumena in its primary mani­
festation.
(c) The “Divine World”—the countless Lights
lit at the primeval Light—the Buddhis, or formless
divine Souls of the last Arwpa (formless) world...

The radical Unity of the ultimate essence of each
constituent part of the compounds in Nature, is the
one fundamental law in Occult Science, and applies
to the Spiritual, Intellectual (Manasic), and Physical
worlds.
There is a deep philosophy underlying the earliest
worship in the world, that of the Sun and of Fire.
Of all the Elements known to physical science, Fire
is the one that has ever eluded definite analysis. ..
Professor Bain says {Logic. Part II) : “The lighting
of a fire by a flame is a great scientific difficulty,
yet few people think so” (p. 125). What says the
esoteric teaching with regard to Fire? “Fire,” it
says, “is the most perfect and unadulterated reflec­
tion, in Heaven as on Earth, of the On e F lam e. It
is Life and Death, the origin and the end of every
material thing. It is Divine ‘Su bstance’.” . . . The
Rosicrucians, among all the mystics and Kabalists,
were those who defined Fire in the right and most
correct way.
5. FOHAT TAKES FIVE STRIDES (HAVING ALREADY
TAKEN THE FIRST THREE) (a), AND BUILDS A
WINGED WHEEL AT EACH CORNER OF THE
SQUARE FOR THE FOUR HOLY O N E S ___ AND
THEIR ARMIES (HOSTS) (6).
(a) The “strides” refer to both the Cosmic and
the Human principles—the latter of which consist,
in the exoteric division, of three (Spirit, Soul, and
Body), and, in the esoteric calculation, of seven prin­
ciples—three rays of the Essence and four aspects.
There are two Esoteric Schools—or rather one divid­
ed into two parts—
one for the inner Lanoos (Tibetan
disciples), the other for the outer or semi-lay chelas
beyond the Himalayas [India. See Preface to The
Voice of the Silence] the first teaching a septenary,
the other a sixfold division of human principles.
5
7
Cosmieally the ‘five strides” refer to the five
upper planes of Consciousness and Being-, the two
lower being the astral and terrestrial.
(6) “Four winged wheels” should read “a
winged wheel,” these being the “Four Maharajahs”
op great Kings of the Dhyan-Chohans who rule over
the Cosmical Forces of North, South, East and West,
each with its distinct occult property. These Beings
are also connected with Karma, as the latter needs
physical agents to carry out her decrees, such as the
four kinds of winds, professedly admitted by Science
to have their respective evil and beneficent influences
upon the health of Mankind and every living thing.
6. THE L1P1KA CIRCUMSCRIBE THE TRIANGLE, THE
FIRST ONE (THE VERTICAL LINE OR THE
FIGURE 1.), THE CUBE, THE SECOND ONE, AND
THE PENTACLE WITHIN THE EGG (CIRCLE) (a).
IT IS THE RING CALLED “PASS NOT,” FOR THOSE
WHO DESCEND AND ASCEND (AS ALSO FOR
THOSE) WHO DURING THE KALPA, ARE PRO­
GRESSING TOWARD THE GREAT DAY “BE WITH
US” (b) ---- THUS WERE FORMED THE ARUPA
AND THE RUPA (THE FORMLESS WORLD AND
THE WORLD OF FORMS) ; FROM ONE LIGHT
SEVEN LIGHTS; FROM EACH OF THE SEVEN,
SEVEN TIMES SEVEN LIGHTS. THE “WHEELS”
WATCH THE RING.
(а) The esoteric meaning is that the Lipika,
who are Recorders of the Karmic ledger, make an
impassable barrier between the personal E go and the
impersonal Self, the Noumenon and Parent-Source
of the former. They circumscribe the manifested
world of matter within the Ring “Pass-Not.”
(б) Those who “descend and ascend”—the in­
carnating Monads, and men striving towards puri­
fication and “ascending1
,” but still not having quite
reached the goal—may cross the circle of the “Pass-
Not” only on the day “Be-With-Us” ; that day when
man, freeing him,self from the trammels of ignor­
ance, and recognising fully the non-separateness of
the Ego within his personality from the UNIVERSAL
EGO (Anima Supra-Mundi), merges thereby into the
One Essence to become not only one “with us” (the
manifested universal lives which are “one” l if e ),
but that very life itself.

STANZA VI
KWAN-YIN MOTHER OF MERCY.
The subsequent stages in the formation of a “World” are
indicated in this Stanza, which brings the evolution of such
■a world down to its fourth great period, coresponding to the
period in which we are now living.
1. BY THE POWER OF THE MOTHER OF MERCY AND
KNOWLEDGE (a), KWAN-YIN, THE “TRIPLE” OF
' KWAN-SHI-YIN, RESIDING IN KWAN-YIN-TIEN
(6), FOILAT, THE BREATH OF THEIR PROGENY,
THE SON OF THE SONS, HAVING CALLED FORTH
FROM THE LOWER ABYSS (CHAOS) THE ILLUSIVE
FORM OF SIEN-TCHAN (OUR UNIVERSE) AND THE
SEVEN ELEMENTS:—
(a) The Mother of Mercy and Knowledge is
called “the triple” of Kwan-Shi-Yin because in her
correlations, metaphysical and cosmical, she is the
'“Mother, the Wife and the Daughter” of the Logos,
just as in the later theological translations she be­
came “the Father, Son and (the female) Holy Ghost”
—the Sakti or Energy—the Essence of the three. In
the Trans-Himalayan teachings—in the hierarchy
of allegorical and metaphysical theogony—she is the
M other or abstract, ideal matter, Mulaprakriti, the
Root of Nature.
It is only in Asiatic Buddhism and the Egyptian
religion that the female deities Kwan-Yin and Isis
are found on a par with the male. Esotericism ignores
both sexes. Its highest Deity is sexless as it is form­
less, neither Father nor Mother; and its first mani-
5
9
6
0
fested beings, celestial and tei'restrial alike, become
only gradually androgynous and finally separate into
distinct sexes. [The student should carefully note
this process of degeneration and materialisation in
religious beliefs which accompanies the fall of man­
kind into matter, as related in the course of the Ar­
chaic Stanzas (See Part II Anthrorogenesis'). An­
other important point is that this Stanza is translat­
ed from the Chinese text, and that all these Stanzas
are from either Tibetan or Chinese originals, not.
Indian or Egyptian. In fact, the footnote here says
that the Brahmanical doctrine has no equivalent for
the real esoteric nomenclature in this Stanza].
(b) Kwan-Yin-Tien means the “melodious
Heaven of Sound,” the abode of Kwan-Yin (lit.
“Divine Voice,” a synonym of the Verbum or “Word,”
the Hindu Vach, Goddess of Speech). Both represent
the magic 'potency of Occult sound in Nature and
Ether, which “Voice” calls forth Hsien-Ch’an, the
illusive form of the Universe, out of Chaos and the
Seven Elements. (The learned Vedantin Esotericist
T. Subba Row, B.A., B.L. says in his Lecture on the
Bhagavad Gita: “The whole Kosmos in its objective
form is Vaikhai-Vdch.”)
The popular exoteric worship of Amida or
Amitabha and Kwan-Yin in China and Japan, cor­
responds to that of Jesus Christ in orthodox Chris­
tianity ; but the latter entirely neglects the symbolical
and metaphysical aspects briefly summarised above,,
which are wellknown to all educated Buddhists,
whether priests or laymen.
2. THE SWIFT AND THE RADIANT ONE PRODUCES
THE SEVEN LAYU (a) CENTRES, AGAINST WHICH
NONE WILL PREVAIL TO THE GREAT DAY “BE
WITH US”—AND SEATS THE UNIVERSE ON THESE
ETERNAL FOUNDATIONS, SURROUNDING HSIEN-
CFI’AN WITH ELEMENTARY GERMS (6).
6
1
(a) The seven Layu centres are the seven Zero
points, using the term Zero in the same sense that
Chemists do, to indicate a point at which, in Esoteri-
cism, the scale of reckoning of differentiation begins.
Layu (Tib.), from the Sanskrit Laya, is the point of
matter where every differentiation has ceased.
(5) The “Elementary Germs” with which he
fills Hsien Ch’an (The “Universe”) from Tien-Hsin
(lit. the “Heaven of Mind”, or that which is absolute)
are the Atom)! of Science and the Monads of Leibnitz.
See Stanza V. v. 1 (a).
■
3. OF THE SEVEN (ELEMENTS)—FIRST ONE MANI­
FESTED, SIX CONCEALED; TWO MANIFESTED—
FIVE CONCEALED; THREE MANIFESTED—FOUR
CONCEALED; FOUR PRODUCED—THREE HIDDEN;
FOUR AND ONE TSAN (FRACTION) REVEALED—
TWO AND ONE HALF CONCEALED; SIX TO BE
MANIFESTED—ONE LAID ASIDE (a). LASTLY,
SEVEN SMALL WHEELS REVOLVING; ONE GIVING
BIRTH TO THE OTHER (6).
(a) Although these Stanzas refer to the whole
Universe after a Mahapralaya (universal destruction),
yet this sentence, as any student of Occultism may
see, refers also by analogy to the evolution and final
formation of the primitive (though compound) Seven
Elements on our Earth. Of these, four elements are
now fully manifested, while the fifth—Ether—is only
partially so, as we are hardly in the second half of
the Fourth Round, and consequently the fifth Element
wall only manifest fully in the Fifth Round.
(b) The process referred to as “the small
wheels giving birth, one to the other,” takes place
in the sixth region from above and on the plane of
the most material world of all in the manifested
Kosmos—our terrestrial plane. These “Seven
Wheels” are our Planetary Chain (See 5 and 6 post).
62
By “Wheels” the various spheres and centres of forces
are generally meant; but in this case they refer to
our septenary ring [i.e., Chain of Globes].
4. HE BUILDS THEM IN THE LIKENESS OF OLDER
WHEELS (WORLDS), PLACING THEM ON THE 1M-
, PERISHABLE CENTRES (a).
HOW DOES FOHAT BUILD THEM1 HE COL­
LECTS THE FIERY DUST. HE MAKES BALLS OF
FIRE, RUNS THROUGH THEM AND ROUND THEM,
INFUSING LIFE THEREINTO; THEN SETS THEM
INTO MOTION, SOME ONE, SOME THE OTHER WAY.
THEY ARE COLD—HE MAKES THEM HOT. THEY
ARE DRY—HE MAKES THEM MOIST. THEY SHINE
—HE FANS AND COOLS THEM (6).
THUS ACTS FOHAT FROM ONE TWILIGHT
TO THE OTHER DURING SEVEN ETERNITIES [See
Stanza I, 1, a].
(а) The Worlds are built “in the likeness of
older Wheels”, i.e., those that existed in preceding
Manvantaras and went into Pralaya, because the Law
for the birth, growth, and decay of everything in
Kosmos, from the Sun to the glow-worm in the grass,
is On e . . . “The imperishable centres” have a great
importance, and their meaning must be fully under­
stood if we would have a clear conception of the
Archaic Cosmogony, whose theories have now passed
into Occultism.
(б) Bear in mind that Fohat, the constructive
Force of Cosmic Electricity, is said, metaphorically,
to have sprung like Rudra frcm Brahma, “from the
brain of the Father and the bosom of the Mother”,
and then to have metamorphosed himself into a male
and a female, i.e., polarity, into positive and negative
electricity. His Seven “Sons-Brothers” represent and
personify the seven forms of Cosmic magnetism called
in practical Occultism the “Seven Badicals” whose
co-operative and active progeny are, among other
63
energies, Electricity, Magnetism, Sound, Light, Heat,
Cohesion, etc... It is Fohat who guides the transfer
-of the principles from one planet to the other, from
one star to another—child-star. When a plaint dies,
its informing principles are transferred to a laya or
sleeping centre, with potential but latent energy in it,
'which is thus awakened into life and begins to form
itself into a new sidereal body. [See Comets, ante p.
36].
The Law of Analogy in the plan of structure
"between the trans-Solar systems and the intra-Solar
planets, does not necessarily bear upon the finite con­
ditions to which every visible body is subject in this
our plane of being. In Occult Science this law is
the first and most important key to Cosmic physics;
but it has to be studied in its minutest details and,
“to be turned seven times” before one comes to under­
stand it. Occult philosophy is the only science that
can teach it (150).
Here ends that portion of the Stanzas relating
to the Universal Cosmogony after the last Maha-
pralaya or Universal Destruction, which, when it
comes, sweeps out of Space every differentiated thing,
Gods as atoms, like so many dry leaves.... Those
which follow in Vol. I refer only to the evolution of,
and on, our Earth.
[The explanations of the Stanzas are, therefore,
interrupted at this point, and forty pages are devoted
to the corrections of certain errors and misconcep­
tions in books by early students who had misunder­
stood the teachings given to them. This section con­
tains much valuable information and will repay very
careful study. Only a few points of outstanding im­
portance are included in the present summary for
the guidance of the student.]
64
Septenary System in the Universe and Man
Although there are seven principles in man,
there are but three distinct Upadhis (bases or
vehicles) in each of which his Atm a [7th or
highest divine principle] may work independently of
the rest. These three can be separated by an Adept
without killing himself. He cannot separate the
seven principles from each other without destroying
his constitution (From an article by the Vedantin
T. Subba Row). The Esoteric Buddhist system
enumerates seven principles, the Vedantic six, and
the Taraka Raja■Yoga four; the only difference being
in a separate enumeration of the TJpadhis. As every
Adept in Cis-Himalayan or Trans-Himalavan India
(Tibet) of the Patanjali, the Arydsanga or the
Mahayana schools, has to become a Raja Yogi, 'he
must, therefore, accept the Taraka Raja classification
in principle and theory, whatever classification he
resorts to for practical arid occult purposes. Thus,,
it matters very little whether one speaks of three
Upadhis with their three aspects and Atma, the
eternal and immortal synthesis, or calls them the
“seven principles” (157).
The teaching as to the Septenary Chains of
Worlds in the Solar Cosmos is briefly thus (158) :—
1. Everything in the metaphysical as in the
physical Universe is septenary. Hence every sidereal
body, every planet, whether visible or invisible, is
credited with six companion globes. The evolution
of life proceeds on these seven globes or bodies from
the 1st to the 7th in Seven Rounds or Seven Cycles.
2. These globes are formed by a process which
the Occultists call the “rebirth of planetary chains
(or rings).” Each planet of the chain, when its hour
of dissolution comes, transfers its life and energy to
THE SEVEN STATES OR PLANES OP COSMIC
CONSCIOUSNESS.
The Divine and Formless world of Spirit, corresponding to
man's Higher Self (Atmn-Buddhi-Manas), is represented by the
Triangle in the three higher planes. Our Septenary Planetary
Chain occupies the four lower planes; Globe D, our Earth, being
by itself on the lowest or purely material plane, while the others
are in pairs on the other three. There are seven Rounds of
evolution from A to G, and seven Root Races in each Round.
We are now in the Fifth Root Race of the Fourth Round on
Globe D. It should be clearly understood that these seven globes
are not separate, but interpenetrate each other, so that only
globe D of any chain is visible. Similarly in Man, the Microcosm,
his seven principles, corresponding to these seven globes, make
up the one being whose physical body only is visible.
• '
65
another as the Moon did to our Earth [Globe D, or
the 4th of the seven.]
3. Our Earth, as the visible representative of
its invisible superior fellow globes, its “lords” or
“principles,” has to live, as have the others, through
seven Rounds.
4. Its Humanity developes fully only in thei
Fourth, our present Round, in which Man is the first
form to appear, [instead of the last, as Science errone­
ously deduces from external evidence, such as prehis­
toric skulls, which has only taken them back to the
early part of the present Fifth (Aryan) Race].
5. Every life-cycle on Globe D [our Earth] is
composed of seven Root Races. They commence with
the Ethereal and end with the Spiritual on the double
line of physical and moral evolution, from the
beginning of the terrestrial Round to its close. (See
Esoteric Buddhism. By A. P. Sinnett).
6. The First Root Race, i.e., the first “men” on
earth (irrespective of form) were the progeny of the;
“celestial men”, called rightly in Indian philosophy
the “Lunar Ancestors”, or the Pitris, of which there
are seven classes or Hierarchies.
Summary of the Principles.
The following are some of the more important
points in this section (177) :
E verything in th e U niverse follows analogy.
“As above, so below;” Ma n IS THE MICROCOSM OF THE
U niverse. In him meet the three great streams of
evolution which make him the complex being he now
is, namely (181) :
1. The Monadic or Spiritual, represented by
the 7th principle Atma and its vehicle Buddhi or the
Spiritual Soul.

has concreted the present physical body.

W H E E L S ” ) (a ) , THE SONS ARE TOLD TO CREATE
THEIR IMAGES. ONE THIRD REFUSE. TWO
(T H IR D S ) OBEY.
(a) At the middle of the Fourth Round
(the present one) the perfect equilibrium
between Spirit and Matter had to take place.
The Occult Commentary explains that one-third of
the Manasic entities “refuse to enter the chhayas
(shadows or images) of their inferiors. Thus had
selfish feeling prevailed from, the beginning, even
among the Gods, and they fell under the eye of the
Karmic Lipikas.” How they were punished will be
seen later. Since verse 4 long ages have passed.
§ 2. THE CURSE IS PRONOUNCED (a): THEY WILL
BE BORN IN THE FOURTH (R A C E ), SUFFER AND,
CAUSE SUFFERING. (b) THIS IS THE FIRST. WAR
(c).
The Fall of the Angels.
(a) Before the physiological “Fall”, propaga­
tion, whether human or animal, took place through
the w i l l of the Creators, or of their progeny. It was
67
the Fall of Spirit into generation, not the Fall of
mortal man.... To become the highest Dhyan Chohan
it is necessary for each Ego to attain to full self-con­
sciousness as a human, i.e., conscious Being, which
is synthesized for us in Man.
(6) “The curse is pronounced” does not mean,
in this instance, that any personal Being, God, or
superior Spirit, pronounced it, but simply that the
cause which could but create bad results had been
generated, and that the effects of a Karmic cause
could lead the “Beings” that counteracted the laws
of Nature, and thus impeded her legitimate progress,
only to bad incarnations, hence to suffering.
(c) “There were many wars” refers to several
struggles of adjustment, spiritual, cosmical, and as­
tronomical, but chiefly to the mystery of the evolu­
tion of man as he is now. Powers—pure Essences
—“that were told to create” is a sentence that relates
to a mystery explained elsewhere. It is not only one
of the most hidden secrets of Nature—that of genera­
tion, over whose solution the Embryologists have vain­
ly put their heads together—but likewise a divine
function which involves that other religious, or rather
dogmatic, mystery, the “Fall” of the Angels, as it is
called. i
Satan and his rebellious host would thus
prove, when the meaning of the allegory is
explained, to have refused to create physical man,
only to become the direct Saviours and the Creators
of “divine Man”....F or, instead of remaining a
mere blind functioning medium, impelled and guided
by fathomless Law, the rebellious Angel claimed and
enforced his right of independent judgment and will,
his right of free agency and responsibility, since man
and angel are alike under Karmic Law.
68

metheus at the end of Part II under “The ‘Curse’
from a Philosophical Point of View.”

. THE OLDER WHEELS ROTATED DOWNWARD AND

THE WHOLE (KOSMIOS). THERE WERE BATTLES
FOUGHT BETWEEN THE CREATORS AND THE
DESTROYERS, AND BATTLES FOUGHT FOR SPACE;
THE SEED APPEARING AND REAPPEARING CON­
TINUOUSLY (6).
(a ) The phrase “Older wheels” refers to the
worlds or Globes of our chain as they were during
the “previous Rounds.” The present Stanza, when
explained esoterically, is found embodied entirely in
the Kabalistic works.
(b) “Seed” stands for “World-Germ”, i.e.,
supersensuous matter existing in a state of primeval
differentiation. In theogony, every Seed is an
ethereal organism from which evolves later on a celes­
tial being, a God. This passage is purely astrono­
mical.
The reader is reminded that Kosmos often means
in our Stanzas only our own Solar System, not the
Infinite Universe.

(b) Information of great importance is given in
this comment by H.P.B. regarding the origin and
grades of the Initiates, two of "whom, known as M.
and K.H., collaborated with her in the writing of
this work. She says: There are four grades of
Initiation mentioned in exoteric works called in
Sanskrit, Srotapanna, Sagardagan, Anagamin, and
Arhan; the “four paths to Nirvana, in this, our Fourth
Bound, bearing the same appellations.... Three fur­
ther higher grades have to be conquered by the Arhan
who would reach the summit of the ladder of Arhat-
ship. There are those who have reached it even in
this Fifth Race of ours, but the faculties necessary
for the attainment of these higher .grades will be fully
developed in the average ascetic only at the end of
this Root Race, and in the Sixth and Seventh.
The Ancestors of the Arhats.
The “Sons of Wisdom” who incarnated in the
Third Race before it separated into sexes, produced
by Will (Kriyasakti) a progeny which was at first
a wondrous Being, called the “Initiator”, and after
him a group of semi-divine and semi-human beings.
“Set apart” in Archaic genesis for certain purposes,
they are those in whom are said to have incarnated
tha highest Dhyanis, “Munis and Rishis from previous
Mahvantaras”—to form the nursery for future human
adepts, on this Earth and during the present cycle.
These “Sons of Will and Yoga” born, so to speak, in
an immaculate way, remained, it is explained, entirely
apart from the rest of mankind. It is under the
direct, silent guidance of the “Initiator”, called the
“ G r e a t Sa c r if ic e ” , that all the other less divine
Teachers and instructors of mankind became, from
the first awakening of human consciousness, the guides
of early Humanity.
70
It is through these “Sons of God” that infant
humanity got its first notions of all the arts and
sciences, as well as of spiritual knowledge; and it is
they who have laid the first foundation-stone of those
ancient civilizations that puzzle so sorely our modern
generations of students and scholars.... Although the
descendants (spiritually of course) from the “Sons of
Will and Yoga” became in time divided into opposite
sexes, as their “Kriyasakti” progenitors did them­
selves, later on; yet even their degenerate descendants
have down to the present day retained a veneration
and respect for the creative function, and still regard
it in the light of a religious ceremony, whereas the
more civilised nations consider it as a mere animal
function. Compare the Western views and practice
in these matters with the Institutions of Manu in re­
gard to the laws of GrihasLa and married life [See
“Indian Marriage Laws” in the Appendix at end
of this book].
When, moved by the law of Evolution, the Lords
of Wisdom infused into man the spark of conscious­
ness, the first feeling it awoke to life and activity was
a sense cf solidarity, of one-ness with his spiritual
creators. As the child’s first feeling is for its mother
and nurse, so the first aspirations of the awakening
consciousness in primitive man were for those elements
he felt within himself, and who yet were outside and
independent of him.
D evotion arose out of that feeling, and became
the first and foremost motor in his nature; for it is
the only one which is natural in our heart. This feel­
ing of irrepressible, instinctive aspiration in primi­
tive man is beautifully, and one may say intuitionally,
described by Carlyle: “The great antique heart,”
he exclaims, “how like a child’s in its simplicity, like a
man’s in its earnest solemnity and depth; Heaven lies
71
over him wheresoever he goes or stands on the earth;
making all the earth a mystic temple to him, the
earth’s business all a kind of worship. .. .A great law
of duty, high as these two infinitudes (heaven and
hell), dwarfing all eke, annihilating all eke—it was
a reality, and it is one: the garment only of it is dead;
the essence of it lives through all times and all
eternity!”
It lives undeniably, and has settled in all its
ineradicable strength and power in the Asiatic Aryan
heart from the Third Race direct through its first
“Mind-born” Sons—the fruits of KriyasaJcti. As
time rolled on the holy caste of Initiates produced
but rarely, and from age to age, such perfect
creatures: beings apart, inwardly, though the same
as those who produced them outwardly.... There is
no nation in the world in which the feeling of devotion
or of religious mysticism is more developed and pro­
minent than in the Hindu people (I, 210). [See Pro­
fessor Dvivedi’s remarks under “Indian Marriage!
Laws” in the Appendix, where he says: “Philo­
sophy, as apart from religion is not known in India.
The ideal of religion is derived more from reason
than emotion. The very foundation of Indian
society is religion. And every institution, how­
ever insignificant, is conceived with a view, and
marked in a manner, to suppress individuality and
foster altruism.”]
The reason why Devotion is the special charac­
teristic of the original Aryans (the Hindus) is that,
as we learn from Stanza XTL v. 49, Part II, those
“Mind-born” Sons of the Third Race were “the Ser­
pents who re-descended; who made peace with the
Fifth (the Aryan Race) who taught and instructed
it”, after the destruction of the sin-laden Fourth
Race.

into seven (or 4 and 3) esoteric Orders within the
twelve great ones, recorded in the twelve signs of the
Zodiac; the seven of the manifesting scale being con­
nected, moreover, with the Seven Planets.... The
same hierarchy, with the same numbers, is found in
the Japanese system, in the “Beginnings” as taught
by both the Shinto and the Buddhist sects. In this
the Divine merges into the human, and creates
midway in its descent into matter the visible Uni­
verse.

(b) As in the Japanese system, in the
Egyptian, and every old cosmogony—at this divine
Flam e, the “One,” are lit the three descending
groups.
(c) The second order of Celestial Beings, those
of Fire and Ether (corresponding to Spirit and Soul,,
or the Atma-Buddhi) whose names are legion, are.
still formless, but more definitely “substantial”.
(d) The Third order corresponds to the Atma-
Buddhi-Manas: Spirit, Soul and Intellect [Mind],
and is called the “Triads.”
(e) The Fourth are substantial Entities. This
is the highest group among the Rapas (Atomic
Forms). It is the nursery of the human, conscious,
spiritual Souls.
(/) The Fifth group is a very mysterious one,
as it is connected with the Microcosmic Pentagon,
the five-pointed star representing man. In India
and Egypt these Dhyanis were connected with the
Crocodile, and their abode is in Capricornus.
(g) The Sixth and Seventh groups partake of
the lower qualities of the Quaternary. They are
conscious, ethereal Entities, as invisible as Ether,
and include numberless side groups, the lower of
which are the Nature-Spirits, or Elementals of
countless kinds and varieties. They are all subject to
Karma, and have to work it out through every cycle.
Being is an endless cycle within the One Absolute
Eternity, wherein move numberless inner cycles,
finite and conditioned.
(h) The seven creative Rishis now connected
with the constellation of the Great Bear.
2. THE ONE RAY MULTIPLIES THE SMALLER RAYS.
LIFE PRECEDES FORM, AND LIFE SURVIVES THE
LAST ATOM (OF FORM, STHULA-SARIRA, EX-
74
TERNAL BODY). THROUGH THE COUNTLESS
RAYS THE LIFE-RAY, THE ONE, LIKE A THREAD
THROUGH MANY BEADS (PEARLS) (a).
(a) The Vedantic conception of the Sutratma,
or life-thread, running through successive genera­
tions.
Embryology and the Ancestral Cell.
The two chief difficulties of the science of Em­
bryology—namely, (1) what are the forces at work
in the formation of the foetus, and (2) the cause of
“hereditary transmission” of likeness, physical, moral
or mental—have never been properly answered; nor
will they ever be solved still the day when scientists
condescend to accept Occult theories.
The German Embryologist-Philosopher Weiss-
mann—at one time a fervent Darwinist—shows one
infinitesimal cell, out of millions of others at work in
the formation of an organism, determining alone and
unaided, by means of constant segmentation and mul­
tiplication, the correct image of the future man
(or animal) in its physical, mental, and psychic
characteristics. He thus steps over the heads of the
Greek Hippocrates and Aristotle, right back into the
teachings of the old Aryans. It is that cell which im­
presses on the face and form of the new individual
the features of the parents or of some distant ancestor.
It is that cell, again, which transmits to him the in­
tellectual and mental idiosyncracies of his sires, and
so on. This plasm is the immortal portion of our
bodies—simply through the process of progressive
assimilations. Darwin’s theory, viewing the embryo-
logical cell as an essence or the extract from all other
cells, is set aside; it is incapable of accounting for
hereditary transmission.
There are but two ways of explaining the mystery
of heredity; either the substance of the germinal cell
75
is endowed with the faculty of crossing the whole
cycle of transformations that lead to the construction
of a separate organism and then to the reproduction
of identical germinal cells; or those germinal cells
do not have their genesis at all in the body of the
individual, but proceed directly from the ancestral
germinal cell passed from father to son through long
generations.
It is the latter hypothesis that Weissmann
accepted and has worked upon; and it is to this cell
that he traces the immortal part of man. So far, so
good; and when this almost correct theory is accepted,
how will Biologists explain the first appearance of
this everlasting cell?
It comes, then, to this in the esoteric teaching:
Mankind in its first prototypal, shadowy form, is the
oifspring of the Elohim of Life (or the Pitris) ; in
its qualitative and physical aspect it is the direct
progeny of of the “Ancestors,” the lowest Dhyanis,
or Spirits of the Earth. For its moral, psychic and
spiritual nature, it is indebted to a group of Divine
Beings, the name and characteristics of which will be
found in Part II, Stanza VII.
Biology and the Vital Principle.
Occultism teaches that (a) The life-atoms of our
life-principle {Prana) are never entirely lost when a
man dies. That the atoms best impregnated with the
life-principle (an independent, eternal, conscious
factor) are partially transmitted from father to son
by heredity, and partially are drawn once more toge­
ther and become the anima-.ing principle of the new
body in every new incarnation of the Monads. Be­
cause (!
b), as the individual Soul is ever the same, so
are the atoms of the lower principles (the physical
body, its astral or life double, etc.) drawn as they are
76
by affinity and Karmic law always to the same
individuality in a series of various bodies, etc. The
collective aggregation of these atoms forms thus the
Anima Mundi of our Solar System, the Soul of our
Universe, each atom of which is of course a soul, a
monad, a little universe endowed with consciousness,
hence with memory.—II, 671.
“What is Life?” was the subject of a debate at a
meeting of the British Association in South Africa,
in the autumn of 1929, when the following significant
views were expressed:
“We are groping in darkness after new ap­
proaches to the science of Biology. For the old
approaches are leading us astray, or at least no far­
ther on.
“The failure of ‘mechanism’ to explain conscious­
ness, instinct, emotion, and so on, seems to leave a
gap to be filled. It is filled by a mystic something-or-
other, by the ‘Vital Principle’ which, so to speak,
runs the machine.
“Evolution is a postulate we are bound to accept,
for without it the immense diversity we find in living
organisms would be a chaos—and a chaos it certainly
is not, for amongst the different kinds of creatures
that make up this diversity there is kinship, and
where there is kinship there is common descent.
Descent and change make evolution; but what causes
evolution we do not know.
“Biologists are in a crisis from which as yet no
way out is visible. They have suffered too much from
human self-centredness. Animals live lives of their
own in worlds of their own that are quite different
from our lives and our world. We are prone to
colour our contemplation of the animal world by our
own prevalent ideas, particularly the idea of progress.
77
IBut progress is a purely subjective, not an objective
reality.”
The ancients knew, far better than the moderns,
the real occult influences of the lunar body upon the
mysteries of conception. For it is the Moon and her
conjunctions that regulate conceptions, and every as-
trologet in India knows it. During the previous
Face and the beginning of this one, those who in­
dulged in marital relations during certain lunar
phases that made those relations sterile, were re­
garded as sorcerers and sinners. But even those sins
-of old, based on the Occult knowledge and the abuse
of it, would appear preferable to the crimes of to-day,
which are perpetrated because of the complete ignor­
ance of, and disbelief in all such occult influence.—I,
'228 n. See also v. 5 (d).
[By “the crimes of to-day” H.P.B. means those
■
‘contraconceptive’* practices now so widely promul­
gated under the title of Birth-Control. The matter
is dealt with fully later on in its proper place, in rela­
tion to the sins which were committed after the
■separation into sexes. Sse Stanza XII, “The ‘Curse’
from a Philosophical Point of View.”]
Behind the veil of Cosmic and Astrological sym­
bols there were the Occult mysteries of Anthropo­
graphy and the primeval genesis of man. . . . That
psychic and spiritual element belonged to MYSTERY
and in it ia t io n . There were things never recorded
in scrolls, but, as in Central Asia, on rocks and in
subterranean crypts.—229.
*1 have here included the term “contraception” because I
found that Hindu readers of Buddhism The Science of Life
iiad misunderstood the term “Birth Control”, which I refer
"to there at p. 148, 2nd. ed., thinking it meant Self-control in
the sense of the chastity and continence enjoined by their re­
ligion. See Appendix, under “Ancient Indian Marriage Laws.”

3. WHEN THE ONE BECOMES TWO, THE “THREE­
FOLD" APPEARS (a). THE THREE ARE (LINKED
INTO) ONE; AND IT IS OUR THREAD, O LANOO,
THE HEART OF THE MAN-PLANT, CALLED SAP-
TAPARNA (b).
(a) When the One Eternal drops its reflection
into the region of Manifestation, that reflection, “the
Ray,” differentiates the “Water of Space” ; or, in the
words of the “Book of the Dead”, “Chaos ceases
through the effulgence of the Ray of Primordial light
dissipating total darkness by the help of the great,
magic power of the W ord of the (Central) Sun.”'
Chaos becomes male-female, and Water, incubated
through Light, the “three-fold being issues as its
First-born.”
(b) Snptaparna is the seven-leaved plant so
sacred among the Buddhists because it symbolises the
seven principles of Man. [It was in the Saplaparna
(seven-chambered) Cave that the Lord Buddha used
to meditate and impart the Esoteric Doctrine to his
Arhats.]
4. IT IS THE ROOT THAT NEVER DIES, THE THREE-
TONGUED FLAME OF THE FOUR WICKS ( a ) ....
THE WICKS ARE THE SPARKS, THAT DRAW FROM
THE THREE-TONGUED FLAME (THEIR UPPER
TRIAD) SHOT OUT BY THE SEVEN, THEIR FLAME; i
THE BEAMS AND SPARKS OF ONE MOON RE­
FLECTED IN THE RUNNING WAVES OF ALL THE
RIVERS OF THE EARTH (“BHUMI,” OR
“PRITHIVI”) (6).
(a) The “Three-tongued flame” that never dies
is the immortal spiritual triad Atma-Buddhi-Manas,
the fruition of the last assimilated by the first two
after every terrestrial life. The “four wicks” that
are extinguished, are the four lower principles, in­
cluding the body. The four wicks and the three-
tongued flame correspond to the four unities and the
79
three Binaries of the Sephirothal tree (see Commen­
tary on Stanza VI).
(6) Just as milliards of bright sparks dance
on the waters of an ocean above which one and the
same moon is shining, so our evanescent personalities
—the illusive envelopes of the immortal monad-ego—
twinkle and dance on the waves of Maya. Bhumi
and Prithivi are Sanskrit translations: for the
original terms, unknown and unheard of in the West,
would only puzzle the reader more, and serve no
useful purpose.
Evolution fof Man the Thinker.
5. THE SPARK HANGS FROM THE FLAME BY THE
FINEST THREAD OF FOHAT. IT JOURNEYS
THROUGH THE SEVEN WORLDS OF MAYA (a).
IT STOPS IN THE FIRST (KINGDOM), AND IS A
METAL AND A STONE; IT PASSES INTO THE
SECOND. (KINGDOM), AND BEHOLD—A PLANT;
THE PLANT WHIRLS THROUGH SEVEN FORMS
AND BECOMES A SACRED ANIMAL; (THE FIRST
SHADOW OF THE PHYSICAL MAN) (6).
FROM THE COMBINED ATTRIBUTES OF THESE,
MANU (MAN), THE THINKER, IS FORMED.
WHO FORMS HIM? THE SEVEN LIVES; AND
THE ONE LIFE (c). WHO COMPLETES HIM? THE
FIVEFOLD LHA. AND WHO PERFECTS THE LAST
BODY? FISH, SIN, AND SOMA (THE MOON) (d).
(a) The phrase “through the Seven Worlds of
Maya” refers here to the Seven Globes of the Plane­
tary Chain and the Seven Rounds, or the 49 stations
of active existence that are before the “Spark” or
Monad, at the beginning of every “Great Life-Cycle” or
Manvantara. The “thread of Fohat” is the Thread
of Life (Sutratma) mentioned in verses 2, 3.
80
(b) The well-known Kabalistic aphorism
runs:—“A stone becomes a plant; the plant, a beast;
the beast, a man; the man a spirit; and the spirit a
god.” The “spark” animates all the kingdoms in turn
before it enters into and informs divine man, between
whom and his predecessor, animal man, there is all
the difference in the world.
It is only when, from a potential androgyne, man
has become separated into male and female, that he
will be endowed with the conscious, rational, in­
dividual Soul {Manas) “the principle or intelligence
of the Elohim,” to receive which he has to eat of the
fruit of Knowledge from the Tree of Good and Evil.
(c) The Occult doctrine says:—The same in­
finitesimal invisible lives compose the atoms of the
bodies of the mountain and the daisy, of man and the
ant, of the elephant, and of the tree that shelters him
from the sun. Each particle—whether you call it
organic or inorganic— is a life. Every atom and
molecule in the Universe is both life-giving and death­
giving to that form, inasmuch as it builds by aggre­
gation universes and the ephemeral vehicles ready to
receive the transmigrating soul, and as eternally des­
troys and changes the forms and expels those souls
from' their temporary abodes.—261.
(d) “Fish, Sin and Moon” make conjointly the
three symbols of the immortal Being.... While the
Moon-goddesses were connected in every mythology,
especially the Grecian, with child-birth, because of
the lunar influence on women and conception, the
occult and actual connection of the Moon with fecunda­
tion is to this day unknown to physiology, which re­
gards every popular practice in this respect as gross
superstition.
6. FROM THE FIRST-BORN (PRIMITIVE, OR THE
FIRST MAN) THE THREAD BETWEEN THE SILENT
81
WATCHER AND HIS ■SHADOW BECOMES MORE
STRONG AND RADIANT WITH EVERY CHANGE
(RE-INCARNATION) (a). THE MORNING SUN­
LIGHT HAS CHANGED INTO NOON-DAY GLORY... .
(a) The “Watcher,” or the divine prototype,
is at the upper most rung of the ladder of being; the
“shadow” at the lowest. Withal, the Monad of every
living being, unless his moral turpitude breaks the
connection and runs loose and “astray into the lunar
path”—to use the Occult expression—is an individual
Dhyan Choha-n, distinct from others, a kind of
spiritual individuality of its own, during one special
Manvantara.
7. THIS IS THY PRESENT WHEEL—SAID THE FLAME
TO THE SPARK. THOU ART MYSELF, MY IMAGE
AND MY SHADOW. I HAVE CLOTHED MYSELF IN
THEE, AND THOU ART MY VAHAN (VEHICLE)
TO THE DAY, “BE WITH US,” WHEN THOU SHALT
RE-BECOME MYSELF AND OTHERS, THYSELF
AND ME (a), THEN THE BUILDERS, HAVING
DONNED THEIR FIRST CLOTHING, DESCEND ON
RADIANT EARTH, AND REIGN OVER MEN—-WHO
ARE THEMSELVES (b).
(a) The day when “the spark will re-become
the Flange (man will merge into his Dhyan-Chohan)
myself and others, thyself and me”, as the Stanza has
it—means this: In Paranirvdna—when Pralaya will
have reduced not only material and psychical bodies,
but even the spiritual Ego (s) to their original prin­
ciple—the Past, Present, and even Future Humani­
ties, like all things, will be one and the same. Every­
thing will have re-entered the Great Breath. In other
words, everything will be “merged in Brahma” or
the Divine Unity.
(b) The Secret Doctrine teaches that the
Dhyani-Buddhas of the two higher groups, namely,
the “Watchers” or the “Architects,” furnished the
many and various races with divine kings and leaders.
It is the latter who taught humanity their arts and
sciences and the former who revealed to the incarnated
Monads that had just shaken off their vehicles of the
lower Kingdoms—and who had, therefore, lost every
recollection of their divine origin—the great spiritual
truths of the transcendental worlds.... The next
great Manvwitai'a will witness the men of our own
life-cycle becoming the instructors and guides of a
mankind whose Monads may now yet be imprisoned
—semi-conscious—in the most intellectual of the
animal kingdom, while their lower principles will be
animating, perhaps, the highest specimens of the
Vegetable world.—267.

BEGINNINGS OF SENTIENT LIFE

1. t h e LHA (a) WHICH TURNS THE FOURTH
(G L O B E , O R O U R E A R T H ) IS SERVANT TO THE
LHA (S) OF THE SEVEN (T H E P L A N E T A R Y S P IR ­
IT S ) (6 ), THEY WHO REVOLVE, DRIVING THEIR
CHARIOTS AROUND THEIR LORD, THE ONE EYE
(T IB . L O K A -U H A K S H U B ) OF OUR WORLD. HIS
BREATH GIVES LIFE TO THE SEVEN (G IV E S
L IG H T TO T H E P L A N E T S ) IT GAVE LIFE TO THE
FIRST (c). “THEY ARE ALL DRAGONS OF WIS­
DOM," adds the commentary (d).
(а) Lha is the ancient (Tibetan) word in
Trans-Himalayan regions for “Spirit” (any celestial
or superhuman Being) and it covers the whole series
of heavenly hierarchies, from Archangel or Dhyani
down to an angel of darkness or terrestrial Spirit.
(б) This expression shows in plain language
that the Spirit-Guardian of our globe (the 4th in
the Chain) is subordinate to the chief Spirit (or
God) of the Seven Planetary Genii or Spirits.
“The seven higher make the Seven Lhas create
the world”, states a Commentary; which means that
our Earth, leaving aside the rest, was created or
fashioned by terrestrial spirits, the “Regents” being
simply the supervisors. This is the first germ, the
seed of that which grew later into the Tree of
Astrology and Astrolatry. The Higher ones were;
the Gosmocratores, the fabricators of our Solar
83
84
System. [Mithras Cosmocrator may be seen on the
iviithraic tablets in the Koman museums].
(c) “His breath gave life to the seven” refers
as much to the Sun, who gives life to the Planets,
as to the “High One”, the Spiritual Sun, who gives
life to the whole Kosmos. The astronomical and
astrological keys opening the gate leading to the
mysteries of Theogony can be found only in the
later glossaries which accompany the Stanzas....
Without the help of the later Commentaries, compiled
V
jy generations of Adepts, it would be impossible to
understand the meaning correctly.
(d) In China the men of Fold (the “Heaven­
ly Man”) are called the twelve Tien-Hoang, the
twelve hierarchies of Dliyanis or Angels, with human
Faces, and Dragon bodies; the dragon standing for
Divine Wisdom or Spirit. They create men by in­
carnating themselves in seven figures of clay—earth
and water—made in the shape of those Tien-Hoang
(cf. Symbols of the Bonzes). In the Secret Catechism
of the Druses of Syria [a mystic sect connected with
the Trans-Himalayan Initiates] men were created by
the “Sons of God” descending on Earth, where, after
culling seven Mandragoras,* they animated these
roots, which became forthwith men.
*l'he Mandragora is the mandrake of the Bible, of Rachel
and Leah, and was the magic plant par excellence. Shakespeare
speaks of shrieking
. . . . like mandrakes tom out of the earth
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad.
These roots, present little similitude to man when found in
Spain, Italy, Asia Minor or Syria. But on the Isle of Candia
(Crete), and in Karamania near the city of Adan, they have
a wonderfully human form, and are highly prized as amulets.
Ginseng is a similar root greatly valued in the Far East. The
true Panax (Gk. ‘all-healing’) Ginseng is cultivated on a
large scale in Korea, and also grows wild in Northern Korea
and Manchuria. The Chinese name (pr. like the English
words ‘Run-shun’) means ‘Man body’. The Japanese scientist
Saito has established the potency of its active principle, which
the influence of the constellation Orion is believed to increase.
See Appendix: “Ancient Medicine.”
85
“The Druses” (wrote H.P.B. in 1881) “are the
descendants of, and a mixture of, mystics of all
nations, mystics who, in the face of cruel and un­
relenting persecution by the orthodox Christian
Church and orthodox Islamism, have, ever since
the first centuries of the Mohammedan propaganda,
been gathered together, and who gradually made
a permanent settlement in the fastnesses of Syria
and Mount Lebanon, where they had from the first
found refuge. Since then they have preserved the
strictest silence upon their beliefs and truly occult
rites. Later on their warlike character, great
bravery and unity of purpose, which made their
foes, whether Mussulman or Christian, equally fear
them, helped them, toward forming an independent
community, or, as we may term it, an imperium in
imperio. They are the Sikhs of Asia Minor, and
their polity offers many points of similarity with
the late ‘commonwealth’ of the followers of Guru
Nanak, even extending to their mysticism and in­
domitable bravery. [Both have the duty of de­
fending the visible places of worship, hence the
fighting over the Sikh shrines by the Akhalis in 1921,
and the revolt by the Druses against the French
mandate in Syria in 1928,—B.C.]. But the two are
even more closely related to a third and far more
mysterious community of religionists, of which
nothing or next to nothing is known by outsiders:
we mean that Fraternity of Tibetan Lamaists known
as the Brotherhood of Khe-lang, who mix but little
with the rest. . . . No more than the Druses do the
Lamaists seek to make proselytes. Both have their
‘Schools of Magic’, those in Tibet being attached
to some Lha-lchang (lamaseries) and those among
the Druses in the closely guarded crypts of initiation,
no stranger being even allowed inside the buildings
86
[The Schools referred to are, of course, those of
the Reformed or Yellow Sect of Tsong-Kha-pa of
which the Tashi Lama is the Head, not the Tantrik
Black Magic institutions of the Unreformed Red
Sect.—B.C.]. As the Tibetan Hobilgans are the
incarnations of the Spirit of Buddha, so the Druse
Okhals are the incarnations of H’amsa. Every
seventh year the Ohkals travel through Bussora
and Persia into Tartary and Tibet to the very west
of China, and return at the expiration of the eleventh
year, bringing fresh orders from ‘El Hamma. ” (A
Modern Panarion, 375).
2. SAID THE EARTH, “LORD OF THE SHINING FACE
(T H E SUN) MY HOUSE IS EMPTY-----SEND THY
SONS TO PEOPLE THIS WHEEL (E A R T H ). THOU
HAST SENT THY SEVEN SONS TO THE LORD OF
WISDOM (a). SEVEN TIMES DOTH HE SEE THEE
NEARER TO HIMSELF; SEVEN TIMES MORE DOTH
HE FEEL THEE. THOU HAST FORBIDDEN THY
SERVANTS, THE SMALL RINGS, TO CATCH THY
LIGHT AND HEAT, THY GREAT BOUNTY TO IN­
TERCEPT ON ITS PASSAGE (b). SEND NOW THY
SERVANT THE SAME!" (c).
(a) The “Lord of Wisdom” is Mercury (Sk.
Budha, lit. “The Wise One”).
(b) The modern Commentary explains the
words as a reference to a wellknown astronomical
fact “that Mercury receives seven times more light
and heat from the Sun than the Earth, or even the
beautiful Venus, which receives but twice that
amount more than our insignificant globe....
Mercury is an astrological planet, still more occult
and mysterious than Venus. It is identical with the
Mazdean Mithra, the genius or god “established
between the Sun and the Moon, the perpetual com­
panion of the ‘Sun’ of Wisdom.”
To quote from a Commentary: “Every world lias
its parent star and sister planet. Thus Earth is the
87
adopted child and younger brother of Venus, but its
inhabitants are of their own kind.... All sentient
beings (full septenary men or higher beings) are
furnished, in their beginnings, ivith forms and or­
ganisms in full harmony with the nature and state
of the sphere they inhabit."
Astrology is to exact astronomy 1/hat psy­
chology is to exact physiology. In astrology and
psychology one has to step beyond the visible world
spirit (H.P.B. in Isis Unveiled, I, 259). In days of
old, Astronomy was synonymous with Astrology;
and the great Astrological Initiation took place in
Egypt at Thebes, where the priests perfected if they
did not wholly invent the science (Ibid. II, 365).
Unfortunately, the key to the final door of Astrology
or Astronomy is lost by the modern Astrologer, in
the West, at any rate, since the suppression of the
Mysteries.
(c) Number Seven, the fundamental figure
among all other figures in every national religious
system, from Cosmogony down to man, must have
its raison d’etre. It is found among the ancient
Americans as prominently as among the archaic
Aryans and Egyptians. The symbol of man is the
cube unfolded in the form of a cross: three crossways
(the female) and four vertically. And this is man,
the culmination of the deity on Earth, whose body is
the Cross of flesh, on, through, and in-which he is ever
crucifying and putting to death the divine Logos or
his H igher Self.
3. SAID THE “LORD OF THE SHINING FACE." “I
SHALL SEND THEE A FIRE WHEN THY WORK IS
COMMENCED. RAISE THY VOICE TO OTHER
LOKAS (REGIONS), APPLY TO THY FATHER THE
LORD OF THE LOTUS (KUMUDA-PATI) (a) FOR
HIS SONS.. ..THY PEOPLE SHALL BE UNDER
88
THE RULE OF THE FATHERS (PITRI-PATI). THY,
MEN SHALL BE MORTALS. THE MEN OF THE LORD
OF WISDOM (BUDHA, MERCURY) NOT THE SONS
OF SOMA (THE MOON) ARE IMMORTAL. CEASE
THYW COMPLAINTS (b). TRY SEVEN SKINS ARE
YETA T H #E E .. ..THOU ART READY. THY MEN ARE
NOT READY (c).
(a) Kumuda-Pati is the Moon, the Earth’s
parent, in his region of Soma-loka. Though the
Pitris (Pitar or “Fathers”) are sons of the Gods,
elsewhere sons of Brahma and even Rishis, they are
generally known as the “lunar” ancestors.
(b) The Moon being an inferior body to the
Earth even, to say nothing of other planets, the
terrestrial men produced by her sons—the lunar men
or “ancestors”—from her shell or body, cannot be
immortal. They cannot hope to become real, self-
conscious and intelligent m(en, unless they are finished,
so to- say, by other creators.
(c) Archaic scripture teaches that at the com­
mencement of every local Kalpa, or Round, the Earth
is re^born; “as the human Jiva (Monad), when
passing into a new womb, gets re-covered with a new
body, so does the Jiva of the Earth; it gets a more
perfect and solid covering with each Round, after
re-emerging once more from the matrix of space into
objectivity” (Commentary). This process is attended,
cf course, by the throes of the new birth or geological
convulsions. The only reference to it is the
following:
4. AND AFTER GREAT THROES SHE (THE EARTH)
CAST OFF HER OLD THREE AND PUT ON HER
NEW SEVEN SKINS, AND STOOD IN HER FIRST
ONE (a).
\ (a) The Earth is said to cast off her old three
skins, because this refers to the three preceding
Rounds she has already passed through; the present
89
being the Fourth Round out of the seven.... The
“Seven Skins”, in the first of which she now stands,
refer to the seven geological changes which accom­
pany and correspond to the evolution of the Seven
Root Races of Humanity.
The Secret Doctrine postulates three new pro­
positions, which stand in direct antagonism to
modern science as well as to current religious
dogmas:
(а) The simultaneous evolution of seven human
groups on seven different portions of our globe.
(б) The birth of the astral [ethereal] before
the physical body.
(c) That man, in this Round, preceded every
mamjmalian—the anthropoids included—in the
animal kingdom.
STANZA II.
NATURE UNAIDED FAILS.
(5) After enormous periods the Earth creates monsters. (6)
The “Creators” are displeased. (7) They dry the Earth. (8)
The forms are destroyed by them. (9) The first great tides.
(10) The beginning of incrustation.
5. THE WHEEL WHIRLED FOR THIRTY CRORES (OF
YEARS, OR 300,000,000*). IT CONSTRUCTED RUPAS
(FORMS). SOFT STONES, THAT HARDENED
(MINERALS) ; HARD PLANTS, THAT SOFTENED
(VEGETATION). VISIBLE FROM INVISIBLE, IN­
SECTS AND SMALL LIVES (SARISRIPA, SWA-
PADA). SHE (THE EARTH) SHOOK THEM OFF
HER BACK, WHENEVER THEY OVERRAN THE
MOTHER (a). AFTER THIRTY CRORES OF YEARS,
SHE TURNED ROUND. SHE LAY ON HER BACK;
ON HER SIDE... .SHE WOULD CALL NO SONS
OF HEAVEN, SHE WOULD ASK NO SONS OF
WISDOM. SHE CREATED FROM HER OWN BOSOM.
SHE EVOLVED WATER-MEN TERRIBLE AND BAD
( 6 ) .
(a) This relates to an inclination of the axis—
of which there were several—to a consequent deluge
and chaos on Earth (having, however, no reference
to primeval chaos), in which monsters, half-human,
half-animal, were generated.
(b) “The water-men terrible and bad” (who
were the production of physical nature alone, a re-
*Three Occult Ages. The Rig Veda has the same division.
In the “Physician’s Hymn,” (X, 97, 1) it is said that “the
plant's came into being three ages ( Triyugam) before the gods”
on our Earth. See Stanza III “Brahmin Chronology” and
Stanza XI, v. 44 (d) “Parallelism of Life”.
90
91
suit of the “evolutionary impulse” and the first at­
tempt to create man the “crown”, and the aim and
goal of all animal life on Earth) are shown to be
failures in our Stanzas.
6. THE WATER-MEN TERRIBLE AND BAD SHE HER­
SELF CREATED. FROM THE, REMAINS OF OTHERS
(FROM THE MINERAL, VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL
REMAINS) FROM THE FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD>
(ROUNDS) SHE FORMED THEM. THE DHYANI
CAME AND LOOKED... .THE DHYANI FROM THE
BRIGHT FATHER-MOTHER, FROM THE WHITE
(SOLAR-LUNAR) REGIONS THEY CAME (GODS AND
PLANETARY SPIRITS) FROM THE ABODES OF
THE IMMORTAL-MORTALS (a).
(a) Thus physical nature, when left to herself
in the creation of animal man, is shown to have
failed. She can produce the first two and the lower
animal kingdoms, but spiritual, independent and
intelligent powers are required for the creation of
Man, besides the “coats of skin” and the “Breath of
animal Life”. The human Monads of preceding
Rounds need something higher than purely physical
materials to build their personalities with, under the
penalty of remaining below even any “Frankenstein”
animal.
7. DISPLEASED THEY WERE. OUR FLESH IS NOT
..THERE (THEY SAID). THIS IS NO FIT RUPA FOR
OUR BROTHERS OF THE FIFTH. NO DWELLINGS
FOR THE LIVES. PURE WATERS, NOT TURBID,
THEY MUST DRINK (a). LET US DRY THEM (THE
WATERS).
The Esoteric Commentary says: “It is from the
material Worlds that descend they who fashion
physical man at the Manvantaras. They are inferior
Lha (Spirits) possessed of a dual body (an astral
within an ethereal form,). They are the fashioners
and creators of our body of illusion.” In the Vishnu
Parana we find Brahma assuming as the male God,
92
for purposes of creation, “four bodies invested by
three qualities.” In Esotericism this has a direct
bearing upon the Seven Principles of the manifested
Brahma, or Universe, in the same order as in Man.
Exoterically it is only four principles.. . . When
Brahma wants to create the world anew and construct
progeny through his Will. . . .he collects Yoga-like his
mind. This thinking of oneself as this, that, or the
other, is the chief factor in the production of every
kind of psychic or even physical phenomena. The
words “whosoever shall say to this mountain ‘be thou
removed and cast into the sea,’ and shall not doubt. . . .
that thing will come to pass,” are no vain words. Only
the word “faith” ought to be translated by Will.
Faith without Will is like a windmill without wind—
barren of results (58-9).
The “Lives” are the Monads of the presentments
of men of the Third (preceding) Kound (see v. 4,
sup.), the huge Ape-like forms.
8. THE FLAMES CAME. THE FIRES WITH THE
SPARKS; THE NIGHT FIRES AND DAY FIRES (a).
THEY DRIED OUT THE TURBID DARK WATERS.
WITH THEIR HEAT THEY QUENCHED THEM. THE
LHAS (SPIRITS) OF THE HIGH; THE LHAMAYIN
(THOSE) OF BELOW, CAME (b). THEY SLEW THE
FORMS, WHICH WERE TWO- AND FOUR-FACED.
THEY FOUGHT THE GOAT-MEN, AND THE DOG-
HEADED MEN, AND THE MEN WITH FISHES’
BODIES.
[Lhamayin. (Tib.) Lit. “Gods not are”. Ele­
mental Sprites, usually inimical to man.]
(a) The “Flames” are a Hierarchy of Spirits
parallel to, if not identical with, the “burning” fiery
Saraph (Seraphim) mentioned by Isaiah (vi. 2—6),
those who attend, according to Hebrew Theogony,
“the Throne of the Almighty.” Melba is the Lord
of the “Flames.” When he appears on Earth, he
9
3
assumes the personality of a Buddha, says a popular
legend. He is one of the most ancient and revered
Lhas, a Buddhist St. Michael.
(b) The word “Below” must not be taken to
mean infernal regions, but simply a spiritual, or
rather ethereal, Being” of a lower grade, because
nearer to the Earth, or one step higher than our
terrestrial sphere ; while the Lhas are Spirits of the
highest Spheres—whence the name of the capital
of Tibet, Lha-sa [Lit. “Gods’ Place”].
9. MOTHER-WATER, THE GREAT SEA WEPT. SHE
AROSE, SHE DISAPPEARED IN THE MOON, WHICH
HAD LIFTED HER, WHICH HAD GIVEN HER BIRTH
(a).
(a) Science believes that the Moon originally
was tidally elevated from the Earth, eventually be­
coming separated from it. The Occult teaching is
the reverse of this. The Moon is far older than
the Earth; and, as stated in Part I, it is the latter
which owes its being to the former, however
astronomy and geology may explain the fact. Hence,
the tides and the attraction to the Moon, as shown
by the liquid portion of the Globe ever striving to
raise itself towards its parent.
10. WHEN THEY (THE. RUPAS) WERE DESTROYED,
MOTHER-EARTH REMAINED BARE; SHE ASKED TO
BE DRIED (a).
(a) The time for its incrustation period had
arrived. The waters had separated and the process
was started. It was the beginning of a new life.
This is what one key divulges to us. Another key
teaches the origin of Water, its admixture with Fire
(liquid fire, it calls it), and enters upon an alchemical
description of the progeny of the two, i.e. solid matter
such as minerals and earths.
STANZA III.
ATTEMPTS TO CREATE MAN.
(11) The Descent of the Demiurge. (12) The lunar gods
ordered to create. (13) The higher gods refuse.
11. THE LORD OF THE LORDS CAME. FROM HER
(EARTH’S) BODY HE SEPARATED THE WATERS,
' AND THAT WAS HEAVEN ABOVE, THE FIRST
HEAVEN (THE ATMOSPHERE, OR THE AIR, THE
FIRMAMENT) (a).
(a) Here tradition falls again into the Uni­
versal. As in the earliest version, repeated in the
Puranas, so in the latest, the Mosaic account. In the
Elohistic “creation” (Genesis, verses 6, 7, 8, 9) “God”
creates a firmament in the midst of the waters....
and says “let dry land appear”. And now comes the
traditional peg whereupon is hung the esoteric portion
of the Kabalistic interpretation.
12 THE GREAT CHOHANS (LORDS), CALLED THE
LORDS OF THE MOON, OF THE AIR’Y BODIES (a).
“BRING FORTH MEN, (THEY WERE TOLD), MEN
OF YOUR NATURE. GIVE THEM (i. e., THE JIVAS
OR MONADS) THEIR FORMS WITHIN. SHE
(MOTHER EARTH OR NATURE) WILL BUILD
COVERINGS WITHOUT (EXTERNAL BODIES).
(FOR) MALES-FEMALES WILL THEY BE. LORDS
OF THE FLAME, ALSO.”
(a) Who are the Lords of the Moon? In India
they are called Pitris a/t-lunar ancestors”, but in
the Hebrew scrolls it is Jehovah himself who is the
“Lord of the Moon,” collectively as the Host, and
94
95
also as one of the Elohim. The astronomy of the
Hebrews and their observance of Times was regulated
by the moon.
Brahmin Chronology.
To the mind of the Eastern student of Oc­
cultism, two figures are indissolubly connected with
mystic astronomy, chronology, and their cycles. Two
grand and mysterious figures, towering like giants
in the Archaic Past, emerge before him, whenever
he has to refer, to Yugas (Ages) and Kalyas
(Cycles). When, at what period of pre-history they
lived, none save a few men in the world know, or
ever can know with that certainty which is required
by exact chronology. It may have been 100,000 years
ago, it may have been 1,000,000, for all that the
outside world will ever know. The mystic West and
Freemasonry talk loudly of Enoch and Hermes. The
mystic East speaks of N a r a d a the old Vedic Rishi,
and of A s u r a m a y a the Atlantean (4 7 ) ... . In the
old Stanzas Pesh-Hun (as Narada is called in Cis-
Himalayan Esotericism) is credited with having
calculated and recorded all the astronomical and
cosmic cycles to come, and with having taught the
Science to the first gazers at the starry vault. And
it is Asuramaya who is said to have based all his
astronomical works upon those records, to have
determined the duration of all the past geological
and cosmjcal periods, and the length of all the cycles
to come till the end of this life-cycle, or the end of
the Seventh Root Race [i.e. of the present Fourth
Round].
The chronological calculations given overleaf
are those of the Brahmins, but most of them are
also those of the Secret Doctrine [See Stanza XI, v.
44: Table, “Parallelism of Life]. The chronology
96
and computations of the Brahmin Initiates are based
upon the Zodiacal records of India and the works
of Asuramaya. The Atiantean Zodiacal records can­
not err, as they were compiled under the guidance
of Those who first taught astronomy, among other
things, to mankind [i.e. the Divine Instructors of
infant Humanity] .... Asuramaya, to whom epic
tradition points as the earliest astronomer in
Aryavarta. ... (£9) was a direct descendant of the
Wise Race, the Race that never dies (67).
The following are some of the lesser periods
given in the calendar referred to, calculated to the
year 1887, which are generally accepted throughout
India:

13. THEY (T H E M O O N -G O D S) WENT, EACH ON HIS
ALLOTTED LAND: SEVEN OF THEM, EACH ON
HIS LOT, THE LORDS OF THE FLAME REMAINED
BEHIND. THEY WOULD NOT GO, THEY WOULD
NOT CREATE (a).
(a) The Secret Teachings show the divine
Progenitors creating men on seven portions of the
globe, “each on his lot”, i.e., each a different race of
men externally and internally, and on different zones.
. . .Occultism divides the “Creators” into twelve clas­
ses; of which four have reached liberation to the end
of the “Great Age” ; the fifth is ready to reach it, but
still remains active on the intellectual planes; while
seven are still under direct Karmic law. These last
97
act on the man-bearing- g-lobes of our chain. The
Great Age is the Maha-Kalpa, a period of 311 billion
and 40,000 million of our years, or 100 “years” of
Brahma.
To complete the septenary man, to. add to his
three lower principles and cement them with the
spiritual Monad (which could never dwell in such a
form otherwise than in an absolutely latent state)
two connecting principles are needed: Manas and
Kama (79) . . . .Between man and the animal (whose
Monads or Jivas are fundamentally identical) there is
the impassable abyss of Mentality and Self-conscious­
ness. What is human Mind in its higher aspect?
Whence comes it, if it is not a portion of the essence
(and in some rare cases the very essence) of a higher
Being, one from a higher and divine plane? Can Man
—a gocl in the animal form—be the product of Material
Nature by evolution alone, even as is the animal,
which differs from Man in external shape Tut by no
means in the materials of its physical fabric, and is
informed by the same, though undeveloped, Monad—
seeing that the intellectual potentialities of the two
differ as the Sun does from the glowworm? And
what is it that creates such difference, unless Man is
an animal plus a living god within his physical
shell? (81). [Kama is Volition and Desire].

14. THE SEVEN HOSTS, THE “WILL-(OR M IN D -)
BORN” LORDS, PROPELLED BY THE SPIRIT OF
LIFE-GIVING (F O H A T ), SEPARATE MEN FROM
THEMSELVES, EACH ON HIS OWN ZONE (a).
(a) They threw off their “shadows” or astral
bodies—if such an ethereal being as a “Lunar Spirit”
may be supposed to possess an astral, besides a
hardly tangible body. In another Commentary it is
said that the “Ancestors” breathed out the first man,
as BroJima is explained to have breathed out the
Suras (Gods), when they became “Asuras” (from
Asu, breath).
Very soon the day will dawn when the world will
have to choose whether it will accept the miraculous
creation of man (and Kosmos too) out of nothing,
according to the dead letter of Genesis, or a first man
born from a fantastic link—absolutely “missing” so
far—the common ancestor of man and the “true
ape.” Between these two fallacies Occult philosophy
steps in. It teaches that the first human stock was
projected by higher and semi-divine Beings out of
their own essences.... that man was not “created”
the complete being he is now, however imperfect he
still remains. There was a spiritual, a psychic, an
99
intellectual, and an animal evolution, from the
highest to the lowest, as well as a physical develop­
ment from the simple and homogeneous up to the
more complex and heterogeneous, though not quite
on the lines traced for us by the modern evolution­
ists. This double evolution in two contrary directions
required various ages, of divers natures and degrees
of spirituality and intellectuality, to fabricate the
being now known as man.
15. SEVEN TIMES SEVEN SHADOWS (C H H A Y A S ) OR
FUTURE MEN (O R A M A N A S A S ) (a) WERE (T H U S )
BORN, EACH OF HIS OWN COLOUR (C O M ­
P L E X IO N ) AND KIND ( 6 ) . EACH (A L S O ) INFERIOR
TO HIS FATHER (C R E A T O R ). THE FATHERS, THE
BONELESS, COULD GIVE NO LIFE TO BEINGS
WITH BONES. THEIR PROGENY WERE BHUTA
(P H A N T O M S ) WITH NEITHER FORM NOR MIND,
THEREFORE THEY WERE CALLED THE CHHAYA
(IM A G E O R S H A D O W ) RACE (c).
(a) Airmnasa means “without Mind” [Manas,
the thinking fifth principle]. “The subtle bodies re­
main without understanding {Manas) until the advent
of the Suras (Gods) now called Asuras (not Gods)”,
says the Commentary.
Each class of Creators endows man with what
he has to give: the one builds his external form, the
other gives him its essence which later on becomes
the fluman Higher Self, owing to the personal
exertion of the individual. But they could not make
men as they were themselves—perfect, because
sinless: sinless because of having only the first pale
shadowy outlines of attributes, and these all perfect
from the human standpoint—white, pure and cold as
the virgin snow. Where there is no struggle, there
is no merit.
(b) These “shadows” were born “each of his
own colour and kind”, each also “inferior to his
100
creator”, because the latter was a complete being of
his kind. The Commentaries refer the first sentence
to the colour or complexion of each human race thus
evolved.
The creating powers produce Man, but fail in
their final object. All these Logoi strive to endow
Man with conscious immortal spirit, reflected in the
mind {Manas) alone. They fail, and they are all re­
presented as being punished for the failure, if not for
the attempt. What is the nature of the punishment ?
A sentence of imprisonment in the lower or nether
region, which is our earth, the lowest in its chain:
an eternity—meaning the duration of the life-cycle—
in the darkness of matter, or within animal Man.
(c) Chhaya, as already explained, is the astral
image. It bears this meaning in Sanskrit works.
Thus Sanjna (Spiritual Consciousness), the wife of
Surya, the Sun, is shown retiring into the jungle to
lead an ascetic life, and leaving behind to her hus­
band her Chhaya, shadow or image. [Rider Haggard’s
story, Morning Star, is based on a similar use
of the Ka, or double, taking the place of its owner].
16. HOW ARE THE (REAL) MANUSHYAS BORN? THE
MANUS WITH MINDS, HOW ARE THEY MADE? (a)
THE FATHERS (BARHISHAD) CALL TO THEIR
HELP THEIR OWN FIRE (THE KAVYAVAHANA,
ELECTRIC FIRE), WHICH IS THE FIRE THAT
BURNS IN EARTH. THE SPIRIT OF THE EARTH
CALLED TO HIS HELP THE SOLAR FIRE (SUCHI,
THE SPIRIT IN THE SUN). THESE THREE (THE
PITR1IS AND THE TWO FIRES) PRODUCED IN
THEIR JOINT EFFORTS A GOOD RUPA. IT (THE
FORM) COULD STAND, WALK, RUN, RECLINE AND
FLY. YET IT WAS STILL BUT A CHHAYA, A
SHADOW WITH NO SENSE (b )..................
(a) It is the four orders or classes of Dhyan-
Chohans out of the seven, says the Commentary, “who
101
were the progenitors of the concealed man”, i.e., the
subtle inner man. The “Lha” of the Moon, the lunar
spirits, were, as already stated, only the ancestors of
his form, i.e., of the model according to which Nature
began her external work upon him.
(b) Thus, primitive man was, when he appear­
ed, only a senseless Bhuta or phantom. This attempt
was a failure. It allegorizes the vanity of physical
nature’s attempts to construct even a perfect animal
—let alone man. For the “Fathers”, the lower
Angels, are all Nature-Spirits, and the higher Ele­
mental also possess an intelligence of their own; but
this is not enough to construct a t h in k in g man.
“Living Fire” was needed, that Fire which gives
the human mind its self-perception and self-conscious­
ness or Manas. This Stanza explains the mystery of,
and fills the gap between, the informing principle
in man—the higher self or human Monad—and the
animal Monad, both one and the same, although the
former is endowed with divine intelligence, the latter
with instinctual faculty alone. How is the difference
to be explained, and the presence of that higher SELF
in man accounted for? The Commentary says:
“The Sons of m ah at are the quickeners of the
human Plant. They are the Waters falling upon the
arid soil of latent life, and the Spark that vivifies the
human animal. They are the Lords of Spiritual Life
eternal ..In the beginning (in the Second Race)
some (of the Lords) only breathed their essence into
Manushya (men), and some took up in man their
abode."
This shows that not all men become incarnations
of the “divine Rebels,” but only a few among them.
The remainder had their fifth principle simply
quickened by the spark thrown into it, which accounts
102
for the great differences in the intellectual capacities
of men and races.
17. THE BREATH (H U M A N M O N A D ) NEEDED A FORM;
THE FATHERS GAVE IT. THE BREATH NEEDED
A GROSS BODY; THE EARTH MOULDED IT. THE
BREATH NEEDED THE . SPIRIT OF LIFE; THE
SOLAR LHAS BREATHED IT INTO ITS FORM. THE
BREATH NEEDED A MIRROR OF ITS BODY
(A S T R A L S H A D O W S ); “WE GAVE IT OUR OWN,”
SAID THE DHYANIS. THE BREATH NEEDED A
VEHICLE OF DESIRES (K A M A R U P A ) ; “IT HAS
IT,” SAID THE DRAINER OF WATERS (S U C H I, T H E
F IR E O F P A S S IO N A N D A N IM A L IN S T IN C T ). THE
BREATH NEEDS A MIND TO EMBRACE THE
UNIVERSE; “WE CANNOT GIVE THAT," SAID THE
FATHERS. “I NEVER HAD IT," SAID THE SPIRIT
OF THE EARTH. “THE FORM WOULD BE CON­
SUMED WERE I TO GIVE IT MINE,” SAID THE
GREAT (S O L A R ) FIRE___ (N A S C E N T ) MAN RE­
MAINED AN EMPTY, SENSELESS BHUTA . . . . THUS
HAVE THE BONELESS GIVEN LIFE TO THOSE
WHO BECAME (L A T E R ) MEN WITH BONES IN
THE THIRD (R A C E ) (a).
(a) The “Father” of primitive physical man,
or of his body, is the vital electric principle residing
in the Sun. The Moon is its Mother, because of that
mysterious power in the Moon which has as decided
an influence on gestation and generation, which it re­
gulates, as it has on the growth of plants and animals
(See ante Part I, Stanza VII, v. 2).
The “Wind” or Ether, standing in this case for
the agent of transmission by which those influences
are carried down from the two luminaries and diffused
upon Earth, is referred to as the “nurse;” while
“Spiritual Fire” alone makes of man a divine and
perfect entity.
Now what is that “Spiritual Fire”? In Alchemy
it is HYE'ROGEN, in general; while in esoteric actuality
103
it is the emanation or the Ray which proceeds from
its noumenon, the “Dhyan of the first Element.”
Hydrogen is gas only on our terrestrial plane....
It is the father and generator, so to say, or rather the
Upadhi (basis) of both air and w ater, and is “fire,
and water,” in fact: one under three aspects; hence
the chemical and alchemical trinity.... The Alche-
mits very correctly connect Fire with every element,
as do the Occultists. See also v. 18 (c).
The following order on parallel lines may be
found in the evolution of the elements and the Senses,
or in Cosmic terrestrial “man” or “Spirit,” and mortal
physical man:—
1. Ether . Hearing . . Sound.
2. Air . . Touch....... Sound and Touch.
3. Fire Sight....... Sound, Touch and
or Light Colour.
4. Water. .Taste .... Sound, Touch, Colour
and Taste.
5. Earth.. Smell....... Sound, Touch, Colour,
Taste and Smell.
As seen, each Element adds to its own charac-
teristics those of its predecessor; as each Root Race
adds the characterizing sense of the preceding Race.
The same is true in the septenary Creation of man,
who evolves gradually in seven stages, and on the same
principles.
STANZA V.
THE EVOLUTION OF THE SECOND RACE.
(18) The Sons of Yoga. (19) The Sexless Second Race.
(20) The Sons of the Sons of Twilight. (21) The “Shadow,”
or the Astral Man, retires within and man developes a physical
body.
18. THE FIRST (RACE) WERE THE SONS OF YOGA.
THEIR SONS, THE CHILDREN OF THE YELLOW
FATHER AND THE WHITE MOTHER.
In the later Commentary, the sentence is
translated:—
“The Sons of the Sun and of the Moon, the nurs­
ling of ether (or the wind)......... (a).
“They were the shadoivs of the shadows of the
Lords (5). They (the shadows) expanded. The Spir­
its of the Earth clothed them; the Solar Lhas warmed
them (i. e. preserved the vital fire in the nascent physi­
cal forms). The Breaths had life, hut had no under­
standing. They had no fire nor water of their own (c).
(a) Remember in this connection the Tabula
Smaragdina of Hermes, the Esoteric meaning of
which has Seven Keys to it. The Astro-Chemical is
well known to students, the Anthropological may be
given now. The “One Thing” mentioned in it is Ma n .
It is said: “The Father of T hat one only t h in g
is the Sun; its Mother the Moon; the Wind carries
it in his bosom, and its nurse is the Spirituous Earth.”
104
105
In the occult rendering of the same it is added: “and
Spiritual Fire is its instructor (Guru).”
This Fire is the Higher Self, the Spiritual Ego,
that which is eternally re-incarnating under the in­
fluence of its lower personal Selves, changing with
every re-birth, full of Tanha or ‘desire to live.’ It is
a strange law of Nature that, on this plane, the higher
(Spiritual) Nature should be, so to say, in bondage
to the lower. Unless the Ego takes refuge in the
Atman, the ALL-SPIRIT, and merges entirely into
the Essence thereof the personal Ego may goad it to
the bitter end.*
In short, Spirituality is on its ascending arc, and
the animal or physical impedes it from steadily pro­
gressing on the path of its evolution only when the
selfishness of the personality has so strongly infected
the real inner man with its lethal virus that the up­
ward attraction has lost all its power on the thinking
reasonable man. In sober truth, vice and wickedness
are an abnormal, unnatural manifestation at this
period of our human evolution—at least they ought to
be so. The fact that mankind was never more selfish
and vicious than it is now (civilised nations having
succeeded in making of the first an ethical charac­
teristic, of the second an art) is an additional proof
of the exceptional nature of the phenomenon (110).
This cannot be thoroughly understood unless the
student makes himself familiar with the Mystery of
*This is the object of the training in Raja Yoga and the
Dhyana (Meditation) Schools of Asiatic Mahayana Buddhism,
as set forth in the Tibetan Golden Precepts, translated by
“H.P.B.” (The Voice of the Silence, Peking Edition, 1928).
In the Tibetan text the “Sons of Yoga” (early Third Race in­
carnations) are called “Sons of Dhyana,” or of that abstract
meditation through which the Dhydni-Buddhas create their
celestial sons the Dhyani-Bodhisativas (II, 116).

Evolution, which proceeds on triple lines—Spiritual,
Psychic (i.e. Manasic or Mental), and Physical. See
end of Part I, “Summary of the Principles.”
(b) That is, the progenitors created man out of
their own astral bodies. This explains a universal
belief. The Devas are credited in the East with hav­
ing no shadows of their own. “The Devas cast no
shadows,” and this is the sure sign of a good holy
Spirit.
Why had they “no fire or water of their own”?
Because:—
(c) That which Hydrogen is to the elements and
gases on the objective plane, its noumenon is in the
world of mental or subjective phenomena; since its
trinitarian latent nature is mirrored in its three ac­
tive emanations from the three higher principles in
man, namely, “Spirit, Sold, and Mind,” or Atma,
Buddhi, and Manas. It is the spiritual and also the
material human basis.
Rudimentary man, having been nursed by the
“air” or the “wind,” becomes the perfect man later
on; when, with the development of “Spiritual Fire,”
the noumenon of the “Three in One” within his Self,
he acquires from his inner Self, or Instructor, the
Wisdom of Self-Consciousness, which he does not
possess in the beginning. Thus here again, divine
Spirit is symbolised by the Sun or Fire; divine Soul
by Water and the Moon, both standing for the Father
and Mother of Pneuma, human Soul, or Mind,
symbolised by the Wind or air, for Pneuma means
“breath.”
The Mystery of the Sin-Bearing Christos.
Higher and Lower Manas are one—and yet they
are not—and that is the great mystery, The Higher
107
Manas or E go is essentially divine and therefore
pure; no stain can pollute it, as no punishment can
reach it, per se, the more so since it is innocent of,
and takes no part in, the deliberate transactions of
its Lower Ego. Yet, by the very fact that, though
dual, and during life the Higher is distinct from the
Lower, “the Father and Son” are one; and because
that, in reuniting with the parent Ego, the Lower
Soul fastens upon and impresses upon it all its bad
as well as good actions, both have to suffer: the
Higher Ego, though innocent and without blemish,
has to bear the punishment of the misdeeds committed
by the lower Self together with it in their future in­
carnation. The whole doctrine of the Atonement is
built upon this old esoteric tenet; for the Higher Ego
is the antitype of that which is on this earth the
type, namely, the personality.
The Secret Doctrine shows that the Mdnasa-
Putras, or incarnating E gos, have taken upon them­
selves, voluntarily and knowingly, the burden of all
the future sins of their future personalities. Hence it
is easy to see that it is neither Mr. A. nor Mr. B. nor
any of the personalities that periodically clothe the
Self-Sacrificing E go, which are the real Sufferers, but
verily the innocent Christos within us.
Hence the mystic Hindus say that the Eternal
Self, or the Ego (the one in three and three in one),
is the “Charioteer” or driver; the personalities are
the temporary and evanescent passengers; while the
horses are the animal passions of man, (See Bhagavat
Gita). It is, then, true to say that when we remain
deaf to the Voice of Conscience, we crucify the
Christos within us.—H. P. Blavatsky on Dreams.

19. THE SECOND RACE (WAS) THE PRODUCT BY
BUDDING AND EXPANSION; THE A-SEXUAL
108
FORM) FROM THE SEXLESS (SHADOW). THUS
WAS, O LANOO, THE SECOND RACE PRODUCED
(a).
(a) If the cell theory applies equally to Botany
and Zoology, and extends to Morphology, as well as
to the Physiology of organisms, and, if the microscopic
cells are looked upon by physical science as independ­
ent living beings—just as Occultism regards the “fiery
lives”*—there is no difficulty in the conception of the
primitive process of procreation.
The astral form clothing the Monad was sur­
rounded, as it still is, by its egg-shaped sphere of
■aura, which here corresponds to the substance of the
germ-cell or ovum. The astral form itself is the nu­
cleus, now, as then, instinct with the principle of life.
When the season of reproduction arrives, the
swb-astral “extrudes” a miniature of itself from the
egg of surrounding aura. This germ grows and feeds
on the aura till it becomes fully developed, when it
gradually separates from its parent, carrying with
it its own sphere of aura; just as we see living cells
reproducing their like by growth and subsequent
division into two.
“The early Second (Root) Race were the Fathers
of the ‘Sweat-born’; the later Second (Root) Race
were ‘Sweat-born’ themselves.’’
This passage from the Commentary refers to the
work of evolution from the beginning of a Race to its
close. The “Sons of Yoga,” or the primitive astral
race, had seven stages of evolution racially, or col­
lectively, as every individual Being in it had, and has
now. It is not Shakespeare only who divided the ages
of man into a series of seven, but Nature herself...
The process of reproduction had seven stages also in
each Race, each covering aeons of time. . .Primeval

human hermaphrodites are a fact in Nature well
known to the ancients, and form one of Darwin’s
greatest perplexities.
The Occult Doctrine, anyhow, can be advantage­
ously compared with that of the most liberal men of
science, who have theorised upon the origin of the
first man.
20. THEIR FATHERS WERE THE SELF-BORN. THE
SELF-BORN, THE CHHAYAS FROM THE BRILLI­
ANT BODIES OF THE LORDS, THE FATHERS, THE
SONS OF TWILIGHT (a).
(a) The “shadows,” or Chhayas, are called the
sons cf the “self-born,” as the latter name is applied
to all the gods- and Beings born through the Will,
whether of Deity or Adept. The Homunculi of Para­
celsus would, perhaps, be also given this name,
though the latter process is on a far more material
plane.
The name “Sons of Twilight” shows that the
“Self-born” progenitors of our doctrine are identical
with the Pitris of the Brahmanical system. (See the
Puranas).
21. WHEN THE RACE BECAME OLD, THE OLD WATERS
MIXED WITH THE FRESHER WATERS (a) ; WHEN
THE DROPS BECAME TURBID, THEY VANISHED
AND DISAPPEARED IN THE NEW STREAM, IN
THE HOT STREAM OF LIFE. THE OUTER OF THE
FIRST BECAME THE INNER OF THE SECOND. (6).
THE OLD WING BECAME THE SHADOW, AND THE
SHADOW OF THE WING (c).
(a) The old (primitive) Race merged in the Se­
cond Race, and became one with it.
(b) This is the mysterious process of trans­
formation and evolution of mankind. The material
of the first forms—shadowy, ethereal, and negative—
was drawn or absorbed into, and thus became the
110
complement of the forms of the Second Race. There
was no death in those days of a period more blissful
than the Golden Age; but the first, or parent material
was used for the formation of the new being, to form
the body and even the inner or lower principles or
bodies of the progeny.
(c) When the shadow retires, i.e., when the
astral body becomes covered with more solid flesh,
man developes a physical body. The “Wing” or the
ethereal form that produced its shadow and image,
became the shadow of the astral body and its own
progeny. The expression is queer but original.
The dual meaning of the Greek myth bearing on
this particular phase of evolution is found in the
several, variants of the allegory of Leda and her two
sons Castor and Pollux. . . The first three Races of
the Secret Doctrine are hidden under the most in­
genious symbology in the first four chapters of
Genesis. ; j
Behold the imperishable witness to the evolution
of the human races from the divine, and especially
from the Androgynous Race: the Egyptian Sphinx,
that Riddle of the Ages! Divine wisdom incarnating
on earth, and forced to taste of the bitter fruit of
personal experience of pain and suffering, generated
under the shade of the Tree of the knowledge of Good
and Evil—a secret first known only to the Elohim,
the s e l f -in it ia t e d , “higher gods”—on earth only
(See Book of Enoch).
THE EVOLUTION OF THE “SWEAT-BORN.”
(22) The evolution of the three Races continued. (23)
The Second Race creates the Third and perishes.
22. THEN THE SECOND EVOLVED THE SWEAT-BORN,
THE THIRD (RACE). THE SWEAT GREW, ITS
DROPS GREW, AND THE DROPS BECAME HARD
AND ROUND. THE SUN WARMED IT; THE MOON
COOLED AND SHAPED IT; THE WIND FED IT
UNTIL ITS RIPENESS. THE WHITE SWAN FROM
THE STARRY VAULT (THE MOON) OVERSHADOW­
ED THE BIG DROP. THE EGG OF THE FUTURE
RACE, THE MAN-SWAN (HAMSA) OF THE LATER
THIRD (a). FIRST MALE-FEMALE, THEN MAN
AND WOMAN (6).
(a) The text of the Stanza clearly implies that
the human embryo was nourished ab extra by Cosmic
forces, and that the “Father-Mother” furnished ap­
parently the germ that ripened: in all probability a
“sweatborn egg”, to be hatched out, in some mysteri­
ous way, disconnected from the “double” parent. It
is comparatively easy to conceive of an oviparous
humanity, since even now man is, in one sense, “egg-
born.”
The First Race having created the Second by
“budding,” as just explained, the Second Race gives
birth to the Third, which is itself separated into three
distinct divisions consisting of men differently pro­
created . . . The first two of these are produced by an
oviparous method presumably unknown to modern
Natural History. While the early sub-races of the
STANZA VI.
111
112
Third Humanity procreated their species by a kind of
exudation of moisture of vital fluid, the drops of
which coalescing formed an oviform ball (or shall we
say egg?), which served as an extraneous vehicle for
the generation therein of a foetus and child, the mode
of procreation by the later sub-races changed, in its
results at all events. The little ones of the earlier
races were entirely sexless-—shapeless even for all
one knows (see Plato’s Timaeus), but those of the
later races were born androgynous. It is in the Third
Root Race that the Separation of Sexes occurred.
From being1previously a-sexual, Humanity became
distinctly hermaphrodite or bi-sexual; and finally the
man-bearing eggs began to give birth, gradually and
almost imperceptibly in their evolutionary develop­
ment, first to Beings in which one sex predominated
over the other, and finally to distinct men and women
(132).
23. THE SELF-BORN WERE THE CHHAYAS, THE
SHADOWS FROM THE BODIES OF THE SONS OF
TWILIGHT. NEITHER WATER NOR FIRE COULD
DESTROY THEM. THEIR SONS WERE (SO DE­
STROYED). (a).
(a) The “shadows” were too ethereal to be af­
fected by any element—flood or fire. But their “Sons,”
the Second Root Race, could be and were sd destroyed.
. . . in the first great throes of the evolution and
consolidation of the globe during the human period. Of
such great cataclysms there have already been four.
And we may expect a fifth for ourselves in due course
of time. They are far more terrible and intense in this
than in the preceding Rounds, owing to this being the
Round in which the greatest physical development
takes place (149).
STANZA VII,
FROM THE SEMI-DIVINE DOWN TO THE
FIRST HUMAN RAGES.
(24) The higher creators reject in their pride the forms
evolved by the “Sons of Yoga.” (25) They will not incarnate
in the early “Egg-born.” (26) They select the later androgynes.
(27) The first man endowed with mind.
24. THE SONS OF WISDOM, THE SONS OF NIGHT (IS­
SUED FROM THE BODY OF BRAHMA WHEN IT
BECAME NIGHT), READY FOR RE-BIRTII, CAME
DOWN. THEY SAW THE (INTELLECTUALLY)
VILE FORMS OF THE FIRST THIRD (STILL SENSE­
LESS RACE) (a). “WE CAN CHOOSE,” SAID THE
LORDS, “WE HAVE WISDOM.” SOME ENTERED
THE CHHAYAS. SOME PROJECTED A SPARK.
SOME DEFERRED TILL THE FOURTH (RACE).
FROM THEIR OWN ESSENCE THEY FILLED (IN­
TENSIFIED) THE KAMA (VEHICLE OF DESIRE).
THOSE WHO RECEIVED BUT A SPARK REMAINED
DESTITUTE OF (HIGHER) KNOWLEDGE. THE
SPARK BURNT LOW (6). THE THIRD REMAINED
MINDLESS. THEIR JIVAS (MONADS) WERE NOT
READY. THESE WERE SET APART AMONG THE
SEVEN (PRIMITIVE HUMAN SPECIES). THEY
(BECAME THE) NARROW-HEADED. THE THIRD
WERE READY. IN THESE SHALL WE DWELL,
SAID THE LORDS OF THE FLAME AND OF THE
DARK WISDOM (c).
This Stanza contains, in itself, the whole key to
the mysteries of evil, the so-called Fall of the Angels,
and the many problems that have puzzled the brains
of the philosophers from the time that the memory
of man began. It solves the secret of the subsequent
113
114
inequalities of intellectual capacity, of birth or social
position, and gives a logical explanation of the in­
comprehensible Karmic course throughout the aeons
which followed.
(a) Up to the Fourth Round, and even to the
later part of the Third Race in this Round, Man—if
the ever-changing forms that clothed the Monads
during the first three Rounds and the first two and
a half races of the present one can be given that mis­
leading name—is, so far, only an animal intellectual­
ly. It is only in the actual midway Round [Fourth]
that he developes in himself entirely the Fourth
Principle [Kama or Desire] as a fit vehicle for the
Fifth [Manas or Mind]. But Manas will be, rela­
tively, fully developed only in the following [Fifth]
Round, when it will have an opportunity of becoming
entirely divine until the end of the Rounds.
(b) Here the inferior Races, of which there
are still some analogues left—as the Australians (now
fast dying out) and some African and Oceanic tribes
—are meant. “They were not ready” signifies that
the Karmic development of these Monads had not yet
fitted them to occupy the forms of men destined for
incarnation in higher intellectual Races.
(c) The Zohar speaks of “Black Fire” which is
Absolute Light-—
Wisdom. To those who, prompted
by old theological prejudice, may say: “Butthe Asuras
are the rebel Devas, the opponents of the Gods—
hence devils, and the spirits of Evil”, it is answered:
Esoteric philosophy admits neither good nor evil per
se, as existing independently in Nature. . . . It identi­
fies the pre-Brahmanical Asuras, Rudras, Ralcshasas
and all the “Adversaries” of the Gods in the allegories,
with the Egos, which, by incarnating in the still witless
man of the Third Race, made him consciously immortal.
They are, then, during the cycle of Incarnations, the
115
true dual Logos—the conflicting and two-faced divine
Principle in Man.
Recapitulating, we find (168) :—That the Secret
Doctrine claims for man, (1) a polygenetic origin.
(2) A variety of modes of procreation before
humanity fell into the present method of generation.
(3) That the evolution of animals—of the mammalians
at any rate—follows that of man instead of preceding
it. And this is diametrically opposed to the now
generally accepted theories of evolution and the de­
scent of man from an animal ancestor. . . Man is the
Alpha and Omega of objective creation.
25. HOW DID THE MANASA THE SONS OF WISDOM
ACT? THEY REJECTED THE SELF-BORN (THE
BONELESS). THEY ARE NOT READY. THEY
SPURNED THE (FIRST) SWEAT-BORN. THEY
ARE NOT QUITE READY. THEY WOULD NOT
ENTER THE (FIRST) EGG-BORN.
To a Theist or a Christian this verse would sug­
gest a rather theological idea: that of the Fall of
the Angels through Pride. In the Secret Doctrine,
however, the refusal to incarnate in half-ready
physical bodies seems to be more connected with
physiological than metaphysical reasons. Not all the
organisms were sufficiently ready. The incarnating1
powers chose the ripest fruits and spurned the rest.
By a curious coincidence, when selecting a fami­
liar name for the continent on which the first andro­
gynes, the Third Root Race, separated, the writer
[H. P. B.] chose, on geographical considerations, that
of “Lemuria”, invented by Mr. P.L. Sclater. It was
only later that, on reading Haeckel’s Pedigree of Man,
it was found that the German, “Animalist” had chosen
the name for his late continent. He traces, properly
enough, the centre of human evolution to “Lemuria”,
116
but with a slight scientific variation. Speaking of it
as that “cradle of mankind”, he pictures the gradual
transformation of the anthropoid mammal into the
primeval savage!!.... We shall examine this claim
later in the light of Esoteric Philosophy [Stanza; X.
“Modern Science on Man and the Anthropoid Ape.”].
Meanwhile let us give a few moments of attention to
the various consecutive modes of procreation accord­
ing to the laws of Evolution.
Let us begin by the mode of reproduction of the
later sub-races of the Third human race, by those
who found themselves endowed with the Sacred Fire
from the ‘Spark’ of high and independent Beings,
who were the psychic and spiritual parents of Man,
as the lower Pitar Devata (Lunar Pitris) were the
progenitors of his physical body. That Third and
holy Race consisted of men who, at their zenith, were
described as “towering giants of godly strength and
beauty, and the depositaries of all mysteries of
Heaven and Earth,” Have they likewise fallen, if,
then, incarnation was the Fall?
Of this presently. The only thing now to be
noted of these is, that the chief gods and heroes of
the Fourth and Fifth Root Races [Atlanteans and
Aryans],-as of later antiquity, are the deified images
of these men of the Third,. The days of their physio­
logical purity, and those of their so-called Fall, have
equally survived in the hearts and memories of their
descendants. Hence, the dual nature shown in those
gods, both virtue and sin being exalted to their high­
est degree in the biographies composed by posterity.
They were the pre-Adamite and the divine Races,
with which even theology, in whose sight they are all
“the accursed Cainite Races”, now begins to busy
itself.
117
But the action of the “spiritual progenitors” of
that Race has first to be disposed of. A very difficult
and abstruse point has to be explained with regard
to verses 26 and 27. These s a y —
26. WHEN THE SWEAT-BORN PRODUCED THE EGG
BORN, THE TWO-FOLD (ANDROGYNE THIRD
RACE), THE MIGHTY, THE POWERFUL WITH
BONES, THE LORDS OF WISDOM SAID: “NOW
SHALL WE CREATE.” (a)
Why “now”and not earlier? This the following
sloka explains.
27. (THEN) THE THIRD (RACE) BECAME ' THE
VAHAN (VEHICLES) OF THE LORDS OF WISDOM.'
IT CREATED SONS OF ‘‘WILL AND YOGA”, BY
KRIYASAKTI (6) IT CREATED THEM, THE HOLY
FATHERS, ANCESTORS OF THE ARHATS. . . .
(a) How did they create, since the “Lords of
Wisdom” are identical with the Hindu Devas, who
refuse “to create”? Clearly they are the Kumaras of
the Hindu Pantheon and Purdnas, those elder sons of
Brahma, “Sananda and the other sons of Vedhas”,
who, previously created by him “without desire or
passion, remained chaste, full of holy wisdom, and
undesirous of progeny.”
The power, by which they first created,' is just
that which has since caused them to be degraded from
their high status to the position of evil spirits, of
Satan and his Host, created in their turn by the un­
clean fancy of exoteric creeds. It was by (6),
Kriyasakti, that mysterious and divine power
latent in the will of every man, and which, if not
called to life, quickened and developed by Yogi-train­
ing [Rdja Yoga], remains dormant in 999,999 men
out of a million, and gets atrophied.
118
These spiritual forefathers of all the subsequent
and present Arhats or Mahatmas [Initiates], were
thus created in a truly immaculate way; not begotten,
as were their brethren of the Fourth Race, who were
generated sexually after the separation of the sexes,
thei Fall of Man. For creation is but the result of
Will acting on phenomenal matter, the calling forth
out of it the primordial divine Light and eternal Life.
They were the “holy seed-grain” of the future
Saviours of Humanity.
The order of evolution of the Races stands thus
in the Fifth Book of the Commentaries:
The First men were Chhayas; the Second, the
“Sweat-born”; the Third, “Egg-born”, and the Holy
Fathers born by the power of Kriyasakti; the Fourth
■were the children of Padmdpani.
All these are to be found in the Puranic
allegories. The “children of Padmdpani” are the
remnants of the seventh sub-race of the Fourth Root
Race; those “of the Yellow hue” who were saved from
the Deluge & fled to Central Asia. Their descendants
include the Chinese, Mongolians, Tibetans, Malays,
Hungarians, Finns, and Esquimaux [see II, 425].
Padmapani as Protector of Asia.
Padmdpani (Lit. Lotus-Bom) is the first divine
ancestor of the Tibetans, and as such he is the Pro­
tector of Tibet in particular and Asia in general. He
is Avalokiteshwara (Lit. The Lord who is Seen or
looked up to), who is the Mind-born Son or Bod-
hisattva of Amitdbha, of whom Gautama Buddha
was the Manushi or earthly manifestation (See
Table at p. 137 B.S.L. 2nd. ed.) His Tibetan
name is Chenresi Wangchug, the “Powerful All-
seeing.” As the Table shows, these three, Amitdbha-
• •
V
P A D M A P A N I T H E P R O T E C T O R O P A S IA
and
S Y N T H E S IS O F T H E R A C ES.
The Third Eye (see p. 142) is shown on the faces of each Race.
119
Avalokiteshwara-Gautama, belong to the close of
the Fourth Race, and preside over the Fifth
until Amogasiddha-Vfsvapani-Maitreya succeed them,
“after the partial destruction of the Fifth and when
the Sixth Race will be established already for some
hundred thousands of years on earth” (Ibid. 136-7).
This is why Padmapani (Chenresi) is spoken of as
the father of the Fourth Race, for he is the progenitor
(in a spiritual sense) of men on the manifested plane.
It is believed that he will incarnate as “the most per­
fect Buddha” in Tibet, instead of in India, where his
predecessors, the great Rishis and Manus had ap­
peared in the beginning of our Race, but now appear
no longer-
He is evidently the Synthesis of all the preceding
Races, and the Progenitor of all the human Races
after the Third (the first complete one), and thus is
represented as the culmination of the four primeval
races in his eleven-faced form, the heads of which
are in tiers of three each, with complexions according
to the colours of the first four Root Races (as given
in Stanza X, v. 39 post). In the fourth tier the third
face is left blank to indicate the untimely end of the
Atlanteans, the brown race who “became black with
sin.” Padmdpani is at the apex. The illustration is
from a Chinese original in which the faces representing
the Races are coloured as above described.
Chenresi’s other name is Chantong, “he of the-
thousand eyes,” when he is endowed with a multi­
plicity of arms, the Eye of Wisdom being depicted
on the palm of each hand. The Bodhisattva’s com­
passion for humanity is thus symbolised as “A thou­
sand eyes to perceive its sufferings, and a thousand
hands stretched out to help.” His female aspect is
120
seen in the Chinese Kwan-Yin and the Japanese Kivan-
non.
The belief that Tibet is under the special protec­
tion of Chenresi is highly significant, in view of the
fact that Panchen Rimpoche, the Tashi Lama, is re-
jgarded as an incarnation of Amitdbha (See B.S.L.
69), for he is its Priest-King-Initiate.
In Esoteric Philosophy Avalokiteshwara is both
the Logos and the Higher Self (Atma-Budclhi) of
man, while Padmdpani is the Higher Ego (Buddhi-
Manas), and it is to invoke their help that the Tibetans
so constantly intone Aum Mani Padme Hum, which
is addressed to “the Jewel in the Lotus”, i.e., the
“God Within.”
The Sanskrit Avalokiteshwara is a compound of
Avalokita and Ishwara, and in explaining the mean­
ing to Mr. Sinnett, the Initiate K.H. says (M.L. 343):
“Avalokita Ishwara literally interpreted means
“the Lord that is seen”; Ishwara implying, moreover,
rather the adjective than the noun:—lordly, self-
existent lordliness, not Lord. It is, when correctly
interpreted, in one sense “the Divine Self perceived
or seen by Self” [the personality], the Atman or
seventh principle rid of its mayavic distinction from
its universal source—which becomes the object of
perception for and by the individuality centred in
Buddhi (the sixth principle),—something that hap­
pens only in the highest state of Samadhi. This is
applying it to the microcosm [man].
STANZA VIII.
EVOLUTION OF THE ANIMAL MAM-
MALIANS.—THE FIRST FALL.
§§ (28) How the first mammals were produced. (29) A
quasi-Darwinian Evolution. (30) The animals get solid bodies.
(31) Their separation into sexes. (32) The first sin of the
mindless men.
28. FROM THE DROPS OF SWEAT (a); FROM THE
RESIDUE OF THE SUBSTANCE; MATTER FROM
DEAD BODIES AND ANIMALS OF THE WHEEL
BEFORE (PREVIOUS, THIRD ROUND) ; AND FROM
CAST-OFF DUST; THE FIRST ANIMALS (OF THE
FOURTH ROUND) WERE PRODUCED.
(a) The Occult doctrine maintains that, in this
Round, the mammalians were a later work of evolution
than man. Evolution proceeds in cycles. The great
Manvantaric cycle of Seven Rounds, beginning in the
First Round with mineral, vegetable, and animal,
brings its evolutionary work on the descending arc to
a dead stop in the middle of the Fourth Race, at the
close of the first half of the Fourth Round.
It is on our Earth, then, (the Fourth sphere and
the lowest) and in the present [Fourth] Round, that
this middle point has been reached. And since the
Monad has passed, after its “first inmetallization” bn
Globe A, through the mineral, vegetable and animal
worlds in every degree of the three states of matter,
except the last degree of the third or solid state,
121
122
which it reached only at the “mid-point of evolution”,
it is but logical and natural that at the beginning of
the Fourth Round on Globe D [our Earth], Man
should he the first to appear; and also that his frame
should be of the most tenuous matter that is com­
patible with objectivity.
Furthermore, it must be noted here that it is at
precisely this mid-point of the Fourth Round that the
“Door” into the human kingdom closes, and hencefor­
ward the number of Monads in the human stage of
development is complete. For the Monads which had
not reached the human stage at this point will, owing
to the evolution of humanity itself, find themselves so
>
far behind that they will reach the human stage only
at the close of the Seventh and last Round, and will
form the humanity of a future Manvantara. [I, 173].
This order of evolution is found also in Genesis
(ch, 1 and 2) if one reads it in its true esoteric sense;
for chapter 1 contains the history of the first Three
Rounds, as well as that of the first Three Races of
the Fourth Round up to the moment when man is
called to conscious life by the Elohim of Wisdom. In
the first chapter, animals, whales and fowls of the
air, are created before the androgyne Adam. In the!
second, Adam (the sexless) comes first, and the
animals only appear after him. His “deep sleep”
symbolizes the mental torpor and unconsciousness of
the first two Races and the first half of the Third.
The Puranas, the Chaldean and Egyptian frag­
ments, and also the Chinese traditons, all show an
agreement with the Secret Doctrine as to the process
and order of evolution.
The four great continents on which the four
great Root Racesi preceding our Adamic or Fifth Race
lived were:
123
I. The “Imperishable Sacred Land”, the only-
one to last from the beginning to the end of the
Manvantara throughout each Round. It is the cradle
of the first man and the dwelling of the last divine
mortal who will be the seed of the next humanity.
II. The “Hyperborean”, home of the Second Race,
which comprised the whole of what is now known as
Northern Asia, which was connected by the Greeks
with the Sun God Apollo.
III. Lemuria, a name applied on zoological
grounds by Mr. P.L. Sclater to a gigantic continent
in the Pacific. Here the Third Race evolved physical
man in separate sexes as we now know him, some
eighteen million years ago.
IV. Atlantis, developed from the Atlantic end
of Lemuria as the abode of the Fourth Race.
V. The Fifth (Aryan) Root Race was born in
Northern Asia, spreading southwards towards the
Gobi, westwards towards Europe and eastwards to
America, then connected by land where the Aleutian
Islands and Behring Strait now are.
The first sub-race of this Root Race (the Aryan-
Asiatics) witnessed the doom of the last of the
populations of the “Giant Atlanteans” who perished
some 850,000 years ago (the Ruta and Daitya Island-
Continents) towards the close of the Miocene Age.
The Fourth sub-race (early Greeks, Romans,
Egyptians, etc.) witnessed the destruction of the last
remnant of the Atlanteans (the Aryo-Atlanteans) in
the last island fragment of Atlantis (Plato's
Poseidonis) some 11,000 years ago. The Romans
were descendants of these.
29. ANIMALS WITH BONES, DRAGONS OF THE DEEP
AND FLYING SARPAS (SERPENTS) WERE AD-
DED TO THE CREEPING THINGS. THEY THAT
124
CREEP ON THE GROUND GOT WINGS. THEY OF
THE LONG NECKS IN THE WATER BECAME THE
PROGENITORS OF THE FOWLS OF THE AIR (a),
(a) This is a point on which the teachings and
modern biological speculation are in perfect accord.
The missing links representing this transition process
between reptile and bird are apparent to the veriest
bigot, especially in the ornilhoscelidae, hesperomis,
and the archaeopteryx of Vogt.
30. DURING THE THIRD (RACE) THE BONELESS
ANIMALS GREW AND CHANGED. THEY BECAME
ANIMALS WITH BONES (a), THEIR CHHAYAS
BECAME SOLID (ALSO).
31. THE ANIMALS SEPARATED FIRST (INTO MALE
AND FEMALE) (6). .
(a) Vertebrates, and after that mammalians.
Before that the animals were also ethereal proto-or­
ganisms, just as man was.
(b) The fact of former hermaphrodite mam­
mals and the subsequent separation of sexes is now
indisputable, even from the standpoint of Biology.
. . . THEY (THE ANIMALS) BEGAN TO BREED.
THE TWO-FOLD (THEN) SEPARATED ALSO. HE
(MAN) SAID: “LET US AS THEY; LET US UNITE
AND MAKE CREATURES.” THEY DID. . . .
32. AND THOSE WHICH HAD NO SPARK (THE
“NARROW-HEADED”*) TOOK HUGE SHE-ANIMALS

'24. The “Sons of Wisdom” had spurned the early
Third Race, i.e. the non-developed, and are shown in­
carnating in, and thereby endowing with intellect, the
later Third Race. Thus the sin of the brainless or
“mindless” Races, who had no “spark” and were
irresponsible, fell upon those who failed to do by them
their Karmic duty..

our modern scientists would emphasise if they could

The point most insisted upon by the Evolutionists
Is that, “The history of the embryo is an epitome of
that of the race.” That “every organism, in its
development from the egg, runs through a series of
forms, through which, in like succession, its ancestors
have passed in the long course of the Earth’s history.
The history of the embryo... is a picture in little, and
outline of that of the race. This conception forms the
gist of the study of the fundamental law of organic
development” (Haeckel in The Proofs of Evolution).
This modern theory was known as a fact to, and far
more philosophically expressed by, the Sages and
Occultists from the remotest ages. . . Any anatomist
who has made the development and growth of the
embryo “a subject of special study” can tell without
much brain work what daily experience and evidence
of his own eyes show him, viz., that up to a certain
/
period the human embryo is a facsimile of a young*
batrachian in its first remove from the spawn—a
tadpole. But no physiologist or anatomist seems to
have had the idea of applying to the development of
the human being—from the first instant of its
physical appearance as a germ to its ultimate forma­
tion and birth—the Pythagorean esoteric doctrine of
metempsychosis, so erroneously interpreted by critics.
The meaning of the axiom, “A stone becomes a plant;
a plant, a beast; a beast, a man”, etc. was mentioned
in another place in relation to the spiritual and
physical evolution of men on this Earth. [187].

THE FINAL EVOLUTION OF MAN.
§§ (33) The Creators repent. (34) They atone for their
neglect. (35) Men become endowed with minds. (36) The
Fourth Race developes perfect speech. (37) Every androgy­
nous unit is separated and becomes bisexual.
33. SEEING WHICH (THE SIN COMMITTED WITH
THE ANIMALS), THE LHAS (THE SPIRITS, THE
“SONS OF WISDOM”) WHO HAD NOT BUILT MEN
(WHO HAD REFUSED TO CREATE), WEPT, SA Y ­
ING:—

35. THEN ALL BECAME ENDOWED WITH MANAS
(MIND). THEY SAIF THE SIN OF THE MINDLESS.
But they had already ,separated before the ray
■of divine reason had enlightened the dark region of
their hitherto slumbering minds, and had sinned.
That is to say, they had committed evil unconsciously,
by producing an effect which was unnatural. Yet,
like the other six primitive brother or fellow races,
oven so this seventh, henceforth degenerated race,
which will have to bide its time for its final develop­
ment on account of the sin committed,—even this race
will find itself on the last day on one of the Seven
Paths. For “the wise guard the home of nature’s
order; they assume excellent forms in secret.”
127
128
This verse in the Rig Veda (X, 5-6) runs: “The
seven wise ones (Rays of Wisdom; Dhyanis) fashion-
Seven Paths (or lines, as also Races in another sense).
To one of these may the distressed mortal come.” It
is one of the most pregnant in occult meaning.
36. THE FOURTH RACE DEVELOPED SPEECH.
I. Monosyllabic : that of the first approximate­
ly fully developed human beings at the close of the
Third Root Race, the “golden-coloured”, yellow-com-
plexioned men, after their separation into sexes, and
the full awakening of their minds.
II. A gglutinative: spoken by some Atlantean
races, while other parent stocks of the Fourth Race
preserved the mother-language. In this form
qualifying words are added as suffixes, making longer
or shorter compound words, instead of inflecting the
principal word or allowing the qualifying word to-
stand alone. Includes Hungarian, Finnish, Turkish,.
Mongolian, and Dravidian (Tamil, Telegu).
III. Inflectional : Left as an heirloom by the
Atlanteans to the nascent Fifth Root Race (Aryans).
This was the root of the Sanskrit, the classical lan­
guage of the Brahmins, never known or spoken in its
true systematized form except by the initiated
Brahmins, as it was pre-eminently a “mystery lan­
guage.”
37. THE ONE (A N D R O G Y N E ) BECAME TWO; ALSO
ALL THE LIVING AND CREEPING THINGS THAT
WERE STILL O N E: GIANT FISH-BIRDS, A N D
SERPENTS WITH SHELL-HEADS (a).
(a) This relates evidently to the so-called age
of the amphibious reptiles, during which science
maintains that no man existed! But what could the
ancients know of antediluvian prehistoric animals
and monsters! Nevertheless, in Book VI of the C om -
129
■mentaries is found a passage which says, freely
translated:—
“When the Third separated and fell into sin by
breeding man-animals, these (the animals) became
ferocious,\ and men and they mutually destructive. Till
then, there teas no sin, no life taken. After (the
separation) the Satya (Yuga) was at an end. The
eternal spring became constant change, and seasons
■succeeded. Cold forced men to build shelters and devise
clothing. Then man appealed to the superior Fathers
(the higher gods or angels). The Nirmdnakaya of the
Ndgas (Buddhas). Divine Kings descended and
taught men sciences and arts, for man could live no
longer on the first land (Adi-Varsha, the Eden of the
first Races), which had turned into a ivhite frozen
corpse.”
[From this it is evident that all the sin and
suffering on this earth originated with the misuse of
the divine creative function after mankind separated
into sexes, including even changes of season. Satya
Yuga is the Golden Age. Ndga (Sk. “Serpent”) stands
esoterically for an Adept or Initiate. Apollonius of
Tyana studied with the Buddhist Ndgas of Kashmir.
Nirmanakaya is the vesture assumed by the Buddha
or other great Adept who has won Nirvana but
prefers to remain in the Earth sphere in order to help
humanity. Adi-Varsha is the “Imperishable Sacred
Land,” now hidden at the North Pole, which survives
all the cataclysms.]
The allegory of Adam, in Genesis, being driven
away from the “Tree of Life” means, esoterically,
that the newly-separated Race abused and dragged the
Mystery of Life down into the region of animalism
130
and bestiality.. .The separation of the sexes was in
the programme of nature and of natural evolution;,
and the creative faculty in male and female was a
gift of Divine wisdom, which was abused and degraded
by them, as said above.

(SURA BECAME A-SURA).
(a) To understand this verse it must be read
together with the three verses of Stanza IX. Up to
this point of evolution man belongs more to meta­
physical than physical nature. It is only after the
so-called F all that the races began to develope
rapidly into a purely human shape. And, in order
that he may correctly comprehend the full meaning
of the Fall, so mystic and transcendental is it in its
real significance, the student must be told at once
the details which preceded this event; of which
event modern theology has formed a pivot on which
its most pernicious and absurd dogmas and beliefs
are made to turn.
[These details are summarised as follows in my
pamphlet, The Secret Doctrine on the Problem and
Evolution of Sex (“The Blavatsky Pamphlets.” No.
131
1
3

2) p. 2 et seq. I have altered the wording some­
what, and added some further details.—B.C.l:—
The following summary of the incarnation of
the principle of Mind (Manas), and the errors and
sins which followed man’s abuse of the divine crea­
tive gift, should be carefully studied and memorised,
because they furnish the key to our present con­
dition, and the only complete and logical answer
to the vital problem of sex.
The history cf mankind, in its present form as
separate sexes, goes back about eighteen million
years, to the middle of the Third Race on the Pacific
continent of Lemuria, when the element of Mind
began to incarnate. Up till then Man was “an
empty, senseless Bhuta” (“form” or “shadow”), the
product of two streams of evolution, the Monadic
or Spiritual, and the Material or Physical. Mind
(Manas) added a third stream to Man only (I, 181).
Reproduction evolved in the earlier Races as
follows:—
F irst R ace.— Self-Born from the SELF-EXIS­
TENT, the Prajapati or Pitris.
Second R ace.— Sweat-Bom by budding and ex­
pansion, the a-sexual form from the sexless shadow.
T hird Race.— Egg-Born; at first Sexless, then.
Androgynous, and finally separate sexes.
All these processes are re-enacted in the stages,
of the present human embryo. The early oviparous
stage of this Race is thus described in the Commen­
tary (11.166) : “The emanations that came out of
their bodies during the seasons of procreation* were
*Man followed Nature’s law in this respect before his
misuse of the creative power began; and those animals not
under his influence still follow it. See also pp. 410, §3, and
412: “The animal element, and conciousness of its possession,
has changed periodical instinct into chronic animalism and
sensuality,” which is our present condition. Before the
American Buffalo was practically exterminated by the whits
man, it was observed that the sexes lived in separate herds
during most of the year, the cows being guarded by a few
aged bulls.
1

ovulary; the small spheroidal nuclei developing into
a large, soft, egg-like vehicle, gradually hardened. •
Then, after a period of gestation, it broke, and the
young human animal issued from it unaided, as the
fowls do in our Race.”
The process of separation began in this egg
stage, one sex predominating more and more over
the other, until, in the course of ages, separate
sexes were born.
The Commentary says that, before the eggs
hardened they were often tampered with by huge
animals of species now unknown, and monsters re­
sulted which were not permitted to live. The newly-
born babe lost the faculty of walking at the end of
the fifth sub-race of the Third Root Race. (192).
The animals, which are all the product of man’s
vital energy thrown off in the early stages of this
Round, were the first to separate into sexes and
breed, their example being followed later by the
similarly separated human beings (Verses 31-2). It
was then that the “Sin of the Mindless” took place.
Stages in the Incarnation of the Mind
Principle.
The early sub-races of the Third Root Race
evolved by sexless creative instinct an “Intermediate
Race” in which the higher Dhyan-Chohans incar­
nated at the time the Separation into Sexes took
place. These were the “Sons of Will and Yoga”
already 'mentioned as being born in a truly im-
7naculate way. They represent the first full incar­
nation of the Mind principle, which is something
much higher than our mentality, for these Beings
had “already reached, during previous cycles of
incarnation, that degree of intellect which enabled
them to become independent and self-conscious en­
tities on this plane of matter”.
184
A second class of Egos did not incarnate fully
at once, but chose to wait, projecting only a
“spark” of mind. It is these partial incarnations
who “constitute the average humanity, which has
lo acquire its intellectuality during the present Man-
vantaric evolution” (167).
We, the humanity of to-day, belong in various
degrees to this class, and can only win to the state
of the fully incarnated Ego (i.e. union with the
Higher Self or true Manas) and “immortality on
Earth”, by following the stern and unbending laws
laid down by the descendants of the “Sons of Will
and Yoga”, who stand always ready to help the
aspirant in his upward struggles. The first and most
important of these is the absolute conquest of sex
and of the personality, which “is the drag and poison
cn the inner man in his upward progress. Mankind
was never more selfish and vicious than he is now”
( 110) .
The sin of the brainless or mindless races fell
upon those who had failed to do by them their
Karmic duty. Thereupon, seeing this Karmic re­
sult, the Sons of Wisdom endowed all men with
Manas “lest worse should happen.” This entry of
the third stream of evolution “raised Man far above
all the rest of ‘Creation’.”
A third class of Egos deferred until the Fourth
or Atlantean Root Race, the progenitors of which
were those of the later Third “who had failed to
master their lower natures.” It was, therefore, in
this Race that the worst sexual Karma was incurred;
for the Atlanteans renewed the sin of the Mindless,
but this time with full knowledge and responsibility
because they possessed Manas (from which our word
“man” is derived).
1
3
5
Some of the still semi-divine beings took entire­
ly human wives in whom lower, more material, be­
ings had incarnated. These latter had no mind,
only animal instinct, being descendants of the half­
animal monsters bred by the “sin of the Mindless”
in the Third Race (2.84). Moreover, in this case,
it was the “Spiritual being who sinned, the Spirit ele­
ment being still the “Master’ principle in man in
those days” (303), and “many of us are now work­
ing off the effects of the evil Karmic causes pro­
duced by us when in Atlantean bodies.”
The anthropoid apes are the “degenerate des­
cendants” of this renewed and conscious sin. They
are truly “speechless men”, ana are millions of years
later than the speaking human being. They will be­
come speaking animals (or men of a lower order)
in the Fifth Round; while the Adepts of a certain
school hope that some of the Egos of the apes of a
higher intelligence will re-appear at the close of the
Sixth Root Race (262).
As to those Sons of Wisdom who had deferred
their incarnation till the Fourth Race, which
was already stained (physiologically) with sin and
impurity, they produced a terrible cause, the Karmic
result of which weighs on them to this day. It was
produced in themselves, and they became the carriers
of that seed of iniquity for aeons to come, because
the bodies they had to inform had become defiled
through their own procrastination.” (See verses 32,
36).
“This was the Fall of the Angels, because of
their rebellion against Karmic Law. The ‘fall of
man’ was no fall, for he was irresponsible.”
It is clear, then, that to this “seed of iniquity”
must be attributed the formidable nature of the
sex problem to-day, as manifested in a thousand
forms, not only physically, but also, what is much
worse, psychically and menially. How are we to
subdue the monster created by our own folly and
sensuality in the far past? The teaching of the
great Sages is that no form of indulgence is admis­
sible, if we are to work off the evil Karma and regain
136
the lost purity of the early Third Root Race. That
any use of the sex function, other than its legitimate
one of physical reproduction of the species, in­
evitably leads to fresh bad Karma, increasing in­
stead of lessening the load we have to bear. We
are further told that the present sexual condition
of Mankind is wholly abnormal; But modern Ma­
terialistic science, ignorant of the early history of
human evolution, persists in regarding it as normal
and unalterable.*
*It should now be perfectly clear that the present “Birth-
Control” propagandists do not take into consideration any but
the purely materialistic economic aspect, and must inevitably
make matters worse instead of better for mankind, if we ac­
cept as true and reasonable the history of its evolution as
set forth in this brief summary from The Secret Doctrine.
This pernicious and soul-destroying movement began with the
Neo-Malthusian American work sponsored in England by
Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant, concerning which the
Initiate K. H. wrote as follows to Mr. A. P. Sinnett in 1884:
“The book published by them— The Fruits of Philosophy, is
infamous and highly pernicious in its effects, whatever and
however beneficent and philanthropic the objects that led to
the publication of the work, j
l regret, very deeply, my dear
friend, to be obliged to differ widely in my views upon the
said subject from you. . .. I have not read the work—nor
ever will; but I have its unclean spirit, its brutal aura before
me, and I say again, in my sight the advices offered in the
work are abominable; they are the fruits of Sodom and
Gomorrah rather than of Philosophy, the very name of which
it degrades” (M.L. 405). It ought, perhaps, to be explained
here that the invisible “aura” which surrounds every person
or object automatically records everything connected with
it; and can be read like an open book by a trained seer. A
high Initiate, such as K.H. and all members of the Trans-
Himalayan Brotherhood, have developed this and all the Yoga
powers to the highest degree. Belonging to a noble Indian
family, his severe condemnation of the Neo-Malthusian work
may be regarded as typical of the best Indian feeling, and
as applying with even more justification to the later and
much more extended system of an English lady doctor, whose
series of hooks on the subject are to be seen to-day openly
displayed for sale all over the world.

(a) This verse relates exclusively to the racial
divisions. Strictly speaking, Esoteric Philosophy
teaches a modified polygenesis. For while it assigns
to humanity a oneness of origin, in so far that its
forefathers or “Creators” were all divine beings—
though of different classes or degrees of perfection
in their hierarchy—men were nevertheless born on
seven different centres of the continent of that
period. Though all of one common origin, yet (for
reasons given) their potentialities and mental capa­
bilities, outward or physical forms, and future char­
acteristics, were different. Some superior, others
inferior, to suit the Karma of the various re­
incarnating Monads, which could not all be of the
same degree of purity in their last births in other
worlds. This accounts for the difference of races,
the inferiority of the savage, and other human varie­
ties.
The Third [Race was pre-eminently the bright
shadow, at first, of the gods, whom tradition exiles on
Earth after the allegorical war in Heaven; which
became still more allegorical on Earth, for it was
the war between spirit and matter. This war will

last till the inner and divine man adjusts his outer
terrestrial self to his own spiritual nature. Till then
the dark and fierce passions of the former will be
at eternal feud with his master, the Divine Man.
But the animal will be tamed one day, because its
nature will be changed, and harmony will reign once
more between the two as before the “Fall (268).
40. THEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH (RACES) BE­
CAME TALL WITH PRIDE. WE ARE THE KINGS,
WE ARE THE GODS (a).
41. THEY TOOK WIVES FAIR TO LOOK AT. WIVES
FROM THE “MINDLESS” THE NARROW-HEADED.
THEY BRED MONSTERS, WICKED DEMONS', MALE
AND FEMALE. ALSO KHADO (DAKINI) WITH
LITTLE MINDS (6).
42. THEY BUILT TEMPLES FOR THE HUMAN BODY.
MALE AND FEMALE THEY WORSHIPPED (c).
THEN THE THIRD EYE ACTED NO LONGER (d).
(а) Such were the first truly physical men,
whose foremost characteristic was—pride! The
Atlantean races were many, and lasted in their evolu­
tion for millions of years. All were not bad: they
became so towards their end, as -we (the Fifth Root
Race) are fast becoming now.
(б) The first war that earth knew, the first
human gore shed, was the result of man’s eyes and
senses being opened; which made him see that the
daughters of his Brethren were fairer than his own,
and their wives also. . . .This took place during
the Fourth Race, that of the giants.
(c) This is the beginning of a worship which,
ages later, was doomed to degenerate into phallicism
and sexual worship. The Lemuro-Atlantean had no
need of discovering and fixing in his memory that
which his informing P rinciple knew at the moment
of its incarnation. Time alone, and the ever-growing
1
3
9
obtuseness of the matter in which the Principles had
clothed themselves, could, the one, weaken the me­
mory of their pre-natal knowledge, the other, blunt
and even extinguish every spark of the spiritual and
divine in them. Therefore had they, from the first,
fallen victims to their animal natures and bred
“monsters”—i.e., men of distinct varieties from them­
selves.
What was the religion of the Third and Fourth
Races? In the common acceptation of the term,
neither the Lemurians, nor yet their progeny, the
Lemuro-Atlanteans, had any, as they knew no
dogma, nor had they to believe on faith. No sooner
had the mental eye of man been opened to under­
standing, than the Third Race felt itself one with
the ever-present as the ever to be unknown and in­
visible a l l the One Universal Deity. Endowed with
divine powers, and feeling in himself his inner God,
each felt he was a Man-God in his nature, though
an animal in his physical Self. The struggle between
the two began from the very day they tasted of the
fruit of the Tree of Wisdom; a struggle for life
between the spiritual and the psychic, the psychic
and the physical. Those who conquered the lower
principles by obtaining mastery over the body,
joined the “Sons of Light”. Those who fell victims
to their lower natures, became the slaves of Matter.
From “Sons of Light and Wisdom'” they ended by
becdming the “Sons of Darkness.” They had fallen
in the battle of mortal life with Life immortal, and
all those so fallen became the seed of the future
generations of Atlanteans (272).
Thus the first Atlantean races, born on the
Lemurian Continent, separated from their earliest
tribes into the righteous and the unrighteous; into
those who worshipped the one unseen Spirit of Na-
140
ture, the ray of which man feels within himself—or
the Pantheists, and. those who offered fanatical wor­
ship to the Spirits of the Earth, the dark Cosmic,
anthropomorphic Powers, with whom they made al­
liance (273). [It is evidently the descendants of the
latter who support and propagate anthropomorphic
forms of worship and belief at the present time] ....
Happily for the human race, the “Elect Race” had al­
ready become the vehicle of incarnation of the (in­
tellectually and spiritually) highest Dhyanis before
Humanity had become quite material. When the last
sub-races—
save some lowest—of the Third Race had
perished with the great Lemurian Continent, “the
seeds of the Trinity of Wisdom” had already acquired
the Secret of Immortality on Earth, that power which
enables the same great Ego to step at will from one
worn-out body into another. (276). As the Initiate
K.H. expresses it (M.L. 285) : “The Tchang-chub
(Tib. “A purified Adept,” who has, by the power of
his knowledge and soul-enlightenment become exempt
from the curse of unconscious reincarnation) may,
at his will and desire, and instead of re-incarnating
himself only after bodily death, do so, and repeated­
ly, during his life if he chooses. He holds the power
of choosing for himself new bodies—whether on this
or any other planet—while in possession of his old
form, which he generally preserves for purposes of
his own.”
Tradition whispers, what the secret teachings
affirm, namely, that these Elect were the germ of a
Hierarchy (the Trans-Himalayan Brotherhood to
which the Initiates K.H. and M. belong) which has
never died since that period:—
“The inner man of the first * * * only changes
Ms hocly from time to time; he is ever the some,
141
knowing neither rest nor Nirvana, spurning Deva-
chan* and remaining constantly on Earth for the
salvation of mankind. . . “Out of the seven virgin
men (Kumara) four sacrificed themselves for the
sins of the world and the instruction of the ignorant,
to remain till the end of the present Manvantara.
Though unseen, they are ever present. When people
say of one of them, ‘He is dead,’ Behold, he is alive
and under another form. These are the Head, the
Heart, the Soul, and the Seed of undying lcnoivledge
(Gnyana). Thou shalt never speak, 0 Lanoo, of
these great ones (Maha... .) before a multitude,
mentioning them by their names. The wise alone
ivill understand....” (Catechism of the Inner
Schools).—281. See also Stanza XI, v. 46 (&).
The possibility of the Eternal Spiritual Ego
dwelling in the unseen worlds, while its body goes on
living on Earth, is a pre-eminently Occult doctrine,
especially in Chinese and Buddhist philosophy. Many
are the soulless men among us, for it is found to take
place in wicked materialists, as well as in persons
“who advance in holiness and never turn back.” (I,
234, n. See also B.S.L. 2nd. ed. p. 62: “Incarna­
tions and Powers of the Buddha”).
(d) Concerning the Third Eye a Commentary
says:
There were four-armed human creatures in those
early days of the male-females (hermaphrodites) ;
*From the Tibetan De-wa-chen, the “World of Bliss” of
the Northern Buddhists (C.D. 456, 670) enjoyed by the im­
mortal Ego between its earthly incarnations. Actually, a sub­
jective state of consciousness.
142
%vith one head, yet three eyes. They could see before
and behind them*
A Kalpa later (after the separation of the sexes)
men having fallen into matter, their spiritual vision
became dim, and co-ordinately the Third Eye com­
menced to lose its power... .When the Fourth (Race)
arrived at its middle age, the inner vision had to he
awakened, and acquired by artificial stimuli, the pro­
cess of which was known to the old Sages, (i.e.
through Yoga training and Initiation) .. . .The Third
Eye, likewise getting gradually petrified,t soon dis­
appeared, .The double-faced became the one-faced,
and the Eye teas drawn deep into the head and is
now buried under the hair. During the activity of
the inner man (in trances and spiritual visions) the
Eye swells and expands. The Arhat sees and feels it,\
and regulates his actions accordingly. . . . The unde­
filed Lanoo (disciple) need fear no danger; he who
keeps himself not in purity (who is not chaste) will\
receive no help from the ‘deva eye’.
Again (p.296) we read: “During human life
the greatest impediment in the way of spiritual deve­
lopment, and especially to the acquirement of Yoga
powers, is the activity of our physiological senses.
Sexual action being closely connected, by interaction,
with the spinal cord and the grey matter of the brain,
it is needless to give any further explanation.
*The Third Eye was at the back of the head. The state­
ment that the latest hermaphrodite humanity was “four­
armed” unriddles probably the mystery of all the representa­
tions and idols cf the exoteric gods of India.
fThis expression “petrified” instead of “ossified” is curious.
The “back eye”, which is of course the pineal gland, now so-
called, the small pea-like mass of grey nervous matter attach­
ed to the back of the third ventricle of the brain, is said to
contain invariably nothing but mineral concretions and sand.

saurus, also showing the cavity of the third eye, was
unearthed in the lower lias rock at Harbury, Eng­
land. Its age is estimated at anything between one
and two hundred million years (see v. 44, b), but
according to the Table further on (Parallelism of
Life) a more correct figure would be about 45 million
(Secondary Age).
Modern Science on Man and Anthropoid Ape.
The eminent French anthropologist de Quatre-
fages* (1810-1892), in his Introduction a Vetude des
Races Humaines, says that “everything goes to prove
that man has not altered his physical structure one
iota since the post-Tertiary period, and even before
that time;” that “the human organism, with all its
characteristics and idiosyncrasies, existed already on
our Globe in those far distant geological periods when
there was not yet one single specimen of the now-
existing forms of mammalia.” Therefore, “since all
the human races are of one and the same species, it
follows that this species is the most ancient of all
the now living mammalia, and was already as fully
developed (physically) as it is, now when all the other
mammalia had not made even their first approach to
appearance on this Earth.”
It will be seen, therefore, that de Quatrefages
approaches very nearly to the teaching of the Secret

tural History. Differed widely from Darwin and Lamarck.

Doctrine, and is far ahead of even the boldest of his
contemporaries and immediate successors, nearly all
of whom still cling to the theory that man and the
ape have evolved from a common ancestor. But no
scientist speaks of man as "descended from the ape”,
that being merely a popular misunderstanding. In Dar­
win’s Descent of Man we read that man “is the co­
descendant with other mammals of a common pro­
genitor” (p. 607, 1875 edn.).
It is, however, important to bear in mind, in
this connection, that (according to the Secret
Doctrine) the earliest physical forms of man were
ape-like, especially in the Third Round (the previous
cycle of evolution on this Globe), and that the present
anthropoid apes are an atavistic reversion to the
Third/ Round type, due to the unnatural way in which
they were produced. As very clearly put in S.D., I,
190: “Before Man began the Fourth Round of his
evolution of Globe D (our Earth) his form had been
gradually evolving through the three previous
Rounds, until in the Third it condensed into a con­
crete physical form resembling a giant ape, sexless
and with only a nascent intelligence. The ‘Men’ of
the Third Race in the Fourth Round—ancestors of
the Atlanteans—were just such ape-like, intellectual­
ly senseless giants. Morally irresponsible, it was
these who (after separating into sexes) through pro­
miscuous connection with animal species lower than
themselves, created that “missing link” which be­
came, ages later (in the Tertiary period only) the re­
mote ancestor of the real ape as we find it now in the
pithecoid family. But this ‘man’, however much he
may have looked physically like a giant ape, was still
a thinking and already a speaking man." (Italics
mine.—B.C.).
145
Western science, having no physical data on
which to base its deductions and hypotheses, beyopd
the skulls and other remains hitherto found, naturally
cannot envisage Root Races millions of years old, still
less the far earlier development of man’s physical
form in previous cycles (Rounds) of evolution, cover­
ing the enormous period in the ancient Indian chrono­
logy of 1,664,500,990 of our years. To an Oriental,
therefore, who is familiar with the archaic calcula­
tions and records, it must seem strange to see the
speculations concerning the recently discovered “Pe­
king Man,” and the probability of his “ape-like pro­
genitors roaming the forests) of India” at a time when
the Atlantean civilisation was still flourishing. Dr.
Henry Fairfield Osborn, president of the American
Museum of Natural History, and a leading authority
on Evolution, is reported to have said in 1927:
“The Age of Man of the Pleistocene can no longer
be regarded as Act I of the prehistoric human drama,
but rather as thd final act, because at the very be­
ginning of the Pleistocene we find the human race
Well established and widely distributed over the earth.
“The prologue and the opening acts of the human
drama occurred in the upper Oligocene period. At
or before this period the family of man sprang from
a stock neither hum,an nor ape-like, but possessing
certain common attributes, which have been trans­
mitted over this very long period to variously branch­
ing races of human beings on one hand, and to vari­
ously branching races of anthropoid apes on the
other.”
The Esoteric teaching asserts, on the contrary,
that “the ape is not a product of natural evolution,
but an accident, the result of a cross-breed between
an animal being, or form, and man” (S.D. II, 262).
146
In December, 1929, however, Dr. Osborn took
up a more advanced position, bringing him nearer
to de Quatrefages and the Secret Doctrine. At the
Annual Meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, held at Des Moines, Iowa,
on Dec. 27th, he dealt with the discovery of Tertiary
Man, based on the Piltdown Dawn Man, Eoanthropus
Dawsbni. Hearing of my interest in the matter in
connection with this book, he very kindly sent me
copies of this address and also a broadcast on the
Dawn-Man given on Feb. 2nd, 1930. These reached
me just in time to use here in place of what was al­
ready in type based on more or less inaccurate press
reports. Dr. Osborn says in the broadcast that what
he is trying to do is “to substitute this new
Dawn-Man theory for the outworn Ape-Man theory”
of Lamarck and Darwin, neither of whom “knew any­
thing of the science of human palaeontology which
has since sprung up. . . . ” I select the following pas­
sages from the Des Moines address:
“As Quaternary fossil man was the central biolo­
gical contribution of the nineteenth century, so Ter­
tiary man constitutes the goal and peak of biological
discovery in the twentieth century.... Both with
Lamarck and Darwin the Ape-Man descent was never
more than a working hypothesis based upon the closer
approach of the anthropoid apes to man than that ob­
served in any other group, for want of any positive
data.
“....Certain races of fossil man of the last
1,250,000 years had a brain cube equal to or greater
than that of modern man. . . . The much despised cave
man (Palaecmthropus) was inferior to ourselves
neither in brain cube nor in hand ability... .Certain
of the cave men (Homo Sapiens, Cro-Magnon) were
CONSTANT IN FORM SINCE THE EARLIEST TIMES:
THE HUMAN HAND AS IT IS TO-DAY AND HAS
ALWAYS BEEN.
“In the embryonic human hand there is no evidence
whatever of having passed through an anthropoid ape limb-
grasping stage.”

“The Discovery ot Tertiary Man”, Dec. 1929.

147
our superiors both in average brain capacity and in
average artistic ability. . . .At the close of Tertiary
time there lived a race (Eoanbhropus Dawsoni) with
a brain cube equal to the minimum of that of the
living Veddahs, Papuans, and native Australians [de­
generate remnants of the Lemurians, according to the
S.D.—B.C.].
“The conclusion is inevitable that the main cubic
evolution of the human brain took place during ante­
cedent Tertiary time and not, as we formerly thought,
during the Quaternary Age of Man or Glacial period.
[This is interesting to compare with the S.D. teaching
that the element of Mind, as a separate and older
stream of evolution, began to inform the animal
bodies of man about the middle of the Secondary Age.
—B.C.].
“I am combating the special feature of the
Lamarck-Darwin hypothesis that man once passed
into highly specialised arboreal adaptations attained
by the Miocene apes; finally, I am inclined to separate
the human stock at a geologically earlier pre-Miocene
period of anthropoid evolution. In the geologic remote­
ness of this momentous separation of the Dawn Man
stock we are aided by a mass of collateral evidence
utterly unknown in the time of Darwin.
“Does not this unbiased survey of recent dis­
coveries in archaeology, human and comparative
palaeontology, and human and comparative anatomy,
compel us to reconsider the classic Darwin-Lamarck
hypothesis and to substitute a new hypothesis? The
new hypothesis carries us into a geologic antiquity
hitherto undreamt of. Anthropology is forced to,
share with chemistry and physics entirely new notions
of Space and Time. To my mind the human brain is
the most marvellous and mysterious object in the
148
whole universe, and no geologic period seems too long
to allow for its natural evolution.”
Compare Dr. Osborn’s last sentence (Italics
mine) with the following extract from a letter written
nearly fifty years ago by the Initiate K.H. to Mr. A.O.
Hume, founder of the Indian National Congress.:
“The human brain is an exhaustless generator
of the most refined quality of cosmic force out of the
low brute energy of Nature; and the complete Adept
has made himself a centre from which radiate poten­
tialities that beget correlations upon correlations
through /Eons of time to come. This is the key to the
mystery of his being able to project into and materia­
lize in the visible world the forms that his imagina­
tion^ has constructed out of inert cosmic matter in
the invisible world. .. .Would not this sound to one
of your ‘learned’ biologists like a madman’s dream?”
.—A Tibetan Initiate on World Problems, p. 4. See
also the remarkable letter to Hume on the voluntary
and involuntary sections of the brain, and the powers
that can be exerted by the former.—M. L. 137.
Dr. Osborn says in his broadcast that the Dawn-
Man theory first occurred to him during his journey
through the Gobi desert with Dr. Roy Chapman An­
drews in 1923, and the recent discovery of the Peking
Man has considerably strengthened the view that
man had his origin in Central Asia. His present
theory of “the ascent and phylogeny of Man”, as
shown in a genealogical tree in the Des Moines ad­
dress, assigns the Anthropoidae (common ancestors
of Man and Ape) to the Oligocene, as we have already
seen.
According to the Table “Parallelism of Life”
further on, the Fourth Root Race was then
in full development on Atlantis, whose main con-
149
tinent did not sink until the mid-Miocene; while the
Lemurian Third Race developed during the Secondary-
Age, and the Second Race in the Primary, in Nor­
thern Asia, the Hyperborean Continent. But a gocd
deal depends on how long the Gobi was a sea. We are
informed (608) that, after the sinking of Atlantis,
“even the high table-lands of what is now Tibet be­
came submerged for a time. When geology shall have
found out how many thousands of years ago the dis­
turbed waters of the Indian Ocesjn reached the highest
plateaux of Central Asia, when the Caspian Sea and
the Persian Gulf made one with it, then only will
they know the age of the Aryan Brahmanical nation,
and the time of its descent into the plains of Hin­
dustan, which it did millenniums later.”
Again, at p. 776: “The whole globe is convulsed
periodically; and has been so convulsed, since the ap­
pearance of the First Root Race, four times. Yet,
though the whole face of the Earth was transformed
thereby each time, the conformation of the Arctic
and Antarctic Poles has but little altered. The polar
lands unite and break off from each other into islands
and peninsulas, yet remain ever the same. Therefore
Northern Asia is called the ‘Eternal or Perpetual
Land,” and the Antarctic the “ever living” and “the
concealed”; while the Mediterranean, Atlantic, Paci­
fic, and other regions, disappear and reappear in turn,
into and above the great waters.”
In, 1912 Professor Duckworth, of Cambridge
University, Eng., wrote:
“The years that have elapsed since the commence­
ment of the Oligocene period must be numbered by
millions (See Table). The human type would be
shown thus (if it existed then) not merely to have
150
survived the Mastodon, Hipparion and Deinotherium,
but to have witnessed their evolution and the parental
forms from which they arose.”— Prehistoric Man.
This is precisely what ancient records say he did
and also much earlier forms of life in the Reptilian
Secondary Age, since it maintains that “Man, or
rather that which becomes man, passes through all
the forms and kingdoms during the first Round tof
evolution on our present globe—the fourth in the
series of seven] and through all the human shapes
during the two following Rounds. Arrived on our
Earth at the commencement of the Fourth Round, in
the present series of life-cycles and races, Man is the|
first form that appears thereon, being preceded only
by the mineral and vegetable kingdoms—even the
latter having to develope and continue its further
evolution through Man. During the three Rounds to
come, Humanity, like the globe on which it lives, will
ever be tending to re-assume its primeval form, that
of a Dhyan-Chohanic Host. Man tends to become a
God and then G od, like every other atom in the Uni­
verse” (Ir-irot). . . . “Having appeared at the very
beginning, and at the head of sentient and conscious
life, Man| became the living and animal Unit, from
which the ‘cast-off clothes’ determined the shape of
every life and animal in this Round. Thus he ‘creat­
ed’ for ages the insects, reptiles, birds, and animals,
unconsciously to himself, from his remains and relics
from the Third and Fourth Rounds” (IJlSd).
In the Comparative Table which follows it will
be seen how the great Root Races correspond to the
geological periods and the Brahmin Chronology (q.v.
Stanza III. v. 13 a.).
It is based on those given in S.D. II, 709, et seq.,
under the heading of “Esoteric Geological Chrono­
151
logy.” In the first column are the five main periods
into which Science divides the history of the Globe
since the beginning of life (Azoic Age), according
to Haeckel. Esoteric Philosophy divides the Man-
vantara (cycle of Manifestation) into Seven Kalpas
(Cycles) and Seven Root Races. Its first Kalpa is
the period answering to the Scientific Primordial
Epoch. The Root Races and their sub-divisions, their
chief features and modifications, are placed opposite
the geological periods in which they occurred, as near­
ly as can be judged. In the right-hand column under
“Various Estimates” are given (opposite the periods
and Races to which they relate) the Esoteric, Brah­
min, and Modern Scientific Estimates. In each of the
Geological Ages are given the principal Fauna and
Flora assigned to them by Science, according to the
fossil remains found in those strata. Science, as we
have seen above, has yet to discover actual human re­
mains in the early Tertiary deposits, although the
Eolithic implements are thought by some to indicate
his presence in the Oligocene period.

CIVILIZATION AND DESTRUCTION OF
THE THIRD AND FOURTH RACES.*
(43) The Lemuro-Atlanteans build cities and spread
civilisation. The incipient stage of Anthropomorphism. (44).
Their statues, witnesses to the size of the Lemuro-Atlanteans.
(45) Lemuria destroyed by fire, Atlantis by water. The Flood.
(46) The destruction of the Fourth Race and of the last
antediluvian monster-animals.

RARE EARTHS AND METALS THEY BUILT. OUT
OF THE FIRES (LAVA) VOMITED. OUT OF THE
WHITE STONE OF THE MOUNTAINS (MARBLE)
AND THE BLACK STONE (OF THE SUBTER­
RANEAN FIRES) THEY CUT THEIR, OWN IMAGES,
IN THEIR SIZE AND LIKENESS, AND WOR­
SHIPPED THEM (a).
(a) As the History of the first two human
races—the last of the Lemurians and the first of the
future Atlanteans—proceeds, we have at this point
to blend the two, and speak of them for a time col­
lectively. Here reference is also made to the Divine
Dynasties, such as were claimed by the Egyptians,
Chaldeans, Greeks, etc., to have preceded their human
kings; they are still believed in by the modern Hindus,
and are enumerated in their sacred books.
What remains to be shown is, that our modern
geologists are now being driven into admitting the
evident existence of submerged continents. But to
confess their presence is not to accept that there were
*The original reads “Fourth and Fifth Races,” but as
those destroyed were the Third and Fourth, it is evidently a
slip which I have ventured to correct.—B. C.

155
men on them during the early geological periods; aye,
men and civilised nations, not Palaeolithic savages
only; who, under the guidance of their Divine Rulers,
built large cities, cultivated arts and sciences, and
knew astronomy, architecture and mathematics to
perfection. This primeval civilisation did not, as one
may think, immediately follow their physiological
transformation. Between the final evolution and the
first city built, many hundreds of thousands of years
had passed. Yet we find thej Lemurians in their sixth
sub-race building their first rock-cities out of stone and
lava. One of such great cities of primitive structure
was built entirely of lava, some thirty miles west of
Easter Island [itself, with its gigantic statues, a
speaking witness to Lemuria and its civilisation].*
*H.F.B. suggests here that Rider Haggard’s novel She
was the result of “a retrospective clairvoyant dream. His im­
perial Kor, the great city of the dead, whose surviving living
men sailed northwards after the plague had killed almost a
whole nation, seems to step in its general outlines from the
imperishable pages of the Archaic Records. Ayesha suggests
‘that those men who sailed north may have been the fathers
of the first Egyptians’; and then seems to attempt a synopsis
of certain letters1 of a Master [The Initiate K.H. whom I
quote ante and post.—B. C.] cited in A.P. Sinnett’s Esoteric
Buddhism. For, she says, ‘Time after time have nations, aye,
and rich and strong nations, learned in the arts, lived, and
passed away, and been forgotten, so that no memory of them
remains. This (the nation of Kor) is but one of several; for
time eats up the work of man unless, indeed, he digs in caves
like the people of Kor, and then mayhap the sea swalloivs them,
or the earthquake shakes them in. . .Y e t were these people
not utterly destroyed, as I think’ (p. 180). Here the clever
novelist seems to repeat the history of all the now degraded
and downfallen races of humanity.” [H.P.B. also says that “no
grander psychological esssay on Occult lines exists than Robert
[Louis Stevenson’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.” When it appeared
she wrote and asked him how he got hold of such a pro­
found Occult truth about the dual nature of man. He replied
that he got it in a dream. I remember that the late W. T.
Stead, in an article on Stevenson, put it thus: “His ‘brownies’,
in a vision of the night, showed him the picture of a man who
wag two men, and he wrote Jekyll and Hyde.”—B. C.]
156
The oldest remains of Cyclopean buildings were all
the handiwork; of the Lemurians of the last sub-races.
The first large cities, however, appeared on that re­
gion of the continent now known as the island of
Madagascar. There were civilised people and savages
in those days as there are now. Evolution achieved
its work of perfection with the former, and Karma
—
its work of destruction on the latter. The Australians
[flat-headed aborigines] and their like are the descend­
ants of those, who, instead of vivifying the ‘spark’
dropped into them by the “Flames,” extinguished it
by long generations of animalism.
Nevertheless, and civilisation notwithstanding,
while their pastoral brethren enjoyed wondrous pow­
ers as their birthright, they, the builders, could now
obtain theirs only gradually; even these being gen­
erally used for power over physical nature, and sel­
fish and unholy purposes. Civilisation has ever develop­
ed the physical and intellectual at the cost of the
psychic and spiritual.. The command and the guid­
ance over his own psychic nature, which foolish men
now associate with the supernatural, were with early
Humanity innate and congenital, and came to man as
naturally as walking and thinking (319).
Gradually mankind went down in stature, for,
even before the real advent of the Fourth or Atlan-
tean race, the majority of mankind had fallen into
iniquity and sin, save the hierarchy of the “Elect,”
the followers and disciples of the “Sons of Will and
Yoga,” called later the “Sons of the Fire Mist.”
Commentary xxxiii tells us that after the Lemu-
rian cataclysm, not only stature but duration of life
diminished. “Having fallen down in godliness, they
mixed with animal races, and intermarried among
giants and pygmies (the dwarfed races of the Poles)

Thus were the Atlanteans approaching destruc­

took to accomplish this fourth destruction is indicated
in the Table “Parallelism of life.”

(a) The great rock-hewn statues at Bamian,
between Kabul and Balkh, are an imperishable record
of the Esoteric Teaching about the gradual evolu­
tion of the Races. They are the handiwork of the
Initiates of the Fourth Race who sought refuge, after
the submersion of Atlantis, in the fastnesses and on
the summits of the Central Asian mountain chains.
The largest statue—173ft.—is made to represent
the First Race of mankind, its ethereal body being
commemorated in hard, everlasting stone, for the
instruction of future generations, as its remembrance
would otherwise never have survived the Atlantean
Deluge.
The second—120ft. high—represents the Sweat-
Born; and the third—measuring about 6f>ft.—im­
mortalizes the race that fell, and thereby inaugurated
the first physical race, born of father and mother.

158
We are told that it was after the destruc­
tion of Lemuria by subterranean fires that men went
on steadily decreasing in stature—a process already
begun after their physical Fall—and that finally,
some millions of years after, they reached between
six and seven feet, and are now dwindling down (as
the older Asiatic races) to nearer five than six feet-
As Pickering shows, there is in the Malay race (a
sub-race of the Fourth Root Race) a singular diver­
sity of stature; the members of the Polynesian
family (Tahitians, Samoans, and Tonga islanders)
are of a higher stature than the rest of mankind; but
the Indian tribes and the inhabitants of the Indo-
Chinese countries are decidedly below the general
average. This is easily explained. The Polynesians
belong to the very earliest of the surviving sub-races,
the others to the very last and transitory stock. As
the Tasmanians are now completely extinct, and the
Australians rapidly dying out, so will the other old
races soon follow.
(6) Now, how could those records have been
preserved?—we may be asked. While the Egyptians
have on their Zodiacs irrefutable proofs of records
having embraced more than three and a half Sidereal
Years—
or about 87,000 of our years—the Hindu cal­
culations cover nearly thirty-three Sidereal or 850,
000 of our years; i.e., they possess recorded observa­
tions from the date of the First Great Flood within
Aryan historical memory—that which submerged the
last portions [Ruta and Daitya] of the main continent
of Atlantis. Plato’s island Poseidonis, which sank
about 11,000 years ago, was only a last fragment.
The sinking and transformation of Lemuria, ages
previous to the above, beginning nearly at the Arctic
Circle (Norway), the Third [Root] Race ended its
career in Lanka, or rather that which became Lanka

as Ceylon is the Northern highland of ancient Lanka,
while the enormous island of that name was, in the
Lemurian period, the gigantic continent which not
only embraced a vast area in the Pacific and Indian
Oceans, but extended in the shape of a horseshoe past
Madagascar, round South Africa (then a mere frag­
ment in process of formation) through the Atlantic
up to Norway. The English Wealden is the bed of
the main stream which drained Northern Lemuria in
the Secondary Age.
The complete records of the growth, development,
social, and even political life of the Lemurians, have
been preserved in the secret annals. Unfortunately,
few are those who can read them; and those who
could would still be unable to understand the language,
unless acquainted with all the seven keys of its
symbolism (334).
For the comprehension of the Occult Doctrine
is based on that of the seven sciences; which sciences
find their expression in the seven different applica­
tions of the secret records to the exoteric texts. The
mode of thought in which they were originally writ­
ten has to be found out and closely adhered to during 1
the process of interpretation. For it is either (1)
Symbolical: Archaic mode of thought; (2) Emblema­
tical: a later though very ancient mode of thought;
(3) Parabolical: Parable, which has three features:;
(a) It is always spiritual* (b) It is limited to na­
tural probability; (c) It enforces a single lesson; (4)
Hieroglyphical; or (5) Logogrammical: the most dif­
ficult method of all, because every letter—as in Chin­
ese—represents a whole word. Thus, almost every
proper name, whether in the Vedas, the Book of the,
Dead [so-called; it being really a Book of Initiation},
160
or the Bible (to a degree) is composed of such
logograms.
No one who is not initiated into the mystery of
the Occult religious Logography, can presume to'
know what a name in any ancient fragment means,,
before he has mastered the meaning of every letter
that composes it. Thus, Vaivasvata, Xisuthrus,
Deukalion, Noah, etc.,—all the head-figures of the
world-deluges, universal and partial, astronomical or
geological—furnish in their very names the records
of the causes and effects which led to the event, if
one can but read them fully.
45. THE FIRST GREAT WATERS CAME. THEY
SWALLOWED THE SEVEN GREAT ISLANDS (a).
46. ALL HOLY SAVED, THE UNHOLY DESTROYED.
WITH THEM MOST OF THE HUGE ANIMALS
PRODUCED FROM THE SWEAT OF THE EARTH
( 6 ) .
(a) The seven great islands (Dwipas) belonged
to the continent of Atlantis. The Fifth Race (our
own) was then in its infancy.
(b) Thus the giants perished; but that only
“the unholy” were destroyed was due as much to the
prevision of the “holy” ones who had not lost the use
of their Third Eye, as to Karma and natural law.
Speaking of the subsequent Race (our Fifth Human­
ity) the Commentary says:—
“Alone the handful of those Elect, whose divine
instructors had gone, to inhabit that Sacred Island
[Sham-bha-la]—from whence the last Saviour will
come— now kept mankind from becoming one-half the
exterminator of the other (as mankind does now.—-
H.P.B.). It (mankind) became divided. Two-thirds of
it were ruled by Dynasties of lower, material Spirits
of the earth, who took possession of the easily acces-

sible bodies; one-third remained faithful, and joined
with the nascent Fifth Race—the divine Incarnates.
When the Poles moved (for the fourth time) this did
not affect those who were protected, and who had
■separated from the Fourth Race. Like the Lemurians
— alone the ungodly Atlanteans perished, and ‘were
seen no more’. . .”
The “Sons of Will and Yoga" and the
“Sacred Island".
Sham-bha-la (Tib. De-jung) is the name associat­
ed alike in tradition and the Book off Dzyan with the
■
“Abode of the Brothers” (Tib. Bhante Yul, the syllable
Bha denoting “a Bodhisattva or Mahasattva who is
capable of carrying heavy moral responsibilities” ; C.
D. 861). It is now a concealed oasis believed to be in
the north-west of Tibet, but was originally the “Sacr­
ed Island” when a great inland sea extended over
middle Asia. When the Atlantean cataclysm occurred,
•as related further on, the “Sons of Will and Yoga,”
who with a few tribes survived, it, took refuge on
that island, as they had done after the Lemurian
cataclysm. The hierophants of all the Sacerdotal
■Colleges were aware of its existence, but the “lost
Word” guarded there was known only to the Java
Aleim (the Maha Chohan of the Secret Fraternity
spoken of in M.L. 325, 400, 406) the Head or Grand
Master of every college, andi was passed to his suc­
cessor only at the moment of death. There was no
communication with the fair island,
,by sea, but sub­
terranean passages, known only to the chiefs, com­
municated with it in all directions, as in ancient cities,
caves and temples in India and elsewhere.
In Peking, where I write this, one frequently
hears echoes of this age-old tradition from travellers
162
who have been in the Gobi and Mongolia. In Ossen-
dowski’s Beasts, Men and Gods it takes the form of
the mysterious subterranean kingdom of Agharti
ruled by the “King of the World” which is only an­
other name for the Maha Chohan. The first syllable
of Sham-bha-la is the Chinese word Shamo which
means “desert.” In Asiatic Buddhism it is identical
with the Western Hieaven of Amida Buddha or
Amitabha where dwells the Coming Buddha Maitreya
from whom Aryasangha, founder of the esoteric
Yogachdrya school (Tib. Naljor Cho-pa) derived his
knowledge, receiving the five books of Maitreya’s
teaching* (Tib. Chamba Cho-pa) in verse. H.P.B., in
her Letters to Sinnett (195) says that there is a secret
version in prose from which she made quotations, as
well as from the Book of Dzyan, in the S.D.
In the Esoteric teachings Sham-bha-la is a real
locality described as being “in a desert within
mountains.” and a Commentary says that Mother
Earth’s Heart “beats under the foot of the sacred:
Sham-bha-la, which then (in the beginning) was not
yet born. For it is in the Belt (mountain chain) of
man’s dwelling (Earth) that lies concealed the life
and health of all that lives and breathes” [i.e. the
electro-magnetic current which is her life-blood].
Another point of significance is, that in the
Hierarchy of Tashi Lamas inaugurated by the Yellow-
Cap Reformer Tsong-Kha-pa, representing continuous
incarnations of Amitabha, the third of that line, Pan-
chen Paldan Yeshe (1738-1780) wrote a book entitled
A Journey to Sham-bha-la (C. D. 1231).

(a) This verse relates to the Fifth Race. His­
tory does not begin with it, but living and ever-recur­
ring tradition does. History—or what is called his­
tory—does not go further back than the fantastic
•origins of our fifth sub-race, a “few thousands” of
years. It is the sub-divisions of this sub-race of the
Fifth Root-Race which are referred to in the
sentence: “Some yellow, some brown and black, and
some red, remained.”
163
164
But the “Serpents of Wisdom” have preserved'
their records well, and the history of the human evolu­
tion is traced in heaven as it is traced on under­
ground walls. Humanity and the stars are bound
together indissolubly, because of the intelligences
that rule the latter.
(b) The Commentary says:—“The Great
v Dragon has respect hut for the ‘Serpents’ of
Wisdom, the Serpents whose holes are now under the
triangular stones,” (i.e., “the Pyramids, at the four
corners of the world.”) This tells us clearly that
which is mentioned more than once elsewhere in the
Commentaries, namely, that the Adepts or “Wise”-
men of the three Races (the Third, Fourth, and Fifth)
dwelt in subterranean habitats, generally under some
kind of pyramidal structure, if not actually under a
pyramid. For such “pyramids” existed in the “four
corners of the world” and were never the monopoly
of the land of the Pharaohs, as was supposed until
they were found scattered all over the two
Americas.
The Serpent or Dragon has ever been the symbol
of the Adept, and of his powers of immortality and
divine knowledge. The Chinese,__one of the oldest
nations of our Fifth Race, made of it the emblem of
their Emperors, who were thus the degenerate suc­
cessors of the “Serpents” or Initiate^ who ruled the
early races of the Fifth Humanity. The Emperor’s
throne was the “Dragon’s Seat”, and his robes of
State were embroidered with the likeness of the
Dragon. The aphorisms in the oldest books of
China, moreover, say plainly that the Dragon is a
human, albeit divine, Being.
Nearly five hundred years before the Christian
era, Herodotus was shown by the priests of Egypt the
statues of their super-human Kings and Pontiffs-
165
piromis (the arch-prophets' or Maha-Chohans of the
temples) born one from the other (without the in­
tervention of woman) who had reigned before Menes.
[The same ideal is preserved in Tibet to this
day, where the Hierarchy of the Tashi Lamas insti­
tuted by Tsong-Kha-pa (an incarnation of the Buddha
in the 14th century) is'a succession of incarnations
of the same high Being.]
The ancient Chinese Book of Changes or Per­
mutations (I Ching) attributes the discovery of agri­
culture to “the instruction given to men by celestial
genii.” [Unfortunately the dawn of the present cen­
tury saw China in the throes of revolution. The
Dragon Throne stands empty, the temples are falling
into ruins, most of the old monuments are neglected
and in decay, and frequent civil wars continue to op­
press and impoverish the people. Following the ex­
ample of Soviet Russia, interference with Buddhist
and other temples began in 1929, on the usual plea
of “suppressing superstition”, and the result may be,
in both those great countries, an entirely materialis­
tic State, which m,ust inevitably share the fate of
those earlier civilisations whose downward course is
traced in the Stanzas we have been studying.
Japan, on the other hand, like Tibet, has pre­
served the ancient ideal of the Priest-King, for it is
believed that the dynasty is descended in an un­
broken line from a primeval divine pair. The Em­
peror is both a Priest-King and a constitutional sover­
eign. In the former capacity he appears before the
ancestors of the nation at the thirteen major Imperial
festivals, praying and making offerings both to them
and to the gods on behalf of the people. These rites
furnish the key to the unique position of the Japanese
Imperial House, and they show that the bond is re­
ligious as well as political. This reverence for
166
ancestors which is a leading feature of Shinto, the
State religion,- has outlasted the vicissitudes of two
millenniums, and is common to all Japanese and
most Chinese. The cosmogony of Shinto is similar
in many respects to that of the Secret Doctrine, as
is that of Taoism in China. In both countries
Buddhism and Confucianism exist in harmony with
those systems. As their proverbs say: In his youth
a man attends a Shinto shrine, his maturity is re­
gulated by the Confucian moral code, and in his old
age he takes to the study of Buddhism when he
enquires into the mysteries of life and the universe.]
The Japan Advertiser, of Tokyo, in a survey in
1929, pertinently remarks: “One of the unforeseen
effects of the impact of Christianity is the rejuvena­
tion of Buddhism. Under the stimulus of the rival
from overseas, the Buddhist sects have developed
remarkable activity, the educational and spiritual
standards of the priesthood have been raised, and
beginnings have been made with the charitable works
which Christianity enjoins on its followers.”
In giving some additional fragments from a
Commentary on Stanza XII, H.P.B. says they are
taken from the Records of the “Thirty-Five Buddhas
of Confession” (Tib. Thb-sha Sangye So-nga; lit.
“Confession Buddhas Thirty-five”) as they are
exoterically called. These personages, however,
though called in the Northern Buddhist religion
“Buddhas”, may just as well be called Rishis or
Avatars, etc., as they are “Buddhas who have preced­
ed Sakyamuni” according to the teaching of the
Northern followers of the ethics preached by
Gautama. These great Mahatmas, or Buddhas, are
a universal and common property: they are historical
sages—at any rate for all the Occultists who be­
lieve in such a hierarchy of Sages, the existence of
167
which has been proved to them by the learned ones
of the Fraternity.
Of these great Adepts and Saints in whom the
“Sons of Wisdom” had incarnated, eleven only belong­
ed to the Atlantean race, and twenty-four to the
Fifth race from its beginnings. They are identical
with the Tirtankaras of the Jains. One of them,
from whose tablets the fragments are taken, is said
to have witnessed the Deluge and the submersion of
the chief continents of the Atlantean race. The day
when much, if not all, of that which is given here
from the Archaic Records, will be found correct, is
not far distant. (423).
Aeroplanes Used by the Atlanteans.
It is from the Fourth Race that the early Aryans
got their knowledge.... of Viwan Vidya (the “know­
ledge of flying in air-vehicles”), and, therefore, their
great arts of meteorography and meteorology.*
The terrible sidereal force called by them M a s h -M a k ,
and by the Aryan Rishis in the Ashtar Vidya (the
most ancient Hindu work on Magic) by a name we
do not like to give, is the Vril of Bulwer Lytton’s The
Coming Race, and of the coming races of our man­
kind. The name Vril may be a fiction; the Force it­
self is a fact doubted as little in India as the existence
itself of their Rishis, since it is mentioned in all the
secret works.
It is this vibratory Force, which, when aimed at
an army from an Agni Rath (“Fiery Vehicle”, a
*The modern meteorograph consists of a barograph,
thermograph and hydrograph, and was originally attached to
kites and test balloons for recording fluctuations in pressure,
temperature, and humidity respectively. Modern Meteorology
began in 1337, and investigates all the conditions of the
atmosphere. It has become of great importance in connec­
tion with aviation.
168
kind of flying machine), according to the instructions
in Ashtar Vidya, reduced to ashes 100,000 men and
elephants, as easily as it would a dead rat. It is
allegorised in the Vishnu Purdna, in the Ramayana
and other works, in the fable about the Sage “Kapila
whose glance made a mountain of ashes of King
Sagara’s 60,000 sons”, and which is explained in the
m-fes esoteric works and referred to as the Kapilaksha
—“Kapila’s Eye.”
It is evidently this Force which is referred to by
the Initiate K.H. (M.L. 140) : “There is a force
as limitless as thought, as potent as boundless will, as
subtle as the essence of life, so inconceivably awful
in its rending power as to convulse the Universe to
its centre, would it but be used as a lever; but this
Force is not God, since there are men who have
learned the secret of subjecting it to their will when
necessary.”
With even the lower aspects of such a Force at their
command, the Atlanteans and early Aryans would
have no need of the relatively clumsy and unreliable
mechanical contrivances we have to use in aeronautics
which still lead so often to “crashes” and other dis­
asters. Bear in mind what was said in the Preface
concerning the discoveries which are confirming the
Secret Doctrine, written in 1888 before even the in­
ternal combustion motor had made the modern
aeroplane possible. H.P.B., discussing Keely’s inter-
etheric Force” in connection with the above (I. 563)
explains that he was “not allowed to pass a certain
limit because he had unconsciously discovered” the
secret of Ma sh -mak, and could not be permitted to
commercialise it. Therefore the attempt failed and he
was made to appear a charlatan. “And is it this
Satanic Force”, she asks, “that our generations were
to be allowed to add to their stock of Anarchist’s
169
baby-toys. ... which would reduce Europe in a few
days to its primitive chaotic state with no man left
alive to tell the tale—Is this Force to become the com­
mon property of all men alike?”
Only forty years later we find ourselves at a
point in scientific development which is bringing'
within measurable distance such a disaster, repeating
history as related in the Archaic Records. In the
New York Times Magazine, June 30, 1929, Mr. T. J.
C. Martyn writes:
“The imagination leaps forward to picture the
war of the future, and we recoil in horror at what
science reveals.... Electricity, we know, is composed
of electrons, which are an infinitesimal component of
and far smaller than the atoms. If the atom could bel
disintegrated and its electrons reassembled, the pro­
cess would involve a release of energy which, accord­
ing to many eminent scientists, might destroy the
whole world and perhaps even the Solar System.”
This is just what Keely was stopped from attempting
to do, for he wrote: “Sound, truly defined, is the dis­
turbance of atomic equilibrium, rupturing actual
atomic corpuscles; and the substance thus liberated
must certainly be a certain order of etheric flow.”
This is true in Esoteric teaching. Mr. Martyn con­
tinues : “We can direct an airplane in flight by radio
and gyroscopic control, a method that will doubtless
undergo many refinements and so increase in
efficiency. . . .But this leaves out of the question.the
radio waves themselves. . . . If we can send a power-,
ful charge through space, we have, in effect, the
‘Death Ray’, about which there has been so much
fiction written, and with which inventors the world
over have been busy. It would be possible to send
this power over enormous distances, in wide belts,
and every human being in its field would be instantly
170
electrocuted, unless some method of insulation were
found: The method is already worked out on paper,
we are told, and when put into action, it will repeat
to some extent what the Atlanteans could do with
the Viwans and Ma sh -Ma k . A s Mr. Martyn truly
says:
“The horrors of Dante would be the delights of
Pan in comparison. The whole world would be an­
other Sodom and Gomorrah, only infinitely more
terrible, infinitely more appalling.”
After reading the foregoing, the following frag­
ments from, the ancient Records, telling the story of
the drowning of the Atlantean sorcerers, despite their
air-vehicles and magic arts, will be better understood
(II, 427) :
... .And the “great King of the dazzling Face,”
■the chief of all the Yellow-faced, was sad, seeing the
sins of the Black-faced.
... .He sent his air-vehicles (Viwan) to all his bro­
ther-chiefs (of other nations and tribes) vjith pious
men within, saying: ‘Prepare. .Arise ye men of the
Good Law, and cross the land while (yet) dry.’
‘The Lords of the storm are approaching. Their
chariots are nearing the land. One night and two
days only shall the Lords of the Dark Face (the
Sorcerers) live on this patient land. She is doomed,
and they have to descend with her. The nether Lords
of the Fires (the Gnomes and fire Elementals) are
preparing their magic Agniyastra* (fire-weapons
worked by magic). But the Lords of the Dark Eye
(“Evil Eye”) are stronger than they (the Elementals)'
and they are the slaves of the mighty ones. They
are versed in Ashtar Vidya (the highest magical

I
knowledge). Come and use yours (i.e. your magic
powers, in order to counteract those of the Sorcer­
ers) .
. .. .Let every Lord of the Dazzling Face (Adept
of White Magic) cause the Viwan of every Lord of
the Dark Face to come into his hands, lest any (of
the Sorcerers) should by its means escape from the
waters... .May every Yellow Face send sleep from
himself (mesmerize?) to every Black Face. May even
they (the Sorcerers) avoid pain and suffering. May
every man true to the Solar Gods bind (paralyze)
every man under the lunar gods, lest he should suffer
or escape his destiny.
‘And may every Yellow Face offer his life-water
(blood) to the speaking animal of a Black Face, lest
he awaken his master (An artificial creature which
warned its master of danger),
‘Let their destiny be accomplishedWe are the
servants of the great Four (Karmic deities). May
the Kings of Light return”....
When the Kings assembled the waters had al­
ready moved. ... 1
(But) the nations had now crossed the dry lands.
They were beyond the water mark. Their Kings
reached them in their Viwans, and led them on to the
lands of Fire and Metal (East and North) . . i .
When the Lords of the Dark Face awoke and
bethought themselves of their Viwans in order to
escape the rising waters, they found them gone.
The account goes on to say that some of the
more powerful of the Dark Face awoke earlier than
the others and pursued those who were escaping “led
by the Sons of Wisdom” ; but they were overcome by
the rising waters, and finally perished to the last
man.

The “Curse” from a Philosophical Point of View.
One of the finest sections that follow the com­
ments on the Stanzas is that which disposes of “that
most pernicious of all the theological dogmas—the
Curse, under which mankind is alleged to have suffer­
ed ever since the supposed disobedience of Adam and
Eve in the bower of Eden.” (II, 409).
Here we are brought back to the problem of Sex
referred to in the comments on Stanza X, The H is­
tory of the F ourth Race; and we are told “the
Curse of Karma was not called down on them for
seeking natural union, as all the mindless animal
world does in its proper seasons; but for abusing
the creative power, for desecrating the divine gift,
and wasting the life-essence for no purpose except
personal animal gratification. Thus the whole nature
of the Fourth Race was gradually changed, physical­
ly, morally and mentally, until, from the healthy
King of animal creation of the Third Race, man be­
came in our Fifth, a helpless scrofulous being, and
has now become the wealthiest heir on the globe to
constitutional and hereditary diseases, the most con­
sciously and intelligently sensual of all animals!”*
*The leading British gynaecologists have become seri­
ously alarmed at the great increase of certain diseases
among women, particularly a dread form of cancer, alleged
to have followed the growing prevalence of Birth Control.
In a report issued in January, 1930, they say: “The con­
troversy has far-reaching religious, moral, economic and
social, as well as medical, aspects. . . . As medical men we
intend, however, merely to present medical facts on which
the authorities, looking at the matter from the wider national
and racial angle, may act with confidence, as they acted with
vigour in suppressing certain practices which, in some in­
dustrial areas, were widespread long before the knowledge
of Birth Control methods became almost universal.”
Dr. Henry Corby, Professor of Gynaecology, University
College, Cork, Ireland, in The Practitioner, No. 661 (Special
173
“This is the real CURSE from the physiological
standpoint, almost the only one touched upon in the
Kabalistic esotericism. The intellectual evolution has
certainly been a curse instead of a blessing—a gift
quickened by the ‘Lords of Wisdom’, who have poured
on the human Manas the fresh dew of their own
spirit and essence.”
H.P.B. then proceeds to analyse the Prometheus
Bound, written by that great Initiate of the Sabasian
Mysteries, iEschylus, as the “drama enacted daily
within our actual mankind. The lower passions chain
the higher aspirations to the rock of matter, to
generate in many a case the Vulture of sorrow, pain
and repentance”—that Vulture depicted as gnawing
at the vitals of the divine crucified Titan. Prome­
theus, out of pity for the blind race of mortals, con­
fers on them the “mystery of the creative fire” which
he had stolen from the gods:
Prometheus : Yea, and besides ‘twas I that gave them
fire.
Number on Contraception) declares that venereal disease is
practically nil in Irish country districts and very little in
Cork; and that Irish children are the healthiest in Europe,
largely owing to “eontraeoncepts being unknown to the Irish
poor.” Summing up, he says: “Contraeoncepts undoubted­
ly tend to produce ill-health in both husband and wife. . . .
If the advocates of these self-limiting practices are successful
in making them at all widespread, the land will be cumbered
by a weakly, degenerated race of neurasthenics and hypo­
chondriacs, not a small percentage of whom will drift into
lunatic asylums-----Nature is a stern goddess, who relent­
lessly punishes those who set at naught her beneficent or­
dinances.” Dr. Louise Mellroy, lady Gynaecologist of the
University of London, writes in the same issue: “The me­
dical profession can no longer shirk their moral responsibili­
ties in dealing with the present harmful results of birth con­
trol.” Other contributors voice similar views from various
angles.
174
Chorus: Have now these short-lived creatures flame­
eyed fire?
Prom.: Aye, and by it full many arts will learn.
But, with the arts, the “fire” received has turn­
ed into the greatest curse: the animal element, and
consciousness of its possession, has changed periodical
instinct into chronic animalism and sensuality. It is
this which hangs over humanity like a heavy funeral
pall.
The Promethean myth is a prophecy indeed; but
it does not relate to any of the cyclic Saviours who
have appeared periodically in various countries
and among various nations.... It points to the last
of the mysteries of cyclic transformations, in the
series of which mankind, having passed from the
ethereal to the solid physical state, from spiritual
to physiological procreation, is now carried onward
on the opposite arc of the cycle, towT
ard that second
phase of its primitive state, when woman knew no
man, and human progeny was created, not begotten.
That state will return to it and to the world
at large, when the latter shall discover and really
appreciate the truths which underlie this vast pro­
blem of sex.... Then, as one of the great Initiates
(K. H.) once wrote to a student: “the world will have
a race of Buddhas and Christs, for the world will have
discovered that individuals have it in their own 'powers
to .procreate Buddha-like children— or demons.”
“When that knowledge comes, all dogmatic religions,
and with these the demons, will die out” (415).
/Eschylus did not invent the prophecy of Pro­
metheus (Gk. He who foresees), but only repeated in
dramatic form that which was revealed by the priests
during the Mysteria of the Sabasia—a variant on
the Mithraic Mysteries in which the whole Evolution
1
7
5
of the Races, as here summarised in the Stanzas, was
enacted.
It was not in the programme of natural develop­
ment that Man—higher animal though he may be—•
should become at once—intellectually, spiritually, and
psychically—the demi-god he is on earth, while his
physical frame remains weaker and more helpless
and ephemeral than that of almost any huge mammal.
The contrast is too grotesque and violent.
The gift of Prometheus thus became a CURSE— •
though foreknown and foreseen by the H ost per­
sonified in the Divine Titan, as his name shows. It
is in this that rests, at one and the same time, its
sin and its redemption. For the Host that incarnat­
ed in a portion of humanity [see Stanza VII], though
led to it by Karma or Nemesis, preferred free-will
to passive slavery—intellectual self-conscious pain and
even torture “whi’e myriad time shall flow”—to inane,
imbecile, instinctual beatitude.
Knowing that such an incarnation was prema­
ture and not in nature’s plan, the Heavenly Host
“Prometheus” still sacrificed itself to benefit thereby
at least one portion of mankind. But, while saving
man from mental darkness, they inflicted upon him
the tortures of self-consciousness of his responsibility
—the result of his free-will—besides every ill to
which mortal man and flesh are heir.
This torture Prometheus accepted for himself,
since the Host became henceforward blended with
the tabernacle prepared for them, which was still
unachieved at that period of formation.
Spiritual evolution being incapable of keeping
pace with the physical., once its homogeneity was
broken by the admixture, the gift thus became the
chief cause, if not the sole origin, of Evil. (421).
176
Since the beginning of the Atlantean Race many
million's of years have passed, yet we find the last
of the Atlanteans still mixed up with the Aryan ele­
ment 11,000 years ago. This shows the enormous
overlapping of one race over the race that succeeds
it, though in character and external type the elder
loses its characteristics and assumes the new
features of the younger race. This is proved in all
the formations of mixed human races. Esoteric
philosophy teaches that even now, under our very
eyes, the new Race and Races are preparing to be
formed, and that it is in America that the transfor­
mation will take place, and has already silently com­
menced. ,
The Americans have become in only three cen­
turies a “primary race”, pro tem., before becoming
a race apart, and strongly separated from all other
existing races. They are, in short, the germs of
the Sixth sub-race and in some few hundred years
more will become most decidedly the pioneers of that
race which must succeed to the present European
or fifth sub-race in all its new characteristics. After
this, in about 25,000 years, they will launch into
preparations for the seventh sub-race; until, in con­
sequence of cataclysms—the first series of those which
will one day destroy Europe and still later the whole
Aryan Race (and thus affect both Americas) as also
most of the lands directly connected with the confines
of our continent and isles—the Sixth Root Race will
have appeared on the stage of our Round.
When shall this be? Who knows? save the great
Masters of Wisdom, perchance, and they are as silent
upon the subject as the snow-capped peaks that tower
above them. The Fifth will overlap the Sixth Race
for many hundreds of millenniums, changing with it
slower than its new successor, still changing in
177
stature, general physique, and mentality, just as the
Fourth overlapped our Aryan Race, and the Third had
overlapped the Atlanteans.... On the law of parallel
history and races, the majority of the future man­
kind will be composed of glorious Adepts. Humanity
is the child of cyclic Destiny, and not one of its units
can escape its unconscious mission, or get rid of the
burden of its co-operative work with Nature. Thus
will mankind, race after race, perform its appointed
cycle-pilgrimage. (446).

APPENDIX
Evidences of Lemuria and Atlantis.
A Megalithic Venice.
In addition to the remarkable portrait statues of Easter
Island, mentioned in S.D. II, Stanza XI, as a relic of Lemuria,
other striking evidences have lately been brought to light by
!Dr. Macmillan Brown, Chancellor of the University of New
Zealand, who has spent some years in a survey of the peoples
and antiquities of the Pacific islands, as well as these of South
America (Peoples and Problems of the Pacific. New York,
1929). One of his most startling discoveries is that of Meta-
lanim, a Cyclopean Oceanic Venice on the south-east shore of
Ponape, the easternmost of the Caroline islands. He says it is
“ten times harder to explain than the ruins of Central
America and the Andes.” The ruins cover eleven square
miles, and the stupendous walls, ten to fifteen feet thick,
are exceptional in comparison with all other megalithic
buildings. The stones are bigger, many being over thirty
tons in weight set on walls thirty feet high: they “have
stood the wear and tear of thousands of years, and 20,000
years hence will look as fresh and impressive as they do
to-day.” Dr. Brown thinks that the only explanation of such
a titanic work is the existence of “a great Oceanic empire
now sunk beneath the waves” of which the various Pacific
islands are the isolated peaks, just as the Azores, Canaries,
etc., are those of Atlantis. But even this theory does not
explain how such enormous stones were moved from quar­
ries twenty miles away, unless we add the S.D. explanation
that the builders were of great size and strength and knew,
moreover, how to move great masses by altering their polarity.
Indeed, Dr. Brown relates a legend that “two divine men
called Olochipa and Olochepa made the great stones fly
through the air as if on wings and settle into their places
on the walls.”
Another tradition points clearly to the Lemurians of
the early Third Race when there was no death, the belief
being that “men renewed their youth by sloughing their skins
like snakes.” Many tribes believe that the quickening in the
womb is but the resumption of the thread of life by an ancestral
spirit. Dr. Speiser in his book, “Two Years in the Hebrides”
describes the beauty, stature, and nobility of the Tikopians
(Polynesians) : light-coloured men with masses of long
golden hair... .god-like forms with proud regal gait.”

Evidently descendants of the “towering giants of god-like
strength and beauty” spoken of in the archaic records. The
Maori tradition of their lost homeland is given further on
in connection with Easter Island.
With reference to the statement in the S.D. that Lemuria
was destroyed by volcanic fires, Prof. John Joly (The Sur­
face History of the Earth. Oxford, 1925) says that “the
whole of the Pacific is girt round with volcanism” (124).
His remarks on cataclysmic changes are very suggestive when
taken in connection with what the archaic records tell us.
“There is obviously a mystery underlying the whole matter,” he
writes (28). “Whence come the great constructive forces which
to-day seem to be as great as they were in the remote past?...
Right across the great continents stretch the floors of ancient
seas. And geological research tells us that not now for the first
time have these continental regions risen from the ocean
to receive the light of the sun. There were repeated sub­
mergences and repeated resurrections. Finally, and
most remarkable of all, an orderly sequence has pre­
vailed in these great events; the entire surface history of the
Earth being, as it were, laid out according to a succession
of these events, sundered by enormous intervals of geological
time.”
Easter Island a Mausoleum.
Since Captain Cook first visited Easter Island in 1773,
the extraordinary statues and other Cyclopean remains have
been an enigma to anthropologists and archaeologists. A glance
at a map of the Southern Pacific Ocean shows that the tiny
islet occupies a lonely position at the eastern end of “the
great insular arc that stretches from N.W. to S.E., where
everything indicates submergence of an Archipelagic Empire”
(Brown), Ponape ^eing at the western end. Dr. Brown points
out that its native name, (meaning “Navel of World,” indi­
cates its position in that empire as “the greatest idea of a
mausoleum the world has ever seen. The line of burial plat­
forms round the coast never ceases. There is nothing hapha­
zard in the whole scheme. . . . It was a race of Alexanders and
Napoleons that conceived this Cyclopean use of the barren
islet, and had the will and power to realise the conception.”
On the platforms were placed huge images, all terminat­
ing at the hips, of which over five hundred and fifty have
been counted, ranging from 18 to 70 feet in height. Some are
still in the quarries where they were cut from the solid
180
mass of hard grey trachyte, the largest (70ft.) being still
unfinished. Near one a partly worn jade chisel was found.
In addition to the ph^Eorms, somei of which are 500ft long
and 24ft high with sites for twenty statues, there are stone
houses 100ft long by 20ft wide with geometrical designs and
animals on the walls. The statues have the back of the head
fiat and inscribed with pictographs extending down the back.
Cylinders of red volcanic stone were placed on the heads, but
were probably shaken off by earthquakes. The faces are
all of one type, quite distinct from any other in the world,
although each one is individual. Dr. Brown was struck
with the stern, defiant, imperious expression, and says that
“the lower jaws of the skulls in the funeral vaults beneath
the platforms have all the power that the chins of the images
indicate.”
Who mads them, and how such huge masses were trans­
ported from the quarries and placed in position, is as great
a mystery as in the case of Ponape. The S.D. says that the
island belongs “to the earliest civilisa­
tion of the Third Root Race” and that
ages later, after the Atlantean deluge,
some of the survivors occupied it, only
to be overwhelmed by volcanic eruptions.
It is a curious and significant fact that
the sacred image of the Maoris, now in
the Auckland museum, depicts the same
strange type and is made from the same
red volcanic stone as the Easter Island
head cylinders, a stone not found in New
Zealand. The Maoris have a tradition
that it was brought from their lost home­
land Hawaiki (Lemuria) by their ances­
tors when they first arrived in the canoe
Arawa, and taken to the sacred island
of Mokoia on Lake Roturua. They also
possessed incised stones and other relics which were destroyed
by missionaries.
It was the sixth sub-race of the Third Root Race who
“built the first rock cities out of stone and lava. One of such
great cities of primitive structure was built entirely of lava,
some thirty miles west from where Easter Island now
stretches its narrow piece of sterile ground, and was entirely,
destroyed by a series of volcanic eruptions” (Stanza XI, v.
18.1
43 ante). It was this su'b-race, the Lemuro-Atlanteans, who
first began making and worshipping images of themselves;
so that these W'eird statues, with their thin-lipped scornful
mien, probably represent some of those who “became tall with
pride” (Stanza X, v. 40), and so through self-worship rapidly
degenerated into sensuality and sorcery.
New Light on Atlantis.
Archaeological research on both sides of the Atlantic is
steadily accumulating in favour of the existence of Atlantis.
After long study and investigation, M. Robert Chauvelot, the
wellknown French explorer and scientist, supports the theory
that the Azores, Madeira, Canary and Cape Verde Islands
are the mountainous remains of a vast territory brought to
its doom by a tremendous earthquake. He calls attention to
the volcanic nature of many of these islands, and is confident
that the entire mystery of the lost continent will soon be
cleared up by continued researches.
Another French scientist, Professor Baudoin has inves­
tigated a curious inscribed rock revealed by a very low tide
in September, 1928, in the former estuary of the river La
Vie in the north-west of Vendee. Casts of the inscriptions
revealed in particular a face in profile of a type only found
in the Mayan and Aztec carvings. Professor Baudoin, who
has been familiar with this region for more than fifty years,
has long suspected that there were prehistoric sculptures on
this rock. He found that it had been carved by metal chisels
and afterwards polished, and estimated its age at about nine
thousand years. : (
Tire Initiate K. H. in Europe.
This authority having been quoted several times in these
pages, it may be mentioned that he received part of his
education in Germany and England. In a letter to Sinnett
(M.L. 44) he writes: “I may answer you, what I said to
G. T. Fechner one day, when he wanted to know the Hindu
view on what he had written.” Mr. C.G. Massey, who was
sceptical about the Initiates, wrote to Dr. Wernecke of
Weimar, who received from Professor Fechner at Leipzig on
April 25, 1883, the following: “What Mr. Massey enquires
about is undoubtedly in the main correct. The name of the
Hindu concerned, when he was in Leipzig, was however, Nisi
Kanta Chattopadhyaya, not Koot Hoomi. In the middle of
\
the seventies he lived for about one year in Leipzig and
aroused a certain interest owing to his foreign nationality,
without being otherwise conspicuous. He was introduced to
several families and became a member of the Academic Philo­
sophical Society, to which you also belonged, where on one
occasion he gave a lecture on Buddhism. . . . I also heard him
give a lecture in a private circle on the position of women
among the Hindus. I remember very well that he visited me
once, and though I cannot remember our conversation, his
statement that I questioned him about the faith of the Hin­
dus is very likely correct.” In case it may be wondered why
he used a different name, it may be mentioned that when
members of this Order have to travel in the outer world
they always do so incognito (See Parsifal, Lohengrin, and
the Legend of the Holy Grail, by A. L. Cleather and Basil
Crump, p. 58, where Lohengrin explains why he must de­
part when compelled to reveal his name and origin). It is
an inflexible law in Occultism, and in the chapter on the
Legend of the Holy Grail it is shown that the Brotherhood
of Grail Knights w7
as a mission from the Trans-Himalayan
Order.
Ancient Medicine.
In addition to Mandrake and Ginseng mentioned in
Part II, Stanza I, v. 1 (d), there are many roots, herbs and
other substances reputed to have magical and curative pro­
perties, especially in the East. Dr. Bernard E. Read, of
Peking, is a leading authority on the subject, and in a
lecture under the above title he said: “History abounds with
mystical ideas in medicine. The majority of our modern
drugs are named after some deity. The fact that all our
modern hypnotics and synthetic drugs are not so named is
evidence of the materialism of the age. The earliest medical
practitioners were what we in modern life term herbalists.
Fu Hsi, the ancient Chinese, is one of the very best types
of the philosophical element in medicine. He formulated the
theory of Yang and Y§nX [Positive and Negative], its place
in therapeutics being the use of drugs to adjust the correct
'balance of these principles in the various organs of the
body.”
Both the Chinese and the Japanese esteem seaweeds high­
ly for food and medicine. “Chemical analysis of the Algae,”
says Dr. Read, “shows them to be remarkably rich, not only
1
8
2
1

3
in iodine, but also arsenic, iron and lime, all three elements
of the utmost importance to scientific medicine.” The Chinese
also have a wonderful asthma remedy called Ephedra, and
Leprosy Seed which is a remarkable cure for the terrible
disease. The tree which furnishes the seed is a native of
Siam, and its use dates back for thousands of years. Dr.
Read has just written a book embodying his extensive re­
searches which should be of the greatest value to students
of the subject. (Chinese Medicinal Plants. The French
Bookstore, Peking, 1930).
Ancient Indian Marriage Laws.
“How wise and grand, how far-seeing and morally bene­
ficent, are the Laws of Manu on connubial life, when com­
pared with the licence tacitly allowed to man in civilized
countries. That those laws have been neglected for the last
two milleniums does not prevent us from admiring their fore­
thought. The Brahmin was a 'Grihasta, a family man, till a
certain period of his life, when, after begetting a son, he
broke with married life and became a chaste Yogi. His very
connubial life was regulated by his Brahmin astrologer in ac­
cordance with his nature” (II, 411).
Marriage, according to the Aryan law is not, then, a con­
tract for enjoyment, protection, or even progeny as a pri­
mary consideration, but as a preparation for the Samvyasa
state in which that union with the ALL is attained. The
greatest care has been enjoined in the selection of the par­
ties. Though courting and love-making in the modern West­
ern sense are unusual, the parents or guardians are required
to pay the greatest attention to the birth, relations, physique,
age qualifications, education, nature, and substance of each.
Unions so arranged seldom terminate in misery or failure.
Before the sacrificial fire, and in the presence of the god in­
voked, the bride and bridegroom exchange a few pledges in
accord with the meaning and object of marriage. The whole
ceremony is generally divided into six parts and is largely
of a symbolical nature too long to be described in this brief
summary. It is taken from an article by Professor Manilal
N. Dvivedi written for an American Oriental publication some
forty years ago, and in comparing the Indian system with
that of the West we will do well to consider carefully what
he says of its religious foundation. He writes:
184
Philosophy, as apart from religion, is not known in India.
The ideal of religion is derived more from reason than emotion.
In short, religion here consists of a closely reasoned-out theory
of the aim of existence. .. .The very foundation of Indian
society is religion. And every institution, however insignifi­
cant, is conceived with a view, and marked in a manner, to
suppress individuality and foster altruism. This sentiment
is a result of the philosophy of religion which demonstrates
the utility of an ideal of pure altruism as the aim of existence.
The unit, therefore, of ancient Aryan society is not the
individual but the family; and even the sovereign, though
apparently a despotic monarch, is no less the father of a
family, a partner in the deeds of his subjects, physical, mental,
moral. In very ancient times it would appear that the whole
people were divided into two broad divisions: the men of
(white) colour (varna), called Aryan, and the (black) abori­
gines. The varna was divided again into two classes: divijas
(twice-born), and suaras. The dunjas were those who, by
the purity of their physique and mind, were held eligible for
initiation into certain rites which constitutes the second birth.
The divijas were divided into the three classes already men­
tioned, viz., Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas.
Initiation and the Four Great Pledges are for
males only and are performed together, usually at
about the age of eight or later, according to whether
the boy is a Brahmin, Kshatriya, or Vaisya. His head
is shaved on an auspicious day, he is invested with the
prescribed marks and insignia of a Brahmacharin (student),
and his father imparts to him the sacred Gayatri mantra
which he must henceforth repeat mentally so many times
daily after prescribed ablutions and ceremonies. The family
Guru (Teacher) then initiates the boy into his order and he
remains under his tutelage for a period varying from nine to
thirty-six years, first requiring him to take the following
solemn pledges: (1) I shall observe the strictest celibacy*
*Coimpare this with the assertion in Mother India that
Hindu boys are “regularly attached to a temple” for immoral
purposes (quoted in Father India by C. S. Ranga Iyer, p.
110); also with the neglect in the West of this extremely
important aspect of a boy’s early training, and the way he
is left at the mercy of immoral and vicious companions.—
B. C.
185
(2) I shall always tell the truth; (3) I shall regularly say
the twilight and noon prayers, repeat the Gayatri, and beg
my food; (4) I shall devote myself entirely to my teacher
and the study he points out. These vows of poverty and
celibacy relate to the years of studentship. The Brahmin
learns the Veda, etc., and the secrets of Occultism.
The Kshatriya learns the arts of war and the science of gov­
ernment; and the Vaisya the methods of agriculture, economy
and commerce, these three being the principal natural caste
divisions, the fourth being the Sudra or serving class.
The student returns to his home after some twelve years
of instruction, and with the permission of his teacher enters
upon his next period of training, that of Marriage. With this
Samskara begins the Grihasthdshrama, and the married man
is able to perform all rites and ceremonies necessary for his
spiritual welfare. It is the life of all the other ashramas,
inasmuch as through and in it is obtained that training of
the heart, which complements that of the head already
acquired, and leads to that suppression of self which results
in the absolute realisation of all being one’s self (i.e. identi­
fication of one’s self with the ALL or the Soul of Humanity).
The ancients religiously preserved purity of blood, The
pollution of the Kshetra (womb), i.e. adultery, and through
it of the whole future generation, could be atoned for only by
self-sacrifice and death. Early marriages were unknown, the
status of woman was nobly superior, and longevity with
strength of mind and body was more the rule than the excep­
tion. This state of things, however, speedily altered, and
external influences led to promiscuous intercourse. Purity of
blood being thus destroyed, the constitution of the varnas
was convulsed to its very foundations. The liberal principle
of the varna having given place to the exclusive narrowness
of the Jati (caste system), individualism, in some form, dis­
placed altruism as the basis -of Indian society, which hence­
forth began to degenerate. Though several pure varnas
exist to the present day, the evil genius of narrowness and
individualism, which governs all, and which perhaps is being
daily fostered, though in another form, by the purely indivi­
dualistic influences of the West, eats at the very core of
society and drags it imperceptibly down the abyss of de­
generation and decay.
Thus, it will be seen from what follows that the life of
a Hindu is divided into four distinct stages of training and
186
experience of which marriage is the second. These stages or
periods of activity are called Ashramas, and the rites and
ceremonies accompanying them are called Samskaras (im­
pression, hence purification). The Ashramas are:
1. Brahmacharya. A period of strict studentship and
celibacy lasting from nine to thirty-six years, or
even for life if desired.
2. ■
Grihastha. Householder or Married man.
3. V&naprastha. Forest life in retirement and medita­
tion.
4. Sannyasa. Complete renunciation of self and devotion
to the ALL.
The married man begins Vdnapraslha by retiring, either
alone or with his family, into the solitude of a forest, there
to prepare himself for Sannyasa.
The writers of sacred texts thus define the religious duties
of the different nam es and ashramas, and even specify the
various callings which each should follow,—all with a view
to enable everyone, in the end, to realize the religious ideal
of the aim of existence.
The Tibetan Wheel of Life.
The demon in whose clutches the Wheel is held repre­
sents Tanha, the clinging to life which causes continual re­
birth. As Edwin Arnold puts it in The Light of Asia:
Ho! ye who suffer! know
Ye suffer from yourselves. None else compels,
None other holds you that ye live and die,
And whirl upon the wheel, and hug and kiss
Its spokes of agony,
Its tire of tears, its nave of nothingness.
The twelve divisions of the rim are: (1) Avidya,
Ignorance; (2) Samskdra, Propensities and Impulses from
previous births; (3) Vijnana, Consciousness; (4) Nama-rupa,
lit. Name-form or Self-consciousness; (5) Chaddyatana, lit.
the six ‘gates’ in man for the reception of sensations, namely,
sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch and perception; (6) Sparsa,
Contact through the sense-organs with the outer world; (7)
Vedana, Feeling; (8) Trishna, Desire; (9) Bhava, Fulness
of life, including Marriage and obtaining an heir; (10) Jdti,
Birth of an Heir which signalises Maturity and affording re-
Dirth to another egc; (121 Jaramarana, Decay and Death.
The upper and nether wo^s are portrayed within the rim.
At the top is the Heaven-world, on the left the Human and
on the right the Titan world. Below in the middle is the re­
gion of hot and cold Hells with the Seat of Judgment
(Karma), on the left the realm of Tantalised Spirits suffering
from the effects of indulgence, on the right the Animal world.
In the centre of the wheel the three vices Raga, Dvesa, Moha,
Lust, Ill-will, and Stupidity, are symbolised by a cock, a
snake 'and a pig.

Einstein on “Flashes of Insight” and Initiation.
With reference to the note on Einstein’s “flashes of insight”
ante p. 47, the following is of great interest in Lady Drummond-
Hay’s account of a dinner conversation with Einstein in Berlin
{The Sphere, April 12, 1930):—“How do I work ? I grope.”
Expressively, he spread his hands as if to seize the invisible-
“I have built my theories out of nothing, for there was nothing
to guide me, no precedent. I experimented with every idea, no
matter how ridiculous. I adventured passionately for years in
the trackless realms of imagination and possibility.” I asked
Professor Einstein what role inspiration and spiritual revelation
play in his scientific discoveries: “Inspiration comes like a
lightning flash at the end of the search. Years of work,
experiment, disappointment, groping in the darkness, are suddenly
illumined by one second of dazzling revelation. Success is a
baptism of light.”
He explained to me that his famous theory is in three
parts. “Three degrees of Initiation, like the ancients,” he
commented........He thinks the exigencies of modern life do not
leave enough time for study and meditation.
Einstein’s reference to Initiation shows his familiarity with
Oriental religion and philosophy. See Index under “Initiates”
and “Initiation”. The following is the equation in which he
expresses the basic law of the Universe, according to his new
“Field Theory” :
An Appreciation by a Sinologue.
The following review of this book by Mr. Hardy Jowett,
F. R. G. S., in The Leader (Peking) of “
July 3, 1930, is of un­
usual interest because it represents the views of one who is
equally conversant with the Eastern and Western points of
view. Mr. Jowett has lived thirty years in China and speaks
and reads the language fluently. He has travelled extensively
in that vast country, coming into close contact with people of
all tribes and classes, and is a wellknown authority whose
sympathetic attitude has given him an exceptional insight into
Oriental religion and philosophy:
“AN ORIENTAL VIEW OF EVOLUTION.”
“Interpietation of Evolutionary Scheme as Contained
in the Archaic Eastern Records.”
“It is difficult to realize the intensity and unreasonable­
ness of the reception of Helena P. Blayatsky’s The Secret Doctrine
(1888) less than 50 years ago. It was a child born out of due
time into a world not ready for it. Mr. Basil Crump has adopted
certain parts of Madame Blavatsky’s work, based on the Book
of Dzyan, and by a wealth of illustrative matter from the find­
ings of recent science attempts to carry Madame Blavatsky’s
arguments a step forward.
“The Eastern Archaic Records, translated by Madame
Blavatsky, contain an evolutionary scheme, cosmic and human,
embodied in a comparatively small number of stanzas.
“The origin of the Stanzas is veiled in antiquity and ob­
scurity, but they were introduced to Madame Blavatsky by certain
“Initiates” in whose custody they were. It is claimed that the
many esoteric schools composed of Initiates ‘have in their joint
possession the sum total of sacred and philosophical works in
MSS. and type; all the works, in fact, that have ever been
written in whatever language or characters, since the art of
writing began’. These schools, the seat of which is beyond the
Himalayas, have ramifications in China, Japan, Tibet, Syria,
and even South America. Madame Blavatsky obtained access
to one of the Trans-Himalayan schools, and after a course of
initiation and study was allowed to give out some of the
material acquired. The Secret Doctrine embodies the results of
her investigations.
Breakdown of Materialism.
“To the dull arrogant scientific mind of 50 years ago The
Secret Doctrine was literally beneath notice. In the exclusive
scientific ‘trades unions’ of those days, no theory that could
not furnish a record of descent of respectability from some
intellectual Debrett was admitted into their circles; The Secret
Doctrine was ‘not received’. Great changes have come over the
attitude of scientific research during the last few decades. The
vast extension of materialistic scientific enquiry has opened new
continents of ‘discoveries,’ but has revealed a dire poverty in
adequate interpretation of the Universe.
“Materialism which was the dominant note of science has
broken down entirely. The superior medical student who allowed
himself to become an atheist because his scalpel dissecting his first
corpse, failed to reveal the human soul, no longer exists, and
no modern scientist would dream of sweeping the heavens with
a telescope and, having failed to discover God, declare His
non-existence. It is now realized that a footrule and a weighing
scale are not enough to account for nature in any one of its
various aspects. Philosophy and science are now wedded and
each realizes the necessity of close co-operation in their attempts
to get behind phenomena. Prejudice—always born of ignor­
ance—has given way to calm consideration ; and a priori objection
to any theory, no matter how fantastic it may seem to be, is
universally held to be unscientific. The Stanzas, which Mr. Crump
puts forth and which have emerged from the mysterious East,
have a recognised claim to consideration and a right to be
judged on their own merits.
“Mr. Crump is a member of the most exclusive trades union
in the world—the English Bar. A trained lawyer, he is accustomed
to collecting evidence and applying it; moreover he is a keen
student of science, a wide reader, and a practical mechanic (He
has constructed a motor car out of odds and ends—and, it runs).
His logical mind refuses to be jockeyed into hasty generalizations,
and in his book he examines the teaching of the Stanzas, throws
the light of modern science across them, and comes to the decision
that the most recent tendencies of modern research go to
establish the validity of their teaching.
“The Stanzas are mysticism purely and simply. Science
has been mainly materialistic and objective, but ‘the apparently
unbridgeable gulf___between Science and Mysticism has grown
steadily smaller’ and this is being acknowledged by such eminent
scientists as Professor Eddington of Cambridge, by the eminent
astronomer Sir James H. Jeans, and Dr. Henry Fairfield Osborn,
America’s leading Palaeontologist, to quote a few names only.
It is claimed that all that modern science is now realizing in
its mystical outlook on world problems is contained implicitly
and explicitly in the Eastern Archaic Records, and Mr. Crump’s
procedure is to demonstrate by analogy and comparison the
truth of this assertion, and that, moreover, the esoteric doctrines
of the Orient have formulated a complete and adequate inter­
pretation of the whole course of origin and development, cosmic
and human.
The purpose of this review is not to follow Mr. Crump on
his journey to and fro between the Stanzas and his illustrative
material from Western Science. This interesting task may be
left to his readers.
“Our object is to try and remove any prejudices which may
exist in regard to the value of the Stanzas. They exist, and no
question as to their origin can be regarded as antecedent objection
to a full consideration of them. They have a right to speak and be
heard. There are, however, special reasons why they should be
examined. The neglect, so long existent, of Eastern sources of
knowledge is absolutely unjustifiable. Spengler in his Decline of
the West, has demonstrated with great force how the European
conception of History and its neglect of Oriental factors have led
to serious distortions in interpretation, and contends with every
justification that much of our world history needs to be re-written
as it cannot attain proper perspective when so many factors that
the East can supply are left out of the view. In matters of
philosophical thought and moral insight there is no doubt that
the East has important contributions to make to the West. If,
e. g., Bishop Butler’s famous sermons on Human Nature had
been written after a perusal of the section Kao Tzu in Mencius,
a very much fuller and stronger case could have been made for
the supremacy of conscience than Butler has accomplished.
Contact Between East and West.
“A recent translation of Motse (reviewed in The Leader)
shows how much the Chinese can contribute to moral theory;
some of Motse’s obiter dicta are worthy to be inscribed on a
panel in the Palace of Justice at the Hague and if other of his
utterances were taken to heart by Occidental moderns the Sermon
on the Mount would be easier to adopt. It is however in the
region of mystical philosophy, almost exactly at these
points where modern Western science is finding contact, that
the Orient can contribute. The Archaic Records read as modern
as many of our recent authors. This is to be expected from the
East. There cannot only be no reason to suppose that a thinker
encaved in mountain recesses in some Trans-Himalayan region
cannot attain to clarity in thought, but on the other hand every
reason to suppose that he can.
“ ‘The reality is in our own consciousness. There are mental
aspects deep within our world of physics. We have only regained
from Nature what man has put into Nature. Everything is relative
to human perception.’ These words read like an extract from pre-
Vedic writers, but they happen to have been written by Sir Arthur
Eddington, the distinguished Cambridge Professor. Voiced in the
20th Century they have the accent of 1000’s B. C. Madame Blava-
tsky’s dicta read no more strangely than the sentence by F. W. H-
O r ie n t C a n C o n tr ib u te K n o w le d g e .
Myers in his Survival, and students so tar apart as Oliver Lodge
and Conan Doyle speak in non-dissimilar terms. It may be
said that these distinguished savants are returning to the
simplicity of a second childhood. It is just as ^reasonable to
Suppose that mature age and freedom from distraction have
allowed their minds to reach the state of quiet and subsidence
so requisite for clear thinking.
As Myers has reminded us and as William James {Immortality)
seems to agree; may there not be implicit in the Universe a
mind, or to express it in Green’s careful language ‘a spiritual
principle which is not the Universe’ and which has within itself
the key to all Truth and which when tapped by human minds,
offshoots of itself, makes explicit that which is implicit. It is
timeless but permeates that succession we call time; it is Infinite
but capable of relation to finite minds, and is always in contact
with some minds at some time and may be with all minds at
all times. Mr. Crump’s book at least makes such a suggestion
seem feasible.”
Dr. Osborn’s Latest Estimate of Man’s Antiquity.
Since this book went to press an important interview with
Dr. H. Fairfield Osborn, by H. Gordon Garbedian, has appeared
in the New York Times for May 11, 1930, Section 10, which
opens as follows: “The prologue and opening acts of the great
drama of man’s origin took place many millions of years earlier
than science has heretofore believed, way back at a remote
period, probably between twenty and thirty million years ago.
(This agrees closely with the Oriental estimate of man as he is
now, i.e. male and female.—B. C.). Recent evidence indicates
that man was already a talking, walking, intelligent, tool-using
individual at least a million years ago, perhaps as much as five
million, and compels anthropology to share with astronomy,
physics and geology entirely new notions of time.”
Referring to Dr. Osborn’s Tertiary Dawn-Man theory, the
writer says: “If the human brain 1, 250,000 years ago had
already developed sufficiently to compare favourably with some
primitive races of to-day, we must consequently put much fur­
ther back the dim epoch when nature first began to develope
a quadrupedal unthinking primate precursor of man into the
finest tree of life, upon which were to blossom such glorious
flowers as Shakespeare, Newton, Buddha, Lincoln, and Einstein.
That momentous event began at least twenty million years ago
in Dr. Osborn's opinion.”
As we have seen in the course of this book, the Oriental
doctrine only differs from this estimate as regards the “quad­
rupedal unthinking primate precursor”, for it maintains that
man preceded all other mammals in this Round, and was never
quadrupedal, the primate precursor of science being the result
of an early cross-breed with animal females, before the element
of Mind had entered.
How the Human Hand differs from the Ape's.
In connection with illustration of the human hand facing
p. 146, Dr. Osborn’s further remarks are of great interest. He
said:
“There is a close connection between the develop­
ment of the mind and the use of the hands and the pro­
gress of invention. . . Look at your hand. Move the
thumb. You will find that you are able to
or from any other finger. In other words
it is opposable. Such a hand with such a
thumb is indispensable in holding and using
tools. Now it requires but a glance to see
that the thumb of an anthropoid ape is radically
different. It is so much shorter than a human
thumb that it is in reality but a stump...
Man’s hand, with its shorter fingers and its
highly mobile thumb, could have been inherited
only from man.” It may here be pointed out
that, according to the S. D. teaching of the
ape being a by-product of early man, the
difference in the thumb would be accounted
for by the animal heredity on the female side,
the hairiness being from the same source.
Ape-Man Theory Definitely Abandoned.
“Recent evidence has so strengthened the case against the
ape-men theory of man’s origin that we must now definitely
and forever banish the myth of ape-men descent,” Dr. Osborn
declared with deep earnestness. “Man’s past history is written
in his face, posture, gait and skull, in every tooth in his head
and every bone of his hands and feet.” Referring to those
scientists who cite certain resemblances between ape and man
swing it toward
Ape Hand.
as proof that the ape was .man’s ancestor, Dr Osborn insisted
that such characteristics are “circumstantial evidence” and are
due “either to very remote common inheritance or to the con­
vergence of the ape towards the human type. (The S. D.
explanation would equally account for them.—B.O.). The survival
of these common traits through heredity for a period of twenty
million years should not surprise us, he explained, since we
have in other members of the animal kingdom survivals of
common traits extending back five hundred million years through
stabilized conditions of heredity.”
This (if correctly reported) is by far the biggest figure yet
given by a Western authority, and according to the table, p.15‘
2,
would take us hack into the period of the ethereal prototypes,
and in fact into the previous cycle of evolution on this Earth.
According to the Indian estimates the duration of one such
cycle or Manvantara is 308, 448, 000 of our years. The estimate
serves to show, however, how closely Western science has
approached to Oriental ideas of evolutionary duration. Dr.
Chapman Andrews is reported to have stated, on his departure
for Mongolia on May 26,1930, that the Pliocene rock they worked
on last year “was too old for man.” It would appear from this
that he does not endorse Dr. Osborn’s latest figures, The Pliocene
is late Tertiary, just before the Pleistocene or Glacial to which
the million year Peking Man is assigned (See p. 152).
Growth of Mind through the Ages.
Dr. Osborn’s views on man’s mind also show his rapid
approach to the Oriental teaching which gives the mind its
separate and much longer evolution. He is here credited with
the following remarkable utterance on this subject, concluding
the article: “Of all the incomprehensible things in the Universe,
man stands in the front rank, and of all the incomprehensible
things in man the supreme difficulty centres in the human
brain, intelligence, memory, aspirations, powers of discovery,
research and the conquest of obstacles. Man has a progressive
mind. He is the only animal on this planet so endowed. Man’s
mind has grown progressively through the ages. This is a fact
holding a glowing future for the human race, and it is not
improbable that the average men and women of to-morrow may
compare favourably in intelligence with the finest products of
Nature during the past.”
The New Heisenberg-Compton Theory of Evolution.
Professors Compton^and Heisenberg, of Leipzig, have for­
mulated a new theory of Evolution which is in close agreement
with the fundamentals of the Oriental doctrine. Interviewed by
a representative of the New York Times, Professor Compton
said that he believed he had found evidence of “a directive
intelligence” or purpose, back of everything, with the creation
of intelligent minds as its reasonable goal. See ante p.30 concer­
ning the “septenary hierarchy of conscious Divine Powers, who
are the active manifestation of the One Supreme Energy.” Other
notable statements by Professor Compton are the following, with
the references to this book in parentheses:
“Biologically speaking, Life, whether it be an apple-seed
or the germ cell of man, is essentially continuous and eternal”
(74, 80).
“If there is freedom of choice, which may be considered
as an experimental fact, it follows that thoughts are not the
result of molecular reactions obeying fixed physical laws. There
must at least be some thinking possible quite independently of
any corresponding cerebral process” (31, 14).
“A survey of the physical universe indicates that mankind
is very possibly nature’s best achievement in the direction of
an intelligent evolution. We find strong reasons for believing
that, in spite of his physical insignificance, man, as an intelligent
person, may be of extraordinary importance in the cosmic
scheme” (97, 100 et seq.).
“The old-fashioned evolutionary attitude, was that the
world as we know it developed as a result of chance. The
new physics admits the possibility of mind acting on matter,
and suggests that the thoughts of men are perhaps the most
important things in the world. This conception throws new
light on the evolutionary process and gives meaning to human
life” (101).
Einstein on Space and Reality.
In an address before the recent World Conference at Ber­
lin, Professor Einstein concluded with the following remarkable
statement: “Space received scientific reality at Newton’s hand.
Gradually it prevailed and swallowed up ether and light. Now
it is about to swallow up gravitational and electro-magnetic
fields, as well as the elementary particles of matter. Space
revealed by matter is eating up matter, and so it will be left
as the sole theoretical representative of reality.” Compare this
with the definition of Space, ante p. 1.
At the same Conference, Sir Arthur Eddington (recently
knighted), spoke of the possibility of unlocking the immense
amount of energy in the sub-atomic storehouse, so that “a teacup
full of water would equal a modern power station.” For the
awful dangers of such forces, see pp. 168-9; also the section on
the Atom under Stanza V, p. 41.

B asil W o o d w a r d C rump is the
only son of the late F.O. Crump,
Q.C., whom he succeeded as
Editor of the “Law Times” in
1900, becoming also a Depart­
mental Editor of “The Field”
and “The Queen” under the same
management. Educated at Jesus
College, Cambridge, he was called
to the Bar at the Middle Temple,
working in the Admiralty Division
of the Law Courts, and making
extensive lecture tours in Europe
and America. Resigning his editorial
work through ill-health in 1911, he
has since been associated with Mrs.
A. Leighton Cleather and her son
G. Gordon Cleather (a Chinese and
Tibetan scholar) in Oriental study
and research in India, China and
Japan. To them he is much in­
debted for valuable help in the
present work, Mrs. Cleather being
one of the few surviving personal
pupils of the late H. P. Blavatsky
from 1887 until her death in 1891.
She has collaborated with him in
“Buddhism the Science of Life”,
four volumes on “Wagner’s Music
Dramas”, and other works.
D r. H enry F airfield O sborn
recently startled the world by de­
claring that the Darwinian Ape-Man
theory is “out-worn”, and offering
the Tertiary Dawn-Man in its place.
He added that, to his mind, “the
human brain is the most marvellous
and mysterious object in the whole
Universe, and no geologic period
seems too long to allow for its
natural evolution,” Much light is
thrown on both these statements in
the Oriental teaching on Cosmic and
Human Evolution outlined in this
book. It affirms that the Anthropoid
Ape is a degenerate offshoot of Man;
for Man appeared on Earth before (not
after) all other mammals, from which
he is widely distinguished by the
possession of reason and .^//-con­
sciousness. Man is shown to be the
highly complex product of Three
Streams of Evolution — Spiritual,
Mental, and Physical; the Mind
