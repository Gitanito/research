The data compiled herein is present­
ed to those Interested in the subject of
visitations from space by beings of super­
ior intelligence with the hope that they
be alerted to the fast changing conditions
as they affect this planet.
Even tho the atomic warfare never
takes place* the fact that several nations
are firing such test bombs of destructive
magnitude, is creating great mental harm
with individuals as well as monstrosities
of diabolical activity that will come in­
to manifestation at a later period and in
this respect alone warrants cessation.
Vibratory waves are penetrating into
gas belts in the crust of the earth which
are bringing increased earthquake disturb- r s
ances; effecting the atmosphere causing a V / v
repetition of storms and floods, the meet­
ing of the polar caps, but worse of all is
the hate pattern being built up in the con­
sciousness of peoples the world over.
Creative law is being violated by
this activity, threatening humanity every
where.
Black Magicians can do nothing but
destroy, They do not know how to build,
only to tear down. Psychotic minds are
unconsciously alined with them.
The Blder Brothers from Space, the
forces of the White Brotherhood are here
in greater array than any time since man
walked the earth. They have the answers.

Eugene H. Drake,
Los Angeles, Cal,
........ 0O0........
For a long time space craft have had
this planet under observation. We have
been In contact with them since 1930. At
that time we were In Santa Monica, and
contact was made in a large field where
the Santa Monica City College la now lo­
cated. Only during the past few yearB
have they choaen to reveal their preserne.
These space ships, with their discs
or flying saucers, as some call them,had
their commanders so desired, could have
and still can, take over this planet at
any time. However, they have no desire
to interfere with our life here. They
only wish to assist us in arriving at a
clearer understanding of the immutable
laws governing this and all solar eyetans
and to help us build a more wonderful,
beautiful and peaceful civilization.
Some of these space ships are huge in
length and diameter. One of the parent
ships in the upper regions above this pl­
anet 1b at least 7000 feet long, 500 foot
in diameter, with a crew of approximately
2500 beings, consisting of the officers
in charge, with pilots, navigators, obs­
ervers, technicans, scientists, and oth­
er members required in the operation of
this ship and many smaller craft being
used in their visitation plan.
These Bhips with their intricate me­
chanism are powered by a form of electro­
magnetic force. They are heavily armed
#2
with powerful ray weapons. They can operate
at tremenduoue speeds. They cruise about
27.000 miles per Jaour, our timing. Although
when traveling through outer space from one
planet to another, they use speeds far in ex­
cess of this. They do not carry fuel such
as our planes use but are able to convert en­
ergy of light into electro-magnetic force,to
propel their craft. Through the use of ray
machines they can erect a vacuum-like condi­
tion above and a round their craft to enable
them to move up or down, sideways or reverse
their direction, or hover visible or invisi­
ble; to convert their craft into a fluid li­
ke state, beaming it to where they want to
go in a very short period.
They come into our atmospheric belts from
their planets not In solid form but in an et-
heric form. Upon entering our atmosphere
they, through their superior knowledge, cha­
nge the atomic elements in the construction
of these ships and materialize them into the
density which they are now using. The beings
on these various craft are also passed from
the etherlc to a dense form of matter and ap­
pear to materialize. By speeding up the vib­
ratory frequency of the atoms of the elements
of which these craft are made, as stated be­
fore, they can move with great speeds invis­
ible to our physical sight, and when they
desired slow them down and congeal this at­
omic energy to a more solid form. There are
elements known to them of which our sclent -
lets have no knowledge or understanding, wh­
ich they use and mold in whatever form, idea
or shape they wish.
The fact that we of earth have been expl­
oding atomic bombs, and plan to use them wi­
th hydrogen or cobalt bombs in warfare, is
one of the reasons why these space visitors
have come into our density. For these vib­
ratory waves have disturbed the etheric at­
mosphere around this planet, punching holes
as it were In the same, and these waves have
penetrated lines of magnetic force and spir­
aled up to other planets of our solar system.
They have also disturbed the etherie subBt -
ance in what we call the lower and upper he­
avens around the earth and the etherie beirgp
occupying thebe realms or worlds, which are
as dense to them as our cities are to us.
Many of these Inhabitants have been moved to
portions of the stratosphere where explosions
do not disturb them.
Therefore, these space craft were sent to
investigate Such activity. Anything dlstur-
ing the etherie atmospheric belts around this
planet also effect the other planets of the
solar system; each being part of the whole.
The Commander in charge of this expedit -
ion to whom I have been talking, advised that
any wide scale atomic or hydrogen bombings
will necessitate the use of powers beyond our
conception to eliminate laboratories, airpl­
ane plants, planes, and such plants where
such bombs are made and assembled, and the
planes carrying them, as well aB take in ch­
arge the beings controlling such destructive
activity.
Many of these space visitors are from Ven-
ua, Mare, Saturn, Jupiter and Uranus, altho
some of them are coming now from other solar
systems, working in harmony with those whom
we call Elder Brothers of this solar system.
This solar system is in charge of a Great
Cosmic Being who directs all life under the
Great Creative Plan. The Elder Brothers or
Etherians work under His direct supervision.
Civilization will not be permitted to be
destroyed as it was almost during the strug­
gle between the Titans and the Atlane, LaMu-
rlane prior to the sinking of Lemuria and
Atlantis.
Should they land In our midst we would
quickly realize how inferior we are, how much
we must learn of life, brotherly love, of wh­
ich we talk a great deal but practice little,
and of the laws governing creation.
An increasing number of space craft have
assembled in the upper regions over this pla­
net. The beings on theta number more than two
and one-half millions, with millions more on
the way. They are assembling for the incr­
eased violence on the earth, the speeding up
of the so-called cold war, and also to keep
the atmosphere cleared of radio-active vibr­
ations. Not that they are particularly int­
erested in saving us from our own created
destructive activity, but to preserve the
earth Itself, of which they are the guardi­
ans, and to establish a new civilization as
needful during every New Age.
They have the situation now under their
control. They have plugged up the holes In
our atmosphere. They have sent what we call
flre-ballB blazing thru our air to purify the
same of radio-active particles and to prevent
further vibratory waves traveling to the oth­
er planets. Rather confining the same to the
where they are originating.
There are a great many different types and
classes of Space Craft in the fleets above the
earth. We would say over 250 kinds. The Fleet
Commanders use ships of the 70CO foot length
class. Sub-Commanders those of about 500O ft.
long. All of them heavily armed and promoted
against attack. As stated before, they are
manned by beings from the planets mentioned.
The far side of the earth's moon, the side not
seen by people of earth or by astronomers, is
often used as an assembling point.
The Space Craft are mostly cigar-shape
#5
and reflect a silvery-golden color. Some of
the discs are flat, some global, reflecting
a silvery light. The energy which surrounds
these craft when in motion gives forth such *
colors as blue, green, reddish blue, orange
and lavender.
The eBcort and fighter type craft are sev­
eral hundred feet long. Some 100 feet, 25
to t5 feet in diameter. They carry from 20
to 50 In their crews, are dtlven by cosmic
energy, converted into electro-magnetic pow­
er.
Another type of craft resembles a dough­
nut, carry a crew of about 50. These are
used as laboratories. They are circular ,
125 feet across, about 25 feet thick. Here
all data is checked, analyzed, and transmi-
ted to other craft. Atmospheric conditions
are scientifically studied. All magnetic
vortexes charted.
Another type is 100 feet across, circul­
ar, 25 feet thick, capable of carrying ab­
out 20 each.
The global type have several levels or
decks. These are also observational ships,
electro-magnetically driven.
Smaller disc Bhaped craft range from 50
feet across down to 15 feet. Some are 15
feet thick, others only 7 feet. They carry
crews from 8 to 2 persons. These are some
of the craft that come close to the earth
checking on all plane plantB, landing fields,
laboratories, plants where bomb parts are
made and assembled, and also where mining
operations for uranium are conducted.
Another type, controlled by larger craft
range from 15 feet across to others only 6
feet. Others only two feet across, shaped
#6
like tops. Some of these smaller craft have
been mistaken for flre-ballB, These top.
like objects are made of an electronic subs­
tance whirling at such speedB they seem tra­
nsparent. These are used for photographic
purposes by which the inBide as well as the
outside of any object or substance 1b photo­
graphed. These are controlled by magnetic
beams slalliar to our radar. Such pictures
taken are viewed on board the space ships on
what we would call space mirrors or screens,
but theirs are vastly superior to anything we
have constructed.
They have a visa-scope which they can fo­
cus so minutely as to look not only into a
room where people are but right into their
brains, watching the pulsations when they
are talking or thinking. The brain cells
throw off colorful lights as they vibrate.
Some vibrate but little. The right side of
many earth people brains are almost in a do­
rmant state.
They have an instrument that is about a
foot square on the top, and then is bell sh­
aped (somewhat like a green pepper), flat on
the bottom, which they Bet in the middle of
a craft, and from the light energy picked up
from our atmosphere by this instrument it be -
gins to oscillate. The top section moving
clock-wise. The other parts of the bell por­
tion moving both counter clock-wise and clo­
ck-wise, As this movement increases in tempo
waves of light energy are pushed out in the
ship and beyond its walls for considerable
distance and these waves are of many colors.
This motion vibrates so fast that the craft
setB up a slight humming sound, and under
control of the operator shoots out into space
at terrific speeds. This is the color seen
f
e
y earth people as the craft travels through
our atmosphere.
We have called these smaller craft and
m
discs by many names, Such a flying saucers,
"fire-balls", "foo-balls", or vortexes of
electro-magnetic energy. Some such condi­
tions do exist in our atmosphere, but they
should not be confused with any of the cr­
aft referred to herein.
Every part of the earth's surface where
destructive war activity is centered has
been viewed, all air-fields and plants ch­
arted, also all laboratories. All areas
where uranium and other minerals are being
mined for use in the manufacture of atomic
or hydrogen bombs listed. All world lead­
ers are under their surveillance. All so-
called secret meetings, plans, operations,
designs are known to these space beings.
Invidble watchers are In the midst of all
meetings, noting, recording and photograph­
ing all that takes place that has destruct­
ion in mind. Through the use of the visa-
scope they can check on every phase of our
life.
As the mission of these craft is a help­
ful and peaceful one, no harm is Intended
to any earth beings unless a hostile move
is made against them. They are now in con­
tact with certain individuals who have tak­
en up physical embodiment on earth to work
with these space beings in the unfolding of
the New Age Plan, to assist in the buJHlng
of a better civilization.
Should any hostile action be taken aga­
inst them they will quickly remove the same.
By using certain cosmic forces which they
are thoroly familiar with they would easily
disintegrate any such hostile craft before
it or any of its guided missies are disch­
arged. Airplanes would also be prevented
from leaving the ground for such an attack.
Pilots and operators could be placed in an
unconscious or sleep state unable to perform
any functions, and forte, plants or operat­
ional points disintegrated through demagnet­
ization. Hostile planes could be enveloped
In a field of force that would suspend them
helplessly in the air. They would afeo quick­
ly take in charge and using such powers un­
known to us of earth, pick up the leaders di­
recting such hostile actions against them
into the 4 th, 5th, 6th, and higher dimensi­
ons, into the presence of the Space Beings.
People would Bay they must have disappeared
in a blaze of high vibratory light. They
would make their own ships invisible travel­
ing in the midst of the hostile planes with­
out being detected. This information should
serve to convince earthlings how futile thene
efforts would be against beings of such sup­
erior intelligence. It would be wise for
earth leaders and people to concentrate on
ways of peace and brotherly love rather on
war and destruction.
Many of these smaller craft will be seen
in.the near future, during the period of gr­
eat stress coming upon the earth. Some of
the larger apace ships may be seen also. Th­
eir appearance will serve to awake millions
that there are beings of far superior intel­
ligence to earth people on other planetB.
When the new races are established in No­
rth and South America, in Africa, Australia
and New Zealand, people of earth will have
the actual experience and opportunity of see­
ing some of these Beings in dense forms; le­
arn of their great wisdom and power.
If we would realize that our astronomers
have photographed solar systems and galaxies
with millions of planets, millions of light
years from the earth, we must accept the Q*ct
that intelligent beings are dwelling and act­
ively engaged in their form of life express­
ion on a great number of planets. They are
occupied by beings whose atomic cell and or­
ganic structures are somewhat different from
#9
ours, in which they are able to function in
their atmospheric conditions juBt as we do
in the earth, and from what we are told cou­
ld learn a great deal»
Many of our scientists, musicians, poets,
etc., have received much of their understand
lng from higher minds both carnate and dis-
incamate who have drawn close and impressed
upon their consciousness ideas which they
claim as their own. This intelligence ori­
ginated in the higher spheres of conscious­
ness and was given to them that humanity be
benefited and civilizations lifted to more
wonderful expression. Many wonderful in­
ventions have been seized by unscrupulous
people, capitalized upon for their own per­
sonal gain with little real thought for the
upliftment of humanity, except they had the
financial means to purchase the same.
Many visitations have been made to the ea­
rth since its formation and cooling by these
Elder Brothers of Space, and during periods
of wars and great tribulation. This is not
the first time that the earth has been at
the doorway of a great G-olden Age. In the
history of earth's civilizations there have
been several. Five times the earth has st­
ood in the path of destruction, and several
times it has been thrown out of its origin­
al orbit. It is not now in the orbit it be^
gan its first movement in space.
ThiB is the end of a great cosmic cycle
of 2-t/2 million years, as well as an age
cycle, and a period cycle, so drastic chan­
ges are due to change the inhabitants of ths
earth as well as the earth's land areas, as
well as its position in the heavens.
Our heaven and earth are being moved al­
ong with the other planets of our solar sy­
stem through space at a tremenduous speed
#10
Into another part of the great universe, In­
to the auric field of a Central Sun, invisi­
ble now to our aBtronbmical instruments.
This will alter the face of the earth bring­
ing up now sunken bodies of land, like the
old Murlan contient, until the water area of
the earth is greatly reduced. The atmosph­
ere around the earth, the lower heavens, is
now undergoing and will continue to undergo
changes until a new heavens or atmosphere
surrounds It, vibrating at a higher more re­
fined degree.
These flying discs or saucers have been
seen in most every country on the planet.
Many hundreds of such observations have been
noted in the past few years. Many were not
seen at all. Many pages of these sightings
could be filled--made by reputable individ­
uals. Many were seen in the daylight which
refuted the idea of falling stars, fire-balls,
etc. Many were seen fairly close up. Some
pictures have been taken of them showing a
density like our own planes.
They have been sighted In many states of the
nation, In Canada, many countries of South
America, Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Ita­
ly, Prance, Germany, Russia, Sweden, Norway,
England, Spain, Siberia, Japan, and several
places in Africa, over uranium mines, and el­
sewhere.
Almost a century ago a phenomena of lights
were seen in England and became known as the
Durham Lights.
The newspapers were filled with stories of
mysterious cigar-shaped airships in 1897
seen in various parte of the country. It was
reported that the lights and men on board
were clearly seen.
On May 2 5 , 1893 a magazine called "Nature”
#11
quoted a curious phenomenon being observed
on the wintery cruise of H.M.S. Caroline by
a deck officer on watch. The lights were
of an unusual nature. Some were spread out.
Others appeared ennass. They bore towards
the north and disappeared about midnight»
Some authorities have endeavored to expl­
ain away these sightings as looming mirages
caused by layers of inverson haze, saying
they could duplicate such a manifestation In
their laboratories. Perhaps they are corr­
ect in their laboratory deductions, but they
cannot begin to duplicate even in a meagep
manner the metal used in these space ships
or the ability of Space Beings to maneuver
them in the way they do and at the speeds
they have been clocked at; all the way from
300 miles to over i8,000 miles per hour.
To correct a mass of incorrect information
given out about space ships, stars, planets,
solar systems, etc., we will endeavor to
give our readers some facta.
These space ships are composed of a kind of
element which does not show on our spectrum,
which is harder than any metal we of earth
have been able to manufacture, yet so light
that two men could lift one of these discs of
50 feet in diameter. That inBide of the space
ships they have bunks that one can push back
into place, fitting so tightly into the inner
surface of the craft that one cannot see any
evidence of them being there. Each ship hae
its panel board, we will call it, consisting
of the various push-buttons used for the op­
eration of all mechanical objects on board.
Their radar like screens, reflecting mlrras,
visa-scopes, visa-phones, radio directional
lights, electro-magnetic mechanism to pick
up light rayB concentrating them thru cryst­
als into gyroscopic instruments that create
the waves of light energy referred to before.
#12
Ray machines for magnetising or demagnetis­
ing any object, creating of vacuum conditions
or patterns, and for projecting beans of light
force from ship to earth or elsewhere.
At this time these space ships and discs
are Betting up landing tubes and broadcasting
centers all over the earth. The landing tu­
bes are about 20 feet in height, composed of
electronic substance, invisible, on which a
discs will settle and remain stationery aga­
inst a force of wind of other’factors. The
broadcasting centers will be of simillar su­
bstance, also Invisible, but capable of send­
ing beams of energy waves over the earth, al­
ong which will travel thoughts of peace, love
Joy, harmony and Justice, and as humans pick
up these thoughts both during sleep and awak­
ened state they will begin to react thereto
and put into expression such ideas. This wi­
ll be one way to break up the destructive th­
ought pattern that every nation of the earth
is now spreading upon its Inhabitants through
various channels.
The Commander of one of these Space Ships,
known as Aramia, is 5 feet 10 inches tall.
Very dignified. Solidly built, fairly broad
through the shoulders. His hair is long and
golden. The cheeks are pink, eyes large and
blue, his chin strong. He has a very pleas­
ing expression. He wearB a tight fitting
tunic of pearl shade silk, with gold and blue
trim, the collar of which is three inches
high,-open a little at the throat, with gold
tabs at the ends. On the shoulders of the
tunic are golden epaulets--somewhat simlliar
to the "boards'* worn by naval officers. He
wears tight fitting trunks of same material,
pearl silk, with a golden zipper up one side
of the calf. His shoes are a soft golden me­
tallic material. While his manner is gracious
it is very commanding. One can feel the mag­
netic force emanating from his person. His
command ship is from the Planet Venus. It is
#13
cruising some 75,000 miles above the earth.
He informs me that it is about 7000 feet
long, 500 feet in diameter, with 1500 beings
on board. The akin of the ship looks like
aluminum or stainless steel, reflects a sil­
very-golden light. It haB two entrances,
fore and aft. In the nose is a long panel
board with many push buttons, a view or sp­
ace mirror, a picture-graph, a sound wave
detector, a visa-scope, a visa-phone, a sm­
all radio like instrument which is in dire­
ct atunement with the Planet Venus. There
are several seats before this panel board at
which the various technicians sit when the
ship is in operation. We might call these
beings the pilots, co-pilots, navigator,
engineer, radio and sound technicians.
The crew is composed of Venusians from
36 to 42 inches tall. They are well prop­
ortioned. Their skin is a light cream col­
or, covered with fuzz-like hair, like the
down on a peach. Their eyes are large and
blue, with hair blonde to golden, brows
fairly heavy, arched, but little. They go
about their work silently, eyes flashing,
at times smiling. Their uniforms are li­
ght blue, close fitting, tunics and trunks,
with shoes of the same material fitting ti­
ght around the ankles. Many have gold or­
naments on their uniforms, indietlve of rank.
The Commander Aramia advises that these
little people are a specific racial type on
Venus, and that a race of little men and wo­
men are to be found on Mars as well, while.
.on
Saturn they have a race a little taller but
heavier and more gross in appearance. On
Uranus and Neptune are raceB of giants. The
little men of Venus and Mars are highly sk­
illed in the handling of mechanical and el­
ectrical machinery. You might even call
them wizards when you consider their ability
and knowledge.
#1*
This ship Ib operated in several ways.
One of them ie utilizing the cosmic magnet­
ic force in the atmosphere. This energy is
microscopic, white in appearance, and more
explosive than uranium. The ancients call­
ed vryil. It is picked up by a series of
coils and converted into power units as the
energy is concentrated thru crystals as they
move thru our etheric belts or atmosphere.
When traveling in outer space from the ear­
th to other planets or between planets they
move along lines of magnetic force at blind­
ing speeds.
The magnetic vortex that extends outward
from our poles in cone shape is several hun­
dred thousands miles in length, reaching be­
yond the moon, and when these space ships
come into our earth’s orbit they come down
thru this magnetic vortex toward the earth
from the north toward the north pole; and
this magnetic force enters the earth from the
north pole, travels thru the earth southward,
into the vortex of the south pole, while the
energy from the south pole vortex travels
over the face of the earth into the north
pole vortex. Therefore, these ships can come
from the moon into the earth's magnetic field
in Just a few hours.
By the use of certain instruments they can
create a vacuum around and before the ship,
thus having no friction or resisting force to
overcome. In other words they travel in an
atmosphere of their own creation. There ap­
pear to be tubular vents along the outside of
this craft evidently thru which they, by send­
ing bursts of magnetic force on one side or
the other can maneuver it in any direction.
Also in this vacuum they can remain stationery
As it is now cruising about 75»000 miles
above the earth many smaller craft report to
and are directed from this source. Smaller
discs can be taken aboard the mother ship by
# 15
landing on the top, then lowered inBide.
The operators of these craft when report­
ing stand at attention before one of the off­
icers or the -Commander and make their state­
ments telepathically. They salute by extend­
ing the right arm, palm up, the hand slightly
above shoulder height. When the Commander
gives an order telepathically to any of his
crew one can feel the vibratory effect of this
thought beam, and the force with which it is
directed seems to electrify those to whom it
is sent, as they snap into activity at once.
No maps or charts are used. When a cer­
tain area is to be viewed they sweep the area
with a ray beam that travels on the earth
picking up thru a top-like object which is wh­
irling at a terrific speed photographs of gr­
ound, outside as well as the inside of build­
ings, and these are shown on their- view or sp­
ace mirror together with any sounds or conver­
sations. Was astounded to see buildings, pl­
ants, airfields, and people working inside of
them, as if televised, and heard the voices
too as they came thru the sound wave detector,
Just as heard over earthly radios. When these
voices or tones are converted into picture'**
graphs we behold pictures of that which is be­
ing said or discussed. These come through ra­
pidly and with clarity. So no matter in what
language the conversation may be in, these
picture-graphB show what it is about.
All thought is universal and convey form,
and when qualified by instruments, such as
this picture-graph, Indicate the trend and pur­
pose of the conversation. When we send a tel­
epathic thought to another person it travels
in picture form on waves of etheric substance,
is picked up by our sensorlum and readily un­
derstood.
This ship and all others in the fleet are
#16
shielded against any Interfering radar waveB
of earthlings» or other space ships not In
harmonious accord with the fleets working in
the orhit of the earth. Inasmuch as our ear­
th and Bolar system Is entering the density
of the Central Sun Vela, space craft from ot­
her solar systems will begin to inspect the
earth closer, and unless their attitude is
friendly the solar space patrol challenge
them at once.
The Commander smiles when the thought Is
directed to him,
"Are there beings on other planets of this
solar system?"
He replies,
"In this vast universe thousands of plan­
ets have living beings on them. They do not
all resemble earth people, any more than ear­
th people resemble each other in color, heir
ght or facial characteristics. Some resemb­
le earth people very closely. Some beings
are part human and part animal. These are
beings in the lower phases of evolvement.
They too fell from grace or a higher status
by mating with lower animalistic forma, even
as some of the first beings on earth, called
the suns of ^ight, who married or mateii with
sub-human people."
"Your scientists and astronomers are not
quite correct in their deductions and ideas
about the planets of this solar system; about
other beings not being on them, or thinking
tba*e might be only some lower order of living
organism existing on them."
"It seems they have decided that according
to the analysis of our atmosphere on Venus,
by some of their special instruments that th­
ere is little if any oxygen and no sign of
water vapor. Hence, they believe the surface
of our planet must be like a desert, with du­
st or some strange gaseous formation in our
cloudB. That the temperature of these vislb-
le clouds or cloud layers vary as much as 0
degrees at night to 140 degrees F. in the
day. That the surface temperature would in.
dlcate that it might be as high as boiling
point* So without any apparent oxygen, no
water vapor, unfavorable temperatures, there
could hardly be any life on Venus like that
on the earth. They are mistaken. No astro­
nomer thru such Instruments as you have on
the earth has ever been able to see our pla­
net itself, nor can they say their instruments
are picking up any direct radiation from the
planet but only from visible cloud layers, and
they are not sure that such do not come from
other sources in space,"
"I assure you, that we do have life on our
Flanet Venus. Our people resemble earth peo­
ple very closely. Our cell structure vibrat­
es at a higher rate than does yours, but we
eat, breathe, and digest our foods, though so­
mewhat different than earth fruits and vegeta­
bles, yet they sustain us. we know how to as-
slmulate these foods to the best advantage.
We have water and vapor in our atmosphere. We
do not have as many people on our planet as we
had ages ago, but aside from the sub-human gr­
oup, being part human and animal, and the race
of little people, our people are much more hi­
ghly evolved than your most advanced scientists
and educators. We do not eat flesh foods of
any kind. In that one department alone we are
far beyond you earth people who are still cann­
ibalistic. When you cease to kill for food,
then you will cease to kill each other. Why
should any being wish to take the life of a
fellow being, or to eat the flesh of anyjlivlng
creature. You are still not human, only in
the state of becoming human. You have lost
control of your wlvilization as well as your­
selves, and it remains to be seen whether you
will be able to regain it, without our help.
For in your present destructive frame of mind
you are moving fast toward the destruction of
yourselves, your civilization, and if not pre-
vented might even cause the destruction of
this planet and create such stresses among
the planets of this solar system as to dis­
rupt the whole system.
The earth is the most unprogressed plan­
et of this solar system. Some day through
the purification of the golden-lavender rays
of this Central Sun and other electrical-ma­
gnetic forces from still other sources bill­
ions of your so-called light years away in
space, it will become a bright star in these
heavens. Later it will become a sun, asBOme
other planets have when its usefulness has
been exhausted.”
"Light travels at far greater speeds than
186,000 miles per second. You estimate this
speed as this energy which becomes light on
entering your atmosphere pushes itself from
one point of entrance to another by your in­
struments. But, you are finding that waves
of magnetic energy, also light, can travel
many times faster than that. The planets of
this solar system are not as far from the ear­
th as your scientist estimate and believe.
The rapidity in which the rays of light energy
travel cannot be estimated for the connections
governing the force that sends light, change.
Your sun is dependent upon the electrical for­
ces centered within it. There are many many
suns, Borne thousands of times larger than our
sun, but each sun is dependent for its brill­
iancy upon the direct electrical forces of the
spaces that concentrate upon it»"
"Space is not a tomb or a vacuum, but is
teeming with life, atomic and electrical, or­
iginating so far beyond this solar system that
minds cannot grasp such immensity. Contribut­
ing forces have to be reckoned with. They may
consist of electrical currents which, meeting
produce force. They may alBO consist of fluids
in the atmosphere. Light travels in ratio to
the condensing power of the receptacle of a
particular wave of light energy. Some can re­
ceive and register certain speed waves, others
áre capable of condensing and receiving a much
higher rate of speed. Your sun, our sul» Is
capable of registering a million waves of elec­
trical forces while the moon registers only a
few. Thus the sun becomes the greatest elect­
rical center of light waves in this solar sys­
tem. Saturn has her own condenser of llghit as
has Jupiter, while Mars, like earth is indebt­
ed in part to the sun. The sun, however, is
not a body of liquid fire as the ancients used
to think. The sun is a huge magnet, and the
rapid vibrations from the same generate elect­
ro-magnetic waves of energy which you feel on
earth, and when penetrating your atmosphere do
create light and heat. The angle at which the­
se waves enter your atmosphere determine your
seasons.
These Venusians appear to be very highly ad­
vanced spiritually, mentally and physically.
Being so pure in their thought they seem almost
angelic. Their love power is intense and ble­
nds harmoniously with the vibrations of elect­
rical waves of energy sent out pulsating in all
directions. There are women on board this sp­
ace craft. The second in command is a woman,
and a very beautiful one too.
As she comes to where the Commander and I
are standing, he turned to me and said;
"This is Estralon, our second Flight Comman­
der. She has a ship of her own."
She is about 5 ft. 4 inches tall. Has the
creamest pink complexion I have ever seen on
any girl. These Venusians all look so young it
is difficult to tell their ages. Her large
blue eyes were like mysterious pools of spark­
ling waters, full of enchantment. She is wear­
ing a uniform not unlike the one worn by the
Commander Aramia, which reveals a very trim fi­
gure. I imagine sne weighs about 115 Ids.
While I could not understand what she is saying
020
to mo in her Venusian tongue, telepathioally,
I am able to co-ordinate her delightful musi­
cal voice tones comprehensively»
I noticed the other women on board, all
in uniform, carrying out various tasks, yet
none of them could compare to EstiaLon in fi­
gure and beauty.
Her love power is intense as I am held in
its radiance. I Just seem to melt into her
presence for a moment as her magnetic aura
blends with and overshadows my own. I could
only nod my head as she is presented to me,
as 1 am still shaken from head to feet by the
dynamic wave of love in which she had envel­
oped me.
"She will conduct you on an inspection of
the ship and enlighten you further? said
Aramia.
As she is talking and indicating the diff­
erent kinds of ray machines, she stops sudden­
ly and putting a hand on my arm looks at me
again with that tender sweet smile so radiant
and powerful, that I drift momentarily away in
consciousness to a garden filled with a gamut
of beautiful flowers.
"This mechanism is a demagnetizing ray gun
which is used to disintegrate any foreign ob­
jects that might interfere with our flight,
such as sizable meteor particles. Also uBed
to deflect rays from an opposing force, such
as a space craft from another solar system
who does not enter this system in friendship."
It is not shaped like one of the guns you
see on earth on either plane, ship or ground,
but is rather a short tube through which a ray
is projected by oscillation at a terrific rate
of speed, for a considerable distance, which
demagnetizes whatever the beam is directed on.
f /
#21
"This mechanism is used to create a vacuum
around our ship which enables It to remain
stationery In this density. We can also use'
this form of energy when moving thru space
at high speeds. This pushes aside lihes of
magnetic force which would create friction
when crossed. When we travel along lines
of magnetic fcjrce we do not need this so
greatly."
Turning to another machine, she says,
"ThiB one is used to expand vibratory rays
of energy which as it increases in tempo is
pushed out in colors, such as red, blue, yel­
low, reddish-blue, and lavender. The higher
the frequency the more refined the color.
Yellow or golden-lavender ie the color you
will observe doming from the Central Sun Vela,
which I shall show you in our space-scope.
"And, this machine picks up the white en­
ergy in your atmosphere, concentrates it thru
these highly polished and various shaped cry­
stals, which immediately sets up motion, then
this motion is focused thru several instrune-
nts some clockwise, some counter-clockwise,
which enable us to project our craft in the
direction we want it to go, by directing this
colored energy through various Jets. Our dlscB
are not weighed down by heavy loads of fuel,
and when we are moving thru your atmosphere
our bodies are magnetized so they become light
also, thus we are able to move in such tight
circles, at such sharp angles, arcs, and at
speeds that would paralyze your senses,"
This machine, aa we referred to before,
has a number of various size colls, looks some­
what like copper only of a lighter shade. These
pick up the white substance, vryil, which they
claim is more explosive than uranium, by aten-
neB, and as EBtrolon states is concentrated to
some odd shaped highly polished crystals. She
let me look through a visa-scope, focused to a
#22
nth degree, which shows the motion of these
light particles aB they move in between and
through these crystals, into other instru -
ments at terrific speeds, hence this energy
is pushed out of various openings around the
craft, setting up a slight humming, showing
various colors, as viewed by earth people.
"Some of our discs have movable rims. A
near central portion moves clockwise; the
exact center being stationary. The other or
outer rim moving counter-clockwise, setting
up what you on earth would term a gyroscopic
balance, enabling the disc to turn at 90 or
180 degree angles, to make tight arcs or cir­
cles, to dip and twist if necessary while tr­
aveling at speeds ranging from a few hundred
to many thousands of miles per hour, your
reckoning," ■
■ s
*
"Other discs are controlled entirely from
a much larger disc by beamed energy, like
your radar. These also have movable rims,
and some are without any beings on board, but
have mechanism slmiliar to the type shown you
before, the (bell pepper type ) we will call
it."
"The metals used in the construction of
these disc craft are those which we have on
our planets. They are of a kind that do not
show on your spectrum. They are as elements
fused through an electro process that makes
them so durable, also so light, that we can
construct or form an entire disc in one oper­
ation. In this way we can construct a disc
in size from 2 feet in diameter to any size we
desire, say 1300 feet or even 14,000 feet.
We build a space craft, without any sections,
welding, seams, etc., in a like manner, of any
length we desire."
"If your people or leaders on earth were not
so destructively minded we would give you detail­
ed information as to how this is accomplished.
But, that must wait until you learn to live
In peace with one another, then if you of er-
rth have proven worthy of the trust and know­
ledge we may enlighten you."
1 feel like-'a particle of dust before the
superior wisdom and grace of this young lady.
"Space craft have been making landings on
the earth for many hundreds of years. There
are many references to them in your ancient
writings. They built and used them during the
time the now sunken continent of Mu was in its
height of progression, also used on the cont-
nent of Atlantis, who erected Bpace platforms
in the stratosphere. There are five of these
platforms still revolving around the earth in
its orbit. So you will understand that space
ships are not new to the earth, nor the idea
of space platforms either.
"The first beings on your planet earth were
landed by space craft. They were selected by
the Elders Brothers for their purity, wisdom,
ability and strength from those volunteering
from other planets, not only of this solar sy­
stem, but from others belonging to what le kn­
own now as a Cosmedon or Federation of planets
of other solar systems. Their instructors
were from the planets Mercury and Venus, who
when their period of instruction had ended re­
turned to their respective planets. Other
planets are now being peopled in the same way
now.
"Some planets slow down in vibratory frequ­
ency to the point where habitable life cannot
be maintained. Later such planets come to en­
ergized activity again thru the concentration
of electrical waves of light being focused up­
on them by Exalted Beings in charge of such
activity. 'Some planets become eunB. These&-
tract other bodies to them and form another
solar system.
"Every living creature upon any planet ab-
#24
aorbs and gives off currents or fluids of
electricity. How this Is given off and how
absorbed comes under a chemist s observat­
ion. But it is an established fact. These
little currents of electricity do not float
off and evaporate like dew, but they reach
out and connect with others, so your atmos­
phere I
f
l charged with electric forces gen -
0 rated by the connection of the human and
the animal."
"And this is again connected with the gr­
eater power beyond your atmosphere, till the
whole becomes so charged with electricity
that It is not only seen but Celt, when it
takes the form of 'heat lightning'. The air
has become so rarified by the rays from the
sun that these little electrons blend and
move together in visible fora. After exces­
sive lightness and expansion these electric­
al forces become detached from each other,
concentrate again, then cuts thru the air in
zig zag pattern; the result a thunder storm,
which cools the air. This 1 b what often ta­
kes place in the atmosphere around the plan­
et, but far out into space lie the clear and
tranquil ethers, stretching away beyond ast­
ronomical sightings and knowledge, intangible
without limits, yet withal real."
"Each planet has its district or orbit in
which it travels held there by magnetic force
lines, and in the ethers each separate group
of planets which you call a solar system re­
volve. There is no record that your earth
has ever left its orbit to travel in the or­
bit of another planet, tho there is record
that it has been out of its orbit to the po­
int where it wobbled like a crippled being
As it is now spinning on its axis it is chang­
ing its positionjof polarity, which is setting
up a wobbling motion. The time will come when
you will have the star Cephus as your new po­
lar star. By that time the beings on the ea-
#25
rth will have advanced to a great height in
purity, and that ie what was really meant
when the 0-reat Teacher Ebu, whom you call
Jesus, said to Peter, his disciple, "Hence­
forth, your name shall be Cephus. Upon th­
at (polarity) shall my truth be established
and it shall not pass away,"
"Not only do the planets of this solar sy­
stem have people on them, but your moon has
also, though they have been compelled, due
to its barren condition, especially, the side
which you see thru normal vision, to live un­
ground. They have instruments or machines
for the generating of their own light, heat,
and oxygen, and rarely come to the surface.
They raise their own food stuff, and are in
advance of your civilization. Xou would be
surprised to know, I am sure, that you have
beings living deep under the surface of your
planet, especially, is this true around your
south pole. These people are known to us as
"Rainbow Beings." They live deep below the
surface and have a type of civilization far
superior to your'own, with many intricate
types of instruments for the development of
their own light heat, oxygen and foodB. A
number of ray machines have been developed
by them. There are as® other races which de-
terioated. The Rainbow race are a portion
of the old Murian civilization which went un­
derground during the struggle between the Ti­
tans and Atlans. Some went in space ships to
Tibet, some to the moon and became marooned
there. Some were able to land on Mars.
"On the far eide of the moon, the side ne­
ver seen from earth, is another race of peo­
ple. There is vegetation on that side, and
this is the side that many space craft oper­
ate from. So earthlings do not get the wild
idea that you can land on the moon ana cont-i
rol it and your earth, for you will find ot­
her beings, more highly advanced, already on
it, minding their own affairs and not attemp-
#26
ting to control the earth. You of earth Bt-
111 think and act like infants, so we must
bear with you, watching you as you go stumb­
ling along, helping you when you appear to
be having great difficulty, not only to walk,
but to stablize yourselves."
"There is an ancient civilization living
underground with entrances in Mexico, and
not such a "great distance from Mexico City.
They often come to the surface and mingle
with the people, but aBlde from a few myst­
ics, the people of Mexico do not know this,
and they would have a difficult time, If
they did, to locate the entrances to their
underground cities.
"Space craft have landed for hundreds of
years in various parts of your earth where
some Df the mystic brotherhoods abide, and
where these underground civilizations still
exist. At every New Age, when the earth
and its inhabitants go thru such great ch­
anges, we of space come to your assistance,as
we are in thiB instance, in great number to
sustain those who have been atuned to the
forces of the light, to work with the great
mystic brotherhoods, and older races, to
keep the earth moving along in its journey
of becoming more illuminated, more wonder­
ful in its expression, more peaceful, more
lovable."
"There are some space craft from the Pla­
net Jupiter also working in harmony with us.*'
Later I met some of them. These Jupiter-
ians are very dignified and stately. The
leaders are very tall and dark skinned.They
have peculiar facial expressions unlike tho­
se of any other planet. Their eyes are large,
soft and very brilliant, dark brown in color.
Their faces are long, one-half longer than
people of earth. Some of them stand seven to
12 feet tall. They are very well built acc-
#27
ording to earth standards. Their women are
very beautiful, graceful and well formed and
are considered Borne of the graceful of the *
planets, even tho they have this odd facial
characteristic. Their skin is very smooth and
radiant. Some of the men wear beards."
One of these Jupiterians, Berasa by name,
about nine feet tall, revealed a great deal
about the life on that planet and gave me an
insight into their deep spiritual natures,
their wonderful ability as creators or rath­
er I should say, exponents of the perfect
type of creation. For it seems, that to Ju­
piter the other planetary leaders turn for
advice and guidance in cosmedonic affairs.
These Jupiterians are not so very differ­
ent from those of Mars and Saturn, whom I had
the pleasure of meeting later. They have a
wonderful interpretation of the Creator’s love
and power, and express it in their lives.
They have great debating societies where the (
law is expounded and questioned— Creative Law,
and a higher understanding of life is thus at­
tained. The auras of the people of Jupiter
is a wondrous beautiful thing to observe.
Those to whom their friendship is given may
account themselves as blessed indeed.
The creative mind is very strongly in evid­
enced with them. The power to produce. From
this planet is exhaled the wonderful creative
atmosphere of ideas that flow in greater force
to the earth than to any other planet closer
to them. The power to visualize things, to
conceive new conditions, new environments, new
methods of working out ideas are being inject­
ed into the earth vibration from the electric­
al work shop of Jupiter, and so they have Join­
ed with the planetary forces in bringing stron­
ger ideas and ideals to earthlings at this time.
For they declare earth people need to be impre.-
ssed with a greater sense of Justice in orderV
to dissolve the heavy vibrations now crushing
out the Light and Love of the Creator, and to
implant the seed of greater freedom among the
people, and the strength of the New Age Wisdom
Estralon is saying non, as these ideas are
going thru my mind;
"Upon all planets are beings which were cr­
eated spiritually free and no being was given
authority to control or bind another individ­
ual in its expression. For restraint creates
struggle and friction in striving to be free,
and i
,
f this is not correctly directed then
friction becomes violent and destructive. Wit­
ness this on your planet over wide areas.
Leaders in many nations are binding the peop­
le In virtual slavery, not only physically,
but mentally and spiritually. Your politic-
ana strive to regiment the voters. Governme­
ntal leaders regiment your youth into milita­
ry service, into wars created and fermented by
corrupt politlcans and munition manufacturers,
all in lust for money and power.
"Even in your worship, your church leaders
subjugate their congregations into ritualist­
ic services and ideas that have no basis of
truth under Creative Law. The Creator is Ra­
diant Light, Spirit, and should be worshipped
as such; not as a god of vengeance, or war, of
destruction, but as a God of Glorious Light,
Love, Peace, Power and everything beautiful.
"All things were created in positive and ne­
gative polarity, but each works in harmony
with each other. In energy the negative force
is cold, the positive hot, and you cannot ha­
ve light until these two are blended together.
Therefore, the negative, now turned toward mis
creation and destruction must be harmonized
with the positive and LOVE is the motivating
oil to be used to make this operation smooth
and successful.
"Earth people are prone to worship and idol-
#29
ize other individuals, war leaders, politic*,
ana, heads of governments, kings, rulers,
church dignitaries, and needed therefore, to
have saviors to lead them into a higher con­
cept of the great creative laws. On Venus
and the other planets of this solar system we
worship the Creative Presence in all forms of
expression and as the authority in all, with
no other standing between us and that Presen­
ce* During this New Age you will throw off
the shackles now binding you in ignorance of
this great law and so worship the Creative
Presence direct In all light, activity, and
wisdom. Power ana glory belongs only to Him.
Man never did have the authority to usurp it
unto himself. Only to express love in service
unto others,"
We had now stopped before the space-scope.
Estralon turned It toward the Central Sun Vela
and slid a colored plate Into It, this enabled
us to look at the terrific radiation emanating
in end thru the nine solar systems now moving
into its aurium. The aurium is full of gold­
en light. This is why this Aquarian Age is
called a Golden Age.
The other eight solar systems, besides our
own, are moving into this aurium at widely di­
fferent angles in their respective orbits. It
has taken about tOO years of our solar time to
move to the edge of this aurium and during the
next 888 years will move around the Central Sun
in this aurium, and then for another period of
400 years will gradually move out of it and be­
gin its long Journey thru six Bolar light ages
into far distance space, to the outermost lim­
its of its orbit swing; then will begin a long
trip back over six more solar light ages to
the Central Sun. All during this period this
portion of the universe will be revolving aro­
und a still greater Central Sun, and these in
turn around a Medl-Sun so far out in space that
# 3
<
5
a thousand times greater reflector than the
200 inch one on Palomar could not pick up
its radiation*
Both Aramia and Estralon state that the
Great Creative Universe around which all ot­
her universes are continually revolving is
so far out in space, quad-trillion upon quad-
trillion of our light years could not even
begin to express its distance from the earth.
New solar systems, new planets and stars
are continually being created and taking up
their positions or orbits affixed by magnet­
ic lines of force in these various universes
and cosmedons. Some planets die out, as the
atomic structure weakens, only to flare up
again ages later as new energy is built up
within it or is focused upon it from sources
far beyond it in space. Some planets become
suns, Borne stars become planets, and so life
moves along in varied forms through out the
Creative Universes.
A radiant lavender light vibrates outward
from the center of this Central Sun Vela and
harmonizes with the golden light of its auri-
um, and thus, as Estralon stated before, the
Golden-Lavender Light is the Light of the New
Aquarian Age.
We turn this space-scope on Jupiter, Mare,
Saturn, Neptune, Uranus, also on far away Pl­
uto, then over to Mercury, Venue, Aepid, Vul­
can, to Sldelius, Nevo, Krona and Absethleon.
Pluto has been mistakenly called a planet. It
is only’an asteroid. One of five such broken
off from the Planet Krona, which was partially
destroyed, and whose diameter is now about 1 5 ,
000 miles. This was a most unusual experien­
ce. This space-scope can be adjusted so as to
pick up planets so far out in space that it is
difficult to define or classify them. Some of
the planets we could look right down thru their
cloud canopieB to the planet itself. This must
X'
#31
be how they watch what is taking place on
the various planets, and more especially, the
earth.
The visa^scope is used for more minute
observation at much closer ranges. With this
instrument you could look into the secret
files of an enemy, see what their destructive
war plans are, as well as tune in on some li­
brary and read any books desired, without be­
ing obliged to go in person. To visit any
museum and see the paintings of the masters
while sitting in your home. More accurately
than if televised by us. Certainly would like
to know how this scope is built. Objectively
it seems to consist of a number of lenses and
crystals very highly polished and arranged in
such a way that they can be focused at either
close or distant range, and as minutely as we
could with a microscope of tremendous power.
This one is set in a square box like aff­
air, and as you look into it you adjust it
from the outside by pressure on certain litt­
le buttons. Really remarkable what you can
see with it. You can look thru walls, brick,
cement, iron, glass— into people’s bodies,see
how each organ functions. This would be won­
derful for locating growths or diseases. In­
to the brain to observe the thought patterns.
One could readily note whether the individual
had criminal tendencies or not. Examine the
auras of any person, and note the mode of life
She alBO showed me another instrument, the
use of which on earth would change our lives
greatly. It is called for want of a better
name a "Solar Time Machine". This can be ad­
justed so one can look into the future and see
what any person, or persons, or nations would
be doing tomorrow, next week, next month, or
ten, twenty or thirty years from now, or even
for a thousand years. It can also be adjust-
#32
ed to look in reverse back thru the past Into
■the primordial substance where all activity
is recorded and examine accurately what tran­
spired in various parts of the earth at that
period or any other period*
For example she focused it until I was able
to look back at the highest evolved period of
the Muriane who lived on the now sunken con­
tinent of Mu some 80,000 years ago. Was ama­
zed to see the high state of their civilizat­
ion. Their beautiful wide expanse cities,
with tall buildings, pyramids, flying machin­
es and space craft. Their solar lighting and
heating centers. The great solar reflectors
that picked up the sun-energy and beamed it
over wide areas in the form of light and heat,
as well as energy. Their many kinds of plan­
es— sled, bat wing, tubular, global, disc,
and many others. We looked closer into their
life activities, their temples, art centers,
( ealth centers, industrial centers. The id-
veas we have today of our progression would
be dwarfed alongside of what I am seeing now
thru this time machine*
X asked her,
"What happened to so wonderful a clvlliz-
atlonf"
Estralon adjusted it down to about 25,000
years ago. We see great explosions, whole
cities in ruins, followed by heavy earthquak­
es with outlying portions of the continent
beginning to sink, result of these earthquak­
es. An atomic warfare had started between
the Atlantians and the durians. Corrupt for­
ces had gotten control In both nations and
continued friction had resulted in an atomic
war. This set off explosions in the gas belts
in the crust of the earth creating earthquak­
es of magnitude, heavy storms and other dest-
( ictive activity with Ku sinking.
"Much had been done by certain wise leaders.
J
t
i
n
mystics, who had established centers In other
lands and sent there those whom they could
trust to carry on the knowledge, wisdom and
life that was being fast destroyed by these
two opposing fcrces," said Sstralon*
"How like the present situation on the ear­
th, with the forces of destruction and constr­
uction alined against each other in every nat­
ion on earth; and as then, so now, certain
wise men are again picking out thru careful
selection individuals who can carry the torch
of wisdom for the coming generations, placing
them in sparsely settled areas where destruct­
ion will not touch them, that the finest shall
not be lost in event the present situation gets
beyond ¿¡ontrol• At this time, however, these
groups will have the added assistance of our
space visitation. For we are landing and mak­
ing contact with the many brotherhood, mystic
leaders and some of their chosen workers,"
Were our leaders able to look into this
time machine and see what their blundering ch­
ildish acts are creating and what will happen
to the earth, its people, civilization, etc.,
they might at once turn from their wilful ways
into more constructive activity for peace.
Estralon and Aramla both state, almost in
unison:
"We whom you call space beings are not de­
ceived by your window dressing (using your own
language)— peace talks, for we are in possess­
ion of the facts. We know the secret plans in
the vaults of all nations. We know the people
of earth want peace with all other people. We
know that certain leaders do not want peace,
except as they can dictate it. We know that
your group of nations have lost control of the
situation and are not able in their divided ac
tlvlty to bring about peace. Because, within
their own ranks they are not in agreement. We
m
know the basic principles set forth when this
group was organized was not actuated by holy
premises, therefore, will not endure any more
than your past League of Nations.
"In your own language, earthman, you can­
not leave a rotten apple in a barrel and not
have the whole barrel of apples affected,
even cause.the barrel to become rotten too.
Your leaders are deceiving no one but them­
selves, but the sad part of It is they would
rather destroy a civilization, even a planet
than stand in the light of right principle
and action. Therefore, we, as Btated, will
not stand by and see this earth destroyed as
It was in the previous atomic war, even thou­
gh many of your people hardly warrant better.
"We Space Beings, your Elder Brothers,
shall if necessary, use powers beyond your
knowledge to preserve the earth and those who
will be chosen to become leaders in the New
Age dispensation.
"Mark it well, you leaders of destruction,
and we know well who you are, we are a patient
people, yet we shall move swiftly to purify
the earth of your kind when the Supreme Command
er gives us the command."
The power that this Commander manifests is
so far reaching and great that I am aB one tr­
ansfixed. I give thanks unto these Elder
