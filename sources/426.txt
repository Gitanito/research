  New Theology Magazine, The.
 The New Talk About God.

 The journal appears to have intended to attempt the unlikely task of combining "Some Neglected Truths from John Calvin" with "The Creative Power of Affirmation (I AM)" and standard New Thought topics.  "It rejects the Old Theology plan of salvation by grace and by redemption, and teaches instead salvation by aspiration and persistent purpose."   Portraits of Annie Besant, Walt Whitman, et al., poems by Ella Wheeler Wilcox and Charles Lincoln Phifer, contributions by Henry Wood, Charles Wright, Anna B. Davis,Mary Eupha Crawford, Eugene Del Mar,  et al. LOC

 Fairfield was a socialist New Thought advocate and spiritualist and the journal, and especially its predecessor, initially reflected those interests.  Fairfield was printer and an earnest seeker and intended a magazine to reflect his desires: "For many years I have been revolving in my mind the features of a progressive magazine which should not have the shallowness of New Thought, the orthodoxy of Theosophy, or the foolism baby emptiness of pseudo ‘mysticism, occultism, esotericism.'  I wanted to avoid the laxity and flimsyness of Modern Spiritism, the hypocrisy of Popular Christianism, and the insanity of the freakish cults."  The journal was the result.  In 1909 it absorbed the moribund New Thought News (which had become Constructive Thought) and attracted that journal's original publisher, Harry Gaze.  Under the editorship of Gaze, the journal began to reflect his preoccupation with physical immortality ("Mr. Gaze advanced the idea that the fountain of life is within each individual, and that men possess the power to generate human electricity to such a degree that old age is banished and life and youth perpetuated") and the value of "affirmations," adding regular columns of "New Life Daily Affirmations."  It also featuring the teachings of the Order of the 15 of F. Homer Curtiss and contributions by or excerpts from Peter Davidson on the Cosmic Tradition and primordial bisexuality.  As Fairfield gradually came under the influence of the ideas of Levi Dowling, founder of the Aquarian Commonwealth, whose work he first reviewed in January 1909, the journal became more and more a vehicle for expounding Dowling's thought, formalizing the relationship in August 1909 when it became the organ of the Aquarian Commonwealth.  Dowling (as "Levi d'Guru") began to contribute to the journal in June 1909 and filled its pages thereafter.  In 1910 the journal was formally taken over by the Aquarians, who moved it to Los Angeles in June 1910, changing the name to the Aquarian New Age Magazine in December 1910.  Noted in Frances Maule Björkman, "The Literature of 'New Thoughters," The World's Work 19, no. 3 (January 1910):  12471-12475, and discussed in John Benedict Buescher, Aquarian Evangelist: The Age of Aquarius as It Dawned in the Mind of Levi Dowling, Theosophical History Occasional Papers, Vol. XI (Fullerton, CA: Theosophical History, 2007).

 This was the continuation of the New Age Magazine of Boston and Los Angeles with the addition of "Aquarian" to the title to avoid confusion at the post office with another journal. It was the organ of the Aquarian Commonwealth of Levi Dowling (1844-1911).  He was the author of The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ, a New Thought-Theosophical retelling of the early life of Jesus as seen by him in the Akashic Records and discovered by him in his travels in the East.  Dowling began his career as a devout and active Campbellite Christian and ended up, in Los Angeles, as a model New Thought mage.  For a time his Commonwealth included the likes of Harry Gaze and J.M. Peebles, the latter of whom, with the editor of the journal, organized The Aquarian College of Teachers and Healers Under the Direction of The Aquarian Commonwealth, offering courses in healing, generating personal magnetism, the science of breathing with magnetic breathing exercises, "retaining one's power" and "magnetic leakage," and on magic in theory and practice, all attested by "Special Diplomas and Ordination Certificates."  The journal also offered, "through the good offices of a Manhatma [sic] of the Ancient Order of the Sphinx," lessons from the Tablets of Heth, with "Magian formulas."  Contributions by Peebles, W.J. Colville, Nellie Beighle, V. Cooper-Mathieson, et al.  On Dowling, see John Benedict Buescher, Aquarian Evangelist: The Age of Aquarius as It Dawned in the Mind of Levi Dowling, Theosophical History Occasional Papers, Vol. XI (Fullerton, CA: Theosophical History, 2007).  The journal was suspended after the death of Dowling in August 1911.  LOC.
