CHINESE PERSPECTIVE:  Regarding his vision of the afterlife, I have omitted that he was a traditional Chinese gentleman.  In traditional Chinese belief everyone goes to Hell! It is the place of all departed and your suffering is commensurate with the type of life that you led.  That is why Christianity was so popular as it offered an assurance of a Heaven.  Dead relatives are revered by traditional Chinese and to die is to be with one's forebears.  Not only with dying patients, but also patients about to undergo major surgery (such as cardiac bypass or cancer surgery) can have NELEs. Most of these are reflective, curative or revelatory in nature.
