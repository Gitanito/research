  		              		Experience Description   

    I have been a high-performance athlete all my life. I was working out, when I suddenly suffered a heart attack.  I was dead for 10 minutes according to the emergency first responders.  These people are part of a prehospital care group.  One of the members saw people around me and tried to help until the paramedics arrived.  It took them 10 minutes and two defibrillator charges to revive me.  Then I came back and was in a coma. 

  In that time, I could see myself from above and I could see people around me.  I remembered what they were wearing.  I also visited my parents and my little brother. I saw them in the places where they were at that time, doing their activities.  

  I wanted to find the Prehospital Care person who had who attended me.  My description of him was published in social networks for chats so that he could be found.  I did find him and now he is like another brother to me.

What is your religion now?         Christian- Catholic     

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I never thought about this. I just thought I was going straight to God.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I care too much about other people. I don't conceive of evil and can't understand overconfidence in others. I think that the things I do in my day to day are not important enough.

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Uncertain     I'm still looking for my purpose. I don't know why it happened to me, why I'm alive, or for what purpose I'm alive.  

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.       As I could describe how the civilian of the prehospital care was dressed and I could see my family individually while I was dead, then I believe the answer is yes.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     I feel that I have some connection with other things on another plane.  Sometimes the connection becomes evident and sometimes it goes away. On the other hand, I do not know what my work on earth is.  But I am sure that I must do something. I want to believe that it is something important, because it would be very sad to return from death to simply die again. I have faced a lot of insecurity about myself, I feel that I cannot achieve goals.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes, I want all people to be happy and I think more about others than me. But my ego for believing that what I do is insignificant causes me to increase my ego and feel bad.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   There are feelings that are very complicated to say.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience    

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain     I don't know, because sometimes I hear those voices.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Currently, I feel that everything I have is irrelevant and that it is not intrusive to the world.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       No      

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably real     At first, I thought it was likely, the I assimilated and I realized that if it was real  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     I know that it is real because there are many incidents of what I saw that I could verify that happened when I was dead.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   I have shared with close family members, but little talk about it given the great suffering they had felt that I had died.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I would like to start writing a book with the help of experts in the subject.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I think it could be a personal interview
