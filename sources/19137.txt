Oh
somewhere that contact humanoid and
well you know in the work with ease
asked about contact with the Atacama
humanoid origins in our work when we go
out into the stars we do a lot of work
with remote viewing consciousness and in
intuitive remote viewing I don&#39;t have
one of the CIA&#39;s electronic systems but
we don&#39;t need it you can learn to
meditate and do that naturally with
practice but we have had experiences
where more than one person have seen
whether it&#39;s exactly the species of the
Atacama humanoid very much similar very
tiny where the adults are only like a
foot 14 inches tall now all of you know
that that Akama humanoid has been
certified by the world&#39;s expert on
dysplasias and skeletal abnormalities to
be about a six to eight year old
equivalent I mean because of the the
growth plates of the long bones not just
the legs but all over the body and he&#39;s
recently asserted reasserted that and
this is dr. Ralph Walkman at Stanford
and so the question is whether that
particular being is of extraterrestrial
origin or some mix or of a civilization
that may have come been here for
thousands of years where you get these
stories that you hear around the world
of the I was talking to a man in New
York who came to my presentation about
the we people the little ones and I&#39;ve
been reported in Russia and then the
Caucasus and in Ireland then in Puerto
Rico so there is this you know you don&#39;t
know how we&#39;re mythology leaves off in
fact and evidence and and one of the
things we would like to do we may do
this year is a further of exploration of
just the atacama mystery of what that is
because it is still a mystery
in fact I was just corresponding with
the genetics guy at Stanford a couple
weeks ago and he says more of a mystery
now because they have found the area on
the genome that controls for stature
height and he says it is I&#39;m quoting
the chances that it is a mutation or a
random event is infinitesimally small
now this is a guy who heads up a lab at
Stanford with forty five PhDs under him
who sent it to the top people in the
world so this thing is more of a mystery
now than it was a year ago also in the
film series just to correct something he
at the time they thought it was a male
now they&#39;re not even sure of its gender
or if it has a gender as we think of it
all right so so maybe it&#39;s androgynous
who knows or they don&#39;t reproduce in
that same XY fashion as male/female the
point I&#39;m making is the more we learn
about it the stranger it is not less
which would point to something
extraordinary but we can&#39;t claim that we
don&#39;t know and of course there&#39;s no
genetic database of extraterrestrial
species
well maybe the National Security Agency
has one I don&#39;t but that means that the
Stanford professor doesn&#39;t either and so
what he did was run when we took the
clippings off the rib of this little guy
or girl or whatever
we took the bone marrow and and he he
got an excellent genetic sample ran it
just automated computerized wasn&#39;t done
by hand that takes years and billions of
dollars but through the 2,500 ethnic
groups that are known in on the planet
and ninety-one percent matched nine
percent didn&#39;t very large unmatched it&#39;s
thirty two thousand base pairs of
genetic material did not match in other
words completely unknown from a very
good sample at the best three reference
labs in the world so that means that now
a gorilla is 98.7 percent identical
genetically to you and me well maybe
more to me than most of you but I&#39;m big
and I&#39;m furry and a muscly so I&#39;m more
of a ape but the atacama humanoids 91 at
give you some perspective the
Neanderthal which is a totally different
species from Homo sapiens is 99.5%
identical to modern Homo sapiens so
we&#39;re dealing with something here that
we don&#39;t know now unfortunately the
geneticists had to has to refer to this
thing as a deformed human because he&#39;s
got a career to protect for one thing
but also he can&#39;t he&#39;s never going to
say a CT but of course when he said that
boom the mainstream media said Oh
mystery solved is a deformed human child
well I&#39;ve delivered a lot of premature
infants and what are called precipitous
emergency deliveries
none of them are six inches tall and
that&#39;s at birth this is six years old
and it&#39;s six inches tall I held it I was
one of the first few people have ever
held this and doing this procedure on it
oh my god it&#39;s so dry and fragile we
were afraid we&#39;re going to shatter the
whole thing but ultimately it&#39;d be great
to go to that area of the world on an
expedition but you know there aren&#39;t
funds to do that it be great if somebody
just in the scientific curiosity wanted
to fund it and come along as long as
they came along and didn&#39;t interfere
because what I would love to do I mean
it sounds terrible but you know with the
science part because what would be
wonderful is to be able to go there and
actually set up a CF eye-contact event
in the area during the night and during
the day do expeditions to areas to see
if we can find more of these because
there&#39;s reports that there are now
whether that&#39;s true or not they&#39;re a bit
apocryphal there but if there are
everyone agrees in the scientific
community we&#39;re working with if you get
two of these it&#39;s game over it&#39;s
dispositive this is not a human you
would not get to Deputy form creatures
identical that would be this bizarre
with ten ribs all the anomalies you see
in the photos and the cat scan that&#39;s on
our website so if people want to get
caught up on that if you go to serious
disclosure com there&#39;s a evidence button
and there&#39;s one that&#39;s just for the
atacama humanoid and you can catch up
with that but my own feeling when we&#39;ve
had these experiences with some of these
very very small tiny ET civilizations
they&#39;re very interested I believe that
we&#39;re sort of exploring the
possibilities of this and we don&#39;t know
if there&#39;s a direct link between those
two or maybe this is some distant cousin
or it may be something completely
indigenous to earth
that&#39;s a humanoid that we&#39;ve never known
about the earth you know the earth holds
many mysteries and and I think that if
we have to keep an open mind
about what the possibilities are
