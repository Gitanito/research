The last time I got   this excited to see a paper published was when von Lommel published his   incredible longitudinal NDE study in December 2001.&nbsp; This PhD study is well   worth the read!&nbsp; There are so many NDE, OBE, and Dream studies where the   investigators have a predetermined outcome and suffer from extreme scientific   fundamentalism.&nbsp; Many do not care that their model does not fit paranormal   phenomenon, and insist that anything that does not fit into the model is purely   fictitious.&nbsp; I can take you through some of the intriguing high lights of the   study and if you are interested, you can read the entire article to form your   own judgments.&nbsp; After going through some principals brought up by Istv'n B'kkon,   I tie these into how his research applies to the NDE and other unexplained   phenomena. &nbsp;

B'kkon uses physics   and current neurological information to explain dreams.&nbsp; Although he is cautious   to say that his model does not attempt to explain how consciousness works, it is   highly persuasive in that his explanations encompass known data described by   NDErs.&nbsp; Interestingly, he is able to draw largely on nanotechnology, physics,   and hologram technology.&nbsp; &nbsp;

B'kkon explains   that:&nbsp;

  electrical signals generate visible pictures   if electrical signals are converted to electromagnetic waves (EMW) of the   visible range (light photons of wavelengths between 350-700 nm).&nbsp; During dreams   our eyes are closed, so the brain is isolated from visible EMWs of the   surroundings, yet we can see visible dream pictures.&nbsp; It follows from the   foregoing that electrical signals of the brain processes can generate visible   pictures of dreams if and only if electrical signals are converted to weak, EMWs   of the visible range (biophotons) in the brain.&nbsp; The permanent, ultra-weak   electromagnetic light photon emission from living systems is called biophoton   emission. However, nobody can explain origin of visible dream pictures if only   the laws of physics are being taken into consideration.&quot; p62.&nbsp;

B'kkon notes that   thought and light (waves and biophotons) act as carriers of information and   action.&nbsp; He postulates that light can be a carrier of consciousness.&nbsp; Most of   the NDE accounts will substantiate this.&nbsp; In the NDE accounts, people and God   are described in terms of light.&nbsp; He also discusses that sounds, smells, tastes   and touch are all converted to electric signals and then to biophoton signals in   the brain.&nbsp; Biophoton processes can explain synesthesia, another common NDE   phenomenon. p62.&nbsp;

The way that the   brain processes information is much like a holograph by &quot;biophotons generating   visible (conscious) and invisible (unconscious, metaphor-like) pictures in the   brain.&quot;&nbsp; pp62-63.&nbsp; There are several precursor conditions for a holograph to   work in the human body.&nbsp; One observation is that living cells produce and use   electric, magnetic, electromagnetic and acoustical waves interchangeably.&nbsp;   Living cells are capable of producing coherent and incoherent photon waves.&nbsp;   Cells can be tuned to a permanent signal-bearing frequency.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Another relevant   bodily process is provided by non-calcite piezo-biocrystals.&nbsp; &quot;Piezo-biocrystals   can work as pieces of information storage units by biophotons in a holograph   like way in the brain.&nbsp; This idea was based on other kinds of biocrystals found   in the living cells.&quot;&nbsp; p63.&nbsp; B'kkon states that biophotons explain the   association of different information processes in the brain.&nbsp; &quot;When two coherent   light waves or an incoherent and a coherent wave are penetrating into a   biocrystal, light waves can exchange their information in an associational way.&quot;  Id.&nbsp;

One of the most   important issues in memory retrieval has to do with temperature regulation.&nbsp; Not   surprisingly, &quot;temperature regulation is important for many holographic systems   which use different electromagnetic photons, because holographic pictures can be   deformed if temperature fluctuations are too large.&quot; p.63.&nbsp; Temperature also   assists in developing optimal explicit memory through a structured neuron   system.&nbsp; This is necessary for &quot;strong synchronization of different electric and   biophoton signals and increase the signal/noise ratio.&quot;&nbsp; p63.&nbsp; &nbsp;

B'kkon discusses the   biological and chemical reactions that occur during NREM and REM phases of   sleep.&nbsp; During NREM, &quot;there is a decrease in blood pressure, heart rate and   respiratory rate, while REM sleep is associated with activation and increase in   the irregularity of these functions.&quot;&nbsp; p64.&nbsp; Although neurotransmitters play a   role in the neuromolecular processes, they also play a role thermoregulation and   in sleep/wake cycles. &nbsp;Id.&nbsp; The observations about neurotransmitters and   synapses from the sleep process do not address information exchange in the   biophotons.&nbsp; B'kkon gives the example:&nbsp; &quot;If depressed patients take   antidepressants or sedative drugs they can calm down.&nbsp; However, drugs change   neurotransmitters levels and many physiological functions (thermoregulation) in   the brain, but long-term information does not change in their brain.&quot;&nbsp; p66.&nbsp; He   makes the point that there is a distinction between brain molecular processes   and memory.&nbsp; &nbsp;

B'kkon postulates   that it is &quot;probable that informational processes are connected to biophysical (biophoton   or quantum) processes in the brain.&nbsp; Biophoton processes arise from molecular   (thermoregulation) processes in a cooperative way, and they influence each   other.&quot;&nbsp; p68.&nbsp; He notes it is impossible to &quot;perceive visible pictures without   visible EMW/biophontons during dreams.&nbsp; Dreams are not dependent on the presence   of contemporaneous visual-perceptual experience.&nbsp; So, there must exist an   informational system of biophotons in the brain.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; &quot;Dream pictures   make a connection possible between the explicit and implicit memory systems in   the brain, which allows us to remember our unprocessed emotional information.&nbsp;   But, visible or invisible dreams are metaphor-like, because dreams are nonlinear   holographic informational processes, and several visible/invisible pictures are   assembled together. . . The possible origin of dream emotionality is   REM-associated limbic activation, because all input information, which goes into   the brain also goes through the limbic system&quot;&nbsp; p68.&nbsp;

The REM state is   different than dreaming.&nbsp; &quot;The REM state is a cholinergic mechanism that is   motivationally neutral, but the dream states are of dopaminergic mechanisms.&nbsp;   L-dopa causes an increase in the frequency and intensity of dreaming without any   effect on the frequency of REM sleep. p70.&nbsp; &quot;Dream imagery is not generated by   chaotic activation of the forebrain, but rather by a specific forebrain   mechanism with dreams and complex cognitive processes.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; This is the   mechanism for lucid dreaming.&nbsp; &quot;REM dreams are especially important, because   they allow a connection between the explicit and implicit informational systems   of the brain.&nbsp; However, we remember our dreams if information of dream pictures   can go into our consciousness.&quot; Id.&nbsp; Interestingly, drugs can inhibit the   replay of associative visible pictures in the forebrain.&nbsp; But dreams, as   informational processes, work continuously in spite of whether we can remember   them or there is a lack of REM during sleep. p71.&nbsp; Another interesting fact is   that the brain can use dynamical pictures via biophotons, and therefore, the   hypnotic state allows a direct connection with implicit information of the brain   which works by pictures.&nbsp;&nbsp; p72.&nbsp; Hypnosis and dream analysis have been used with   a lot of success in behavior modification.&nbsp;

In the footnote, is   an interesting comment on the phase type hologram.&nbsp; B'kkon writes, &quot;The phase   type hologram produces phase changes in the reconstruction beam due to a   variation in the refractive index or thickness of the medium. &nbsp;Phase holograms   have the advantage over amplitude holograms of no energy dissipation within the   hologram medium and a higher diffraction efficiency.&quot;&nbsp; I have always wondered if   the transition from life to the other side involved a phase transition of   consciousness.&nbsp; This makes sense when one considers descriptions of NDErs   regarding the fourth (or greater) dimensions.&nbsp; Is it possible to key into the   biophoton process to enter other dimensions with our consciousness, such as the   bi-location, inter-dimensional and time travel?&nbsp;

Many intriguing   concepts from B'kkon's paper also make me wonder:&nbsp;

If science changes   its paradigm to view consciousness as light, it would open a new frontier of   mind/universal exploration.&nbsp; The fact that cells can be tuned to a permanent   signal-bearing frequency, is fascinating.&nbsp; This may provide a bridge regarding   memory retrieval.&nbsp; It could also be a basis for why hands on healing or placing   rocks on the body can help subtlety re-tune a person's energy field to health.&nbsp;   What if NDErs when they come back actually have a different cell frequency?&nbsp; The   rooms at the IANDS annual conferences feel much different than going to other   meetings.&nbsp; Cell tuning would account for why reiki works.&nbsp; Could cell tuning   also account for many of the physiological and mental/emotional changes that are   reported?&nbsp; &nbsp;

Is it possible that   piezo-biocrystals can also be a reason for why cell-memory is observed?&nbsp; For   instance, if a person directs energy through the hand on the leg, a memory could   be associated with the feeling of blockage release.&nbsp; It is well known but   unexplained that many people who undergo transplants may take on images and   thoughts from the donor's. &nbsp;

The NDE memory is   light, and therefore probably has components of coherent and incoherent light   wave that penetrates into a biocrystal.&nbsp; I had stated in earlier studies that I   thought everyone who died and who came back had a NDE, it was only certain   people who could remember them.&nbsp; Perhaps the difference between rigid and fluid   personality boundaries is based upon how individuals process the coherent and   the incoherent light waves.&nbsp; Another intriguing possibility is what happens when   the incoherent light waves are deciphered.&nbsp; This could be what helps to motivate   changes in the NDErs.&nbsp; What if we could learn to change the ratio of coherent   vs. incoherent light waves?&nbsp; Could we then cure mental and emotional problems   that we couldn't otherwise touch without heavy drugs?&nbsp; &nbsp;

Now do you see why I   was so excited?&nbsp; This paper stimulated a lot of thoughts in myself as a sort of   connect-the-dots to help me explain why some of the NDE phenomena occurs.&nbsp; It is   fascinating to see that there is now a scientific paradigm that helps explain   and values life after life ' rather than dust to dust.&nbsp; We are light, no   matter what scientific fundamentalists or skeptics may try to say.
