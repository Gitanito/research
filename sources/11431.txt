  		              		Experience Description   

    After feeling a really sharp pain in my head,  I suddenly found that I was unable to control my arms and legs with my thoughts. The sounds and sights started getting fuzzy and I was unable to speak.  The pain got more intense. I felt myself crumbling to the ground while everything faded to black and went silent.  I knew I was dying and my last thoughts were of my loved ones.  The black was as a camera shutter closing. 

   I felt as though I was being transported, but I couldn't see or hear anything.  The shutter of the imaginary camera lens opened again.  Now everything was different.  I was different and felt wonderful.  I didn't have any pain any more.  I was no longer worried about my loved ones, as I felt as though I was still with them.  But I was also with a LOT of people.  I was with everyone and everything.  I looked around and saw that I was in a  park with such beauty  I had never seen before.  The grass was manicured to perfection.  There was a large tree, maybe an oak tree, with a perfect shape.  The sky was beautiful blue, but it was somehow alive. Everything was perfect, without any decay or imperfection.  I was standing on a pathway that curved in front of me.  It was so brilliant white and yet didn't hurt my eyes.  I knew this must be Heaven and I was feeling God's love and acceptance.  

  Then my father appeared in front of me.  He had passed about 10 years before.  Here, he looked so perfect,  healthy, and happy.  I was so glad to see him and wanted to jump into his arms.   I  knew that if I went around that corner on the pathway, I could stay with my daddy forever. But my dad stopped me and said without physically speaking a word, 'You need to go back.  It's not your time yet.'  For a very brief moment, I started to protest in my mind, but I stopped myself.  If my dad was telling me this, it must be the truth and what's best and necessary for me.  My dad would never lead me astray.  I was sad, but  obeyed him. I understood that I had to leave this wonderful place.  Before I left, I saw lines of people. They were gay and straight, different colors, different religions, some were handicapped, some very young, and some who old.  These people were all holding hands,  showing love and forgiveness towards one another.

    Everything went back to black.   I felt a terrible, heavy feeling and tremendous pain again. I knew I was back in my body.  But I was not the same person I had been.   I had changed.
  
  Since I have recovered from the surgery and the coma, I have had some experiences with communication from the other side.  Now that I know that the spirits are there, I have had communication with my father.   I have seen some spirits come through who want to communicate to others through me.  Most of the time, they just want to comfort the one who has lost a loved one.  They want to let them know they are in a great place.  

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 4/22/2010  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes         Sudden Brain hemorrhage without warning.     I had a massive brain hemorrhage with five aneurysms.  I flat-lined in the ambulance on the way to the hospital and was given CPR.  Emergency brain surgery meant removing part of my brain with little hope for survival or recovery.  I'm doing well now and happy to share the great news about heaven.  
  
Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  My body was hurting and not functioning.  When I went to this place, I left my body behind.  It felt so FREE to be without it.  It was such a burden to go back into it.  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         I believe it happened when I was receiving CPR in the ambulance.  So I was unconscious.  I was in a coma for quite a while, so it could have happened during surgery or another time I was in the coma.    

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     There was no basis of time or space.  I felt as though I could be anywhere and everywhere at any time for as long as I wanted.    
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      Yes, I heard beautiful music.  I heard birds at first, and then what sounded like a chorus.  It was definitely music.  
  
Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No       

  Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes     My father.  
  
Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   The pathway was a brilliant white, which was like a light.  It seemed to call me to walk down the path.  I just knew that if I went down the path, it would get even better and I wouldn't be able to go back into my body.  It was like I was in a 'transition' place.  

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm       

  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Again, it is so beyond words.  I'd sure like to feel it again.  Euphoric is the best description I can think of.  I felt loved, forgiven, and part of everything.  
  
Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         No       

  Did scenes from your past come back to you?         My past flashed before me, out of my control.     When I saw the group of people, it was in a rock/cave-like area, very different than the park I started in.  I transitioned there in an instant.  
  
Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Conservative/fundamentalist   I was a bit judgmental and believed gay people were sinners. I was taught that certain religions were right and some were wrong.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     My religious beliefs changed, and I am much less judgmental.  I have become a Spiritualist.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Yes     I am more open, more forgiving, and far more accepting.  I also believe in things that I never believed in before, like communicating with those who have passed.  
  
After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   How do you describe the indescribable?  The beauty, the love, the euphoric feeling, the ability to communicate and be a part of everything all at once - it is beyond words.  

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I have had experiences with automatic writing, communication with spirits, and the ability to see illness in people since my experience.  It is off and on ability.  I wish I could learn more about how to use these gifts but I don't know where to turn for more information.  
  
  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The best part was seeing my dad and knowing that he is happy.  He looked so good after such a horrible and painful illness.  And now I know he will be waiting for me when I die, and that he is with me every day while I live.   The worst part was coming back.  I really wanted to stay.  
  
Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Some believe it and others are closed-minded.  I was on a show called 'I Survived, Beyond and Back' years ago.  I held a few seminars/talks about the subject.  I would love to help others understand that there is nothing to fear about death, and that if you have lost someone you should know they are in a wonderful place.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Just that it's great that you're having people write down their experiences and perhaps you can compare them and see the patterns and commonalities.  That should help to create some kind of study that may be more believable for someone who hasn't had an experience.
