I remember I was riding quite fast on my way home. Suddenly I had to get around a car that came into the street with no lights (this was at night). After passing by the car, I can't remember anything else. I would assume that I would have had time to break, reduce my speed, and continue on my way home with no problem. Instead, I remember talking to myself saying that I had really messed up big time. I cannot remember how it happened, how I felt on the ground, nothing. I just remember that I got into a big space with no limitations (no walls) dark with small yellow lights (lots of them). 

I could see two people sitting on a big table. I walked towards these two men but the distance remained the same. I remember these men were wearing purple coveralls with a strange symbol in the middle of the chest. I figure that they would be Jesus and St. Peter. I moved towards them and for some reason I sat on a chair in front of them without any word said by anybody. At a certain moment, I heard somebody walking behind me and both of the men looked to see who it was. Before I could look back St. Peter called me and we moved and suddenly we turned left, I looked back to see who was coming (could not see) and I remember calling my wife telling her about the accident.

During this time, I remember talking to myself that I was dead. For sure, I was dead once I was meeting Jesus and St. Peter. I was surprised being in a dark place as I thought heaven was blue with angels playing music.

I was not scared at any time, actually I felt myself playing around with myself saying how bad the accident was that I ended up being there.

It was very weird mainly because I do not believe on these things and I am not religious.
