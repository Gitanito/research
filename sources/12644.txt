  		              		Experience Description   

    It was a Saturday in June of 1979.  I was 17 years old.  My friend and I had planned a double-date.  We met that Saturday morning and then picked up our girlfriends with his mother's car.  We got back to his house and were sitting in the basement when his mother came downstairs. She told us it was time to take the girls home and to come back home with the car. 

  I later found out that my friend had taken the car on Friday night and that his mom was very mad about that.  

We dropped the girls off at their homes and were headed back home. We were sitting at the stoplight when my friend decided to drop the car into low gear while waiting for the green light.  He yelled, 'I’m going to blow up the motor!' When he hit the gas, I laughed saying, 'Sure you’re going to blow up the motor.' 

  We went speeding down the County Road, approaching the high school and the bend in the road.  I sat up, looked at him and yelled, 'We’re going to crash!' 

  The next thing I know, I’m in the air and looking at a square window or possibly a monitor? Everything is black around me. I feel myself standing there, but I can't imagine what my face looks like.  It’s me in the screen.  The car was speeding down the highway and hit the curb.  The car hit the telephone pole hard. 

   Then I’m thrown back into my body, gasping for air and looking around. I was thinking, 'Oh my god, that just happened!' I started looking around to see where we were.  We were sitting in the street. I looked back, behind me, and noticed the indentation from the telephone in the back quarter-panel of the car. My friend was lighting his license on fire. I told him that was foolish. He said, 'You’re right' as he started up the car.  We drove about three blocks with two flat tires when the car wouldn’t go any further. 

  I climbed out of the window on the passenger side of the car.  A police officer pulled up to me.  While I’m watching him, I notice several other police cars coming up the street. He was yelling at me to leave the scene. I told the officer that I was fine and that I knew I needed to make a statement.  Again, he demanded that I leave.  As I was walking away, all the other police officers in three or four police cars ran right past me.  They didn’t say a word to me and let me leave the scene. I felt like the first police officer had an angelic feeling to him. I remember thinking as he was walking toward me, 'Man, that man is huge!' He had blonde hair and muscles that were just bigger than I’ve seen on any man before.
